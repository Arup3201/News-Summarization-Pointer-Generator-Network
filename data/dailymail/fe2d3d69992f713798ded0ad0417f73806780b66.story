A couple caught having an office romp by a bar full of drinkers are both in serious relationships and failed to show up for work on Tuesday, it has emerged.

The sexual antics of a man and a young woman at insurance firm Marsh Ltd in Christchurch were caught on camera last Friday night after pub patrons across the road noticed the amorous couple had left the lights on.

But it has since emerged the man - a senior employee at the firm - is married and the woman, in her 20s, had become recently engaged, the New Zealand Herald reports.

Marsh Ltd told the NZ Herald that neither employee was at work on Tuesday. The company is conducting an investigation and the woman has deleted her Facebook account. 

It comes after the romp caught the eye of revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery across the street, who then posted images on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. 

The incident provoked a huge reaction with one witness saying that because it went on for 'a good half hour', patrons in the bar 'started to get bored and drift off back to the dance floor'.

‘The entire bar united in cheering them on,’ said one person on social network Reddit. 

‘It started with a casual flirt. Then the kiss, grabbing the attention of all. Get it, son! Finally they moved to the back of them room, thinking they were unseen. Off comes the tights, down goes his head. By this stage, 50 bar patrons were pressed up against the window yelling their approval.

‘To be honest, after watching them f*** for a good half hour, people started to get bored and drift off back to the dancefloor.’  

The couple had gone into the office after it had closed thinking they'd get some privacy when they were actually being watched by patrons across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery

The couple even enjoyed a glass of wine as they enjoyed their own private party

However, it got so steamy at one stage that the band even stopped playing in the bar. But when calm was restored the cheeky musicians started up again with Kings of Leon song, Sex on Fire.

'The band had to delay playing because the customers felt the need to support this view. Props to them for their next song being Sex on Fire,' one Reddit user said. 

Rabobank’s branding was also in many pictures on social media, only because it had naming rights to the building. Not that they escaped ridicule either.

‘Congrats to the man who made a deposit at Rabobank this evening,’ one Twitter follower posted.

One Reddit user said: 'I guess it's not a bank for money.' While another also quipped on Reddit: 'When he withdrew he lost interest!'

The Privacy Commissioner John Edwards told Radio New Zealand that there was little the sexy pair could do legally following some local backlash against those who filmed the incident in the bar.

Several commentators in New Zealand claimed that the couple's privacy had been breached, but Mr Edwards said it was unlikely the police could take action if a complaint was made.

‘The people who were watching, we may criticise them for a lapse of decency in taking advantage of that, but it is unlikely there'd be any legal liability for their action,’ he said.

Privacy lawyer Kathryn Dalziel also told Radio New Zealand even though the couple did not give their consent for the images to be taken, they would have to show their privacy had been breached to make a successful case under the Crimes Act. 

Revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery posted images on Facebook and Twitter of the couple

Marsh Ltd said on Tuesday they still had not made any decision on whether the couple would get the sack or face any disciplinary action.

‘We are not giving any further comment other than what has already been provided. We’re dealing with the matter internally that’s all we can say,' a spokeswoman for Marsh Ltd told Daily Mail Australia.

'It’s unknown what will happen to those involved at this stage, and what final decision will be made by the firm.’
