When it comes to the competitive world of superyachts, size is everything.

Which is why one design firm has gone all-out in its bid to attract the rich and famous, drawing up plans for a vessel based on the dimensions of an oil tanker.

Measuring 918ft in length and including a four-storey ski slope - complete with Austrian-themed Apres lodge - the mind-boggling boat is nearly double the length of the world's biggest superyacht, Azzam, owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family, which measures 590ft.

The oil tanker-sized superyacht will measure 918ft in length and will have a grand hull painted white and gold

The bizarre design is the brainchild of an Austrian firm called MOTION Code: BLUE and is planned to appeal to billionaires in the Gulf, who may like to celebrate their oil-based wealth with a superyacht designed to look like a tanker.

In fact, the world's first tanker sized yacht is called Imāra, a name based on the Arabic word for 'emirate'. 

Billionaire sailors will be able to entertain guests across the 11 decks, store five helicopters on board, receive visitors arriving at the three helipads, and relax in the four-deck-high atrium, complete with waterfalls. 

Wet garages will store tender boats and toys including speedboats and jet skis so guests can entertain themselves without having to head to the beach.

As well as a hull painted white and gold, the enormous area can be explored using custom painted BMW 13 electric cars to zip passengers form one end of the boat to another. 

The spectacular design includes space for a four-storey ski slope, complete with Austrian-style lodge, four beach clubs with access to the sea restaurants, a spa and BMW cars to zip guests from on end of the ship to another

A Suezmax oil tanker can normally hold around one million barrels of oil and burn up to 60 tons of fuel on a daily basis to power them through the water. But filling the tank will be the least of this billionaire yacht-owner's worries.

On board there will be eight two-storey VIP suites, another 12 guest cabins, theatres, four beach clubs with access to the sea, concert halls, libraries and offices.

A seafront gym will offer the perfect view while working out, along with tennis courts, an enormous spa and a selection of restaurants and a shisha bar. 

But by far the most unusual centrepiece to the superyacht will be the four-storey ski slope, in case passengers tire of constant sunshine and beach clubs, complete with an Austrian-style lodge for apres-ski. 

The superyacht has three helipads and two hangars to stores and extra two helicopters if needed, as well as wet garages for speedboats and other toys that guests may want to use

Christian Gumpold, managing director of Motion Code: Blue, said: 'Motion Code: Blue defines itself as trendsetter in yacht design and has generated and pushed many trends in modern yacht design since its foundation back in 2009.

'We have developed the world's first tanker-sized yacht called Imara, which is based on the Arabic word for 'emirate'.

'Based on the dimensions and hull geometries of common 280-metre long SuezMax tankers, the design studio's concept was to improve the aesthetics of nowadays oil tankers by developing a private tanker-based yacht with emphasis to the preferences of Middle East clients who are willing to show their national pride and their country's resources by using a modified and upcycled oil tanker as private luxury floating residence.

'The overall exterior design concept was to generate a highly precious aesthetic combined with modern architecture-like elements but also incorporating every state-of-the art-superyacht feature.

'The interior design of Imara is simply enormous.

'With a length of 280m, a beam of 57m and a total of 11 decks, Imara set clearly new standards in private yachting.

'It shows what is possible when thinking outside the box.'
