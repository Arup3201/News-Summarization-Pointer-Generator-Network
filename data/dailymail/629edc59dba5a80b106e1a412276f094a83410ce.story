Abu Qatada claims his prison uniform breaches his human rights because it is too uncomfortable

Hate preacher Abu Qatada has claimed that his prison uniform breaches his human rights because it is too uncomfortable.

The terror suspect, deported from Britain to face trial in his native Jordan, has made a formal complaint about the clothes at his new high-security prison.

Inmates at Muwaqqar prison wear beige zip-up jackets with matching beige trousers.

Qatada, 53, asked to wear a traditional flowing dishdash robe, but was ordered to don the ‘uncomfortable’ uniform – a decision his lawyer said was one of ‘several violations of his rights’.

He also claimed that having his family visits and legal consultations supervised by prison guards was an abuse of his human rights.

Qatada – once dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe – repeatedly used human rights legislation to thwart his removal from Britain.

During a decade-long legal fight which cost taxpayers almost £2million, he claimed he could not have a fair trial on terror charges in Jordan.

The radical cleric was deported earlier this month after Jordan signed a treaty saying evidence obtained through torture would not be used against him.

Qatada has previously been tried and convicted in his absence, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with 15 years hard labour. His retrial date has yet to be set.

Qatada is currently being held in Muwaqqar Jail outside Amman, where he shares a cell with 15 other inmates.

Many of the prisoners have been sentenced or charged with offences against state security. Muwaqqar is known as one of Jordan's best-kept prisons.

Colour-coded textbooks and maps are lined up in the prison's libraries and there is a computer room for the inmates.

The prison has 240 solitary confinement cells, but Qatada has been placed in a communal cell, where he will bunk with other inmates.

Home Secretary Theresa May did what so many politicians 
have failed to do and saw Qatada finally flown out of Britain, leaving 
RAF Northolt at 2.46am on Sunday July 7.

The
Al Qaeda fanatic – who was pictured smirking through the window as his 
plane took off – is now locked in a Jordanian jail after being formally 
charged with two terrorist conspiracies.

He was transferred there from Belmarsh prison in South East London.

Qatada's deportation brought to a close a 
legal circus which lasted for almost ten years and cost the British 
taxpayer £1.7million.

Millions more were spent on surveillance and will 
continue to be spent on state handouts for his wife and five children, 
who remain in the UK.

The 
payments were made despite the UK government trying to have Qatada 
removed because he was wanted on terror charges in Jordan.

The controversial preacher has been 
charged with plotting al Qaeda-inspired terror attacks and detained in a
prison in Jordan's capital Amman.

Charges
faced by Qatada cover a foiled plot against the American school in 
Amman and an alleged attack on Israeli and American tourists during new 
year celebrations.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
