A man shot four relatives and three neighbors before turning the gun on himself after finding his mother dead on the couch, police claim.

Joseph Aldridge, 36, allegedly opened fire in four separate locations on Thursday night after his 74-year-old mother Alice, who had been ill, died  at home in Texas County, Missouri.

Armed with a handgun, he shot two male cousins, their wives, and three neighbors before shooting himself in his pickup truck on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, a neighbor told Daily Mail Online.

An initial investigation suggests Aldridge had been feuding with his cousins for years.

Authorities identified four of the victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. 

The shooter was a cousin to the male victims.

Local media identified the other three victims as Darrell Shriver and Shriver's son and daughter-in-law, Carey and Valerie Shriver.

Shriver's wife Martha was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. His grandson had hidden in another room and is staying with relatives while his mother is treated.

A neighbor told Daily Mail Online that everyone in the small towns of Tyrone and Summersville are aware of each other, and that 'he probably killed 10 per cent of the town's population last night'.

Joseph Aldridge, who used one handgun in the attacks, is believed to be the cousin of some of the victims.

All victims lived within a three mile radius of each other. 

Alice L. Aldridge, 74, the suspect's mother, 'died of natural causes' on the couch and is thought to have been dead for more than 24 hours before being found Thursday night.

The woman died of a heart attack, the Summersville man said.

Police discovered her while looking for her son. 

Her death may have sparked the suspect to go on his rampage, Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker told the St Louis Post-Dispatch.

Joseph Aldridge has a minor criminal history, according to the local sheriff. 

Three other victims, from a different family, have not yet been identified.  

Police first heard of the incident when a young girl called about gunshots at 10:15pm on Thursday evening

The Summersville resident said that there had been an ongoing feud between the suspected shooter's family and some of the victims.

John Shriver, 72, of Tyrone, said that he was called by a relative to check on her son. After arriving at the son's house he found him and his wife dead in their bedroom. The couple's son was hidden safely in the closet.

A frightened girl called the police around 10.15pm on Thursday after hearing gunshots and fleeing to a neighbor's house. Two bodies were later found in the girl's home.

The barefoot girl was crying that her parents had been shot and was only wearing a nightgown, the neighbor told the Associated Press.

Her legs had been cut up after running through a field full of thickets. 

Five more bodies were found in three additional residences, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol.

One woman, believed to be Martha Shriver, was injured with a gunshot wound and is in the hospital. She is expected to survive.

Joseph Aldridge died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his GMC pickup, which was in the middle of highway WW.

He did not leave a note. 

Troopers began an investigation in the area following the shootings. A resident reported that authorities were knocking on doors at 3.45am on Friday.

The state-wide Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting the small town in the investigation. 

Authorities did not release a suspected motive for the killings and are not looking for any other suspects.

Staff of the Houston's school district were told to arrive early for counseling, according to the Houston Herald.

Superintendent Scott Dill said that residents of the close-knit community are in a 'state of shock' and he has been trying to help kids come to grips with the situation.

'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents,' he told Daily Mail Online. 

Texas County, Missouri is an Ozark region of about 25,000 people located east of college town Springfield and south of Army base Fort Leonard Wood.

Tyrone is located in the southern portion of the county, south of Houston, the county seat, which has about 2,000 residents.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the shootings were 'a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.'

Department of Mental Health in the state have also made contact with local authorities to provide crisis intervention services and counseling.  

Autopsies will be performed over the weekend.
