Chelsea full-back Cesar Azpilicueta has praised the impact of fellow Spaniards Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas who have made an instant impact at Stamford Bridge.

Costa has fired Chelsea to the top of the Premier League with ten goals with Fabregas collecting 11 assists for the Blues already since arriving in the summer.

Azpilicueta, who has now played over 100 games for Chelsea, sees the Spaniards as an integral part to their unbeaten start to the campaign.

'I knew they were good additions to the team,' Azpilicueta told Sport magazine. 'They're getting very good goals and assists and making the team play better.

'Costa is a strong player. He holds the ball, he can shoot with the right foot and the left foot. I think he is a complete player who can make the difference at any moment. You cannot give him any space.'

Azpilicueta has also hailed the work of manager Jose Mourinho: 'He has changed everything, I think,' added the Spaniard.

'The first year was difficult, but now we have the stability he brings. He's one of the best, and I think both as a club and as a team we are improving.

'I think we go step by step, though, game by game. It's a long way until May.
