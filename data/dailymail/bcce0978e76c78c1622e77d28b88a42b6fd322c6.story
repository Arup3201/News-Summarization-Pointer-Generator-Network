What's more annoying than when you've preened and groomed, ready to pose for that perfect portrait ... only to have it photobombed by an idiot?

No wonder this hawk looks so cheesed off after a wasp flew into frame just as he was about to have his picture taken.

The bird of prey looked wide-eyed and open-mouthed at  the insect  as it buzzed boldly around his head during the shoot in Seattle, Washington, looking angrier by the second.

Refusing to have his moment in the spotlight ruined, the hawk then tried to eat the wasp, but it danced about his snapping beak before flying away to safety.

Wasp are you doing? No wonder this hawk looks so cheesed off after a wasp flew into frame just as he was about to have his picture taken

Buzz off! The bird of prey looked wide-eyed and open-mouthed at the insect as it buzzed boldly around his head during the shoot in Seattle, Washington, looking angrier by the second

Elena Murzyn, 22, captured the image of the Cooper's hawk looking startled as the yellow and black striped insect buzzed in front of him in Seattle.

The student, from Spokane, Washington, took her first photo at the age of 13 and couldn't believe her eyes when the hawk was photobombed.

Elena, who also works as an animal caretaker, said: 'The Cooper's hawk in the photo is actually an imprint falconry that was raised by a falconer.

'In the photo, he is just over two months old, and due to his human-reared upbringing, talks, chirps, and screams his thoughts constantly.

'What made the photo so fantastic was seeing this incredibly talkative bird literally stop mid-scream to focus on the unexpected wasp so near his beak.

Lucky: Keen animal photographer Elena almost deleted the snap but was left in stitches after spotting it while scrolling through her camera's memory card 

'If you look closer, you'll notice that at the moment of the photo, only one eye is actually focused on the wasp.

'The other is still in the direction he was looking a fraction of a second earlier.

'The sequence of photos before and after shows his scream start, freeze, start again, and then end as he tries to eat the wasp - it was incredible.'

Fantastic: She said, 'what made the photo so fantastic was seeing this incredibly talkative bird literally stop mid-scream to focus on the unexpected wasp so near his beak'

She said: 'I did not realise I had managed to capture such a rare moment on film until I ran through the photos later that evening.

'I knew there had been a wasp buzzing around while I was out with the camera, but I told myself it was probably well out of focus and a lost chance anyway.

'The wasp was only there for a span of perhaps two seconds.

'I was tapping the next arrow repeatedly through the photos desperately trying to find one that highlighted the excellent lighting over his feathers, and deleting the ones that looked even slightly off in the same motion.

'I remember tapping past this one, getting maybe three or four past it, pausing, and tapping back slowly.

'I laughed harder in that moment than I had all week.

'That instant reaction of hilarity is why I love this photo and from what I've heard and seen, it seems to be a pretty universal reaction.'
