President Giorgio Napolitano is resigning from his post and retiring, the Italian government announced today.

The 89-year-old president will leave his post after Italy's six-month presidency of the European Union ends today, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced.

Napolitano agreed to a second term in 2013 after a deadlocked election left Italy in a political crisis.

Stepping down:Giorgio Napolitano, 89, is imminently retiring as President of Italy, it was announced today

There is no clear favourite to replace Napolitano, although former Prime Minister Romano Prodi and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, have been mentioned as potential candidates.

'I would like us to salute Napolitano, a committed Europeanist who in these hours will leave his post,' Prime Minister Renzi said in a speech to the European Parliament today, 

The Italian president plays little part in day-to-day
politics, but has the power to choose a prime minister and
dissolve parliament, a crucial role in the last few years which when a divided parliament struggled to agree on a government.

The upcoming election of Napolitano's successor carries political risks for Prime Minister Renzi, a 40-year-old centre-left leader who has been in power for almost a year.

Big task: Prime Minister Matteo Renzi now face the difficult task of finding a strong presidential candidate to replace the 89-year-old political veteran

Some analysts believe Renzi will push for new elections if he
cannot find broad support for a new candidate.

Napolitano was first elected to parliament in 1953 and became president in 2006 as a prominent member of the Democratic
Left, the rebranded Cold War-era Communists.

Former PM Romano Prodi is said to be among the possible candidates to replace Napolitano

His supporters say he has been an anchor of stability in the
country's political maelstrom, while his detractors see him as
a relic of a discredited political class and
accuse him of overreaching his powers.

He is expected to formally resign on Wednesday.

Laura
Boldrini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, parliament's
lower house, will name the date for the election of his
successor by 1,009 parliamentarians and regional
representatives, which must begin within 15 days.

The voting, which requires a two-thirds majority in the
first three rounds, can be highly unpredictable, with lawmakers
using the secret ballot to scupper candidates and settle
political scores.

Renzi said this week he was confident a president could be
chosen in the fourth round, when only a simple majority is
needed.

The search for a new president will be closely watched by
other EU countries, who will be hoping it does not cause instability in the
euro zone's third largest economy. 

They are already concerned by
elections due to take place in Greece on Jan 25 which point to a likely victory
for the far-left Syriza party. That election was triggered by the failure of the country's prime
minister to win support for a president.

The search for a new Italian head of state comes at a difficult time
for Renzi. He is thought to have many enemies in his own Democratic Party (PD)
who resent his uncompromising leadership style and oppose his
plans for reform of the electoral law and the labour market.

Meanwhile the economy is still in recession a year after Renzi took
office while promising a rapid recovery. He has also struggled to
produce the deep reforms requested by the European Commission.

The reform process is likely to come to halt while
parliament is occupied with the election of a new president.
