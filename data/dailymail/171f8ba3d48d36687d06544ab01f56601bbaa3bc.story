 Minnesota's oldest living woman recently tried to open a Facebook account to connect with family and friends, but thanks to her advanced years she had to lie about her age to do it.

Anna Stroehr, who recently celebrated her 114th birthday, is simply too old for Facebook's account creation page.

The undaunted Plainview woman simply knocked a few years off her age and created her account as a 99-year-old. 

Forever 99: Seen here celebrating her 114th birthday at a party with family and friends held at her Minnesota retirement community this past Sunday, Anna Stoehr had to lie while creating a Facebook account because it doesn't allow users to be any older than 99

Silver surfer: Stoehr's love of technology may have come late in life but she's now an avid FaceTime user

Anna's interest in technology came a little late in life, but that hasn't stopped her from adopting as much of it as she can.

Not only does she have Facebook now, but the woman who holds the honor of being America's seventh oldest living person is also a frequent FaceTime user on her iPad.

Anna first became interested in Facebook thanks to her friend Joseph Ramireza, a Verizon sales rep who once sold Anna's 85-year-old son Harlan a phone for her, according to KARE.

'I just sold him the iPhone and he was talking about his mother and I realized Harlan was 85 years young and I was just astounded,' Ramireza said.

He was even more shocked when he learned Harlan's mother's age. 

Still has a sense of humor: Stoehr has always had a curious nature, according to her 85-year-old son but she turned to old tech to write a letter to Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. 'I'm still here' is all it read

The two became fast friends and now Ramireza is a sort of technology guide for ever-curious Anna.

'She's become something of a kindred spirit,' Ramireza told KARE. 

Ramireza has taught his friend to email and use Google and now he's helping Stroehr petition Facebook to get her real age on her account.

She dictated a message for him type out on a typewriter and mail to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.

'I'm still here,' it read.

Anna is awaiting a response. In the mean time, she celebrates her 114th birthday on October 15.

Friends and family held a birthday party on Sunday at her Plainview retirement community.
