When relatives of James ‘Whitey’ Bulger’s many victims finally got a chance to address him in court during today’s sentencing hearing, they held nothing back, hurling abuse at the 84-year-old convicted killer.

At least a dozen family members of people Bulger was convicted of executing were expected to speak at the two-day hearing.

The first to do so was Sean McGonagle, the son of Bulger victim Paul McGonagle. He called Bulger ‘Satan,’ a ‘domestic terrorist’ and a ‘sad, lonely and irrelevant old man.’

Bulger, wearing an orange prison 
jumpsuit, stared down at the papers littering the defense table and did 
not look at victims' relatives as they spoke.

Monster: Former mob boss and fugitive James 'Whitey' Bulger, 84, was called a 'little sociopath' and 'Satan' by his victims' relatives and prosecutors during the sentencing phase of his trial

When asked by the judge if he wished to address the court, the mobster curtly replied, ‘No.’

The
octogenarian was convicted in August in a broad indictment that 
included racketeering charges in a string of murders in the 1970s and 
'80s, as well as extortion, money-laundering and weapons charges.

Assistant
U.S. Attorney Brian Kelly called Bulger a ‘little sociopath’ as he 
urged a judge to sentence the infamous South Boston gangster to life in 
prison.

‘The defendant has 
committed one heinous crime after another,’ the prosecutor said. ‘The 
carnage that he has caused is grotesque.’

His attorneys said he refused to 
provide any information to probation officials preparing a report for 
Judge Denise Casper, who will sentence him Thursday morning.

Closure: Steve Davis, brother of murder victim Debra Davis, said in court today that he would have like to strangle Bulger so he could feel what his sister felt in her last moments

Devastating outcome: In August, jurors could not agree whether Bulger was involved in the 1982 killing of Steven Davis' sister, Debra

Attorney J.W. Carney Jr. said he would make no sentencing recommendation because his client believed his trial was a sham.

Bulger also called his trial a sham in August after he was not allowed to use as a defense his claim that a now-deceased federal prosecutor gave him immunity to commit crimes. He did not testify.

The federal jury that convicted Bulger found prosecutors proved he played a role in 11 of 19 murders.

Jurors found the government had not proven Bulger participated in seven other killings and were unable to reach a verdict in another. But Casper ruled Wednesday that relatives of all 19 people can speak at the sentencing too, despite objections from Bulger's attorneys.

Bulger, the former head of the Winter Hill Gang, fled Boston in 1994 ahead of an indictment and spent more than 16 years as a fugitive before being captured in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2011.

In court Wednesday, emotions ran high as sobbing and enraged widows and children of those Bulger had killed in the course of his long career as a mobster offered their impact statements.

Sean 
McGonagle addressed Bulger as 'Satan' before recalling in 1974 how the 
defendant had murdered his father, Paul, when Sean was 11 years old.

'In
1975, you called and said "Your father is not coming home for 
Christmas." When asked who this is, you stated, "Santa Claus,"' 
McGonagle said. 'Today I hope we find some semblance of peace and 
closure.'

Steven Davis, whose sister Debra was allegedly strangled to death by Bulger in 1981, said that he would have liked to repay her accused killer in kind.

'This man has built up so much hate in my heart I’d like to strangle him myself,' a sobbing Davis said. 'I hope Whitey dies the same way my sister did - gasping for breath.'

In August, the jury was unable to reach a verdict in Debra Davis' killing.

Patrick Callahan, whose father was killed by an assassin on Bulger's orders in 1982, called the criminal a 'coward' for refusing to turn around and face him and other witnesses, Boston.com reported.

Better days: Whitey Bulger wrote in a recent
letter from prison that the 16 years he spent on the run with his 
girlfriend Catherine Greig were the best of his life (pictured together 
here in an undated photo)

Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California

David Wheeler, son of Roger Wheeler, 
held up a picture of his slain father as he called Bulger a 'punk' and 
stated that he and his family have nothing but contempt for him.

'And you don’t even matter anymore,' Wheeler said. 'You're a bag of jailhouse rags on cold steel.'

The
aggrieved relative also had some choice words for the FBI, saying that 
corruption within the agency was as much to blame for his father's death
as was Bulger.

‘The 
government claimed that my family was at fault. The FBI won the first 
round, but they won't win the second,' he said, adding that he lost his 
faith in the American government.

Marie
Mahoney, daughter of William O'Brien, was 11 years old when her father 
was killed some four decades ago. She recalled crying for months when 
the family got the news.

Bulger's story has captivated the city for years. He rose from a South Boston housing project to become the most feared person in the city at the same time as his brother, William, became the president of the Massachusetts state Senate.

Traveling man: Bulger, seen here in an 
undated photo that was shown at his trial, was on the run from about 
1995 to 2011 but now he will spend the rest of his life behind bars

Helped by a relationship with a 
corrupt FBI agent who shared Bulger's Irish ancestry and was willing to 
turn a blind eye to his crimes in exchange for information on the 
Italian-American Mafia, Bulger ruled violently over Boston's criminal 
world.

In 1994, on a tip that arrest was imminent, he fled the city. Agents caught up with him in June 2011, living in a Santa Monica, California, apartment with his girlfriend, a cache of weapons and $800,000 in cash.
