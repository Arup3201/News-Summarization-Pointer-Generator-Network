Television personality Peter Overton is on the mend after a serious health scare last week, his wife Jessica Rowe told Daily Mail Australia.

The Channel Nine newsreader is recovering in hospital after undergoing spinal surgery on Monday.

'He is doing really well, we got a bit of a fright over the weekend because it was quite sudden,' Jessica said.

The 48-year-old journalist was in constant pain while reading the news last week and had lost almost all feeling in his right arm and hand, according to 9news.com.au.

Nine explained that he took leave for treatment on Thursday and an MRI scan revealed that he had a ruptured disc near the top of his spine.

The risk of permanent nerve damage was so great and his pain so bad that a neurosurgeon made the decision to operate 'almost immediately'.

'But he is doing really well and I am under instructions to bring a really good coffee, a double shot.'

On the mend: Channel Nine newsreader Peter Overton is recovering in hospital after undergoing spinal surgery on Monday. He posted a selfie to Twitter with wife Jessica Rowe by his side and she has told Daily Mail Australia that the sudden nature of her husband's back problem gave them a' fright'

Nine newsreader Peter Overton, 48, has been wracked with pain for more than a week while on the set of the 6pm news and had lost almost all the feeling in his right arm before being diagnosed with a ruptured disc and undergoing emergency back surgery to avoid permanent damage

The news veteran shocked the industry when he posted a selfie from his hospital bed, the popular presenter pictured with oxygen tubes in his nose and with wife Jessica by his side.

'My darling wife a delight 2 see after emerging from spinal surgery,' he captioned the image uploaded to Twitter.

'& Tks my [Channel Nine] mates 4 fab support,' he added.

The 48-year-old was believed to be suffering back problems at work recently and looked like a shadow of the typically smiling face that's beamed into Australian homes each night for the 6pm bulletin, as he recovered in hospital from an operation to relieve what was originally believed to have been a pinched nerve.

It's since been revealed the problem was much more serious and Peter risked permanent damage if surgery was not undertaken to fix a ruptured disc. 

The TV personality looked pale and a little shaken, clad in a white hospital gown.

'He’s recovering, the great news is the surgery went really well and his doctor is really pleased and he is expected to make a full recovery,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'He’s already looking forward to getting back to work as soon as possible and doing the school runs so I can get back to work too.

'The signs are good after the way it happened, the urgency of it because it was so unexpected, he’s recovering well, so we can’t ask for any more than that.'

The TV golden couple have been married for 11 years and two daughters, Allegra, eight, and Giselle, five. 

Peter's post about undergoing spinal surgery prompted an outpouring of support for the newsreader, who joined Channel Nine in 1991 as a sports reporter for Nine News. 

Friends as diverse as celebrity chef Matt Moran, Today Show host Deborah Knight, and radio presenter Ben Fordham all sent their best wishes to the popular presenter.

Writing on Twitter, Deborah Knight wished Pete well, writing, 'Oh Pete- no wonder you were in pain! Speedy recovery.'

Jessica's Studio 10 co-host and Shark Tank  presenter Sarah Harris wished the couple 'lots of love' while 2GB presenter Ben Fordham said, 'Hope you're OK,Pete.' 

MasterChef and Paddock to Plate star Matt Moran wrote, 'get well buddy'.

Peter has been an enduring face on Australian television screens for almost 25 years.

After beginning as a sports reporter, he eventually became a contributor for 60 Minutes and now anchors Nine's nightly news bulletin.

Some of his more memorable and award-winning TV moments include his coverage of the Thredbo landslide disaster in 1997, co-anchored by Tracy Grimshaw, and the Queensland floods stories which saw him win a joint Logie in 2012.

He was awarded another Logie - shared with the Nine News team- in 2014 in honour of the network's coverage of the Blue Mountains bushfires. 

Peter Overton has had a coveted news career, winning several Logies, most recently in 2014 as part of Nine's bushfire coverage

Before Pete's surgery it appeared Jessica, 44 and her media personality husband are expanding their property portfolio, having purchased an investment property on Sydney's North Shore just before Christmas, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The modern two-bedroom apartment is located in the landmark Cammeray Towers building, the newspaper reports, and boasts water views of Middle Harbour, and a balcony.

It is unknown how much they purchased the property for, however recent sales in the same block have been snapped up for between $800,000 and $1.1million.
