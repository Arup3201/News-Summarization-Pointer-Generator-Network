The United States is now the world's biggest supplier of oil overtaking the world number one, Saudi Arabia, according to latest output figures.

A surge in US oil output, which includes natural gas liquids and 
biofuels, has swelled 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since 2009.

The spike in oil production is the fastest expansion over a four-year period since Saudi Arabia's output surge from 1970-1974, energy analysis firm PIRA said in a statement.

It was the latest milestone for the US oil sector caused by the shale revolution, which has upended global oil trade. While still the largest consumer of fuel, the rise of cheap crude available to domestic refiners has turned the United States into a significant exporter of gasoline and distillate fuels.

Last month, China surpassed the United States as the largest importer of crude, according to the US government, as the rise of domestic output cuts the U.S. dependence on overseas oil.

'(The US) growth rate is greater than the sum of the growth of the next nine fastest growing countries combined and has covered most of the world's net demand growth over the past two years,' PIRA Energy Group wrote.

'The US position as the largest oil supplier in the world looks to be secure for many years,' it added.

Total liquids produced by the United States, which PIRA defined broadly to include supplies such as crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and biofuels, should average 12.1 million bpd in 2013, pushing it ahead of last year's No. 1 supplier, Saudi Arabia.

Output from the OPEC state also rose last year, but the gains lagged those from the United States, the consultancy said.

Shale production remains a controversial industry in the U.S. however, due to fears over the impact on the environment.

PIRA said the increase in oil from 
shale, which has been centered in areas such as Eagle Ford in Texas and 
the Bakken in North Dakota, has seen U.S. supply grow by 1 million bpd 
in 2012 and again 2013.

The 
United States still lagged both Saudi Arabia and Russia in production of
 just crude oil by abut 3 million bpd, PIRA noted. Rounding out the top 
10 oil suppliers were China, Canada, UAE, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and 
Mexico.

Fracking involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to crack shale rock holding oil and gas reserves deep underground.

It generates around 43 per cent of oil and 67 per cent of the current natural gas production in the United States.

First, engineers drill down through up to 10,000 feet of earth to reach a shallow layer of shale.

They then turn their drills sideways to bore thousands of feet horizontally

Then vast amounts of sand and chemicals are pumped into the hole under high pressure - a technique called hydraulic fracturing - which creates fissures in the shale.

The fissures allow the gas locked in the shale to escape back along the pipe and up the well to the surface.

Fracking in the US first began in 1949. According to the US Department of Energy as of 2013 at least 2million oil and gas wells in the US had been hydraulically fractured.

CONCERNS

There are fears, however, that toxic chemicals used in fracking may contaminate underground water supplies, a problem which will only grow as fracking proliferates, environmentalists warn.

Case studies have shown that residents living near some fracking sites can ignite water that comes out of their taps.

Tests in Wyoming found high levels of methane, ethane, diesel and phenol in water supplies which could have been caused by nearby fracking.

Concerns also surround increases in earth tremors, believed to be caused by injecting fluid at high pressure into geological structures.
