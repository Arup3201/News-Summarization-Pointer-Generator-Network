A mother left unable to walk or talk after suffering a massive stroke has defied the odds to complete a university degree - by blinking.

Dawn Faizey Webster was left with locked-in syndrome after the attack in 2003, two weeks after her son Alexander was born.

The condition is where a patient is fully-aware and 
awake - but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis 
of nearly all muscles in the body, except for the eyes.

Incredibly, the former teacher, then 30, discovered she could still communicate through her eyes and tiny head movements.

Ms Faizey Webster, now 42, was left with locked-in syndrome after the stroke. She has now defied the odds to complete a degree, thanks to a specialised laptop that translates her eye movements into text

Ms Faizey Webster (left in 2000 at her teacher training graduation from Wolverhamptom University and right on her wedding day), had been suffering high blood pressure during her pregnancy which preceded the stroke

She has now achieved a 2:2 degree in Ancient History and written an autobiography - all thanks to a  specialised laptop that translates her eye movements into text.

Living at her parents home in Rugeley, Staffordshire, she began her degree in 2008, determined not to be beaten by the condition.

And finishing
 the Open University qualification has been no mean feat as her fastest writing pace of 50 words per hour has meant each three hour exam
 has taken three weeks.

Ms Faizey Webster, now 42, worked three-hours a day on the degree, nudging buttons either side of 
her head to move the cursor on the screen and blinking to register the 
letters.

Six years on, she has completed the course with honours and is now 
hoping to tackle a Masters in History of Art.

Ms Faizey Webster said: 'When I passed my degree, I was so pleased and proud of myself.

'I had achieved my goal that I had for six years been striving for.

'No matter 
what obstacles were in my way, such as getting pneumonia twice and other
 lesser illnesses, I was determined to reach my goal.

'When I first had my stroke, I realised I would not be able to do anything physical.

'I then decided to use the thing that had not been affected and that was my brain.

After the stroke, she disovered she could still communicate through her eyes and tiny head movements - and embarked on a degree in Ancient History

Six years on, and with each three-hour exam taking three weeks, she has graduated with a 2:2. Ms Faizey Webster's parents and full-time carers, Alec and Shirley, say they are delighted with her achievement

'I felt I needed to prove to myself and to others that I was still me, Dawn.'

She added: '[My computer] is my lifeline. Never did I imagine when I got pregnant with Alexander that my life would turn out like this.'

Her problems began when she was rushed to hospital at 26 weeks pregnant in and was diagnosed potentially fatal pre-eclampsia - a pregnancy condition associated with high blood pressure.

Over the next six days her health deteriorated, until her tiny baby had to be delivered by emergency caesarean weighing just 1lb 8oz.

A week later Ms Faizey Webster returned home - still suffering high blood pressure - but was told she would be fine.

But another week on, her high blood pressure triggered a stroke. Recalling the day she suffered the attack, she said: 'When I woke up that morning I immediately knew something was terribly wrong. I felt dizzy and faint.

'I had pins and needles in my right side and when I went to speak, my voice was horribly slurred.

'The last thing I remember properly is my mum, Shirley, saying: "Squeeze my hand if you are able", because by that stage I couldn't speak.

Ms Faizey Webster (left, 29, and right, aged 24, at a christening) had been a keen traveller before the stroke

She said 
she was vaguely aware of a tracheostomy tube going into her neck to help
 her breathe and a tube being put into her nose.

'I
 could hear traffic going by [and remember] a nurse washed my hair.' But
 was was missing, crucially, was her ability to speak.

'My mind screamed that my brain was fine. But as I couldn't speak, no one could hear me shouting that inside my paralysed body, my brain was still alive,' she said.

'Simon [her now ex-husband], my parents and older brother Mark visited daily.

Over
 the following week, she drifted in and out of consciousness but was 
unable to move or talk. Her condition got so bad her eye muscles even 
were paralysed.

She listened, motionless, while her family discussed her condition and doctors told her husband to prepare for the worst.

Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is fully-aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all muscles in the body, except for the eyes.

Total locked-in syndrome is a version of locked-in syndrome where the eyes are paralysed too.

It can be caused by a traumatic brain injury, a brain stem stroke or medication overdose.

There is no cure for locked-in syndrome, nor is there a standard course of treatment.

A therapy called functional neuromuscular stimulation, which uses electrodes to stimulate muscle reflexes, may help activate some paralysed muscles.

Several devices to help communication are available.

Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

'They would talk to me, talk to one another and to the nurses,' recalls Ms Faizey Webster. 'But all I could do was lie there hopelessly watching them, listening for snippets of news about how Alexander was.

'For long hours, I lay staring up at a blank ceiling, living for visiting hours when at least I could hear my family's chatter.

'Inside I cried, but no tears came out. When people saw me, they had no idea I was as wide awake as ever.'

No
 matter how hard she tried, Ms Faizey Webster was unable to move her fingers to tell 
people she was still alive and was left staring at the ceiling as the 
weeks passed.

A
 breakthrough came when she was finally able to blink, and let her 
father Alec, who had been at her bedside the entire time, know she was 
still inside her broken body.

'My dad asked me if I could hear him - and told me to blink if I could. [When] I blinked, he jumped up in shock.'

She
 was soon fitted with the laptop that allowed her to communicate, but 
her joy was short lived as just months later her husband Simon walked 
out.

'When Simon left me it was a crushing blow; I had always believed we married in sickness and in health,' said Ms Faizey Webster.

'I was sure if it had been the other way round - and this had happened to him - I would always have been there for him.

'He
 later wrote a letter to me saying he had cried about what we had lost 
together. He had found our cottage somehow haunted and changed without 
me. 

'He saw us both as victims, alone and confused. But I felt betrayed.'

Ms Faizey Webster said: 'When I passed my degree, I was so pleased and proud of myself. I had achieved my goal that I had for six years been striving for'

Speaking yesterday about his daughter's progess, Ms Faizey Webster's father, who is her full-time carer along with wife Shirley, 75, said they were 'over the moon' with her progress.

The 80-year-old said: 'It's amazing she has managed to do this considering her condition. We are so proud of her. She worked so hard to get there.

'Before her stroke she used to love travelling. Egypt was one of her favourite places to visit because of her love of history.

'She lived a very active life. She used to like walking and going to National Trust properties up and down the country.

'It was heartbreaking to see her go through all of this. But she hasn't given up. She has her bad days, as anyone in her situation would, but she is determined to keep going.

'We have to look after her 24/7. We took her and Alexander to Warwick Castle the other day, there wasn't access for her into the Great Hall so when we came back she contacted the castle to say there should be better access for people in wheelchairs.

'She is very proactive about things like that.

'She is graduating in October up in Manchester, it's going to be such a proud moment for us all.'
