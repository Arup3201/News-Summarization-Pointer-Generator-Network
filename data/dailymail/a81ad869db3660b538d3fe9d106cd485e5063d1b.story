They were reportedly forced to undertake 'jiggle tests' to determine their fitness levels, warm up in a frigid storeroom that smelled of gasoline and put up with leering men at their calendar-release party. 

Now, a former Buffalo Bills cheerleader has told of her nightmare ordeal as part of the NFL squad.

Alyssa U, who was initially 'thrilled' to become a 'Buffalo Jills' cheerleader, claims she was forced to endure degrading treatment and was 'treated like a piece of meat' by her supervisors.

She says she was ordered to pay $650 for her uniform, attend 'humiliating' events that left her open to groping and sexual comments and adhere to a strict set of rules dictating how she should live her life.

And despite her and her teammates' hard work, the 23-year-old claims they were paid a pittance, earning money from just a few small tips and occasional appearance fees.

Alyssa, who does not wish to disclose her full surname, reportedly made only $420 for more than 800 hours of work, while her teammate, Maria, earned just $105.

'People really thought we had it good, that we were paid well and had this luxurious lifestyle,' Alyssa told the New York Times. 'Seriously? I ended up feeling like a piece of meat.'

Speaking of her decision to leave the squad and never again return, she added: 'It came down to this: What self-worth do I have? I am 100 percent happy with myself without this.'

In May, Alyssa, Maria and three other cheerleaders sued the Bills - a team that each year makes revenue in excess of $200 million - alleging flagrant violations of state minimum wage laws.

They claim they were wrongly classified as independent contractors by Stejon Productions, which manages the Jills and failed to compensate them for hundreds of hours of work in 2012 and 2013.

'We had always dreamed since we were little girls of becoming Buffalo Jills cheerleaders and unfortunately it was anything but a good experience,' Alyssa told WIVB.

'[They made us do] everything from standing in front of us with a clipboard and having us do a jiggle test to see what parts of our body were jiggling and if that was something she saw, then you weren’t performing at all.'

In addition to 'jiggle tests', Jills cheerleaders were also reportedly forced to cover their own travel expenses during team appearances, and purchase and resell 50-75 swimsuits calendars.

Once, they were required to attend a 'Men Show' at a casino, where they were leered at and grabbed by punters, while a  calendar release party started at midnight at another casino, it is said.

1. When several of the same utensils are offered, start with the outermost utensil and use one for each course. In a formal setting, the silverware will be removed with the dish, leaving you with a clean slate.

2. When cutting meat. Never cut the full piece of meat all at once. Cut as you go, American style (cut and switch fork to right hand to eat) or European style (keeping fork in left hand to eat) eating is acceptable.

6. Soupspoon. Dip the spoon into the soup, moving it away from the body, until it is about two-thirds full, then sip the liquid, without slurping, from the side of the spoon without inserting the whole spoon into the mouth. This prevents soup from being spilled onto your clothes.

16. Never talk with food in your mouth. If asked a question while chewing, simply hold up your index finger to imply "one moment" and then speak after you swallow.

25. Never debate politics, religion or any other sensitive issues while dining.

And at a charity golf tournament, they were apparently auctioned off and made to sit on the winners' laps. They were also made to don bikinis to do backflips and climb into a dunk tank, it is alleged.

In both their personal and cheerleading lives, the women were reportedly subjected to a shocking and 'onerous set of rules dictating how the women could walk, talk, dress, speak and behave'.

The handbook, that reads like it's from an Edwardian finishing school for girls, advises  cheerleaders on how to wash their bodies - including their private parts - and what kind of tampons to use.

It instructs: 'When menstruating, use a product that (sic) right for your menstrual flow... A tampon too big can irritate and develop fungus.  

Angry: Speaking of her decision to leave the squad and never again return,  Alyssa (pictured) said: 'It came down to this: What self-worth do I have?'

'A product left in too long can cause bacteria or fungus build up. Products can be changed at least every 4 hours. Except when sleeping, they can be left in for the night.' 

It details everything about being a Buffalo Jill, from what sort of nail polish is appropriate and how to wear your hair - in well-managed curls, but not ringlets - to how to sip soup at a formal dinner.

Speaking in the officer of her and Alyssa's lawyer, Sean Cooney, Maria, who is an accountant, said she 'busted her butt' to make it on to the Buffalo Jills. When she did, she was 'thrilled', she said. 

But she added that it quickly became apparent that their supervisors would monitor their every move.

In addition to the strict rules, their contractor reportedly ordered them to visit a sponsor who was a plastic surgeon and offered a small discount if they opted for breast augmentation. 

'If you complained, you were told: "This is a privilege. Deal with it!",' Alyssa said.

Speaking to the New York Times, Stejon Productions claimed the cheerleading side was a front operation, saying: 'The Bills control everything, from the moves to the uniforms to the dances.'

Meanwhile, face with a lawsuit, the Bills disbanded the Jills for the 2014 season. 

In an affidavit, National Football League commissioner, Roger Goodell, said he had 'no knowledge' of the Jills' selection, training and pay practices. 

The cheerleaders' civil action, which was filed in state Supreme Court, seeks unspecified back pay and legal fees. No trial date has yet been set. The case continues.

7. ALWAYS shower after a work out and change undergarments.

11. Intimate area's: Never use a deodorant or chemically enhanced product. Simple, non-deodorant soap will help maintain the right PH balance.

12. When menstruating, use a product that right for your menstrual flow. A tampon too big can irritate and develop fungus. A product left in too long can cause bacteria or fungus build up. Products can be changed at least every 4 hours. Except when sleeping, they can be left in for the night.

16. Wash your feet daily ! This will help control foot odor & keep fungus from developing in toenails. Cotton socks also help with odor. Nylons and nylon socks create sweaty feet which creates odor.
