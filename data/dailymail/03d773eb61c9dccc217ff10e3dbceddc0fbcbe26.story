Danish schoolchildren have been pictured watching a wolf being dissected just days after the country sparked controversy by killing a giraffe and feeding it to lions at Copenhagen Zoo.

The youngsters were invited to view the bloody spectacle at the Natural History Museum in Aarhus as part of their winter holiday activities.

Some were pictured holding their noses in disgust as they struggled to cope with the pungent smell.

Spectacle: The museum's Chief of communication Pernille Moelgaard holds up the animal's lungs to demonstrate how they function

The dissection was carried out by the 
museum's Chief of Communication Pernille Moelgaard who at one stage held
 up the animal's lungs to demonstrate how they functioned.

The animal is believed to have come from a nearby wildlife park and it is unclear under what circumstances it died.

While some of the children seemed fascinated by the procedure, others could not stand to watch and turned away or covered their eyes.

Earlier this week two-year-old Giraffe Marius, was shot dead with a bolt gun and fed to lions at Copenhagen Zoo after he was deemed surplus to requirement.

Young children stood at arm’s length as his carcass was skinned and dissected before the meat was thrown to the lions.

The Danish zoo said the drastic move was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational.

But
 animal rights campaigners condemned the killing, 
saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in Europe’s top 
zoos.

Marius’s plight had 
triggered worldwide outpourings of protest, with more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save him.

Shock: The wolf dissection follows the controversial killing of a giraffe at a Copenhagen zoo which was fed to the lions

A British zoo said it would be willing to re home the animal and a 
private buyer who offered 500,000 euros (£410,000) for him.

Copenhagen 
Zoo said it was told by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria 
(EAZA) that Marius was genetically too similar to the other giraffes in 
its breeding programme.

Because captive animals are bred from a limited 
gene pool, zoos are monitored to prevent inbreeding and ensure the 
health of future generations.

Doncaster-based Yorkshire Wildlife Park, whose
 Danish head of ‘hoofstock’ offered to rehome Marius, said it was 
‘saddened’ by the news.

‘We 
have a state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012 with a bachelor herd
 of four male giraffes and the capacity to take an extra male, subject 
to the agreement of the European studbook keeper,’ it said.

However the park said it received no response by the time it learnt that Marius had been destroyed.

Stine
 Jensen, of Denmark’s Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals, 
said the killing showed Copenhagen Zoo was not ‘the  ethical institution
 that it wants to portray itself as being’.
