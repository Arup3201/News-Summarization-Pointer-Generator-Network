Andy Prowting died on Wednesday, eight months after noticing a mole on his back

A man who developed skin cancer after getting sunburnt in Turkey has died - just 18 months after returning from his holiday. 

Andy Prowting noticed a large, brown mole appear on his back six months after the trip to Turkey last July.

Tests found it was cancerous and the 24-year-old from Havant, Hampshire, had the mole removed in April this year.

But in August, he learned the cancer had spread to his bones and liver - leaving him with only around nine months to live.

With no treatment available in the UK, Mr Prowting's family and friends rallied together to create a fundraising group.

They hoped to raise £60,000 to fund potentially life-saving treatment at a clinic in Houston, Texas, and collected £45,000 over a five-week period from August.

But before he could travel to the U.S., Mr Prowting lost his battle, passing away on Wednesday night - just four months after receiving his terminal diagnosis. 

Last night, writing on Andy's Army Facebook page, his mother Julie Williams said: 'This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.

'I am devastated to inform you all of Andy's passing.

'He is free from pain now. I am so heartbroken, he was my life. I will love you forever Andy.'

Friends and family have since paid tribute. Nicola Dolphin wrote: 'RIP Andy. You always had a smile on your face even through the toughest times.'

Karen Fuller added: 'Andy was so strong all throughout his illness and always showed his lovely smile. Heaven has gained one in a million.

'Andy will be missed by many. I will hold all my lovely memories of Andy close too my heart.

'Still hard to believe he's flying high with those angels.'

In September, Andy spoke about his diagnosis. He said: 'I was in Turkey last July and even though I was applying sunscreen every hour, I got burnt,' he said.

'In January I felt something on my back and got my mum to check.

'There was a mole and we kept checking it and noticed it was growing a lot and I went to see my doctor.'

After being referred to a dermatology centre, the security guard was diagnosed with malignant melanoma.

Surgeons removed the mass as well as lymph nodes under his right arm and tissue from his back at Portsmouth's Queen Alexandra Hospital in April as part of an aggressive course of treatment. 

After three months off work to recover, he was referred to Southampton General Hospital, to take part in a chemotherapy trial in August.  

But when doctors ran tests, they found the cancer had spread to Mr Prowting's bones and liver.

As his was a rare secondary form, neither hospital could treat it.

It was then the 24-year-old and his family learned about a clinic in Houston, Texas, which offers treatment to stop the growth and spread of cancer.

It accepted the chance to treat him after reviewing his medical notes.

But the family needed to raise £60,000 for the treatment.

Friends, family and strangers organised fundraising events and took part in sponsored activities to raise more than £45,000.

The money raised will now go to the teenager and young adult cancer unit at Southampton General Hospital in Southampton.

Skin cancer is among the most common forms of the disease in the world, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the UK every year. 

There are different types of skin cancer - non-melanoma and melanoma diseases. 

Melanoma - which Mr Prowting has been afflicted by - is a serious and fast spreading disease. 

Beginning in the skin, it spreads through the body and contaminates inner organs. 

The most common symptom of this form of cancer is a new mole, most frequently appearing on the back, arms and legs, or changes to an existing mole.

These types of moles are often itchy and bleeding and may larger than the norm. 

NHS Choices has devised an ABCDE checklist to distinguish between melanoma moles and ordinary blemishes: 

Applying sunscreen and wearing sensible clothing in the sun is recommended to avoid skin cancer

The more moles a person has on their body, the higher your risk of melanoma.

It doesn't guarantee a person will definitely get melanoma, but it means a person should take greater care in the sun.

The larger a mole, the higher the risk of melanoma. A large mole is one greater than 5mm in diameter.

People with just one unusually shaped or very large mole, have a 60 per cent increased risk of melanoma.

Non-melanoma cancers refer to a group of cancers which slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. 

While not all forms are preventable, it is possible to lower the chance of non-melanoma cancers in a number of ways.

Applying sun screen and dressing sensibly while in the sun is advisable as is avoiding sunbeds or sunlamps which emit UV rays. 

Exposure to UV rays is thought to be one of the biggest triggers for skin cancer, though family history, fair complexion and having lots of moles or freckles also increase a person's chance of developing it.
