Nasa’s Cassini probe has provided some holidays treats from the outer solar system just in time for Christmas.

The bus-sized orbiter has unveiled new images of Saturn and two of its most fascinating moons, Titan and Enceladus, taken earlier this year.

Saturn resembles an ornament in one image, with a jet stream swirling at its north pole along with a hurricane-like storm. 

The globe of Saturn resembles a holiday ornament in a wide-angle image overlooking its north pole, bringing into view the hexagonal jet stream and rapidly spinning polar vortex that reside there

Cassini
 also peered through the hazy atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, 
Titan, revealing hydrocarbon lakes.

Two views of Enceladus are included and highlight the many fissures, fractures and ridges that decorate the icy moon's surface.

Enceladus is a white, glittering snowball of a moon, now famous for the nearly 100 springs, also known as geysers, that are spread across its south polar region and spout tiny icy particles into space.

Most of these particles fall back to the surface as snow. Some small fraction escapes the gravity of Enceladus and makes its way into orbit around Saturn, forming the planet's extensive and diffuse E ring.

A dynamic interplay between Saturn's largest moon, Titan, and its rings is captured in this view from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. Titan's hazy atmosphere and surface environment are believed to be similar in certain respects to the early atmosphere of Earth

Winter is approaching in the southern hemisphere of Saturn and with this cold season has come the familiar blue hue that was present in the northern winter hemisphere at the start of the Cassini mission

Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004.

On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year.

Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer.

Cassini has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the theory of relativity.

Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013.

Because scientists believe these geysers are directly connected to a subsurface, salty, organic-rich, liquid-water reservoir, Enceladus is home to one of the most accessible extraterrestrial habitable zones in the solar system.

Along with Saturn and Enceladus is a group of natural-colour images of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, highlighting two of Titan's most outstanding features.

Peering through the moon's hazy, orange atmosphere, the Cassini narrow-angle camera spots dark, splotchy features in the polar regions of the moon.

These features are the lakes and seas of liquid methane and ethane for which the moon is renowned.

Titan is the only other place in the solar system that we know has stable liquids on its surface, though in Titan's case, the liquids are ethane and methane rather than water.

At Titan's south pole, a swirling high-altitude vortex stands out distinctly against the darkness of the moon's un-illuminated atmosphere.

Using a special spectral filter, the high-resolution camera aboard the Cassini spacecraft was able to peer through the hazy atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan

A still and partially sunlit Enceladus is pictured here. Enceladus is a white, glittering snowball of a moon, now famous for the nearly 100 springs, also known as geysers, that are spread across its south polar region and spout tiny icy particles into space

Titan's hazy atmosphere and surface environment are believed to be similar in certain respects to the early atmosphere of Earth.

But the planet that towers over these moons is a celestial wonder itself. The north and south poles of Saturn are highlighted and appear drastically different from each other, as seen in new natural-color views.

The globe of Saturn resembles a holiday ornament in a wide-angle image overlooking its north pole, bringing into view the hexagonal jet stream and rapidly spinning polar vortex that reside there.

And the planet's south pole, now in winter, looking very different than the springtime north, displays brilliant blue hues, reminiscent of a frosty winter wonderland.

‘Until Cassini arrived at Saturn, we didn't know about the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan, the active drama of Enceladus' jets, and the intricate patterns at Saturn's poles,’ said Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist.

‘Spectacular images like these highlight that Cassini has given us the gift of knowledge, which we have been so excited to share with everyone.’

Launched in 1997, Cassini has explored the Saturn system for more than nine years. Nasa plans to continue the mission through 2017, with the anticipation of much more incredible science and imagery to come.
