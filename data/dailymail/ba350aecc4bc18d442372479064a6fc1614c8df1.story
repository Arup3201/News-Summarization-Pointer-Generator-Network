A 42-year-old woman was allegedly stabbed to death by her estranged husband with a screwdriver while they were visiting a patient at an Illinois hospital.

Francisca Quintero was at the Alexian Brothers Medical Center when Javier Bahena-Arrellano forced her into a hospital bathroom and stabbed her three times, including in the aorta, according to authorities.

Quintero's family heard the attack and Bahena-Arrellano was detained by a hospital security guard before police arrived, prosecutors said.  

Francisca Quintero, 42, was stabbed to death by a family member while they were visiting a patient at the Alexian Brothers Medical Center (pictured) in Elk Grove Village, Illinois on Sunday 

She was rushed to the hospital's emergency room on Sunday morning and pronounced dead on the scene.

Bahena-Arrellano, 43, was immediately arrested and has been charged with first-degree murder. 

Prosecutors said Bahena-Arrellano had read text messages on his estranged wife's cell phone and believed she was cheating on him, according to ABC 7 Chicago.  

Elk Grove Village Deputy Police Chief Chuck Walsh called the attack an isolated 'domestic violence-type incident'. 

Walsh said no one else was injured during the stabbing and that the hospital was not placed on lockdown, the Chicago Tribune reported. 

According to police, Bahena-Arrellano was deported after he was charged with domestic violence battery twice. 

Officials said he returned to the country illegally in 2010.
