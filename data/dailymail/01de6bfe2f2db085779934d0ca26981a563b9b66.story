The latest list of Australia's top 10 tourist destinations has the usual suspects of capital cities and beach side locations but an old mining town in New South Wales has made an unexpected appearance.

Cessnock, about two hours north of Sydney, slipped in at number 10 on TripAdvisor's list ahead of one of Australia's most popular tourist attractions - the Gold Coast in Queensland.

The sleepy town attracts about 30,000 visitors every year with its biggest drawcard being the gateway to the New South Wales' Hunter Valley wine region.

In stark contrast, the Gold Coast pulls in a whopping 12million tourists each year to visit the variety of theme parks and sunny beaches it is so well known for.

However, instead of the list being complied by comparing the number of people who have visited the destinations - the quality and quantity of the reviews on the site were analysed. 

Cessnock, which is the gateway to the Hunter Valley wine region (pictured), was listed number ten in TripAdvisor's top 10 tourist destinations of Australia

Although the Gold Coast pulls 12million people each year for its sunny beaches and theme parks - it didn't make it into the top ten tourist spots

Gold Coast Tourism chief executive Martin Winter said the ranking of reviews was not indicative of the millions of visitors to the Gold Coast every year

It comes as no great surprise that arguably Australia's most famous capital city, Sydney, came in at number one followed by fellow capital cities Melbourne and Brisbane.

Sunny beach spots rated highly with Cairns, Port Douglas, Margaret River and Noosa also listed in the country's top ten holiday destinations. 

Hobart and Adelaide came in at sixth and ninth respectively - leaving just Darwin and Perth the only remaining capital cities not to make into the fave locations.

Evidently the reviewers who jump on the TripAdvisor site to give their opinion of their holiday experiences prefer a relaxed winery tour over the adrenalin-filled fun at amusement parks.

It comes as no surprise that arguably Australia's most famous capital city, Sydney, was ranked number one

Melbourne came runner up for its art, haute boutiques, multicultural dining and the pulsing and swanky nightlife

Brisbane was ranked number three for being the hub of Queensland culture both past and present

The other attractions in Cessnock mentioned on the site aside from the abundant vineyards are 'world-class golf courses, gourmet eateries, lush gardens and blissful spas'.

Gold Coast Tourism chief executive Martin Winter said he was 'absolutely' surprised that the Gold Coast did not make the list.

'We dismiss the illicit comment outright,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It's pretty clear that this is sample is flawed and even though consumers make independent comment that doesn't have anything to do with the overall attractiveness of the destination.

'Our international visitation was 13 per cent last year so we must be doing something right in the minds of most consumers.' 

Cairns made fourth spot for being the perfect city for merry revelers, passionate divers and adrenaline junkies, offering booming nightlife and heart-pounding adventure amid a vibrant and tropical setting

Port Douglas was voted in at number 5 for its perfect base in Northern Queensland for exploring the Great Barrier Reef, the Daintree rainforest and the beaches at Cape Tribulation - or just being pampered at day spas

The lively city of Hobart took out sixth spot for its unique mash-up of the 19th and 21st centuries, the waterfront cafes and restaurants that overlook a harbour bustling with yachts and fishing boats

1. Sydney

2. Melbourne

3. Brisbane

4. Cairns

5. Port Douglas

6. Hobart

7. Margaret River

8. Noosa

9. Adelaide

10. Cessnock 

Mr Winter said Cessnock being included in the top 10 was a perfect example to illustrate his point. 

'Not taking anything away from the beautiful Cessnock but clearly the sample size and the cohort that responds to TripAdvisor is not representative of the millions of people who have wonderful holidays throughout Australia on an annual basis,' he said.

Cessnock mayor Bob Pynsent said the quality of the visit to his hometown made for a positive experience for people.

'When you compare the Gold Coast experience to a vineyard tranquility - whether it be wine tasting, golf, ballooning or just chilling out in the big city - we are attractive,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We hosted Japan for a pre-training camp in the Asia Cup and the number of world class acts across the concert season is another attraction so people go away and say " I love that and I'm going to come back".'

Known as much for its wine region as the idyllic surf spot - Margaret River in Western Australia came seventh

The luxurious town of Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast came in at number eight on the list

South Australia's capital city of Adelaide was ranked number nine for its enchanting treasure trove of shopping, fine arts, gastronomy and outdoor activity

Last but definitely not least - Cessnock which the mayors says is always a positive experience for visitors
