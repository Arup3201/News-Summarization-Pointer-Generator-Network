A Florida judge has rejected requests by George Zimmerman's lawyers to cut his 24-hour GPS monitoring while he is out on bond in the fatal shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.

Judge Debra Nelson denied the bond requests from Zimmerman's defense team on Tuesday.

Zimmerman, who appears to have put on a drastic amount of weight since his arrest in April, faces a murder trial next June in the shooting death of Martin, a black teenager who was unarmed.

Besides dropping the monitoring, the defense wanted the former neighborhood watch volunteer to move outside of the area where he and his wife Shellie are currently in hiding.

Zimmerman, 29, has been confined to 
Seminole County under a $1million bond since July, when a judge 
concluded that he had presented false information about his assets and 
was a flight risk.

The Zimmermans say they are living in hiding and 'in fear of violence,' according to a 
74-page motion filed by defense attorney Mark O'Mara.

O'Mara had said that Zimmerman needed the 
flexibility to travel for his personal safety and to be available to 
assist his lawyers in meetings with witnesses.

Self-defense: Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty, claiming he had acted under Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law

Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the 17-year-old Martin's shooting following an altercation in Sanford in February.

The former neighborhood watch volunteer has pleaded not guilty, claiming self-defense under Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law.

Prosecutors argue that Zimmerman pursued, confronted 
and killed Martin, who was returning with from a nearby 7-Eleven to 
the townhouse where he was staying with his father to watch the NBA 
All-Star Game, with Skittles for his little brother.

Nelson has set a trial date for June 10.

He also set a 'stand your ground' hearing for 45 days before the murder trial where Zimmerman can argue it was self-defense and ask the judge to drop the charge.
