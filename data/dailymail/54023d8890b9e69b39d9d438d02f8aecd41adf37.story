He unleashed a public outcry by inviting controversial dog trainer Cesar Millan onto his daytime TV show.

Now it seems Alan Titchmarsh has landed himself in the doghouse with animal-lover Yasmin le Bon.

The model is ‘on the warpath’ after he said Mr Millan’s unconventional methods were ‘barbaric’, according to her rock star husband.

Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon warned the mild-mannered horticulturalist to be ‘very afraid’, saying Mr Millan is ‘pretty close to holy’ in his household.

The US-based trainer – known as the ‘dog whisperer’ –has a host of celebrity clients including Scarlett Johansson and Oprah Winfrey, although is not known if he has trained Mrs Le Bon’s own pets.

The brunette beauty has a Chihuahua called Tinka, a Pug named Luigi, and Cecil, a Boston Terrier.

In a confrontational interview on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on Wednesday, Mr Millan was criticised for kicking badly behaved dogs and using electric shocks and spiked collars to control them.

Mr Titchmarsh, 63, said the methods were ‘pretty barbaric treatment’ and ‘totally unacceptable’.

But while many animal lovers were furious
at the decision to invite the trainer onto the show in the first place,
Mrs Le Bon instead took issue with Mr Titchmarsh’s aggressive interview
technique.

The 47-year-old model read a report of the interview in yesterday’s Daily Mail. It seems the domestic bliss of the Le Bon household was somewhat disturbed by her subsequent outburst of fury.

Clearly shaken by his wife’s reaction, Mr Le Bon, 53, told his Twitter followers: ‘WTF did Alan Titchmarsh say about Cesar Millan that’s seriously put my wife on the warpath? He should be afraid, very afraid!’

He added: ‘Cesar Millan is pretty close to holy in this house.’

The
interview also divided TV viewers. Hundreds watched a clip of the 
interview on YouTube before entering into a heated debate in the video’s
comments box.

One said: ‘Cesar, you’re a legend. You understand dog psychology better than anyone else I’ve ever seen in my life.’

But others applauded Mr Titchmarsh’s confrontational stance. Another commented: ‘Congratulations Alan on asking these questions - what a shame all Milan did was avoid them!’

Mrs Le Bon, who lives with her husband in south west London, has often spoken of her love of dogs, and has even launched a range of boutique dog-walking accessories.

In the past she has admitted her pets’ manners are far from perfect, although it is not known whether she uses Mr Millan’s methods to improve their behaviour.

She said: ‘We’ve a lazy Pug named Luigi, who often can’t be bothered to get up, and a Chihuahua called Tinka, who thinks she’s a guard dog and tears around after foxes. I’m often the one who ends up going walkies.

‘Luigi chews everything. Him and Simon get on great. In fact, I think the pug wants to become Simon and Simon wants to become the pug. It’s a little bit worrying.’

Mrs Le Bon’s spokesman did not respond to a request for a comment yesterday.
