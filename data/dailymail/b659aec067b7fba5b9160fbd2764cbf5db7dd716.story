Towns and holiday attractions in Cornwall are worried that tourists will stay away this summer after the number of Blue Flag beaches in the country plummeted to just one.

In the sun: Porthmeor Beach, near St Ives, will not be able to boast Blue Flag status this summer

This is a drop of 80 per cent on 2013. 
Last year, five coastal strips in the region flew the prestigious marker
 of quality and cleanliness, and there are fears among those who rely on
 tourism from their income that potential visitors will be put off by 
the news.

Only Carbis Bay – a privately owned beach on the north coast of the Cornish peninsula, near St Ives – will have Blue Flag status this year after Cornwall Council decided not to involve itself in the application process, arguing that it is too costly.

Beaches keen to boast the Blue Flag stamp of approval have to apply each year – and pay for the privilege. It costs £820 for an inspection to deem whether a beach is up to scratch.

A statement from Cornwall Council has defended its stance on the matter.

Pole position: Carbis Bay, which is privately run, will be the only Cornish beach to boast Blue Flag status in 2014

‘Cornwall Council, like other beach owners, has to pay to apply for Blue Flag status,’ it says. ‘Consequently, we will not be applying for the Blue Flag this season on any of the sites that formerly used to have the award – Gyllyngvase, Porthtowan and Polzeath.’

Porthmeor Beach in St Ives was also on the Blue Flag list last year – bringing to four the number of coves which could be deemed to have reduced status in 2014.

Richard Gates, a town centre manager in Falmouth, where Gyllyngvase Beach is among the downgraded quartet, says that the council’s decision is a disappointment.

Not included: Polzeath Beach is a popular spot for families and surfers, and had Blue Flag status last year

‘We think it is very important,’ he told the Cornish Guardian.

‘It is an internationally recognised standard, and a lot of people do take notice.’

He added that Falmouth may take charge of its own application next year to ensure that the standard of its beaches is acknowledged.

Cornwall Council has signed up for a rival award this summer – and is keen to reassure potential visitors that its beaches are as clean as ever.

‘We will be replacing the Blue Flag with a Seaside Award on [the beaches] for the forthcoming season,’ the statement continues.

Good enough for the PM: David and Samantha Cameron took a short break at Polzeath Beach last year

‘It is however important to reassure beach users that we will not be reducing standards of service on any of our beaches and will strive, as always, to keep them clean, safe and healthy.’

In contrast to Cornwall, neighbouring Devon has eight Blue Flag beaches – four of them in Torbay.

The Blue Flag programme runs in over 40 countries across the world.

In the UK, it is administered by Keep Britain Tidy – which argues that the award has worked wonders for the perception of the country’s beaches.

‘Over the years [the programme] has acted as an incentive to many beach managers to improve the quality of the coast,’ the organisation explains. ‘Their hard work has led to a revival of the UK coastline and beaches around the world.’

Some 3500 beaches across the planet, in 41 countries, can claim Blue Flag status.
