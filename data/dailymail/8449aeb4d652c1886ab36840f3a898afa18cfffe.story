Out-of-control motorbike riders have returned to a busy stretch of Manhattan's Washington Heights, blocking drivers and terrifying onlookers just months after a motorist was attacked in front of his wife and child in the same neighborhood.

A video, filmed Sunday by a nervous neighbor and posted on YouTube, shows the group of daredevils blocking a section of Broadway around West 190th Street - some 15 blocks from where Alexian Lien was pulled from his SUV and beaten after a dangerous chase September 29.

The footage shows at least 15 helmeted hooligans on motor cycles and ATVs cutting off vehicles, burning rubber and performing wheelies in front of the R.G. Ortiz Funeral Home.

Wheelies: The reckless rampage happened just months after a motorist was attacked in front of his wife and child in the same stretch of road

'It was crazy, one of the craziest I've seen because it was so flagrant,' Jon-Marc McDonald, who filmed the afternoon incident, told the New York Post.

'They were popping wheelies, burning rubber, flying up and down the street.'

According to McDonald, 37, the maniac bikers belonged to the same gang that caused chaos in September, leading to the vicious attack on an innocent father. He said they pulled the dangerous stunts every weekend until that happened.

'These guys come out on a pretty regular basis about once a week until the beating incident in September. They quit, but then they started coming back again,' McDonald told the Post.

But according to the funeral home, the riders were friends of a man who had passed away and whose service was underway. Spokeswoman Anna Reinoso suggested they may have been putting on the show by way of commemoration, but couldn't confirm, and wasn't sure whether the dead man himself had been a biker.

Bikers: 'They were popping wheelies, burning rubber, flying up and down the street,' a witness said

'They were friends of the deceased, and they just rode around a little bit, maybe five minutes and then they left. There was no problem,' Reinoso told the newspaper.

However, McDonald was doubtful, telling the Post, 'Unless they're having a funeral every week for their friends, I doubt that's it. These guys weren't moving for anyone.'

The annoyed neighbor said the group eventually took off and allowed traffic to resume only when an NYPD cruiser approached. Police told the Post they had no incident report on the crazed activity.

On the video, furious motorists can be heard honking their horns as the gang's reckless road blocking continues. A crowd gathers, including young children, to watch the loud commotion.

Last month, nearly a dozen bikers charged with viciously attacking Lien in front of his terrified wife and toddler in September had their charges reduced because the victim's wounds healed so well.

Hurt:
 Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New 
York as he tried to protect his wife and child. An undercover cop was part of the group that attacked Lien and his family

Ten of the bikers, including off-duty
 undercover NYPD Detective Woj­ciech Brasz­czok, were to have their 
first-degree gang assault and first-degree assault raps lessened to 
attempted gang assault and attempted assault, prosecutors announced in 
Manhattan Supreme Court December 20.

'The victim's
 facial wounds look to be healing in a way which does not constitute 
facial disfigurement under the law,' said Manhattan Assistant District 
Attorney Joshua Stein­glass.

The badly bruised and swollen SUV driver suffered cuts to his head and needed stitches, The Post reported at the time.

The suspects could have faced up to 
25 years on the top charge of gang assault, but will will now face 15 
years if convicted on the lesser charge.

The charges will formally be reduced after Lien’s next medical checkup, Steinglass told the court.

The change does not affect the remaining 11th biker charged, Christopher Cruz, who was only hit with a rap for unlawful imprisonment 
in the second degree.

Alongside: A biker matching Braszczok's description can be seen riding next to the rear of the SUV in YouTube videos of the attack

Involvement: Braszczok appears to get off his bike in a YouTube video of the brutal assault

The biker gang was furious that Lien had run over one of their compatriots and sped after him seeking revenge.

Video
 from one of the bikers shows that the gang had boxed in Lien - who was 
out for a drive with his wife and their daughter to celebrate their 
wedding anniversary.

The angry bikers, including undercover detective, caught up Lien on a busy stretch of Washington Heights and bashed out his window with their helmets.

When
 they were done beating him, some of the thugs tried to attack Rosalyn 
Lien and her two-year-old daughter, who were cowering in the car, 
Steinglass said.

Cruz, who was rear-ended by Lien, was initially charged in misdemeanor court but now faces felony level criminal mischief and up to four years in prison.

Allen Edwards, who told cops he was trying to stop the 
attack, was also included in the indictment. 

He 'was the voice of reason and was the most reasonable, courageous 
person there, to stand up to these people who he's not friends with. He 
doesn't know these bikers', his lawyer said.

Hiding: Braszczok leaves court in New York today with his face hidden after a short hearing into his role in the biker gang assault

Lien was chased up the West Side Highway and was pulled out of his car 
on W. 178th St. as his wife watched in horror with their young child in 
the back seat.

A YouTube video of the 
attack shows a rider fitting Braszczok's description in the main group 
chasing Lien's Range Rover. At no point does he try to stop the pursuit.

At around two minutes he surges from the back and positions himself to the left of the vehicle.

His red bike - which looks like the one in Braszczok's online postings - is later seen right behind the SUV boxing it in.

When
 Lien stops for the first time the man has moved to its driver's side 
and as one biker tries to open the driver's door, he goes to get off his
 bike to assist, but Lien speeds off.

Then he is seen again at the end when Lien is set upon during the second, final confrontation.

The video shows the man believed to be Braszczok apparently pulling up alongside the right of the Range Rover.

His
 lawyers in court on October 9 claimed that he never went within 12ft of the vehicle 
but he is much closer than that as his bike comes to a halt by the rear 
window.

Terror: The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the back

Braszczok's defence 
also claimed in court that the window was already broken - but in the 
video it is still intact when he reaches it.

The
 court was told that he took part in a 'brutal and brazen' attack and 
that while other members of the bike gang hauled Lien out of his car and
 set upon him, Braszczok continued to 'terrorize' his family.

The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break.

He
 then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting
 in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the 
back.

It was revealed that Braszczok worked undercover in the Occupy Wall Street movement for two years.

Braszczok
 - who also told activists his real name was 'Al' - shaved his head into
 a Mohawk and apparently pretended to be a biker bro to win the trust of
 activists. He attended demonstrations and lived like the protestors.
