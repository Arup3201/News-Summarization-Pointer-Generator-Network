Fred Couples has claimed that the entire defeated US Ryder Cup team at Gleneagles has called on him to be their captain on home soil in 2016.

An 11-man ‘taskforce’ was created to find an end to American embarrassment in the competition, with selecting a captain fit for the job foremost on their list of priorities following the post-match mutiny, led by Phil Mickelson, that undermined Tom Watson at Gleneagles.

But it seems the players on that team – which included the likes of Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Zach Johnson and Patrick Reed - have already made up their mind who they want as captain at Hazeltine National in two years time.

Asked how many of the players either sent texts or made phone calls to him after September’s 16½- 11½ defeat, Couples suggested the answer was all of them.

‘When they all got home, they said, “We need you to do this”,’ Couples told Golf World magazine.

Europe have won eight of the last 10 Ryder Cups and Mickelson singled out the only man to have captained America to victory this century, Paul Azinger, as the man whose example needed following to avoid another calamitous loss.

Former Masters champion Couples, 55, seems to be the unanimous choice of the players at Gleneagles, however, following his three successful stints as captain in the Presidents Cup.

Keegan Bradley, another of those vanquished at Gleaneagles, said on a radio show last month: ‘We need him in the team room. Freddie brings out the best in us. So if anybody at the PGA is listening, we need Freddie "Boom Boom".’
