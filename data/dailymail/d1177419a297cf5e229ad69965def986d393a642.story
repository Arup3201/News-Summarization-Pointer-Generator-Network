Every day, Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. 

Barcelona may not have new star signing Luis Suarez available for the new season, but the Catalan giants have another fresh face - Lionel Messi.

Catalan paper Sport have the Argentine star back in pre-season training across their front page, with the headline 'The New Messi.' 

Look who's back: Messi returns to Barcelona with a new military hairstyle and starts double training sessions

While the No 10 caught the eye with a edgy new hairdo, the paper also claim he is undergoing double training sessions in order to get ready for the season ahead.

Barcelona had a training camp at England's St. Georges' Park before their most recent friendly without their star man.

They drew 1-1 against French Ligue 1 side Nice, with veteran midfielder Xavi rescuing a share of the spoils.

Italian Newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport leads on Gonzalo Higuain who has put his World Cup disappointment behind him and is raring to go to challenge Juventus for the Scudetto with Napoli.

The striker questions a move back to spain, to join fellow Argentine Lionel Messi at Barcelona, insisting he wants to win the Serie A title with Napoli to follow in the footsteps of national treasure Diego Maradona.

He told the Italian newspaper: ‘I am sure that we will celebrate in May. But let's not forget the Champions (Juventus) ahead of us ...’

The 26-year-old added: 'Did I want to go to Barcelona? I always told the truth and that is that I wanted to think only of the World Cup and then I would return to Napoli.

'So I kept quiet and I had nothing to fear, because there was nothing to comment about

'Messi said certain things and I can only be flattered by them. I believe that every player would love to play alongside a great champion like him, but that does not mean that I ever wanted to leave.' 

The ex-Real Madrid striker joked: 'But if Messi came to Napoli, that would be great.'

Gazzetta dello Sport has also linked Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic with a move back to his former club Fiorenta, with league champions Juventus also apparently interested.

In the Spanish paper Marca the ‘king of tiki-taka’ Xavi waves goodbye to the national team. The Barcelona midfielder won one World Cup in 2010 and two European titles with the Spanish side in 2008 and 2012.

He told Marca: 'It has been extraordinary, an honour, now I will be just another fan of La Roja.’
