Misconduct hearing: Tamitha Grey, 46, allegedly allowed her 10-year-old son to start an X-ray machine on a schoolgirl in Haverfordwest

A hospital radiographer  let her ten-year-old son start an X-ray on a patient, a disciplinary hearing was told yesterday.

The boy asked Tamitha Grey, 46: ‘Are we ready yet, mum?’

She replied ‘No . . . OK’, and he pushed the button to switch on the machine.

Nicola Jones, the mother of the 15-year-old patient, said: ‘It was an incredible thing to see. I still can’t believe it happened.

‘After I got home I just could not stop thinking about it.’

The boy was then taken away and Mrs Grey performed a second X-ray on the teenage girl, who had a suspected broken wrist.

Mrs Jones, who works as an ultrasound technician at the same hospital, said: ‘It’s a very private environment, and it was a surprise to see him there just totally out  of context.’

She said she did not realise the gravity of the situation until later, adding: ‘At the time, I would have felt uncomfortable that he was there, but my priorities were my own daughter.’

Mrs Grey took her son with her to work at Withybush Hospital  in Pembrokeshire, Wales, when  his after-school rugby match was  cancelled, the hearing in Cardiff was told.

She admitted allowing an unqualified person to initiate the exposure of a patient to  ionising radiation on May 9 last year, and permitting a member of the public to be present at a clinical examination.

But she denied that her fitness to practise had been affected by her actions.

She has already received a final written warning from Hywel Dda Health Board following an earlier internal investigation.

Location: The incident happened at Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire. Mrs Grey has already been given a formal written warning after an internal investigation

The Health and Care Professions 
Council will now decide whether to take further action, which could 
include Mrs Grey being struck off.

Sophie Lister, on behalf of the HCPC, said Mrs Grey’s son was in the X-ray department from 4pm.

Miss
 Lister said: ‘By allowing her child into a clinical area and  letting 
him press the button she breached guidelines.’ Children were allowed to 
stay in the staff room if parents had problems with childcare, she 
added.

Mrs Grey - who worked at the hospital for 10 years - appeared before a fitness to practise hearing of the Health and Care Professions in Cardiff, accused of misconduct.

'By allowing her child into a clinical area and letting him press the button she breached guidelines that indicated only fully-trained practitioners were authorised to carry out X-ray exams'

Sophie Lister, for Health Care Professions Council

She was given a final written warning by Hywel Dda Health Board after an earlier internal investigation.

She then referred herself to the HCPC, who are set to decide whether further punishment is needed during the three-day hearing.

The panel heard from other witnesses who said the mood at the time was relaxed - and that consent was assumed unless parents objected when accompanying minors into exams.

They were also told Mrs Grey’s son had been brought to the clinical area by a line manager. The hearing in Cardiff continues.
