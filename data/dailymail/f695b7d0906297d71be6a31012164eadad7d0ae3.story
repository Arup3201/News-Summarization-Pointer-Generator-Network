Loss: Matt Kocher, 15, drowned after he was overcome by a riptide while in Lake Michigan

A family whose only child drowned at a Christian summer camp last month have suffered yet more anguish after internet trolls mocked the teenager across webpages set up in his memory.

Matthew Kocher, 15, died after he was overcome by a riptide while swimming in Lake Michigan on July 27, leaving his parents, John and Kathleen Kocher heartbroken.

As the couple prepared to bury their son, they received a call from a nephew telling them not to look on the internet - as his memory pages had been defaced by vile trolls.

Family and friends had set up a Facebook memorial page to celebrate the life of the teenager, an honors student and a star football player in his home town of Tinley Park, Illinois.

'LOL u drowned you fail at being a fish,' read one message which was accompanied by a photo of a submerged person's hand breaking through the water, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Another post showed a video featuring a masked dancer saying, 'you're dead' as other photographs of dead people appeared on the screen, a relative told the Tribune.

'I was very angry right away, and then I said, "Well, these are some dirtbags",' Matt's father John said. 'How could they possibly want to do that? How could somebody want to be so evil, so vile?'

Other people from Matt's school, Andrew High School, said they were shocked by the treatment.

'It just really disturbed me that someone would actually make fun of someone else dying,' Emily Berkheimer said.

The page has now been removed and another has been set up; members of the group must now be approved.

It is a place where he is remembered as a bright, kind teenager who loved playing football, basketball and volleyball, and who was about to begin his sophomore year in school.

'If you had to order up a dream child, it was him,' his mother said.

On the new group, friends have shared images of Matt, while others have sent his grieving parents kind messages of support.

The couple told the Tribune that the family's dog, Mya, still goes to the teeanger's bed, waiting for him to come home.

He died after he was caught in a riptide wave while swimming in Lake Michigan in New Buffalo. He had been taking part in a Christian service camp at the time.

When he got into trouble in the water, red flags were flying, warning of riptides and waves up to six feet. In these conditions, swimming is permitted only with extreme caution.

Matt was rescued by lifeguards who began CPR immediately. He was airlifted to University of Chicago Hospital, but he was pronounced dead.

'He was an amazing, gentle giant,' his friend Tyler Tebo said. 'He always had a smile on his face.'

For its part providing a platform for trolling, Facebook said that it gives links for users to report abusive content on every page.

'Sometimes,
 just like in the offline world, people can say or do things that are 
offensive and in extremely poor taste - even in the wake of a terrible 
tragedy,' a statement said. 'When this happens, Facebook users are 
quick to report the offensive content, and we are quick to respond.'
