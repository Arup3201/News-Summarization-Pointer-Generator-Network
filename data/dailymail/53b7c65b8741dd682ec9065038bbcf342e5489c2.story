Starbucks has announced plans to hire at least 10,000 veterans and military spouses over the next five years.

The Seattle-based coffee company is developing a system dedicated to matching the skills of veterans and military spouses with jobs throughout its organization. It has nearly 200,000 employees worldwide.

‘This demographic represents one of the most underutilized talent pools in our country,’ said former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, now a Starbucks director.

The announcement, which comes ahead of the U.S. Veterans Day holiday on November 11, is part of Starbucks' new effort aims to expand and strengthen its existing mentoring program through the Armed Forces Network.

‘This is not only about hiring baristas,’ Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters.

Starbucks is seeking individuals with experience in everything from leading teams to building and managing complex, global supply chains, Schultz said.

As the company expands globally and gets coffee and tea from around the globe, veterans offer international experience and foreign language skills, Gates added.

The company said it is particularly keen on veterans because they offer international experience and foreign language skills and the company is 
expanding globally

‘They bring an understanding of other cultures and they're accustomed to working with diverse and international partners,’ Gates said.

it will have specialized recruiters to match the unique skills of veterans and their spouses with company jobs.

Starbucks, which has about 20,000 locations around the world, also says it will designate five cafes in military communities where a portion of each transaction is donated to Operations GoodJobs and Vested in Vets, non-profits that help veterans re-enter the workforce

There
is a growing trend amongst largest American companies to hire more 
vets, at the same time as the military is beginning a 30 percent force 
reduction over the next four years.

More than a quarter million 
service members will exit the military in 2014. The concern is that many
will have a hard time finding work.

Starbucks are following the likes of Wal-Mart, which earlier this 
year said it planned to hire more 
than 100,000 veterans over the next five years.

Microsoft has investing $1 
million into its Software and Systems Academy which has put 23 vets on 
an intensive, 16-week course. When they finish next month, they’ll all 
get hired by either Microsoft or one of its contractors, earning as much
as $100,000.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, post 9/11 
veterans have an unemployment rate of 10.1 percent. That’s nearly three 
percent higher than the overall unemployment rate for the U.S. and the 
Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America group says it’s even higher.

A 
recent survey of members found 16 percent jobless. And of that group, 45
percent had been out of work for at least a year.

Not only about hiring baristas: Chief Executive Howard Schultz claims that the company has a host of different roles available for vets
