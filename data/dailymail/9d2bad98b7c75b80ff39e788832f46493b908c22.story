The football coaches at three of the nation's service academies earn up to eight times as much as U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. 

Ken Niumatalolo, the head football coach at the Naval Academy, earns a $1.6 million salary, compared to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's $200,000 salary.

By comparison, Air Force Academy coach Troy Calhoun earns $882,000 with a potential bonus of up to $264,000 and Military Academy coach Rich Ellerson makes $600,000 with a potential bonus of up to $350,000.

The coaches' salary information is based on a survey by USA Today, as well as MailOnline's review of the employment contracts belonging to Ellerson and Calhoun. Hagel's salary is public record.

The numbers are in line with the salaries of football coaches at other Division I schools, where the average base is $1.64 million, according to USA Today's survey.

And like their peers, the service academy coaches get more money for wins.

Ellerson gets $150,000 if his team beats the Navy and Air Force teams in the same season, as well as another $100,000 if his team qualifies for a bowl game, according to a copy of his contract reviewed by MailOnline.

Calhoun, on the other hand, gets a bonus
 equal to 5 percent of his annual salary (about $44,000) every time his 
team wins. Winning the national championship would earn Calhoun a 
whopping $264,000, Calhoun's contract says.

Graduating cadets stand in formation at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Active duty officers in the military make between $32,517 and $69,296

The coaches' hefty payments are permitted because unlike Hagel, they are not federal employees.

While all three service institutions receive federal funding, the coaches are paid through separate, privately-funded athletic associations. 

The funding comes from donors, ticket sales and other revenue-generating activities, according to information from each school's athletic association.
