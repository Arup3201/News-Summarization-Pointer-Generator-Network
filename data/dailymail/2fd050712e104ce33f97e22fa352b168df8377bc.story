Athena the cat is back with her family after spending three harrowing days mewing from atop a 60-foot power pole in Las Cruces, New Mexico, as her owners prepared for the worst.

Citing safety concerns, El Paso Electric rarely scales poles to help animals and had initially refused to rescue the female tabby-mix.

So the family considered their options.

Among them, David Eason tells the Las Cruces Sun-News, was shooting his 16-year-old daughter's pet to avoid a slow death from thirst or starvation.

It's about time you got here: Mary Lu Ward of the Las Cruces Animal Control calls to Athena, who had been stuck on the 60-foot pole for three days in horrendous weather conditions

Athena was rescued after the Dona Ana County sheriff's department convinced El Paso Electric to shut off the power line and provide a bucket truck so Animal Control supervisor Lt. Mary Lou Ward could bring the cat down.

Other Animal Control employees were also on hand, along with one vet and two El Paso Electric linemen.

Athena's plight circulated Monday on Facebook, prompting calls to the local Sheriff.

'We figured she was chased up there by coyotes,' said Eason.

Animal Control officers tried calling for help from El Paso Electric on Friday, but were told their personnel were not trained in animal rescue.

When Athena was still there on Monday, the calls became frantic.

'We were going into Day 4,' said Eason.

'I wasnâ€™t going to let her suffer any more.'

Cat owner David Eason holds a much-needed fluid bag as Dr. Patricia Norris, of the Las Cruces Animal Control, administers a hydrating IV to Athena

Power to the pole was cut shortly 
after 2 p.m. Monday.

Ward suited up in protective gear and made her 
ascent to the cat's location.

Dr. Patricia Norris, the full-time vet for the Dona Ana County Sheriff's Office, was waiting with IV fluids.

Besides serious dehydration, the pet appeared to be

She was returned to Eason, who took the cat inside where she could get some rest and recover.

Power to the area was interrupted for about an hour, officials said, but not many were affected.

Home at last: Despite major dehydration, the vet said Athena seemed to be in good health, and her family said they are going to take good care of her
