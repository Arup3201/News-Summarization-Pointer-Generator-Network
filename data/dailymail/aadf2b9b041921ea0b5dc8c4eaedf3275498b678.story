The mother of Daisy Coleman, the teenager who claimed she was raped by a high school football star, has written a powerful essay in which she opens up about her daughter’s suicide attempt.

Melinda Coleman, 52, writes that the media attention her daughter’s case has generated, as well as the internet backlash, ‘has been too much at times’. She also writes that the family has been followed by a private investigator.

In January 2012, Daisy, then aged 14, claimed that Michael Barnett, a 17-year-old Maryville High senior, raped her at a house party. He said the sex was consensual.

Last week, Daisy, pictured with blonde hair, briefly attended a party with a friend and arrived home to a stream of abuse on her Facebook page from two girls who she previously counted as friends

The case received international attention after the relentless bullying eventually forced the Coleman family to move from Maryville to nearby Albany.

Then almost exactly two years after the initial incident, Daisy attempted to commit suicide for the third time after ingesting a mix of cough medicine and prescription drugs. 

Mrs Coleman has now written a moving account of what happened that night, beginning with Daisy walking into her 18-year-old brother Logan’s bedroom to tell him she was seeing ghosts.

 ‘She was doing things like grabbing a glass of water and sticking her phone charger in it and saying the craziest things, making absolutely no sense,’ Mrs Coleman writes on XOJane. ‘It turned out that she had taken half a bottle of Benadryl in combination with some prescription drugs she shouldn't have gotten a hold of and taken them to try to overdose.

‘When they carried her into the back of the ambulance, she started screaming, "I'm falling down a black hole." At the time, she was being carried down the porch.

‘We rushed her to the hospital, crying and praying, and there her stomach was pumped. My life seemed like it was going to be over.’

Mrs Coleman, whose doctor husband died in 2009, says that Daisy was triggered when she went to a party and was subsequently bullied after a picture of her attending appeared online.

‘In the months since our case became the subject of widespread media scrutiny, I have seen the dark side of human nature. In addition to the party that she attended -- which resulted in significant backlash on Facebook, including from some of the friends who she grew up with who my deceased husband cared for -- she was recently almost run off the road, which terrified her, because the attack appeared targeted and deadly.'

She claims that she has seen two Justice for Daisy Coleman pages on Facebook which claim to raise money to help the family but they were actually raising funds for people who were hiring private detectives to follow them.

‘We've been followed by a private investigator almost daily since all of this began. Typically I drove the Hummer, but the one day that she was driving it, she found herself so vigorously followed -- with this other car tapping her bumper and flashing his brights -- the experience left her terrified. Even though I got the license plate number, and I've talked to the highway patrol and the special prosecutor, no one can tell me who it was.

‘The entire experience triggered her in a way that I refuse to let happen again. I will not lose my daughter.’

Mrs Coleman calls on parents to make sure their children are being protected from online abuse.‘Let them know that these people are cowards, and nothing but. Do not let the cowards win. Do not let them take your child's life.’

Mrs Coleman also writes that the family have spoken about plans for the future, and have decided to open up a rehabilitation center for children ‘who have been affected by tragedy and trauma’.

‘Daisy especially wants to help other kids who might be displaced in the foster system, which she was exposed to during one of her outpatient stays,’ she writes.

‘All Daisy wants to do is help other people and to carry on the love and spirit that so many have expressed to us in these past few months.’

Mrs Coleman has vociferously campaigned to get Michael Barnett convicted of the alleged attack on Daisy, in Maryville, Missouri.

The investigation was reopened in October, but earlier this month it was revealed that no sex charges would be brought against Barnett.

Instead, he was convicted of Child Endangerment – for leaving Daisy out in the freezing cold - given two years’ probation in a plea bargain deal and ordered to apologize to the 16-year-old.

In the aftermath of that decision, Mrs Coleman told MailOnline: ‘I’m not finished fighting, not at all, this just makes me even angrier.’

At the time of the attack, back in January 2012, it was alleged one of the other boys present at the party, Jordan Zech, filmed Barnett, now 19, and Daisy having sex.

That video was never found and Melinda is convinced that was also part of the cover up.

The case received national attention after the relentless bullying eventually forced the Coleman’s to flee Maryville to nearby Albany. The family home then mysteriously burned down.
