A yellow-roofed warehouse that featured in a James Bond film has been given listed status.

The Spectrum building, formally the 
Renault Distribution Centre, in Swindon, was designed by Sir Norman 
Foster and features yellow steel 'umbrella masts' and a yellow roof 
around the single-storey glass-walled warehouse.

Built
 in 1980, the building featured as the backdrop to scenes in the 1984 
James Bond film, A View to a Kill. It has been given Grade II* listing.

Bold new heritage: The Spectrum Building, formerly the Renault Distribution Centre in Swindon, sas been given listed status by Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey

Unusual: The Spectrum Building is one of four ultra-modern post-war buildings to received Grade II* listed status this week

A Cold War bunker, a concrete electricity sub-station and a steel-framed private house have also been listed by Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey in the latest move to protect post-war architecture.

The Civil Defence Bunker in Gravesend, Kent, has been given Grade II listing, as a rare surviving example of a purpose built civil defence control centre, which would have been used in the case of a Soviet air attack.

The building, which would have been staffed by around 35 people, would have handled information and co-ordinated the response to a nuclear attack, and was operational between 1954 and 1968.

While a 'brutalist' electricity substation on Moore Street in Sheffield, was an important component of the radical post-war regeneration of the city which was badly bombed, English Heritage said.

The building, designed by Bryan Jefferson, has been listed at Grade II.

Home sweet home: Capel Manor House, in Horsmonden, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, has also been listed

Special status: Capel Manor House is now one of just 5.5 per cent of buildings which have listed in the UK

And Capel Manor House, in Horsmonden, 
near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, which is built with its steel frame exposed,
 bronze tinted glass walls and a flat timber roof, has been listed at 
Grade II*, joining just 5.5 per cent of listed buildings, for its high 
architectural interest.

The building was designed by Michael Manser, one of a small number of architects in the 1960s and 1970s who explored the use of steel-frame construction for domestic architecture.

The Roman Catholic Church of English Martyrs, Birkenhead, the Wirral, built in 1952, was originally listed at Grade II but has seen its listing upgraded to the higher Grade II* listing.

Mr Vaizey said: 'Everyone knows that England has a fine and wonderful built heritage. But it's sometimes forgotten that we have many outstanding modern buildings too.

'Our architects are among the best in the world and it's absolutely right that their finest work is afforded the same protection as their historic forebears.

'The buildings and structures I am listing today demonstrate this well. Innovative, exciting and eye-catching, they each in different ways show that architecture in this country is very much alive and well in the modern world.'

Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, admitted that listing modern buildings, which some people saw as 'concrete monstrosities', could be controversial.

'Few areas of English Heritage's work are as disputed or as intriguing as the listing of modern heritage and these striking buildings listed today exemplify our rigorous and highly selective approach.

'Some still view the buildings of the era as concrete monstrosities, others as fine landmarks in the history of building design,' he said.

The listings coincide with the opening of an English Heritage exhibition, Brutal and Beautiful, looking at the UK's love/hate relationship with recent architectural history, at Wellington Arch, central London, from September 25 to November 24.

Almost 700 post-war buildings have been listed in the past 25 years.

Talking point: The Gravesend Civil Defence Control Centre Bunker in Gravesend, Knet, has been given listed status

Going up in the world: The Roman Catholic Church of English Martyrs, in Birkenhead, the Wirral, built in 1952, has seen its listing upgraded from Grade II to Grade II*

Focus point: The altar of the Roman Catholic Church of English Martyrs is considered one of the 'many outstanding modern buildings'
