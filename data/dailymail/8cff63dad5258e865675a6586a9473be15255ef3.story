A mother who fled jihadi gunmen told yesterday how she had seen militants sever the heads of men in her village and then parade them in front of the victims’ families on the bonnets of captured vehicles.

Her face badly scorched by the sun after days hiding in the mountains, the woman said she had witnessed the Islamic State fighters cut the head of one man just feet from her using a knife.

She said at least five heads had been severed and paraded.

Eyewitness: The Yazidi woman fleeing for her life described seeing horrific things as ISIS invaded her village

Another witness said that the women would be ‘better off dead’ than captured by the militants due to what was being done to them.

The latest horrific account of the barbarism of militant death squads in their sweep through northern Iraq in the last two weeks was one of a catalogue of harrowing stories given by Yazidi survivors, who had escaped the attacks only to find themselves trapped in the Sinjar mountains fearing massacre.

The woman and her family had made it to the safety of Kurdistan after walking from the mountain for 12 hours guided by Kurdish fighters.

Others had an even longer trek to the camps of Turkey.

One survivor spoke of seeing up to 1,000 bodies lying on the mountainside in temperatures approaching 50C. The smell was appalling, he said.

Another told of a pregnant woman being executed and her stomach cut open black-uniformed Islamic State militants.

The anguished journey off Sinjar was made by Mahma Qassem, 28, a father-of-three, who said two members of his family had been killed and one was missing on Sinjar.

‘Many people have died on the mountain, many people are close to dying, they are alive but not living,’ he said.

‘We thought we would be safe in the mountains but it is a different danger there…from starving or dying of thirst as well as from the bullet.

‘Some people, especially the old, are too weak to try to walk so they can try to escape – they will die there either from a bullet or from a shortage of the things that makes life possible.’

He added : ‘People know if they try to escape and take the wrong path then they will be taken and killed if they are men, if they are women or girls, they will be taken…

‘They are doing bad things to women. Some people say it would be better for them to be dead.’

Another Yazidi, Tariq, 33, who had been trapped on Sinjar said : ‘We had nothing. With my own eyes, I saw dogs feeding off bodies.

He said that people had fled the Islamic State only for them to be hunted down by a messenger who gave an ultimatum to convert to Islam by noon the next day or die.

At least 20,000 civilians, most of whom are from the Yazidi community, who had been besieged by jihadists on a mountain in northern Iraq have safely escaped to Syria and been escorted by Kurdish forces back into Iraq

With tens of thousands of others, they walked on to the barren mountainside of Sinjar. He spoke of people dropping down from dehydration and hunger.

His 80 year-old father died two days later from the extreme heat and lack of food or water.

Amer Omar Pajo said he watched his father shot in the head by Islamic State gunmen as they fled to the mountains and his mother later died from dehydration.

The family sold the last of their belongings to pay a smuggler.

One mother, who suffers agonising rheumatism, told how she and her three young children waded through the Tigris River, walked through a minefield and climbed through a barbed-wire fence to make it into Turkey.

At one point in the five-hour walk, her family said, the smuggler wanted her children to leave her behind because she was too slow, but they chose to carry her instead.

Omer and his wife, Baraa, both 60, took nine days to make the trip from their home in Sinjar to a border town in southeast Turkey.

Their 26-year-old daughter, Busra Saeed, said the most harrowing moment of her journey was not when the militants torched her home or the bullets, it was when she crossed the river from Iraq to Turkey.

She had to hold her two-year-old son Waseem above her head to keep him from drowning.

‘I thought I would lose him,’ she said.

Baraa, who survived by eating leaves, said a neighbour had telephoned her days ago to say he had witnessed militants kill a pregnant woman and cut open her tummy.
