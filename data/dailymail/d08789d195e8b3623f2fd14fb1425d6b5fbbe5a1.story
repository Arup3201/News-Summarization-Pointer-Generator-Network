Hall of Fame basketball player Michael Jordan doesn’t think much of LeBron James.

In a video promoting the ‘NBA 2K14’ video game, the Hall of Famer said that he could beat King James in a game of one-on-one when he was in his prime, but thinks Kobe Bryant might prove to be a worthy opponent.

‘I don't think I would lose,’ said the six-time champion, ‘other than to Kobe Bryant, because he steals all of my moves.’

His Airness also named a few players he’d loved to have played one-on-one in their primes: Carmelo Anthony, Elgin Baylor, Julius Erving, Dwayne Wade and Jerry West – in addition to Mr James.

When informed of the former Bull’s comments, Mr James told reporters covering the Miami Heat’s training camp in Nassau, Bahamas, that such a matchup has crossed his mind.

‘MJ said that? I've thought about the matchup, but no one will ever see it and it's not going to happen,’ the defending two-time champion said, adding ‘it's good for people to talk about.’

Sounding like he’s about to yell at Mr James to get off his lawn, Mr Jordan, 50, griped that players are softer than they were in his day.

His Airness: Considered by many to be the greatest player ever, Mr Jordan won six titles during his career, never losing an NBA Finals he appeared in

King James: The four-time league MVP has won the the last two NBA titles, but lost the first two finals he appeared in while with the Cleveland Cavaliers

‘You go in with the understanding of, 'I'm going to get hit. I'm going to pay the price,’ said Mr Jordan.

But that's part of the game. I'm not going to be afraid to go inside. Those are the types of things that these kids don't even have a clue of how we had to grow up and how we had to play.’

Appearing on the cover of the NBA video game for the first time this year, Mr James had the last laugh.

‘Where he'd say this at? Oh, it was for my game? It's good promotion then.’
