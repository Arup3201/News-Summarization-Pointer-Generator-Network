She may have been carrying a handful of shamrocks but the Duchess of Cambridge still ended up with a spot of bad luck yesterday.

Fortunately Prince William was on hand to aid his pregnant wife after she managed to get her 4in stiletto wedged in a drain.

The incident happened at a ceremony to present shamrocks to members of the Irish Guards on St Patrick’s Day.

Having given a sprig to regimental mascot Domhnall, an Irish wolfhound, she stepped back and found her black suede shoe caught.

Unfazed, she grabbed the arm of her husband and with a subtle twist pulled herself free.

The duchess certainly didn’t let the 
matter embarrass her. In fact, she later chatted happily about impending
motherhood and revealed she would like a boy while William was rather 
keen on having a girl.

Contrary to speculation about a future daughter, however, she insisted they did not yet know the sex.

Ceremonial: The Duke of Cambridge wore an insignia aide to campe to the Queen for the first time today

Guardsman Lee Wheeler, 29, who spoke 
to the duchess after the ceremony, said: 'I asked her, 'Do you know if 
it's a girl or a boy?' and she said, 'Not yet'.

'She said, 'I'd like to have a boy 
and William would like a girl'. That’s always the way. I asked her if 
she had any names and she said no.'

Back with a bump: The Duchess wore the same green Emilia Wickstead coat she used for last year's parade

Guardsman Jason Perry, 33, added: 'I 
wished her congratulations and said I hope all is fine and well. She 
said yes, it is. I asked if she was excited to have her first child and 
she said very.'

The couple were at Mons Barracks in 
Aldershot, Hampshire, to greet soldiers from the 1st Battalion Irish 
Guards at their traditional St Patrick’s Day parade.

Honour: The seven-month-old dog was given a sprig of shamrock by the Duchess of Cambridge

Braving driving rain, William, who 
was attending the parade as Colonel of the Regiment, watched his wife 
present traditional sprigs of shamrock to officers and guardsmen, 
including one to himself. The last sprig was given to seven-month-old Domhnall.

Wearing a smart scarlet cape that 
matched the tunics of the soldiers, he was led over to Kate, 30, by his 
handler, Drummer David Steed.

The presentation of sprigs of 
shamrock by a senior female member of the royal family is a century-old 
tradition which was started by Queen Alexandra, the wife of Edward VII, 
in 1901.

The role was famously carried out by the Queen Mother.

Celebration: Prince William wore ceremonial dress, left, while Kate recycled the same coat she wore to last year's event

William, who was wearing the 
ceremonial dress of the Irish Guards, sported for the first time the 
insignia of an Aides-de-Camp to the Queen on his shoulder.

The position – bestowed on him 
yesterday – involves few duties, aside from representing the Queen at 
memorial services or official functions. However, it will be seen as 
symbolic of William’s growing role within the Royal Family.

The Duchess was wearing the same green Emilia Wickstead dress coat she wore to the event last year. She wore a black hat with her hair up, finished off her outfit with black tights and heels.

She was given a posy of flowers by five-year-old Maisie Purcell, daughter of Company Sergeant Major Andy Purcell.

Cheers: Prince William wore sprigs of shamrock on his cap before enjoying a glass of sherry at the regiment hall

Emerald: Kate recycled her appropriate green coat that she wore to last year's event, which she teamed with a black hat, black tights and high heels 

Meet and greet: The Duchess of Cambridge was given bunch of flowers during the visit to the barracks

As she bent down to talk to Maisie and her friend Chloe Rigby, three, the Duchess told them: 'Very nice to meet you.'

After being handed the bunch of white and yellow flowers, she added: 'Very spring-like.'

Afterwards, a bashful Maisie said: 'She said they look pretty.'

Her mother, Suzy Purcell, 32, said: 'She just came over and asked if they'd seen the dog and if we were cold.'
