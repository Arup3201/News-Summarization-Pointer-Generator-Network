Virgin Australia has rejected claims human waste swamped the aisles of a Sydney-bound plane that was forced to return to Los Angeles.

In a statement on Tuesday, the airline said the Boeing 777 returned to LA after two sinks were found to be leaking, but denied claims from at least one passenger that human waste flowed down the aisles.

A spokeswoman for the airline also denied passengers on board were handed face masks and the stench in question came from one of the blocked sink pipes.

One passenger tweeted: 'Finally home from this burnt vomit smelling flight extravaganza'

Virgin Australia airline said the Boeing 777 returned to LA after two sinks were found to be leaking, but denied claims from at least one passenger (pictured) that human waste flowed down the aisles

One angry passenger on flight VA2 posted his disgust on Twitter

Flight VA2 was scheduled to depart LA at 7.55pm, local time, on Monday and landed safely back at the same airport at 4.09am on Tuesday.

The aircraft had been inspected by engineers who tested the water from the sink and found no human waste traces.  It was then cleared to return to service.

All passengers were accommodated overnight in LA, and Virgin Australia said it worked to get them to their destination as soon as possible.

The flight landed in Sydney at 6.47am on Wednesday morning.

News.com.au reported the blockage was caused by a toothpaste cap.

A passenger on the VA2 Virgin flight took to social media to vent his disgust at what had happened on the flight.

'Virgin Airlines toilet explodes on its way from LAX TO MELBOURNE plane turned back and I was on the flight,' he said on his Twitter account. 

'Vomit on VA2 Virgin Australia. Not good Virgin Zero knowledge abt the issue by airline. But the Crew A-MAZING!'

One passenger on VA2 wasn't very impressed with the leak and posted a series of photos and comments on his Twitter account

This passenger said it was the worst travel experience ever, with no communication

A New Zealand passenger posted a letter from the airline on her Facebook page which apologised for the inconvenience, offering customers a travel bank credit

An airline spokesperson said the safety of passengers was never in question

He also posted that it was the worst travel experience ever and that there was no communication.

Lydia Smith, who was on the same flight, posted a photo of herself wearing a face mask and tweeted on Wednesday morning:  'Finally home from this burnt vomit smelling flight extravaganza.'

Another passenger from New Zealand posted a picture of the letter sent to passengers on the flight from Virgin Australia saying: 'this better be a decent travel voucher, I sat in crap for six hours wearing a face mask!'

'Dear guests, please accept our sincere apologies for the disruption you encountered on flight VA2, Los Angeles to Sydney,' said General Manager of Ground Operations Roger Lindeman.

'Unfortunately the aircraft did need to return to Los Angeles due to an issue with plumbing in the fresh water overflow system on board and could not continue with the journey.'

'At no time was health or safety at risk to any persons on board the aircraft.'

'On this occasion we would like to offer you a good will gesture in the form of a travel bank credit or if you prefer, Velocity points to be added to your account,' he said. 

An airline spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday the safety of passengers was never in question.

She added that reports of human waste in the aisles and passengers being handed face masks are incorrect.

'Following an engineering inspection, a small blockage was found in the sink pipe causing water leakage into the aircraft. It is important to note, the sink system operates on a completely separate drainage system to the toilets,' she said.

'The smell would've naturally come from the sink pipe where people wash they hands.'

Another incident in July on a Qantas flight where a leak caused 700 litres of water to flood the cabin

A report on the Qantas flight that sprung a leak found that a cleaning mop had loosened pipes on the A380 flight

It hasn't been the only incident where passengers were forced to endure a leaking malfunction, after a Qantas flight in July, from Los Angeles to Melbourne, leaked 700 litres of water into the cabin.

A report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found that a cleaning mop had loosened pipes on the A380 causing the leak.
