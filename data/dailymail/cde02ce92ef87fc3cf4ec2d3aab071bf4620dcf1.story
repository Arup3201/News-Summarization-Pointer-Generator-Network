Lukasz Fabianski admits Swansea want to make up for a night of Anfield misery when they welcome the Barclays Premier League's most in-form team to the Liberty Stadium on Monday night.

Liverpool have won seven and drawn one of their last eight league games to close the gap on fourth-placed Manchester United and move right back into contention for a Champions League place.

Brendan Rodgers' side also swept Swansea aside 4-1 at Anfield at the end of December and Polish goalkeeper Fabianski says that defeat still hurts at the Welsh club.

Adam Lallana was among the goalscorers as Liverpool beat Swansea 4-1 in December

'It wasn't the best of nights but this is a game you want to play in, a second chance and an opportunity to put that right,' said Fabianski, who was culpable for Liverpool's second goal that evening when his attempted clearance cannoned off Adam Lallana and into the Swansea net.

'We have had a good rest (from the Tottenham match) and this is a good game to bounce back in.

'We have shown with the way we put the defeat to Chelsea to bed by beating Manchester United what we can do at home.

'Liverpool are on a good run and playing well but hopefully we can compete against them and take something from it.'
