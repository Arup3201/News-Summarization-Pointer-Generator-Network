Once the baby has been safely delivered, Prince William’s first call will be to the Queen on an encrypted phone.

At the same time, the Royal couple’s private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton will inform Prime Minister David Cameron and a small number of other highly placed individuals, including the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Back at Buckingham Palace, officials 
will notify the head of each of the 54 Commonwealth countries and the 
First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Queen Elizabeth II will be the first to know about the birth as Prince William will call her on an encrypted phone

Not since Prince William has a royal baby been so keenly anticipated as the world's attention is drawn to the happy couple

For the public, an official notice announcing the birth will be placed in a glass-fronted easel and attached to the gates of the Palace.

Within minutes, depending on the time of day, a 41-gun salute – pictured above – will ring out in Hyde Park. Visitors will then begin turning up at St Mary’s Hospital.

The Middletons are likely to take centre-stage along with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry.

On June 22 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of Buckingham
 Palace announcing the birth, the previous day, of Prince William. The 
same will happen this year with his child

The same easel used when William was born will be display the royal baby announcement

Friends and other relatives will be encouraged to wait to see the baby when it gets home. 

A source said the Queen will wait for the ‘baby to be brought to her’.

And although he or she will one day wear the crown, the baby will start out life wearing just a humble name tag inscribed with the name ‘Baby Cambridge’.
