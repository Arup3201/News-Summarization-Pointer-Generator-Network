A fierce-looking feline whose facial markings left him looking permanently angry has been found a new home after a shelter's appeal to rehome him was shared around the world.

The Persian stray with a face to rival the famous Grumpy Cat meme was saved by rescuers after he was found wandering the streets in North Carolina.

But his scary stare had been frightening potential new owners - leaving staff worried he was too angry to find a new home.

Now, the stray has finally found a new home after New Hanover Sherriff's Office Animal Service Unit issued an appeal for help.

He was taken in by Shaine Poone and her family in Onslow County, who have renamed him Captain Jack, just four days after the advert went out.

But the shelter had to warn them he wasn't suited to sharing an owner with other feline pets as the breed likes to be the only cat in the house.

The shelter said: 'He was exposed to the scent of other cats and started hissing so we are concerned he may need to be the only cat in the house.'

The stray arrived nameless and with such matted fur that the shelter had to shave him.

The shelter's administrator Delisa Derseraux has now said: 'We're so happy he has found a loving home.

'The interest for him was really big, we've been much more successful ever since we started advertising on Facebook.'

The advert for his adoption, which was sent around the world, said: 'This intense fellow is looking to find his forever family!

'We're
 not sure he's really thrilled with us at the moment because when he 
came to us he was really matted so we had to shave off his fur.

'Once his fur grows back, we think he'll be feeling more like the Persian royalty he knows he is!

'This great cat is two years old and was found as a stray. He's got a loving personality.'

The new Angry Cat has been compared to the popular Phoenix-based Grumpy Cat (pictured)

The shelter's Facebook post caused an immediate flurry of internet buzz once the story of the cat was covered by WECT.

He was immediately dubbed the new 
Grumpy Cat - a flattering comparison when you think of how hugely popular the
 Phoenix-based Grumpy Cat has become.

The shelter's Facebook page immediately lit up with comments, many from people eager to adopt.
