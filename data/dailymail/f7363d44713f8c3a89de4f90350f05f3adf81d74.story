It's hard not to think anxiously about last year's bombings as the Boston Marathon approaches next month. To help Bostonians deal with difficult and perhaps unexpected emotions, therapists will be stationed along the sidelines of the marathon route to talk to those who are suffering.

Dr. Chris Carter of Spaulding Rehab Hospital in Boston believes that people may feel uneasy during the festivities.

'They may be feeling a little more on edge. A little more tearful perhaps or a little more irritable and less patient,' he told CBS.

Carter also explains how people may experience negative emotions at the time of the marathon without realizing what they are linked to.

People who did not participate in the race may be overwhelmed even though they did not experience the trauma directly.

Not only is grieving necessary says Carter, so is looking back at how far Boston has come as a community.

'The progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers. In the midst of the horror and all the evil that was there, look at the good thatâ€™s been coming out,' he said.

Carter will be in Hopkinton on Marathon Monday to support the runners raising money for his rehab.

He spoke of the importance of coming together to help one another after the tragic event.

Carter has helped many survivors come to terms with their fear and anger but says it is really the community that must help one another cope with overcoming obstacles.

'The progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers. In the midst of the horror and all the evil that was there, look at the good thatâ€™s been coming out,' he said.

Being, or more appropriately the mantra 'Boston Strong,' doesn't have to do with being happy all the time. All people should expect to feel anxious sometimes, because overcoming adversity makes people stronger and brings them together.

Carter stressed that recovery has very much to do with help from the Boston community at large

Even though last year's crime scene was cleaned away, memories of the tragedy still linger on
