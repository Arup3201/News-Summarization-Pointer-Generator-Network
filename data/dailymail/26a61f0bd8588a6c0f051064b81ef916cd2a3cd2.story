The family of a 17-year-old California girl who was brutally raped and murdered in 1983 have finally found justice, after a man was found guilty this week of the 'cruel and senseless death'.

Christopher Holland, 59, is now facing life in prison without parole and will be sentenced next month for raping, stabbing and strangling San Jose teen Cynthia Munoz over three decades earlier.

The jury spent two days deliberating, before handing down the guilty verdict.

Munoz was found dead in her bedroom insider her home in Campbell. She had just returned home from visiting her quadriplegic boyfriend in the hospital when she was attacked.

Holland and a friend were regular visitors to the home.

However, due to technology at the time, DNA could not link him to the crime, even though proper samples were collected and stored.

Investigators were able to arrest Holland after retrieving DNA samples from his brother, David Leonard Holland, and another brother. 

Y chromosomes are almost always the same among men who have the same father.

In a shock twist, David Holland was also arrested, after his DNA linked him to the 2001 rape of an 81-year-old woman, according to reports.

David Holland was convicted in that case and is now serving out a sentence in state prison, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

Christopher Holland was arrested in 2007.

He was found hiding in the closet of a San Jose apartment.

His trial started in January.

Holland's lawyers tried to argue that he and Munoz had consensual sex, and that a robber must have killed her after he left.

However the prosecution said Munoz was too devoted to her boyfriend to cheat on him, and brought in several women who were former sex partners of Holland to testify.

The women - four total - all said Holland used a knife and choked them during unreported rapes.

The behavior was similar to the injuries and abuse that Munoz had suffered, the court heard.

'Cynthia Munoz's family has waited 31 years to find justice for her cruel and senseless death,'Christopher Walsh, Santa Clara County deputy district attorney, told The Chronicle in a statement.

'Today a jury held Christopher Holland accountable for her murder and (has) hopefully given Cynthia's loved ones some measure of peace.' 

Holland has also been charged with the 1983 rape and murder of another young woman, 21-year-old San Jose resident Tara Marowski, who was found dead four months before Munoz.

Holland is yet to stand trail on those charges. 

He refused to be present in court as the verdict was handed down.

'He's scared to death,' his lawyer Michael Ogul, said, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

'He can't handle being out here.'
