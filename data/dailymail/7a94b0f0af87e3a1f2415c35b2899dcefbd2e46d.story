A record rise in inflation could cost taxpayers billions of pounds through huge increases in payments to pensioners, retired state workers and benefit claimants.

As most workers face meagre wage rises or pay freezes, those on state support can expect their income to soar by 5.2 per cent.

Official figures published yesterday show the consumer price index – a key measure of inflation – rocketed last month from 4.5 per cent to its highest rate since records began.

As the Government uses September’s 
inflation rate to determine the annual increase to benefits and pensions
introduced the following April, this paves the way for huge hikes worth
almost £3.4billion.

Under the established rule, the State
pension – currently worth £102.15 a week for those entitled to the full
amount – would rise by £5.31 a week next year.

However, the Prime Minister’s 
official spokesman yesterday said that al-though the September inflation
figure and April increase were ‘usually’ linked, the ‘actual decision’ 
will not be made until November or December – fuelling fears that 
ministers are looking for a get-out clause.

One possibility is that the State pension will be increased in line with expectations, but benefits will not.

Gross Domestic Product 0.1%

Average earnings up 1.8%

Consumer Price Index 5.2%

Retail Price Index 5.6%

Household expenses up 8.6%

Restaurant and hotel bills up 4.7%

Clothing prices up 4.4%

Communication costs up 0.9%

Unemployment rate 8.1%

But Whitehall sources have cast doubt
on the likelihood of this scenario, as it would hit the most 
vulnerable, such as the disabled. One insider insisted it could not 
happen, adding: ‘There would be uproar.’

Brendan Barber, general secretary of 
the Trades Union Congress, said the possibility of scrapping an April 
rise was ‘very alarming’. The cost of the increase would be an unwelcome
burden to a government already battling to control its chaotic accounts
inherited from Labour.

The respected Institute for Fiscal 
Studies think-tank  put the bill for an across-the-board 5.2 per cent 
rise at around  £3.4billion, according to account- ants KPMG.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The 
Government reconfirmed its policy to change the index used to increase 
many benefits from RPI to CPI in the Budget in March, and the forecasts 
for the public finances are based on this assumption.

Energy companies are the new banks. They are the objects of enormous public mistrust for very simple reasons.

Household bills are soaring at a time when family incomes are under unprecedented pressure, and despite their protests, the Big Six energy firms appear to be making fat profits out of it.

Even relatively well-off people are reeling at the size of their bills, and shivering in a thick sweater rather than risk turning up the heating a notch, says RUTH SUTHERLAND

‘Benefit rates for April in cash 
terms are set in the Social Security Benefits Up-Rating Order, due to be
published in December. This is exactly the same legislative process as 
has been followed in previous years.’

The Office for National Statistics 
had published a grim set of figures, with the retail price index hitting
5.6 per cent, its highest level since 1991.

RPI tends to be higher than CPI, because it includes mortgage interest payments and council tax – variables not included by CPI.

The statistics show that the cost of 
living is rising faster  in Britain than in any other  country in the 
European Union, excluding Estonia.

And in a further blow, a former 
member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee, Andrew 
Sentance, said inflation is likely to rise even higher as the effects of
energy price rises filter through the economy. The ONS already blames 
power giants’ double-digit hikes for the considerable increase in 
inflation.

It said nearly 70 per cent of last 
month’s increase in CPI was due to their increases, which have raised 
the average family’s annual dual fuel bill to a record high of £1,345.

Over the last three years, official 
figures show inflation has jumped by almost 10 per cent – but private 
sector pay has risen by just 4.2 per cent, while the public sector has 
seen increases of 8.3 per cent.

State workers earning more than £21,000 are currently under a pay-freeze.

Many pensioners have been big losers too, due to the crippling effect of high inflation on their fixed incomes.

Yesterday a report from insurance 
firm Standard Life said a 90-year-old man who retired at 60 in 1981 with
a flat-rate pension of £10,000 a year had the ‘purchasing power’ of 
just £3,207 a year today.

His petrol, for example, would now cost about £1.34 a litre, compared with 35p a litre 30 years ago.

Rising life expectancy means that 
retirements last longer than  ever before – but sadly millions do not 
have enough money to enjoy their longer lives.

The director-general of Saga, Dr Ros 
Altmann, yesterday warned that rampant inflation was ‘silently stealing 
older people’s assets’.
