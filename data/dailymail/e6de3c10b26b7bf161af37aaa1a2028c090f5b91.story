A French Open tennis player who was so enraged by an umpire's call that his shot was out decided to take matters into his own hands.

Sergiy Stakhovsky, of Ukraine, used his iPhone to photograph the mark left in the clay by the ball and 'prove' that the ball was in.

The tennis-player set down his racket and briefly became a photographer in his 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 loss to seventh-seeded Richard Gasquet of France in the first round of the Grand Slam tournament yesterday.

Stakhovsky plans to show the picture to the tournament supervisor in hopes of avoiding losing some of his prize money.

'I'm now expecting a fine, actually, so I'm going to go and fight,' Stakhovsky said.

'I believe it was a bad call, it was a bad judgment. After all, we are playing on clay, where you should be clearly able to read the mark, and unfortunately, not all of our referees are able to do so.'

During the first set on Court Suzanne Lenglen, the 101st-ranked Stakhovsky hit a shot that landed right along a line. The ball was ruled out, but Stakhovsky was sure it was in.

He argued with the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, who wouldn't change the decision.

Stakhovsky decided to gather proof for 
his case, getting his phone and walking over to where the spot in 
question was, then leaning over to get a close-up of the red clay.

'It was just spontaneous. It's never thought through,' he said.

'When you see it, you get frustrated, because you saw the ball is nowhere being out and the frustrations comes in.'

Twitter fans said that Hawk-Eye - a computer system used in tennis and cricket to track the ball's trajectory and can be used to aid the adjudication process - was now redundant in comparison to the quick-thinking Ukrainian.

Stakhovsky said he had pulled a similar stunt during the 
clay-court tournament at Munich last month.

'Munich was a very close call which could go both ways, so I didn't really bother going to the supervisor and asking.

'But
this one is in a Grand Slam, so first of all, the fine is actually 
there, possibly, (and) I don't want to get it. So I'll try to explain 
myself. I don't know if it's going to work.'

At a clay event in Rome this month another professional, Viktor Troicki of Serbia, ushered a TV cameraman out onto the court to get video evidence of a ball mark he was sure showed a call was incorrect.

'I saw that,' Stakhovsky said, then offered a critique of the camerawork on that occasion, saying the angle was all wrong: 'They came from the side, so you couldn't see the mark.'

Gasquet, for his part, agreed the call Monday was quite close and said he wasn't bothered a bit by Stakhovsky's antics.

'It's funny. It's not a problem,' Gasquet said. 'He's a funny guy.

'I think he's one of the funniest guys in the draw. For sure, it's not usual to see that, but I can understand he's frustrated.'

The row between player and umpire is the latest in a string of heated arguments in tennis history.

In 1981 John McInroe had a famous outburst after becoming infuriated at an umpire's decision.

After his first-round match at Wimbledon against Tom Gullikson, McEnroe was fined $1,500 and was nearly ejected after rowing with umpire Ted James, swearing at tournament referee Fred Hoyles and shouting 'you cannot be serious' after he disagreed with their call.

In 1995 Jeff Tarango was playing in a third round match in Wimbledon against Alexander Mronz.He became became infuriated with umpire Bruno Rebeuh, who had ruled against him on several occasions.

As the crowd heckled Tarango he told them to 'shut up' which led to Rebeuh giving him a code violation to Tarango, claiming the phrase was an audible obscenity.

Tarango called for Rebeuh to be removed but he was told to play one - to which he responded by accusing Rebeuh of being 'o'ne of the most corrupt officials in the game' - to this Rebeuh gave Tarango another code violation, this time for unsportsmanlike conduct.Â 

Tarango then stormed off the court.
