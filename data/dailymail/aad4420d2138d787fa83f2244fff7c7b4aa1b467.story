Diego Maradona appears to have patched things up with his 24-year-old girlfriend as the pair were spotted strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after he allegedly hit her.

The scruffily-attired ex-footballer was seen walking arm-in-arm with on-off partner Rocio Oliva, with the blonde pictured leaning on his shoulder affectionately. 

Just five months ago, he was labelled a 'psychopath' after video footage emerged which appeared to show him assaulting Ms Oliva.

Forgive and forget: Maradona and his on-off girlfriend Rocio Oliva, 24, were pictured strolling through Vienna on Saturday just months after she filmed him allegedly assaulting her

In the video, Maradona, who captained Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986 before managing the side with less success, can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his Ms Oliva to berate her for using her mobile phone.

Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone?'

She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. 

Following the video's release, the former footballer played down the incident insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands.

Backing royal: Maradona and Miss Oliva were in Vienna to meet Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein (left), who they are backing to become the next president of Fifa

He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there.' 

Two weeks later the couple appeared to be in better spirits as Maradona was filmed serenading Ms Oliva with an impromptu love song in Dubai.

Maradona, whose notorious Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, has been dating Ms Oliva on and off since the beginning of 2013. 

Also with the pair in Vienna on Saturday was Jordanian royal Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, who Maradona is backing to become the next president of Fifa.

He is convinced the Jordanian deserves to win the presidency and says he will not be an 'advocate for corruption', suggesting he does not want current president Sepp Blatter to win another term.
