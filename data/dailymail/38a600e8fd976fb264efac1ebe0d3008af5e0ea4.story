This video shows the shocking moment a pensioner was viciously beaten up by a gang of youths after he got off a bus where they had been taunting him.

Four young men began verbally and physically abusing the 66-year-old because he didn't have any ears as they rode on a 300 bus through Stockport in Greater Manchester on November 13 last year.

The partially deaf pensioner was left with severe injuries to his head, face and body after the gang, thought to be aged between 14 and 16, followed him off the bus and launched into a frenzied attack.

Vicious: The gang verbally abused the pensioner when they noticed he didn't have any ears. They then followed him off the bus, which was travelling through Stockport in Great Manchester, and carried out a violent assault

Assault: Laughing thugs mocked the vulnerable man on the bus before getting off at the same stop and attacking him. CCTV footage shows them repeatedly punching and kicking the man

Police are now hunting the teenagers, who they believe live locally, and have released CCTV footage showing them carrying out the violent assault.

Detective Constable Drew McArdle, of 
Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This is a disgusting attack on a man 
who was alone and vulnerable.

'This crime is all the more spiteful as by looking at him itâ€™s clear he has a disability.

'The
 offenders clearly took enjoyment out of tormenting him - they were 
laughing while physically and verbally abusing him on the bus.'

Brutal: The partially deaf pensioner was left with severe brusing to his head, face and body (pictured) after the gang, thought to be aged between 14 and 16, followed him off the bus and launched into a frenzied attack

The attack took place after the teenagers followed the man off the bus and pushed him to the ground.

The subsequent assault left the pensioner requiring hospital treatment for severe bruising to his head, face and body.

DC McArdle said: 'Despite ongoing efforts
 we have not been able to identify the four people whose images we have 
recovered from the bus and I am now appealing for the public to help me 
establish who they are.'

'I think they live locally and if you recognise someone please get in touch,' he added.

Hunt: Police are now searching for the teenagers, who they believe live in the Stockport area, and have released CCTV footage showing them carrying out the horrific assault

Police are hoping that releasing the shocking footage may play on the conscience of the young men, and one or more of them may come forward. Despite the attack taking place in November, nobody has been arrested

He said: 'I also want to appeal to those directly in the group to come forward and speak to us.

'I would like to think that at least one of these boys may have felt pressured in to going along with what happened and this incident will be playing on their conscience.

'Now is the time to do the right thing and come and talk to us.'
