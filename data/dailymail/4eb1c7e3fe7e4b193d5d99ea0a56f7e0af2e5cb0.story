A teenager ended up on life support just hours after putting a tampon in, having developed the lethal illness toxic shock syndrome.

Jodie Craig, then 16, feared she was having a heart attack when she became so weak she struggled to move, and began to vomit.

Her temperature soared to 47°C as a fever took hold.

She was rushed to hospital where doctors diagnosed toxic shock syndrome, a rare but life-threatening condition.

Jodie Craig was 16 when she was rushed to hospital in Edinburgh suffering toxic shock syndrome, a rare but life-threatening illness caused by the bacteria staphylococcus and streptococcus 

The teenager put a tampon in at around 3pm, but within two hours she felt she was suffering a heart attack as her temperature soared and she struggled to move

Miss Craig's mother Dawn was warned her daughter might die, as doctors put her on life-support in intensive care. For two years she struggled to recover, suffering stress-related alopecia and pneumonia 

It is caused by bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, which normally lives harmlessly on the skin.

But when the infection invades the body's bloodstream it releases poisonous toxins.

Miss Craig, now 20, told MailOnline: 'My temperature soared and my mum was told I might die.

'I was in intensive care for four days and hospital for a further week and a half.

'I had to take 17 different antibiotics a day and was incredibly weak. I can't believe all that happened from a tampon.' 

In the two and a half years that followed, Miss Craig lost 60 per cent of her hair and developed pneumonia. 

But four years on from the near-fatal nightmare in August 2010, she is back on her feet - thanks in part, she said to her love of Irish dancing.

The account manager, said: 'On the day, I put a tampon in at 3pm.

'Soon after, I started feeling ill so mum called the doctors who told me to come in the next day.

'By 5pm I felt awful and went to lie down. I thought I was having a heart attack. I was so weak I couldn't move and started being sick.

The now 20-year-old credits Irish dancing with helping her recover. She said: 'It's been really hard, but I'm just so grateful to be alive'

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but life-threatening bacterial infection.

It is caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

These bacteria normally live harmlessly on the skin, nose or mouth.

But they can invade the body's bloodstream, where they release poisonous toxins.

The toxins damage tissue, including skin and organs, and can disturb many vital organ functions.

TSS is a medical emergency and sufferers must see their GP as soon as possible.

Patients should be referred to hospital immediately.

The signs of TSS include:

Anyone can develop TSS but for reasons that are not fully understood, a significant number of cases are in women who are on their period and using a tampon - particularly those designed to be 'super absorbent'.

TSS can also occurs as a result of an infected boil, insect bite or wound.

If left untreated, TSS can cause shock and organ damage that results in death.

'I couldn't lift my arm up so I pushed my mobile to the floor and hoped mum would hear it.'

Paramedics were called, diagnosed a fever and told her to attend her GP's surgery the following morning.

But when she got there, the doctor sent Miss Craig straight to Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.

'Doctors told mum that I was seriously ill, but they didn't know why,' she said.

'They said I wouldn't make it and told her to call the family to come and say goodbye.'

However as the doctors went to insert a catheter in her, they saw she was wearing a tampon.

Immediately, she was put on a drip  of antibiotics. 

But the illness had a long-lasting impact.

Over the next few months, Miss Craig's hair started falling out and she was diagnosed with stress-related alopecia.

'Doctors told me that in fighting TSS, my body had suffered lots of changes and my hair had been affected,' she said. 

'That was the worst part. I was only 16.'

She also battled pneumonia caused by a weakened immune system.

And when she started back at school, she would collapse due to tiredness.

It was agreed she could do limited time in class and spend most of the time at home. 

Despite this, she was awarded Highers in English and biology.

She also discovered a love of Irish dancing. 

'I had done nothing because I was so weak,' Miss Craig told MailOnline. 

'But my best friend, Robyn, lives opposite a dance teacher and she told me about it. Now I compete in championships.

'It's been really hard, but I'm just so grateful to be alive.'
