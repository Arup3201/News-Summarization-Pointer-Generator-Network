'It
 has been a difficult road to get to where we are now - but everybody 
kept believing, and thanks to the fantastic support from Mercedes-Benz 
we are now leading the way in F1.

Toto Wolff added.

 speed, commitment and focus have all helped to give clear direction and
 to drive the team forward. With his performances in 2014, Nico has 
demonstrated to the outside world what we knew already in the team: that
