Tony Benn’s body could be allowed to lie overnight in a Palace of Westminster chapel, it emerged last night.

The Queen has been asked to approve the unusual tribute following the intervention of Commons Speaker John Bercow.

The only politician to have been accorded the honour was Margaret Thatcher, before her ceremonial funeral last April.

Mr Benn, who died last week aged 88, won more elections than any Labour MP – 16 – and was a Cabinet minister in the 1960s and 1970s.

His family said last night that the idea had come from the office of the Speaker of the House of Commons.

It also has the support of the Lords Speaker, and the request was put to Her Majesty by Black Rod, a senior Parliamentary official.

The former Cabinet minister is one of only two politicians - along with former Tory prime minister Edward Heath - to be awarded the Freedom of the House in recognition of his long years of service.

A book of condolence has been opened for Tony Benn in Parliament and MPs will have the opportunity to pay personal tributes in the Commons tomorrow.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband will be given a chance to pay tribute today.

Mr Benn became MP for Bristol South East in 1950 - however, he was prevented from being an MP when he became the second Viscount Stansgate, after his father's death in 1960.

But he fought to change the law and was the first to renounce his peerage, which was crucial in the creation of the Peerage Act in 1963. He retired from the Commons in 2001.

A spokesman for the Benn family said: ‘At the suggestion of the Speaker and by agreement with the Lords Speaker, Black Rod and the Dean of Westminster Abbey, an approach has been made by Black Rod to the Palace for agreement that Mr Benn’s body rest in the chapel of St Mary’s Undercroft on the night before his funeral.’

If permission is granted, his body would arrive in the chapel on the evening of March 26, before his funeral in St Margaret’s Church opposite Parliament the following day.

A short service would be held after the arrival of Mr Benn’s body in the chapel.

The Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Chaplain to the Speaker, has agreed to watch over his body through the night should permission be granted.

The only other politician granted the honour was Baroness Thatcher last year.
