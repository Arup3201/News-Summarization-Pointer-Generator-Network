Fraudster Ashar Ali Rathore has been paid with taxpayers' money to return to Pakistan

An illegal immigrant and sham marriage
ringleader who left prison early with a huge pay-off has used the money to set
up a new business in his homeland - offering UK passports.

Ashar Ali Rathore, 33, came to the UK with
his wife Nadia Qadri, 34, on student visas then faked marriages to two Polish
people to gain residency.

The fraudster was jailed for conspiring to
breach immigration law, but was then handed £1,500 of taxpayers' money - on condition of leaving Britain and returning to his native country - as part of a
Government scheme for rehabilitating foreign nationals.

He had only served seven months of his
two-year sentence.

Today, it emerged Rathore has
used the money to set up Xpress Solutions - a company providing UK passports, visas and driving licences in Kotli, Pakistan, his home country.

Among its other services, it also bizarrely offers 'any enquiry related to the laws of cricket'.

He is not currently under investigation by the Pakistani authorities.

Jonathan Isaby, political director of the
TaxPayers' Alliance, branded the payout a 'sick golden
goodbye'.

He said: 'When all of us are having to
tighten our belts and watch every penny, pay-offs for fraudsters like Rathore
at British taxpayers' expense are an utter disgrace.

'Ministers must urgently review the
operation of the Facilitated Returns Scheme to ensure that we are not being
taken for a ride.

Rathore's shop, Xpress Solutions, in Kotli, Azad Kashmir, has signs in Urdu saying: 'Immigration Appeals', 'Income Tax', 'Passports & ID Cards', 'Mortgages & Property'...and, bizarrely, 'Any Enquiry Related to the Laws of Cricket'

'At the same time, the British police
should do all they can to assist the local authorities in Azad Kashmir in
establishing the legitimacy of Rathore's new enterprise.

'Taxpayers will be appalled to learn that
£1,500 of their hard-earned money was used to give a convicted prisoner this
sick "golden goodbye" prior to his deportation.' 

Under the Facilitated Returns Scheme, foreign criminals in British jails are being offered £1,500 each in cash if 
they agree to go home part of the way through their sentences.

When they leave, they receive a cash card loaded with £500.

A further £1,000 of British taxpayers’ cash is payable within the first three months of their arrival home.

The card is programmed to work in ATM machines around the world.

The offer is even available to criminals who have served their entire sentence in Britain – at a cost of £45,000 a year.

They will get a cash payment of £750.

In
 opposition, the Tories said the scheme was ‘simply outrageous’. Dominic
 Grieve, then Conservative justice spokesman, said: ‘The lesson is 
clear: under Labour, crime pays and the taxpayer foots the bill.’

Now
 the Coalition says the scheme will save money, because it is cheaper 
than forcibly removing foreign criminals or leaving them in 
jail.

Once the criminals return home they have to make a claim that they 
need cash for rent, private healthcare or help to establish a business 
before they can obtain the £1,000.

Officials have struggled 
for years to deport foreign convicts and more than 11,000 are currently 
taking up space in Britain’s packed jails.

Rathore and Qadri were jailed last March for their faked relationships with the two Poles.

The pair were arrested at their home in
Luton, Bedfordshire, for conspiring to breach immigration law.

Police recovered around £16,300 in cash
and bank receipts showing large amounts of money paid into the accounts of
their fake partners, when the couple were arrested.

Rathore was deported last July and paid as
part of the UK Border Agency Facilitated Returns Scheme for foreign nationals
as an 'incentive for prisoners to co-operate with returning at the earliest
opportunity'.

But he used the payout to set up his new
business in Azad Kashmir, providing UK passports, driving licences and
National Insurance cards to Pakistan nationals.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'The
scheme saves the taxpayer the cost of keeping foreign national prisoners in
prison and denies them the opportunity to re-offend.

'It should be noted that, as part of our
investigation that resulted in Rathore's conviction, more than £16,000 in cash
was seized from his address under the Proceeds of Crime Act. This has
subsequently been returned to the public purse.

'Nadia Qadri voluntarily departed so did
not receive any money under the scheme.

'At the British High Commission in
Islamabad, Pakistan, the UKBA subjects all applications for visas to come to
the UK to the same rigorous checks, which include checks against international
watchlists.

'In addition, all visa applicants are required to give their
biometrics (fingerprints).

'Staff receive forgery and detection
training and there are tough penalties for the submission of false documents
and information.

'Anyone doing so will not only have their
visa application refused, but also face a ban of up to ten years on future visa
applications.'

A video of the launch of Rathore's new
office, which has been removed from YouTube, shows a poster of UK driving licences, passports of various nationalities and
a UK National Insurance Number card.

It also features an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)
logo, which has been used without permission.

Rathore's office has signs in Urdu saying: 'Immigration
Appeals', 'Income Tax', 'Passports & ID Cards', 'Mortgages & Property',
'Registering Power of Attorney', 'Legal Paperwork/Statements', 'National and
International College/University Admissions', 'Any Legal Disputes' and,
bizarrely, 'Any Enquiry Related to the Laws of Cricket'.

Having been alerted to the misuse of its logo by Luton On Sunday newspaper,
the ECB said in a statement: 'He does not have our permission to use either the
Association of Cricket Officials or ECB logos for commercial or business
purposes and we thank Luton On Sunday for bringing this to our attention.

'We will investigate whether the logos are being used improperly.'
