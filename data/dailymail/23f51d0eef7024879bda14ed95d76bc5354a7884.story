Tragedy: A police car is stationed outside a a house in Kansas City, Kansas, where an eight-month-old boy was shot and killed as he watched television in the living room

Police were called to the house on North Early Street at 10:30pm  after a number of bullets were fired as the car passed the address. There were reportedly six children inside at the time. 

The boy's mother, who has not been named, was also hit, but only suffered minor injuries.  

According to Fox 4 News investigators spent several hours combing the area around for evidence, and picked up at least 22 shell casings.

However they are yet to establish how many assailants were in the car at the time and the number of bullets fired in total. 

Authorities are also still trying to determine the motive behind the shootings and do not have any suspects.

Officers do not know whether it was a random act of violence or whether the victim's mother knew her son's killers.

Sgt. Emmett Lockridge with the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department told the station: 'At this point we don’t have any suspect information. 

'We don’t have a vehicle description that we can confirm at this point, so we’re asking the public for any assistance they can give us with solving this.' 

The baby's mother is also in an area hospital but is expected to make a full recovery.
