Aston Villa's appeal to find Fabian Delph's captain's armband proved successful after the midfielder's 'lucky charm' was tracked down on Twitter by the club's masseur.

The stand-in skipper was mobbed by Villa supporters during a pitch invasion following their 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday evening.

Villa masseur Alex Butler appealed for Twitter to help find the armband ahead of their semi-final at Wembley, offering Scott Sinclair's top as a reward for whoever returns it.

Butler's appeal was successful when one supporter proved a 'good sport' and returned the armband

'The armband has been missing for 12 hours now... please share and bring him home #AVFC #returnofthearmband,' Butler tweeted.

And it proved a success when a supporter agreed to return the armband. 

Butler then added on Sunday morning: 'Ok, #AVFC fans the armband is being returned let's all just enjoy our day and thank @Rob___Taylor for being a good sport.'
