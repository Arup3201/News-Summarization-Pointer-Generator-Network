Forget listening to music, a new slow motion video helps you see your favourite tracks by using paint to show how the sound waves move.

Oxford-based SlowMoGuys, also known as Gavin Free and Daniel Gruchy, poured different coloured paints onto a speaker driver cone.

As music is played through the speaker, a video shows the the paint bouncing in time with the vibrations created by the music to give a visual representation of the track.

Speaker driver cones vibrate back and forth to create a change in air pressure, that ultimately creates a sound wave.

When these waves hit a listener's eardrums, it causes the drum itself to move forward and backward in a similar motion.

This causes the person to hear the sound exactly how its being produced.

The cone is moved using an electromagnetic process created by a coil of wire, called the voice coil, at the base of the cone.

Electrical
impulses coming from the amplifier, or amplifiers, move this voice 
coil, which then interacts with a permanent magnet attached to the 
speaker’s cone.

In the video, SlowMoGuys, also known as Gavin Free and Daniel 
Gruchy, turn the speaker of a 1980s Sony cassette player on its side before pouring the paints onto the speaker driver cone.

Music on a cassette tape is then played at full volume through the speakers to highlight which areas of the cone move as the song plays.

For copyright reasons, Free and Gruchy don't play the actual song but replace it with stock audio.

The green paint is showing rising and falling the most because, as Free explains, it is the most watery, while the more viscous orange paint stays still.

During a second test, Gruchy mixes up the various colours so that they each have a similar consistency.

Free then adds a macro lens to a Phantom Flex camera and shoots the paint at 2500fps to capture 'the initial blobs of paint just as they rise to the top and look cool.'

As the speaker cone vibrates and the paint bounces, the colours mix together and form a cream colour.

Oxford-based duo SlowMoGuys put paint on speakers and filmed how the liquid moved as loud music travelled through it. The video was shot at 2500 frames per second using a Phantom Flex camera.
