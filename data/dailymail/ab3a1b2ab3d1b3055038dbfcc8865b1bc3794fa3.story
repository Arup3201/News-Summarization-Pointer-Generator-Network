People living in Blackpool, Manchester and Middlesbrough are twice as likely to die as other parts of the country, a new study revealed today.

Analysis of death rates shows how differences in income, employment and health impact on the life chances in different areas.

A new interactive map shows how mortality rates differ, and how improvements in health mean there have been large falls in some areas including Cambridgeshire, Tamworth and Camden.

In 2012, the average mortality rate in the UK was 538.6 deaths per 100,000 people. The rate was lower in England (523.9), but 567.8 in Wales, 640.1 in Scotland and 567 in Northern Ireland.

The interactive map released by the Office for National Statistics shows how mortality rates have changed across the country from 2001 to 2012

In England, the North East had the highest mortality rate with 592.9 deaths per 100,000 population, while the lowest was in the South East with 482.8 deaths.

The local authority in England with the highest Age-Standardised Mortality Rate was Blackpool (721.0 deaths per 100,000 population) while Christchurch had the lowest (379.6 deaths per 100,000 population).

Among men, the death rate in Blackpool was 879.3 per 100,000, Burnley 841.8 and Manchester 836.5. For women the death rate was highest in Middlesbrough (604.8), followed by Burnley (602.7) and Blaenau Gwent (596.9).

A new map released by the ONS also shows changes in mortality rates in the decade from 2001 to 2012. Mortality rates for men slumped by 40 per cent East Cambridgeshire, 38 per cent in both Tamworth and Camden and 37 per cent in Epsom and Ewell.

For women, Camden saw a 39 per cent fall, Uttlesford was down 35 per cent, Lichfield 33 per cent, Chiltern 32 per cent and Haringey 31 per cent.

The ONS said: ‘Substantial variation in mortality rates between different local areas reflects underlying differences in factors such as income deprivation, socio-economic status and health behaviour (for example smoking and alcohol consumption).’
