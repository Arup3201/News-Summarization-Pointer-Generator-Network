All for himself: John Ridley has denied that he is feuding with director Steve McQueen while new sources have claimed that Ridley refused to share the writing credit with McQueen

Screenwriter John Ridley has denied that he is feuding with 12 Years A Slave director Steve McQueen even though they omitted each other from their Oscars speeches.

When asked if the omission was purposeful, Ridley said: 'Of course not. I had less than two minutes to thank everybody, and I was so caught up in the emotion of the moment when I was onstage,' he told The New York Post at the Vanity Fair afterparty.

Despite Ridley's reassurances, inside sources have confirmed that McQueen is bitter because he asked to share the writing credit for the film and Ridley denied him.

The first public hint of a rift came during the Oscars telecast Sunday night when McQueen remained expressionless when his film won the screenplay award.

Ridley returned the favor by not hugging anyone related to '12 Years' opting instead to cross the aisle and give his former colleague, American Hustle director David O. Russell, a hug.

The Wrap reports that the frostiness between the British director and American screenwriter has been developing for months.

Unidentified sources told The Wrap that McQueen, who was the a producer and the director of the film, asked Ridley to share the writing credit with him as well.

Heading home: McQueen, seen leaving Los Angeles on Monday, reportedly mad that he wasn't given a co-writing credit even though his wife was the one to find the book that the movie was based on

Trouble: McQueen reportedly ordered Ridley and his wife Gayle to sit far removed from the rest of the '12 Years' group at the Baftas and ended up screaming at Gayle while her husband was in the bathroom

Such a request is not unusual in the 
industry, especially since it was his wife who flagged up Solomon 
Northup's book which ended up serving as the basis of the film. On top 
of that, McQueen has been listed as the co-writer on his two other 
feature films.

Ridley 
reportedly denied the request, but that didn't stop McQueen from going 
to the film's production company, Plan B, to urge them to step in on his
 behalf.

Plan B, 
which is led by Brad Pitt, ended up siding with Ridley but they were 
determined to keep everyone quiet about the rift because they thought it
 would ruin the film's chances of winning over Academy voters and taking
 home the Best Picture win.

McQueen
 was apparently the most difficult part of that plan, however, since the
 emotional director made very clear moves to distance himself from 
Ridley.

While '12 Years' cleaned up at awards season, McQueen would very rarely mention Ridley in acceptance speeches.

Bizarre: Rather than smile, McQueen only gave Ridley an unenthusiastic open-palm clap, and it is now rumored that he wanted a credit as a co-writer for the film like he has received in his last two pictures

Stoic: McQueen was effusive when Lupita Nyong'o 
won Best Supporting Actress but showed no such love for Ridley, only 
giving this perfunctory clap as he walked towards the stage

Moving right past: As John Ridley went on stage to collect his screenwriting Oscar, he did not stop and hug anyone related to the film who were all sitting in front of him, including director Steve McQueen (right)

At the Golden Globes, he only mentioned Ridley after another producer reminded him to do so while on stage.

At the Baftas, McQueen mandated that Ridley and his wife be seated away from the rest of the '12 Years' group.

McQueen went on to scream at Ridley's wife Gayle and tried to take her event souvenirs while her husband was in the bathroom.

For his part, Ridley has tried to tone down the rhetoric about their feud, praising the director at Oscar parties.

'Listen, without Steve McQueen I wouldn’t have this Oscar tonight,' he told The Post.

'I owe a lot to the genius of Steve McQueen, and I am forever grateful to have had the chance to work with him.'

McQueen has not spoken about Ridley at
 all, talking instead about his effusive Big Picture speech that ended 
with the director jumping up in the air- while Ridley stood apart from 
the rest of the group towards the back of the stage.

Serious moment: While Ridley thanked the film's producers 'Mr Brad Pitt' and Jeremy Kleiner, he did not mention McQueen at all even though they had been working on the project together since 2008

On the outside: Ridley stood at the back and didn't interact with any of the other members of the film's team during their Best Picture acceptance

Rolling his eyes? Photos show that he was not 
smiling nor enthused at what is widely considered the night's biggest 
award but may have even been making light of the win

Standing apart: Ridley physically removed himself from the group

'It's
 one of those moments in life that might never happen again but you're 
living it, you're there, and it might never happen again so emotions 
just take over,' McQueen told The Mirror.

As Ridley mentioned in his speech, he 
started his Hollywood career by writing for sitcoms including Martin 
Lawrence's eponymous show and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. 

His first film was the poorly-received Sean Penn thriller U Turn that he co-wrote with director Oliver Stone.

What a difference: When they won for Best Picture, however, he was literally jumping for joy

In
 1999, he wrote David O. Russell's film Three Kings, which may explain 
why he went out of his way to hug his former collaborator on Sunday 
night.

He then took a thematic turn, writing the 2002 comedy Undercover Brother.

More recently he co-wrote the World War II film Red Tails and then wrote and directed the Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is 
By My Side which was released at the Toronto Film Festival in September 
and will be on screens more widely this summer.

Ridley has told how he and McQueen started talking about doing a slave-era project together in 2008 and he told IndieWire that it was McQueen's wife who found the Solomon Northup story to use as the baseline.

Distancing himself: McQueen looked as if he was actively trying to avert his eyes so as not to look at Ridley

Clear slight: Rather than hug anyone related to the film, including star Michael Fassbender of mega producer Harvey Weinstein, Ridley went across the aisle and gave American Hustle director David O. Russell a hug

Walking right past: Ridley didn't acknowledge Lupita Nyong'o or producer Brad Pitt, but only giving Pitt a mention during his speech when he was on stage

'Steve said, "I really wanted to tell a 
story about that time and place and the slave era in America but I 
wanted to have a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade 
in slavery, someone who had artistic abilities and who had station but 
found themselves in a different geographical location. Something that 
has scope and scale emotionally,"' according to Ridley.

'Working with Steve was difficult only
 with the geography. He lives in Amsterdam and I live in Los Angeles and
 in that time period "Shame" came together for him and "All Is By My 
Side" came together for me but we both thought that this was something 
worth doing.'

In addition to
 taking home three of the biggest Oscars, 12 Years A Slave also had a 
successful night on Saturday at the Independent Spirit Awards winning 
Best Feature, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Female, and 
Cinematography.

Returning the favor: When McQueen gave a speech as the film won Best Picture, he did not mention Ridley at all either

Mixed reactions: Ridley did not seem happy to 
greet Angelina Jolie, whose partner Brad Pitt produced his film, but was
 much more interested in talking to Sidney Poitier backstage

Ridley was said to have become 
emotional during his speech and even went so far as to mention McQueen 
in his speech at the event, calling the director 'fun'.

Ridley went on to give a shout out to Julie Deply, who was nominated as a co-writer for Before Midnight.

For
 his part, McQueen chose to highlight the talents of Michael Fassbender,
 who has been in every one of his three movies including 12 Years A 
Slave- but showed no such love for Ridley.
