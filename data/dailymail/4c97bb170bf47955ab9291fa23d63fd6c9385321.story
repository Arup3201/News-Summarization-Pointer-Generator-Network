Barack Obama last night made a plea for Scotland to remain in the UK.

In his first intervention in the independence debate, Mr Obama said the US wanted Britain to remain ‘strong, robust, united and effective’.

His comments delighted Downing Street insiders, who dubbed the US president ‘Nobama’.

Barack Obama jumped into British politics today by calling for a 'No' vote in the independence referendum. He also called for Britain to stay in the EU

While Mr Cameron will openly welcome the President's intervention in the Scottish and EU debates, there is likely to be concern in Downing Street that it will reinforce the impression that the political class are out of touch with ordinary Brits

The pair held bilateral security talks on the fringes of the G7 meeting of world leaders in Brussels today. But in a press conference afterwards, Mr Obama upsetting Scottish nationalists and Tory eurosceptics with his praise for the UK and EU

The PM said his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels was designed to keep the country in the EU

Mr Obama's - speaking at a joint press conference during the G7 Summit at the European Council in Brussels today - risked diplomatic anger over his insistence that Britain should stay in the EU

The US President also admitted that he was likely to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at tomorrow's D-Day ceremonies

Standing with David Cameron at a G7 
press conference in Brussels, President Obama made it clear that 
Washington would prefer to see Scots vote No in September, rather than 
face the uncertainty involved in the break-up of one of its closest 
allies.

He said the UK’s 
future was ‘up to the people of Great Britain’ but added: ‘From the 
outside, at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well.

‘And,
 you know, we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of 
the closest allies that we will ever have remains a strong, robust, 
united and effective partner. But ultimately these are decisions that 
are going to be made by the folks there.’

Mr
 Cameron nodded but made no comment as Mr Obama spoke. But a Downing 
Street source welcomed the American leader’s remarks, adding: ‘We 
certainly agree the UK has been strong, robust, united and effective.’

President Obama and Mr Cameron held a bilateral meeting during the G7 Summit at the European Council today. They were joined by US National Security Adviser Susan Rice (front left) and the UK's Kim Darroch (front right)

Mr Cameron met Russian President Vladimir Putin at Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris before they travelled to France ahead of the 70th anniversary D-Day commemorations

The Prime Minister's meeting with Mr Putin came after the G7 leaders met in Brussels after refusing to attend a planned conference in Russia 

Russia's leader did not appear concerned that he had been rebuked by Mr Cameron and US President Barack Obama for his annexation of Crimea

The
 intervention from the US president electrified the No campaign in 
Scotland. Cross-party group Better Together mocked up a famous poster of
 Mr Obama with the word ‘Hope’ replaced by ‘Nope’.

Shadow
 foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘As a global statesman, 
President Obama understands that interdependence is a defining feature 
of our modern world and  that building bridges, not putting  up new 
barriers, is the challenge  of our generation.’

Scottish
 Conservative leader Ruth Davidson described the president’s 
intervention as the ‘most internationally significant to date’.

‘He
 clearly recognises the strong and effective partnership his country has
 with the UK and our many shared achievements through the years,’ she 
said. ‘Scotland walks taller, shouts louder and stands stronger on the 
world stage because we are part of the United Kingdom.’

Willie
 Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said the US president had 
made a ‘significant contribution to our discussion about our future’.

Mr Cameron held private talks after a G7 session dedicated to the global economy and the Ukraine crisis in Brussels today

President
 Obama’s words angered some nationalists, but Scottish National Party 
leader Alex Salmond, who has never met Mr Obama, last night tried to 
play down their significance.

Recycling
 the US leader’s election campaign slogan, Mr Salmond told BBC Radio 
Scotland: ‘So, in summary, I suppose my message to President Obama is 
“yes we can” … An independent Scotland will mean that America has two 
great friends and allies here rather than one.’

The
 strength of President Obama’s comments took Downing Street by surprise 
as it is highly unusual for the US leader to intervene in the domestic 
affairs of a close ally. Former Labour Foreign Office minister Lord 
Malloch-Brown said: ‘Foreign, unsolicited advice is only going to anger 
Scots. I’m surprised that he has stepped in.’

■ Barack
 Obama said yesterday he ‘makes no apologies’ for the controversial 
release of US Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl in a Taliban prisoner swap.

He
 said the soldier’s health was deteriorating and added: ‘We were deeply 
concerned about it. We saw an opportunity and we seized it.’

Scots could treat themselves to fish and chips every day for ten weeks or drink more than 600 cappuccinos a year if they vote ‘no’ to independence, Westminster civil servants claimed yesterday.

The items were among a string of incentives to stay in the Union compiled after the Treasury estimated Scots would be £1,400-a-year better off as part of the UK.

But nationalists branded the Cabinet Office’s list a ‘patronising gimmick’.

Published with pictures of Lego characters on the Scotland Office website, other suggestions included ‘280 hot dogs’ at the Edinburgh Festival, a holiday abroad for two with ‘cash left over for sun cream’ and ‘hugs to celebrate being in the UK’.

Senior Tories were privately dismayed by the gaffe, which is a far cry from David Cameron’s emotional appeal to Scots earlier this year that they would lose ‘something very powerful and precious’ if they leave the UK in the independence referendum on September 18.

The new row over the tone of the No campaign comes amid criticism that the cross-party Better Together group, headed by former chancellor Alistair Darling, has been too negative. 

Attempts to highlight the downsides of ending the 300-year Union seem to have backfired. The Yes campaign, which was at 29 per cent in polls last autumn, has crept up to 40 per cent with just over three months to go before the referendum.

Twitter users slammed the list of items as ‘absurd’ and said ministers were treating Scottish people ‘like imbeciles’.

A spokesman for First Minister Alex Salmond said: ‘This is a new low from the Treasury who should apologise to people across Scotland for this patronising gimmick … they should also say sorry for being caught red-handed trying to cook the books on an independent Scotland’s finances.’

SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie added: ‘This is the kind of patronising attitude to Scotland we have come to expect from the Tory Treasury … The real figures are that £300billion of North Sea tax revenues have flowed from Scotland to the Treasury over the last 40 years … But all we get in return from Westminster is bogus figures and silly nonsense.’
