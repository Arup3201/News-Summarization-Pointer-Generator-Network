These are the shocking injuries suffered by a Chinese teenager after her father used diesel fuel to try and clean a burn on her foot.

Cui Tung, 13, initially scalded her toes while carrying a pan of hot water from the stove to the bath at her home in southern province of Guangdong. 

Her worried father Cui Shen, 43, did not have any medication to hand, but was told by a neighbour that diesel fuel would solve the problem by numbing the pain.

Lucky to be alive: Cui Tung, 13, suffered third-degree burns to 60 per cent of her body after her father tried to use diesel fuel to clean a wound on her foot

Badly burned: Tung scalded her foot while carrying hot water from the stove to her bath, and her father Cui Shen decided to use gasoline on the wound after taking advice from a neighbour

Human fireball: Tung was engulfed in flames after the open fire in her home ignited the diesel fumes, causing her legs to burst into flames which quickly set her clothes alight

Shen said: 'He told me that the oil would soothe the injury and would also cool it as it evaporated.'

But unfortunately the fumes from the diesel were ignited by an open fire in the family kitchen, turning the girl's legs into a fireball which quickly set her clothing alight as well. 

The girl's mother, Cui Wan Jen, was also burned after rushing to try to help put out the flames covering her daughter's legs. 

By the time the flames were extinguished, Tung had burns covering all four of her limbs, and her lower torso. 

Shen took both of them to hospital, where medics revealed his daugher had suffered third-degree burns to 60 per cent of her body. 

Doctor Chi Li said: 'For a while it seemed as if she might not even survive.

Blunder: Father Shen said a neighbour told him the fuel would numb the wound, and cool it as it evaporated

On the brink: Medics in China's southern Guangdong province said it was doubtful that Tung would survive at first, but her condition is now stable

'However she is now on the road to recovery although she will need extensive cosmetic surgery and skin grafts to get any sort of normal appearance in the future. 

'It's going to be at least five months before she can probably even walk again.'

He added: 'The father had taken the fuel from his motorbike. Using diesel fuel to treat a burn is medically completely pointless and indeed, in this case, potentially deadly.'

Shen's wife, who was not named, suffered second-degree burns on her calf, and was able to walk again in a week.

Recovering: Doctors say Tung will now need extensive skin grafts to her body, and it may be five months before she is able to walk again

Hurt: Tung's mother, who was not named, also suffered second-degree burns to her calf as she tried to extinguish the flames covering her daughter's body
