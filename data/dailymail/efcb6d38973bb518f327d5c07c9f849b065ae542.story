A Polish gang who battered a top academic in his home had a flamethrower in their car and may have been planning to torture him, it was reported.

Professor Paul Kohler, 55, suffered horrific injuries when he was beaten in front of his family at his £2million home.

The father-of-four, a university friend of Prince Edward, told the Times he thinks the gang had planned to torture him with a flamethrower, after the weapon was found in the car of one of his attackers.

In an interview with the newspaper, he said: 'What were they planning on doing? It is just very concerning.' 

Prof Kohler,the head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, was brutally beaten when the masked gang burst into his Edwardian home in Wimbledon, South West London.

Prof Kohler was pinned to the floor and his wife tied to a chair with duct tape, as the gang repeatedly screamed: 'where's the money?'  

They were saved by one of their four daughters, Eloise, 24, raised the alarm after barricading herself in her bedroom. 

Images of the law experts bruised and battered face shocked the nation following the attack on August 11.

After the assault Prof Kohler returned to his three-storey home and was said to have spent time laying down in the spots where the beatings had taken place.

'It was about reclaiming the space,' he told the Times. 

Prof Kohler said he still has problems with his left eye and his wife and children remain ‘quite traumatised.'.

The motive for the attack remains unknown but the academic said he remains convinced it is a simple case of mistaken identity.

‘There was no money, I have never got anything for God’s sake. They just didn’t believe it.' 

Officers  arrested Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, and Pawel Honc, 23,at the scene. They were covered in the professors blood.

Ringleader Dawid Tychon, 29, was arrested days later driving a suspected stolen car and Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, was captured a month later.

Honc,  Tomaszewski,Tychon and Pawlowicz admitted aggravated burglary at Kingston Crown Court.

Honc and Tomaszewski, also pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent. 

The gang of career criminals, who all practised bodybuilding and martial arts, will be sentenced in January.
