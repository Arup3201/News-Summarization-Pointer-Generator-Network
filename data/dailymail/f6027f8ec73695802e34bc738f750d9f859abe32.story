Its previous clients include the Duchess of Cambridge, Claudia Schiffer and Tamara Ecclestone.

But now Blue Almonds, one of London’s most exclusive - and expensive - baby stores can boast that it has helped another expectant mother prepare for her imminent arrival: so-called boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham.

The 24-year-old was seen browsing at the shop in South Kensington, south-west London, as she prepares to become a mother for the third time.

According to a Sunday newspaper reporter, she is said to have liked the look of a blue hat and a matching babygro, but been unimpressed by knitted booties and cardigans, saying: 'I’m just chavvy.'

The store – where the Duchess of 
Cambridge and her mother Carole Middleton bought a £295 wicker basket 
for Prince George a few weeks before his birth – is a far cry from her 
usual lifestyle.

When 
Kate, 32, visited in April 2013 with her mother Carole 
Middleton, they spent up to an hour browsing the Moses baskets on sale, 
before purchasing a large white wicker version.

At
 up to £295 for an off the shelf model, their prices are out of reach 
for many new mothers-to-be. Some bespoke versions can cost up to £1,000 
and come with frilled fitted sheets and sun shades.

Blue
 Almonds boasts that it creates ‘magical rooms for children’, and 
previous clients are also said to include singer Lily Allen.

The owner of Blue Almonds, Izabela Minkiewicz, told online magazine Belle About Town last year: ‘I don’t just sell as much as I can, I talk to them about what they want for their nursery.

‘This is an exciting time and a busy time and I don’t want anyone to feel pressured or stressed when they’re in my shop. I like to take my time and make sure the customer is totally happy.’

The shop, which has moved its premises across the street since Kate visited, is based on a road with an average house value of £1.9million. No-one was available for comment at the store today.

Last Wednesday, Miss Cunningham said she smoked a packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted' to discover her new arrival was a boy.

She had been hoping it would be a little girl - and admitted she would not have done that same if the baby had been female, adding: 'I knew it could harm my child but it didn't stop me.’

Her controversial comments came after she said she wanted to pay the NHS back for her breast enlargement operation, not out of a sense of duty but in an attempt to stop people confronting her.

Miss Cunningham, who has sold tickets to watch her give birth to her third child in October for a total of £30,000, insisted the £4,800 operation on her breasts was medically necessary.

But she said that she intended to give the money back to taxpayers, who also footed the £6,000 bill for the taxis that she took on the school run, in an attempt to deflect vitriol from strangers.

Miss Cunningham said her breast operation was needed because she had 'no breast tissue at all'.

And the mother of boys aged six and three said she needed taxis for the school run rather than taking the bus because she feared abuse from strangers.

Miss Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

She courted further publicity when she said she was considering aborting the child she is now pregnant with so that she could take part in the Celebrity Big Brother reality TV show.

Miss Cunningham later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

Eventually Leeds City Council decided to axe the service, which prompted Miss Cunningham to tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’

She said: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.' Initially, she had planned to cash in on the birth of her son by selling DVDs of the event through a pound shop chain.
