Adonis Ortiz has been beating the odds since before his birth, and now thanks to a ground-breaking multi-organ transplant, the Florida miracle toddler has a good chance of leading a normal, healthy life.

Little Adonis, age three, underwent the multivisceral transplant in October at the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Medical Center, receiving a new liver, pancreas, stomach and small and large intestines.

On Tuesday, the smiling toddler, his mother, Aracelis, and his doctors held a press conference to discuss for the first time Adonis’ life-saving surgery and astounding recovery.

Gut-wrenching news: While still in his mother's womb, the boy was diagnosed with a condition in which the intestines protrude through a hole in the abdominal wall

Four months into her pregnancy, Aracelis Ortiz received the devastating news that her unborn baby boy was developing with a birth defect called gastroschisis – a condition in which the intestines protrude through a hole in the abdominal wall, according to a press release from Jackson Health System.

Miss Ortiz, a certified nursing assistant, had a choice to terminate her pregnancy, but decided to deliver the baby anyway.

‘I have strong faith in God. I had no doubt in my mind about having the baby,’ she said.

Adonis Ortiz was welcomed into the world December 7, 2010, in Tampa and underwent his first surgery to repair the birth defect. 

Five days later, doctors discovered the intestines that had formed outside his abdomen were damaged and the intestines inside never fully developed.

According to his doctors, the child had only 28 centimeters of intestines, whereas a normally formed baby has 250.

Two more operations followed, but the infant’s condition only worsened. This past August, the Ortiz family got more bad news when little Adonis was diagnosed with stage 2 liver fibrosis – scarring of the liver.

When word came in October that a transplant match has been found for Adonis, the family rushed him to Holtz Children’s Hospital at the UM/Jackson Memorial Medical Center with just a few hours' notice.

Adonis’ multivisceral transplant made him
 the first child in the world to undergo such a procedure without making
 an opening that connects the colon to the surface of the abdomen, known
 as colostomy.

‘We’ve gone through some ups and down, but I never lost faith,’ his mother said. ‘I’m happy and excited with his progress.’

The smiling baby boy, a budding Yankees fan, is now expected to make a full recovery. His mother hopes to enrol him in a baseball camp in a year.

‘He is really strong,’ said Aracelis Ortiz of her son during Tuesday’s press conference. ‘After all his surgeries, he comes out with a smile. I’m like how do you come out with a smile? They just chopped you up.’

Dr. Rodrigo Vianna, who performed the transplant, said that his 3-year-old patient has a very good chance to have a normal life, Miami Herald reported.

Adonis’ small body bears the scars of his many surgeries, including one that runs from the length of his torso. He is currently being fed through a tube that runs from his upper abdomen to his nose, but doctors are hoping that after a few months of therapy he will begin consuming food the old-fashioned way.

Baby steps: Adonis will remain under medical observation through February to make sure that his body is not rejecting the new organs, and he will have to be taught how to eat on his own and speak

The toddler is expected to remain at the hospital until February, allowing doctors to closely monitor his recovery and be on the lookout for any signs of his body rejecting the new organs.

Aracelis Ortiz expressed her gratitude to the parents who donated their dead children's organs so that her boy would have a second chance, and said that she would love to meet them.
