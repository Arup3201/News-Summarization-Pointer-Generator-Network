Jilted: Police believe Mary Ann Holder shot her sons, ex-lover and relatives before committing suicide

Police investigating a murderous rampage by a jilted lover who shot her former boyfriend and five other people sensationally revealed chilling details last night of the 911 call made by his wife.

Jennifer Lamb, whose husband Randall Lamb, 40, was blasted in the shoulder by Mary Ann Holder after he ended their tryst, admitted to emergency operators that her spouse had been having an affair.

Mrs Lamb, who had reportedly filed a 
restraining order against her love rival in February after alleging that Holder would
call, text and send nude photos of herself to Mr Lamb, told operators: 'I
don't know exactly what happened, but my husband has been shot.

'He’s on
his way... He's getting ready to - umm... he just called me and said he
was on the highway and that he had been shot.

'He was at - I don’t know 
for sure... I think he was at his work.

'And this woman who he had had an
affair with... she was there when he got there and she shot him.'

Holder went on to shoot her sons Robert Dylan Smith 17, and Zachary
Smith, 14, in the head, instantly killing the eldest, before firing at Robert's girlfriend, Makayla Woods, 15, and killing her niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight.

She also injured her her 17-year-old nephew, Richard Suttles during the rampage on Sunday.

And in a final twist to her murder spree, the 36-year-old turned the gun on herself and committed suicide.

‘We’ve
got death. We’ve got drama. We’ve got a situation basically no one 
could ever imagine,’ Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes said yesterday.

He added that it was 'one of the worst 
situations I've seen in my 30 years in law enforcement'.

The
gunwoman left behind two notes taking responsibility for the shootings.

Mr Barnes said she apologised for the pain she caused but also that she felt 'wronged'.

The
tragedy unfolded shortly before 9am on Sunday when Holder met her 
one-time boyfriend Randall Lamb in the parking lot of the Guilford 
Technical Community College Aviation Centre in Greensboro, North Carolina.

They spoke briefly before Holder shot at him multiple times, before a bullet struck him in the shoulder, investigators said. He is in stable condition.

Authorities said Mary Ann Holder shot both of her sons - 17-year-old Robert Smith, left, and 14-year-old Zachary Smith, right - in the head. Robert was killed, while Zachary is clinging to life

Mr Lamb phoned his wife from the car after the violent confrontation - and she then called 911, saying her husband had been shot, prompting deputies to begin a search for Holder.

They went to Holder's one-level brick residence on nearby Cocoa Drive in Pleasant Garden around 9:30am.

Officers were stationed outside her home, but a deputy spotted her car driving down the street about an hour later.

The deputy said he saw a 'puff of 
smoke' in the car and found Holder dead and her son Zachary  shot in the head. He remains in critical condition.

Deputies recovered two handguns inside the vehicle, one in Holder's lap, the sheriff said.

The officers then went into Holder’s home and discovered her son Robert dead.

Inside they found Robert’s
injured girlfriend, Makayla Woods, along with Holder’s niece, Hannaleigh Suttles, eight, and her 17-year-old nephew, 
Richard Suttles.

Holder reportedly had custody of her nephew and niece after their mother died.

Hannaleigh died on Monday of her injuries. The other two remain in critical condition.

Neighbour Joe Scott told WRAL.com: 'It's beyond my imagination that a mother would - good children such as they were - that she would do any harm to precious children.'

Mr Scott's wife Teresa said: Holder's decision to take in her dead sister's children appeared to add to the pressures of what appeared to be a life in turmoil.

'Why would you take them children, keep them children, when your life's rocky, up and down?'

Mrs Scott said Holder began renting the home across the street about four years ago.

Holder's children were kind towards the elderly couple across the road, Mrs Scott added.

They volunteered to help with yard maintenance and enquired about the health of her husband Joe, who has had recent health problems.

In the past, Lamb also appeared to like Holder's children, Mrs Scott said. 'They'd pack up things and go places together,' she said.

But it was also clear the affair between Holder and Lamb had soured, according to Mrs Scott.

Robert Smith posted no-trespassing signs on trees in the front yard this year in response to the rising level of tension between Holder and Lamb, Scott said.

Mr Lamb’s wife also filed an 
alienation of affection claim, which in North Carolina allows someone 
who is cheated on to sue the person their spouse had an affair with.

Investigators were trying to unravel the violent chain of events and understand why Holder took out her rage on the children.

Holder left notes taking responsibility for the shootings and apologizing for the pain she was causing, Sheriff Barnes said.

The notes also indicate Holder was angry about how her relationship with Lamb came to an end.

The deadly shooting spree, in which two were left dead and four injured, started in the car park of the Guilford Technical Community College

Sheriff Barnes said: 'They were obviously shot for the 
purpose of killing them.

'You can call it an execution, you can call it a
shooting, you can call it whatever you want. The result is the same. We may never know exactly what her thoughts were and why'

Authorities yesterday said they were still 
trying to determine when the victims in Holder’s home were shot and 
whether it happened before or after she met with Lamb.

Sheriff Barnes said there were restraining orders filed, which had expired.
