Fraser Forster will hold talks with Southampton after Celtic accepted an offer worth £10million for the goalkeeper.

The 26-year-old, who will be offered a four year contract, has been one of Southampton manager Ronald Koeman’s primary transfer targets this summer as he attempts to rebuild his squad after a raft of departures from the south coast club.

Forster earned a place in England’s World Cup squad after impressing Roy Hodgson with a string of superb performances in the Champions League for Celtic.

Capped twice by his country, Forster was the only player not to feature as England failed to progress beyond the group stage in Brazil.

In February this year Forster set a new Scottish league record for consecutive shut-outs, passing former Aberdeen goalkeeper Bobby Clark’s achievement from 1971, by going 13 matches and 1,256 minutes without losing a goal.

Celtic signed the 6ft 7in keeper on a four-year deal from Newcastle for £2m in 2012, following two seasons on loan in Glasgow, and it is understood his former club will be due a percentage of any sell-on fee.
