A teenager suffers from a condition that she says makes her look like she is nine months pregnant every time she eats.

Rachael Harley has a problem with her digestive system which means her stomach swells and leaves her in tremendous pain.

The 19-year-old was diagnosed with abdominal adhesions - bands of fibrous tissue between her organs - earlier this year.

Rachael Harley, 19, has a problem with her digestive system which means she says she looks nine months pregnant every time she eats

Every time she eats her stomach balloons so much that people think she is pregnant.

She has now been in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary since October and doctors don't know what to do to treat her problem.

Rachael, of Balmedie, said: ‘My weight's gone up and down in a very small space of time.

‘I put on weight after surgery, but it did get down to six stone at one point because I couldn't eat.

‘My mum couldn't bring herself to look at me. I was just bones.

‘But every time I do eat, I look about nine months pregnant. Somebody in the hospital canteen actually asked me how far along I was.

‘I didn't even know what to say. I 
felt so awful that I lied. It's horrible. It feels as though my stomach 
is about to stretch open.’

Rachael's problems began when her stomach suddenly swelled overnight and she was rushed to hospital on April 28.

She had various tests and scans but doctors could not determine what was wrong.

The teenager was released from hospital a few days later after she seemed to get better.

But the crippling pain and swelling came back and she was readmitted later in the week.

After a range of tests could not show what was wrong, an investigative operation in July finally revealed Rachael was suffering from adhesions, bands of fibrous tissue, on her bowel and appendix.

They were removed and Rachael, who worked as a supervisor at clothes shop Warehouse before she became ill, returned home. But her symptoms soon began to resurface.

She said: ‘Originally the adhesions were intertwined and were cut out.

‘They were causing an obstruction in my bowel and my organs were struggling to move about.

‘Everything was just fantastic and I started eating again. I went home and was looking forward to returning to my course.

‘But it didn't last long and I never got back to anything. I was put on different medications and even tried nerve-blocking injections, but nothing seemed to help.

‘Then eventually about eight weeks ago, I was taken back into hospital.’

Doctors have been at a loss with what to do, fearing that more investigative surgery could make her problems worse.

Rachael said: 'Every time I do eat, I look about nine months pregnant. Somebody in the hospital canteen actually asked me how far along I was'

Due to the seriousness of her condition, Rachael has now been in hospital since October, but she vows to remain positive.

She
said: ‘Unfortunately, now a little down the line we are back to square 
one. We believe that the adhesions have returned and are day by day 
possibly causing damage to my bowel, stomach, gallbladder and fertility 
organs.

‘I am unable to eat much and am deteriorating again. We are losing faith in the NHS doctors and in the care that I am receiving here in ARI.

‘You have to keep your spirits up, but it's difficult. I've managed with my mum to get into town in a wheelchair a few times.

‘I go clothes shopping, even though I can't wear them because my stomach swells so much.’

Rachael had to leave her photography course at Aberdeen College because she has missed classes through her illness.

Rachael had surgery to remove the fibrous bands in her stomach but they soon returned and they are now threatening her reproductive organs - she fears she may have to have a hysterectomy

And she also had to turn down a place at London Metropolitan University to study fashion buying.

But
she is now trying to raise money for specialist treatment which she 
hopes will give her back her life – and she wants to train to be a 
midwife.

She said: ‘I've missed out on so much. I see photos on Facebook of all of my friends out enjoying themselves. It's heart-breaking.

‘After being in hospital now though, I want to be a midwife. I don't want to waste time.

‘Getting the right treatment would give everything back to me and my family. It would be brilliant. I want to start 2014 afresh.’

Rachael is hoping to raise enough money to pay for treatment from a private adhesions specialist in London, who would have the expert knowledge to investigate.

Surgeons in Aberdeen have run out of options for treating Rachael - they fear if they perform another operation it will make the problem worse

Generous friends and family rallied round and have already raised almost £2,000 in just two days.

Rachael said: ‘I can't believe how supportive everyone has been, especially in December.

‘It was a last chance thing and it's given me so much hope.’

If the tissues inside the body become injured, the immune system triggers a response that involves forming bands of scar tissue, called adhesions.

This usually occurs after surgery.

Most of the time, the adhesions don't cause any problems.

However, sometimes the scar tissue can cause the bowels to stick together.

This can cause it to become partially blocked - this causes pain and vomiting.

Adhesions can also pull the fallopian tubes out of place causing infertility.

Causes of adhesions include appendicitis, endometriosis, an infection and STIs.

The main forms of treatment are surgery and painkillers.

In London, a barrier mechanism would 
be inserted to help prevent the adhesions from returning and hopefully 
allow Rachael to carry on with a pain-free life.

The
teenager believes that the adhesions formed and attached themselves to 
her bowel and appendix after she suffered from appendicitis.

They normally develop in patients after they have had surgery, but doctors believe that Rachael was born with the condition.

She said: ‘My stomach doesn't empty fast enough so it just swells up. I can eat little things like snacks but when it's really bad I can barely even take in water because I just feel sick.

‘Other people I have spoken to [with the condition] are having to get hysterectomies because the adhesions have spread so much.

‘The pelvic pain I have is really severe and we're worried about mine.

‘We found out online that when you have them congenitally that there's 93 per cent chance of them coming back.’

Rachael now wants to raise as much money as she can in the hope that she can travel down to London for the surgery next year.

The cost of the surgery and all the tests involved will be about £4,000.
