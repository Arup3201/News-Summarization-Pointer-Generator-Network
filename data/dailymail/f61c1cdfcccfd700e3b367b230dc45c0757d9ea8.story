Sam Allardyce insists he is not bothered that he is yet to be offered a new contract by West Ham, despite his current deal running out at the end of the season.

West Ham have had their best start to the Barclays Premier League since Allardyce brought them back up two years ago and are fourth in the table.

Allardyce and the club left it late to conclude negotiations in 2013, with the 60-year-old waiting until they were safe from relegation that year before signing an extension even though he was out of contract that summer.

With just two games remaining – and their survival secured – he agreed to a new two-year extension in May, but that will have run its course by the end of this campaign.

Allardyce said: 'The conversations are the same as what they were in the first year in the Premier League. 

'We'll see how the season progresses, when the time is right. If it has progressed to a certain level that they want to offer a new contract, that's fine.

'At my age it doesn't particularly worry me a great deal. Contracts are made and broken in the entire football industry. It doesn't mean anything like it used to. A long or short contract doesn't protect you.

'It's a winning culture you need, if you continue to win you improve the club. It's a slow process you have to go through, you build something that's sustainable. It looks like in year four we are doing that.

'We've grown the squad into what looks more sustainable. Only way to do that is to get results. Eleven managers left jobs out of 20 last year. The industry is impatient. Only way to stop that is with results.'

Allardyce said that at his age he is unconcerned by contracts as they are so often broken in football
