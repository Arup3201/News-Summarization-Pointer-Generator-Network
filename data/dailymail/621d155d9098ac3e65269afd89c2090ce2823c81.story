A married nurse called a patient ‘yummy’ and ‘very sexy’ in a barrage of texts.

Sarah Bailey sent hundreds of messages to the diabetic man after treating him at the GP practice where she worked.

They jokingly used a saucy phrase to refer to the man’s testosterone treatment during the frantic text exchange over Christmas 2012.

Sarah Bailey sent hundreds of messages to the diabetic patient after treating him at the Waterfield Practice in Bracknell, Berkshire, where she worked

But Bailey got cold feet when she realised she might lose her job at the Waterfield Practice in Bracknell, Berkshire, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told.

She used company policy of staying in touch with new patients as an excuse to text the man, known as Patient A, in December 2012.

She first texted the man after he had been told off by another nurse about his refusal to tackle his unhealthy lifestyle.

The text read: ‘Hope you are not feeling too down after ticking off. Enjoy your Christmas and I’ll see you when you’re back.’

Patient A replied and invited Bailey to dinner. Over the next few days they exchanged hundreds of text messages.

Bailey said she was ‘thinking’ of the patient, adding: ‘Not sure how to respond to these advances, I have decided to do the ironing to keep my mind neutral.’

Others read: ‘Even though you are yummy we are going to have to be discreet, I’ve never crossed professional boundaries before.

‘You are gorgeous and very sexy, but I’m married and have a good career and could get struck off if you tell anyone we’re having an affair.’

Bailey visited the man’s home on January 2, 2013, to try to put an end to the texting, as she feared he was growing an ‘attachment’. She also feared losing her job and marriage. But she continued to text the patient after he expressed disappointment at her change of heart.

He later revealed the texts to a member of staff at Waterfield and an investigation was launched.

Bailey told the panel in Central London she was deeply remorseful for her actions. She said she was aware that she ‘hurt’ Patient A.

Handing Bailey a three-year caution, NMC panel chairman Elizabeth Burnley said: ‘The panel concluded your behaviour was unacceptable and would be seen as deplorable by other members of the profession and the public.

‘Patient A was a vulnerable patient who had been recently prescribed with a new medication which he was not managing very well…The panel considered that by sending text messages of an explicit and sexual nature, however much this may or may not have been encouraged by Patient A, your actions fell well below the standards expected of a registered nurse.’

She added the panel was ‘impressed by the steps you have personally undertaken to remediate your behaviour’.

Bailey was dismissed from the Waterfield Practice following a disciplinary hearing in early 2013.

She admitted sending Patient A inappropriate, sexually motivated text messages.
