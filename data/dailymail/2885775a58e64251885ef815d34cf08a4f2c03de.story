Gay boxer Orlando Cruz has failed in his bid to become the first openly-gay world champion as he lost to Mexican Orlando Salido in Las Vegas last night.

But the Puerto Rican powerhouse - who last year became the first active boxer to ever come out and earned his shot at the vacant WBO featherweight title with two subsequent victories - left the ring with more support than ever.

Despite entering the match to a mixture of both boos and applause, Cruz - who plans to marry his long term partner, José Manuel, later this year - showed he has the fearlessness and stamina that's needed to be a world-class fighter.

And ofcourse he kept to his word by wearing shorts made out of rainbow colours that were fashioned to resemble both LGBT rights and the Puerto Rican flag.

Despite getting gunned down in the seventh round by now-three-time champion Salido, Cruz said he was happy with how he held his own until the end.

'I went into the corner and (Salido) hit me with a good shot,' Cruz said after the fight.

'I thought the fight was close up until then.'

There was also a lot leading up to that moment for Cruz.

The 32-year-old has struggled with his sexuality since competing in the 2000 Olympics, which is where talk of his sexuality first surfaced.

I was not happy with my life. I would feel a lot of pressure, and inside, I felt weighed down. I cried at night hoping the pain would go away,' he told CSN.

He eventually told his parents he was gay but, although his mother accepted him his father became distant.

As the 126lb boxer's career began to turn professional, suspicions about his sexuality circulated. He recalled how a crowd turned hostile and verbally abused him in 2008, and said he denied he was gay to his own promoter, Oscar De La Hoya.

[Oscar] once asked me quite openly before a fight, "Orlando, tell me, are you going to tell people that you are gay?’",' Cruz said.

'There were other people standing around us, too. Boxers. Managers. I was shocked and said, "No, I'm a man".'

Cruz could only hide for so long and, with the help of a therapist and his new promoter Tuto Zabala, the 32-year-old finally had the courage to tell the world he was gay in October last year.

Last night's match was the first title fight for Cruz in a 13-year professional career.

It's the most important fight of my life. I'm a gay man, but I'm also a boxer,' he told the Guardian.

'My two worlds have come together and I will fight with all my heart. The world knows the truth about me as a man. Now the world will see the truth about me as a fighter. I'm ready. This is my time.'
