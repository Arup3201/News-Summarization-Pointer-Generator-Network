The footage shows Scott crouched the moment he began to jump, reports TMZ.com.

His death was also recorded by a surveillance camera from a local business.

Tributes to Scott from Hollywood heavyweights continued to pour in today.

Tom Cruise praised him as a 'creative visionary'.

Scott,
the younger brother of fellow director Ridley, was perhaps 
best known for the action-packed Hollywood blockbuster Top Gun and Days 
Of Thunder, which both starred Cruise.

Cruise, who became a major star in 1986 after being cast in the lead in Top Gun, said he 'will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.

'My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time.'

Denzel Washington, frequently the 
leading man in Scott's films including Crimson Tide and The Taking Of 
Pelham 123, said: 'Tony Scott was a great director, a genuine friend and
it is unfathomable to think that he is now gone.

'He
had a tremendous passion for life and for the art of film-making and 
was able to share this passion with all of us through his cinematic 
brilliance,' he added.

There
had been reports that Scott was suffering from inoperable brain cancer,
but the Los Angeles Coroner's office has said his family were not aware
of any such illness.

A
dive team pulled Scott's body from the water several hours after 
members of the public alerted emergency services, having seen him jump 
from the bridge.

A suicide 
note is said to have been found at his office and he had left contact 
details in his black Toyota Prius parked close to the scene.

He was behind numerous slick action movies and worked with some of the biggest names in the film world, including John Travolta and Gene Hackman.

Scott, who lived in Beverly Hills, was married to actress Donna Scott, his third wife with whom he had twin sons.

He ran Scott Free Productions with his brother and the pair were working on a film called Killing Lincoln.

British actress Keira Knightley, who worked with Scott on his 2005 film Domino, in which she starred as a bounty hunter, said: 'Tony Scott was one of the most extraordinary, imaginative men I ever worked with.

'It was a privilege to have spent the time I did with him. He was a firecracker and one of the world's true originals.'

His other films included True Romance, Crimson Tide, Enemy Of The State, The Last Boy Scout, Revenge and Man On Fire.
