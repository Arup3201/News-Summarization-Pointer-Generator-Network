An 80-year-old Florida woman accidentally swallowed a $5,000 diamond that had been placed in her glass of champagne at an charity event.

Miriam Tucker was attending the event organized by the Tampa Women's Club last weekend.

As a surprise for the attendees, the organizers filled each of the 400 flutes of champagne with a cubic zirconia, except for one which contained a $5,000 diamond donated by a local jeweler.

Whoops: Miriam Tucker swallowed the diamond which was in a glass of champagne

The $5,000 diamond had been donated by a local jeweler to be a prize at the charity event organized by the Tampa Women's Club last weekend

The idea was that at the end of the evening everyoneâ€™s glass would be checked and whoever had the diamond would be allowed to keep it.

But disaster struck after Miriam unwittingly swallowed everything that was in her flute.

'We were laughing and talking when I realized I swallowed it. What a dumb thing,' the retired realtor told the Miami Herald.

To begin with Miriam hid her embarrassment about what she had done, hopeful that someone else would be found to have the diamond and announced the winner.

Eventually Miriam was forced to came forward and admit what she had done. Immediately she was taken to a local hospital for an x-ray, only to find out that diamonds don't show up on x-rays.

Fortunately
 for Miriam she had a routine colonoscopy booked for the next day which turned out to be anything but routine.

She gave her doctor
 strict instructions to be on the lookout for something sparkling.

Her doctor found the elusive diamond, but Miriam still had to check out if it was the winning jewel, so Miriam stopped by the jewelry store to have the diamond tested.

'She came with it in a bio-hazard bag
 and it wasn't even cleaned,' said Joy Pierson, a partner at Continental
 Wholesale Diamond which had donated the precious stone.

Once the diamond was washed and steamed it was tested and confirmed as the winning diamond, which Miriam has decided to keep as a family heirloom.
