Susan Crockett escaped death by climbing out the window of her house in Palm Coast, Florida

A woman who lost her home and severely injured her shoulder during a plane crash that killed three people has filed a claim against the Federal Aviation Administration.

Susan Crockett was at her home in Palm Coast, Florida, when a four-seat 1957 Beechcraft H35 Bonanza crashed into it on Jan. 4, 2013.

The plane was headed to  Knoxville, Tennessee, but was attempting to make an emergency landing at Flagler County Airport.

Crockett was able to escape through a window at her home moments after the plane crashed, but pilot Michael Anders, 58, and passengers Duane Shaw, 59 and Charissee Peoples, 42, were killed. 

It was Anders' birthday and Shaw and Peoples were engaged to be married.

Crockett lost her home because it was deemed 'uninhabitable' and torn down. 

She was also forced to undergo surgery on her shoulder after injuring it during her escape.

Anders did not have insurance at the time of the crash, so Crockett has been paying medical bills and other 'significant expenses' herself.

She filed the claim because there is no federal or state requirement for small private planes to carry insurance and believes the FAA should implement a policy requiring pilots to be insured against accidents.

The crash claimed the lives of three people: Michael Anders, 58, Duane Shaw, 59 and Charissee Peoples, 42

The claim also states Crockett has been suffering from 'the psychological aftermath of the trauma', according to WESH. 

It's unclear how much Crockett is seeking in damages. 

She said: 'It seems like this is what I have to do to get someone to listen: bring a lawsuit.

'No one should have to go through what I went through — to have your life destroyed and no one is accountable for that.'

A review by the National Transportation Safety Board found that both Anders and air traffic controllers were partly responsible for the crash, another factor that prompted Crockett and her attorney, Marc Dwyer, to file the claim, the Palm Coast Observer reported. 

The government has six months to analyze the claim before the case could potentially be heard in a federal court.

Crockett's home was deemed 'uninhabitable' after the crash, one of the factors which prompted the claim 

Dwyer said: 'If it becomes a court case... either a judge or jury will decide what percentage of the blame air traffic control is assigned, and they would be responsible for that share.

'The only way I can force the government to make changes to the current regulations is to file a claim against them.

'We want to see some change. I think it's clearly obvious that the pilot played a major role in it, and he will pay no role in covering Mrs. Crockett's damages.'

Most of the plane was destroyed in the crash, but one of its wings remained intact after impact
