Calum Chambers first came to Arsene Wenger's attention in Arsenal's 2-2 draw at Southampton in January.

Chambers moved to the Emirates Stadium for £12million in the summer and has been a virtual ever-present for the Gunners, playing at right back and deputising at centre half.

'I was impressed by his understanding of the game and his interception qualities,' said Wenger of the 19-year-old defender who played 90 minutes against his former club in Arsenal's 1-0 win against Southampton on Wednesday night.

The Arsenal defender has been a virtual ever-present for the Gunners this season

'The first time I watched him was in our 2-2 draw against Southampton when we played them away last season.

'I liked the fact that he was early on the ball. His reading of the game and his transition to quickly go forward also stood out, and his touch was good as well.

'I checked his birth date after the game and was very interested.'

Sanchez drilled home Aaron Ramsey's pass as Arsenal stole a late winner at the Emirates after Southampton had been reduced to 10 men due to Toby Alderweireld limping off with a hamstring injury six minutes from time.

It was the Gunners' third game in eight days and Wenger was impressed with Sanchez's unwillingness to settle for a point.

'Alexis is one of the players who had to dig deep, but he still had such desire to fight. He always finds something special to get a goal'. said Wenger.

'It's difficult to find examples of someone who has settled at a club so quickly. He arrived in July and now it's December.

'When you look at the number of goals he has and the impact he has on the team, it's fabulous.'
