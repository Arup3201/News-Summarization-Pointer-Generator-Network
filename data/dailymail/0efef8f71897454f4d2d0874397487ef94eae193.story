Charged: Jared Ehlers is accused of stealing and destroying a fossil

A Utah man accused of prizing a fossilized dinosaur print from a rock and then throwing it in the Colorado river could face up to 20 years in prison.

Jared Ehlers was indicted on four charges over the theft of the 190 million-year-old print, believed to have been left by an Allosauraus in what is now the Sands Flats recreation area of Moab.

Dive teams have been searching for the three-toed print, which was a popular tourist attraction, since Saturday, after police were tipped off that it had been thrown from a bridge.

Ehlers is accused of taking the scientifically important fossil, which was roughly 1ft by 3ft in size, on February 17.

It was first reported missing by Kent Green, a guide who had been taking tourists to see the tracks in the sandstone on February 18.

Green, whose Moab Cowboy Country Adventures tour company regularly takes visitors to the prints, was horrified to hear the priceless fossil had been thrown in the river.

'Why in the heck would somebody do that? Why wouldn't they just leave it where somebody could find it?' he told the Desert News.

The sandstone containing the print was loose and it appeared as if the fossil had been pried out with some sort of tool, paleontologist Rebecca Hunt-Foster said.

The footprint was one of 20 left by what is believed to have been an Allosaurus, one of the most dangerous carnivores of the Jurassic period.

A spokesman for the Bureau of Land 
Management said: 'When fossils like these are taken, we lose 
irreplaceable scientific and educational opportunities to explore some 
of the natural history that makes Utah's public lands so special.'

The
 section of sandstone where the track was taken is known as the Dinosaur
 Trackway, after prints from several species of dinosaur were discovered
 there in 1989.

Several
 tour operators and off-road groups who use the park offered a $7,000 
reward for the return of the fossil or information about what had 
happened to it.

Ehlers, who runs a construction business, allegedly came forward on Saturday, and told police where he had dumped it.

His reasons for allegedly taking the print and then throwing it away are not yet known.

Paleontologists
 hope that dive teams using sonar will be able to find the fossil. 
Because it has an element of limestone, it is hoped the ancient print 
will survive.

Predator: The Allosaurus was one of the most dangerous carnivores in the Jurassic period

Ehlers is facing prosecution under the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, which was passed to prevent fossils from theft and vandalism.

He faces one count each of theft, depredation, removal, and destruction of government property. The most serious count, destruction of evidence, has a maximum sentence of 20 years, and the others carry prison terms of five and ten years.
