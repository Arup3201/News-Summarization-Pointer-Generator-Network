A baby boy is set to become a life saver before his first birthday by donating bone marrow to his older sister who suffers from an incredibly rare illness.

Little Jacob Davis, who is just 10 months old, will undergo the operation in a bid to help his sister, Seren-Rose, two.

Seren-Rose, of West Mersea, Essex, is one of just 150 youngsters in the UK to suffer from the condition known as mucopolysaccharidosis.

The disease has left her with  with brain damage and learning difficulties.

The condition slows a child's development and as a result the toddler is still unable to speak.

It is more commonly known as Hurler's disease.

Unfortunately, the bone marrow transplant will not cure Seren-Rose but it could help prevent her health deteriorate further.

Her parents, Simon and Elouise, were devastated to discover they were not suitable matches for their young daughter but it emerged that Jacob is a match.

The life-changing transplant is now set to take place next month before Jacob’s first birthday.

Mr Davis, 48, said: 'Jacob will grow up knowing he saved his sister’s life.

We are elated - it is better if the marrow comes from a sibling rather than from another donor.

'The recovery time will be quicker and the chance of it "taking" is a lot higher.'

Seren-Rose has MPS I which is also known as Hurler disease.

Hurler 
disease takes its name from Gertrud Hurler, the doctor who first 
described a boy and girl with the condition in 1919.

Although there is no cure for MPS diseases, there are ways of managing and treating the problems they cause.

Individuals with MPS disease are missing a key enzyme which means 
incompletely broken down mucopolysaccharides remain stored in cells in 
the body causing progressive damage to brain and body.

Babies may show little sign of the disease, but as more and more cells become damaged, symptoms start to appear.

Children with Hurler disease have progressive developmental delay and severe progressive physical problems.

Seren-Rose will undergo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation with 
the blood stem cells taken from her brother Jacob’s bone marrow.

The transplant does not repair damage already done but will stop the disease progressing further.

Seren-Rose was only diagnosed with the incredibly rare condition in December 2013.

Now, the youngster will have to undergo chemotherapy before she can be given her brother's bone marrow. She will be confined to hospital for two months with some of that time in strict isolation to reduce the risk of infection.

Unfortunately, the transplant cannot repair the damage already done.

Mrs Davis admitted it will be tough seeing her baby boy undergo the operation.

She said: 'When I got the news that Jacob was a match, part of me was a little sad because I do not want him to undergo any discomfort.

'We’ve been told he will be sore for a couple of days.

'The way I look at it is, he will have a couple of days of soreness but he will have a lifetime of knowing he has given his sister the gift of life.

'I think when they grow up they will have a special bond. I am proud of both of them.

'I think Jacob will be very protective over her safety and really proud of what he has done for her.'

The family has been supported by the MPS Society who provide advice for people suffering for mucopolysaccharide diseases. 

Mr Davis, who is a maintenance manager, will undertake a 24-hour radio broadcast next month to raise vital funds for the charity.
