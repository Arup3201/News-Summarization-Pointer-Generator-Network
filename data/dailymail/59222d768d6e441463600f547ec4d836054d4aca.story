Not backing down: Mr Cameron could seek court injunctions to prevent publication of classified information

David Cameron last night threatened to take legal action against newspapers that leak ‘damaging’ details of intelligence operations.

The Prime Minister warned the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, which has printed classified information from renegade spy Edward Snowden, that it faced court injunctions if it continues to print claims about the activities of the GCHQ listening station.

The newspaper, he said, was refusing to behave with ‘social responsibility’ despite repeated warnings that the revelations are damaging to national security.

Mr Cameron threatened to impose a 
D-Notice – an official Whitehall instruction not to print specific items
– on newspapers which reveal details of highly sensitive intelligence 
operations.

While a 
D-Notice is not legally enforceable, Mr Cameron signalled that ministers
could also seek court injunctions to prevent publication.

Mr Cameron acknowledged that The 
Guardian had let agents of the security services destroy computer hard 
drives containing some of Snowden’s material after being warned that 
terrorists could access it on their servers.

But he made clear that his patience is wearing thin after the latest batch of revelations – that the Americans have bugged the phones of 35 world leaders and that British intelligence has eavesdropped on Italian and Spanish citizens.

The Prime Minister told MPs: ‘We have a free Press, it’s very important the Press feels it is not pre-censored from what it writes. The approach we have taken is to try to talk to the Press and explain how damaging some of these things can be, and that is why The Guardian did actually destroy some of the information and discs that they have. But they’ve now gone on and printed further material which is damaging.

‘I don’t want to have to use injunctions or D-Notices or the other tougher measures. I think it’s much better to appeal to newspapers’ sense of social responsibility. But if they don’t demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for Government to stand back and not to act.’ 

A Downing Street source said the government could intervene ‘if we were aware that they have material that could be published’.

That would give ministers broad scope to gag newspapers in the courts since security chiefs are already aware of material stolen by Snowden which has not yet seen the light of day in the media.

It emerged yesterday that spy chiefs lost track of terrorists after Snowden’s leaks. Militants stopped using electronic communications after he revealed the extent of monitoring by GCHQ and the American National Security Agency.

In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cameron said serious attempts were made to attack Britain once or twice a year, and highlighted to MPs that 330 people had been convicted of  terrorism offences in British courts since the 9/11 terror attacks. ‘I quote these figures just to demonstrate the scale of the ongoing threat we face in our country,’ Mr Cameron said.
