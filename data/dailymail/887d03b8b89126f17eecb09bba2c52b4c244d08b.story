It was on a camping trip two years ago in the Tahoe National Forest that Murphy, a golden retriever ran off after being scared by a gunshots.

Nathan and Erin Braun were camping in October 2012 when their five-year-old dog ran away.

They ended up posting fliers and even set up a Facebook page for her, hoping against hope that somebody somewhere would find her. 

Despite receiving no responses, they continued to hold out hope.

Found! Almost two years after Murphy the golden retriever went missing on a camping trip in Tahoe National Forest, the thin, frail dog has been reunited with her family

It paid off: The family kept searching for Murphy for two years until finally she was spotted not far from where she disappeared

Then, earlier this month, a camper at French Meadows Reservoir saw a similar-looking dog some five miles from where Murphy she had originally gone missing.

Remembering the search that had taken place years earlier, the Brauns were notified and drove to the campsite.

They even decide to leave their dogs' old bed and some clothing with the campground host in the hope the dog might sniff them out.

The plan worked! A week later, the host of the campsite found Murphy had been sleeping on the blanket and curling up in clothing they had left behind.

Glimmer: Earlier this month, a camper at French Meadows Reservoir saw the dog five miles from where she had gone missing. Upon being notified, the Brauns immediately drove from their home in El Dorado Hills to the site

We're glad to have you back: Nathan Braun says the family are completely shocked and amazed with the miracle of having Murphy back

The Brauns wrote that the campsite host had even been able to coax her into a kennel.

'The very first night I laid it out I heard some movement,' Jason Smith told KXTV-TV of Sacramento.

'There was Murphy, sleeping on the blanket. And right there I knew, that's Murphy. That's their dog. It was curled up with its head on the hat.'

The dog was very thin and frail, but Murphy is now on the road to recovery.

'After 20 long months of being in the Tahoe National Forest, Murphy has come home. As you can imagine we are completely shocked and amazed with the miracle of her surviving this long,' the family said.

'As you can imagine we are completely shocked and amazed with the miracle of her surviving this long,' the Brauns said.

The Brauns say that Murphy is 'happy to be home with her family'.

'We have so many people to thank the list is endless. Words can not describe how grateful we are,' - the family wrote that now they feel whole once again. 

Trying every tactic: After several days of searching proved unsuccessful, the Brauns left Murphy's old bed and some of their clothing with the campground host, hoping the dog would respond and she did
