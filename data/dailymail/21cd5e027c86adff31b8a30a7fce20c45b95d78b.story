Big tobacco companies are pushing for electronic cigarettes to enter the Australian market as a 'medicine' but health groups fear the unregulated device could encourage young people into taking up the habit.

British American Tobacco has been lobbying Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration to allow them to sell e-cigarettes at any corner stores and roll out major marketing campaign to promote the medicinal benefits of the product.

The cigarette shaped devices are a multi-billion dollar industry overseas but in Australia they remain unregulated and legally contentious, according to ABC.

Designed to reduce the harm of smoking, the battery-powered device simulate the effects of smoking by heating a nicotine liquid into vapour and gives smokers a nicotine hit without producing smoke.

But long-time tobacco opponent from Sydney University Professor, Simon Chapman told ABC that describing e-cigarettes as a medicine was 'Orwellian' and destructive to society.

'That's the only word I can think [of] that's apposite here,' he said.

'Down the corridor in BAT [British American Tobacco] you have a division who are spending all their days trying to work out how to gut, thwart, and ruin any policy like plain packaging.'

Nicoventures, owned by British American Tobacco first sought a meeting with the Therapeutic Goods Administration in November 2013 'to fully explain our medicines-based approach to these agencies', according to ABC.

After the meeting was confirmed for December 2013, the company claimed it was motivated by protecting smokers' health. 

'Thanks again for making time to see us, this is an area of much focus globally and we are committed to bringing these products to market and so reducing the harm caused by smoking in the population,' the letter said.

But professor Chapman told ABC the letter was 'duplicity'.

'It's hypocrisy, it's fork-tongued talk. It's everything that we have come to expect from the tobacco industry over the last 40 or 50 years,' he said.

ABC reports the big tobacco companies denied after decades that smoking killed people but in a brief prepared for the TGA, the letter said: 'Smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable illness and early death in England and most of the Western world.

'If smoking cessation products can achieve a greater acceptance among smokers by offering craving relief, coupled with rapid absorption and mimicking many aspects of a cigarette ... they will enable a greater proportion of the smoking population to begin their journey towards quitting or substitution of cigarettes with medicinal nicotine products.'

Royal Australasian College of Physicians president Professor Nicholas Talley said there is no evidence that using e-cigarettes leads to people quitting or smoking less

It also claimed the e-cigarettes would mean smokers: 'Begin their journey towards quitting or substitution of cigarettes with medicinal nicotine products.' 

Royal Australasian College of Physicians president Professor Nicholas Talley told ABC that there is no evidence that using e-cigarettes leads to people quitting or smoking less.

But other health groups have disagreed and described the smoking device as potentially life-saving.
