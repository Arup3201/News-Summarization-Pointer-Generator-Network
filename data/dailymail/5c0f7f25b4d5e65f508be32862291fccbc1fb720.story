A man who touched millions with a photo of him bathing with his arthritic dog to ease his pain, has a new pet.

John Unger, from  Bayfield, Wisconsin, took his former dog Schoep into Lake Superior to help with the animal's arthritis, and his friend Hannah Stonehouse Hudson captured an image that reached millions in 2012.

Schoep, a shepherd mix, later died in July 2013 at the age of 20.

Mr Unger has now adopted a new dog named Bear, a year and seven months later.

Mr Unger has adopted a new dog, a one-year-old Akita-Shepherd-Labrador mix named Bear, from the Northwoods Humane Society

'I am whole again...' the man posted on a Facebook page for Schoep that has attracted almost 390,000 followers.

The post announcing the new dog has received more than 73,000 likes on the social network. 

Bear is a one-year-old 70 lb Akita-Shepherd-Labrador mix adopted from the Northwoods Humane Society.

Mr Unger says that Schoep was instrumental in his battling depression following a bad breakup when he adopted him as a puppy in 1993.

He said the dog helped him fight thoughts of suicide. 

The man, now in his 50s, later repaid the faithful canine, who had been abused by his previous owner, by taking him into the water to ease pain from inflamed joints.

Schoep, who had just begun to limp, fell asleep against Mr Unger's shoulder during a photo shoot. 

Thousands of dollars raised after Ms Hudson's photo went viral helped pay for laser treatments for Schoep before he died. 

'It was really tough after Schoep left and didn't know what to do with my time,' Mr Unger said, according to USA Today. 

'It was re-learning how to live and once I learned that and once I got through the toughness of his love that's when I started searching again.'

Mr Unger said that he still talks to Schoep and thanks him for everything.

He said that he is working on a possible book. 

John
 Unger adopted Schoep, who is named after a famous brand of 
Wisconsin ice cream, when he was just a puppy and it was love at first 
sight.

Schoep and Mr Unger were together for 20 years

He and his ex-fiancée had been searching for a rescue dog for a year, going to dozens of humane societies.

'We wanted every single dog,' Mr Unger told Daily Mail Online.

'We just hadn't found the right one.'

His then-fiancée they spotted the pup at the Ozaukee Animal Shelter 19 years ago.

'We fell in love with her immediately,' Mr Unger said.

Schoep
 was in a cage with another dog, possibly his mother, crouched in the 
back quietly staring at the corner with his back to Mr Unger.

'I knew - that's him,' Mr Unger said.

At the time Schoep was named Tramp by the shelter staff and showed signs of abuse.

'He didn't even know what toys were,' Mr Unger said.

'I really wanted this dog because I wanted him to enjoy life.'

The couple worked hard to establish the trust of the dog and eventually brought out its 'full potential'.
