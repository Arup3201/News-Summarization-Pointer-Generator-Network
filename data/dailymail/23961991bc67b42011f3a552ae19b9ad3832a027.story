Police are questioning a man about the brutal rape and murder of a 28-year-old mother, who was snatched from outside a Texas beach house six years ago, while her two-year-old child slept inside.

Bridgette Gearen had been spending the weekend with her daughter, Kyra, and friends at Crystal Beach when she was snatched by four men just before midnight, and raped, beaten and strangled.

Six years later Galveston County police are questioning a man they arrested on a separate charge in relation to the violent attack on the legal assistant from Beaumont.

Victim: Bridgette Gearen, who was raped and strangled on a beach, with her daughter Krya

Crime scene: Bridgette was staying with friends at Crystal Beach when she was snatched by four men in a SUV

Her body was found dumped at the water's edge the following morning. She had tried desperately to fight off her violent attackers in a case a police chief says is the worst he has seen in his 40-year career.

The suspect, who has not yet been named, is in his 20s and from the area, police said. Since the attack they have been trying to trace four men who they believe grabbed Miss Gearen in the short moment she was alone outside.

'This person isn’t going anywhere for a long, long, long time,' Lieutenant Tommy Hansen, who says he will not retire until the killers are brought to justice, told KHou news.

He believes the suspect may be able to identify the other men involved, and warned the murderers: 'We're coming.'

Earlier in the case, Lieutenant Hansen, said: 'We feel very comfortable it was 
multiple suspects, primarily from out of state, who may have possibly 
hooked up with a local person from [the Crystal Beach] area.'

For Miss Gearen's daughter, Kyra, who had been with her that night, the pain of losing her mother is still fresh.

'It’s like a big hole straight in the 
middle of your heart,' Kyra Portie, 8, said. 'She was young and nobody 
deserves to be killed like that.'

Kyra had been staying at the Bolivar Peninsula beach house with her mother and friends on the night Miss Gearen was taken.

The legal assistant went outside at about midnight, as the group of friends decided to take a midnight drive along the coast in July 2007.

Her friends said they heard the gate close behind her, but moments later there was no trace of her.

Witnesses saw her getting into a dark colored SUV with four men, though they were not sure if she was being threatened.

A short time later teenagers who were on the beach heard her screams.

'Twenty-five minutes later that same vehicle went back by going eastbound at a very high rate of speed,' Lieutenant Hansen said.

'I'm going to rank it as one of the most violent things I've seen,' he added.

An autopsy on the 28-year-old's body showed she had been the victim of a violent sexual assault. She had had been beaten about the face with a blunt object and strangled in an attack that may have lasted for two hours, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Her body was found by walkers the next morning, naked except for her red top.

'[Her] clothes were ripped. Her body was half in the water. She was bruised pretty badly,' Kyra's father, Brandon Portie, said.

'It’s tough. They definitely need to be hurt; punished for what they did.'

Residents and vacationers at Crystal Beach were so shocked by the violent attack, and lack of arrest, that many say they no longer feel safe walking alone on the beach.

'This haunts us every day. We mourn every day,' Miss Gearen's mother, Pamela Kimball said at a press conference last year. 'Do you know what her little girl thinks about her mom being taken away?'

At the same event, Krya pleaded with her mother's killers to come forward. Reading from a statement she had written on pink paper, the little girl said: 'I love my mommy so much and it makes me sad that I could only see her the first two years of my life.'
