A Frenchman who was left stranded in the US after being deemed too heavy to fly home on a British Airways flight has finally arrived back in Europe.

Kevin Chenais, 22, had flown from his home in France to spend 18 months at the world famous Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for treatment for a rare hormone disorder that affects body growth and caused his weight to balloon.

While British Airways were happy to fly him to America they refused to honour his return ticket in October due to his weight and Kevin was left stranded.

Take-off: Kevin Chenais - who has a hormone imbalance and went to the United States for treatment - touched down at Heathrow yesterday

But this week Virgin Airways stepped in with an
offer and Kevin touched down at Heathrow at 9am this morning on
a flight from New York.

His father Rene Chenais said he was not sure how the family would proceed after they arrived in London.

It is
the latest development in a saga that began last month when British 
Airways determined the Kevin, who weighs 230 kilograms (35 stone) was too 
heavy to have on board.

Refusal: He was refused a British Airways flight after the airline determined the 22-year-old, who weighs 230 kilograms (500 pounds), was too heavy to have on board

Kevin and his parents were stuck at a hotel close to Chicago Airport because British Airways refusal and were preparing to travel to New York to sail home on the liner Queen Mary.

But the Queen Mary 'also didn't want to 
board Kevin, citing health security reasons,' according to the family.

The family, who had been at the hotel for more than a week, said they blamed the airline for leaving them with few options.

Kevin's mother Christina Chenais said 'We are so grateful to Virgin for stepping in when we were running out of options.

'If British Airways could bring him to the US there must have been a way to bring him back home. His condition hasn't changed.

Kevin's father criticised British Airways for paying just five nights in a hotel, where in the end they spent 13 days

'They just abandoned us. We were so upset and distressed by their behaviour whilst Virgin have been absolutely magnificent.'

The family, who being financially stretched by the circumstances, said BA was aware of the medical condition before they sold Kevin a ticket.

Kevin's father criticised British Airways for paying just five nights in a hotel, where in the end they spent 13 days. He said the carrier has yet to refund their tickets.

Two or three days after British Airways refused to let him fly, the family's travel agent said Air France and Swissair were willing to take him. But they wanted extra cash and the family was out of money.

'We paid $1,200 for the train to New York and then $2,000 for the ship. We couldn't pay any more,' said Mr Chenais.

It was then that Virgin stepped in with a free offer. However the family still have to get back from London to Geneva, the airport nearest their home.

A BA spokesman said: 'We will always try to accommodate someone if it's possible and safe to do so'

A BA spokesman said: 'We will always try to accommodate someone if it's possible and safe to do so.'Our customer service team worked diligently to find a solution and have exhausted all options.

'Unfortunately it is not possible to safely accommodate the customer on any of our aircraft and the family has been offered a full refund.

'The British Airways team has been in regular contact with the family, providing guidance and support as well as exploring other options for travel. BA has also provided hotel accommodation throughout.'

Chenais - who requires 
round-the-clock oxygen and medical attention - came to the United States
from France in May 2012 for treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.

His
health problems, which have prevented him from living a normal life, 
began when he was just six months old, according to the father.

Despite
all the 'setbacks,' Chenais said his son - who had looked forward to 
taking the Queen Mary - was 'a little sad' to be leaving the United 
States.
