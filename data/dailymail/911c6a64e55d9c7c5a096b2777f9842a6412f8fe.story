Dolphins are said to share the human traits of bravery, jealousy and even a sense of humour.

But it seems they share some worrying vices as well.

Scientists were amazed at footage of the mammals apparently getting 'high' with the help of a toxic puffer fish.

Seaworld sillies: Dolphins have been filmed eating toxic puffer fish, which when digested in small doses can have a 'narcotic-like effect'

In
 an extraordinary scene filmed for a new TV series, the dolphins are 
shown gently passing the fish between them. Experts believe the 
creatures are using the toxins, which emerge from the puffer fish as 
part of its defence mechanism, for their own enjoyment.

They nudge the fish with their snouts and as the toxin is released into the water, they seem to lapse into a trance-like state.

At one point the dolphins are seen floating just underneath the water's surface, apparently mesmerised by their own reflections.

The
 dolphins were filmed gently playing with the puffer, passing it between
 each other for 20 to 30 minutes at a time, unlike the fish they had 
caught as prey which were swiftly torn apart.

The
 footage, from a forthcoming BBC1 show called Dolphins: Spy  in the Pod,
 was taken by wildlife  filmmaker John Downer – who has previously used 
hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television 
screens.

Mr Downer designed underwater cameras disguised as squid, tuna and even other dolphins.

Zoologist and series producer Rob Pilley said that it was the first time dolphins had been filmed behaving this way.

He
 added: 'We saw the dolphins handle the puffers with kid gloves, very 
gently and delicately like they were almost milking them to not upset 
the fish too much or kill it.

'As a result the fish released various toxins as a defence.

'The dolphins then seemed to  be mesmerised.'

He
 insisted that the scene couldn't have been a one-off encounter, saying:
 'The dolphins were specifically going for the puffers and deliberately 
handling them with care.'

Fun-loving fish: The dolphins were filmed watching their reflections just below the surface in the series which used cameras disguised as sea creatures including a dolphin to get a glimpse of the mysterious life of the mammal

Never seen before: Viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water, as well as finding themselves at the centre of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once in the up close footage

The BBC1 series follows the success 
of Penguins: Spy In the Huddle, which used similar tactics of disguised 
cameras, documentary producer Mr Downer was eager to create a range of 
cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented 
proximity to their favourite species. 

As
 well as the Dolphincam, the Tunacam, Turtlecam and Squidcam have also 
been created for different spying roles, with each fitted with HD 
cameras to capture life under the sea.

With the help of the cameras, viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water, as well as finding themselves at the centre of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once.  

Hundreds of hours of filming were put into the programme which will be narrated by David Tennant. Some 900 hours of raw footage collected over a year from around the world including America, Coasta Rica, South Africa, Argentina and Australia. The puffer fish footage was filmed in waters near Mozambique.

The film crew also dived some 1,500 times, spending nearly 3,000 hours at sea filming with the Spy Creatures in all types of weather.

Secretive sea creatures: With the use of the secret cameras and human dive crews, a huge amount of raw footage was collected such as this close-up with a bottlenose dolphin

Speaking of the project, Mr Downer said: 'Unlike Penguin-cams, this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast-moving dolphins, often out in the deep ocean. 

'The dolphins were very curious about their new neighbours and allowed them into their lives.'

Downer's last project, Spy in the Huddle, took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year. 

The first of the two-part series will air on Thursday, January 2 at 8pm on BBC1.
