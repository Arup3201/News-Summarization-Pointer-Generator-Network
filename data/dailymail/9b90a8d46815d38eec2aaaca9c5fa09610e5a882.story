The son of a Connecticut police chief has been indicted by a federal grand jury after he was seen on video throwing a handcuffed inmate into a jail cell and cracking his head on a metal bench, which knocked him unconscious.

The May 2010 battery is just one of three police brutality complaints against Meriden police Officer Evan Cossett, who allegedly avoided discipline because his father Jeffrey Cossett leads the department.

Surveillance video inside the cell shows Evan Cossett shoving Pedro Temich backwards as his hands are cuffed behind his back. When he falls, Temich hits his head and is clearly out cold.

'Brutality': Officer Evan Cossette is seen with Pedro Temich after the handcuffed prisoner was knocked unconscious when he hit his head

Injured: Temich bashed his head against a bench in the cell and required several stitches after he was found unconscious by an emergency dispatcher. Cossett is accused of lying in his police report

Cossett doesn't go for medical help, and instead re-enters the cell several times to move the unconscious prisoner around, first propping him up and then removing his handcuffs.

A pool of blood is visible on the floor of the cell.

Authorities say Cossett then lied about the incident in his police report, claiming that Temich had resisted him and tried to fight, according to the Meriden Record Journal.

An internal affairs supervisor initially recommended that Cossetted be disciplined with a temporary suspension.

However, Deputy Chief Timothy Topulos intervened in the case and instead issued a letter of reprimand and ordered him to go to training -- a much less severe punishment.

Record of complaints: In January Cossett and another officer were recorded beating a man outside a hospital

The alleged assault in 2010 wasn't Cossett's last.

In January, he and another Meriden police officer beat a 30-year-old man who was drunk and walking away from a hospital where he had just been committed.

Surveillance video captured Cossett punching Joey Bryans several times as he was held on the ground.

The video also shows Cossett shocking Mr Bryans several times with a taser while he is restrained, as well.

Mr Bryans, Mr Temich and a third man, Robert Methvin, are all suing the Meriden Police Department, alleging that they were abused at Cossett's hands.

The brutality case came to the attention of city authorities when two of Cossett's fellow officers complained to city officials that he had received special treatment because his father is the chief.

An independent investigation launched by the city found insufficient evidence that the police department conspired to keep Cossett out of trouble.

However, the Connecticut State Police and the FBI continued to investigate the brutality allegations.

Cossett faces up to 30 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine, if convicted.
