Once they delighted children with pictures of angels, stars and donkeys, but Advent calendars have now departed so far from tradition that one from Ann Summers even features a naked man posing under a Christmas tree.

Now a Christian website – dismayed by the proliferation of such secular themes – is urging readers to vote for the ‘Badvent’ calendar of the year.

In a tongue-in-cheek competition aimed at highlighting the lack of calendars using images from the Bible, the Ship Of Fools website has selected eight of the worst offenders.

A very merry Christmas indeed: This Advent calendar comes with 24 different whiskies and costs £149.95

The most pricey – at £149.95 on Amazon – is the Drinks By The Dram: The Whisky Advent Calendar, in which miniature bottles of different brands are hidden behind the windows.

The Ship Of Fools editors comment on their website: ‘Forget gold, frankincense and myrrh. Why didn’t the wise men turn up with 24 different whiskies?’

There is also a calendar offering chocolates in ‘different music designs’ that shows a red-faced Father Christmas making a vulgar two-fingered gesture while his boot rests on a skull, under a sign reading ‘Live loud!’.

The Barbie Advent calendar, on sale online from £17.97, offers a new fashion accessory for every day. 

In a similar vein, the fashion brand Ciate has a 24-piece mini nail polish collection for the run-up to Christmas, priced at £49.99. 

The Ship Of Fools editors said: ‘To think Mary could have whiled away the hours on the back of that donkey glamming up a bit for Bethlehem.’

Lego has a Star Wars-themed calendar, while others feature ‘Eric the Elephant’ or dog treats.

But the most provocative is Ann Summers’ Naughty Advent Calendar, showing a nude male model leaning on a decorated Christmas tree with a strategically-placed present to cover his modesty.

Hidden behind the 24 windows are pieces of milk chocolate shaped like intimate parts of the body – all for just £5. 

The website comments: ‘Trust Ms Summers to remind us that Christmas was, in part, about reproductive organs.’

The former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said: ‘The commercialisation of these calendars does sadden me because they miss something deeply important about Advent and the Christmas story.’ 

Ship Of Fools co-editor Steve Goddard added: ‘We’re not calling on shops to get rid of these but to give shoppers alternatives which tell the Bethlehem story. Modern Advent calendars are another depressing sign of the way big business tramples on something beautiful in its desperation to make a profit.’

The result of the vote will be unveiled today. Ann Summers declined to comment.
