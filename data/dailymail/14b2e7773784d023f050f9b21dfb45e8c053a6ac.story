Philippe Senderos has joined Aston Villa on a two-year deal to become Paul Lambert’s first signing of the summer.

The 29-year-old, who flies to out to the World Cup with Switzerland on Friday, moves on a free transfer from Valencia where he spent the second half of last season after leaving Fulham.

Lambert has been searching for an experienced centre-back to play alongside Dutch international Ron Vlaar and had chased Joleon Lescott but his wages are more than the club can afford.

Deal: Philippe Senderos has joined Aston Villa on a two-year deal to become their first summer signing

Fresh start: Senderos wrapped the deal up before beginning Switzerland's World Cup campaign

Swiss boss Ottmar Hitzfeld, Lambert’s manager when he was a player at Borussia Dortmund, played a part in getting the deal done by praising the former Arsenal player to the Villa manager.

‘I went to Switzerland not long ago to watch the national team train and I could see he has a good, strong mentality for the game,’ said Lambert. ‘Ottmar knows players and for him to say that Philippe has never disappointed him on the pitch, that's no small commendation.

‘This will be Philippe's third World Cup finals and there aren't too many players who compete at that level over that stretch of time. He'll be a great addition to the group.’

Senderos added: ‘I’m really delighted to be joining Aston Villa, a great club with such a big history, and for me this is a great step in my career.

‘There will be a lot of competition for places with Ron Vlaar, Ciaran Clark, Nathan Baker and Jores Okore also very capable Premier League defenders, so it will be up to me to fight for and to earn my place in the team.

‘This is a team and a club which wants to do better, I know this, and hopefully we can all develop together and create something special.’
