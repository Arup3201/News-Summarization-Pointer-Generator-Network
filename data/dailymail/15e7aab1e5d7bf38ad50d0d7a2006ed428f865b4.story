A new study has revealed that a quarter of ads for luxury goods shown on Facebook are selling counterfeit products. 

The study was conducted by Italian cyber-security researchers Andrew Stroppa and Agostino Spechhiarello, who analyzed 1,000 ads on Facebook to reach their finding - and urged the social network to do do more to protect consumers.

According to Bloomberg, 24per cent of the fashion and luxury ads on Facebook hawk fake goods, even though the social media website claims it is making a conscious effort to try to remove these ads.

Ray Ban was one of the brand researchers found targeted most, along with Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren.

The global counterfeiting market has reached unprecedented levels. 

Counterfeit goods now account for nearly 10 percent of worldwide trade, an estimated $500 billion annually, according to the World Customs Organization.

According to the pair, 180 of the 1,000 ads were luxury and fashion listings. 

Ray Bay sunglasses, Louis Vuitton bags, and Ralph Lauren polo shirts were all among the most popular items offered for sale. 

Of those, 43 were for counterfeit goods, linking to phony websites made to look like the real thing.

A picture promoting Ray-Ban sunglasses, for instance, will connect you to a website that features all the same branding, but with slight alterations indicating that it is a fake.

The same goes for ads for handbags, designer clothing or accessories. 

Many of the phony e-commerce sites are registered under Chinese front companies, according to the review.

Researchers set up automatic Facebook accounts to activate and gather the specific ads promoted by the social network. 

Once they had gathered the ads, the team manually analysed each one, to see which pointed to a 'real' supplier and which to a counterfeit firm. 

Clicking on the ads led consumers to fake sites designed to look exactly like the real thing, the team said.

The researchers found sites use a variety of tricks to fool both consumers and Facebook.

They including designing sites to look like the 'real' brand, and even choosing domain names that are very similar.  

'Facebook should do more, and must do more against this,' they told Mashable. 

A spokesperson for Facebook told Bloomberg that they go to great lengths to prevent these ads from appearing on the site. 

'We prohibit fraudulent or misleading claims or content,' the spokesperson said.

They then tried to track the sites, finding many were based in China. 

'And to enforce our terms and policies, we have invested significant resources in developing a robust advertising review program that includes both automated and manual review of ads.' 

The researchers also noted that since they started researching the issue, many of the illegitimate ads have been removed. 

Google also faces similar issues. 

It removed more than 350 million 'bad ads' in 2013, and almost 220 million in 2012, according to the company's transparency report.

In any case, the researchers told Mashable that internet users should be wary of being too open with their credit card details online.

'You do not know where you are going to end up,' they explained. 

'In many cases, your credit card is at risk, thanks to obscure payment systems backed by companies you have no idea who they are.'
