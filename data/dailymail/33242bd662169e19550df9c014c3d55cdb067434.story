HOLY CONGRESS: Pope Francis will become the first Pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress in September

COMING TO THE EAST COAST: On Wednesday the pope held his weekly 'general audience' in the Vatican, and thousands showed up

Six million people turned out in Manila to worship at a Mass celebrated by the pope during his visit last month to the Philippines

'Whether inspired by St. Francis of Assisi, who cared for all of God’s creation, or by St. Joseph, protector of the church, Pope Francis has lived his values and upheld his promise to be a moral force, to protect the poor and the needy, to serve as a champion of the less fortunate, and to promote love and understanding among faiths and nations,' Pelosi said then in a statement. 

Both Pelosi and Boehner are Catholics, although the top cardinal at the highest court in the Holy See has declared that Pelosi forfeited her right to take Communion because of her pro-abortion views.

Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke said Canon 915 states that Catholics who are stubbornly contrary 'in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.' 

Pope Francis has scheduled his first papal visit to the United States this fall, with stops in Washington, New York and Philadelphia.

In New York he will address a general session of the United Nations. President Obama plans to greet him at the White House. 

Throngs of Roman Catholics are expected to clog streets in all three cities to hear him speak. 

Last month in Manila, 6 million of the faithful came to a Mass the pope celebrated during his visit to the Philippines, which is 86 per cent Catholic.

There are 78.2 million baptized Catholics in the United States, or about a quarter of the population. Catholicism is America's most prevalent religious denomination.

SPEAKER'S DUTY: Boehner greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2011 before he spoke to Congress, and 'Bibi' is scheduled to return on March 3

Like John Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is a Catholic – but the top cardinal at the Vatican's highest court says she can't receive Communion because she's pro-abortion

The pope 'will become the first leader of the Holy See to address a joint meeting of Congress,' Boehner's statement said. 'It will be a historic visit, and we are truly grateful that Pope Francis has accepted our invitation.'

'In a time of global upheaval, the Holy Father's message of compassion and human dignity has moved people of all faiths and backgrounds,' the speaker said. 

'His teachings, prayers, and very example bring us back to the blessings of simple things and our obligations to one another.' 

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell added that 'the American people look forward to hearing Pope Francis’ call to love our neighbors and to find new and creative ways to meet the pressing needs of those who exist on the fringes of society.'

'From the slums of Buenos Aires to St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis is moving the hearts of millions and inspiring a new generation with an engaging and compelling style.'

The last U.S. papal visit came in 2008 when Pope Benedict XVI visited Washington and celebrated Mass at Nationals Stadium, a baseball park that seats nearly 42,000.
