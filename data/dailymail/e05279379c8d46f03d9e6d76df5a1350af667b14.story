The National Security Agency can listen to domestic phone calls without a warrant, according to a disclosure by Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, made during a briefing to members of Congress last Thursday.

Listening to phone calls without a warrant is illegal - but according to Mr Nadler, the NSA does not obtain a warrant to listen to calls.

Nadler said during the briefing that he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed 'simply based on an analyst deciding that.'

Disclosure: Representative Jerrold Nadler has called into question the nature and legality of the NSA's operations in the U.S.

If the NSA wants 'to listen to the phone,' an analyst's decision is sufficient, without any other legal authorization required, Nadler said he was informed.

'I was rather startled,' said Nadler, an attorney and congressman who serves on the House Judiciary committee.

It was an exchange that took place between Nadler
 and FBI director Robert Mueller at the briefing on Thursday that some 
have taken to indicate the NSA illegally listens to U.S. phone calls.

Mueller claimed that, to listen to a phone call, the government would need to 
seek 'a special, a particularized order from the FISA court directed at 
that particular phone of that particular individual.'

Access: According to Nadler, he was told that the NSA could 'listen to the phone' at an individual analyst's discretion

Nadler asked whether information about that procedure was 'classified in any way?' 

'I don't think so,' Mueller replied.

'Then I can say the following,' Nadler said. 'We heard precisely the 
opposite at the briefing the other day. We heard precisely that you 
could get the specific information from that telephone simply based on 
an analyst deciding that... In other words, what you just said is 
incorrect. So there's a conflict.'

Nadler's statement is causing some, such as CNET, to claim an admission of illegal wiretapping by the NSA.

The ambiguity of the phrase 
'information from that telephone' has caused others to argue that Nadler 
didn't understand the previous briefing that he cited as being proof of 
illegal surveillance.

Mother Jones
 suggests that 'information from that telephone' could mean one of many 
things, and that Nadler may have been 'confusing the ability of an 
analyst to get subscriber information for a phone number with the 
ability to listen to the call itself.'

Support: These latest allegations about the NSA's operations seem to support the claims made by Edward Snowden about the NSA's surveillance of U.S. citzens

The disclosure could confirm some of the allegations made by Edward
 Snowden, the former NSA infrastructure analyst who leaked classified 
documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post, who is now in hiding in Hong Kong.

Snowden said in a video interview that, while
 not all NSA analysts had this ability, he himself could, from Hawaii, 'wiretap 
anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president.'

By law, NSA's intelligence gathering is limited to foreign 
communications. The NSA's mission, as set forth in Executive Order 12333, is
 to collect information that constitutes 'foreign intelligence or 
counterintelligence' while not 'acquiring information concerning the 
domestic activities of United States persons'.

The same legal standards that apply to phone calls also apply to e-mail messages, text messages, and instant messages.

The NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on 
foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the USA, while 
confining its own activities within the USA to the embassies and 
missions of foreign nations.

CNET reports
 that this latest revelation 'suggests the Justice Department has 
secretly interpreted federal surveillance law to permit thousands of 
low-ranking analysts to eavesdrop on phone calls'.

Mission: The National Security Agency's surveillance is limited to gathering information on foreign communications

Wlliam Binney, a former NSA technical director who helped to modernize the agency's worldwide eavesdropping network, told theÂ Daily Caller
 this week that the NSA records the phone calls of 500,000 to one 
million people who are on its so-called target list, and perhaps even 
more. 'They look through these phone numbers and they target those and 
that's what they record,' Binney said.

A
 requirement of the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is that 
the NSA 'may not intentionally 
target any person known at the time of acquisition to be located in the 
United States.'

According to CNET, legal experts say a 'possible 
interpretation of that language is that the agency may vacuum up 
everything it can 
domestically - on the theory that indiscriminate data acquisition was 
not intended to target a specific American citizen.'

NSA
 Director Keith Alexander said this week that his agency's analysts 
abide by the law.

'They do this lawfully. They take compliance 
oversight, protecting civil liberties and privacy and the security of 
this nation to their heart every day.'
