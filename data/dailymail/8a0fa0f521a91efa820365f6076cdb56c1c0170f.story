Parents are looking to the early twentieth century and to prominent tourist landmarks as inspiration for baby names.

Social researchers say parents are looking to that era because of a generational trend, while using landmarks is also on the rise, reports The Australian.

Parents are looking to the early twentieth century and to prominent Australian landmarks as inspiration for baby names

Social researcher Mark McCrindle believes names reach a saturation point in different eras, at which point parents look to other eras for inspiration

5. Jackson

The spike in names like Byron, Brighton and Bronte represent the shift towards naming infants after local tourist attractions.

Oliver, William and Jack are among the most top expected names for boys, while Charlotte, Olivia and Ava are at the top for girls-all prominent names from a century ago, according to the NSW registry for Births, Deaths and Marriages.

Social researcher Mark McCrindle believes it is the result of a rotating pattern.

‘If you look at the top 10 boys’ names of the 1990s, none of them are in the top 10 today and there is only one for girls,’ he said.

‘A parent won’t usually adopt a baby name they heard a lot growing up but they will jump a generation and so you get this 100-year return,’ he said.

Mr McCrindle believes that names reach a saturation point in different eras, at which point parents look to other eras for inspiration.
