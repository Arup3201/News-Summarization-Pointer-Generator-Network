Apple's iPhone 7 could have a dramatically improved camera that uses two lenses to capture images rivalling those from professional cameras, it has been claimed.

Highly regarded Apple blogger John Gruber said sources at Apple have spoken of 'the biggest ever camera jump' for the next version of the hugely successful iPhone.

The handset is expected to be revealed in September.

The new handset could use two camera lenses to create pictures that rival snaps from a professional camera, it has been claimed.

The iPhone 6 featured a new 8-megapixel iSight camera.

It included autofocus with Focus Pixels to improve quality, optical image stabilization (iPhone 6 Plus only) and a True Tone flash.

The tip was revealed by Gruber in the latest episode of The Talk Show podcast, when he revealed he has heard 'from a birdie of a birdie' that Apple is working on the 'biggest camera jump ever' for the next iPhone.

'The specific thing I heard is that next years camera might be the biggest camera jump ever,' he said.

'I don't even know what sense this makes, but I've heard that it's some kind of weird two-lens system where the back camera uses two lenses and it somehow takes it up into DSLR quality imagery.'

HTC's most recent phone, the M8, also comes with two lenses so that you can add 3-D effects to photos. 

However, Apple's approach is believes to be designed to add quality to pictures rather than create special effects.

In the iPhone 6, there have been a whole host of technical improvements to the camera sensor, and in MailOnline's review, we said 'but in a nutshell, this is among the best cameras on any smartphone - and a huge leap forward from what was already a great camera in the iPhone 5.'

The iPhone 6 offered a major improvement in camera quality- but the iPhone 7 promises an ever bigger leap.

Both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus cameras feature 'focus pixels' which let the auto focus work twice as fast, and be capable of taking 43 Megapixel panoramic photos.

There is a dedicated hardware system within handset's A8 processor which will enable fast advanced face detection, and the larger 6 Plus has a new optical image stabilisation system.

The smaller iPhone 6 will still come with a digital image stabiliser.

The slow-motion video camera can take up to 240 frames a second, and allows you to slow footage down and speed it back up again at will.
