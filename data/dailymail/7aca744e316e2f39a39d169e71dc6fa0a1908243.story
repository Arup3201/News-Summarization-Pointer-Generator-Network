A wealthy British expat described as a ‘sex obsessed Jekyll and Hyde narcissist’ was last night sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder and rape.

Robert Dolby, a 74-year-old originally from Romford, Essex, was also portrayed as a ‘lying pervert’ before his conviction at the Alpes-Maritimes Assizes in Nice, in the south of France.

He was found guilty of killing a woman he invited to dinner in 2010, and also of sexually assaulting and then trying to kill another victim in 2012.

All of the crimes are said to have taken place in Dolby’s flat in Beausoleil, the Riviera resort town just outside Monaco, and at another apartment nearby.

The former cook was convicted of murdering Annie-Claude Chevalier, 68, in 2010 by administering a powerful sedative.

Dolby was also found guilty of and raping and attempting to murder a 31-year old woman, whose full name cannot be published for legal reasons, two years later.

The jury followed the prosecuting judge's call for a 30-year sentence, 15 of them without remission.

Dolby’s name will also remain on France’s sex offenders list, and he will be expelled from the country the moment he is released from prison.

On February 25 2012, a 29-year-old Frenchwoman identified only as Cindy was found nude in the Beausoleil apartment block, with her nose broken, and covered in blood and bruises.

‘Dolby tried to kill me,’ Cindy told investigators, confirming she had met her alleged attacker in the bar of a Monte Carlo hotel.

When police began to investigate Cindy’s complaint, they uncovered evidence linking Dolby with the murder in 2010.

It was in that year that the murder took place in Dolby’s former home in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, close to Beausoleil.

A court-appointed psychologist described Dolby as having a ‘Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde character’, acting like a relaxed charmer one minute, and then turning into a murderous, 'grinning sex-crazed ‘monster’.

Dolby also continually lied about his previous convictions, including ones in Britain.

Julie Rouillard, advocate general of the Assizes, said: ‘We’re not talking about an aged man whose past acts have caught up with him, but a predator still on the loose at 72 years old.’

Dolby, who was in jail on remand for two years, was also described as a ‘cold pervert who lies about everything.’

He retired to the sun-soaked south of France in 2005 with his wife, who died of cancer in 2009.

In 1991 Dolby was sentenced to four years in prison in the UK for sexually assaulting a colleague he invited to dinner.

He also has more than a dozen previous convictions, mostly for theft and burglary. Another psychiatrist said Dolby displayed signs of ‘narcissistic perversion’, and was capable of throwing out ‘seductive hooks’ while at the same time being ‘emotionally anaesthetised, and very cold’.
