Authorities have identified the mother of two toddlers who were found wandering alone on Thursday morning on a street in Long Beach, California

A relative of the children got in touch with police and named Shenae Irene Dixon, 23, to be the mom of the boys, who were left unaccompanied. 

Police released a photo of Dixon and have asked for the public's help in locating her. 

She is described as African-American, 5 feet 5 inches, 150 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.

Relatives also told police that they saw a social media post from someone claiming to be Dixon.

It stated she was concerned because she knew police were looking for her.

'We really don't know much at all. There was a post on Facebook early this morning, or Instagram, some kind of social media that we haven't been able to confirm yet. So that's what we're actively investigating right now to see if we can confirm that,' Sgt. Robert Woods reports.

Surveillance video from a liquor store near the location where the boys were discovered showed them walking with an unidentified woman on the sidewalk of Atlantic Avenue about 8:45 a.m.

Minutes later, the African-American boys, aged about one and two years old, were found alone by Amber Revels, a passerby.

Ms. Revels said the children were soiled with urine at the time, and that responding police officers purchased new diapers for them.

Police said the African American boys appeared to be in good health but were unsure exactly how long they had been without supervision.

The older child was found wearing a brightly colored Incredible Hulk themed t-shirt, shorts and sandals, while the younger boy was wearing a stripey t-shirt and diaper.

Police said: 'Witnesses in the immediate area were interviewed but no one was seen with the children or dropping them off.

'The area was searched for any possible video but none was found. A two-block area was also canvassed, however, no one recognizing the children was located.'

However, security camera footage from a nearby liquor did show the two toddlers wandering down the sidewalk, KTLA5 reported.
