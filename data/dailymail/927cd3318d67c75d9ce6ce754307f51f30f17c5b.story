The sandwich is made up of a 14-inch pork tenderloin, Angus steak burger, slabs of Texas brisket, applewood bacon and fried cheese, finished wth buffalo chicken tenders.

It is then smothered in melted cheddar cheese and white chedder sauce and comes with a side.

The monster sandwich has a warning attached: 'This could hurt you!' and a price tag of $24.95.

The Adam Emmenecker comes in at around 6,000 calories.

Mrs Schuyler, from Bellevue, Nebraska, told desmoinesregister.com: 'I tried to swallow most of it all. If it’s soft you can just swallow it.'

She said that her technique was 'divide and conquer'.

The mother-of-four became the first woman to complete the sandwich challenge in 2012 and has eaten the mammoth meal another four times since.

The eating feat came just two days after Mrs Schuyler, a waitress, devoured 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes at a competitive eating contest in Philadelphia, the Wing Bowl 22.
