It is one of the great mysteries: who was the couple kissing outside the Hotel de Ville?

The image captured by revered photographer Robert Doisneau at the close of the Second World War became a postcard for an era.

Now, around 70 years later, a French-American man has unveiled himself as one half of the passionate duo in 1940s Paris, claiming it was a spontaneous embrace. 

Mystery solved? An 87-year-old man in Los Angeles claims to be the man in Robert Doisneau's photograph Le baiser de l'hotel de ville (Kiss by the Hotel de Ville) shot in Paris at the close of the Second World War

However, his declaration comes two decades after the photographer told a court the image was set up in response to a French actress who unsuccessfully sued for a share of the royalties. 

Marc de Mauregne, who now resides in Los Angeles, insists he is right.

'I recognized myself, my hair,' the 87-year-old told Coleman-Rayner news agency, according to the New York Post. 

'I think we were going to the movies. The lady was a friend who used to live in my street in Paris. Her name was Rolande Dupuis. 

Marc de Mauregne, who now lives in Los Angeles, insists he is right and says: 'I was amazed to see the photo everywhere around the world'

Marc, pictured in his Los Angeles home his wife, Carol De Mauregne, says he has taken his family back to Paris to see the spot that made him famous

Unveiled? Marc de Mauregne, who moved to the U.S. in 1950, claims he spontaneously kissed his girlfriend on their way to the cinema. He insists he recognizes his hair in the shot although Doisneau said it was a model

'Memories': Mr de Mauregne (pictured with his wife Carol) said he has not heard from his then-girlfriend since

'She was a very good friend of my sister. They worked together and we were seeing each other for a couple of years. 

'I was amazed to see the photo everywhere around the world.' 

He said he was heading to the movies with his girlfriend of two years in 1945 when he turned to plant the world famous kiss. 

'You can see it is not posed,' he said.

Dispute: French actress Francoise Bornet unsuccessfully sued Doisneau for $18,000 and royalties in the early 1990s - prompting the photographer to reveal the shot was staged

'We were just walking and kissing and somebody took the picture. It's so popular in Paris. 

'Everybody just kisses on the street. It's a common thing over there.

'It was taken in probably '45 or '46 right after the war, in Paris, near the opera. It was a very popular corner and place.'

The shot was used by Life magazine in 1950 before sweeping the world in 1986 when Doisneau gave permission for it to be turned into a poster.  

Two years later, de Mauregne - who is now married with children - moved to the United States and has not heard from his former lover since.  

'We had a wonderful time. It brings back great memories.' 

Doisneau was taken to court shortly before his death in 1994 by a couple - including actress Francoise Bornet - who claimed they were the ones photographed in the shot.

However, once the case was underway Doisneau dramatically revealed that he had staged the shot with two models.

The court dismissed the case.

Doisneau's specialty was street photographer. 

But when he started out as a teenager he was so shy that he would only take pictures of street cobbles.

However, by the time Doisneau was 20 he was already a professional photographer. 

Many of his best images were taken after returning from service in the French Army from 1940 - 1945 in the Second World War.

He won a string of accolades before dying aged 81 on April 1, 1994, in Montrouge, Paris.
