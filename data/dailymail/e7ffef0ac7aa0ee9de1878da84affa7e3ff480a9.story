What is it about lacy lingerie that lures celebrities into thinking they can become fashion experts overnight?

From Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for Marks & Spencer, to Kelly Brook for New Look, scores of famous faces are adding ‘lingerie designer’ to their CVs — despite little or no prior knowledge of the rag trade.

But are their designs any good? We asked fabric expert Mairwen Jones, who has worked as a technologist for M&S and model Lauren McAvoy, who wears size 10 knickers and a 34C bra, to blind-test some celeb smalls . . .

BRITNEY SPEARS

Triangle bra, £32, and briefs, £19, asos.com

Mairwen says: Not bad. Simply made, well-finished and the fabric feels soft. This would be impractical for anyone over a size B cup as it would provide little support.

6/10

Lauren says: I love how chic and elegant it looks. I would never guess this was Britney’s design — surely it should be luminous pink?

KELLY BROOK - 15/20

Kelly Brook long line bra, £16.99, and Brazilian briefs, £7.99, newlook.com

Mairwen says: A well put- together set. The bra has wide mesh side-panelling with extra boning for support. The fabric ends appear to have been cut by hand, which is preferable as there’s less material that could scratch.

8/10

Lauren says: The bottoms are ill-fitting and creased, but the bra is better. Well-structured, it felt like scaffolding for my chest! The cup padding is generous, which larger busts may not like.

SADIE FROST

Floozie by Frost French. T-shirt bra, £16.50, and briefs, £6.50, debenhams.com

Mairwen says: The underwire was a little rigid, so this might be uncomfortable. There was also a horribly messy join in the stitching on the briefs. 5/10

Lauren says: I can’t imagine anyone over 20 wearing this set, the frills on the knickers would annoy me and show through tight clothing. It fits well, though, and the cups were the perfect size and shape. 7/10

DITA VON TEESE

Bra, £42, and briefs, £25, figleaves.com

Mairwen says: Good attention to detail. Labels are the same colour as the fabric, and there’s a well-fastened, antique-style cameo between the cups. A few messy threads and the lace looks a bit fragile. Minor details, though. 7/10

Lauren says: Turquoise and brown is unusual, but it feels sexy and wearable. It fits perfectly and gives the perfect amount of cleavage. 9/10

HELENA CHRISTENSEN

Dusky glow bra, £75, and briefs, £50, triumph.com

Mairwen says: The thick band on the knickers is insubstantial. After a few washes, it would sag. On the shoulder strap, they’ve used similar elastic, but reinforced it. Why did they forget about the briefs? 5/10

Lauren says: Elastic on the bra, rather than underwire, held firm, as did the knicker elastic for the time being. The oversized briefs feel like a nappy and the giant bows would show through clothes. 6/10

ELLE MACPHERSON

Elle Macpherson intimates contour bra, £38, and briefs, £23, figleaves.com

Mairwen says: This looks cheap. The bow ends on bra and briefs were uneven (by 0.5 and 1.5cm respectively); the underwire felt stiff; the lace was scratchy, the label at the back wasn’t attached tidily. Black labels in light-coloured sets also shows little care for design. 4/10

Lauren says: Eek! The bra cups were too small, meaning I spilt ungracefully over the top. The back strap dug in and the knickers felt scratchy. Not my favourite set. 4/10

8/20

ROSIE HUNTINGTON-WHITELEY

Rosie for Autograph plunge bra, £25, and knickers, £12.50, marksandspencer.com

Mairwen says: Clearly the best of the lot, the fabric and finish is exceptional. No loose ends, beautifully soft, stretchy lace. The fabric has been treated to keep it supple, and flat-locked stitching on the knickers stops threads sticking out or rubbing. Someone knows what they are doing. 10/10

Lauren says: I liked the romantic, neutral colour, and the bra had subtle seams and pleats that wouldn’t be visible underneath a T-shirt. But the pants were baggy and wrinkled unflatteringly — I’d have to go down a size. 8/10
