A four-year-old was hit and killed by a train at a level crossing because her grandmother could not see the dim warning lights.

A year-long investigation was launched after Emma Lifsey's death at the junction near Finningley in South Yorkshire on December 4.

Today, a report presented to the government ruled the road traffic signals - known as wig-wags - were well below the specified brightness.

Emma Lifsey was four when her grandmother drove over a level crossing into the way of a 60mph train

The girl's 67-year-old grandmother told a panel she did not notice the lights and barriers at the automatic crossing until she was driving past them in her silver Volvo.

The pair, from Haxey, North Yorkshire, were crushed by an East Midlands train going at 60mph.

Local residents rescued them from the wreckage.

Although Emma was taken to a specialist unit Sheffield Children's Hospital by air ambulance, she died from her injuries that night.

Her grandmother survived with severe neck injuries, treated at Doncaster Royal Infirmary.

No one on the train was hurt.

Today's report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) blasted Network Rail for failing to notice the discrepancy.

It states the weather was sunny at the time of the lunch-time collision but there had been rain showers earlier and the road surface was wet, leading to glare from the low winter sun.

The report went on: 'The RAIB took the wig-wag units and arranged for testing in an optical laboratory.

'It was found that they were fitted with 36W lamps and an obsolete design of red lens unit.

'Their light output was measured to be well below the specification for lights of this type.

'Network Rail had no plans in place to replace the light units with brighter ones and had no process to identify that such replacement was necessary.'

The RAIB said infrastructure managers should make it a priority to determine which level crossings are fitted with weak 36W lamps and draw up plans to replace them with a new 'brighter' type of LED wig-wag.

Change: The government will now consider bringing in new laws for the method of blocking level crossings

A method should also be devised to assess the risk of a bright background and glare obscuring wig-wag signals, the report added.

The report came on the same day as the publication of a joint study by the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission.

It makes recommendations to for law changes that will clarify rights of way across railways.

The report also suggests devising a new way of closing level crossings and improving the general safety regime.

Speaking after the incident, Emmaâ€™s parents, Mark and Zoe Lifsey, aged 40 and 38, said: 'Emma meant the world to us. She was our 
much-loved daughter and a baby sister to her 11-year-old brother Jack.

'We
 are still trying to come to terms with the terrible incident on Tuesday
 afternoon and there are no words that can properly express how utterly 
distraught we are.

'We would like to thank everyone for the many messages of sympathy and support we have received.

'As
 you can appreciate, this tragic incident has left us shocked and 
devastated.'
