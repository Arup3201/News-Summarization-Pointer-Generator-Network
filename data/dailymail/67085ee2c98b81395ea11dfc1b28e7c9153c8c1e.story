From Victoria Beckham adding bee pollen to her daily smoothies to Miranda Kerr crediting noni juice for her flawless complexion, superfoods are the hippest way to stay healthy.

According to the British Dietetic Association (BDA), 61 per cent of people have purchased a food just because it had been labelled a ‘superfood’ - M&S has even introduced a chia seed range - including bread and pitta – containing the ingredient to meet the rising demand. 

So popular are superfoods that Europe's first-ever bar dedicated to superfood cocktails has opened its doors and the new range of tasty tipples may even hinder a hangover.

Tanya's Cafe, located within the MyHotel in Chelsea, was the brainchild of raw food specialist and wellness coach, Tanya Maher.

At the age of 14, a near-fatal car crash left Tanya with damaged organs. Going against medical advise to remove her pancreas, her parents chose a holistic path to save what traditional medicine couldn't. 

Tanya's realisation of the power of raw food became the catalyst for her career and her new cafe serves up delicious raw food, as well as an array of superfood cocktails.

Speaking to MailOnline about her bar, which mixes organic spirits with only superfoods and cold-pressed juices, Tanya said: 'The menu is designed to reflect your busy schedule and provide loving nourishment at all times of the day. 

'You can get your morning green juice, which is cold pressed and organic or a pour over coffee with hazelnut milk, a satisfyingly delicious plant-based burger and decadent raw chocolate cake for lunch, then come evening you could share a vibrant cashew cheese platter and superfood packed cocktails, that are made with only top quality, vegan and ethically sourced alcohol. 

'Everything is organic, hand picked and raw.'

Will it help YOUR hangover? Tanya's Cafe, located within the myhotel in Chelsea, was the brainchild of raw food specialist and wellness coach Tanya Maher and serves up juices like this called what the doctor ordered: a combination of vodka, lemon, beets, carrot, sweet potato, raw honey, ginger and lavender bitter and chia seeds

Tasty tipples: Other cocktails on offer include a combination of walnut infused vodka, fresh cherries, cacao powder, acai berry, vanilla bitter and maple syrup, as well as cachaca shaken up with lime, coconut palm sugar and maca powder, well known for its energy boosting properties

Brains behind the brand: Tanya was seriously injured in a car crash in her teens and the realisation of the power of raw food became the catalyst for her career and her new cafe serves up delicious raw food, as well as an array of superfood cocktails

One of her most popular requests is a drink called 'what the doctor ordered': a combination of vodka, lemon, beets, carrot, sweet potato, raw honey, ginger, lavender bitter and chia seeds.

Originally found in Mexico, the tiny seeds have been dubbed ‘the running food’ and hailed as the ‘ultimate superfood’ by athletes and health advocates.

They contain a wealth of antioxidants and minerals such as calcium and have higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids than salmon. Omega-3 has been shown to help protect against a range of illnesses including heart disease and dementia. 

The seeds are also thought to help dieters as they contain few calories but are high in protein, making people feel full. And now, bartenders are claiming they may well help your hangover too.

Green living: At Tanya's, you can get your morning green juice, which is cold pressed and organic or a pour over coffee with hazelnut milk, a plant-based burger and raw chocolate cake for lunch, then come evening you could share a vibrant cashew cheese platter and superfood packed cocktails - she even uses edible stinging nettles and plants to decorate her meals

'They hold around 10 times their weight in water so they help beat dehydration, which is what causes hangovers,' said  one of Tanya's mixologists. 

Other cocktails on offer include a combination of walnut infused vodka, fresh cherries, cacao powder (packed with antioxidants and magnesium), acai berry (used by athletes for stamina), vanilla bitter and maple syrup, as well as cachaca shaken up with lime, coconut palm sugar and maca powder, well known for its energy boosting properties

So are the cocktails, which cost around £10, too good to be true?

Tipper Lewis, Head Herbalist at Neal’s Yard Remedies, said: 'Promoting good health while drinking alcohol may seem counterproductive, however by adding superfoods to the mix it offers a revolutionary healthy spin on some of our most celebratory drinks. 

'By using the most nutrient-dense ingredients nature has to offer - superfoods - you can transform even the most empty calorie cocktails into health-boosting mixtures packed full of antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. 

'There are superfoods for every season, and the accessibility of superfoods makes superfood cocktails readily available for even the novice bartender. Since there is always an in-season option, finding innovative ingredients with health giving benefits for cocktails is a breeze.'

The menu: A spokesperson for Neal's Yard Remedies, who stock the kind of superfoods Tanya uses, said: 'Promoting good health while drinking alcohol may seem counterproductive, however by adding superfoods to the mix it offers a revolutionary healthy spin on some of our most celebratory drinks'
