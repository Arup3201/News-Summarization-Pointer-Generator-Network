Two long-lost brothers have been reunited for the first time in an incredible 80 years after they were fostered to different families as babies.

Ron Boyes, 83, was sent to Heage in Derbyshire when he was three, while his brother, Fred, 80, was taken in by a family in Banbury, Oxfordshire, when he was a baby.

But despite living 87 miles apart, they led remarkably similar lives.

One big family again: Long-lost brothers Fred, centre left, and Ron Boyes, centre right, are surrounded by their family having been reunited for the first time in an incredible 80 years

Both enlisting with the RAF at 18, 
reaching the same rank of leading aircraftman, playing on the right wing
 for their football teams, both marrying, and both naming a daughter 
Wendy.

The pair, who are now pensioners and RAF veterans, were reunited in Belper, Derbyshire, after a relative did research into their family tree.

The brothers were both speechless when they came face to face and simply gave each other a huge hug.

Fred said: 'It was a very emotional meeting. When we finally got talking, it sparked other things off and then we talked all day.'

The siblings left their home in Exeter in 1933, although no one knows exactly why they were fostered.

Back together: Fred Boyes, left, and Ron Boyes, were fostered by two different families 80 years ago but were reunited after a relative started researching their family tree

Fred was initially taken in by the Salvation Army and it is thought Ron went to St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.

His
 family have seen a cutting from The News of The World at the time, 
appealing for foster parents to take in children, and one of the 
youngsters pictured was Ron.

They were brought up under their foster parents' names and were unaware of their true identities.

The men first discovered they had been fostered when they joined the air force.

Ron was at the time known by the name of Gotheridge and Fred by Geecock.

But they needed their birth certificates to enrol and realised they had been born to Rose Boyes in Exeter.

Fred said: 'We have no idea why our mother gave us up.'

After leaving the RAF, Ron moved to Belper and in the late 1960s decided to find out more about his birth family, by visiting the address in Exeter.

Wendy Miles, Ron's daughter, said: 'They explained what information they had and they were asked in.

'He met Rose but to begin with she kept denying that she had had him. Eventually she said yes but only after she learned where they lived.'

Ron was employed in the textile trade, working at the Stevenson Dye Works while Fred settled in Oxfordshire and set up his own contract cleaning company.

Both men married, Fred to Gene and Ron to Margaret, and had children.

Both are now great-grandfathers.

Wendy said that the urge to find his birth family never left Ron and he often spoke of it. As his health began to deteriorate, he moved in with her.

Fred had been contacted by a foster family member who had been researching the family history.

Fred said: 'This chap, called Albert, had been doing some family history research and had spoken to my foster family in 1986. But they had never told him that I was adopted.

'Somehow he got that information and gave me the number for what turned out to be Wendy's ex-husband. I gave them a call and once I got through to Wendy we arranged to meet.'

Wendy said: 'We had told my dad Ron that it might be too late to find his family. So when we got the call from Fred it was amazing.'

The brothers eventually met this month with members of their extended families.

Fred said: 'This isn't the end. We're still looking for another brother who believe was also fostered and we think there was a brother who also died in the war.'
