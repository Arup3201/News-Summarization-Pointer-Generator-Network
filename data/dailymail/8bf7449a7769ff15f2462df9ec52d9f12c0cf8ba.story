Critical: David Sproul, CEO of Deloitte, says the government's attitude on tax is putting businesses off

Trying to force companies to pay their fair share of tax is damaging the economy – according to the boss of Deloitte, which makes millions by helping clients to avoid tax.

David Sproul, the firm’s chief executive, said businesses were discouraged from moving to the UK by MPs’ mixed messages on tax.

He called for politicians to stop ‘playing to the gallery’ on the issue.

The comments follow a series of lively hearings of the Public Accounts Committee, which saw MPs savage companies such as Amazon and Google for aggressively avoiding tax by exploiting legal loopholes.

Mr Sproul, who was paid £2.7million last year, highlighted corporation tax cuts.

‘On the one hand, you’ve got a government pursuing a tax strategy to make the UK one of the most competitive regimes,’ he said.

‘But then you’ve got a push by the PAC and by others to say, separate to that, “We want to make sure everyone’s paying their fair share of tax and we’ll determine what that fair share of tax is”.’

The Government has launched a consultation on the clampdown on tax avoidance, and firms who promote such schemes could be fined up to £1million.

There will also be measures to loosen the market stranglehold of the ‘big four’ audit firms – Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and Ernst & Young.

'Mixed messages' : Mr Sproul says that companies are being encouraged to come to the UK with low corporation tax but then giants like Starbucks and Amazon are criticised for using legal tax loopholes

Deloitte yesterday revealed that its revenues have increased 8 per cent to £2.5billion.

Dave Hartnett, the former HMRC boss who was criticised for cutting tax deals with big firms, recently joined the company as a consultant.

Mr Sproul also defended Deloitte’s audit of Royal Bank of Scotland before its near-collapse, which was criticised for being too optimistic.

‘An audit is a review of financial statements. It isn’t an assessment of the business model,’ he said.
