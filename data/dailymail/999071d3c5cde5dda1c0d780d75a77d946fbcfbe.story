Enda Kenny, Ireland's Prime Minister, lead the campaign to abolish the upper house of Parliament and defeat in the referendum today will be seen as a personal embarrassment

Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny has admitted he is personally disappointed after his Government suffered 'a wallop' in a referendum to abolish the country's upper house of parliament.

Almost 52% of the public voted to keep the Seanad, in what was an embarrassing and damaging blow to Mr Kenny, who spearheaded a campaign to scrap it.

The No side emerged victorious with a margin of just 42,500 votes.

Mr Kenny said: 'Sometimes in politics you get a wallop in the electoral process. I accept the verdict of the people.'

The Taoiseach added that he welcomed the clarity of the public in what was the ultimate exercise of democracy.

'Naturally I am personally disappointed but I fully accept and respect the outcome,' said Mr Kenny.

The Taoiseach said the Government would now reflect on how to reform the upper house to make sure it can contribute to Irish politics in 'a meaningful way'.

He insisted he had stuck with a promise he made four years ago to put the question of abolishing the Seanad to the people.

'The Seanad question was one element of a process of change and reform to politics that Government has been pursuing,' Mr Kenny added.

'Now that the people have made their decision and that they have decided and confirmed that the Seanad is retained as part of our constitution intuitions, I must now reflect upon what the best way that that can be made an effective contributor to the change in politics which I intend to continue within the Dail and in the wider sphere.'

Elsewhere, Mr Kenny welcomed the outcome of a second referendum, in which 65.29% of the Irish public voted to create a Court of Appeal.

Kenny first announced his intention to scrap the second chamber in 2009 when he was the leader of the opposition.

During his campaign, he insisted the public is faced with only two choices - abolishing the Seanad, or retaining it.

The Irish Parliament is currently made up of the upper Seanad and the Dail (pictured). The referendum would have abolished the upper house and handed all power to the lower

He argued that abolition would create a leaner, more effective and more accountable political system.

He called the 75-year-old institution elitist, undemocractic and promised its abolition would save money.

Advocates for the senate, including the main opposition party Fianna Fail, accused the government of a power grab.

Kenny's party, Fine Gael, and junior coalition partner Labour were supported by opposition party Sinn Fein in their campaign.

Opponents, led by the largest opposition party, Fianna Fail, successfully argued thatÂ  the Seanad is necessary to serve as a watchdog and to hold the ruling Cabinet ministers to account.

The Irish parliament, the Oireachtas, is currently made up of the lower house, the Dail, from which Government operates, and the upper house, the Seanad - where poet William Butler Yeats once sat.

The 60 members of the Senate, many of whom have jobs outside of politics, have only limited powers such as the ability to temporarily delay legislation, much like England's House of Lords.

The country's last referendum on children's rights, held in late 2012, saw a turnout of just 33%.
