They were already rivals on the political battlefield.

Yesterday, however, it emerged that there is more than just ideology standing between Liberal Democrat council leader Jeremy Hilton and Labour candidate Kevin Neal.

Mr Hilton, 57, is believed to have left his wife to set up home with Mr Neal’s partner, who is 24 years his junior.

The Lib Dem – who has twice failed to become an MP but is leader of both Gloucester city and Gloucestershire county councils – is understood to have moved out of the house he shared with his Chilean wife Polly, 53, after she found out about the affair.

For his part, Mr Neal, who plans to stand as a Labour candidate in his local council elections, revealed that he discovered his wife Rebecca Trimnell’s infidelity after she started taking more care over her appearance.

Miss Trimnell, who failed in her own bid to become a Lib Dem councillor last year, has been working for Mr Hilton for a year as a political researcher.

Mr Neal, 48, said: ‘I started having suspicions about three months ago. She was buying new dresses, wearing make-up, worrying about her hair, things like that. She told me she started having feelings for him about nine months ago and it really started about three months ago.’

He and Miss Trimnell, 33, have been married for eight years and have a seven-year-old daughter.

They moved from Plymouth to Gloucester last year so she could take up her job with Mr Hilton. The Hiltons have no children.

Speaking last night, Mr Neal, a 
horticulturalist, added: ‘I met Jeremy Hilton six or seven times and I 
did not like him from the start. But it is a two-way street – my wife is
to blame too. She’s the one that cheated on me.’

Moved out: After Mr Hilton's Chilean wife Polly found out about the infidelity with Miss Trimnell, 24 years his junior, he moved out

On his website, Mr Hilton describes 
his interests as ‘current affairs, swimming, travel, photography and 
family’. In his council role, he once led calls to save the register 
office where he married his wife, a homecare worker for the county 
council, describing it as ‘a very pleasant place’ for a wedding.

In his attempts to become an MP, Mr 
Hilton came third in 2005 and again in 2010, when Conservative candidate
Richard Graham unseated the sitting Labour candidate.

In an email address given on his 
website, however, the optimistic politician still describes himself as 
‘nextmp4gloucester’, calling himself a ‘truly local candidate’ who was 
born and educated in the city.

When asked about his affair Mr Hilton
said: ‘I have always made a point of not commenting in public on other 
people’s private matters. I don’t intend to comment on my own private 
life and those involved.’ 

But Mr Neal said: ‘He’s in a public position and people in that position of responsibility should be able to act responsibly.

‘I do not believe politicians having 
affairs is correct in this modern age. They are supposed to be setting 
an example. They should lead a proper life and not destroy families.’ 

Mr Neal will stand as a Labour 
candidate in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, next year. Last night he said 
he believed his estranged wife and Mr Hilton were staying together at a 
house belonging to another Lib Dem member.

Miss Trimnell said: ‘I cannot comment
as this is very much a personal and sensitive matter that needs to be 
dealt with rationally, reasonably and amicably. I would hope that anyone
who has or is going through any such relationship upheaval understands 
the need for privacy during this particular time.’ 

Mrs Hilton has not commented on her 
husband’s affair. Her neighbours in Gloucester said they had not seen 
her since details of the affair emerged.

One said: ‘It knocked her for six. I think she’s gone away to get some peace.

‘She’s devastated, I should expect. Especially because I don’t think she kicked him out, I think he left on his own.’ 

Another neighbour said: ‘Polly is one of the nicest people you would like to meet.’
