Boastful: Silvio Berlusconi was heard claiming he had bedded eight girls in one night

A lurid picture of Silvio Berlusconi's debauchery emerged today after he was heard boasting in bugged telephone calls of his sexual prowess and a preference for girls smaller than him.

The Italian Prime Minister was taped talking to a businessman who is charged with recruiting female escorts for his famous 'Bunga Bunga' sex parties at his mansion.

Berlusconi, who is 5 feet 5 inches tall, is heard asking Gianpaolo Tarantini 'not to bring tall [girls], as we are not tall.'

In another conversation, he boasts to 'having been with eight [girls] in one night, even though I could have had eleven.'

At one point, he reveals that there 
are 40 women staying in his house who just won't leave. In many others, 
he asks excitedly who the businessman will bring him next.

The transcript of the calls between 
Berlusconi and Tarantini are part of an investigation by magistrates looking
into the alleged prostitution ring surrounding Berlusconi.

In one of the calls Berlusconi jokingly promises to act as 'prime minister in his spare time.'

Most of wiretaps reveal inappropriate behaviour more suited to an over-excited teenager than a 74-year old leader of the third biggest country in Europe, according to MSNBC.

They led to the arrest of Tarantini, among others, on charges of aiding and abetting prostitution.

The investigation in the southern city of Bari, where Tarantini was based, includes about 100,000 wiretapped conversations, targeting eight people, including Tarantini, his brother and a woman nicknamed in the Italian media as 'Queen Bee' for her alleged role in recruiting women for the premier.

These women included high-class escorts, such as Patrizia D'Addario, the woman whose revelation that she spent the night with Berlusconi when Barack Obama was elected U.S. President exposed the premier's sex scandals. They also included some minor starlets and would-be starlets.

Tarantini 'persuaded them to prostitute themselves, or strengthened their initial resolve to prostitute themselves, during gatherings he organized at Silvio Berlusconi's residences,' said the document, obtained by Associated Press.

Prosecutors claim that between September 2008 and May 2009 Tarantini recruited women of 'young age, slender frame,' and told them what to wear and how to behave at the parties.

The telephone calls also raise fresh claims of Berlusconi’s abuse of office after he allowed Tarantini and a number of female 'friends' to use a presidential plane to join him while on an official trip to Milan.

The list of women mentioned in the telephone calls, most of whom attended the parties, is a Who's Who in the Italian entertainment business.

MSNBC said actresses, television starlets, aspiring weather-girls and glamour models have all gravitated to the prime minister in a system of apparently shameless patronage in exchange of sexual favours.

In one of the calls, Berlusconi tells Tarantini, who agreed to bring five girls with him for dinner in one of the prime minister's residences, that he would invite the president of his film distribution company and a director of RAI, Italy's state channel, so that 'the girls feel there's someone there who have the power to give them work.'

Tarantini has admitted paying scores of beautiful women to attend the prime minister's parties at his various mansions, but always denied Berlusconi knew they were sex workers, claiming he believed they were 'just friends.'

Magistrates in Naples are also looking into regular payments that Berlusconi made to Tarantini, amounting to up to $1 million.

Investigators believe they were part of an extortion plan by the businessman in exchange of his silence. But Berlusconi claims he gave the money to Tarantini to help 'a family in need.'

While officially the prime minister is the victim of the alleged blackmailing, he believes the magistrates are in fact out to get him, and has so far declined the offer to provide testimony.

On September 13, the day he was scheduled to meet the magistrates, he flew to Brussels for last-minute talks with European leaders over the financial crisis, prompting accusations he was  using Italy's economy downfall to escape justice.

The magistrates have now given him a deadline until tomorrow to give his testimony.

Should he fail to meet them, they said they will ask parliament for permission to have him brought to them by force - via police escort.

Berlusconi is already on trial in four separate cases in Milan on charges of corruption, tax fraud and paying for sex with a minor.
