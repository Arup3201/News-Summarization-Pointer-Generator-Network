The haunting signs of lives once lived still echo from every room in this long-abandoned ramshackle ruin.

Old Crow Cottage, a Grade II listed building, now stands eerily abandoned since 2009 - the clothes, pictures and other remnants from former inhabitants are untouched and lying under a thick layer of dust.

New photographs from inside the dilapidated cottage, in Willersley, Herefordshire, reveal the eerie atmosphere within the building which would once have been a family home.

Over the last few years, locals have even reported to have seen lights flickering inside the cottage, leading to rumours that the cottage might be haunted.

The last occupant was killed in a car crash on the road outside the home.

Urban explorer Dan Circa ventured inside after reading about its history online.

Dan, 28, from Manchester says: 'The 
cottage has been in the same family for many years and it looks like 
each generation has filled the house with their possessions.'

'Inside, there was everything you would find in a family home - from old photographs and clothes to beds and clocks.

'The longer I was inside the cottage the atmosphere felt more and more oppressive.'

The Old Crow Cottage can be found in historic records dating to as early as 17th century.

It appears the building was a pub or inn under a series of difference names.

But a local newspaper reports from 1841 show the occupant at the time was a Mr James Matthews.

But the 1851 census the owner had changed to Thomas Phillpots and his family. 

Two years after the census, tragedy struck the Philpotts family with the death of their eldest son Thomas, aged 33, on 22 October 1853.

Details of the occupants through much of the 19th century are sketchy.

But the last person thought to have lived in the Old Crow Cottage was David Edward Penny, 72, who died on Tuesday, October 22nd, 2013, after his car collided with a lorry on the road outside the house.

The crumbling cottage consists of seven rooms - one entirely burnt out from a fire and another completely collapsed.

Upstairs
 in one of the bedrooms, lay discarded clothes and empty shoe boxes - in
 another hangs framed portraits of what could have been residents who 
once inhabited the home.

Newspaper editions from the 1960s lay strewn 
across the burnt out floors offering a flashback to the past.

Dan says: 'I'm not a huge believer in ghosts, but at one point a small ornament fell over, as if it was pushed quickly.

'The cottage really is on its last legs, very structurally unsafe and could fall any day now.'

Built in the seventeenth century and originally named 'The Old Crow', the cottage has had many uses over the years.

Initially, the cottage was part of a farm, and then the property became a pub called 'The Crow Inn'.

Years later the pub was closed and the cottage turned into a mini brewery where beers and ciders were produced.

More recently, the cottage provided a 
backdrop to a horrific car accident that saw a 72-year-old man 
tragically killed in October 2013.

The victim of the crash is believed to be one of the cottage's last remaining residents named David Edward Penny.

According
 to local historical records, Mr Penny lived at the cottage with his two
 brothers Philip and John, but has since lay abandoned.

Dan says: 'I hope the cottage and the objects inside can be saved.

'The vast history is amazing and it should not be left to rot.

'I hope the current owner can fully restore it one day.

'The
 main reason I started urban exploring is because I love to capture the 
beauty that can be found in decaying buildings and objects inside.'

Anyone contemplating reviving The Old Crow's past as a guest house might be able to trade on its ghostly past.

But it would have to some way to vying with The Ancient Ram Inn for the title of Britain’s most haunted B&B.

The guesthouse, in the village of Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, is believed to be riddled with up to 20 spectres who torment the paying punters of the 12th century home.

Built on an ancient pagan burial ground - and also believed to be the scene of child sacrifices and devil worship - the Cotswolds cottage is haunted by the likes of a murdered young girl called Rosie, a high priestess, and even a male sex demon, known as an incubus.

The strange goings on include a blood-curdling child’s scream, ‘electrified’ wooden beams, and even the touch of an invisible force.

Caroline Humphries, whose family has lived in the Ram Inn for nearly 50 years, said: 'My father won’t go anywhere without his Bible.'

But despite its ghoulish reputation, Ms Humphries is inundated with visitors who are desperate to spend a night in Britain’s spookiest lodgings, which were built in 1145 and costs between £25 and £30 per night.

Past guests have fled from the house in the middle of the night after claiming to have seen furniture flying around the bedrooms, visions of a little girl wandering the hallways, and have even been pushed down onto a bed by a randy incubus.
