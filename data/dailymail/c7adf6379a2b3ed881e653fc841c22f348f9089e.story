One in five single mothers fall into poverty in the wake of a relationship break-up, research suggests

One in five single mothers fall into poverty in the wake of a break-up, new research suggests.

The study by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex found that women and children are those who are hit the hardest following the breakdown of a relationship.

Researchers, who analysed data from the British Household Panel Survey between 1991 and 2008, also found that 19 per cent of children fall into relative poverty after their parents split.

The study also found that mental health and life satisfaction declines for both men and women in the wake of a split.

However, while they return to pre-split levels in the short-term, women are left struggling in the long-term with income and living standards.

The study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, found that on average, it takes two to three years for a woman’s household income to return to its pre-split levels.

In comparison, on average, a man’s income rises by around 80 per cent at the time of a split and never falls back to pre-split levels.

Women's income is usually helped by meeting a new partner, the study found. 

The study’s authors, Professor  Mike Brewer and Dr Alita Nandi, said: ‘Women and dependent children, on average, see living standards fall more than men after a split.

‘These changes are much greater for those women and children from formerly high-income couples, because the loss of the man’s earnings is in no way compensated for by higher income from alimony, child maintenance, benefits and tax credits, and having fewer mouths to feed.

‘Our research suggests that partnership dissolution has relatively short-term adverse impacts on mental distress and subjective well-being, but can have long-term negative consequences for income and living standards.’

Fiona Weird, chief executive of Gingerbread – a charity providing advice and support to single parents – said the Government must ensure that the number of single parents struggling doesn’t fall any lower.

Both men and women experience a decline in mental health and life satisfaction in the wake of a break-up but while these return to pre-split levels in the short-term, women are left with lower income and living standards

She told The Observer: ‘This research chimes with what many of the single parents we work with tell us every day: that they are really struggling to pay essential bills and put food on the table.

She said that fewer than two in five of single parents– of whom nine out of 10 are mothers – received maintenance from their child’s other parent, something which she said needed to be addressed urgently.

‘The Government must ensure the changes it is making to the child maintenance system don’t see this figure fall even lower,’ she added.

The Government is currently examining whether family breakdown should be considered when measuring child poverty. A child is deemed as living in poverty if the family household income is less than 60 per cent of the average wage.
