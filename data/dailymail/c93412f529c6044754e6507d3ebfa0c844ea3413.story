Residents have been left baffled after bungling council workers put up a 20mph speed limit sign on a footpath.

The notice was put up by Nottingham City Council in the Radford area of the city as part of a £147,000 road safety scheme.

But the sign in Dulwich Road was placed at a dead end in front of a set of bollards, which enclose a pedestrian-only zone in the residential area.

Dorothy Francis, 89, who has lived in the area all her life, said: ‘It’s bizarre, you can barely even get a bicycle through the gap in those bollards never mind a car.

‘The sign is actually on the pavement, it’s not like it’s a few yards before, there would be no chance to get up to speed before you hit the bollards.

‘I know we old dears can hit some speed in our mobility scooters but this is taking it a bit too far.’

Another resident, Anne Simpson, 54, said: ‘I can’t believe it, I don’t think it’s the only place they have done something stupid like this either.

‘It cost money to put that up too, and it will never make any kind of difference.

‘What will they do next? Install a speed camera to make sure we don’t run too fast?’

Rich Holmes, 26, who also lives nearby, said: ‘It’s a bit daft.

‘You would have thought people would have common sense and not put the sign up with the bollards right there.’

A footpath is not the only place where residents claim a sign is not needed.

Another street nearby has a 20mph sign attached to a lamppost - but it is just a 45 metre stretch.

Darren Warner, 27, added: ‘It’s impossible to go that quick on these streets anyway, so what’s the point of the signs?’

A spokeswoman from Nottingham City Council said the sign was put up in error and it has now been removed

A Nottingham City Council spokeswoman confirmed the Dulwich Road sign was erected in error and said it has now been removed.

She said: ‘The scheme is still under construction and so the checks to pick up on issues like this are yet to be carried out.

‘Changes like this are implemented before speed limit orders come into effect.

‘20mph limits are being introduced in residential areas across the city and have been shown to bring a number of benefits, such as reduced traffic noise, safer junctions and improved air quality.’
