A TV anchor named after Amelia Rose Earhart plans to recreate the famous female pilot's 1937 attempt to fly around the world.

The 30-year-old Denver traffic and weather reporter announced the plan at the 2013 Aviation show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin yesterday with co-pilot Patrick Carter.

Rose Earhart, who recently discovered she was distantly related to her namesake, said she wanted to recreate the flight in order inspire adventure in others.

'Amelia Earhart said adventure is worthwhile in itself,' she told USA Today. 'Whatever your version of flying is - it could be starting a business, it could be something entrepreneurial - we want to encourage people to pursue their own adventure.'

The two will start their journey next June in Oakland, California, and spend about 100 hours tracing the 28,000 miles of Earhart's original flight. 

They'll be flying in a 2014 model PC-12 Pilatus Business Aircraft which will allow them to stay in the air longer, with only 14 planned stops.

Though the aircraft is more modern, 
the engine is manufactured by Pratt & Whitney - the same engine used
on Earhart's plane.

Another modern update to the trip is the fact that the two will be streaming their flight live.

The
two just completed eight days of full-motion simulators in Florida in 
preparation for next year's trip, dealing with everything that could go 
wrong during the flight - a serious consideration if they want to avoid 
the problems that happened in the original flight.

Around the world: Rose Earhart and her partner Patrick Carter announced the trip at an aviation show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin yesterday

Earhart was the world's first female pilot, and the first woman to fly woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932.

In 1937 she planned to fly around the world with navigator Fred Noonan, but disappeared on approach to Howland island on the final legs of the journey. The two were never see again.

If they are successful in their flight, Rose Earhart and Carter won't be the first to recreate the journey.

Anne Pellegreno completed the trip in 1967, and Gaby Kennard gave it another go in 1989.

Rose Earhart started taking flying lessons in June 2004, but had been an admirer of her namesake all of her life.

Namesake: Rose Earhart's mother wanted to give her daughter a name no one would forget

She said her mother gave her the same because she 'wanted me to have a name nobody would forget.'

Her mother was right.

'There hasn't been a day in my life that somebody hasn't said something to me about Amelia Earhart. It's a daily connection,' Rose Earhart said. 'People would always ask, "Are you a pilot? Are you a pilot?"'

Aviatrixes: Rose Earhart has long admired her famous namesake for her dedication to adventure

Rose Earhart even discovered that she was related to the aviatrix through shared lineage going back to the 1700s.

Her naming may have been destiny, since she too fell in love with flying. Rose Earhart earned her instrument rating about two months ago.

'The feeling I have when I get up there in the airplane is unlike anything else,' she said.

She plans to share her love of flying with her new organization, the Fly with Amelia Foundation which plans to give teach young girls 16-18 to fly and gain confidence.
