She's walked the runway for Marc Jacobs, showcased her curves for Agent Provocateur and even bagged a date with heartthrob Harry Styles - so what's Daisy Lowe's secret?

Well, the model is preparing to reveal how she eats her way to such an enviable physique in a new cookery book.

Sweetness & Light is a new 
collection of recipes for 60 healthy sweet treats.

By making simple changes to ingredients, such as using maple syrup 
rather than refined sugar, or discovering new ingredients like raw 
chocolate, Daisy promises that her recipes are transformed into something 'devilishly 
delicious' but 'angelically healthy'.

Domestic goddess: Model Daisy Lowe has penned a cookbook in which she shares her favourite healthy sweet treats

Speaking about the £15 book, which will hit shelves in July, Daisy said: 'This is the result of my journey to discover the craft of baking guilt-free delicious treats.

'I wanted to create a collection of recipes that ensure you can enjoy sweet things without harming your body.

'You’ll find recipes here to satisfy even the sweetest tooth. Many are gluten, dairy and refined sugar-free, some are vegan and others raw. Cook with love and make your body feel good.'

Sweet treats: Sweetness & Light features skinny puddings and healthy ice cream, which Daisy loves to cook at home herself

Split over seven chapters with names such as 'make-you-feel-great cakes', 'skinny puddings' and 'scream for ice cream', plus featuring treats such as apricot and ginger cake, frangipane tart with pears and lemon and lime scented granita, Daisy says there's a recipe suitable for any craving.

Daisy is adamant that we shouldn’t deprive ourselves of the foods we crave. She said: 'I never thought it would be possible for me to kick the sugar habit until I moved to New York.

'There, I tasted natural products that give you a sweet hit without harming your body. Recently I also found out that I am intolerant to wheat and dairy.

'A few of the healthy substitutions I’ve made for wheat, dairy and sugar in these recipes will be new to you, but you will easily be able to find them in health food shops and online.

'My body feels so much healthier and it works better. I have more energy, I sleep better, I get sick less often.

'I am feeding myself, not starving or depriving myself of the sweet things I love. I wanted to share these recipes so you can do the same, and love yourself from the inside out.'

Daisy, 25, is so proud of her cooking skills that she hosts dinner parties for her showbiz pals, such as Nick Grimshaw and Pixie Geldof, as many as four times a week.

Speaking to Grazia Daily about her diet, the size 8 model said: 'I eat healthily for six days, then have Sunday off. It’s taken a long time for me to appreciate my curves. I get insecure about my shape every day.

'I love food so much, sometimes it’s a bit tricky. The weekend after fashion week, I had pizza for lunch, dinner and the leftovers for breakfast. Then I went to the NME Awards and they served Domino’s. I was like, “I stink of pizza!” I don’t starve myself ever, which is clearly why I’m not as tiny as models are - the teeny ones. But I’m OK with that.'

Daisy was first spotted in Camden at the age of 14. Fast forward 10 years and she has starred in major fashion campaigns for Marc by Marc Jacobs, Louis Vuitton and Agent Provocateur and walked for Chanel, Vivienne Westwood and Burberry.

Showbiz pals: Daisy Lowe joined Nick Grimshaw in taking on a tough 12 hour cycle in a transparent box outside the iconic BBC Broadcasting House, all in a bid to rack up 1000 miles towards the 25,000 total for the Radio Around the World Challenge for Sport Relief earlier this week
