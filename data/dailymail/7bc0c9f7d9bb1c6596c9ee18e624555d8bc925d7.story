Lewis Hamilton swapped the pit lane for the runway as he took time out to support his friend Olivier Rousteing at Paris Fashion Week. 

The reigning world champion was enjoying some time off before the new Formula One season kicks off in Australia on March 15.

Mercedes driver Hamilton attended the Balmain show in Paris on Thursday evening.

He then posted a picture online of him with some of the models and said: 'Big congrats to my brother @olivier_rousteing for his show today @balmainparis very proud!'

After the show, Hamilton attended an after-show dinner as part of Paris Fashion Week, where he was accompanied by some big names from the world of music and film.

The 30-year-old was pictured alongside singer and actor Jared Leto, as well as Kanye West and wife Kim Kardashian, who was sporting a new blonde hairstyle.

On the track, Mercedes were considerably faster than their opponents in 2015 and early signs suggest the same will be true this season. Hamilton, though, is eager for competition.

Speaking to Laureus.com, he said: 'I like to race, I really like to race. The 2015 cars are going to be evolutions of last year's cars, so it'll be the same people that we were racing with last year. Red Bull, Williams, and then you're hoping that it's a bit of a better year for those like McLaren and Ferrari, so that we have more people to race. The more the merrier.

'There was one year the first seven races were won by a different driver, a different team, that's what people want to see. But, most importantly, if the cars are close you can have real races where you're overtaking and battling and that's what I love doing. That's what racing's about.'
