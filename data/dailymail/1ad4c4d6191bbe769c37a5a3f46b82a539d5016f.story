Since militant group ISIS claimed to have established an Islamic caliphate, the city of Raqqa has become known as its fanatical capital.

But reports from groups inside the city say there is growing resentment between the poor, who have been largely left to fend for themselves, and Islamic fighters, who live a life of five-star luxury.

While fighters have each been given a pay-rise and a roast lamb to feast on for the festival of Eid al-Adha, the poor have been left to suffer as food an fuel prices spike.

Good life: While Jihadi fighters have been pictured swimming in hotel pools and eating in upmarket restaurants around Raqqa, the city's residents have suffered under the new rule

Happy holiday: Fighters have each been given a pay bonus and lamb to feast on during Eid al-Adha, while in Raqqa may are now dependent on a few weathly benefactors who bankroll charities

Temptation: Extremists have posted images of their seemingly luxurious lifestyle on social media in the hope of tempting other Westerners to join them

Militants have been pictured dining out in five-star restaurants and soaking in hotel pools, while many citizens of Raqqa are now wholly dependent on the few wealthy citizens who still bankroll charities.

Civilians hospitals have also been closed down as doctors abandon their posts, or run out of medical supplies, leaving people to travel to Turkey for medical help, with many dying along the way. 

Speaking to CBS, a source who used the fake name of Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi, said: 'As soon as they arrived, they became the elite of the community.

'They were given comfortable homes and cars -- and they get a generous salary every month.

'Recently, a bombing left many people, including fighters, badly hurt. 'We ran to help and saw ISIS trucks arrive and remove their men for treatment, leaving the civilians just lying there.' 

Suffering: Meanwhile the civilians of Raqqa have been left to suffer the ravages of spiraling food prices and hospitals closing down because of a lack of doctors

Destitute: While fighters have become wealthier under Islamic State rule, the city's poorest have become even poorer as they are largely left to fend for themselves

There are also reports of boys as young as 14 and 15 being snatched from their families and sent to training camps to become ISIS warriors. 

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims sources have spoken of growing unrest in the city between residents and their new leaders.

Many have objected to the harsh punishments handed out by the Hesbah patrols, who have been brought into to enforce strict Sharia laws.

Residents say that while they have turned a blind eye to manipulative traders hiking food and fuel prices, they mercilessly punish minor infringement such as smoking cigarettes.  

There has also been growing resentment against the al-Khansaa Brigade, a female patrol thought to contain several British jihadis, who patrol in disguise unlike their male counterparts.
