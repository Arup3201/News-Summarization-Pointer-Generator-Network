Everton have banned a supporter for allegedly posting homophobic and racist comments about a Malaysian fan on Twitter.

The target of the abuse was Ric Wee, who hit the headlines in February after his plans to see the Toffees play live for the first time in 30 years were undone when the Premier League clash with Crystal Palace at Goodison Park was postponed.

Wee's tweets of disappointment drew huge attention on Twitter and Everton subsequently gave him a tour of the club and the opportunity to meet the players.

An Everton spokesman said: 'The club has contacted a supporter informing them of our decision to ban them from all Everton matches indefinitely after they appeared to have posted homophobic and racist comments linked to the club on the social media site Twitter.

'This is a breach of our ticket terms and conditions.

'Everton has a zero tolerance policy on racism and homophobia.'

The club spokesman confirmed Everton sent a letter on Friday to the Twitter user, who has seven days within which to write back asking for a review of the decision, providing supporting evidence.
