Rupert Murdoch made a dig at the English as he announced plans to split News Corp into two companies

Rupert Murdoch criticised the English and vowed to take his money elsewhere as he announced the splitting up of his company.

The billionaire media mogul said he was now 'a lot more reluctant' to invest in the UK 'because of the English'.

Mr Murdoch was discussing the separation of News Corp into a film and TV entertainment company and one for publishing titles such as the Sun and the Times.

The eighty-one year-old announced the 
plan after a year of intense pressure from the phone hacking scandal at 
the News of the World.

But he denied the decision was a direct result of that and said there had been discussions about it for 'three years'.

'There are billions and billions of 
dollars, and if Britain didn't want 'em, there are plenty of good places
to put them here [in the US]. I'm much more bullish about America than I
am about England,' he told Fox Business.

'I would be a lot more reluctant to invest in new things in Britain today, rather than here.'

Asked if this was because of the phone
hacking revelations and the subsequent Leveson Inquiry, he said: 'No, 
not at all, just the English.'

But analysts were quick to point out that the News Corp was now more likely to be given approval to take control of BSkyB if it mounts a renewed bid for the broadcaster.

Some saw the split as an attempt to distance the lucrative entertainment arm of the business from the newspaper division, which is under scrutiny over alleged phone hacking and payments to police.

Mr Murdoch said it was 'highly 
unlikely' his son Lachlan would be in charge of the publishing business,
responsible for titles including the Sun, the Times, the Wall Street 
Journal, the Herald Sun and Harper Collins.

He said that business prospects in the
U.S. were 'more rosy' than the UK but warned against Barack Obama's 
healthcare plan creating a 'culture of entitlement'.

'We've seen where it's taken Greece. 
We've seen where it's taken France and Spain today. So, on a political 
level, I worry about it,' he added.

Mr Murdoch said he will serve as 
chairman of both new companies and CEO of the entertainment company. The
Murdoch family, which controls nearly 40 percent of the voting shares 
in News Corp., is expected to maintain control of both companies.

News Corp.'s board unanimously 
approved the split in principle. It will take a more formal look at the 
plan's details in coming months. The separation is also subject to 
regulatory approval and is expected to take about a year.

The split of News Corp. is a symbolic 
turning point for Mr Murdoch. Through the years, he maintained a 
fondness for newspapers even as he bought  entertainment companies and 
built a media conglomerate with a market value of $53 billion.

He is known to have regularly called his newspaper editors and asked them: 'What's doing?'

There were some fears among commentators that the Sun and Times could suffer without the financial support of a parent company. Politicians and public officials were now less likely to be held to account without such  established titles being able to investigate them, it is claimed.

But investors have already applauded the 
change. Since news of the split broke early Tuesday, News Corp. shares 
are up 9 percent. They slipped 32 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $21.99 on 
Thursday.

News Corp. said existing shareholders 
will get one share of stock in the publishing company for every News 
Corp. share they own. The exact ratio could change. Each company would 
maintain two classes of stock, voting shares and non-voting shares.

Mr Murdoch is hoping the television 
and movie company will be more highly valued by shareholders who had 
been unwilling to accept the dour growth prospects of the newspaper and 
book business.

But he now faces the challenge of making the publishing division attractive to investors.

Taken as a whole, News Corp.'s 
entertainment businesses are much more promising. In the nine months 
through March, the combined cable channel, TV station, satellite TV and 
movie businesses saw revenue rise 9 percent to $18.66 billion. Operating
profit rose 23 percent to $4.17 billion.

By contrast, the publishing arm's 
revenues and profits have been shrinking over the same period. Revenues 
declined 4 percent to $6.22 billion while operating profits slipped 22 
percent to $458 million.

Investors have long pestered News 
Corp. to get rid of the newspaper business. Mr Murdoch acknowledged 
yesterday that the idea has been discussed internally for more than 
three years.

Still, he said he rejects 'naysayers' who doubt the long-term future of the printed word.

'The answer is one word: it's 
digital,' Murdoch said to analysts on a conference call. 'People are 
buying pure papers printed on crushed wood, but they are equally getting
their news in many other forms.'

Troubled: Murdoch's News Corp has been under pressure to spin off its newspaper business following the phone-hacking scandal

Even so, Murdoch plans to put money 
behind those words. To address the concerns of future shareholders, he 
promised that the publishing division will be split off with 'a robust 
net cash position' to be used for potential acquisitions.

News Corp. had $10.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of March.

Analysts said the split will allow 
Murdoch to pursue the newspaper business with the same fervor he had 
when he began building his empire 60 years ago. It also contains the 
possible damage from mistakes, such as the one he made when he overpaid 
for Dow Jones & Co. in 2007.

'Once the companies are separated, 
he'll be able to make acquisitions without upsetting the valuation of 
the entertainment business,' said Alan Gould, an analyst with Evercore 
Partners. 'I don't worry about the acquisitions he's doing 2 to 3 years 
down the road in publishing.'
