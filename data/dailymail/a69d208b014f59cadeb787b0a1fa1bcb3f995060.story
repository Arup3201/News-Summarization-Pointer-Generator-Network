Justin Bieber is ignoring his mom's desperate attempts to talk some sense into him over his drug issues, MailOnline can reveal.

Patti Mallette, 37, who had the singer when she was just 18, is said to be 'extremely upset' by his DUI arrest on Thursday morning.

She stayed at home and did not fly to her son's side in Miami, but a source admitted she had not been able to get through to him over the past few weeks, adding: 'Justin is not listening to his mother and he’s been trying to avoid dealing with her and other people in his camp.'

With his dad Jeremy Bieber actually on the scene as his son was arrested in Miami (his father was enjoying an all-expenses paid trip by the singer), the source insisted: 'Unlike Jeremy, Patti is 
genuinely very concerned about her son. She’s been very sad and worried 
over the past few weeks.'

After being released from the Turner 
Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami on Thursday afternoon, 
Justin, 19, made a cocky exit perched on top of a black SUV, with his 
eyes shielded by sunglasses.

Appearing in court with his attorney, Roy Black, the singer's bond was set at $2,500.

He is due to fly back to Los Angeles on a private jet, where friends and loved ones will attempt to get him to go to rehab.

'People are pushing him to get help but he doesn’t want help, he says he doesn’t need it and it’s very upsetting for Patti,' said the source.

‘We
 are at a point where he’s around people who are terrible influences, 
but ultimately, he’s about to be 20 on March 1 and you have to make 
your own decisions. He can’t be forced to go to rehab.’

When asked what drugs Justin has been taking, the source said: ‘It’s
 a combination of smoking a ton of pot - constantly smoking - and 
prescription drugs.'

And it's not just Justin's mom who is upset, his long-term manager Scooter Braun is 'concerned' and other members of his team are urging him to get help.

Despite this, TMZ reported today that Justin told cops it was Patti who gave him prescription medication shortly before his DUI arrest.

Police sources told TMZ that when quizzed over what substances he had taken before his arrest, Justin - who was said to have a blood alcohol level of .04 - admitted to being under the influence of anti-anxiety drugs, alcohol and marijuana - but was not sure what kind of prescription drugs he had taken as his mom had given them to him.

As the site reported, when police raided Justin's Calabasas, California house last week following the infamous egg attack, they found Xanax pills in the property.

Meanwhile, Jeremy
 Bieber, 38, had been enjoying a vacation in Miami on his son's dime - 
and was not only present when Justin was arrested but joined the 
singer's camp in helping to block off a residential street so his son 
could drag race.

Tweeting 
about his trip, Jeremy was even in SET nightclub just hours before the 
arrest with his son and was seen strolling along the beach with Justin 
and rapper friend Khalil - who was also arrested.

A
 source told MailOnline: 'Jeremy was in an SUV next to Justin when the 
cops turned up. It's fair to say Jeremy is not a great influence - he 
certainly enjoys and takes advantage of his son's money and lifestyle.'

After
 posting a picture of himself with Justin and Khalil on his Instagram 
site, Jeremy was blasted by Bieber fans, one saying: 'Why aren't you 
f***ing helping your son? He could've been dead by now and you know 
that, right?!'

Another 
added: 'You're (sic) sons in jail. You haven't really been there for 
him. The least you could do is help him and us. I'm not trying to be 
mean.' While one said: 'love your son and help him because is your son 
you are the father not the other son please.'

Heavily
 tattooed Jeremy, who split with Justin's mom Patti when their
 son was 10 months old, is married to Erin and the couple live in Canada
 with their two kids, Jazmyn and Jaxon. 

Speaking to 17 magazine in 2010, 
Justin said although he had been brought up by his single mom, he had a 
'great relationship' with Jeremy, adding: 'When I was younger, he taught
 me how to play some songs on the guitar, like 'Knockin' on Heaven's 
Door' by Bob Dylan.

'He's 
the one who got me into classic rock and then turned me on to stuff like
 Guns N' Roses and Metallica,' Justin told the magazine. 'He taught me 
how to drive too. He's cool.'

Justin even followed in his dad's wake when he got his first tattoo aged 16, of a seagull to match one Jeremy has.
