A former prosecutor and all-Big Ten footballer player has left an Illinois community in shock after being charged with murdering his first wife on Valentine's Day in 2006.

Curtis Lovelace, 45, also previously a school board president, sports broadcaster and educator at a local university, is accused of suffocating mother-of-four Cory Lovelace, 38, at their home in Quincy.

He was arrested by police after investigators reopened the eight-year-old case of Mrs Lovelace's mysterious death in her bed. A pathologist and coroner's jury had formerly deemed it 'inconclusive'.

Lovelace, who was indicted on August 28, is now facing a first-degree murder charge, to which he has pleaded not guilty. He remains at Hancock County Jail on $5million bond

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the allegations against him are the continuing source of gossip in the 40,000-strong former port city of Quincy, situated along the Mississippi River. 

'He just seemed like an average fellow, a very active gentleman,' Mike Cadwell, a barber for 40 years, told the Associated press while giving an older client a trim.

'I'm not sure what kind of a person does that kind of a crime, but he didn't seem to fit that mold.'

Lovelace is also a captain in the Illinois National Guard Judge Advocate Corps, a position that has reportedly not been affected by his indictment on murder charges.

Public Affairs Director Captain Dutch Grove told the Quincy Journal the case, 'is a civil, criminal matter and any administrative action to discharge would wait until this is adjudicated.'

Unanswered: Mrs Lovelace's case left many unanswered questions, but no one suspected Lovelace,  the ex-prosecutor, former all-Big Ten football player, ex-school board president and sports broadcaster

He added: 'We support the civil process as anyone is innocent until presumed guilty.'

In the 1980s, Lovelace was a star jock at Quincy High School in track, wrestling and football, earning six varsity letters and eventual enshrinement in the school's sports hall of fame.

He went on to play football as a center at the University Illinois, where he was the team captain and a two-time all-Big Ten pick. The business major also was an academic all-American - a coup for Lovelace, who has said he got mostly Bs in high school.

Indicted: Lovelace was arrested and indicted for suffocating his first wife on August 28 this year

'I did not come to the University of Illinois as a star athlete or a star student,' Lovelace told the Bloomington Pantagraph in 1990. 'I think I've reached this point with hard work.'

In 1991, Lovelace married former high school classmate Cory Didriksen, gained his law degree at Illinois, started a family and became an assistant prosecutor in Quincy.

However, on February 14, 2006, he said he returned home from taking three of his four children to school to find his wife lying dead in their bed.

According to his account, detailed in the transcripts of a coroner's inquest, Mrs Lovelace had been sick for days prior to her death.

However, an investigator said Lovelace failed to summon emergency responders and did not attempt to resuscitate his partner.

An autopsy and the coroner's jury later failed to determine the cause of death and Mrs Lovelace's body was cremated, the Quincy Journal reported.

'At the time it happened, we just considered it a tragedy,' Mr Cadwell, 64, recalled. 'I knew there was speculation, questions. But he never seemed to be at the center of it.' 

It was in December last year that a newly promoted police detective decided to reopen the case and two pathologists weighed in, determining that Mrs Lovelace had, in fact, been suffocated.

Following Lovelace's arrest, Ed Parkinson of the State Appellate Prosecutor’s Service was appointed in the case as a special prosecutor, according to the  Journal.

Adams County State's Attorney Jon Barnard said that a special prosecutor was requested because Lovelace is a former employee of the Adams County office.

The case also grabbed the attention of renowned physician and forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, who looked into Cory's autopsy report, KHQA said. 

Baden, the primary analyst for HBO's 'Autopsy', has worked on a number of high-profile cases, including reviewing the death of John F. Kennedy.

After Mrs Lovelace's death in 2006, Lovelace married twice more. 

Many around Quincy privately confided that the scandal has been the talk of the town, even if they're reticent about publicly discussing it, citing the community's insular vibe.

Each development has received prominent front-page play in the Quincy Herald-Whig newspaper.

Lovelace's attorneys, Quincy school officials and prominent high school and Illini sports boosters are tight-lipped.

Mrs Lovelace's mother, Martha 'Marty' Didriksen, told an Associated Press reporter on her doorstep that her thoughts had fragmented since her former son-in-law's arrest. She declined to say more.   

Quincy antique store owner Allison O'Donnell, 73, said she was not eager to jump to conclusions about the case. 'Everyone runs their mouth before anyone gets a fair chance [at a trial],' she said.

 'But I'm still from the old school — I don't believe it until I see it [play out in court].'
