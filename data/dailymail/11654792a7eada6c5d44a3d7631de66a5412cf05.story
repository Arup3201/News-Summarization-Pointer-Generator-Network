Gruesome CCTV footage has surfaced of a New Zealand man with what appears to be a large rod lodged in his head making a plea for help inside a service station.

The 23-year-old man is believed to have been attacked while sitting in his car late on Friday night in Katikati, south-east of Auckland.

The scene inside Katikati Caltex store was so shocking that the owner, Lester Gray, suspected it was a prank, reports 3 News.

Store owner Lester Gray said he was in a state of disbelief. 'I was like, 'Man is this a TV show? Is this guy for real?' he said.

'It looked like a Halloween stunt where people where those Halloween costumes over their head. But it was pretty real when he turned around and blood was coming down the side of his head.' 

Police say the 23-year-old was attacked while sitting in his parked car in a suburban street. He was punched in the head then struck with the rod.

Incredibly, not only was he was able to drive about four blocks to the petrol station, he arrived in a composed state.

Dylan Shea, who witnessed the gory scene, said he was in a state of disbelief.

'He just walked in with the rod in his head and I was just like, 'Is that a drum stick in your head? And he was like, 'Nah, it's a rod.'

The rod has been removed and the victim is in a serious but stable condition in Wakato Hospital hospital.

Police have spoken to witnesses and say they are making progress with their investigations.
