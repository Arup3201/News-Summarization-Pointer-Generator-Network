A player on the University of Massachusetts-Amherst basketball team has become the first openly gay college player.

Derrick Gordon, a sophomore guard on the UMass team, made the announcement on ESPN this morning and said that he was happy to be open about his sexuality.

'I've always loved sports but always felt I had to hide and be someone that I’m not. For my whole life I’ve been living my life as a lie,' he told ESPN.

Making history: Derrick Gordon is the first openly gay man in the NCAA's Division I who came out before his college career was over

Starter: Gordon transferred from Western Kentucky University to the University of Massachusetts after his freshman year and played as a starter for the Amherst 'Minutemen' throughout the 2013-2014 season

Happy: His teammates said that he looked as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders when he told them

'I am telling my story so that 
athletes never feel like they have to hide. You can be true to yourself 
and play the sport that you love.'

'I haven't felt like this. Ever.

'It's a lot of weight lifted off my shoulders. I can finally breathe now and live life happily.'

After
 the ESPN interview was published, Gordon posted a photo of himself 
smiling and wearing a Nike shirt with a rainbow-colored hashtag on his 
chest that said '#BETRUE'.

'This
 is the happiest I have ever been in my 22 Years of living...No more 
HIDING!!!...Just want to live life happy and play the sport that I 
love...Really would love to thank my family, friends, coaches, and 
teammates for supporting me,' he wrote in the lengthy caption.

Happy: Gordon posted a photo of himself smiling on Instagram shortly after the news broke, saying that he was thankful for the support of his family, friends and mentors

Accepting: His announcement was reportedly met with nothing but positive comments by his teammates when he told them last week (pictured together in July)

Public: Gordon, 22, said that he accepted his sexuality during his freshman year of college and mentioned that he had a boyfriend last summer but that does not appear to be ongoing

'Ready
 to get back in the gym with my teammates and get on the GRIND and get 
ready for next season!!!! #BETRUE #BEYOURSELF #HONEYBADGER'

University of Missouri football player
 Michael Sam came out in February and NBA player Jason Collins made his 
homosexuality public last May.

Gordon
 still makes history, however, because he will be the first one to come 
out in the NCAA's division I and he chose to do so while he still has 
two college seasons ahead of him.

Though Sam came out to his teammates and 
coaches before his college career ended, he did not make the public 
announcement until after their season had finished but before the NFL 
draft process started.

He said that he closely watched how 
Collins and Sam handled their respective announcements, but also gained 
support from others behind the scenes- even before he came out to his 
family.

He came out to
 his parents and coach, Derek Kellogg, in the end of March and came out 
to his teammates a few days later on April 2 during an impromptu 
meeting.

'It ended up being kind of a short meeting...The guys were like, "We're behind you 100 percent. We cool?"' Coach Kellogg said.

Support: Michael Sam, a top college football player who came out in February, Tweeted his support for Gordon shortly after the revealing interview was published

His announcement wasn't only met with a positive reception in the locker room but also by a bastion of new supporters.

GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said that it showed how 'the tidal wave of support for gay and lesbian athletes continues to surge forward'.

'Derrick's bold decision to come out as gay isn't just significant, it's inspirational. Today, countless young basketball players, athletes, and men of color have another outstanding role model who reflects the fact that you can be who you want to be no matter who you love,' Ms Ellis said in a statement.

Michael Sam chimed in over Twitter, telling his more than 95,000 followers and Gordon that he has 'so many in your corner and we're all proud and rooting for you'.
