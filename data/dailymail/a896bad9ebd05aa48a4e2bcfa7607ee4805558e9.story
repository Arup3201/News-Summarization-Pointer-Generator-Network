Eman Moss called 911 at 3:43am Saturday claiming his daughter 'drank some kind of chemical,' he also said he was suicidal, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Though he initially said the girl's body was inside the apartment beside him, officers responding to the scene found the deranged man outside his apartment, he then pointed to a trash can across the parking lot.

'Once the officers took the lid off the trash can [and] saw the body, they put the lid back on,' an official told WSB.

The grisly discovery remains somewhat of a mystery, as there is no evidence of a fire in the apartment or the immediate area, WSB reported.
