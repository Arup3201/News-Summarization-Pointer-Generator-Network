His fans read like a roll call of Hollywood royalty so Giorgio Armani was bound to pull something magical out of the bag at his SS14 couture show.

The Armani Privé couture collection, as part of the Paris installment of his One Night Only celebrations, showcased his exquisite craftsmanship in a range of dazzling blue and purple evening dresses that certainly wouldn't look out of place on the red carpet.

'This is a woman who moves around the world and picks ideas from the beautiful things she sees, what moves her emotionally: the colour of a skirt, jewellery that can be ethnic or not,' said Armani of the collection called Nomade.

Man of the night: Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani celebrations at the end of the Giorgio Armani Prive Haute Couture Spring-Summer 2014 collection show, which saw an array of dazzling gowns sashay down the catwalk

All that glitters: Armani's collection was described as 'not typically Indian or African or European' and consisted of voluminous skirts and gowns with crystal embellishment; perfect for the red carpet

The famed designer, who counts Cate Blanchett as his muse, described the collection as a 'mélange of things - not typically Indian or African or European. She moves with an Armani spirit in her head.'

As well as A-list worthy gowns, Armani introduced some androgyny in the form of perfectly tailored jackets over voluminous trousers.

Other statement pieces included a mesh shawl worn over a sheer blouse and billowing skirts in mesmerizing shades of midnight blue and deep purple.

The front row was occupied by Kristin Scott Thomas and songstress Paloma Faith, who both exuded glamour as they posed for photographs with the designer backstage.

The Twittersphere seemed to approve of Armani's offering. Vogue wrote: 'If you're taking on the world's limelight, you can't go wrong in an Armani.'

Another user added: 'This is what professional glamour looks like, courtesy of @Armani Privé.'
