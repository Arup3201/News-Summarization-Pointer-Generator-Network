Accomplice: Mohammed Khalib, 53, persuaded his stepdaughter's best friend Zanbi Mirza (above) to take part in the 'crash for cash' prang

A conman who staged a ‘crash for cash’ prang involving his stepdaughter’s best friend has been jailed for 10 months.

Mohammed Khalid, 53, deliberately swerved his Vauxhall Corsa in front of a teenage motorist at a roundabout exit on the A4 near Maidenhead, Berkshire.

He then slammed on his brakes to cause an accident, before filing an insurance claim.

He persuaded 22-year-old Zanbi Mirza - his stepdaughter's best friend - to take part in the prang so he could blame it on her, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Khalib, from Ilford, Essex, has now been imprisoned after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud.

The court heard Khalib's white Vauxhall Corsa and a silver vehicle - carrying Mirza and an unknown Asian man - had been travelling around the Thicket Road roundabout at around 9pm. 

They deliberately swerved in front of a car driven by teenage driver Thomas Griffiths, before suddenly braking - leading to a three-car pile-up.

Following the crash in March last year, Khalib handed his insurance details - under the name of Mirza - to Mr Griffiths.

He then told his insurance company that his £2,600 vehicle had been 'written off', the court heard.

However, police later found Khalib's car parked on the driveway outside his home with 'little damage'.

Sally Fudge, prosecuting, said: 'This is a “crash for cash” staged vehicle accident.

Scene: Khalid deliberately swerved his Vauxhall Corsa in front of a teenage motorist at the Thicket Roundabout (pictured) on the A4 near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He then slammed on his brakes to cause an accident

‘As Mr Griffiths got to the roundabout, he allowed two vehicles to come around the roundabout and then he pulled out behind them.

'He left a gap between his car and the white Vauxhall Corsa as they approached the exit for the A4, but at the last moment the cars swerved sharply to the right.

‘The two cars were acting in unison and caused the crash to the innocent third party.'

Khalid, who was born in Pakistan, told police that Mirza had planned to stage an accident for money because she was unemployed.

However, officers later discovered the fraudster had transferred ownership
 of the car and his insurance policy to Mirza just days before the 
accident - with a view to blaming her if they were caught. 

Jailed: The conman is now facing 10 months in jail after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud at Southwark Crown Court (pictured). Mirza has been handed a 240-hour community order after admitting the same charge

Sentencing Khalib, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told him: 'This was despicable behaviour - not just getting Ms Mirza involved but diminishing your responsibility by blaming her.'

He added: ‘This case is a good example of how 
this type of offence does cause physical danger - two cars acting in 
concert causing a crash.

‘Thankfully,
 in this case, nobody was hurt, but it takes little imagination to see 
the physical and psychological injury that can be caused by 
orchestrating a car accident like this.'

Mirza, from, Plaistow, east London, also admitted conspiracy to defraud and was handed a 240-hour community service order.
