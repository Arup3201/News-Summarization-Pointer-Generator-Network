Ministers were last night accused of plotting to introduce secret inquests by the back door.

Justice Secretary Ken Clarke promised the idea had been abandoned after critics including the Daily Mail and civil liberties groups campaigned fiercely against it.

But MPs and peers now say a clause has been quietly slipped into the Justice and Security Bill, which is going through Parliament, allowing ministers to revive it.

Backtracking? Justice Secretary Ken Clarke had promised that the idea of secret inquests had been abandoned

Alarmingly, an influential Lords committee says the decision could be taken on the orders of a Cabinet minister without the need for Parliamentary legislation.

Critics say the move would mean inquests into police shootings and soldiers killed by so-called ‘friendly fire’ could take place behind closed doors.

Clare Algar, executive director of the campaign group Reprieve, said: ‘Ministers claim secret courts will only be used for a tiny number of cases but what this development shows is that once this dangerous legislation is on the books there is a real risk it will be used by future governments to cover up embarrassing facts which they would rather the public did not hear.

‘Secret courts are not just a threat to centuries of British legal freedoms, but also to the central principle of our democracy: That politicians must be accountable to the people that they serve.’

Last night it emerged that ministers want to ban the public from knowing that a secret evidence session is even taking place in civil cases, such as a torture compensation hearings.

The Press would not be told that an application to hold parts of the hearing behind closed doors had been lodged by the Government, preventing journalists challenging the request or even reporting it.

Campaigners likened the proposal to the ‘super injunctions’ obtained by adulterous celebrities.

The controversy centres on the Government’s plan to introduce secret courts in civil cases involving national security.

It claims they are needed to deal with compensation claims brought by terror suspects who allege they have been tortured with the complicity of our security services.

Similar cases have already led to payments of millions of pounds to former Guantanamo Bay detainees and other alleged fanatics.

Ministers say that if a case involves sensitive intelligence that could identify an agent’s identity, or was provided by an ally who wants it to remain secret, the Government should be able to present evidence in secret.

However, in a hugely contentious move, ministers originally also proposed going even further by allowing inquests to be held behind closed doors.

This provoked a ferocious backlash, led by the Mail, civil liberty campaigners and the Royal British Legion, which was appalled by the idea of military equipment shortages or friendly-fire deaths being hushed up.

In May, however, Mr Clarke conceded defeat over inquests. Writing in the Mail, he said: ‘It’s hardly a secret that I hail from the liberal wing of the Conservative Party.

‘If protecting our democratic society means riding roughshod over historic freedoms – freedom of speech, a free Press, an independent judiciary and open justice – then truly we have forgotten what we are fighting for.’

But analysis of the remaining elements of the Justice and Security Bill reveal a clause that critics say could allow the idea to be revived.

Clause 11(2) says the ‘Secretary of State may by order... add or remove a court or tribunal’ to the list of civil hearings that can be held in secret.

Having scrutinised the Bill, the Lords Constitution Committee said this could be used to add inquests.

The Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee agreed, warning that the clause meant no legislation would be needed for a future Secretary of State to introduce them. It said: ‘The powers are undoubtedly wide. They would, for instance, enable the Secretary of State to specify any court or tribunal, although not in so far as it exercises a criminal jurisdiction; and they might, in our view, be exercised so as to specify a coroner’s court.’

Ministers deny this is the case. They also insist there are no plans to break their pledge on inquests.

But campaigners want no room for doubt that could be exploited by a future government. Baroness Williams of Crosby said: ‘I can think of nothing that would do more to undermine public confidence in the judicial system than an attempt to try to include coroners’ courts.

‘There has been a promise from the Lord Chancellor that this will not happen. But I cannot understand why the Bill still clearly indicates that there could be a power to include such a court.

‘The Bill says that in exact terms. The idea... would so outrage large sections of the public, especially on publicly very sensitive cases, that I can think of little that would do more to undermine confidence.’

Last night, Ministry of Justice officials insisted the legislation would not cover inquests and said any change to the law would require primary legislation, adding: ‘The Justice and Security Bill does not and could not in the future allow closed procedures to be used in inquests.

‘Nothing currently heard in open will go into closed session, but these reforms will enable the media to report judgments in cases which currently receive no media scrutiny.’
