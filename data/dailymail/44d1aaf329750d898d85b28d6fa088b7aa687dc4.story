Down in the mouth: Sad Toto has lived alone since his partner Topsy died, but is too old to live with anyone else

A zoo which was inundated with visitors worried about their lonely-looking chimp has had to put a sign up to reassure guests that he is just missing his mate.

Families with young children visiting Drayton Manor Theme Park and Zoo, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, have been worried that chimpanzee Toto might be severely unwell.

But keepers have insisted the glum-looking ape is suffering from a broken heart after his life-partner Topsy died of natural causes seven years ago.

The pair were said to have been inseparable after spending 45 years together at the zoo since they arrived within a year of each other in 1968 and 1969.

After Topsy died, staff at the zoo looked into pairing up her dejected partner with another chimp, but were advised by primate specialists that he would be better off staying in the home he had known for so long.

A zoo spokesman said: 'We decided that rather than attempt to 
introduce him to a new group, the best course of action for Toto was to 
remain at Drayton Manor Zoo, the only home he has ever known, in the 
care of keepers who know and love him.'

He said Topsy lived alone because it would not be safe to introduce a single, elderly animal into a new group.

A sign has now been erected outside Toto’s enclosure informing zoo visitors of the reasons behind the grieving 47-year-old’s downcast demeanour.

It explains why the zoo took the decision to keep Toto in an enclosure by himself, saying: 'We took the decision to let him live
out his remaining days here in the place he knew well with the staff 
who had looked after him from a youngster.

Toto lived with his mate Topsy (pictured) from 1969 until she died in 2005. Since then he has lived alone

'We
did not feel trying to introduce a new partner was the the answer, as 
when he eventually dies we would be left in the same situation.

'We
fully understand that not everyone agrees with our decision, but we 
stand by it and have the support of our licensing authority and zoo 
inspectors.

Today families visiting the zoo said they were sad to learn why the chimp looks so down in the mouth.

Toto and Topsy would preen each other and share their toys and beds in their joint enclosure

Hannah Wildman, 30, who was with her daughter Aimee, five, said: 'While it’s good to hear that he is not seriously ill, the story behind his depression is still absolutely heartbreaking.

'His eyes look tinged with sadness - he looks really down in the dumps.'

Louise Cartwright, 30, who had taken her niece Sabrina, seven, to the theme park, added: 'You’ve got to feel sorry for old Toto. He looks so glum.'

The zoo spokesman said keepers were told to make a special effort to keep Toto from dwelling on his sadness, coming up with games and activities to keep him busy..

Head keeper Alan Carter, who has looked after Toto for 30 years, said: 'Toto and Topsy used to preen each other a lot, share toys and beds - they were in the same enclosure together.
