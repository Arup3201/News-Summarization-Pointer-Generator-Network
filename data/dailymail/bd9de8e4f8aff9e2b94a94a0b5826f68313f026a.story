The Galaxy were honoured alongside ice hockey's La Kings in a joint ceremony on Monday in the East Room of the White House.

Obama has praised Los Angeles for providing two championship winning teams

The President said he may be resentful as a Chicago sports fan, but he has to give credit to Los Angeles for producing two championship teams. 

Obama claims Los Angeles has an 'embarrassment of riches' in sports and that he's especially impressed that a city with no snow, ice or winter can turn into a hockey town.

He also gave a special shout-out to Galaxy star Robbie Rogers as the MLS league's first openly gay player.

'I want to recognise what Robbie Rogers of the Galaxy has done for a lot of people by blazing a trail as one of professional sports' first openly gay players,' he said.

'My guess is that as an athlete Robbie wants to win first and foremost, that's what competition is all about, but Robbie, you've also inspired a whole lot of folks here and around the world, and we are very proud of you.'

He wished both teams the best of luck 'when you are not playing Chicago.'

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will join the Galaxy this summer as they look for another MLS title.
