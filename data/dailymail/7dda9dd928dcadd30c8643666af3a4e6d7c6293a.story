A website used by married people to have adulterous affairs is being accessed thousands of times a month from parliamentary computers used by MPs, peers and their staff, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Out Of Town Affairs, which brings together married men and women seeking sex, has been clicked on an astonishing 52,375 times in just seven months via computers exclusively used by members of the Houses of Parliament and their employees.

In one month, Out Of Town Affairs received 289 Westminster hits a day. 

'Dirty' dating: The sign-up page for the Out of Town Affairs website, which brings together married men and women seeking sex

Incredibly, the site had more hits in December from parliamentary computers than the official websites for the Treasury, Ministry of Justice and Department for Education.

The website, which contains explicit pictures of subscribers, boasts: ‘We connect you with thousands of other married men and women looking for a marital affair or more heat in the bedroom. The variety of new members is fantastic.’

And the site adds: ‘Marital affairs in the UK [are] very popular – with more and more unsatisfied married men and women looking to do the dirty [on] their partners whilst out of town.’

Users are invited to contact ‘thousands of horny cheaters ready to get some action’ by signing up for a fee of £25 a month, which allows them to ‘write your own sex-date diary’ and ‘read and send filthy messages’.

The Mail on Sunday made the discovery after submitting a Freedom of Information request, asking for the top 500 websites accessed on Parliament computers over the past year.

In December, the website received 8,457 page views from computers based in the heart of the country’s democracy. In November, it received 7,533 hits, in October, 8,971 hits, in August, 5,174, in July, 7,493, in June, 6,822 and in February, 7,925.

The owner of Out Of Town Affairs told The Mail on Sunday he was surprised that MPs or Lords were visiting the site.

‘That’s a lot of hits,’ he said. ‘It’s got to be more than one person going on the site from Parliament. I hope we don’t get hate mail from parliamentary wives now.

‘It’s an adult dating site, but you market it as an affairs website because that’s where all the Google searches come from.’

When they are not looking for affairs, Westminster internet users are spending time gambling, playing games, chatting on social network sites, or simply killing time.

There are thousands of hits on gambling websites, while  i-am-bored.com, featuring ‘viral videos, games, memes, lists and social networking for when you’re bored’, had 21,371 hits in the last three months of 2012 alone.

Facebook clocked up an astonishing 28 million hits over a year.

Computer gaming is a popular Westminster pastime too, with chess and solitaire websites accessed thousands of times  a month.

Online games such as FarmVille, Fairyland and Mafia Wars were also popular, while grooveshark.com, offering chart hits, received 709,740 hits in a year.

Robert Oxley, campaign manager for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers expect parliamentarians and their staff to spend their time making laws and scrutinising the Government, not looking for an affair.’

A Parliament spokesman said ‘more than 5,000 people’ had access to parliamentary network computers but that the Out Of Town Affairs website broke IT rules and had now been blocked.

However, no investigation would be launched.

She added: ‘We allow people to use the computers for personal use in non-working hours.’
