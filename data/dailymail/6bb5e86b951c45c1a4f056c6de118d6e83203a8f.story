A 17-year-old  girl with cancer has gone to court to stop child services forcing her to have chemotherapy.

Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but does not want to receive the recommended treatment. 

Her mother Jackie Fortin told NBC Connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want 'poison' in her body.

Cassandra was so distressed that she was being made to have treatment that she ran away from home and was then taken in custody by the Department of Children and Families 

'She has always—even years ago—said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body,' Ms Fortin explained.

She said that after the diagnosis, doctors at Connecticut Children's Medical Center pushed Cassandra to undergo chemotherapy against her will.

She was then returned to Connecticut Children's Medical Center to start chemo.

'CCMC reported to the Department of Children and Families that I was not giving medical attention to my daughter,' said Ms Fortin.

Cassandra has her mother's support in her decision. Ms Fortin said that after the diagnosis, doctors at Connecticut Children's Medical Center pushed Cassandra to undergo chemotherapy against her will

A court summary says after the teen received the diagnosis, her mother backed her choice - although one month later the Department of Children and Families obtained a temporary custody order 'and directed her mother to provide and cooperate with medical care under the the Department of Children and Families supervision and as recommended by her doctors.'

Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells 

Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands.

These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50.

The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever).

It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it.

The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy.

Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent.

Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 

She ran away after receiving two November chemotherapy treatments - and turned down treatment after she returned, according to the summary.

It states Cassandra was placed in the custody of DCF after a court hearing where her doctors gave testimony and that the court also authorized DCF to make all necessary medical decisions on Cassandra's behalf.'

Cassandra and her mother appealed the ruling and their case will be heard Thursday at the Connecticut Supreme Court in Hartford. 

'It's a question of fundamental constitutional rights-- the right to have a say over what happens to your body-- and the right to say to the government 'you can't control what happens to my body,' Cassandra's mother's attorney, Michael S. Taylor, told Fox CT. 

A public defender represents Cassandra. 

'The Supreme Court of the state has never ruled on this issue, the Supreme Court of the United States has not ruled on this issue. So it's very significant not just for our client, and for the minor child, but for the law in general,' Mr Taylor told the news channel.

ABC News reported that Cassandra has has around three weeks' worth of chemotherapy and is now at Connecticut Children's Medical Center.

'She knows the long-term effects of having chemo, what it does to your organs, what it does to your body,' her mother said in a video for The Hartford Courant. 

'She may not be able to have children after this because it affects everything in your body. 

It not only kills cancer, it kills everything in your body.'

Continuing chemotherapy would give Cassandra'a survival rate between 80 and 85 percent, The Hartford Courant reported.

In a statement to ABC News, Connecticut's DCF said:  'When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. 

'Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realize solutions to family challenges. Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.'
