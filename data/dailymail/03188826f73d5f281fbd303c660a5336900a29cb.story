A hatmaker whose work graced the heads of three generations of royalty has died at 84.

Philip Somerville designed hundreds of creations for the Queen, Diana, Princess of Wales and latterly Kate Middleton before she became the Duchess of Cambridge.

Working during the Eighties and Nineties, he was one of the Queen’s favourite milliners and at one stage was making up to 50 hats a year for the monarch, who famously never goes without one.

‘Often I’ve put something on Her Majesty’s head and said, “Oops, I don’t like that, that’s not right”,’ he once said. ‘I don’t think she’s ever been used to that.’

More recently, he designed at least one hat for Kate Middleton before her marriage to Prince William.

The black and white design she wore in 2008 when the prince was made a member of the Order of the Garter was auctioned for £3,222 in June 2012.

Mr Somerville is also said to have designed 100 or so hats for Diana, Princess of Wales – who first came across his work on a television advert.

His creations were ‘safety-proofed’ against sartorial disasters caused by heavy wind or rain. It was usually a case of using two hatpins, he once said.

In 1987, he designed a striking fur hat for Margaret Thatcher during a crucial state visit to Russia to meet then president Mikhail Gorbachev. The son of a cobbler who grew up in Winchester, he once said of the Queen: ‘People say, “What does she do with all those hats?” Wear them out, I say. They get damaged and they wear out. She’d possibly wear hats at least ten times, and that’s a long time. Most people would only buy a hat and wear it once and then they put it away in a box.’

Diana, Princess of Wales first came across Mr Somerville’s work on a television advert. In this photo she is wearing one of his creations in Dubai during the Royal Tour of the Gulf in March 1989

He also revealed that the monarch’s head was ‘slightly smaller’ than average, about 22in in circumference – the average head being 22.5in.

Royal milliners collaborate closely with the Queen’s dress designers to achieve a closely coordinated look.

They are sent sketches and fabric swatches of every new outfit before attending the first fitting. Fitting sessions, by Mr Somerville’s account, were relatively informal, partly thanks to his cheerful nature and occasionally disarming frankness. ‘Often I’ve put something on Her Majesty’s head and said, “Oops, I don’t like that, that’s not right”,’ he once said. ‘I don’t think she’s ever been used to that.’

After school, he joined the Merchant Navy before dabbling with a career in acting. By this point, his family had moved to New Zealand and he joined them there. In 1953, he began a career in millinery and was sent to Europe in 1961 by the Star Hat Company of Auckland. Speaking about his work for Diana, Princess of Wales Mr Somerville once said: ‘Pink and red don’t usually go together, so I was surprised when the princess came to see me one day in 1989 asking for a hat to go with a pink and red Catherine Walker outfit she would be wearing in Dubai. When she mentioned the colours she giggled and asked what I thought. “I know it’s a little bit strange,” she told me, “but I love it”.’
