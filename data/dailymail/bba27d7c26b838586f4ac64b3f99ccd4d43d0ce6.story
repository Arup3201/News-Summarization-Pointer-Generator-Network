Luis Suarez has left Liverpool for Barcelona in a £75million deal and the rest of the country will bid 'Good Riddance'.

Branded a biting, racist cheat, the shamed striker's admittance of guilt over biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini was the final insult for a proud club that lent him so much support.

Liverpool have taken the decision to sell as they could no longer countenance the tarnishing of their image.

Fined: Suarez was accused of racially abusing Patrice Evra in a game against Manchester United

His four year stay left a trail of havoc; diving, obscene gestures, racially abusing Patrice Evra and biting the arm of Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic.

Defending Suarez had arguably already cost previous manager Kenny Dalglish his job and Brendan Rodgers spoke sympathetically of how Suarez was a reformed character who had learned from his mistakes.

Declared English football's player of the year, Suarez professed his love for Liverpool, shed public tears when they let the Premier League title slip through their grasp and still spoke of his desire to stay.

Barely 50 days later, many of the club's fans are questioning whether his fiendish actions in Brazil have all been part of a calculated, manipulative plan to escape to Spain.

His bite on PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal in 2010 preceded a move from Ajax, his bite on Ivanovic precipitated Arsenal's interest and now Chiellini has seemingly served his purpose.

Suarez's apology, for sinking his teeth into the Italian's shoulder and gaining a four month suspension, has been praised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter and a Barcelona hierarchy desperate to be vindicated in their choice of signing.

Waving goodbye: Suarez did so much to rectify his reputation in England, but it is now back in the gutter

Mesmeric footballer though he is, the boy who rose from the Salto street gutter of Uruguay has returned to the gutter in many people's eyes.

England captain Steven Gerrard hailed Suarez as the best player he has ever played with. For all his wonderful skill and spectacular goals though, his behaviour means he cannot be compared to the pantheon of great foreign talent to have graced the Premier League.

Do not forget his talk of retribution following his dismantling of England's World Cup hopes in Uruguay's 2-1 win; criticising how this country has treated him. 'Before the game, too many people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,' he said. 'This is a very good time for me. I want to see what they think now.'

Not much Luis and even less once you took a liking to Chiellini's tenderised shoulder.

Feted as an idol, this man's actions have been borderline grotesque and now his wishes have been granted with a move to Barcelona.

Adios. You're welcome to him.
