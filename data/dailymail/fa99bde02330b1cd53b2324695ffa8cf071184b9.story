The tragic death of Jay Muscat who was killed by a great white shark on Monday has again stirred up debate on whether sharks should be culled to help prevent this from happening again or if people should be more aware of the facts before swimming in the sea. 

Mr Muscat was killed in an area very common for sharks at this time of year. A great white was spotted circling just off these waters a few weeks previously. 

Western Australia’s Department of Fisheries put capture gear and drum lines around Cheynes Beach on Tuesday. But shark expert and environmentalist Andrew Fox believed that they were treating the symptom not the cause.

The culling of sharks off Australia's coast is one way of dealing with the problem, but environmentalists say that it's people's mindsets that have to change

‘People need to be better informed about sharks. In every situation where there has been a shark attack in recent times it’s been when there’s been increased numbers and sightings of sharks,’ Fox explained.

‘There should be a better network of information where people know the activity of sharks in the area and make an informed decision on whether they should go into the sea or not.’

Mr Muscat was spearfishing when he was attacked at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, around 70km east of Albany. The 17-year-old was mauled by the shark and his friend Matt Pullella only escaped death by putting the spear gun into the shark’s mouth and firing the trigger. 

The dangers are apparent, but Fox explained that because the seal and whale population was increasing there’ll naturally be a redistribution and increase of great white sharks coming inshore to feed.

‘To kill a shark that has attacked somebody is ludicrous. It’s only responding to a natural stimulus that it has evolved with,’ he said.

Shark expert Andrew Fox argues killing sharks is pointless as the shark is 'only responding to a natural stimulus that it has evolved with'

Jeff Hansen managing director of Sea Shepherd Australia said one of his organisation's vessels Bruce The Rib would be going to Cheynes Beach to monitor what was happening 

A key factor in recent attacks has been that victims have been spear fishing when they’ve been attacked. It’s a hobby that has cost some young people their lives. Mr Muscat is the second teen to be killed while spear fishing this month, following the death of 18-year-old Daniel Smith, at Port Douglas in far north Queensland.

‘When the fish is speared it begins to bleed and struggle. The vibration the fish makes in the water combined with the smell attracts the shark. It does make the chances of an attack even more likely,’ Fox said.

‘Again, information should be available so people can decide whether they should go out spear fishing in certain areas. You just need to be made aware.’

Western Australia’s Department of Fisheries reaction to Monday’s shark attack was to deploy capture gear and drum lines around Cheynes Beach on Tuesday in an attempt to catch the shark.

Sea Shepherd vessel Bruce The Rib and its crew were headed from Perth to Albany today to keep eye on what the Western Australian Department of Fisheries were up to at Cheynes Beach 

Rick Fletcher, a Department of Fisheries spokesman said that if any shark of a comparable size – a four to five-metre-long great white – was caught it would be killed.

'At this stage it's highly likely that if we capture the shark that's likely to have been involved in the incident it will be destroyed,' he said. 

Earlier this year the Western Australia government trialled using baited drum lines to cull sharks. The policy was hugely controversial and resulted in 170 sharks being killed. The Environmental Protection Agency sunk the policy in a ruling earlier this year.

However, the government is still able to use drum lines if they are threat to beach-goers, Mr Barnett was quoted saying in September.

On Tuesday environmental group Sea Shepherd said they were also sending one of their members Mike Dicks with his boat Bruce The Rib to Cheynes Beach to herd any sharks away from the drum lines and if the Fisheries do kill something to document it in full.

‘Killing sharks won’t make a difference. There were sharks spotted in the area days before this incident occurred, so once again that information is not being sent throughout the community,’ Jeff Hansen managing director of Sea Shepherd Australia said.

‘At certain times of the year there should be signage at beaches saying that great whites or tiger sharks have been seen in the area – to enter the water at your own risk. Beach patrols should be carried out regularly too.’ 

Mr Hansen said that the Western Australia government once did a survey on the issue and results showed that 80 per cent of the people were against the killing of sharks.

‘Mitigating the risk of entering the marine environment is up to the individual not the government,’ Hansen said. ‘So who is the government doing this on the behalf of? They keep going on about a silent majority but their own survey shows that this silent majority doesn’t exist.’

Australia has witnessed a number of shark attacks this year, some fatal. In September, British expat Paul Wilcox, 50, was killed in a shark attack in Byron Bay, at the eastern-most point of New South Wales. While Sean Pollard, 23, from Bunbury, WA, lost an arm and both hands when he came under attack by a great white in October.
