The life and work of Sir David Frost, who died of a heart attack on board a cruise liner last year, has been commemorated in a memorial service at Westminster Abbey today.

Sir David, who probably 
interviewed more world figures from royalty, politics, the Church, 
show-business and virtually everywhere else, than any other living 
broadcaster, was the most illustrious TV inquisitor of his generation - as today's starry guest list proved.

On
 a sunny day in the capital, the stylish ladies turned out to show their
 support for the public figure, who died aged 74 in August last year.

Among the glamorous guests were Pippa Middleton, Sienna Miller, Cherie Blair, Lara Stone and Jemima Khan, as well as Sarah Ferguson, Princess Beatrice and the Duke of York.

Sir David Frost died from a heart attack while on a luxury liner â€“ far from 
specialised medical assistance.

Sir
 David was on the Queen Elizabeth on its way from Southampton to 
Lisbon, preparing to give a talk later in the cruise about his career, 
when he collapsed on the Saturday night.

Sir David, who leaves three sons, Miles, 29, 
Wilfred, 28, and George, 26, was travelling alone, although his wife 
Lady Carina, 61, second daughter of the Duke of Norfolk, had accompanied
him on previous cruises.

Springtime day: Santa Montefiore and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson arrived on the sunny Thursday

Sir David was widely described as a 'non-judgmental interviewer' with a strong sense of morality.

He
not only won virtually all the major television awards available, but 
his professional activities were so diverse that he was once described 
as 'a one-man conglomerate'.

A highlight of his 40-year career was his interview with the doomed American President 'Tricky Dicky' Richard Nixon in 1977.

He quizzed the President on the Watergate Scandal that had emerged in the early 1970s .

Sir David first came to notice nationally with the Saturday
night TV satirical programme That Was The Week That Was, which he hosted and
co-created in the early 1960s.

It shocked authority, and was a programme not to be missed
by those who were its victims as much as by those who enjoyed seeing the great
and the good so savagely ridiculed.

But it 'made' Sir David who was then seen as a
coruscating rebel, although quite a likeable one, and who was to develop,
ironically, as an Establishment figure in his own right.

David Paradine Frost was born on April 7, 1939, the son of a
Methodist preacher, at Tenterden, Kent. He was educated at Gillingham Grammar
School, Wellingborough Grammar School and Gonville and Caius College,
Cambridge.

At Cambridge he joined Footlights, the renowned revue and
cabaret society. He then started to do some TV for the regional station in
Norwich, particularly a programme called Town and Gown which was about
Cambridge.

Another
 of his programmes, The Frost Report, effectively launched John Cleese, 
Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett on their subsequent glittering careers.

Sir
 David's list of interviewees reads like a roll call of the world's most
 famous and powerful people. They include virtually every US president 
and British prime minister during his working life.

Others included 
Prince Charles, the Duke and Duchess of York, the Princess Royal, Robert
 F Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Pierre Trudeau, Mikhail Gorbachev, Indira 
Gandhi, Benazir Bhutto, King Hussein, Golda Meir, Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak
 Rabin, Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk, and countless more.

He
 was the only person to have interviewed all six British prime ministers
 serving between 1964 and 2007and the seven US presidents in office 
between 1969 and 2008.     

Among
 his awards were two Emmy Awards (for The David Frost Show), the Royal 
Television Society Silver Medal and the Richard Dimbleby Award in the 
United Kingdom and internationally, the Golden Rose of Montreux.

Over the years, Sir 
David wrote 17 books, produced several films and started two television 
networks, London Weekend Television and TV-am.

In 1983, he married Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, second daughter of the Duke of Norfolk. There were three sons.

He was awarded an OBE in 1970 and received his knighthood in 1993.

Sir David became famous after interviewing 
President Nixon in 1977. The politician was forced to admit that he had taken 
part in the infamous Watergate scandal

Sir David Frost has probably interviewed more 
world figures from royalty, politics, the Church, and show-business than anyone else

He is said to have been a 'fearsome' interviewer'. Pictured here with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
