Allowances: Idreez Popoola, 34, should have been deported in 2006 after his temporary UK visa expired but he was allowed to continue living and working in Britain

An illegal immigrant who was twice spared deportation went on to rape a woman just months after using human rights legislation to remain in the UK.

Idreez Popoola, 34, will finally be sent back to his home country of Nigeria when he is released from a seven-year jail term imposed after the attack in the victim’s home.

Last night an MP said the case highlighted Britain’s ‘dysfunctional’ border controls.

A court heard that Popoola came to the UK on a 12-month visa in 2005, but when it expired he was given permission to remain on a temporary basis.

But when Popoola was arrested by Northamptonshire Police in December 2011 over an allegation of assault he was found to be an ‘overstayer’ – an immigrant who had not left the country by an agreed date.

Although no charges followed the alleged assault, Popoola – by now married with a child – was told he would be deported.

However, he successfully appealed the ruling, arguing that the Human Rights Act provided him with the right to a family life.

Northampton Crown Court heard that Popoola, who worked as a nightclub bouncer, was granted temporary leave to remain in the UK again in January last year, after his family circumstances were taken into account.

But 11 months later he went on to brutally rape a woman in her own home.

Bouncer: The court heard Popoola met his victim while working as an agency-employed bouncer outside Bar So in Northampton town centre

Popoola, who sold mobile phone top-up 
cards in Nigeria before moving to the UK, is thought to have lived in 
Oxford before settling in Thornton Heath, South London, where he trained
as a bouncer and gained work with an agency which supplied a 
Northampton nightclub.

Judges granted Popoola the temporary right to stay in the UK because he had family just days before he raped a woman in her home

Gordon
Aspden, prosecuting, said Popoola met his victim at a McDonald’s 
restaurant in the town. After going back to her home he attacked her, 
then forced her to drive him to a train station.

Popoola was sentenced to seven years after being found guilty of rape following a four-day trial.

Judge
Lynn Tayton told him: ‘It was a serious aggravating factor that the 
rape took place in the victim’s own home, as this was an abuse of the 
trust placed in you by the victim and has undermined her feelings of 
safety in her own space.’

Michael Ellis, Tory MP for Northampton North, said: ‘This is an example of the dysfunctional border control in the UK.

‘Although
there has been considerable improvement since this government took 
over, the previous regime was completely not fit for purpose.

‘Here 
is another example of someone who has gone on to commit a serious and 
unforgivable act when they shouldn’t have even been in the country at 
all.’

Alp Mehmet, deputy chairman of the Migration Watch UK pressure
group, said: ‘The sensible course of action, in respect of anyone 
without a right to be here, is to remove them as speedily as possible.’

A
Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have introduced tough new rules to 
protect the public from those who try to stay here through abuse of the 
Human Rights Act.

'Our Immigration Bill will give the full force of 
legislation to our policy that foreign criminals should ordinarily be 
deported despite their claim to a family life.'
