Celtic boss Ronny Deila insists he has no doubts over Virgil van Dijk’s continued commitment to the club despite wrecking the central defender’s dream of a deadline-day move to the Barclay’s Premier League.

Deila left van Dijk out of the starting XI for their 1-1 draw with Dundee at Dens Park after telling the Dutchman he would be going nowhere despite interest from Newcastle, Sunderland and Swansea.

‘He had of course wishes to get to a new stage,’ said Deila, who remains positive about landing Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic despite fears of a last-minute hitch.

‘He is a young player and a young man - and he will get many chances in his career. But now we need we need him here and he knows that and that is how it is going to be.

Disappointment: Virgil van Dijk was incredibly disappointed not to seal a move to the Premeir League

‘I think it’s no problem. But he needs a couple of days to get this out of his system, get thinking positive again.

‘He’s a player we want to have and we would like to sign him on an even longer contract. That’s how it is. We need good players here and we need to have his kind of player if we want to get the results we need. So that is no problem, that is how it is.’

Asked outright if he worried about the commitment of a player with declared designs on a move, Deila said: ‘No. He is professional. There are a lot of emotions, a lot of thinking, and not so much sleep. The speculation is hard for the mind. It will be good when we come back after the break.

‘I am 100 per cent sure (that he will be committed).’

Training: Van Dijk is still training but missed the match against Dundee as he was not in the right frame of mind

Invited to explain whether he or the player had decided on his omission from a team struggling defensively, the manager said: ‘We talked about it. When you are not 100 per cent at Celtic you can’t play. Then other players can do a better job and that is how it is.

‘There has been a lot of speculation and a lot of thinking for him. He is a very important player for us, a very good player – and we have told him that there is no chance he is going to leave.

‘He is too important to us, so there is no chance we will let him go during this window. We couldn’t replace him. So he is going to stay here.

‘Of course it’s hard for him and he’s had a lot of thinking to do. But it will not be a problem.

‘His girlfriend is also pregnant and due soon. So he hasn’t had the right focus, he wouldn’t have been 100 per cent today – that is why he didn’t play.’

Reports in Spain insisted that Sporting Gijon striker Scepovic, who has passed a medical after the clubs agreed a fee, was prepared to spend today waiting to see if a better offer came in from elsewhere.

Committed: Ronny Delia said he had no doubts as regarding Van Dijk's commitment to the club

But Deila declared: ‘No that’s not my understanding of it. He wants to play for Celtic .That’s a good start.

‘We hope that that can be arranged. We are working hard now every day to get that done.

‘I think the process is ongoing. It’s paperwork all over, things have to be settled 100 per cent before we can go out with anything.

‘Will anyone else come in? We’ll see. Things can happen. We are working all the time to see what the options are.’

Asked about persistent whispers of a bid for Dundee United midfielder Stuart Armstrong before the transfer window closes, Deila said: ‘No...I can’t comment.’

He was more adamant about the prospect of Leigh Griffiths going on loan, saying: ‘He is going to stay as well. No players are going out, it is important to get people fit and players back from injury, get the new players in and back from injury and get them playing matches so we have a strong and good squad for the fantastic games we are going to have after the next 14 days.’

Deila was disappointed that his team conceded after just a minute yesterday, saying: ‘That was a very poor start – I think we looked afraid and we lacked energy. That lasted for quite a while.

‘I am not very concerned by the results. Now we get ten days away from each other, because almost the entire squad is going away with their national teams.

‘It is a possibility for them to get their heads around something else, also play more matches. When they come back, we will know who is going to be here – and who is not going to be here.

‘We can start working with the squad we have, new players will come in and we will be more fit, as well. So we will be a stronger squad and stronger team after the international break.’
