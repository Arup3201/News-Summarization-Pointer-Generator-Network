A 63-year-old man who only leaves his Michigan apartment to make frequent trips to the doctor's office is now being summoned to a prison in Arkansas because he never served his full term for killing his father as a teenager.

The case of Lester Stiggers is bringing a decades-old interstate turf battle back to the forefront as the Governor of Arkansas has called for Stiggers to be extradited back to Arkansas.

Stiggers was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for killing his father as a teenager in 1965.

Back to his past: Lester Stiggers was arrested in 1965 for murder but has been out of prison since 1971 because of the former Governor of Michigan's ruling in his favor

When he was granted a five-day leave from prison for good behavior, he headed to Michigan, where his mother lived.

He's been there ever since - thanks to the then-governor of Michigan who, in 1971, refused to send him back to Arkansas and its notorious prison system.

Enforcing the law: After Stiggers was discovered recently, Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe ordered him to be sent back to the state to serve his time

Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe on Wednesday defended his request to have the elderly fugitive returned in spite of his poor health.

‘I'm an invalid now. I'm half dead. What would their interest be to have me back?’ Stiggers said.

Beebe told The Associated Press he wasn't aware of Lester Stiggers' health issues when he sought to have him brought back to the Arkansas prison system, but that will not make him revoke his request.

'We can't pick and choose which laws that we like and which laws that we don't like,' Beebe told the AP.

'And
once the Department of Correction was given information about his 
whereabouts, and... they requested me to sign an extradition warrant, 
then that's my duty and that's the law and that's what we did.'

The AP recently found Stiggers living in a one-bedroom apartment along a busy road in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Michigan.

He gets by on $700 a month in Social Security benefits, usually making trips outside only to see a doctor.

His life now: Stiggers is 63-years-old, in poor health, and lives with his companion Delphine Hopkins in a small apartment in Warren, Michigan. He is seen holding Ms Hopkins' granddaughter in this photo

He needs an inhaler and 10 pills a day for his diabetes, high blood pressure and other ailments.

A stocky man with thick arms, Stiggers grappled with sewer lines as a plumber until two strokes ended his working days and made his speech difficult to understand.

He was astounded to learn that Arkansas has renewed its efforts to bring him back to prison - more than four decades after then-Governor William Milliken blocked the state's initial request.

At the time, Milliken wrote that the notorious Arkansas prison system was a form of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’.

'No purpose would be served now by sending that man back,' the former governor told the Associated Press.

Now 91-years-old, Mr Milliken said that 
he does not remember Stigger's case specifically but the move to allow 
the young black man to stay in the midwestern state does seem fitting. 

Then and now: Former Michigan governor William Milliken, seen in 1978 at left and 2008 at right, initially allowed Stiggers to stay in his state because the Arkansas prison system was notorious at the time

'Knowing how distressed I was about the shameful state of race relations in our country, I would have wanted to give that man another chance,' he said.

Beebe, a Democrat, sent a letter this year to Republican Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, seeking Stiggers after his Social Security benefits put him back on Arkansas' radar.

State prison officials said they didn't know that Stiggers was sick, either, but Department of Correction spokeswoman Shea Wilson told the AP that it's not the agency's role to make judgments about whether Stiggers should be brought back to Arkansas.

'It's our job to carry out the mandates of the court,' Wilson said.

'And that's simply what we're doing in our efforts to seek him.'

Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, said the matter was still under review and 'there's not currently a timeframe for when that may be concluded.'
