Kim Kardashian is allegedly being paid $1million to spend an evening with a member of the Saudi royal family.

Mrs Kardashian-West is set to fly out to Saudi Arabia in January, as a special guest of the prince, according to reports.

The 34-year-old's rumoured visit follows a proposal made by a young Saudi prince on her Instagram, offering her 'one million per night'.

Expensive guest: Kim Kardashian, pictured last night, is allegedly set to fly out to Saudi Arabia to spend an evening in the company of a young Saudi Arabian prince

A few weeks ago, a young man named Adel Al-Otaibi, posted the proposal in a comment on one of Mrs Kardashian-West's many selfies.

Mr Al-Otaibi, allegedly a member of the Saudi royal family, wrote: 'I'm Saudi and I'll pay you one million per night Mai'. 

Now, 'urban website' MediaTakeOut reports that the mother-of-one has accepted the offer, and will fly out to Saudi Arabia early next year.

The mother-of-one has not confirmed the report, which has sparked discussion on Saudi Arabian online forums.

Her trip to Bahrain in 2012 sparked demonstrations that required police to fire tear gas into the crowds.

It is no secret that celebrities charge for appearances at clubs and parties, but some cash in incredible fees for a show. 

Jennifer Lopez was reportedly paid $1.5 million to sing Happy Birthday for the president of Turkmenistan in 2013.

Earlier this year, Mariah Carey is said to have taken £1million to perform at a private celebration in London for the son of the Sultan of Brunei, and last year she was paid a cool £635,000 to sing for Angolan President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos.

US band The Eagles was once reportedly paid £3.5million by an unknown benefactor to play one song, Hotel California, at a private party in New York, while American billionaire David Bonderman paid The Rolling Stones around £3.5million to perform for an hour at his 60th birthday party in 2002. 

Jordanian news website Al Bawaba advised her to 'pack an abaya', the robe-like dress commonly worn by women in conservative parts of the Muslim world, and to remember that Saudi Arabia is 'as far away from her fave glitzy and glamorous hot spot Dubai as could be'.

Mrs Kardashian-West, owner of the world's only internet-breaking backside, is often paid to appear at parties and club nights.

She famously accepted $500,000 to attend the 2013 Vienna Ball as the date of 81-year-old billionaire Richard Lugner.

After their night on the tiles, the 81-year-old complained to reporters that Mrs Kardashian-West had been 'annoying' and had refused to dance with him. 

'Kim is 
annoying me because she's not sticking to the program,' he said.

It was reported elsewhere that Mrs Kardashian-West had told her entourage that Mr Lugner had been 'aggressive', and grabbing her 
and asking her to lose her security to be alone with her.
