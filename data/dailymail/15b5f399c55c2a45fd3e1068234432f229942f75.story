Pressure: George Obsorne has been encouraged to raise to threshold for the 40 per cent tax rate by members of his own party

Pressure is mounting on George Osborne to raise the 40p tax threshold – after he reportedly said that people did not mind paying the higher rate because it made them feel like a 'success'.

The row over the millions of workers being dragged into paying the higher rate of tax threatens to overshadow this week’s Budget, with a string of senior Tories expressing concern.

Business leaders also weighed in yesterday, with the Institute of Directors saying the system was ‘highly damaging to UK plc’.

But the Chancellor is expected to reject their pleas – instead using the Budget to again raise the threshold for basic rate income tax to £10,500.

Yesterday the Chancellor faced extraordinary claims that he told a private meeting of Tory MPs there were ‘advantages’ for the party that more people were being pulled into paying the higher rate.

‘It means they feel they are a success and joining the aspirational classes,’ he was said to have told them.

‘That means they are more likely to think like Conservatives and vote Conservative. If they are paying 40p tax they have a greater interest in cutting government spending because they are paying for it.’

A Treasury source insisted: ‘George did not say people enjoy paying 40p. He was explaining that even though more people are paying a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent, the important thing is that they are paying less tax overall.’

But two MPs from the Conservatives’ 1922 backbench committee who were present at the meeting in Downing Street last month said the account of the meeting was accurate.

One said: ‘He did say it made people feel they were a success. There was a sense of dumbfounded shock around the table.’

Since the election, 1.4million workers have been dragged into the 40p tax band, which kicks in at £41,450. There are 4.4 million people paying the higher rate, up from 3.02million when the Coalition came to power and 1.35million in 1988.

Senior Tories, including two former Chancellors and London Mayor Boris Johnson, have urged Mr Osborne to indicate he wants to use further  budgets to ease the 40p squeeze on middle-class professionals.

Urged: Boris Johnson, right, has previously encouraged the Chancellor to act over tax

A survey of firms by the Institute of Directors identified growing concern over the number of families paying the tax. It found an increase in the higher-rate threshold to £50,000 had emerged as their top priority for personal taxation and warned the current system was damaging the country.

The Chancellor said yesterday that anyone earning up to £100,000 was better off thanks to the Government’s dramatic increases in the personal allowance.

‘It helps people whether they’re earning £20,000 or £50,000. It’s only people right at the top, people on incomes of over £100,000, who don’t get the benefit,’ he said.

Mr Osborne said he was ‘incredibly proud’ of what the Conservatives had done to raise the personal allowance, mainly helping basic-rate taxpayers – who are better off by more than £700 a year as a result.

Intervention: Former Chancellor Lord Lamont said Mr Osborne 'can't go on forever' without raising the threshold

‘This has been an income tax cut for 25million people. It’s taken the lowest-paid two million out of tax.

‘And the benefits have been felt by those on the higher incomes, on the higher threshold – those earning £40,000, £50,000, £60,000 – so I think that is a misconception in this debate,’ he said.

The Chancellor hinted that he might look at action on the 40p threshold if the Conservatives won a majority in next year’s election.

Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘What was intended as a tax to hit the very wealthiest has now entrapped millions of hard-working people.

‘Aspirational middle-earners now suffer an income tax rate of 40 per cent, plus 2 per cent National Insurance, before their incomes exceed even twice median earnings.

‘This is a completely unacceptable situation. It represents a disincentive for aspiring junior managers and professionals to accept promotions or move jobs and, accordingly, it is highly damaging to UK plc.’

Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont said: ‘You can’t go on for ever and for ever increasing the personal allowance and not increasing the 40 per cent tax threshold, because you’re just driving more and more people into that band.

‘It also is a very, very expensive policy because in order to keep the number of people not paying tax constant, you have to keep adjusting it and adjusting it each year.

‘When the 40p rate was introduced by Nigel Lawson, it applied to one in 20 people. It now applies to one in six people and by 2015 next year, there’ll be 6million people paying this.’
