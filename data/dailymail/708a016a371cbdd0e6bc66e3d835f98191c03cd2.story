It won't do much for its rock n roll image but music giant HMV has decided to ban its staff from showing their tattoos and male workers having long hair.

The high street retailer's new 'appearance policy' also outlaws footwear like flip flops as they try to impose rules to make workers look more professional.

HMV want to move away from the scruffy stereotype of record shop workers, so only 'discreet' body art or piercings can be on show from next Friday.

'If someone does have extensive body art - whether in store or at head office, we would expect them to cover this up whilst working,' a company spokesman said.

Changes: HMV staff will have to cover tattoos up and men will have to cut their hair under new rules

'More discreet tattoos and piercings are not an issue so long as people look smart. It goes without saying that we want our work colleagues to feel valued as individuals who can express their personalities, but it's also important that we balance this against the needs and expectations of our customers, who, ultimately, have to be at the heart of everything we do.

'We'd like to think our colleagues are presentable anyway, so this is just about adopting a more consistent approach, which we believe our customers will appreciate.'

However, this new image has not been conveyed on its website yet, where a member of staff is shown with lots of tattoos and a large piercing in their face.

Police recruits to Britain's largest police 
force - The Met -  were banned last month from having visible tattoos in a sweeping 
reform of its public image.

Got to go: Any large tattoos like these ones would have to be covered up if someone worked for HMV

Scotland
Yard Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said body art that can be seen by 
the public 'damages the professional image' of the service.

And
he ordered a 'tattoo amnesty' in which anyone who already has marks on 
their hands, neck or face must declare them within weeks or be 
sacked.

The ban comes amid increasing concern among senior ranks 
nationwide over complaints from crime victims that some young officers 
appear 'thuggish'.

They are particularly worried about the trend for tattoo 'sleeves' in which wrap-around tattoos are inked along the arm.

But
rank-and-file representatives claim associating tattoos with criminals 
is old-fashioned and police should reflect the public they serve.

HMV's decision is likely to be driven by its poor financial performance in recent years.

Last month HMV’s new boss Trevor Moore spoke as the music and 
movie retailer posted another dismal trading update, wiping eight per cent off the value of its shares.

The
chief executive, who joined from camera retailer Jessops, blamed an uninspiring stable of releases for a disappointing 11.6 per cent decline in underlying sales for the 20 weeks to September 15.
