Nei Lima Da Costa has pleaded guilty to seven charges following a horror crash which saw three people lose their lives

A Melbourne woman watched in horror as her husband was knocked 50 metres by a drug-affected, speeding driver as the couple walked home from their anniversary dinner.

Nei Lima Da Costa was speeding at about 120km/h when he fatally hit Anthony Parsons as he crossed a Melbourne intersection, before colliding with a car and also killing married couple Savvas and Ismini Menelaou.

Lima Da Costa, 30, has pleaded guilty to seven charges including culpable driving causing death, negligently causing serious injury and reckless conduct endangering life.'

Mr Parsons' widow, Sue Parsons, said Lima Da Costa's crime had taken her 'soul mate, confidant and best friend'.

She was just metres behind her 45-year-old husband when he was struck as they walked home after a night out celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary on January 12.

'I cannot describe what it was like to see my husband killed before my eyes,' she said in a victim statement read to the Victorian Supreme Court on Tuesday.

The force of the collision broke every bone in Mr Parsons' body, severed his arm and threw him 52 metres.

Lima Da Costa, a Brazilian citizen, walked from the wreckage of his car with just a broken collarbone.

Blood tests found he had the drug ice in his system.

'I was asking people: 'Where's my husband, where's my husband',' Mrs Parsons said.

She described being in a state of shock by the time she found his battered body and desperately tried to rouse him.

Savvas (left) and his wife Inima Menelaou (right) were killed during the accident, while their son who was driving was seriously injured, as were two other elderly passengers in the car

'I kept tapping him on the arm to wake up,' she said.

'I kept saying 'C'mon honey, wake up and talk to me', but he wouldn't.'

Prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC said Lima Da Costa was travelling 40km/h over the speed limit when he ran the red light, collecting Mr Parsons, before hitting a Ford sedan carrying Savvas Menelaou, 67, and his wife Ismini Menelaou, 59, who both died at the scene.

Their son Menelaos Menelaou was driving the sedan and suffered life-threatening injuries.

Another elderly couple who were passengers in the sedan also suffered serious injuries.

Mr Tinney said witnesses described seeing a 'white blur' as Lima Da Costa's car weaved in and out of traffic and ran red lights on his way from Crown casino in Melbourne's CBD to the collision site in Oakleigh.

His plea hearing continues.
