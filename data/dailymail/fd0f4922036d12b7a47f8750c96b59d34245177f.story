A cheating family doctor is pictured renewing his wedding vows with his forgiving wife - just weeks after his affair with a patient culminated in a catfight.

GP Terence Burley, 63, patched up his 38 year marriage with wife Jane, 62, despite nearly divorcing over his on/off six year affair with the woman.

Mrs Burley paid tribute to her husband as her 'soulmate' in a blogpost about their vow renewal.

She added: 'This was a choice made with mature reflection - we had chosen to forgive and to reconcile in celebration of 38 years of marriage.

'In reality marriage is a minefield of endless compromise and rumpled beds, if you’re lucky!'

She explained that they had first met when they were both students in London, adding that the ceremony where they renewed their vows was 'very moving'

'I remembered the reasons why I had agreed to do this which were profoundly deep-seated,' she said.

'Over the past thirty years, I had raised my brood and rediscovered my 
academic confidence by going to Oxford as a mature student in my 
fifties.

Charges: Dr Burley was found guilty of misconduct at a tribunal today following his on/off affair with a patient

'Little did I know then, that, just with all good things in life, for a 
woman, there is always a price to pay for a glimmer, a taste of sheer 
joy.

'Do all long relationships benefit from an emotional m.o.t? Perhaps, but 
we had gone to decree nisi and back and I do not regret my decision to 
issue the papers because all women must evaluate the state of play and 
take action if necessary.'

The blogpost emerged as father-of-four Dr Burley was found guilty over the affair at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal today.

The tribunal found that he had 'engaged in an emotional and sexual relationship' with a woman - known only as Patient A - while he was her family doctor, but cleared him of 'pursuing' her.

It ruled that he 'ought to have known' she was emotionally vulnerable when the relationship began.

It eventually ended after a fight between his wife and the patient at his family home in Peterborough, where police had to be called.

The tribunal heard how the doctor became infatuated 
with the woman after having been her 
family’s doctor for more than 25 years.

Patient A, who is now in her 60s, told
the hearing the doctor tried to seduce her when she went to his surgery
feeling low about the death of her mother.

‘He started kissing my neck and his hands were going on my buttocks. I felt very, very uncomfortable,’ she said.

‘His left hand was on my right side trying to undo the belt on my trousers. I didn’t want to get anywhere near all that.’

Patient A said Dr Burley was declaring that he had been ‘in love with me for over 25 years.’

She told the tribunal: ‘I said what 
was he doing, that it wasn’t right and that he was a married man with 
four children and why was he doing this at this time.’

She managed to walk away but claims Dr Burley then began telephoning her and visiting her at her late mother’s house.

On another visit to the practice, a blanket was laid out on the floor.

She said: ‘He asked if I would take my top off. I didn’t say yes, but didn’t refuse because I was frightened on my own.’

History: Dr Burley had been the woman's family's GP for 25 years at the Minster Medical Practice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire

Eventually the pair began a sexual 
relationship. They would often split up in a series of rows, after which
they would come back together.

On one occasion the GP announced he 
had left his wife and wanted to move in with Patient A – only for
their relationship to cool off again.

The hearing was told the lovers 
had sex while he was helping care for her estranged husband, who was 
terminally ill with stomach cancer.

The affair came to a definitive end in
January 2009 when a ‘violent’ cat-fight erupted between Patient A and 
the doctor’s wife at the Burleys’ home in Peterborough.

Patient A was arrested the following 
day and interviewed by police. She was bailed before later being told no
charges would be brought. She then made her complaint to the General 
Medical Council.

Previously, Dr Burley had suffered fractured ribs 
and a broken nose after he and Patient A's school-age son became embroiled in a 
brawl in 2008.

Dr
Burley faced allegations of pursuing and engaging in an emotional and 
sexual relationship with a patient over three periods between 2003 and 
2008.

He admitted conducting an on-off affair but denied pursuing the 
woman and was cleared of the charge. He said the relationship developed ‘by mutual agreement’.

The panel heard that when Dr Burley 
informed a colleague about the affair, he was told it was 
‘inappropriate’ and that Patient A must register with another doctor.

A decision will be made over Dr Burley's future as a doctor at a further hearing later this year.
