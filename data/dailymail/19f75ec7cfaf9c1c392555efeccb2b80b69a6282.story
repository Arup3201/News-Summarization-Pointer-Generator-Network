A new 325ft roller coaster that reaches higher than the Statue of Liberty and rides as speeds as fast as 95mph is now one of the tallest, fastest and longest on the planet.

Carowinds amusement park in Charlotte, North Carolina has released the first test ride video of the Fury 325, giving prospective daredevils a front seat to one of the five tallest roller coasters in the world.

The video, which is filmed from a passenger's perspective, shows us that the coaster immediately ascends in preparation for its 81-degree drop.

The video, which is filmed from a passenger's perspective, gives us a firsthand view of the stomach-churning 81-degree drop at the beginning of the rider 

With barely a second to watch the American flag flutter, the video suddenly thrusts us down towards the ground in a stomach-flipping fall.

The coaster, which can fit up to 96 people each turn, clocks in at 3 minutes and 25 seconds, according to USA Today.
