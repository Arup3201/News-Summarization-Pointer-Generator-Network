A trio of teenage boys have been caught snapping photos of themselves dangling their legs over the side of an 18-storey high rise building.

Office workers in Auckland called police after spotting the teenagers daringly sitting on the roof of the 70-metre-tall West Plaza Building on Monday afternoon.

The group posed for photos before wandering to other areas of the roof for 15 to 20 minutes before police arrived, the New Zealand Herald reports.

'Normally you see people going up there doing maintenance and that sort of thing, but it was pretty clear that these guys weren't legit,' Jayne Ihaka, who works in a nearby building, told the newspaper.

'They were probably just having a laugh, but it was a bit scary because anything can go wrong when you're dangling your feet over the edge.'

Police went to the roof and made the group of teenagers come down, but no arrests have been made so far.

The building is more than 70-metres tall.  

'I'm pretty sure it's straight down (from where they were). They probably thought it was hilarious but it wouldn't be funny if a body goes splat.

'Maybe their friends on Facebook will be impressed, but no one in our office was.'
