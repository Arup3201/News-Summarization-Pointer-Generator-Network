Works by artist Peter Howson, including 10 original drawings of David Bowie, have sold at auction for more than £200,000.

A total of 390 paintings, drawings and sketches belonging to Terry Howson, the former wife of the Scottish artist, have been sold in Glasgow.

One of the Bowie drawings sold for £9,500
- almost five times the estimate - and the 10 works featuring the pop 
icon collectively made £35,000.

Peter Howson produced the drawings in 1994 when Bowie posed for him at his London studio.

They became friends after Bowie bought two controversial paintings of the Bosnian war by the artist.

Peter Howson said: 'There were only 10 Bowie drawings and I gave them all to Terry. None have ever been sold before.'

Howson and Bowie's friendship continued after they worked together.

Mr Howson said: 'I had him sitting quite high, on a 5ft plinth, and 
at one point he seemed to doze off and fell to the floor.

'We had a laugh
about it. He's a very charismatic character and we've kept in touch 
from time to time ever since.'

Terry Howson decided to sell her 
ex-husband's artworks to raise money for the care of their daughter 
Lucie who has Asperger syndrome.

The sale of the largest single collection
of works by Peter Howson took place on Sunday at McTear's Auctioneers 
and raised a total of £202,000.

Ms Howson said: 'It was difficult to part with a lot of these paintings but the time had come to let others enjoy them.'

She added: 'Over the years I have 
built up quite a collection of Peter's art which demonstrates a real mix
of his work but Lucie's welfare and future is the most important thing.

'I didn't sell my entire collection and I've held back quite a lot of Peter's work which I hope to hang on to.'

Brian Clements, from the auctioneers 
McTear's, said the sale attracted international attention with bids 
received from all over the world and the auction house was packed with 
hundreds of people.

'Peter Howson is one of Britain's most
talented and celebrated artists and Terry's collection includes an 
incredible variety of his work over the last 40 years.

'I
am delighted that so many people have been able to purchase a work by 
this fantastic artist and in the process raise funds to help look after 
Terry and Peter's daughter Lucie,' he said.

Mr Howson was the official war artists in the 1993 Bosnian Civil War and was awarded an OBE in 2009.
