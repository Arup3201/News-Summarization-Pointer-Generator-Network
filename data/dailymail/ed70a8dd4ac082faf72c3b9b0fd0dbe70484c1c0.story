David Cameron has promised to abolish a helpline set up by the Environment Agency for flood victims which charges a premium rate of up to 41p a minute for calls.

After the high cost of dialling the helpline came to light yesterday, the Prime Minister’s spokesman said the 0845 number would be phased out later this year.

The Floodline number costs 10.5p a minute from landlines and could be as much as 41p from a mobile. The aim of the service is to give details of flood warnings and advice.

The Environment Agency had claimed the 0845 prefix was used because there was no other number available.

Shocking: According to the Environment Agency's website, although there is a freephone number for reporting incidents, anyone needing help or advice must pay a premium rate

However,
 yesterday amid the outcry, it set up an alternative helpline on a 
cheaper 0345 number, which costs the same as calling a landline.

The
 Government has come under repeated criticism for choosing the expensive
 O845 numbers for helplines.

Mr Cameron also played down the suggestion 
from Environment Agency boss Lord Smith that only ‘town or country’ 
could be protected from flooding, because it is difficult to do both 
without a ‘bottomless’ budget.

But
 Lord Smith – whose officials have been criticised for failing to dredge
 rivers – added that he ‘regretted’ that ‘we probably have not done as 
much as we should have’.

The cheaper new Floodline number - 0345 9881188 - has since been released and will operate alongside the existing  0845 number to ensure that people with the old number are still able to get through.

But the PM's spokesman insisted it would be axed 'as soon as it can be done'.

However David Rooke, director of flood and coastal risk management at the EA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We don't make any money out of that. We have plans in place to switch. What we are doing is developing a communications plan, because clearly that number has been in use for some years. People have got used to it and they know what number to ring.

'So there is a plan being developed, has been for some time now, to switch over and we think summer is probably the best time to switch rather than... the winter period.'

The phone line offers up to date flood warnings and tips to protect people and homes from water.

'In a flood it's important to focus on the safety of you and your family,' one says.

'Wear waterproof clothing, boots and gloves. Go upstairs. Take food, 
water, a torch and any essential medication. Evacuate if told to do so. 
Clean and disinfect your property using household cleaners'.

The news comes as the chairman of the Environment Agency said Britain may have to choose whether it 
wants to save 'town or country' from future flooding because it is too 
costly to defend both.

Bryony
 Sadler, a member of Somerset's Flooding on the Levels Action Group, told The Sun: 'It is shocking that hard-pressed flood victims are being charged for this.

'We are extremely grateful to the Environment Agency's people on the ground, who are doing their best to help us.

'But this is just another example of staggering mismanagement from their pen-pushing bosses'.

Another victim said: 'These people are victims of some of the worst flooding this country has ever seen and are struggling to pay their bills.

'Yet when they need help, they have to pay again. It is disgusting and should be changed to a free number immediately.'

The premium phone line controversy emerged as the chairman
 of the Environment Agency said 'difficult choices' would have to be 
made over what to protect from future flooding because 'there is no 
bottomless purse' to pay for defences.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Smith said that 'there are no quick fixes in the face of this kind of extreme rainfall', and tough decisions lie ahead about how protection from flooding is managed in the future.

He added: 'Yes, agricultural land matters and we do whatever we can with what we have to make sure it is protected. Rules from successive governments give the highest priority to lives and homes; and I think most people would agree that this is the right approach.

'But this involves tricky issues of policy and priority; town or country, front rooms or farmland?'

Following a meeting of the Government's Cobra emergencies committee yesterday, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said that 73,000 homes in England had been protected from flooding since Friday, and that the EA continued to protect communities by deploying demountable flood defences, sandbags and clearing waterways.

He said: 'I have enormous sympathy for those who have been affected again this weekend and the government is working with all local councils to help communities recover. All requests for assistance have been met.'

Meanwhile householders have been told 
to brace themselves as further wind and rain threatens to bring more 
chaos to waterlogged communities across Britain.

Around
 180 homes were flooded during a busy weekend for the emergency 
services and Environment Agency workers up and down the country.

But as flood-hit communities enjoyed a break in the bad weather yesterday, forecasters warned there may be worse to come, with winds of up to 70mph and up to 30mm of rain expected today.

Further
 flooding is expected this week as high sea levels, strong winds and 
large waves continue to wreak havoc in coastal regions. And it emerged 
yesterday that households and businesses across the Somerset Levels that
 are cut off by flood water are now in the midst of a crime wave.

Opportunistic thieves are targeting evacuated homes and workplaces, stealing possessions and then escaping by boat.

Looters
 stole 600 gallons of oil from one farmer and two quad-bikes used by the
 fire service. Police are now ramping up their patrols on horseback and 
by helicopter in a bid to clamp down on the thefts.
