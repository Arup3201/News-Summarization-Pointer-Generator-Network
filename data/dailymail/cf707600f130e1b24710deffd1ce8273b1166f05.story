A 26-year-old woman has become the first to be charged under controversial new laws in Tennessee that make it illegal to take drugs while pregnant, after both her and her baby tested positive for methamphetamine.

Mallory Loyola was arrested as she was discharged from hospital on Tuesday, having welcomed her daughter last Sunday, later admitting to police she smoked meth just days before giving birth.

The new law - introduced in the state earlier this month - states that a woman can be 'prosecuted for assault for the illegal use of a narcotic drug while pregnant', according to WATE-TV.

Officials are hoping the assault charges - and now Loyola's arrest - will stop women abusing drugs during their pregnancy, however opposers say it will only cultivate troubled women not seeking proper prenatal care.

'Anytime someone is addicted and they can't get off for their own child, their own flesh and blood, it's sad,' Monroe County Sheriff Bill Bivens told WATE-TV in Knoxville.

'Hopefully it will send a signal to other women who are pregnant and have a drug problem to seek help.

'That's what we want them to do.'

The assault charge is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail.

It allows the women the choice to enter a treatment program before the birth and successfully complete it afterwards as a defense.

However the offense has faced a landslide of opposition.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee says the law raises 'serious constitutional concerns regarding equal treatment under the law', according to ABC.

'This dangerous law unconstitutionally singles out new mothers struggling with addiction for criminal assault charges,' Thomas Castelli, legal director of the ACLU Tennessee, said in a statement.

'By focusing on punishing women rather than promoting healthy pregnancies, the state is only deterring women struggling with alcohol or drug dependency from seeking the pre-natal care they need.'

Just before Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam signed the bill in April, Michael Botticelli, acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy at the time, said the federal government didn't want to 'criminalize' addiction.

'What's important is that we create environments where we're really diminishing the stigma and the barriers, particularly for pregnant women, who often have a lot of shame and guilt about their substance abuse disorders,' Botticelli said, according to The Tennessean.

'We know that it's usually a much more effective treatment and less costly to our taxpayers if we make sure that we're treating folks.'

Loyola was released on $2,000 bail.
