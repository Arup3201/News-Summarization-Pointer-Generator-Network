Passengers and crew faced mid-air panic on board an Air Europa charter flight after several travellers fainted while en route to Tel Aviv from Barcelona, according to reports.

After landing at Ben Gurion Airport this morning passengers told Israeli media that flight attendants were 'hysterical', there was a strong smell of 'gas' in the cabin during the four-hour journey, and 10 people lost consciousness.

One passenger told Israeli news website Ynet: ‘They did not let people get up in the bathroom because they were afraid more people would faint.’

In a statement, an Air Europa spokesperson said passengers were feeling dizzy, but did not faint, after noticing a smell that was believed to be kerosene, which powers the jet's engines.

The spokesperson said: 'Around 6 people had temporary indisposition this morning travelling from Barcelona to Tel Aviv on flight Air Europa UX433.

'All of them have recovered quickly by drinking a cola drink. All passengers left the aircraft on their own at destination.'

Almost 200 passengers and crew were on board the Boeing 737, leased from a company called Flying Carpet, when the situation unfolded.

A passenger named Hilla told Ynet that people on board smelled 'gas' after the pilot started the engines while preparing for take-off in Barcelona.

She said she complained to cabin crew but was told that everything was 'OK' and not to worry.

An hour later, passengers began to lose consciousness, causing people on board to panic, she claimed.

Over the plane’s tannoy a flight attendant reportedly asked if there was a doctor on board to assess the passengers.

One woman who fainted regained consciousness after water was poured on her, but said she soon lost consciousness a second time after feeling dizzy.

She told Ynet that she began to feel weak after the person sitting next to her adjusted the air conditioning control above their seat.

The woman said: ‘[They] woke me up with water, and after a few minutes I passed out again.

'Stewards were under pressure … and [would] not even let us go to the bathroom.’ 

The Air Europa spokesperson said there is 'no gas of any type' on the new generation of Boeing 737 aircraft, so the smell perceived by some passengers came from jet fuel.

The spokesperson said: ‘The smell of kerosene that some people perceived during flight is normal when the engines are started with headwind, but after short period of time that smell is always removed by the air conditioning system.’

The spokesperson said no emergency was declared and the flight landed as scheduled. 

An official from Israel's Ministry of Transport said Spanish authorities are investigating. 

A spokesman for Israel Airports Authority told MailOnline Travel that he was not made aware of any incident on board the plane.

He said the flight crew did not say anything about ill passengers while communicating with air traffic controllers.

Air Europa is Spain’s third largest airline, with its headquarters located in Mallorca.
