This is the shocking moment a topless woman is filmed pulling down her pants and trousers and launching herself at police officers in China.

Boozy Xiao Chen-Li, 30, and husband Sying Hseuh, 28, had just been pulled over by traffic cops after apparently enjoying too much alcohol at a meal with friends.

They were driving them home in their car when the pair, both topless, got into a spat with officers. Sying started throwing drunken punches at them while Xiao rushed to his aid.

On show: Back-up police don't know how to react when Xiao Chen-Li launches herself at them with her trousers around her ankles

Their pals leap out of the car to help as a crowd of puzzled onlookers watch on in disbelief.

The bizarre series of events are caught on camera by a stunned bystander in the city of Wenzhou in China's Zhejiang province.

Onlooker Liang Yao, 25, said: 'It was hilarious, bizarre and disturbing all at the same time. No one really seemed in control.

A police spokesman said: 'Six people have been arrested for causing affray, disturbing the peace, drink driving and the woman additionally for exposing herself in public.'
