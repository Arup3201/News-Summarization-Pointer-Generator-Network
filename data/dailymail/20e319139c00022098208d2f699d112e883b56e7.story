This is the woman who looks so much like popstar Nicki Minaj that even her husband struggles to tell them apart.

Make-up artist Ashlea Sherman-Wyzard has regularly been mobbed in public due to her likeness to the pint-sized singer.

Ashlea, who lives in Monroe, Louisiana, was first told she looked like Minaj by Ray J - Kim Kardashian's ex - and these days the comparisons come thick and fast.

Ashlea has not ruled out turning her incredible likeness to the Roman's Revenge singer into a full-time career

''It's scary sometimes how much they look alike,' her husband says of his wife's resemblance to  Whip It singer

Getting ready for the close-up: The make-up artist has appeared in several music videos 

And having appeared in several music videos, she was even turned down for one in which the Superbass singer was due to star - because producers thought she looked too similar.

But it isn't only strangers who have trouble telling them apart - even husband Kasheef finds it hard to spot the difference.

He said: 'I had a text message from her sister and she made some kind of collage image and the faces were put right against each other and looking at it quickly I thought it was Nicki Minaj, or Nicki Minaj was her.

Having fun with it: Ashlea says she has ruled out Minaj-style butt implants - at least for the time being

'It's scary sometimes how much they look alike.'

But being a mirror image of one of the world's most lusted-after women also has its downsides.

The 28-year-old was targeted by Minaj superfans, known as Barbz, after a picture comparing the two was posted online, with Ashlea receiving thousands of abusive tweets - including death threats.

She said: 'A lot of Nicki Minaj's fans started to see it and when they saw my name on it, they immediately took to my Twitter and started commenting and harassing me and saying "Nicki Minaj is this fabulous person, how could you dare compare yourself to her, who do you think you are?"'

But the South Carolina-born Ashlea got through the online bullying with help from her husband of two years Kasheef.

The pair even played the Minaj track 'Right By Your Side' at their wedding.

Startling resemblance: Ashlea is open to a career as a Nicki Minaj lookalike but she says she 'wouldn't do anything to bash her or make fun of her, or make her look bad.'

'It's been an interesting experience being compared to a celebrity,' Ashlea says

Ashlea admits that both her husband and parents have trouble telling them apart, but is keen to stress that she is her own woman.

And while she isn't adverse to surgery, having had a breast reconstruction after a lump was removed, she has ruled out Minaj-style butt implants - at least for the time being.

Ashlea says that despite her hyper-sexualised image, Minaj is a good role model to young children.

And with Minaj's career going from strength to strength, Ashlea has not ruled out turning her incredible likeness to the Roman's Revenge singer into a full-time career.

'As far as anything pursuing any type of career related to being a Nicki Minaj lookalike, I'm open to things, but I wouldn't do anything to bash her or make fun of her, or make her look bad,' she added.
