Experts were unable to open the 9th century Carolingian pot (pictured), which was found on church land in Dumfries and Galloway in September

The mystery surrounding the contents of a Viking pot has been solved after researchers carried out a CT scan on the ancient artefact.

Archaeologists had been unable to open the pot to see what was inside, but its weight suggested it was full of treasure.  

After undergoing a series of scans, the 1,200-year-old pot was found to contain up to at least five silver brooches and an ornate bead. 

It was among more than 100 objects discovered by metal detectorist Derek McLennan, 47 in Dumfries in September. 

Other items include solid gold jewellery, arm bands and silver ingots.

The find was deemed one of the most significant Viking hoards ever discovered in the UK, but the pot's contents were a mystery.

Experts were concerned about damaging the 9th century Carolingian pot when attempting to see what was inside.  

But now, the CT scanner at Borders General Hospital, Scotland, has revealed the ornate box contains around 20 silver, gold and ivory items.

Mr McLennan, a retired businessman, said the latest discovery was ‘beautiful and exciting’.

‘It brought it all back to me when I saw what was inside the pot,’ he continued.

‘I was like a kid looking in the sweet shop window unable to touch anything being on the other side of the glass.

‘Nothing else had been on my mind for two-and-half-months than seeing what was inside the pot, and then seeing it, there was a rush of emotion and was incredibly exciting.

‘I was absolutely amazed by what was inside the pot. There seems to be 20 plus artefacts in the pot, while most of them seem to be broaches of some sort.

‘It’s a real mishmash of artefacts. Not everything comes across clear as there are different types of metal in there.

‘There is hopefully something beautiful and exciting to look at when it comes out because [the owner] took the time to wrap these items.

‘I’m now waiting on the pot to be emptied, but I understand these things take time and it’s in the hands of the experts.’ 

Experts used a CT scanner to inspect what is inside the Viking pot. The circular shape in the upper right corner is said to be an ornate bead. The dome object to its left is a bone or ivory bead, and the  coil curling from the bottom left to the centre is five brooches. But the rectangular shape at the centre remains a mystery

Derek McLennan, who found the trove, was approached by Richard Welander, head of collections with Historic Scotland, who was aware of the previous use of the hospital’s CT scanner for research. With the permission of hospital chief, the pot was brought in for an evening scanning session (pictured)

A scan of the Carolingian pot was conducted by Dr John Reid, consultant radiographer at the BGH, who is also a keen amateur archaeologist. 

He was approached by Richard Welander, head of collections with Historic Scotland, who was aware of the previous use of the hospital’s CT scanner for archaeological research.

With the permission of hospital chief Calum Campbell, the pot was brought in for an evening scanning session.

‘This work takes place outwith normal hours and in no way impedes the important work we do for our human patients,' said Dr Reid. 

‘The scanner is both rapid and accurate, with the ability to produce 120 visual slices, and is accurate to within half a millimetre.’

The monitoring screen revealed the presence of five silver broaches, smaller gold ingots and ivory beads coated with gold - all wrapped in an organic material, possibly leather.

Dr Reid added: ‘The conservationists did not want to [grope] about and compromise this precious object.' 

The protected pot is shown being scanned in Borders General Hospital. The CT scanner consists of an X-ray tube that rotates around the object. These rays are received by a detector on the opposite side of the object, and an image of the scan is created. It produces 120 visual 'slices', and is accurate to within half a millimetre

The discovery was made on Church of Scotland land in Dumfries, however, the exact location has not been revealed because the Scottish Government, Treasure Trove Unit and Historic Scotland have to make sure its properly protected while the full historical significance of the site is established

The discovery was made in early September by Mr McLennan. 

Fellow metal detectorists Reverend Dr David Bartholomew, who is a Church of Scotland minister of a rural Galloway charge, and Mike Smith, the pastor of an Elim Pentecostal Church in Galloway were also in the vicinity at the time. 

Rev Dr Bartholomew said: 'We were searching elsewhere when Derek initially thought he'd discovered a Viking gaming piece. 

‘A short time later he ran over to us waving a silver arm-ring and shouting 'Viking'! It was tremendously exciting, especially when we noticed the silver cross lying face-downwards.

‘It was poking out from under the pile of silver ingots and decorated arm-rings, with a finely wound silver chain still attached to it.

It was made on Church of Scotland land, but the exact location hasn't been revealed.

The hoard also includes various brooches, ingots and this gold bird pin

The hoard, which consists of more than a hundred artefacts, many of which are historically unique, is now under the care of the Treasure Trove Unit and is regarded as being of significant international importance.

Within the find is an early Christian solid silver cross from the 9th or 10th centuries.

The cross is engraved with decorations that, experts say, are highly unusual, which Mr McLennan believes may represent the four Gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

It was found among dozens of silver arm-rings and ingots two feet below the surface. 

The excavation was undertaken by Andrew Nicholson, the county archaeologist, and, shortly after, Mr McLennan found a second signal at its base. 

Further investigations uncovered a second level trove which is of considerably higher quality than the first.

It includes possibly the largest silver pot from the Carolingian dynasty discovered, which could be up to 1,200-years-old. 

Other finds include a gold ring, and a gold bird pin.

The hoard falls under the Scots law of treasure trove, and is currently in the care of the Treasure Trove Unit.

An early medieval cross was also found among the hoard of Viking treasure. The cross is engraved with decorations that experts claim are highly unusual, and which finder Mr McLennan believes may represent the four Gospels

A computerised tomography (CT) scan uses X-rays and a computer to create images of objects inside a body -  or in this case, a pot.

During a CT scan, the person or object is placed on its back on a flat bed. 

The CT scanner consists of an X-ray tube that rotates around the object.

These rays are received by a detector on the opposite side, and an image  is created.

Images produced by a CT scan are called tomograms and are more detailed than standard X-rays. 

A CT scan, for example, can produce images of complex internal structures and shapes.

The technology has previously been used to scan the insides of Egyptian mummies.

‘It was a heart-stopping moment when the local archaeologist turned it over to reveal rich decoration on the other side.’

The hoard falls under the Scots law of treasure trove, and is currently in the care of the Treasure Trove Unit.

The law states that a reward must be made to the finder, and the reward is judged equivalent to the market value of the items.

The Church of Scotland General Trustees, as the landowners, have reached agreement with Mr McLennan about an equitable sharing of any proceeds, which will eventually be awarded.

The location of the find is not being revealed.

The Scottish Government, Treasure Trove Unit and Historic Scotland are all involved in ensuring the area is properly protected while the full historical significance of the site is established.
