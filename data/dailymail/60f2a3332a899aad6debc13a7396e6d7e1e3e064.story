When snow struck, retired Royal Navy chef Bert Lock came to the rescue of his neighbours at the sheltered accommodation where he lives and went to the local Barclays on their behalf.

But Mr Lock soon wished he had never set foot inside after a run-in with the branch’s ‘faulty’ sliding doors left him with a fractured hand.

And despite being left severely shaken, the bank has not only failed to apologise, but a Barclays employee is said to have defiantly declared: ‘If you want any financial help or assistance then you will have to sue us.’

85-year-old Bert Lock, from Bletchley fractured his hand after being trapped in sliding doors at Barclays

The incident happened last week, when Mr Lock visited Barclays in his home town of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, to collect some bank envelopes for friends so they could pay in cash.

As Mr Lock, 85, left the bank, he became trapped in the doors and was thrown to the ground. His walking frame was badly damaged in the fall and he was later diagnosed with a fractured hand.

Mr Lock said: ‘As I came out of the bank, the sliding doors started to close and I assumed the sensor would stop them.

‘But they just kept on coming and got faster and then crushed me and literally threw me on to the floor in a heap. I went down on my right hand very heavily and the doors broke the handbrake on my wheeled walking frame.’ 

Mr Lock said customers and staff quickly came to his rescue and he heard a member of staff shout: ‘Turn the doors off – they are not working’. Engineers have since been seen working on the doors.

A taxi was called and Mr Lock went home where he sat alone in a ‘state of shock’ for the rest of the day. He was in pain the next day and visited the local hospital where an X-ray revealed he had fractured part of his hand.

The injury has left Mr Lock in plaster
up to his elbow for at least six weeks, meaning he will not be able to 
cook for his neighbour, who suffers from dementia.

Mr
Lock received just one call from the Barclays branch four days after 
the incident – but no apology was forthcoming as he was told ‘CCTV 
footage is being reviewed’. 

His
two daughters, who took up his cause, found they were regularly unable 
to speak to anyone at the branch, and were routed through an 0845 call 
centre number.

At one stage 
his daughter Rosemary Walker spoke with a ‘sympathetic young man’ from 
the bank’s complaints department in Leeds, who said an ‘area operations 
manager’ would contact the family.

Hours later a woman phoned – but again there was again no hint of an apology.

Barclays allegedly said: 'If you want any financial help or assistance then you will have to sue us' (file photo)

Mrs Walker claims she was then told: ‘If 
you want any financial help or assistance then you will have to sue us.’
She said: ‘I was flabbergasted by the comment. I wanted to hear the 
bank apologise to my father. It seemed all about denying any corporate 
responsibility for what had happened.

‘I was disgusted by so many aspects of Barclays simply not dealing with our concerns.’

The family are now considering their legal position.

A Barclays spokesman said: ‘We are very concerned to hear of the incident involving Mr Lock that is said to have to occurred at one of our branches.

‘We take the welfare of our customers and people using our branches very seriously and this incident is being investigated as a matter of urgency.

‘We are not in a position to comment further at this stage.’
