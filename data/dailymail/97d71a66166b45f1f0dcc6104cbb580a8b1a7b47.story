Manchester United's No 1 transfer target Mats Hummels has left the door open to a move to Old Trafford though admits he is still undecided about his future.

The World Cup-winning Borussia Dortmund centre back has been tracked by United ever since Louis van Gaal took over last summer and the club are preparing a summer bid for the German.

Dortmund won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 and reached the 2013 Champions League final but are currently 10th in the German table and in danger of missing out on European football altogether next season.

And Hummels, 26, admitted to Kicker magazine that he is mulling over his future.

'Some days I think I would definitely like to move abroad but then, other days, I think I don't fancy it at all,' he said when asked of United's interest.

'Basically, I think moving abroad would be good for my professional and personal well-being. Eventually, I'd like to leave the Bundesliga.

'I have had many conversations with the leaders of Dortmund, where I know I am a big part of the team, but I am yet to make a decision about my future.

'I'm being open about this because I'm not a fan of those who claim they are staying but, behind the scenes, have actually secretly agreed a transfer away from their current club.

'I will do what is best for my career and what I would like to do. Everyone knows how much I love it at Dortmund but I also want to make sure I'm part of a strong team with powerful players.'
