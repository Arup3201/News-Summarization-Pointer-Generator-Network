While animal lovers can bond over complaints of a dog chewing their prized book or a cat mangling their favourite socks, few can boast about having their camera gnawed on by a grizzly bear.

Environmental film-maker John Kitchin now stands in that rarefied group, after going through the bizarre experience in British Columbia, Canada, recently.

Mr Kitchin has captured and shared the moment in a clip which starts off rather unassumingly.

A grizzly bear is caught on camera wandering along a wooden bridge in British Columbia, Canada

Other bears are also seen wandering along the weathered structure in what begins as an unassuming clip

One bear begins to stare intently at the camera filming her actions, before she slowly makes an approach

In a remote forest setting, the bear is seen wandering along a wooden bridge over a salmon bearing river, where she peers down at her potential freshwater meal.

Making the most of the weathered structure, the imposing creature scratches her nose - and even her bottom - against the edge of the bridge while enjoying what appears to be a lazy day.

Mr Kitchin, who says he visited the picturesque region to shoot an interview with bear biologist Dr. Melanie Clapham, recalls: 'While were filming we had a visitor.'

The 'visitor' is shown meandering along the bridge before looking over the edge to see the two humans sitting by the river as they chat.

Apparently unfazed by what she sees, she continues to sniff around before catching sight of the hidden GoPro camera.

Suddenly, the camera is flipped over before going into the bear's mouth - giving viewers a brief at her very large and sharp set of teeth.

After failing to find the taste appealing, the camera is spat out by the bear, who then proceeds to rub her snout all over the lens.

She then gives the device another flip, showing the clawed paws of the bears surrounding her.

Mr Kitchin, who eventually retrieved the device, says: 'The bear removed the camera from its case and put a canine, or four, through the body. The GoPro (mostly) still works when held together by duct tape.'

While the unexpected moment created some fascinating footage, there's still more to come - provided somebody with nifty tech skills can help out.

Explains Mr Kitchin in a caption on the video: '[The bear] had the camera for 2 mins and the last clip is corrupt. If anyone knows a rescue I'll be happy.'

After ejecting the camera from her mouth, the bear gives viewers something new to glance at
