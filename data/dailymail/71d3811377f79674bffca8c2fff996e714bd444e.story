It all started with BB (Blemish Balm) creams - a multi-functional product that harnesses smart new technology so you can replace your serum, moisturiser, primer, foundation and sun block with just one product.

The creams became one of the hottest trends in the beauty industry and are one of its fasting growing product areas with sales hitting £23m last year.

Clearly catching onto the alphabetization theme, then came CC and even DD cream, but don't bother getting to grips with them because EE creams are already hitting shelves. But what on earth are they?

Alphabet beauty: We've witnessed BB, CC and even DD cream but the beauty industry is always looking for innovative new science, technology and products and Estee Lauder believe they've found it with the Enlighten Even Effect Skintone Corrector SPF 30 (EE cream for short)

Estee Lauder has unveiled the world's first EE cream - an abbreviation for the more long-winded Enlighten Even Effect Skintone Corrector SPF 30.

The £34 cream, which lands in stores on October 1, has been designed to give wearers naturally glowing, even-toned skin.

The product aims to help break the cycle of daily assaults and irritation that lead to hyperpigmentation and dark spots.

Understanding that discolouration is a top, universal concern for women, Estée Lauder Scientists have been  researching the day/night rhythm of pigmentation. They discovered that our skin becomes aggravated by UV rays and pollution in the day and dark spots, discolouration and other types of hyperpigmentation are exacerbated whilst we sleep.

How does it work? The product is packed with an ingredient called Baicalin, which aims to minimise the visible effects of irritation from pollution that can trigger the formation of excess pigment and dark spots

They therefore developed a cream packed with an ingredient called Baicalin, which aims to minimise the visible effects of irritation from pollution that can trigger the formation of excess pigment and dark spots. 

To give skin an overall more even effect, this smooth, fluid creme includes color-correcting pigments that promise to give skin a naturally luminous finish. 

Speaking about the new product, celebrity make-up artist Mikey Phillips said: 'As a great foundation alternative this new  cream is a buildable illuminating skin perfecting base.

'It's packed with powerful ingredients to protect and nourish your skin with long lasting results. As a makeup artist I was never convinced by all the BB, CC and now EE creams but I'm now converted and that's down to Estee Lauder and Bobbi Brown who do it best.

'The cream gives a flawless result without looking heavy or cakey and women these days looking for more protection or skincare benefits in their makeup need look no further.

'Using colour correcting pigments and a blend of fine optics you can easily achieve a flawless complexion whilst protecting and nourishing your skin, the perfect no makeup, makeup.'

Beauty blogger Charlie Lankston isn't as convinced: 'I think a lot of beauty brands have fallen prey to the hype surrounding the original BB cream launches here in the UK – and have become slightly obsessed with being the first to release a new wonder cream that somehow conquers a new letter of the alphabet.

‘Estee Lauder is a brilliant brand and I have no doubt that this product will be really luxurious and effective, but personally I think tying it to the alphabet trend cheapens it and makes it seem more like a gimmick than a great new release.’

Are brands going to keep making their way through the alphabet all the way to Z or will we be zzzz of it all by then?
