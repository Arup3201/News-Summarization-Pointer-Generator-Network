It's been a painfully slow courtship, but the United States may finally have fallen in love with the game it calls soccer.

They have been coming to World Cups for decades, but never has their battle cry 'I believe that we will win!' been so fervently sung.

It has been adopted as the nation's catchphrase as millions of fans - some new converts to soccer, others veterans - have followed the progress of Jurgen Klinsmann's team with an infectious enthusiasm.

With President Barack Obama leading the star-studded cheer squad, the American nation will again be entranced on Tuesday night as the US take on Belgium in their last-16 clash in Salvador.

For the first time, there is genuine belief that Team USA can beat anyone in their path and that confidence was much in evidence as they trained on the eve of the match in the sunshine at Roberto Santos Stadium.

Klinsmann, the coach who has done so much to accelerate the development of soccer in the States during his three-year tenure, stood smiling as his players whizzed around him in a blur.

The mood was upbeat, energetic, confident, a squad happy to be considered the underdogs and thriving on it.

They emerged from the group when few expected them to - beating Ghana, coming within seconds of beating Portugal and narrowly losing to Germany, one of the tournament favourites.

Things won't exactly get easier against Belgium but Klinsmann, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1990, has instilled such a self-belief that they do genuinely believe they can win.

'We made it out of a difficult group and now every game is 50-50,' the coach said.

'We need to be spot on, right now, give everything we have. I am confident that if every player gets to his limits tomorrow we will have a positive outcome.

'We started a process three years ago, we see a lot of things developing on many fronts, but you know you get judged by how good the outcome is in the World Cup.'

The Us will certainly have excellent backing in Salvador. More American fans have travelled to the World Cup in Brazil than any other nation outside South America, while hundreds of thousands have been watching on big screens set up in major cities back home.

Marathon man: Michael Bradley ran further than any other player during the World Cup group stage, covering a remarkable 23.6 miles in three games

In Chicago, for example, after more than 20,000 supporters gathered in Grant Park to watch the Germany match on a big screen, plans have been made to open up the 61,000-capacity Soldier Field for an outdoor screening of the Belgium game. Soccer invading the backyard of American Football, by popular demand.

Nationwide, 25 million tuned in for the Portugal match, a new record for televised soccer in the States. That will almost certainly beaten by the Belgium encounter.

'You can't stop it anymore, the sport is breaking through in the United States,' Klinsmann added.

'It is coming through at every level, there are kids playing it anywhere, but the recruiting office is the national team, in every country. This is a cool moment right now, but we have to take advantage of it.

'The support back home means a lot to us. The backing we get is communicated to us and the energy from the US is transmitted directly to the players.

'With the thousands of fans following us here in Brazil, you can see where the game is going, but when the game starts, you have to prove you are the real deal and get the message through.'

Klinsmann doubles up as the technical director for US Soccer, overseeing the development of the country's youth team as well. His son Jonathan is a member of the under 18 squad.

He is encouraged by the progress being made - 'millions of kids playing soccer throughout the country, it is going to another level' - but his steely focus is very much on the present.

'We are not thinking at all about the future right now, we are thinking about the present and we want to go far', he said.

'The more experienced players like Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard, DaMarcus Beasley, Jermaine Jones, this is the moment, you have to squeeze everything out of yourself.

'Right now it is all about Brazil, this World Cup.'
