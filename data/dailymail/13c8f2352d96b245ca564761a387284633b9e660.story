The Queen's jubilee flotilla is to be led by an incredible belfry barge carrying eight enormous church bells which will peel out across London as the procession makes its way up the Thames.

Pushed along by a tug at about 6mph, the amazing vessel will herald the start of the Pageant, leading the flotilla as it makes its way from Battersea Bridge to Tower Bridge.

Followed immediately behind by the Queen's barge Gloriana it will lead 1,000 boats down river with its bells ringing and churches along the route sounding their bells in reply.

A 94ft-long barge has been hired to carry the enormous steel belfry which will stand 20ft above the water.

The eight bells are each named after a senior member of the Royal Family, -  Elizabeth, Philip, Charles, Anne, Andrew, Edward, William and Henry.

They were all cast at the Whitechapel Foundry where Big Ben was made.

The belfry which consists of the eight bells and a heavy duty steel frame will have a combined weight of more than 12 tons.

The barge used to carry it, - the Ursula Katherine - is currently being used to carry supplies to the Olympic Park. 

Red and gold decorations have been designed by Philippa Broadhurst, former art director for the ITV hit Downton Abbey.

After the Pageant, the bells will find a new home at the church of St James Garlickhythe.

Dickon Love, Captain of the royal jubilee bell ringers who will be in charge on the day, is concerned that any rocking motion could put the ringing out of sync.

He told the Sunday Times: 'The secret of English bell-ringing is for it to sound absolutely rhythmical, but conditions will not be exactly as they would be in church so we are presented with some unique difficulties.'
