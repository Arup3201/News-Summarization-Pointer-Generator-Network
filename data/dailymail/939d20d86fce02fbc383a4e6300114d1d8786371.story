Shocking details of Australian high school leavers' plans for Schoolies have been revealed, which include drinking alcohol all day and sleeping with 'sl**s' and 'h*es'.

A survey done by researchers at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia have collected the responses from both male and female students in Year 11 and 12.

While the vast majority of school leavers wanted to spend their time at Schoolies celebrations 'making memories' and 'having fun with friends', Dr Simone Pettigrew - from the university's School of Psychology - said she was disturbed by the 'derogatory remarks' made by teenage boys.

A survey done by researchers at WA's Curtin University have revealed the wild plans of school leavers for Schoolies

'The boys were very vulgar about their behaviour towards girls... sex was huge part of their experience at Schoolies,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Dr Pettigrew gave examples of things the teenagers when they were asked what they would be doing at Schoolies.

She said responses included 'f**k all the sl**s and drink so much alcohol until I pass out', 'f***ing a lot of bunch of little sl**s', 'drinking p*** and f***ing biddies' and 'getting drunk and f***ing hoes'.

It coincides with a new study penned by Dr Pettigrew and other researchers called Understanding and addressing the Schoolies phenomenon, which was published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health on Thursday.

Their research gained an insight what Schoolies experiences were like for graduates to try and was done for the purpose of helping to shape liquor laws.

In Western Australia, adults supplying alcohol to minors is not illegal.

Face-to-face interviewees - between the ages of 18 and 21 - revealed days and nights of heavy drinking, what boys' behaviours were towards girls and alternatives to the typical Schoolies experience.

One female, known only as Amanda, said there was a lot of heavy drinking during her week-long celebration.

'Alcohol's role at Schoolies was the enabler, the joy maker, the medicine, the object of trade, the breakfast, lunch and tea, the dessert. Basically, alcohol was all Schoolies was,' she said.

It was the same story for a interview subject, David, who said alcohol played a 'major factor' in the party environment.

'From the moment we arrived, we consumed alcohol until extremely intoxicated. We continued until we eventually passed out,' he said.

'And when we woke up, we would start the morning with shots. This became the norm for the remainder of the week.'

Dr Pettigrew said the attitude young people had towards alcohol needed to change.

'There is a need to for us to come up with a different definition of adulthood,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'[Young people need to know that] amazing attributes [are what makes you an adult], not how much you can drink and how fast.'

A lot of face-to-face interviewees in the published study said Schoolies involved drinking a lot of alcohol

What surprised the researcher most about the study was the intensity of the responses were what surprised her the most.

Dr Pettigrew said she knew about some of it from talking to her friends and their children.

'[But] it's probably at a higher level than we believe than [what is discussed] on a day-to-day level with our peers,' Dr Pettigrew told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Also the creativity that went into the planning and preparation for [Schoolies] to win the battle against authority, and the complicity of the parents who were aware and they were actively assisting them to do the hiding.'
