Google was today facing the prospect of being forced to remove offending posts on the Blogger website after a judge ‘opened the door’ for the firm being required to monitor what users write.

The California-based internet giant convinced London’s Court of Appeal in a libel case that Blogger is the equivalent of a blank wall and it cannot be held responsible for what is written there by people.

But the court ruled in the case involving law student Payam Tamiz that it was arguable Google was a ‘publisher’ in defamation law, and therefore responsible for offending comments once told of them.

However the court's decision will come as little comfort to former Conservative Party hopeful Mr Tamiz, who was vilified on Blogger by entirely false allegations of drug dealing and dishonesty.

His epic legal tangle with Google, which was first reported by MailOnline one year ago, has so far only earned him a huge legal costs bill - £30,000 of which he must find within the next two weeks.

Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Sullivan, upheld Google's arguments that Blogger is a ‘purely passive wall’ with no responsibility for internet ‘graffiti’.

Mr Tamiz's plea that Google was a primary publisher of the smears was rejected as ‘misplaced’ by the judge, who said it only operates as a ‘facilitator’, enabling other people to express their views.

Google could not be compared to an author or editor and the judge said he was also ‘very doubtful’ that it could be viewed as a ‘secondary publisher’, in a similar way to a libellous article ‘distributor’.

However, the judge went on to rule that Google and others do have a responsibility to remove offending material from their sites within a reasonable time of a complaint of libel being received.

He said that if Google failed to act swiftly enough, it might be inferred to have associated itself, or made itself responsible for, a libellous post. It would at that point become responsible as a publisher and could be sued.

In Mr Tamiz’s case the libellous posts had been taken down and - although he argued Google failed to do that quickly enough - the judge ruled that ‘the game would not be worth the candle’ if his libel case went ahead.

During the very brief period in which Google could conceivably have been held liable, the judge said it was ‘highly improbable that any significant number of readers’ would have seen the comments prior to their removal.

Mr Tamiz was suing Google over anonymous comments made in reaction to a posting on the ‘London Muslim’ blog.

Amongst other things, he was accused - without justification - of being a drug dealer and having stolen from his employers.

Dismissing his claim last year, top libel judge Mr Justice Eady said: ‘It is no doubt often true that the owner of a wall which has been festooned, overnight, with defamatory graffiti could acquire scaffolding and have it all deleted with whitewash’.

But he added: ‘That is not necessarily to
say, however, that the unfortunate owner must, unless and until this 
has been accomplished, be classified as a publisher’.

The libel claim brought by Mr Tamiz, who in 2011 stood as a Tory candidate in local elections in Thanet, Kent, was left dead in the water by the ruling, even though nobody had suggested the accusations made against him were even ‘remotely true’.

On appeal, Godwin Busutill, for Mr Tamiz, had argued for an extension of libel laws to police the melting pot of the internet.

'Little that happens on the internet is genuinely 'automatic' or 'passive'... the notion that the internet runs 'automatically' or 'passively' is in essence a powerful myth which has been fostered very successfully and profitably by internet superpowers such as Google'

Godwin Busutill, for Payam Tamiz

He said: ‘Little that happens on the internet is genuinely "automatic" or "passive"... the notion that the internet runs "automatically" or "passively" is in essence a powerful myth which has been fostered very successfully and profitably by internet superpowers such as Google.

‘It suits their business model to take and to be seen to be taking a “hands off” approach and not really able to do anything about problems that may be generated by their internet-based operations.’

However, Antony White QC, for Google, argued: ‘Blogger.com is a platform that allows any internet user around the world to create his or her own independent blog, free of charge.

‘It is a piece of computer technology... Google does not create, select, solicit, censor or approve the content of a blog, which is published and controlled only the blog owner or blogger.

Analogy: Mr Justice Eady said the owner of wall which has been covered in defamatory graffiti could have it taken off with whitewash, but added that the owner should not be classified as a publisher until then

‘Google's position is...that it had no 
control over the content of the material posed on the “London Muslim” 
blog. It was not the publisher of that material but a neutral service 
provider.’

His appeal dismissed, Mr Tamiz was ordered to pay 50 per cent of Google's legal costs. He will have to pay £30,000 on account within 14 days, but that is likely to be only a fraction of the final bill he will face.

'The ruling does open the door for a future case where a court might take up the comments of the Court of Appeal in this case and run with them. But we are not there yet. In the meantime, Google and other similar companies will rightly be worried that they may be liable in similar future cases'

Adam Wagner, barrister and UK Human Rights Blog editor

Adam Wagner, barrister and editor of the UK Human Rights Blog, told MailOnline: ‘The court did not rule that Google is legally obliged to take down offending posts once they are notified of them - in this regard, the judgment has little or no legal effect on Google.

‘The court did rule that it was arguable that Google was a "publisher" in defamation law, and therefore responsible for defamatory comments once notified of them.

‘Google in fact won this case, because even if it had been potentially liable under defamation law, the offending comment only had a "trivial" effect.

‘The ruling does, however, open the door for a future case where a court might take up the comments of the Court of Appeal in this case and run with them.

‘But we are not there yet. In the meantime, Google and other similar companies will rightly be worried that they may be liable in similar future cases.’

A Google spokesman told MailOnline: 'Google helps spread knowledge, enabling people to find out about almost anything by typing a few words into a computer.

'And services like Blogger, YouTube and Google+ help users to express themselves and share different points of view. Where content is illegal or violates our terms of service we will continue to remove it.'
