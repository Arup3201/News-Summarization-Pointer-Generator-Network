Two families ended up in a violent brawl after their 13-year-old daughters fell out in a playground row over One Direction tickets, a court heard.

The families of Lucy Brough and Chloe Warley had previously been close, but after the teenagers argued at their school in Hessle, Hull, East Yorkshire, their parents fell out.

The dispute eventually escalated into a street brawl between both sets of parents in which one was badly injured, and the three others later convicted of assault.

Mrs Brough and her husband Gary (pictured) had decided 
to go to Hessle High School for a meeting, hoping to resolve the 
dispute between the girls but it didn't go well and the row between the families then escalated

Hull Crown Court was told that Lucy and Chloe had been good friends who attended dance classes together, but had become 'enemies' after a falling out.

The court was not told the 
origins of the playground squabble, but as it rumbled on insults were 
traded and there was a row about tickets to a One Direction concert.

Jane Bryan, prosecuting, said: 'Unfortunately, as often happens with 13-year-old girls, they fell out.

'They became enemies and were causing each other trouble at school.

'And because of the deterioration in the girls’ relationship, the families also fell out.'

The dispute came to a head on June 5 last year when Lucy called her mother, Nicola Brough, 40, from school in 'immense distress'.

Mrs Brough and her husband Gary decided to go to Hessle High School for a meeting, hoping to resolve the dispute, but it did not go well and they decided to take Lucy home.

Scuffle: The court was not told the origins of the playground squabble, but as it rumbled on insults were traded and there was a row about tickets to a One Direction concert

However, Lucy wanted to go back to 
school later that afternoon for a production of Beauty And The Beast and
 as she and her mother arrived at the school gates they saw Chloe, and 
the girls began fighting.

Mrs Brough said she pushed both of the teenagers into a bush to break it up.

However, Chloe then went home to tell her parents Lee and Kerry Warley, and all three got in their car and went to the Broughs’ home in Hessle, the court was told.

Mr Brough was in the garden putting up some hanging baskets with a hammer, and 'before he knew it' the girls were fighting in the street, and their mothers fighting in the garden.

He said he had tried to intervene, but was prevented from doing so by Mr Warley, who told him: 'Let them have it. It’s been coming for a while.'

Action: When Mr and Mrs Warley (pictured) were told how Mrs Brough had pushed Chloe into a bush to break up a fight with Lucy, they rushed to the Broughs' home in Hessle

Assault: Mr Warley, 33, (right) from,west Hull, denied causing grievous bodily harm but admitted a lesser charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the second day of his trial

Mr Warley then took the hammer Mr Brough had been using and threw it over the house.

Mr Brough told the court: 'The next thing I knew, I was seeing stars. I’d been punched.'

The blow fractured his cheek and eye socket and cost him his job as a plant fitter because of the eight weeks he needed off work.

'I kind of blacked out for a couple of seconds,' he said.

'I’ve never felt pain like it before.'

Mr
 Warley, 33, from,west Hull, denied causing grievous bodily harm but 
admitted a lesser charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 
the second day of his trial.

He was given a three-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.

Mrs Warley, 34, was ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work for the assault on Mrs Brough.

Mrs Brough was discharged conditionally for 12 months for the assault on Chloe.

Sentencing Mr Warley, Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'What a disgraceful day, wasn’t it, with more than one person involved?

Sentence: Mr Warley was given a suspended prison sentence and told to carry out community service. His wife was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work, and Mrs Brough was given a conditional discharge

'I very much hope there will now be peace restored, at least on the face of it, between these two families.'

Mrs Brough told how she had bought One Direction tickets for her daughter and friends before Lucy and Chloe fell out.

Speaking from her home today she said: 'The girls fell out after we'd bought tickets for the 1D concert.

'So we decided we didn't want their daughter to come along with us so we offered to buy their ticket from them.

'In the end we managed to swap some tickets so we didn't have to sit together so we all got to go."I wouldn't mind but the girls don't even like 1D any more. They're into 5 Seconds of Summer now.'

She added: 'But I much prefer David Cassidy.'

Mrs Brough told how the girls became friends when they were just four years old after they went to the same ballet class together.

The parents had also come close over the years and were also good friends, but this came to a head last year when the girls had a huge argument - bringing their parents into the fallout.

Mrs Brough said the girls had argued about a number of issues and said they were still not reconciled.
