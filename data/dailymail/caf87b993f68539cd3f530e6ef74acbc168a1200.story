A toy designer and sculptor has created what is quite possibly the scariest baby bed in the world, modeling the intricately-designed cot on a scene from Steven Spielberg's 1975 cult shark thriller Jaws.

Joseph Reginella, from Staten Island, New York, used Styrofoam to build the terrifying design, which makes it appear as though the sleeping baby is lying on the deck of a boat, which is being consumed by a toothy shark. 

Speaking to CNET, the designer, who is a long-time fan of Jaws, explained that he came up with the unique concept while working on another custom bed design.

'At a shop, we made an airplane bed for some little kid in California, and I thought it would be funny if someone would order a terrifying bed instead of something mainstream,' he explained.

Reginella was given the final prompt he needed to actually create the bed, after discovering that his childhood friend was expecting a baby boy. 

'When I found out my childhood buddy Mark and his wife were having a boy, I said, "I gotta make this,"' he added. 

And while some of the images might suggest otherwise, Reginella insists that two-month-old Mikey is enamored with his bed - and the rest of the youngster's family think the custom-made addition to their household is hilarious.

Surprise! Mikey's bed has inspired others to contact Reginella with requests for their own custom designs 

RIP Mr Peanut: The designer is thrilled that the publicity surrounding his bed design has caused this image of his beloved cat to be shared around the world

Although he originally intended the bed to be a one-off piece, the response to Reginella's work has been so incredibly positive that he is now taking orders from customers eager for him to create one for their children. 

And the popularity of his baby bed has also been incredibly positive for Reginella in one other way.

The designer's beloved cat Mr Peanut passed away during the first week of January, after being diagnosed with an inoperable tumor. 

Shortly before his untimely death however, Reginella managed to capture a picture of his feline friend lounging in the Jaws bed, just before he presented it to its new owners and he admits it has been incredibly heartwarming for him to see so many people sharing and commenting on the image. 

'On a sad note my friend mr peanut passed today, he had tumor that could not be removed,' Reginella wrote on his Facebook page. 

'He is world famous now with his pic in the jaws bed. R.I.P lil man you where a good guy (sic).'
