NHS staff responsible for the Mid-Staffordshire care scandal could face jail.

Police reviewing the deaths of patients at the NHS trust have identified up to 300 cases of suspected criminal neglect.

Detectives have spent weeks poring over patient deaths, and found horrific failures of care and unnecessary suffering.

Inquiry: Police and a multi-agency review believe as many as 300 patients may have died as a result of criminal neglect

Up to 1,200 patients are thought to 
have died needlessly at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust between 
2005 and 2009.

Four doctors and 16 nurses are under investigation by 
regulators, but no NHS managers have been disciplined for their role in 
the scandal.

The Daily Mail has campaigned for 
justice for the victims – and for Health Service bosses to be held 
accountable.

As well as shocking neglect by nursing staff, the newspaper
has also highlighted the failings of NHS chief executive Sir David 
Nicholson, who headed the regional health body overseeing Stafford 
hospital until 2006.

Sir David finally announced last month that he would stand down from his current £210,000-a-year post.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the police to investigate in February

Police announced yesterday that they 
will re-examine dozens of suspicious cases in the coming months to 
determine if doctors, nurses and hospital management are guilty of 
criminal offences.

These could include breaches of the Health and Safety
Act, which carries a maximum two-year prison term and an unlimited fine
for the hospital. In extreme cases, staff could be charged with willful
neglect, which can result in sentences of up to five years.

Corporate manslaughter laws passed in 2008 could apply to managers who were warned about negligence.

Last night MPs and victims’ families 
welcomed the police review – but urged officers to probe NHS managers 
and government officials who knew about the deaths.

Charlotte Leslie, MP for Bristol North
West, said: ‘We are not going to get justice and hold people to account
if it just focuses on the frontline staff who always carry the can – it
must go right to the top.

‘We know people were raising the alarm
a long time before those in government and management positions claim 
they knew about it. Achieving justice for the families means getting to 
the root of who knew what.’

Julie Bailey, whose mother Bella died 
at the hospital in 2007 after she was admitted for a routine hernia 
operation, said: ‘If we don’t hold people to account this will continue 
to happen.

‘These cases are the tip of the 
iceberg but at least we are getting somewhere, and while it won’t give 
any comfort to the families for what we have lost, it will give us the 
comfort that this will help stop it happening to other people.’

She too stressed that the review ‘must
not scapegoat the frontline and let management off the hook’. ‘This is 
not just about nurses and doctors,’ she added. ‘We know from the 
evidence to the public inquiry that they raised concerns, they filled in
incident forms and nobody listened. Although if they didn’t speak out, 
we need to know why.’

Staffordshire police began reviewing 
deaths at Stafford and Cannock hospitals in February, after the public 
inquiry chaired by Robert Francis QC published its report.

Along with representatives from the 
Crown Prosecution Service and medical regulators, they examined 
patients’ post-mortem examination and medical notes, complaints from 
families, and five major reports into care at the hospitals.

Assistant chief constable Nick Baker 
said: ‘Between 2005 and 2009, there were 4,253 deaths at Stafford 
Hospital. However, we’ve identified between 200 and 300 cases where 
alleged neglect may have contributed to a patient’s death and they are 
being thoroughly reviewed.’

Victims: Arthur Deakin (left), 77, who was admitted to Stafford Hospital with a broken hip. He died of heart failure after a catalogue of failures. Ellen Linstead (right), 67, died after catching Clostridium difficile and MRSA

He said the force and the Health and 
Safety Executive ‘are examining whether or not there’s any new 
information which has come to light which could lead to a previous 
criminal investigation being re-opened, or to an entirely new 
investigation’.

He continued: ‘Our next step will be to establish if there’s any realistic potential for criminal charges and prosecution.

‘This is a complex, large-scale review
which needs to be detailed, thorough and sensitive. At this stage we 
cannot be clear about timescales, but we do anticipate that this will 
take many months.’

Emma Jones, a solicitor at Leigh Day –
a firm representing more than 100 victims’ families – said: ‘That there
is enough evidence for possible charges in 200 to 300 cases is serious,
as neglect is very difficult to prove.

‘It is our understanding that charges 
will be under the Corporate Manslaughter Act, and that means the people 
who formed the trust board at the time would be looked at and have to 
give evidence and explain why, under their watch, such a number of 
deaths could have happened unnecessarily.

The Francis report described the 
scandal as a ‘story of terrible and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of
people’. It said they were ‘failed by a system which ignored the 
warning signs of poor care, and put corporate self-interest and cost 
control ahead of patients and their safety’.

It has also emerged that hundreds of NHS staff who tried to blow the whistle over poor care were paid off for their silence.

The police’s announcement comes after 
an investigation was launched into the case of Gillian Astbury, who died
at Stafford in 2007 after she was not given insulin despite staff 
knowing she was diabetic.
