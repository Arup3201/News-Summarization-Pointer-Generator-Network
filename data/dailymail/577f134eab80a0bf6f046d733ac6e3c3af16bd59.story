Britons are 'pre-toxing' in the run-up to Christmas so that they can indulge more come December, with people hoping to lose an average of half a stone in the festive run-up.

A new study also shows Brits rate looking good at the office Christmas party more important than a first date or a new job.

However, post Christmas, we don't show the commitment needed to follow through with their regime.

People in UK are hoping to lose an average of half a stone in festive run-up, with 47 per cent are starting their healthy 'pre-tox' fitness regime in next week in preparation for extra-eating over Christmas 

In a poll conducted on 2,000 UK adults, half questioned revealed that they are 'pre-toxing', but only a third admitted they expect to see their diet and fitness regime through to the New Year.

47 per cent of us are starting our healthy 'pre-tox' fitness regime in the next week, with almost a quarter revealing the motivation was looking good at their office Christmas party.  

Instead of just relying on some old-fashioned jogging and calorie-counting, thousands have turned to new technology in an effort to beat the bulge. 

Nearly a fifth of those questioned admitted to using wearable technology or juicing machines to stay on track. 

Almost a quarter said motivation is looking good at their Christmas party

Data from Currys PC World supports the pre-tox trend and shows a 20% increase in sales of its juicers and 27% increase in its wearable products per week.

The survey showed that women take pre-Christmas slimming down more seriously, with men only thinking about shaping up for Christmas towards the end of November, two weeks after women begin their weight loss effort.

80 per cent of people believe that they put on weight during the Christmas period, with some putting on as much as 8lb from over-eating.

Celebrity fitness and nutrition expert, Lucy Wyndham-Read, said: 'It's always hard to think healthy at Christmas.

'As the work life balance gets harder for many of us, some of the latest health and fitness gadgets can give us a helping hand.

'My clients regularly turn to their Philips Avances or Tom Tom Runners to make exercise and healthy living a little more exciting.'

1. Walking a little faster is a great way to burn off some extra calories. Aim to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour, as this helps you burn fat.

2. In the office, set a timer on a watch or your phone and every 20 minutes, simply stand up and move if even for a few seconds. After 20 minutes of sitting the body starts to slow down the amount of calories you burn, so just move every 20 minutes to keep it fully active.

3. Ditch the biscuit tin and swap for a smoothie and save calories and get your vitamins at the same time.

4. Every day, challenge yourself to burn off an extra 100 calories over the build up to Christmas, this way you can have banked and be in credit by at least 2,400 calories.

5. Skipping for 10 minutes can burn up to 135 calories and at the same time sculpts and tones your lower body.

6. Keep your body fuller for longer by adding in some oats to your smoothies, throwing these into your blender will help stabilise your blood sugar levels so you will be less tempted to snack on the mince pies in the office.

7. Taking the stairs take two at a time, this works your thighs and butt harder and avoid using the hand rail as then you contract your abs more for balance.

8. Music is a great motivator, so create a new playlist and name it 'My Pre-tox Christmas Playlist' then listen to this when you work out.

9. Keep your workout gear on the radiator as this way you are more likely to slip into it and head out in the winter for a quick workout.

10. Apply the two D's which are simply 'determination' and 'discipline' and you will get you the desired results. Just make sure you stay on track with your pre-tox of smoothies and exercise.

Ben Lovett, Currys PC World spokesperson, added: 'Brits are becoming more health conscious than ever and the beauty of juicers and wearable products is that they are easy to use on a daily basis.

'The 'Jawbone Up' for example provides new and immediate insights into how you sleep, move and eat, which will help you make smarter choices. 

'Then the NutriBullet comes with a single-serve cup so you can drink your juice on the go.'
