The closeness of Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew's relationship was once again demonstrated last night, as the former couple dined with their daughter Princess Beatrice in London's fashionable East End.

The happy trio had a quiet family supper at the fashionable Les Trois Garcons on Bethnal Green Road.

It was an unusual choice for the group – edgy Shoreditch, although gentrified, isn’t yet a royal stamping ground.

Sarah Ferguson looked chic - and very trim - in a stylish all-black outfit, featuring a racy slit up the front. Her prince also wore black, in his case a sleek suit.

satchel-style bag.

Les 
Trois Garcons is a former pub decorated with stuffed animals and 
dangling handbags, and serves up dishes such as £25 dish of poached 
ballotine of chicken and lobster, and a £21.50 organic salmon with 
spinach, potato Dauphine, and a champagne butter sauce.

It's been a busy week for Princess Beatrice.

Earlier this week, she joined fellow royal
 the Duchess of Cambridge at the black-tie gala 2014 at The 
National Portrait Gallery.

Holding
 her own among the A-list crowd, which included beauties such as Liz 
Hurley, Beatrice looked sophisticated and confident as she left the 
venue.

The
 25-year-old strode out of the gallery - clutching the obligatory goodie
 bag - in an elegant and understated knee-length black satin dress which
 emphasised her slim waist.

Beatrice's strappy black high heels gave the petite, 5ft 3in princess a serious height boost.

And the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson appeared to have a taken a leaf out of Kate’s book and visited a salon before the event.

Her long auburn hair, which she wore loose and swept off her face, looked freshly blow-dried and echoed Kate’s glossy signature look.

She was joined by the Duchess of 
Cambridge, who attended in her role as patron of the National Portrait Gallery. Kate wowed waiting crowds 
with her breath-taking diamond necklace - on loan from Queen Elizabeth.
