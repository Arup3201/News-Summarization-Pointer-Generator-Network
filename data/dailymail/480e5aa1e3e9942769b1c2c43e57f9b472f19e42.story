They were mocked as 'jackasses' for revealing how they had been 'exiled' from the United States - to Italy's most exclusive resort.

Now the Chilean-born New York socialites refused re-entry to the US, after being accused of 'enslaving' their Chilean nanny, have broken their silence to Dailymail.com - to say that it is 'heart-breaking' spending Christmas in Portofino.

Malu Custer Edwards and her husband Micky Hurley were formally cleared of trafficking their child-minder to the US and forcing her to work in slave-like conditions.

But during a family sailing holiday around the Mediterranean, their visas were rescinded- and the family have been stuck in Portofino on the Italian Riviera ever since.

Now as they face Christmas away from their Upper East Side home and an ongoing legal tussle, mother-of-four Malu has told Mail Online of her despair after being denied entry to the country where she grew up.

'Distress': The couple and their four children are stuck in Portofino, north Italy

The 30-year-old said it was 'heart-breaking' for the couple to tell the children they weren't going to get home for the holidays.

She said: 'My eldest son asked for no presents for Christmas. Instead he made a card saying all he wanted for Christmas was to go back to New York, as a family.'

The couple's elder children Rex, Malu and Olympia, have now missed the first semester of the school year and the Hurleys have been forced to enroll them in an Italian school 'to distract them' and 'give them some normality in their lives'.

Malu, who was born in Chile into a prominent family, grew up in New York until, at the age of 19, she fell pregnant with Rex and moved with Micky to her native country.

But after she gained a place at the prestigious Parsons School of Design in 2011 the family relocated to the Manhattan's Upper East Side. Micky and the three elder children had permission to live there because of Malu's student visa while their youngest was born in the States and is a US citizen.

The family were accompanied by a nanny, Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garcia, whom they had hired through an agency in Chile. But with three months she had left.

Two years later she accused the couple of taking her passport, locking her in their apartment, not giving her enough food while they dined out at Manhattan's trendiest restaurants and allowing their children to beat her.

The Hurleys denied the charges but were ordered to pay around $6,000 in backpay.

In the surrounding publicity a series of unpleasant emails between Micky and a photographer who had worked with him emerged, creating the impression of an over-privileged snob. In one email Micky allegedly tormented his former collaborator with the fact that he was the great-grandson of a seamstress. 'If you were reborn a million times your grandmother would never be a Baroness like mine.'

Hurley claims his grandmother was born an aristocrat in Ireland, although his exact lineage is unclear.

 'Abuse': Custer Edwards claims the pair have been receiving hate mail in the wake of the dismissed lawsuit

But Malu insists their home life in New York was 'very simple' and says she and her husband divided the chores and had no any help around the house after the nanny left.

This summer as the case dragged on and with the stress of proving their innocence weighing on them the couple accepted an invitation to stay on a friend's boat sailing along the French and Italian coast.

Since Malu hadn't left the US for two years, their visas had expired, but she believed renewing them was a formality and she claims she had all the paper work in order.

The lawsuit was not yet resolved but as it was a civil suit it shouldn't have had any bearing on the decision, Malu says.

But when she went to pick up the passports the first thing they did was stamp them with denials as she looked on in horror.

On a peninsula in the Ligurian Sea, Portofino is Italy's most exclusive and glamorous resort. 

It is where Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton romanced in the 1961 as she took a break from filming Cleopatra, and its main hotel, the Splendido, offers stunning views, lavish fine dining and the chance to bump into A-list guests.

The resort itself has hosted everyone from Winston Churchill to Rihanna, drawn by its scenery and climate.

Christmas is low season but it compares favorably to New York for climate.

Today it is mostly sunny and 50F - compared to a rainy Manhattan where the temperature is 39F

The officials would not explain the problem but gave her a code that corresponded to the stated reason for refusal.

It was only afterwards that she discovered the visa was refused on grounds of the 'human trafficking' claims made against her by the nanny.

She remembered: 'I was in a complete state of shock. I lived in the US from the age of one until I was 19. Never could I have imagined that this would happen.

'It was horrible. I felt like I had been judged without having been found guilty.'

She said it 'broke her heart' to tell the family. 'One more way the lawsuit ruined our lives.'

Things went from bad to worse. Within 24 hours of the decision her husband was hospitalized and operated on for a collapsed lung.

Malu describes this time as 'the most difficult experience of our lives'.

But after two weeks Micky was allowed to go 'home', which was by then, a friend's house, a former chapel near Portofino.

And on December 9 they were officially cleared of all charges brought by the nanny.

'We cried tears of joy and relief' she said.

However it will be impossible to forget the 'suffering we went through because of all the lies,' she said.

But the ramifications of the lawsuit that 'ruined our lives' are still with them as they have not so far been granted permission for a reconsideration of their immigration ban.

'All those false allegations were deemed baseless and thrown out of court...it was all a lie, but the repercussions of this lawsuit seem endless,' she said.

With Christmas here it is particularly tough. 'The children miss their friends, their toys, belongings.'

The Hurleys will be having a 'simple' family Christmas she said. 'We will give the children their gifts, we will go to mass in family. We will continue to pray that this wrong be righted.

Friends and family cannot believe the injustice, she said. 'It makes no sense to anyone looking from the outside in. Well, it doesn't make sense to us either and we are living it.'

'We want to leave all this nightmare behind us, and get back to NY, where we have a right to be, adding, 'Our bags are packed. We are ready to go.'
