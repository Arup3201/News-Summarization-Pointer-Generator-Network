Man of letters: Anthony D'Ambrosio, 29, a resident of Wall, New Jersey, who works for Apple Inc, published a deeply personal essay titled 'To my ex-wife: I wish I would have held you tighter'

A 29-year-old aspiring writer from New Jersey has penned an emotional open letter to his ex-wife, which has caused a stir online this week.

Anthony D'Ambrosio, a resident of Wall who works for Apple Inc, published a deeply personal essay titled 'To my ex-wife: I wish I would have held you tighter' as part of Asbury Park Press' new relationship series.

Last month, he wrote another piece for the Gannett paper about cheating, which was read by more than 5million people.

D'Ambrosio's letter, which lays bare the anatomy of his relationship and eventual breakup, has left readers divided, with some praising the young divorcee for his candor while other questioning his motives and accusing him of being self-indulgent. 

The long-form essay provides an overview of the couple's relationship from the time they met at age 18 until their divorce.

‘I never imagined you and I, out of all the people in this world, would go through something so devastating as we did,’ D’Ambrsio writes in the opening of the letter addressed simply ‘to my ex-wife.’

‘Throughout the years, we created the most beautiful memories. We climbed all the way to the top together, only to slip and fall as soon as we got there. And though I may have contributed to that fall, I tried so hard to hold on to you.’

The 29-year-old writer is vague on what precipitated the split, only saying that he had done things he is not proud of and that he cannot undo.

And although D’Ambrosio writes that losing his wife’s love shattered his heart into a million pieces, he let her go to find her true happiness.

Retracing his steps in their failed relationship, D’Ambrosio says in the letter that all he ever wanted in life was to fall in love, get married and settle down in a beautiful home with a little bundle of joy.

‘I guess it goes without saying that you made all of that feel real for me; you helped make most of those dreams come true,’ he writes. ‘I wanted nothing more than to be the best husband, a romantic lover, the most selfless provider, and one day, the world's best dad.’

Courting controversy: D'Ambrosio's letter, which lays bare his relationship and eventual breakup, has left readers deeply divided

Comparing their relationship to a trip to ‘Disney World,’ D’Ambrosio said that after a while their magical journey ‘in this theme park we call life’ came to an abrupt end.

‘You were gone,’ he writes. ‘Suddenly, everything that was so familiar about life felt so foreign. I was lost without you. All I had left were my memories and dreams of us that I knew would never come true.’

In the letter, D’Ambrosio says there are things he never had the opportunity to tell his ex-wife during their time together, like how much he loved the way she answered the phone.

‘You would say "hey" in this voice that sound so innocent and so loving. And it never changed. It always reminded me of the beginning of our relationship and all of the reasons I fell in love with you,’ he says. ‘Who would have thought something so simple could be so powerful? It's what made you unique.’

He also reminisces on how he used to look at his ex-wife and admire her, no matter how she looked at any given moment, losing himself in her ‘sass’ and smile.

‘Whatever flaws you believed you had, I loved — How you'd look in the mirror and always suck in your stomach; How you always analyzed every picture we took together and made me delete them, nine times out of ten; how you'd pace around on the phone when you were nervous. Or how about how you hated to be on video? I noticed everything. But I loved it,’ he gushes.

In the letter, D’Ambrosio looks back on memorable moments in their long relationship, like a Valendite’s Day in Atlantic City and the day he proposed marriage to her on the beach in Long Island, presenting her with a blue Tiffany box that had been sitting on his desk for three weeks in anticipation for the perfect moment.

‘It was one of the happiest moments of my life,’ he writes of the moment he got down on one knee in the sand and asked the question. ‘When I slipped that ring onto your finger, I was certain it would never come off.’

The couple got married June 10, 2012, after eight years of dating.

‘My heart was filled with so many emotions, but I just wanted to hold your hand for the rest of my life,’ D’Ambrosio writes, reflecting on their wedding day.

But then something changed, and D’Ambrosio writes that their lives ‘took different paths.’

‘Our worlds need to fall apart, so we can put them back together the way they were meant to be,’ he says in the letter. ‘There's nothing more important to me than your happiness, and knowing you have that means the world to me.’

The New Jersey man writes that after their divorce, he threw himself into work, found a new passion for writing and has been busy piecing back together his life.

While D’Ambrosio is currently single, he has not given up on love.

‘I still dream of having a family. I still dream of holding my own child. Of course, I still dream of falling in love and finding my true happiness,’ he says.

The 29-year-old recent divorcee makes a vow to never let hatred or anger taint his feelings towards his ex-wife and her family, whose high expectations he had failed to meet.

'My heart shattered into a million pieces. Eventually, I realized I couldn't save us.'

'Our life together — it was like Disney World. We ran carefree in this theme park we call life. Holding each others' hands, we laughed, cried, loved, and we were in awe of everything we experienced. We were children with dreams, and together, we thought about the day when all of ours would come true.

'Eventually, though, those roller coasters stopped.

'The music died down, the lights shut off, and our magical journey came to an abrupt halt.'

'Whatever flaws you believed you had, I loved — How you'd look in the mirror and always suck in your stomach; How you always analyzed every picture we took together and made me delete them, nine times out of ten; how you'd pace around on the phone when you were nervous. Or how about how you hated to be on video? I noticed everything. But I loved it.'

'Our worlds need to fall apart, so we can put them back together the way they were meant to be.'

'As for me? I'm happy. I've found peace. I am busier than ever with work, I found a new passion with writing, and I've been rebuilding a life that was once in a million pieces. I still dream of having a family. I still dream of holding my own child. Of course, I still dream of falling in love and finding my true happiness.'

'I'll never hate you, and I'll never be dishonest about my emotions. God gave me this amazing opportunity to love. It brought me to so many beautiful places, taught me so much about life and gave me memories I'll cherish forever. How can I ever be angry about that?'

'If I knew then what I know now, I would have held you tighter during our first dance and picked a song that never ended.'

He concludes the letter by apologizing for anything he may have done to hurt his former paramour, with whom he had wanted to spend a lifetime.

‘If I knew then what I know now, I would have held you tighter during our first dance and picked a song that never ended,’ he writes touchingly.

‘While on paper I lost my wife, in reality I lost so much more. I lost a piece of me that I will never get back,’ he concludes. ‘Take good care of it.’

D'Ambrosio's deeply personal, emotionally honest love letter to his former spouse has left readers split.

‘As I read this I found myself within your story, feeling your joy, sadness, shattered life, hope and strength,’ Margie Santos wrote in the story's comments.

In a column for Gawker, Leah Finnegan excoriated D’Ambrosio for writing the letter, calling it ‘not only a selfish move, but an aggressive one, with no regard for the ex's feelings.

‘Regardless, this column is not about the ex, it is about D'Ambrosio's pathetic narcissism.’

In an interview with USA Today following the publication of the letter, the 29-year-old Wall resident explained that he decided to pen the essay to find closure and clear the air betwee him and his ex after a period of animosity.

He also insisted that the first-person account was not his attempt to get back together with his former spouse, who is with someone else now.

‘I found peace knowing that she's found her happiness and that one day I will find mine as well,’ he told the paper.
