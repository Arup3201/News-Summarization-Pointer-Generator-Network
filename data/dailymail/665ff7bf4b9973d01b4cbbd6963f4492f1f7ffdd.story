Candidate: Karen Whitefield is a campaigns officer for the office and shopworkers' union Usdaw

Labour last night ignored the lessons of the Falkirk scandal and selected another female union employee as its candidate for the troubled Scottish seat.

Karen Whitefield is a campaigns officer for the office and shopworkers’ union Usdaw.

Her selection comes despite accusations earlier this year that another union, Labour’s paymaster Unite, had rigged votes in favour of its preferred candidate, Karie Murphy.

Unite was accused of signing up local people as Labour members without their knowledge.

But even after the scandal forced the search for a new candidate, the local Labour party has chosen another female trade unionist – rather than taking the opportunity to distance itself from the unions.

Miss Whitefield, who beat two other female selection candidates, was previously Member of the Scottish Parliament for Airdrie and Shotts before she lost her seat in 2011.

She said Labour must now work hard to regain trust following the fraught selection process to replace disgraced MP Eric Joyce – who was kicked out of the party after an assault in a House of Commons bar.

‘It’s time to move forward and look to the future,’ she said. ‘I think this will unite us.

‘We will look to the future, and be out there working hard to regain people’s trust, which they have given to us in the past, and to earn that trust for the future.’

In July, Labour leader Ed Miliband launched a ferocious attack on the selection process in Falkirk after allegations that  Unite had rigged votes to ensure Karie Murphy was chosen.

She
is a close friend of Unite’s militant leader Len McCluskey, and was 
office manager for Labour’s then deputy chairman Tom Watson, who 
resigned in the wake of the scandal.

Mr Miliband said the claims were fuelling a ‘growing mistrust in politics’, but an internal inquiry was quietly dropped in September after witnesses apparently withdrew their evidence.

Mr Miliband has refused to publish the internal report and has rejected calls to reopen the inquiry in the light of fresh evidence.

However, leaked documents suggested there was ‘no doubt that [Unite] members were recruited in an attempt to manipulate party processes’.

The report also found ‘evidence that signatures were forged’. And leaked emails also claim that elements of the Labour leadership knew about and ‘approved’ Unite’s strategy, despite it being against party rules.

Unite has always denied wrongdoing, but Labour put the local party under ‘special measures’.

The councillor who blew the whistle on the claims of vote-rigging was also snubbed in the selection process.

Former Falkirk Council leader Linda Gow said she was ‘disappointed’ not to be on the final shortlist.

Tory MP Priti Patel last night said the Labour leader was ‘too weak’ to stop union influence.

‘Despite Ed Miliband promising to cut his links with his union paymasters, clearly nothing has changed as they parachute in another one of their chosen candidates,’ she said.

‘If he can’t stand up to the unions, he’ll never be able to stand up for Britain on the world stage.’
