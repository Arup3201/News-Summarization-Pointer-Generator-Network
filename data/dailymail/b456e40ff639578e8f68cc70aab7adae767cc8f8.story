BBC Director General Mark Thompson is expected to discuss what he described as the Iranian government's attempt to 'undermine' the service

The BBC has been the victim of a 'sophisticated cyber-attack' in an attempt to undermine its Persian Service which broadcasts to Iran, according to director-general Mark Thompson.

The BBC boss is expected to discuss what he described as the Iranian government’s attempt to 'undermine' the service during a speech to the Royal Television Society tonight.

He will say opponents of the service 'may be widening their tactics' by engaging in cyber-attacks.

Mr Thompson will say: 'There was a day recently when there was a simultaneous attempt to jam two different satellite feeds of BBC Persian into Iran, to disrupt the service’s London phone lines by the use of multiple automatic calls, and a sophisticated cyber-attack on the BBC.

'It is difficult, and may prove impossible, to confirm the source of these attacks, though attempted jamming of BBC services into Iran is nothing new and we regard the coincidence of these different attacks as self-evidently suspicious.'

The BBC has already said Iranian-based members of staff working for the London-based service have faced intimidation.

Mr Thompson will say: 'Arrest without charge, solitary confinement, threats and inducements to persuade their relations either to leave the service or to inform on it secretly to Iranian intelligence: this is how the Iranian government is trying to undermine the BBC Persian Service.'

Mr Thompson will go on to say that the BBC 'believe that there is no substitute for eye-witness journalism carried out by professionals on the ground' despite 'multiple threats' to freedom of speech.

In February Mr Thompson told how there was a campaign of intimidation against Iranian staff who worked outside Iran.

'This is a growing pattern. It's systematic and a campaign,' Mr Thompson told BBC TV.

'What we have decided to do is to be more public than we have been before in calling for the Iranian authorities to desist from this, to ask for other governments to try and put as much pressure as they can and to hope that the embarrassment of this will get those who are responsible for these actions to think again.'

He said on his blog: 'In recent months, we have witnessed increased levels of intimidation alongside disturbing new tactics.

This includes an attempt to put pressure on those who work for BBC Persian outside Iran, by targeting family members who still live inside the country.'

BBC Persian staff provide Farsi-language TV, radio and online services. Few Western journalists are permitted to work in Iran where the hardline Islamic government views much of the foreign media with suspicion.      

Last year the Stuxnet virus, damaged Iran's nuclear program.

Security experts widely believe that the United States 
and Israel were behind cyber weapon, though the two nations have officially 
declined to comment on the matter.   

Iran described Stuxnet - designed to cripple control systems in the nuclear plant - as 'lethal'.
