Cressida Bonas joined boyfriend Prince Harry at the Boodles Boxing Ball held at the Grosvenor House Hotel last night - but the two seemed to spend most of the evening apart.

Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, 
however, were pictured happily posing with their respective boyfriends 
Dave Clark and Jack Brooksbank at the charity event.

Cressida, 24, who has been dating the 
Prince for around a year, wore a simple black dress with thigh and 
cleavage split as she was sneaked through the rear entrance of the 
hotel. Harry, wearing a classic black tuxedo, arrived in a car.

The two were frequently pictured apart 
and were among the last of the guests to leave the the annual charity fundraiser.

Cressida, a young ski instructor and dance student, left 
without Harry and in the company of close friend Princess Eugenie and 
Royal Protection security staff.

The Prince's girlfriend opted for natural hair and make-up, allowing her dress and strappy sandals to take centre stage. She wore gold bangles and rings to polish off her look.

Princess Beatrice, 25, who turned up with her boyfriend, 31-year-old Virgin Galactic businessman Dave Clark, wore a sequin cropped jacket over a cream chiffon dress with platform heels.

Eugenie, 23, opted for a monochrome 
halterneck dress - showing off her toned arms - as she was joined by 
partner of more than three years Jack Brooksbank, 26.

Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson were guests of honour at the ball.

The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, who turned 30 earlier this month, attended fundraiser in a striking black and orange halter-neck dress by Catherine Deane. It featured a pleated orange skirt, warrior-like halter neck top half and leather detail strap and waist belt.

She matched the outfit with black, strappy, peep-toe shoes and long, tousled hair. Her make-up was simple, except for statement blusher on her cheeks.

Pregnant Zara Phillips, 32, who also attended the event, with husband Mike Tindall, looked every inch the expectant mother in a silk, billowing dress which showed her maternal curves.

Previously, both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have attended - adding new kudos to the ball.

The black-tie event – the fourth of its kind – was held at The Grosvenor House Hotel because, according to event organisers, it's the only venue big enough to cope with the growing number of attendees.

Last year, tickets sold out in less than 24 hours.
