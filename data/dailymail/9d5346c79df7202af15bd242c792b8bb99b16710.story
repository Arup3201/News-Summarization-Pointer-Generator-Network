A Greggs bakery based in an NHS hospital is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain, it has been revealed. 

The counter at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton is often so busy selling steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas that ropes have to be used to separate queues of hungry customers which can reach 20 people deep.

Greggs, which has flourished on the high street over the last decade and has more than 1,600 shops, would not reveal which of its outlets was the busiest.

The Greggs bakery based at an NHS hospital is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain, it has been revealed

But David Loughton, chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals, said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain's second busiest.  

Mr Loughton told the Daily Star Sunday: 'There is a cafe in site that sells all healthy food but it gets nowhere near the footfall that Greggs gets. 

'You can understand the appeal. It is relatively cheap.' 

The chain sells a range of sandwiches, pies and pasties - such as the cheese and bacon wrap, a chicken fajita slice, and beef and vegetable pasties - ranging from 300 calories to almost 600.

The hospital trust has joined forces with Wolverhampton Council to tackle the obesity crisis locally. 

But Mr Loughton said banning the chain from the site would not solve anything. 

He said: 'People say "ban the fast-food places" but I don't think that will ever work. We have to change people's mentality regarding the food they eat.'

New Cross is not the only NHS hospital to include a fast-food outlet. 

Addenbrooke's in Cambridge operates a food court with a Burger King, Costa Coffee, Starbucks and pizzeria, and University Hospital Southampton Foundation trust, also hosts a Burger King and a Costa Coffee shop.

Hospital chiefs in Devon have recently told staff not to allow deliveries from a new Pizza Hut - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park.

The move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.

Staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant, with bosses steering them towards 'healthier' sandwiches in the hospital's smoothie bar instead.

A hospital in Surrey has also come under heavy fire when it emerged it had paid £24,000 to close a Burger King branch inside its own walls.

Croydon University Hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years, sparking the ire of health campaigners.

It finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a Costa Coffee branch.

But in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £24,000 to Compass UK, the company operating the fast food franchise.

Croydon Health Service admitted the 'world had changed' since it signed the original deal in 1997.
