If you must talk to your plants, make sure you do it properly, pet.

A ground-breaking experiment has concluded that plants like being spoken to - and are particularly partial to a Geordie accent.

Essex and Welsh tones also bear fruit.

Alreet pet? Plants played music by Geordies Cheryl Cole and Ant & Dec grew more than those subjected to other accents

However, Scots and Mancunians might 
want to keep quiet while in the garden, as flowers and foliage played 
Susan Boyle songs and snippets of reality show The Only Way Is Essex 
failed to thrive.

Prince 
Charles, who in 1986 was widely ridiculed for telling the nation how he 
liked to talk to his plants, should also perhaps garden in silence.

The
fun experiment, carried out at an Essex nursery over the summer, found 
that for reasons only known to themselves, plants don't like upper-class
accents.

Gardening website
owner Chris Bonnett began by creating ten groups of bedding plants, 
each containing around 100 plants, and placing them in different areas 
of his nursery.

At an Essex nursery, the plants spoken to in a Geordie accent grew almost 10 per cent than the others

Then, he and his staff started to speak to the plants in a variety of accents.

Appropriate TV programmes and songs were also played.

For
instance, the plants in the Newcastle group were spoken to in a Geordie
accent and played songs by Cheryl Cole and Ant & Dec.

Episodes
of Coronation Street gave a taste of Manchester, Desperate Housewives 
and Brookside were used for Liverpool voices and the TV show The Only 
Way Is Chelsea provided upper-class tones.

In all, eight UK accents were tried, plus American and Australian ones.

But it was the Newcastle accent that triumphed, with these plants growing almost 10 per cent more than some others.

Mr Bonnett, who runs the Gardening Express website, said: 'It's long been thought that plants thrive if you talk to them so we decided to find out once and for all which dialects they respond to best.

'After just a few weeks we started to see differences emerging with the Geordie and Welsh groups shooting up while the Chelsea and Mancunian plants seemed to particularly struggle.

'We kept all other variables as constant as possible. So the plants all had the same amount of sunlight, water and nutrients.

'By the end of the summer it was clear that the accents had a huge effect. There was, more or less, average growth across the Australian, Liverpudlian, Yorkshire and American groups.

'The Geordie and Welsh groups visibly thrived and displayed enhanced growth while the Scottish, Chelsea and Mancunian plants were stunted.'
