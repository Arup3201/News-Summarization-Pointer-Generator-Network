Just when you thought the news couldn’t get any better for Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley, it did. Just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse for his opposite number Tom Watson, it did.

McGinley’s hope that England’s struggling trio of Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald could find some form at the USPGA Championship was thrillingly realised on the opening day.

Westwood shot 65, his lowest score in 17 appearances in the season’s final major and one that also equalled his best in any of the Grand Slam events. When you think how close he has come to winning so many, it speaks volumes for the quality of this performance, which even featured a double bogey.

Poulter was similarly encouraged by his opening round of 68 while Donald, one of the later starters, was tearing around this Kentucky course at a furious pace to reach four under after 11.

Contrast all that cheer to place alongside the successes European golfers have enjoyed this summer with the turmoil on Watson’s plate. As if the sagas involving Dustin Johnson and Tiger Woods were not enough, America’s highest-ranked golfer Matt Kuchar withdrew from this event with a bad back.

Halfway through the afternoon he was joined by defending champion Jason Dufner, another certainty to qualify for America’s team for Gleneagles but one who is clearly struggling desperately with a bad neck. Much more of this and Watson, who was a commendable level par after 14 holes, might have to pick himself.

McGinley had a word with Westwood about his indifferent play over the summer and asked him to show some form. How does a combined total of 128 for his last two rounds sound?

‘I don’t know whether he is looking for a reason to pick me but I shot 63 last Sunday at Firestone and now I am leading a major, so I think I am ticking that box for him,’ said a buoyant Westy.

Not bad for his age: Colin Montgomerie impressed on his rare venture away from the senior tour

Twelve months ago, Westwood blew a decent chance to finally end his well-documented major drought with a final round of 76 in this event. After a few beers on the way home, the frustration came pouring out in a uncharacteristically coarse Twitter rant.

He’s hardly been the same player since, with yet more frustration expressed at the Scottish Open last month, where he said he had lost his spark.

Since then he’s hit the gym, lost a bit of weight and gained a little self-esteem. He’s worked hard with his swing coach Mike Walker and rediscovered his timing. He’s finally listening to his estimable caddie Billy Foster, who urged him all along to remain patient.

‘I think anyone who ever picked up a club knows how frustrating the game is and how much it can make you swear,’ said Westwood. ‘I hate listening to Billy talk about patience because I’m not a patient person but he’s right. So it was nice to turn a good swing, good technique and good feelings into a good score.’

Eye on the prize: Ian Poulter is another European who impressed on day one

Can he enjoy a good Friday? That’s the next thing, of course.

Poulter’s not exactly the world’s most patient man either, and he’s certainly been tested this year when he has gone from one injury to another. If it’s not his shoulder giving him gyp it’s his back or wrist.

‘When you think how strongly I finished last season it has been very demoralising and the last eight months have been atrocious, to be honest,’ he said.

It’s surely not a coincidence that he finally played well in the week where he was able to put in a five-hour stretch on the practice ground without feeling like seizing up at the end of it. ‘I’ve never had injuries before and never had to put up with taking two steps forward and one step back all the time,’ he said. ‘But it’s time to look forward. This is a good start at a time of year when there’s an awful lot to go at.’

McGinley had a quiet word with him too, and even if it is unthinkable that he won’t be at Gleneagles, he knows he can free up a wild card with a top-five finish or so here.

Impressive: Westwood shares the lead with American journeymen Kevin Chappell and Ryan Palmer

Great day: But Palmer and Chappell aren't expected to be challenging come Sunday

Westwood shared the early first-round lead with American journeymen Kevin Chappell and Ryan Palmer, with Italian Edoardo Molinari and the perennial nearly man Jim Furyk a shot behind.

In addition to those mentioned, Europe was well represented with Irish Open champion Mikko Ilonen from Finland on 67, Austrian Bernd Wiesberger and Joost Luiten from the Netherlands on 68 and Frenchman Victor Dubuisson on 69.

England’s Justin Rose started yet another major badly and fought back, again as usual, finishing with three straight birdies for a 70. Colin Montgomerie, playing his first major for four years by virtue of winning the senior USPGA Championship in May, shot a creditable 70.

The star turn during the afternoon, of course, was man of the moment Rory McIlroy, looking for his second major in four weeks and third win in a row.

As ever, there was never a dull moment. After cruising to the turn in just 32 shots, a wicked hook at the 10th sailed out of bounds and he followed the resultant double bogey with another dropped shot at the 11th. Birdies at the next two holes took him to two under, though, and back on track.
