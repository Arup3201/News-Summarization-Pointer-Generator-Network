Cornell University has suspended its entire lacrosse team following allegations of hazing. 

The alleged hazing happened on September 13 and involved older team members who coerced underage freshman to drink alcohol, according to John Carberry, a spokesman for the school. 

'On Sept. 13, the Cornell men's lacrosse team was placed on temporary suspension pending appropriate sanctions for a team hazing incident,' Cornell Athletics director Andy Noel said in a statement released Thursday afternoon.

'Following investigation into the 
incident, Coach (Ben) DeLuca and his team were notified that all fall 
competitions are canceled,' he added. 'Effective today, the team will resume training and practice in accordance with sanction guidelines.'

The lacrosse team, which went 14-4 last season, was scheduled to play the Iroqois National Team on September 28 in Cortland, New York.

Cornell plans to post details on the reported incidents on a website that is devoted to exposing hazing at the school.

'Hazing practices are harmful and antithetical to our values as a university and our commitment to student-athletes,' Noel said. 'They have no place in Cornell athletics.'

He said the school plans to work with the team 'intensely in the next days, weeks and months to educate them on the problematic actions and to help them identify appropriate, healthy activities in which they can bond.'

'We need our upperclassmen to model the high level behavior we demand from our student-athletes at Cornell.'

Other recent hazing incidents at Cornell, according to the university's hazing website, are detailed below:

Chi Psi Fraternity Interfraternity Council chapter

The school received reports that new members of Chi Psi Fraternity, during the Spring 2013 semester, were hazed by the members of the fraternity. Activities included menial tasks, including chores and other duties and favors for members, such as driving services. They were expected to spend a large amount of time in the basement of the house, where they sometimes ate meals, slept on hard surfaces, and were subjected to repeated loud music and they were required to walk backward when going up stairs. 

The new members were required to travel to Chi Psi chapters on other campuses where they were demeaned and exposed to mentally/emotionally abusive treatment, including being pressured to consume a concoction of beer and pickle juice meant to mislead them to believe it was urine.

Delta Phi Interfraternity Council chapter

The Delta Phi fraternity forced new members and a few current members to take part in what was called a 'safari,' in which the participants ran around the exterior of the fraternity house looking for characters placed in the yard while being sprayed periodically with a garden hose and yelled at by the organizers. This activity took place under winter weather-like conditions.

Lambda Theta Phi Multicultural Greek Letter Council chapter

The school received an anonymous report on Feb. 6, 2013, regarding Lambda Theta Phi fraternity events that occurred on Nov. 4, 2012. The allegations of hazing involved 'line-ups', not allowing new members to use public transportation, requiring uniforms to be worn at all times, forcing new members to shave their heads, and limiting the contact new members were allowed to have with people outside of the fraternity.

Sigma Lambda Upsilon Multicultural Greek Letter Council chapter

The school received a report from an anonymous person on February 6, 2013, regarding Sigma Lambda Upsilon and activities taking place during the fall 2012 semester. The report alleged that the new members weren't allowed to wash their hair, wear anything except an agreed-upon uniform, or socialize outside of academic related activities.

The headline sounds like all the players were suspended from the university, but the only thing that happened is their fall games were cancelled.
