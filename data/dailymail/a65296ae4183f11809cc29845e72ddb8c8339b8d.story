With her neat blonde hair and shoulder-grazing earrings, Flavia Froese doesn't look particularly intimidating but to Rio de Janero's crack dealers, that's exactly what she is.

Brazil has the biggest crack problem in the world, with drugs worth 10 million dollars sold every single day and addicts on every corner in the country's slums and shanty towns.

Worse, the crack epidemic has led to spiralling crime rates with murder rates on the increase as drug dons compete for their share of the lucrative trade.

Flavia, however, is one of a growing number of Brazilians with plans to to something about the crack epidemic and says the Government should start taking it more seriously.

Currently, the Brazilian Government's solution to the crack problem is to 'pacify' the favelas - using the police and army to drive out the dealers and addicts - but so far, only in 30, all in tourist areas, out of 1000, has the policy been implemented.

'Crack here in Rio is treated like a 
security risk rather than the public health issue it is,' she explains.

'Without a doubt
 there is a policy of social cleansing. All they are doing is sweeping 
dirt under the carpet. The Olympic legacy in Brazil will be an army of 
zombie crack users.'

Most of Rio's addicts are concentrated in the favelas and in these 'crack lands' can be seen openly smoking the drug on the street.

But while the dealers are lining their pockets, for those addicted to the drug, the only thing crack produces is misery.

'I'm here looking for my son, he's a 
crack user,' says one woman who was filmed entering the favela in her Sunday best for Ross Kemp's Extreme World series.

'I have been struggling with this for five years, all because
 of this godforsaken crack. Lots of mothers go through this.

'It hurts 
when I see them like this sleeping rough, covered in mud, dirty and 
hungry, I won't give up, he's my son, I can't abandon him.

'I have roses 
as a pledge, I put them in church for him, I love my son so much. I have
 faith in my God, I will see my son transformed.'

Flavia, meanwhile has focused her 
efforts on persuading the drug barons, many of whom are clients 
represented by her law firm, to give up selling crack.

'We
 are here on a mission to give drug dealers a conscience, to get them to
 stop selling crack,' she tells Kemp as they wander through one of the 
unpacified favelas.

'The
 motivation to change this problem has to come from their own experience
 because a lot of these drug dealers have relatives who use crack so 
it's very real for them. They see the destruction that crack causes in the 
community.

'On the other hand there is of course the issue of profit which is why we haven't yet stopped the sale of crack.'

And her fears appear to be borne out. Filmed meeting with one of the drug dons, she is told, in no uncertain terms, that if he doesn't sell crack, someone else will.

'The problem is that we rely on this,' he adds. 'I earn 
$10,000 a month but the average salary is $160. There's no comparison.

He adds: 'You 
have to explain that that as long as there's corruption, this won't 
stop. Corruption in this country is shameless. They hide behind masks, 
they hide behind everything. We line their pockets and they leave us to 
sell.'

Flavia herself hopes that the dealers will eventually give up selling crack - even if that means switching to selling other drugs instead.

'I'm not condoning drugs,' she adds. 'I think all drugs are bad.' But with six million Brazilian adults willing to admit they've tried the substance, it's clear that something needs to be done about Brazil's crack epidemic.
