Ahead of the opening weekend of the RBS 6 Nations, Sportsmail introduces you to some of the wives and girlfriends who will be supporting their partners during this year's tournament.

SCOTLAND: RICHIE GRAY AND ELLIE MCKEATING 

After Scotland's much-improved display during the November Tests, Glasgow lock Richie Gray will be hoping for much better from his team this time round following his side's poor displays last season. 

Off the field, Gray is dating model Ellie McKeating, who represented Scotland at the Miss World 2014 competition. 

Born and raised in Glasgow, McKeating will be cheering on Gray from the sidelines during Scotland's tilt for the title.

ENGLAND: MIKE BROWN AND ELIZA WOODCOCK 

Mike Brown was named Six Nations player of the tournament last season and the Harlequins fullback can count on partner Eliza Woodcock's suppprt for the forthcoming campaign. 

Fashion designer Eliza, daughter of Nottingham Forest legend Tony Woodcock, and Brown plan to marry in 2016. 

The couple were hoping to tie the knot earlier, but pushed the date back so not to interfere with Brown's preparations for the forthcoming World Cup in September.

WALES: LEIGH HALFPENNY AND JESS TUMELTY 

Leigh Halfpenny is one of the world's most accurate goalkickers and will be central to Wales' chances during the championship. 

Off the field, Halfpenny shares his life with Jess Tumelty. 

Tumelty regularly attends Halfpenny's games for Toulon at the Stade Felix Mayol and is sure to be watching on during the full-back's exploits at the Millenium Stadium over the coming weeks.

IRELAND: GORDON D'ARCY AND AOIFE COGAN  

Gordon D'Arcy has been left out of Ireland's Six Nations opener against Italy in Rome, but don't write off the veteran centre making a comeback at some stage during the tournament. 

D'Arcy has been married to Irish model Aoife Cogan since July 2012. The Leinster centre tied the knot with Cogan following Ireland's three-Test summer tour of New Zealand earlier that year. 

The couple are currently expecting their first child.

The South African-born scrum-half will make his first start for France in their Six Nations opener against Scotland on Saturday in Paris.
