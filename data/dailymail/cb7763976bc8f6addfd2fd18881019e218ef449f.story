Donald Trump has called the alleged racist remarks made by Donald Sterling 'despicable', but said the woman who recorded the conversation is the 'girlfriend from hell'.

No stranger to controversy himself, the billionaire property mogul said that LA Clippers owner Sterling, 'got set up by a very, very bad girlfriend, let's face it.'

Speaking on Fox & Friends, Trump, 67, expressed sympathy for Sterling, 80, speculating that his fellow billionaire was struggling mentally and was taken advantage of by Vanessa Stiviano.

Trump waded into the Donald Sterling controversy on Monday but was later hammered for an offhand comment he made -- one he stands by

Sterling has been widely condemned after the release of an audio recording in which he allegedly tells Stiviano, 31, that she cannot bring black people to his games and not to be photographed with black people.

Sterling can be heard specifically talking about Magic Johnson - telling Stiviano, who is black and Mexican, that he doesn't want her 'associating with black people.'

'She’s called the girlfriend from hell, but what he said was terrible and despicable and very strong action is going to be taken. There’s no question about it,' Trump said of Stiviano.

'She’s a terrible human being and he gave horrible answers and disgusting answers.'

'But what he said was terrible, it was despicable and very strong action is going to be taken, there is no question about it.'

Trump also raised the possibility of mitigating circumstances for Sterling, questioning his mental abilities and how he could be led on by someone 'so obviously looking to do harm to him.'

He added that in his opinion, Sterling seemed close to 'incompetent.'

'I think he could be out of it, frankly, based on his actions,' Trump said. 'He could be pretty much out of it in terms of his whole mentality.'

Trump said he expects “extremely strong action” from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.

This comes as the NAACP wants a meeting with NBA commissioner Adam Silver to discuss Clippers owner Donald Sterling and the racist comments he allegedly made in a recorded conversation.

The announcement was made Tuesday morning by Roslyn M. Brock, the chair of the NAACP National Board of Directors. She says the NAACP wants to talk to Silver about what it calls, quote, 'the influence and impact of racism in the National Basketball Association.'

This comes as the organization's Los Angeles chapter withdrew its decision to give Sterling a lifetime achievement award, and returned money he donated. Brock says the situation reminds us "racism and bigotry are still alive and well in all corners of society."

The NBA is scheduled to announce later Tuesday the result of its investigation into Sterling's alleged remarks.
