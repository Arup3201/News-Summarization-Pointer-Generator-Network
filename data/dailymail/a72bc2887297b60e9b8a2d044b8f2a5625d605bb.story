Tragic: Tameria Greene, pictured, was stabbed to death last week and her mother, Semeria, has been charged with her murder

The younger brother of an eight-year-old girl who was allegedly stabbed to death by her mother told children's advocacy workers he witnessed the murder.

Semeria Greene is charged with murder in the December 30 slaying of her daughter Tameria.

A petition filed on Monday in Wayne County Juvenile Court stated the boy, four, said that his mother 'had a big knife and cut his sister and his mother killed Ti-Ti'.

Greene has three other sons who the state are petitioning to take from her permanently.

Michigan Child Protective services tried for two years to remove Tameria Greene and her four younger brothers from their mother's care, even petitioning the court as recently as November.

Greene was charged last Wednesday with felony murder and first-degree child abuse and her four sons have been turned over to Child Protective Services, police spokeswoman Sgt Eren Stephens said.

Neighbors called police to the Greene family's apartment in the Martin Luther King block just east of downtown Detroit in the early hours of Sunday morning.

When officers arrived at 2.42am, they found Tameria bleeding and unresponsive on the floor, having been stabbed in the chest, and recovered three bloodied kitchen knives that were scattered around her.

The little girl was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and Semeria Greene was taken into custody. The hospital told police Tameria also had bruises, possible bite marks and scratches on her face.

'This is only the second day of the year and we are charging a parent with a child homicide,' said Kym Worthy, county prosecutor. 'This case is made even more profoundly sad because today would have been Tameria's ninth birthday.'

Semeria Greene's family don't believe she killed her daughter and claim police should be questioning Greene's allegedly abusive partner, Jovan Mull, who is the father of three of the boys.

'There's no way (Semeria was responsible). My sister did not even like to whoop her kids,' Tanisha Robinson told Fox 2 News. 'Jovan Mull, he should be arrested. He fled the scene of a crime,' she added.

According to the Detroit Free Press, Greene told police her daughter had been making sandwiches in the kitchen when she heard a knock at the door.

It's
unclear what happened next, but Greene said she then saw Tameria lying 
dead on the living room floor. The police report says there was no 
evidence the girl was making sandwiches.

Greene had blood on her shirt and sock and was giving her daughter CPR when police arrived, according to reports. Police said she was uncooperative after her arrest, refusing to walk and pretending to fall asleep. They said her breath 'smelled of metabolizing alcohol.'

According to the Free Press,
officers found a bloody knife by the sink in the house, a folding knife
on top of the refrigerator and a butcher knife between couch cushions.

They also found a dried blood shoe print in the dining room and dried 
blood in the living room.

Greene
had a bruise under her eye when police arrived at the apartment, which 
relatives said may have occurred at the hands of her abusive partner.

State child welfare workers have known 
of problems with the family for at least two years and have 
unsuccessfully tried to take Greene's children into protective custody, 
said Michigan Department of Human Services Director Maura Corrigan.

Corrigan said an expedited internal 
review after the death showed that case workers have been trying to 
protect the children and act on concerns raised by family, friends and 
neighbors.

'Most recently, DHS petitioned the court on November 28, unsuccessfully, to remove Tameria and her siblings from her mother's home,' Corrigan said in a statement.Â 

It's not immediately clear why the court blocked the state's attempts to remove the children from Green's care.

Corrigan said the department 'continued to provide court-ordered counseling services to the family as well as conducting in-home visits, the last of which occurred only two days before Tameria's death.'

'We share the grief felt by her loved ones and her community,' the woman said.

Tameria's 7, 4, 2 and 1-year-old brothers now are in foster care. A motive for the stabbing was not clear.

Neighbor Kimyatta Craigmiles told The Detroit News that she had earlier seen Greene arguing with a man in the complex's parking lot.

According to the Detroit Free Press, 
police had contact with Greene over allegations of child abuse and 
neglect, as well as the previous visits from Children's Protective 
Services.

Greene
had taken Tameria to Children's Hospital of Michigan in October with 
bruises on her body and told hospital officials an incident had occurred
at school, a report said.

Neighbors noted how the mother would leave her children alone at times and was abusive. She had reported checked her self into a mental health clinic in the past.

Court records show that Greene's sister was given guardianship of Tameria and at least one of her brothers in 2007, but they were returned to their mother in January 2008.

Minister Craig Fuqua Bey, who will be conducting Tameria's funeral service next week, told the Free Press Greene was a loving mother.

'She loved her children,' he said, 'and her children loved her.'

Neighbors adorned the family's porch and front door at the Martin Luther King Apartments with balloons and stuffed animals in the girl's memory.

Greene is scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole if convicted of murder. The child abuse charge carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.
