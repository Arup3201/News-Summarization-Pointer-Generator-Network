Not content with luring bargain-conscious shoppers away from the bigger supermarkets with cheap groceries and deli items, Lidl has also entered the worlds of fashion and beauty.

Four years ago, the store's £4 perfume, Suddenly Madame Glamour, outshone Chanel’s £61 Coco Mademoiselle in a trial. Then in 2013, beauty experts raved about the brand’s £1.99 BB cream.  

And now, the German supermarket giant wants to style us for spring as it unveils a  fashion range that caters to 'savvy style hunters'.

Cut-price supermaket Lidl has unveiled its spring fashion range, which FEMAIL writer Bianca London put to the test for a weekend away in the countryside. So, can you style a mini-break for under £50?

Intrigued by a bargain, FEMAIL put the new range to the test on a weekend away in the countryside to ascertain whether you really can style a three-day break for £50.

Following the sell-out success of its autumn fashion range in August 2014, Lidl's new collection, which hits stores on February 26, is inspired by Venice. 

Named See You in Venice, the range - which is the first of four  to launch this year - is full of Breton tops, jeggings and soft jersey dresses that can be dressed for day or night.

For a country walk, the £4.99 jeggings, £5.99 pumps, £5.99 knit jumper and £15 trench work well, and for £25.98 for the whole look, Bianca was very impressed

For an al fresco lunch come spring, the £6.99 nautical dress, £15 trench coat and £5.99 pumps are ideal. The dress was very loose-fitted, which I preferred, but some people would no doubt rather a more fitted option

For lounging around the house, the £4.99 jeggings and £3.99 vests are ideal. The jeggings (jean leggings) are comfortable and come with an elasticated waistband. I opted for the blue vest because the white vest was slightly see-through so ensure you're wearing a neutral bra.

This outfit can be dressed up for lunch with the girls by pulling on a £5.99 Breton top and slipping on the practical but stylish £5.99 ballerina pumps. I often find new pumps painful and they sometimes require 'breaking in' but these slipped on with ease.

If lunch is a more formal affair, the £6.99 nautical dress teamed with the £14.99 trench coat works well. 

For me, the trench was the highlight of the range and while it's no Burberry coat, it was perfect for the warmer months and very well cut. Likewise, the £5.99 navy and cream knit jumper was comfortable and could easily become one of my wardrobe staples come spring. 

I wasn't keen on  the £6.99 red dress, which was far from flattering on my size 12 frame; teamed with the pumps, it did little to accentuate my figure

For dinner, the red dress wasn't quite smart enough for my liking but thanks to its jersey material and fit, it was comfortable, at least

Less successful was the £6.99 red dress, which was far from flattering on my size 12 frame. Plus, as someone who wears heels on a daily basis, the pumps did little for my silhouette so I'd like to see Lidl branch out with its footwear offering.

Ultimately, it's cheap as chips. The best value item is a pair of black leggings, which are £2.99, and an entire outfit - including top, bottoms, coat and shoes - can be bought for under £30.

Speaking about the range, a Lidl spokesperson said: 'As we see increased demand for fashion forward clothing at great value, it’s an exciting step for us to launch our second complete women’s fashion collection.

'With more choice than ever before, customers can purchase a whole outfit from us without the big price tag. Last year, items flew off the shelves within days of going on sale so we’d advise customers to get down to stores to snap up a bargain quick.'    

The final verdict? While I wouldn't rock head-to-toe Lidl, I would most certainly mix and match budget fashion gems, such as the trench coat, with a Zara blouse and trousers. The range essentially offers useful staples at an extraordinary price, even giving Primark a run for its money.

Lidl will be adding four more drops to their clothing range - and sunglasses and statement necklaces make up the latest collection

The collection can be styled from day, left, to night, right, and no look will set you back more than £30
