A choirmaster who allegedly raped a pupil at a leading private school told the girl that she 'bewitched him' while grooming her, a court heard today.

Former National Youth Choir director Michael Brewer is accused of tying the girl to a 
bed with a belt before being told by his wife Hilary to 
‘show her what he’d done to her’.

The pair, both 68, are on trial over sex offences dating back more than 30 years, with the former choirmaster alleged to have had a two-year teacher-pupil 
affair.

Trial: Michael Brewer appeared at Manchester Crown Square Crown Court charged with rape and six counts of indecent assault following a police investigation, along with his wife Hilary Brewer

The alleged victim detailed how their
 relationship progressed in 1978 when she was aged 14 from hugs in his 
school office to kisses, intimate touching and then full sex.

Giving evidence at Manchester Crown Court today, she said: 'Very quickly Mike would 
tell me that I bewitched him. That he found me irresistible, that he 
found me wise and wonderful, hugely talented and that these feelings 
could not be wrong because they felt so right.

The former pupil told the 
court that she had felt 'nurtured in many ways' and that Brewer made her
 feel 'special' and 'flattered'.

She added: 'I did not feel at the 
time I was a victim. It was a relationship that developed in a 
completely normal way. We would kiss, he would touch me.'

Nurtured: The former pupil, giving evidence at Manchester Crown Court, said that Michael Brewer told her she 'bewitched him'

She told the jury she had not had any normal relationships at that stage after being abused by an uncle at a much earlier age.

'I now realise I was at the hands of paedophiles,' she said.

Most of the abuse was said to have taken place in his office and his camper van which was parked on the grounds of Chetham’s 
School in Manchester.

She said the pair would often go into
 the van together and said 'it was very easy for a teacher to take a 
student out of school in those days'.

The woman added: 'He liked me to perform oral sex on him when he drove.'

She said their relationship 'intensified' when she was 15, becoming more obvious to others at the school.

Sexual relations also took place when
 she visited the then Brewer family home in Chorlton, Manchester, as his
 ex-wife and children slept upstairs, she alleged.

She eventually left the school to 
study abroad but received a stream of letters from Brewer who signed 
them Mat - which she said stood for Middle Aged Teacher.

'I had almost daily letters telling 
me how much he loved me, how he missed me, he was going to leave his 
wife when the time was right,' she explained.

Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, previously told 
the court Brewer was a brilliant and charismatic teacher whose only 
problem was that he ‘could not keep his hands off’ the girls at the school.

Prestigious: Brewer was director of music at the renowned Chetham's School in Manchester until 1994

The alleged abuse culminated when she 
visited the couple at home aged 18 and was told Mrs Brewer knew of the 
affair. Mrs Brewer is said to have told the teenager ‘she had always 
wanted a sexual relationship with a woman’ and that the girl ‘owed her’ 
because of what had happened with her husband.

The girl was taken upstairs and forced
 to take part in a sex act by Mrs Brewer, who displayed a ‘great 
thrill’, said Mr Cadwallader.

She was loosely tied to a bed using a 
belt, the jury was told, before Mrs Brewer told her husband to ‘show her
 what he’d done’ to her, and the pair had sex.

Brewer went on to target at least two more girls, the court was told, one of which resulted in a sexual affair.

The first, a boarder at Chetham’s at 
the same time as the alleged victim, was said to have been propositioned
 during a school trip when she was 17.

Brewer pinned her up against the wall 
in a dark corridor and told her ‘You want it really, don’t you?’, Mr 
Cadwallader said. But she told him to ‘**** off’, ducked out of the way 
and ran back to her dormitory, he said.

Around 15 years later, in the 
mid-1990s, Brewer allegedly groomed a 16-year-old, first giving her 
‘platonic’ hugs in his office before moving on to kisses.

Court hearing: The charges relate to the alleged abuse and rape of a teenage girl

Eventually he began helping to take 
off her top and suggesting she perform a sex act on him, the court 
heard. But one evening principal Peter Hullah knocked on Brewer’s door 
and heard ‘scuffling’.Brewer called out ‘Wait a minute’ and, when Mr 
Hullah was allowed in, the girl could be seen exiting by a second door. 
Following an inquiry that year, 1994, Brewer resigned.

The trial was told the original 
alleged victim later told several people of her affair with Brewer but 
never directly complained to police. However three decades on she told a
 doctor who did inform detectives, resulting in the now divorced 
couple’s arrest.

The court heard the former pupil had been a hugely gifted musician.

But she was also a disruptive, 
badly-behaved teenager who used alcohol from a young age and had been 
sexually abused by a relative.

Brewer groomed her and the later pupil
 through flattery, Mr Cadwallader said, ‘commenting on their figure, 
their dress’ and also ‘their musical talent’.

He would encourage the first girl to 
take part in sex acts in his office, telling her to use a side door 
rather than the main entrance so his secretary didn’t become suspicious,
 the jury was told.

Her bad behaviour eventually led to her being suspended, and she was sent to live with the Brewers.

By the time she was 15 he was treating
 her as his girlfriend, taking her to pubs and allegedly indecently 
assaulting her beside a canal.

She went to study music abroad when 
she was 16, but on her return to Britain went to visit the Brewers where
 the alleged rape took place.

At the time, she didn’t regard what happened as abuse and saw it as ‘a small price to pay for the affection’ he showed her.

‘The prosecution case is very much 
that he abused that position using his power, influence and personality 
to seduce her,’ Mr Cadwallader added.

The alleged victim began her evidence yesterday by describing how her home life was ‘hell’.

She said she thought Brewer was ‘the bee’s knees’, ‘a special teacher’ who needed to be ‘worshipped’ by his pupils.

Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault.

His ex-wife, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape.

The trial continues.
