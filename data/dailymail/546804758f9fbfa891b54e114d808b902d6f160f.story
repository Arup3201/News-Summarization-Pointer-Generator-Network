He knows if you've been bad or good.

So organizers of the annual bar crawl SantaCon  asked participants to be good for goodness sake this year.

The festive gathering once again saw hundreds of people dressed as Santa Claus parade through New York City Saturday despite a police call for the event to be shut down, following repeated incidents of drunken brawls, public urination, and vomiting on the sidewalk in previous years.

Party time: Times Square was a sea of red and white as hundreds gathered for the notoriously drunken affair

Keeping warm: Santa Con party people keep each other warm against the freezing December chills

Taxi!: After a long day, revelers attempt to get home. Where's the sleigh?

Heading home: It's heard getting a taxi on Santa Con when you're dressed as, well, Santa

Taking a break: More more than 30 Manhattan bars  opened their doors to the annual bar crawl this year

Santa Con: Organizers agreed to start early and restrict themselves to bars in Midtown Manhattan

Insisting it is their First Amendment right to parade, SantaCon's leaders refused to back down - and started yesterday's march with a press conference to explain the legalities of it.

And with thousands of New Yorkers simultaneously demonstrating against police killings, the organizers pledged to remain respectful and celebrate indoors - mostly in Midtown - leaving the streets to protesters.

They gathered participants and NYPD officers in Times Square this morning to hear from their pro-bono attorney, Norman Siegel - who notably represented 'Ebola nurse' Kaci Hickox during her dispute with New Jersey authorities. 

'People should understand that whether they agree or disagree with [SantaCon's] message, which is the over-commercialization of Christmas, it doesn't matter,' Siegel declared, according to Gothamist. 

'It doesn't matter what the content of their message is. The First Amendment means that the government cannot prohibit [SantaCon's] expression. They can reasonably regulate their expression, but they can't prohibit it, that would be censorship.'

Siegel noted that the participants should be respectful of the demonstrations being held throughout New York City today against police killings.

They're instructing participants to stick to bars that welcome them and party inside instead of on the streets.

Pledge: Leaders, flanked by their attorney Norman Siegel, told police and reporters they will be respectful

All fun and games: Participants chatted amicably with cops as they got ready to hit Hell's Kitchen bars 

Route: The parade will see bar crawlers celebrate across a chain of Hell's Kitchen and midtown pubs

Siegel said he will be requesting a permit for next year's march, adding: 'This is America, you can't ban people from walking on public streets and being in public spaces. 

'That's not what America is all about. The government can't be calling bars and telling the bars that they can't allow SantaCon to come in. That's a no-no. 

'And if in fact that has been happening, we've been telling the government agencies they should cease and desist that kind of activity.' 

Aficionados say SantaCon is lighthearted communal fun that tweaks the nose of Christmastime consumerism. Participants are urged to bring gifts to hand out or prepare performances, and organizers stress that last year's event raised about $60,000 for charities.

'It was truly a spectacle of epic proportions' when Liz McManus went for the first time in 2010 at age 22, enjoying a day of singing, laughter and making new acquaintances. 

She went twice more but has been put off by reports of misbehavior since.

Some residents see SantaCon as an onslaught of crass Kringles, soused elves and anything-but-grandmotherly Mrs Clauses. 

There have been two arrests and 85 summonses for disorderly conduct, open alcohol containers and other offenses during the last two SantaCons, and an online video captured people in Santa suits fighting on the evening of last year's SantaCon.

Excitement: The crowds insisted it is their First Amendment right to parade and raise money for charity 

'Bit of fun': Aficionados insist the event is a tongue-in-cheek nod to Christmas consumerism

Festivities: These girls took a snap of their outfits before parading with the hundreds through New York

Tour de force: Despite the dispute, the crowd was buzzing. Another march held today will protest cop killings

'Pro: The event raises money for kids that need therapy,' host Jimmy Fallon said on NBC's 'The Tonight Show' this week. 'Con: Specifically, the ones that need therapy after seeing Santa take a leak behind a dumpster.'

Bar owners are split, with some welcoming the daytime business and others saying SantaCon is too rowdy.

Anti-Con sentiment started peaking last year, as residents of Manhattan's bar-filled Lower East Side posted 'SantaCon free zone' signs, local commuter railroads began banning alcoholic drinks on their trains during the gathering, and a police lieutenant suggested to midtown Manhattan bars that the event hurt the neighborhood, though the then-police commissioner expressed support for it.

With prodding from city and state officeholders, organizers let police and community leaders know their planned route and tasked volunteers with helping keep participants in line.

Can hold them down: City officials conceded that the sheer scale of the crawl makes it hard to ban

'Santa Loves NYC': One said: 'NYC Santa realizes that he has a responsibility to New York City and its citizens'

But 'all those efforts really don't make up for the fact that this is a group of people who largely come to drink,' state Senator Brad Hoylman said Friday. 'It amounts to an epic pub crawl that is very difficult to control.'

Thoughts of bringing the event to Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood this year were scuttled as a city councilman urged bars not to participate and the Parks Department said no to using a local park as a meet-up point.

And Hoylman, state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried and City Councilman Corey Johnson sent organizers a letter Friday urging them not to return to Hell's Kitchen in future.

But for now, SantaCon is coming to town with a nice-not-naughty message.

'NYC Santa realizes that he has a responsibility to New York City and its citizens,' the organizers say on their website. 

'Santa Loves NYC.'
