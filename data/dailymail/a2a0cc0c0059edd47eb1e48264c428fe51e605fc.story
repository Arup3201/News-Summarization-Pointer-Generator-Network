Police in North Carolina confirmed at a press conference on Monday that murdered school counselor Maggie Daniels was strangled inside her own apartment in June.

The new details were released on the same day that suspect Sharman Odom made his first appearance in court for his arraignment in a Newton court and was pictured smirking again as he was reminded of the charges his faces.

Odom, 34, is starring at the death penalty for the murder of Daniels, 31 and when his mother Darlene Odom left court on Monday morning she was videoed flailing her arms at photographers and Newton police confirmed she will face three assault charges as a result of her actions.

Investigators said that Maggie Daniels was asphyxiated inside her apartment on June 28 after a struggle.

'She died of strangulation,' said Newton Police Chief Donald Brown according to WBTV. 'There was a struggle.'

Newton police said that upon obtaining a search warrant last week, they discovered physical evidence, including a patch of missing hair near Odom's scalp that led to them charging the man on Saturday.

The hair was later found by authorities in Odom's closet, according to the warrant.

During the search of Odom's house on July 26 police also recovered cell phones that revealed selfies of the suspect with scratches on his face.

Investigators did say that tests have not been able to determine whether Daniels had been physically assaulted and still authorities have yet to find any evidence of a link between Odom and the Newton High School counselor.

Odom's current attorney told NBC Charlotte's Rad Berky that he is 'fearful' and is 'concerned about some things' - although he could not explain why his client smiled again during his court appearance.

Odom, 34, is the only suspect in the murder of 31-year-old Maggie Daniels, who was found dead June 28 in her Newton, North Carolina apartment, officials said.

Odom was Daniels’ neighbor in the apartment complex, cops told WSOC, and he has a violent past that includes accusations of rape and assault.

Daniels’ lifeless body was discovered on her bedroom floor by a neighbor who went inside after finding the door to the woman’s apartment open, according to WSOC.

There was no sign of forced entry.

On Saturday, Odom grinned as police led him away in handcuffs after he was arrested.

‘Why do you have a grin on your face,’ a reporter reporter could be heard asking Odom on the video.

The accused killer did not reply.

Daniels was also previously warned by a friend to take self-defense classes ‘and to give serious consideration to other measures to protect’ herself, WSOC reported.

‘It’s absolutely shocking,’ a neighbor told the station.‘I talked to him a little bit,’ Ryan Cline, whose mother lived next door to Odom, told the station. ‘He was really quiet and observant.’

Court documents revealed Odom was previously arrested on charges of second-degree rape and assault by strangulation.

Those charges were subsequently dropped.

‘She seemed really friendly,’ said another neighbor. ‘She was always smiling.’
