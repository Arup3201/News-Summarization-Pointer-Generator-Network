A gang of rogue traders fleeced elderly people out of more than £1million by overcharging them for shoddy building work.

Among their victims was widow Grace Gibbs, 87, who had bladder cancer and lost at least £123,000 as a result of unnecessary and often-duplicated work on her home in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.

Investigators managed to record a conversation between gang members - who picked vulnerable targets and checked bank statements to assess their assets - in which they celebrated her death.

Accused: Van Purdy, 60, (left) and Anthony Symes, 59, (right) outside Chelmsford Crown Court today. They are two of the six men who traded as East Coast Builders, Complete Building Services and AJ Builders

Arrested: Investigators managed to record a conversation between gang members - who picked vulnerable targets and checked bank statements to assess their assets - in which they celebrated one victim's death

Taken away: Police and trading standards officers found 18 victims but say up to 120 more were never identified

Police and trading standards officers found 18 victims but say up to 120 more were never identified.

The gang went back time and time again over four years, demanded more cash and ‘mined’ their accounts, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

Led by ringleader James Brown Snr, they pressurised them into handing over life savings and discouraged them from talking to concerned relatives and neighbours.

Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said: ‘James Brown Snr, William Brown, James Brown Jnr and Anthony Symes appeared to be celebrating the death of Mrs Gibbs.

‘She was the person they were 
concerned had sufficient evidence to convict them. Anthony Symes 
referred to a previous acquittal due to the unavailability of an elderly
 witness.

‘The reality was she had given them so much money she couldn’t meet her standing orders for basic needs.’

Victim: Andrew Millar, 86, registered blind, fears the gang conned him out of £300,000 for building work, dodgy investments and loans  to pay for James Brown Snr's mortgage

Investigation: The gang went back time and time again over four years, demanded more cash and 'mined' their victims' accounts, a court heard

Probe: The gang members were arrested after an investigation between Essex Police and Essex Trading Standards in July last year

Nasty work: The gang pressurised victims into handing over life savings and discouraged them from talking to concerned relatives and neighbours

Some
 of the victims and their families listened to the evidence in the court
 room yesterday. One left sobbing as a transcript of the conversation 
was read out.

A convicted killer is among the defendants.

Peter Biddle was jailed for killing his wife in 1988.

He was also subject to a suspended sentence for rogue trading at Maidstone Crown Court three years ago.

James Brown has 19 offences on his record, including 16 for fraud, and was also subjected to a suspended sentence for rogue trading.

William Brown has 38 offences on record and Van Purdy has 25.

James Brown Jnr and Anthony Symes were of previous good character.

Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said: ‘These defendants operated as builders who cold-called vulnerable elderly people and persuaded them to part with substantial sums of money for unnecessary building works or, where the work was justified, demanded extortionate sums of money.

‘Often the work was of poor quality. These cannot be the only victims of this gang and a conservative estimate is that they obtained at least £1 million.’

The gang members were arrested after an investigation between Essex Police and Essex Trading Standards in July last year.

Six men, who traded as East Coast Builders, Complete Building Services and AJ Builders, have admitted various charges linked to the fraud and appeared in court yesterday.

They are William Brown, 49, of Colchester; James Brown Jnr, 21, of Tiptree; Peter Biddle, 66, of Ardleigh; Van Purdy, 60, also of Ardleigh; James Brown Snr, 45, of Colchester; and Anthony Symes, 59, of Weeley Heath.

Judge John Dodds said: ‘It seems that once they got their claws into their victims, they would not let go.’  He will continue to hear the evidence and mitigation today before sentencing the gang tomorrow.

Helen Reeve Smith, who suffered from dementia and died last year aged 93, was invoiced for work totalling £30,000 and handed over £10,000. James Brown Jnr, who one victim called ‘Smarmy Jim’, and fellow gang member William Brown were caught on CCTV in a bank with Mrs Reeve Smith as she withdrew money days before being sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Christopher Ramsay, 58, who lived alone and was described as vulnerable, was initially quoted £650 for some bathroom tiling, which was carried out to a poor standard. He eventually handed over about £15,000, much of which was withdrawn after James Brown Snr drove him to cash points.

Kenneth Petford was ‘groomed’ into handing over £81,000 - his entire life savings - after one gang member offered to powerwash his patio before convincing him further work was needed.

Andrew Millar, 86, registered blind, fears the gang conned him out of £300,000 for building work, dodgy investments and loans to pay for James Brown Snr’s mortgage. James Brown Snr, who had known Mr Millar for 25 years, paid for a coy carp pond on one occasion, but ended up with a hole in the ground. Prosecutor Andrew Shaw said: ‘Just a few days before the police interview he thought James Brown Snr was the victim of a witch hunt by trading standards.’ The court heard transfers had been made from Mr Millar to the company New Horizons, which James Brown Snr was the registered owner, referenced ‘Dad’ or ‘love Dad’ but Mr Millar said he cannot know what he was signing.
