At full stretch, the tip of Kevin Anderson's racket looms 10ft high as he smashes a serve at his opponent

At full stretch, the tip of Kevin Anderson’s racket looms 10ft high as he smashes a serve at his opponent.

Unfortunately for Andy Murray, he will be the man standing on the other side of the net as the ball hurtles towards him at up to 137mph today at Wimbledon.

The Scot faces the 6ft8in South African on Centre Court as they battle it out for a place in the quarter finals.

Anderson has already served 63 aces in this year’s competition and beat Murray heavily in the most recent of their two encounters.

But if it’s any consolation for Murray, who is a considerable 6ft3in, his opponent’s mother insists he is a ‘gentle giant’.

In his spare time the softly-spoken university graduate enjoys reading and learning to play the guitar.

He is married to his college sweetheart, Kelsey, who has been supporting him at Wimbledon.

And Anderson, 28, has already admitted to suffering from nerves in this year’s tournament – although not on the court.

Instead they came as he returned to the changing rooms after his third round victory and he bumped into comedian Ricky Gervais, who was at Wimbledon to watch Murray.

Anderson said afterwards: ‘I’m one of his biggest fans.

'My hand started sweating.

'It’s just funny, when you’re not used to something it’s amazing what you get nervous about.’

Yesterday it was Murray’s turn to be starstruck after he trained with Gervais, star of sitcom The Office, who is the Scot’s favourite comedian too.

Murray said: ‘When I went over to Spain when I was 15, I watched an episode of The Office almost every single night I was there. I could basically remember it word for word when I was over there training.’

Murray previously played world number 18 Anderson twice, winning easily at the 2010 Australian Open before losing heavily in the Montreal Masters the following year.

The pair have also practised together in Miami where the Scot trains.

Anderson said: ‘It will be a great experience for me.

'It’s why I play this game, to play greats, and at such a big tournament. 

'I don’t need to go on too much about how he is as a tennis player. He’s one of the best.’

For his part, Murray, 27, said he is relishing the clash and doesn’t plan to change his tactics for the match.

He said: ‘The only thing that’s different is my return, because he’s obviously serving different angles at different heights, so the ball’s bouncing up much higher.

'I enjoy pressure. I like feeling nervous. I’m not scared of that feeling. I felt like I played my best tennis when I’ve been under pressure.’

But Murray arguably has the upper hand going into the match.

He has spent just five hours on court over three matches during the first week of Wimbledon, while Anderson has played for seven hours.

He is never anything but tough on court.

But yesterday Andy Murray showed his playful side as he posed for a selfie with his two young cousins. 

The defending champion chatted and laughed with 11-year-old twins Cora and Ailsa Erskine at the All England Club during ‘Middle Sunday’ – the tournament’s only day of no play.

The Scot, 27, grinned cheerily as he larked about with the children of his mother Judy’s brother Niall Erskine, at one point affectionately hugging the two girls.

Roy Erskine, Murray’s grandfather, said the twins would be in London to watch Murray’s progress all week, adding: ‘They are very fond of their cousin.’
