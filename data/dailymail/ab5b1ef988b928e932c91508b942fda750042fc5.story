If the catfights off the set of Real Housewives of Atlanta are any indication of things to come when the new season begins, get ready for the fur to fly when the hit Bravo show returns to the air next month. Newcomer Claudia Jordan and pack leader NeNe Leakes are clawing at each other already.

Favorite Georgia Peaches. Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Kenya Moore, Phaedra Parks and NeNe all return along with Claudia, who will be on board as a new full-time Housewife. 

After two and a half seasons, Porsha Williams will no longer be a full-time cast member on the series.but will have a recurring role as a 'friend' of the Housewives alongside newcomer actress-singer Demetria McKinney.

Catfight!  NeNe Leakes and Claudia Jordan went at it on the recent cast trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico

 MailOnline revealed in August that McKinney, 32, former star of Tyler Perry's House of Payne,  joined the cast along with Celebrity Apprentice star Jordan, 41.

Both McKinney and Jordan was originally slated to be secondary cast members on the show - Bravo calls them 'B Characters.' However, an on-camera feud with the 46-year-old NeNe apparently changed that and thrust Jordan to main character position.

A source close to the show tells MailOnline that the drama has already been intense.

During a trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico, all the cast members were having dinner when Jordan and Leakes began to argue. 

'Claudia kept trying to start an argument with NeNe to get attention,' a show insider told MailOnline.

'After a few subtle digs, NeNe let into her; claiming that Claudia has a reputation for sleeping with lots of men in Hollywood  and wearing "cheap" clothes.

'Nene called Claudia  a "pretender" who was desperately trying to get a job on the show and living living in Kenya's shadow,' revealed the source.

Jordan did not taking her verbal assault from Leakes lying down and quickly lashed back.

'Claudia told NeNe that she was just a few years from being off the stripper pole for good and that if she kept spending all her money on plastic surgery, she would have to brush up on her pole dancing routine. 

'She also told NeNe that maybe she should've brought back some of her old stripper moves while doing Dancing with the Stars. Then maybe she would have won,' the source continued.

NeNe was eliminated from the show last April, in the seventh week of the season.

Jordan and Leakes have since become bitter enemies, initially to the delight of former Miss USA winner Kenya Moore, who brought Jordan aboard the reality series as her friend.

'Initially it was seemed as though Kenya loved having an ally to help her combat NeNe. 

'But the more producers got excited about Claudia stepping up and willingly going up against NeNe, it started to cause some tension between the two friends,' the show insider explained.

Those on set believe that Moore is becoming jealous of how Jordan has upstaged her on the show. She was trying to help her friend get a job and now Claudia has advanced by leaps and bounds from a part time cast member to a full time one.

'Kenya has made it clear that Claudia is her friend and she is responsible for getting her on the show. She griped to the executive producer that they were spending a lot of time focusing on Claudia and she didn't appreciate that,' the source revealed.

Show insiders believe it's only a matter of time before Moore and Jordan are at odds too, but meanwhile the former 'Deal or No Deal' and 'The Price is Right' model continues to keep Leakes on her toes.
