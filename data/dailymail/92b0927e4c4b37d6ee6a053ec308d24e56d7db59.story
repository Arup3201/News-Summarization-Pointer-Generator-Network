It is almost 7am on a Sunday morning and most people are at home in bed.

But this shocking video shows how the streets of one of Britain’s cities are still filled with brawling drunks from the night before.

The CCTV footage from Norwich in Norfolk showing revellers on nights out punching and kicking each other has been released by police to highlight the problems caused by early-morning drinking.

Mass brawl: Norfolk Constabulary has released CCTV footage of early morning violence in Norwich

Scrap: Police say the introduction of extended licensing hours has resulted in a spike in alcohol-related crime

The video shows innocent bystanders making their way home caught up in the violence as groups of thugs attack each other.

Norfolk Police said that there has been a 210 per cent increase in violent crime in the city between 3am and 6am since licensing hours were extended in 2005 allowing pubs and clubs to open longer.

The force said that the surge in violence has led to an increase in police hours of 12,000 per year.

It is now calling on the local council to ban the sale of alcohol during the early morning and showed the video to councillors to reinforce how bad the situation has become.

Upsetting: A councillor on Norwich City Council called the footage 'quite horrific'

The council is considering banning alcohol sales between 3am and 6am on weekdays and from 3.45am to 6am at the weekend in some areas

Norfolk Police said that there has been a 210 per cent increase in violent crime between 3am and 6am

The council is considering introducing early morning restriction orders (EMROs) in three city centre areas, which would ban alcohol sales from 3am to 6am on weekdays and from 3.45am to 6am at the weekend.

Detective Superintendent Paul Sandford of Norfolk Police said early-morning drinking was causing ‘significant problems’.

He said: ‘Pubs and clubs used to close so much earlier than they do now. Their later hours of operating have undoubtedly seen an increase in crime and disorder reported to us.

‘The point I want to make is that in these very small hours at the end of the night is when we’re seeing an increase in crime and it's only in these small hours that we want to restrict the sale of alcohol.’

Paul Kendrick, one of the councillors on Norwich City Council who viewed the footage, said: ‘It was quite horrific.

‘There were some very unpleasant scenes of violence.

‘I knew this was a serious problem, but there’s nothing like seeing it to actually realise the gravity of it.’

Mike Stonard, councillor with responsibility for licensing, added: ‘The overwhelming majority of visitors to Norwich’s night-time economy will continue to have fun and enjoy themselves.

‘But these restrictions will enable the police to deal with problem behaviour much more effectively and efficiently.'
