Alcohol prices costs in the UK are higher than most of Europe, new figures revealed today.

Families feeling the pinch will also be alarmed by research showing Brits pay on average more for milk, cheese and eggs than the European Union average.

And smokers face some of the highest prices in the whole of EU as taxes rise in an attempt to persuade cash-strapped addicts to quit.

Cost of living: Milk, eggs, cheese, alcohol and tobacco are all more expensive than the European Average according to a new league table published by the Office for National Statistics

The 2012 league table of food and 
drink costs reveals Norway is the most expensive place to shop, followed
 by Switzerland and Denmark, the Office for National Statistics said.

Across all food and non-alcoholic drinks, the UK pays four per cent above the EU27.

Norway has the highest prices at 86 per cent above the average while Macedonia is the lowest  on 42 per cent below.

But
 alcohol prices in the UK are some of the highest in Europe, some 43 per
 cent above the EU27 average, behind only high-cost Scandinavian 
countries like Norway, Finland and Sweden., and places like Iceland and 
Ireland.

Booze: Alcohol prices in the UK were among some of the most expensive in Europe, behind only Scandinavian countries, Iceland and Ireland

Tax: Tobacco costs in the UK are the third highest in Europe, behind only Norway and Ireland, according to the Office for National Statistics

Critics accused the government of driving up costs by increasing duty on beer, wine and spirits.

Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said: ‘Huge tax rises are mostly to blame.

‘This is why the successful campaign to abolish the beer duty escalator was so vital. Up until the March Budget, we saw beer duty rise by 42 per cent over four years.

‘Huge amounts of red tape, and other taxes such as business rates, also push up prices.  The industry supports almost one million jobs – and we could be creating many more if tax and red tape weren’t so stifling.’

By comparison, in France alcohol costs are 12 per cent below the average and Germany 18 per cent lower.

Food: Overall shopping bills in the UK were 4 per cent above the average, while Norway was the most expensive place in Europe

Dough: The one sign of good news for British shoppers was that bread and cereals were 11 per cent cheaper than the EU average

The cheapest places to buy booze are Macedonia and Bulgaria, where prices are more than a third lower than Europe's average.

The new figures show tobacco prices in the UK were 94 per cent above the average last year.

Only Norway (170 per cent higher) and Ireland (99 per cent above) were more expensive.

The form part of the Eurostat price survey on food, beverages and tobacco.

British shoppers also pay more for milk, cheese and egg prices with prices 7 per cent higher than the rest of Europe.

Once again, Norway is the most expensive at 114 per cent above while Poland is the cheapest at 37 per cent below the average.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'Our research shows that rising food prices is one of the top worries for financially squeezed consumers, with one in five households already saying they're having to dip into their savings to pay for basics, such as food.'

According to latest Which? research, 9.8 million households are feeling the squeeze with 78 per cent of people now worried about food prices.

Four in ten people are likely to reduce their spending on groceries and food in the next few months.

According to the ONS study, the cost of meat in the UK was exactly in line with the average with Switzerland the most expensive and Albania least expensive.

The one glimmer of good news for Brits came on the cost of bread and cereals, which was 11 per cent below the EU average.
