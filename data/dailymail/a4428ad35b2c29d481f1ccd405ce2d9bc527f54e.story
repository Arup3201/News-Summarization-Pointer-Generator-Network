Books can transport readers with a good imagination to faraway lands simply through the power of language.

But it seems some novels can transport their fans in reality, too. A survey found we are often persuaded to visit places across the world because they are the settings of our favourite novels.

Breakfast at Tiffany’s by Truman Capote topped the list, inspiring readers to take a trip to New York. The book, published in 1958, features Manhattan society girl Holly Golightly, who was played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 movie.

In a poll, 37 per cent – all women – said the author had convinced them to visit the Big Apple.

The survey by High Street discount store The Works found the second most popular book destination – and the top choice for men – was JRR Tolkien’s Lord Of The Rings.

Some 15 per cent had travelled to New Zealand, where the movie was shot. Third in the list was Alex Garland’s The Beach, set in Thailand, followed by JK Rowling’s Harry Potter, which was partly filmed at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland.

Other choices included Victor Hugo’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame in Paris and Louis de Bernieres’s Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, a vivid portrayal of the Greek island Kefalonia.

Kevin Keaney, chief executive of The Works, said: ‘It’s great to see that people are still reading and getting carried away to another world, both metaphorically and literally, it would appear, by fantastic and inspiring novels.

‘We love the fact reading is accessible enough for everyone to get involved in it as an activity and, if it inspires Brits to be more adventurous with their holiday choices, that’s no bad thing either.’

Holiday-maker Joanna Benson, 32, of Harrow, north west London, said: ‘I love Breakfast at Tiffany’s - both the book and the movie - and I went to New York when I was 20 to see the place for myself.

‘Books often inspire me to go off on a trip and I’ve been Kefalonia twice since reading Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.’
