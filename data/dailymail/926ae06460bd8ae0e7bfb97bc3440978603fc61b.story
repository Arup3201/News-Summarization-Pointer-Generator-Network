Leeds United are in talks with Palermo over loan deals for defender Sol Bamba and midfielder Granddi N'Goyi.

The Championship club are struggling near the relegation zone and manager Neil Redfearn is desperate to strengthen his squad. 

Reports from Italy claim that Leeds chairman Massimo Cellino has sounded out Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini about a loan deal for the pair.

Ivory Coast defender Bamba joined Palermo on a free transfer in the summer after two years in Turkey with Trabzonspor. He has previous Championship experience with Leicester City.

Meanwhile, N'Goyi has emerged as a target after struggling to break into the Palermo team. The 26-year-old has failed to make a single start for Palermo all season, coming off the bench just five times.

The former French Under-21 international is a combative midfielder who could add some steel to Leeds' midfield. 

Leeds are also interested in Palermo defender who has Championship experience with Leicester
