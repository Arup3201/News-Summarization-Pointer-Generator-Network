The BBC has apologised over a controversial joke which suggested Prince Harry takes cocaine - but only for getting the name of a friend of the Royals wrong in the gag.

Comedian Jo Brand said on Have I Got News for You: 'George's godparents include Hugh van Cutsem - I presume that’s a nickname as in Hugh van cuts 'em and Harry then snorts 'em.'

In fact, Prince George's godfather is William van Cutsem, whose brother and late father are both called Hugh, and the BBC has now apologised to Clarence House for the error.

Controversy: Jo Brand, left, made a joke on Have I Got News for You which implied that Prince Harry took drugs

However, the corporation has stood by the satirical suggestion that Harry takes drugs, saying that it was 'clearly tongue-in-cheek'.

The joke was made on last Friday's edition of the comedy news quiz by Ms Brand, a member of the anti-monarchist organisation Republic.

Panellists were discussing the christening of Prince George when she made the quip, which was written by producers and appeared on the host's autocue.

There is no evidence that Prince Harry, a serving Army officer, has ever taken Class A drugs, although he is said to have smoked cannabis as a teenager.

Error: Ms Brand also referred to Prince George's godfather William van Cutsem, pictured with his wife Rosie, as 'Hugh', the name of hsi brother and late father

The error about Mr van Cutsem's name added to the outrage expressed by many viewers.

It was considered particularly insensitive as the elder Hugh van Cutsem, a close friend of Prince Charles, died just two months ago.

The BBC wrote to Kensington Palace apologising for the mistake after Royal aides apparently contacted the corporation to complain.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We apologise for the factual inaccuracy in last Friday's programme and have edited iPlayer and future repeats accordingly.'

Shock: Fellow panellist Ian Hislop asked, 'Have we lost the lawyers?' after Ms Brand's joke

But the corporation has refused to budge from its previous argument that the drug reference was nothing more than a joke which should not be considered offensive.

'Have I Got News For You is a satirical news quiz and the audience is used to the often irreverent humour,' a spokesman said this week. 'This was clearly a tongue-in-cheek comment.'

Ms Brand, 56, also said she would not apologise, pointing out that she did not write the joke but adding: 'I thought it was funny. I don’t really understand what the fuss is about.'

After she made the crack, fellow panellist Paul Merton looked shocked, while Ian Hislop said: 'Have we lost the lawyers?'

Lord Dannatt, former head of the Army, later said that the suggestion was 'outrageous' and 'most inappropriate'.

Defence minister Anna Soubry added: 'That is disgraceful, shoddy, appalling and out of order. Prince Harry does an outstanding job in the Army and always goes the extra mile to help wounded service personnel and veterans.'
