Ringleader: Mohammed Zulficar, 33, was jailed for 24 years for his leading role in a plot to distribute crack, cocaine and heroin from a Sheffield flat

A gang of five men were jailed today for their parts in a plot to cut and distribute heroin, cocaine and crack worth a stunning £125million in Yorkshire.

Ringleader Mohammed Zulficar, 33, a previously convicted heroin dealer, was sentenced to 24 years after a court heard he had begun the operation while still in prison.

His associates Adnan Lal, 27, Mohammed Ishaq, 39, Mohammed Faizan, 26, and Haidar Ali, 25, were jailed for 18 years, 16 years, 12 years and 12 years respectively.

Such was the fear they inspired, key witnesses would only testify in the trial after emigrating away from the UK.

Sheffield Crown Court heard that the men set up their operation in a rented flat in a leafy suburb of that city, where they cut heroin and cocaine and produced crack cocaine on an industrial scale.

When officers raided the property, they found 'leftover' kilos of cocaine and heroin with an estimated street value of about £300,000, as well as cutting agents and equipment to support a drugs preparation factory.

Investigations revealed the men had begun working in April 2010 and, over five months, would have produced class A drugs with a street value of a staggering £125million.

As he handed down the punitive sentences, with police officers flanking the courtroom for security, Judge Peter Kelson QC called the plot a 'professional operation' that produced drugs on a 'massive scale'.

'This was class A drugs supply on a massive scale and bigger than most cases I have seen come through South Yorkshire,' the judge said.

Judge Kelson told the court that ringleader Zulficar started running the operation while serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence for dealing heroin.

Zulficar had intentionally chosen people he knew and trusted - but most importantly, did not have criminal records - to be foot soldiers and workers in the operation.

The flat was rented by Faizan, who later told police it had been his 'chill pad' - despite there being no evidence of entertainment or essentials in the property.

Neighbours told police that within weeks of him moving in they began hearing ‘strange, industrial-type’ noises, and regularly saw several Asian men coming and going.

When police raided the property in September 2010, Zulficar was there, and shortly afterwards Lal arrived. Further investigations led police to two more members of the group - Ishaq and Ali.

A ‘long and complex’ two-year police investigation followed, and the five men were arrested in April 2012. All were charged with conspiracy to produce and supply Class A drugs.

The court even heard that the next door neighbours - who acted as key witnesses in the trial - only felt safe to give evidence once they had emigrated.

DC Andrew Shaw, the officer who led the investigation, said: 'This was a sophisticated operation which we were able to stop, thanks to the information from an observant and concerned local resident.

'This is a prime example of the community and the police working together in difficult times. Drugs are a blight on decent communities that can have disastrous effects on lives.

'I would always encourage members of the public to tell us what’s happening in their communities and we will take action wherever possible.'
