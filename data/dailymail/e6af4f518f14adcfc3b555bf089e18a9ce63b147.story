Hayley was 'too young' for bowel cancer to be considered

Hayley
 Hovey was 23 weeks' pregnant with her first baby when she suddenly woke
 in the middle of the night with a sharp, shooting pain in her side.

She
 visited her GP's out-of-hours service but was reassured to hear her 
baby's heartbeat and be told all was well. The pain was probably 
'ligament strain' caused by the weight of the growing baby. 'I was 
ecstatic to be having a baby - I've always wanted to be a mum,' says 
Hayley, 34. 'All my scans showed my baby was healthy, so I didn't think 
anything more about that pain.'

She now knows it was the first sign 
there was a grave threat to her baby's life, and her own. Four weeks 
later her daughter, Autumn, was born prematurely and later died. Then 
Hayley was found to have bowel cancer.

Doctors now think Autumn's 
death was linked to her mother's cancer, with a blood clot breaking away
 from the tumour, damaging Hayley's placenta and cutting off the food 
supply to her unborn baby.

However, it took four months after 
Autumn's death for Hayley to be diagnosed. The problem was her age - she
 was 'too young' for bowel cancer to be considered.

Hayley, who lives
 in Fareham, Hants, with her husband Paul, a 35-year-old IT consultant, 
says: 'Looking back, I had textbook symptoms - exhaustion, intermittent 
stomach pains, increasingly bad diarrhoea, blood in my stools and 
bleeding.

The disease is Britain's second-biggest cancer killer, 
claiming 16,000 lives a year. The number of under-50s diagnosed has been
 gradually rising - to around 2,100 a year.

But a recent survey by 
the charity Bowel Cancer UK of patients under 50 found that 42 per cent 
of the women had visited their GP at least five times before being 
referred for tests.

Indeed, Hayley, a supply planner for an IT firm,
 was examined five times by different doctors and midwives, who all 
missed her symptoms, despite a golf ball-sized lump appearing on her 
stomach after her pregnancy. By the time she was diagnosed, Hayley had 
stage three to four cancer, meaning the tumour had broken through her 
bowel wall.

She had to undergo a seven-hour operation to remove the 6cm growth, followed by six months of chemo and radiotherapy.

But
 her experience is not uncommon, says Deborah Alsina, chief executive of
 Bowel Cancer UK: 'We hear from many younger people who express 
frustration at not getting a diagnosis and support.'

‘Bowel cancer is often associated with older patients over 50 - but younger people can, and do, regularly get it, as the tragic story of Stephen Sutton recently highlighted,' adds Kevin Monahan,  consultant gastroenterologist at West Middlesex University Hospital, London.

Stephen Sutton, 
the 19-year-old fundraiser who died last week from the disease, told the
 Mail earlier this month of his anger that he was not diagnosed for six 
months after his symptoms started. This was despite his family history 
of Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition that raises the risk of bowel 
cancer.

'If it had been caught earlier, it could have led to a 
better prognosis,' he said. Hayley, too, eventually discovered she had 
Lynch syndrome.

Bowel cancer is very treatable if detected early - 93
 per cent of patients who are found to have a small tumour on the bowel 
wall  live for five years or more. Yet only 9 per cent of cases are 
diagnosed at this stage - most are diagnosed at stage three. So, the 
overall five-year survival rate for bowel-cancer patients is just 54 per
 cent.

Because patients and many doctors assume that young people 
won't get bowel cancer, they are particularly likely to have 
advanced-stage tumours at the time of diagnosis.

Cancer charities are
 campaigning to improve diagnosis for all ages - they want new 
diagnostic guidelines for GPs and earlier screening procedures.

Sean 
Duffy, NHS England's national clinical director for cancer, says: 'The 
UK lags behind much of Europe in terms of survival from bowel cancer. We
 need to change this, and this includes identifying it better in 
patients under 50.'

National GP guidelines state only patients aged 
60 and over should be automatically referred to hospital for tests if 
they have one symptom. Patients aged 40 to 60 must exhibit two or more 
symptoms.

For under 40s, there is often an assumption the symptoms 
must be something else, says Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the 
charity Beating Bowel Cancer. 'We've had patients with red-flag symptoms
 - such as blood in their stools - being told "you've got IBS" or 
"you're too young to have cancer" by their GPs.'

Four weeks after 
Hayley's initial scare, she was unable to feel her baby moving. Tests 
revealed Autumn had stopped growing, and she had to be delivered by 
emergency caesarean. After her birth, in July 2011, she was taken to a 
specialist neo-natal unit at Southampton General Hospital but died in 
hospital a few weeks later.

Two weeks afterwards, Hayley experienced
 more shooting pains. With her pregnancy bump gone, there was also a 
noticeable lump on the side of her waist. Her midwife said it was 
probably an infection, and Hayley was given antibiotics.

But her 
health deteriorated rapidly and she had to take six weeks off work with 
exhaustion, which her GP put down to depression.

Within three months
 of Autumn's death, Hayley was suffering from nausea and abdominal pain.

Unable to get a GP's appointment, she went to A&E but was told the 
lump was possibly an infection related to her caesarean. Doctors 
performed a cervical smear test (which was subsequently lost) and sent 
her home with paracetamol.

'I got the impression they didn't take me very seriously,' she recalls.

Soon
 after, she was vomiting up to ten times a day, feeling dizzy and weak, 
passing blood and experiencing chronic diarrhoea. At an emergency GP 
appointment, she was examined by a different doctor who immediately 
referred her to hospital; after several days of tests, she was diagnosed
 with cancer.

Four days before Christmas, Hayley underwent surgery. 
'We thought we'd be enjoying our first Christmas as a family, but 
instead I was in hospital, grieving for the loss of our little girl and 
terrified about the future,' she recalls. 'My treatment might have been 
less of an ordeal if my cancer had been picked up sooner. It makes me 
quite angry to think if I'd been 60, it would have been picked up more 
quickly.'

But even obvious symptoms are often missed by doctors, 
says Mr Flannagan. 'I am not blaming GPs, but we need to not be shy of 
pointing out where things are going wrong. The default position should 
be for a GP to rule out cancer, just to be safe.'

'It can also be problematic if patients don’t have obvious symptoms such as bleeding', says Dr Monahan. ‘They may instead have vaguer symptoms such as tiredness, unexplained weight loss or abdominal pain, which could be attributed to being symptoms of other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s disease.'

Public awareness 
is also an issue. A survey in March by health insurer AXA PPP found 
nearly half of men couldn't name one symptom of bowel cancer.

Indeed,
 Martin Vickers, 49, had never heard of it before his diagnosis in 2008.
 'I was totally shocked,' says the father of four, who lives in 
Burton-on-Trent with wife Andrea, 48. 'I didn't know bowel cancer 
existed. It was hugely traumatic.'

Martin visited his GP five times 
in nine months with extreme tiredness and loose stools. His symptoms 
were attributed to stress - his mother had recently died and he has a 
high-pressure job as head of capital investment for Cambridge and South 
Staffordshire Water - and then IBS.

'But I knew something wasn't 
right,' says Martin. 'It was instinctive.' He was finally diagnosed with
 stage three bowel cancer in November 2008, after his GP did an internal
 examination and felt a lump.

Martin underwent three months of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by surgery, another six months 
of chemotherapy and a second operation. He now has to use a colostomy 
bag but has been in remission for five years.

Currently, screening is
 only available to people aged 60-plus. They are sent home tests, which 
involve sending a stool sample to a lab. But the Department of Health is
 now looking at a new procedure, bowel scope screening, which involves a
 partial colonoscopy -examining only the lower bowel.

A major UK 
trial of 55 to 64 year olds showed that people screened this way were 43
 per cent less likely to die from bowel cancer, and 33 per cent less 
likely to develop it.

This is because the procedure is usually successful at detecting small growths known as polyps, which can become cancerous.

The
 screening - which would be offered to everyone aged 55 and over - is 
now being piloted. Campaigners hope it will be made available nationally
 by 2016.

‘This is a really important development and should make a big difference to bowel cancer outcomes,’ says Dr Monahan, who runs the Family History of Bowel Cancer clinic at West Middlesex University Hospital, specialising in hereditary components of the disease.

It won't, however, help younger patients such as Hayley. 
Before her chemotherapy, she and Paul had nine embryos frozen via IVF. 
However she is worried she may pass on Lynch syndrome, so the couple are
 considering what to do.

But she says: 'I am still here, I have a life ahead of me - and I hope my story will help others to be diagnosed in time.'
