Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt are expected to be named as England’s centre pairing to face the All Blacks on Saturday as Stuart Lancaster tries yet another midfield combination.

Without Manu Tuilagi (groin) and Luther Burrell (hand), Lancaster is understood to favour Bath rugby league convert Eastmond and Saracens stalwart Barritt in a bid to repeat the shock victory his side pulled off over the world champions two years ago.

Eastmond, 25, has been the form No 12 in the Aviva Premiership this season while the trusted Barritt has impressed since returning from injury three weeks ago and is set to be named in the outside centre position.

‘Brad brings a huge amount defensively and physically and he is a very good reader of the defence and sets the defensive tone,’ said Lancaster this week.

‘He has improved his decision-making and his ability to get over the gain line. His performance against the Crusaders [on tour last summer] was his best in an England shirt for a while. He is a strong leader within the team. He wants to improve, he has great humility and he is definitely improving in all areas.’

Eastmond — who weighs just 80kg — was outstanding alongside Tuilagi in the first Test in the summer before being harshly dropped for the second and then struggling when recalled for the third. 

But his form has been so good for Bath at the start of this season it looks certain he will be picked ahead of Billy Twelvetrees and Jonathan Joseph — assuming he has recovered from the rib injury picked up on club duty a fortnight ago.
