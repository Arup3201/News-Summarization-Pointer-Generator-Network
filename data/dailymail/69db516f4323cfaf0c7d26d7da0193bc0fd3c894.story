A creative pet owner has made sure that her dog turns heads when out for a walk by painting her to look like a tiger.

Dog groomer Jackie Simmonds transformed pint-sized cavachon, Millie, into the big cat by covering her in orange and black stripes with special dye for pets.

The 44-year-old shocked her husband Ian, 47, and their three children, Stephen, 29, Elliott, 16, and Molly, 14, when she unveiled the outrageous look after the two-and-a-half-hour makeover session.

Mrs Simmonds, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, said her family didn't know what to make of their pet's new look when it was debuted last week.

And her creative grooming has proved a hit with neighbours, who stop and ask to take photos with Millie when they see her on the street.

But the RSPCA has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have 'potentially fatal consequences'. 

A spokesman said: 'There is the potential for the dye or paint to be toxic and harm the animals. 

'Although some substances may be labelled as being suitable for human consumption, this does not mean that these substances would therefore be suitable for animals. 

'There are many things which humans can eat and drink which are not safe for animals.'

Mrs Simmonds said: 'I thought I'd try and get into creative grooming and give the family a surprise - who doesn't like tigers?

'My husband looked at me like I was mad and the kids were a bit embarrassed but once they've all seen the reaction she's getting I think they have changed their tune.

'I spent about two and a half hours in total using special dye that you can buy from groomers online for about £7.50.

'Its a trend that's big in the USA and Asia but I think it will finally take off in Britain soon as well.

Striking stripes: Millie's new look has attracted plenty of attention from shop owners and neighbours

'I can't say she's very ferocious looking though she's as soft as anything. She looks like a baby Tigger from Winnie the Pooh.

'When we went up town everybody wanted selfies, from shop owners to the tattoo parlour guys. I spent about two hours in town when I only wanted to pop out for a bit.

'People were beeping their horns and everybody is saying how cute she looks.

'The response has been amazing.'
