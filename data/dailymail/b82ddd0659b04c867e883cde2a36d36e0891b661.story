A diet consultant who stopped taking her own advice was so shocked by pictures of her 18st 7lb frame that she shed a third of her weight.

Slimming World diet coach Liz McGuinness from Wallasey, Wirral, was so mortified by the snaps taken at a weight loss awards ceremony she embarked on a two-year health and fitness plan.

Now the 44-year-old has lost 6st 7lb and inspired her father Richard Owens, 68, to lose 5st in the process.

Liz's new diet and exercise regime has seen her go from 18st 7lb and a size 24 to 12st and a size 12

'I look back at pictures of myself from two years ago and think "that's not me!"' says Liz, who has been a Slimming World consultant at her local Wallasey club for nearly 11 years.

'I wasn't following my own advice. But then I woke up one day and thought "this is my life, it's not a game".

'I used to always wonder what people were thinking about me, I never felt comfortable and I had no energy.'

Describing her fluctuating weight as a 'constant yo-yo' Liz - who is the slimmest she has been since she was 18 - used to gorge on toast with lashings of butter for breakfast, a huge sandwich filled with meat, coleslaw and mayonnaise for lunch and pizza and garlic bread for her evening meal.

In between, the trainer for the Department of Work and Pensions used to snack on chocolate, crisps, sweets, cake and ice cream.

But transforming her body relied on changing her diet. 'It's about cutting out all the junk food and cooking from fresh,' Liz said. 'I still eat plenty and don't go hungry.'

Liz, who is still aiming to lose up to two more stone, now eats a diet of healthy fresh food and exercises 

She also attends a high-intensity Zumba class twice a week. 'It is filled with twentysomethings but I can keep up,' she said.

The diet and exercise regime has seen her slim from a dress size 24 to a size 12 and a svelte 12st - making her eligible for the Consultant Of The Year prize at the upcoming national Slimming World awards - but she still wants to lost another two stone.

Fortunately, her biggest motivation is close to home.

Liz's father Richard Owens, 68, finally addressed his weight after undergoing a heart bypass two years ago.

Liz's father Richard Owens has also shed 5st- meaning the father-and-daughter slimming team have lost a staggering 12st between them

He went to his daughter for help and managed to shed 5st thanks to attending her diet group, giving the father-daughter duo a combined weight loss of 12st between them.

'He's always been in my Slimming World class so we have inspired and motivated each other,' she said.

'We have got one of the biggest classes in Wirral and people look at us for motivation.

'People specifically come to my class and say to me and my dad, "we're here because we've seen your pictures and you're both such an inspiration".'

Since losing the weight, Richard has won the Wallasey Slimming World group's Man of the Year and Mr Sleek of the Year awards.

'He learned he needed to help himself,' says Liz. 'I am so proud of him.'

She added: 'With Slimming World it's all about taking the guilt away from eating and the freedom to eat certain foods freely. And everything is allowed in moderation.'

Today Liz keeps her weight in check by eating fruit with yogurt for breakfast, dishes like homemade chicken fried rice for lunch and a wrap or stew for dinner.

She also cut out wheat and gluten, a protein in wheat, barley and rye, which she says has made a big difference.

Now if Liz and her boyfriend Paul Partridge, 52, go out to eat, she sticks to rice or salads. 'We still like to go out a lot but it's all about making wise choices,' she said.

'It's all about choice. You can't make excuses.

'There's long-term pleasure and then there's short-term pleasure and the most satisfying thing for me is the short-term pleasure of people saying "who's that girl?" and not the short-term pleasure of eating fatty foods.

'People keep calling me petite but I just can't get my head around it. My head needs to catch up with what other people are seeing.'
