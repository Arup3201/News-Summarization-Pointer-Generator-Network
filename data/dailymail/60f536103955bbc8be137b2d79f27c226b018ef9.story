New York state police have launched a public campaign to track down a young woman who allegedly printed off dozens of photos at a Walgreens store without paying. 

The dark-haired woman reportedly used a self-service photo printer at a Walgreens  in Selden around 3pm on January 14.

She apparently thought she could sneakily leave the shop without coughing up cash; however, all of her images were digitally recorded.

After an unsuccessful search, authorities have now released one image in a bid to identify the suspect.

Caught red-handed: New York state police have launched a public campaign to track down a young woman who allegedly printed off dozens of photos at a Walgreens store without paying

The color shot shows the woman staring directly at the camera with her lips pursed. 

She is wearing a thick gold-colored chain necklace, and monochrome striped top. 

Her long, dark hair is styled straight.

Anyone with information is asked to step forward with a $5,000 cash reward on offer. 

Police hoped they would be able to track down the culprit but their hunt proved fruitless.

They released the image of the woman on Wednesday in a bid to put the crime to bed.

The offender is wanted for petit larceny, which carries a one-year maximum prison sentence. 

Anyone with information about any of the photo booth crime is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS.
