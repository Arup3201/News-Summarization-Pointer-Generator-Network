The tables may have turned for the 'most hated man on the Internet.'

Hunter Moore, the man behind the controversial 'revenge porn' website isanyoneup.com, was indicted by a federal grand jury on Thursday for allegedly conspiring with another man to hack into the private email accounts of several victims in search of nude photos he could post on his website. The court sketch artist told MailOnline that Moore did not seem nervous as he faced charges that carry jail time.

The other man indicted is 25-year-old Charles 'Gary' Evans. Both he and Moore have been charged with multiple counts of conspiracy access a protected computer without authorization to obtain information for private financial gain.

From the artist: 

I'm assuming that is Hunter's parents because the attorney was talking to them before court started, and his attorney also mentioned in court that he had been staying with his parents in Woodland (A little town about 20 minutes north west of Sacramento ) and that they were there supporting him in court.

Hunter did not seem nervous. And the reason his hand is up near his face, is to show that it was covered in tattoos. Another person that was in the court room said that the part of his neck I could not see, was covered in tattoos also.

His parents figured out that I was trying to sketch them before the hearing started, and the mother tried to turn her face away f

Hated: Hunter Moore's isanyoneup.com website has earned him the title of 'most hated man on the internet'

'Bully': Moore's website features nude photos of people without their consent. Authorities say he obtained some of the photos by hacking email accounts

According to the indictment, on multiple occasions, Moore paid Evens to break into email accounts and steal nude photos.

In an October 2011 email, authorities say that Moore wrote to Evens that 'they needed to 
create new e-mail accounts and delete evidence of the hacking scheme.'

In other e-mails to Evens, Moore allegedly instructed him to 'hack more' and 'hack all week for me,' presumably referring to hacking into email accounts in search of nude photos.

Moore, 27, earned the title of 'most hated man on the Internet' by using his website to post unflattering photos of people - who are typically female and in most cases naked, or engaging in a sex act - as a form of 'revenge porn.'

Anti-bully: James McGibney won a $250,000 lawsuit against Moore after he claimed McGibney was a pedophile

The photos are often provided to Moore by scorned exes, and posted on the website without the consent of the person in the photograph.

By 2012, Moore's website had essentially become a photographic database of humiliation for hundreds of people - many of whom sought legal avenues to get Moore to remove their photos.

In a 2012 television appearance, Moore was confronted by the mother of one of the women he featured on his website. All he would say to the woman is 'I'm sorry that your daughter was "cyber-raped," but, I mean, now she's educated on technology.'

In March of 2013, Moore was ordered to pay $250,000 to James McGibney, the founder of Bullyville.com - which sought to put an end to Moore's online 'bullying' - for falsely claiming that McGibney was a pedophile.

Good company: Moore tweeted to Justin Bieber - who was in a Florida jail at the time - just moments before he was arrested

For his most recent brush with the law, Moore and Evens face much more than a fine - if convicted the pair  face up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and computer hacking 
counts. The identity theft charges carry 'a mandatory two-year sentence'
 that would run 'consecutive to any other sentence imposed in the case,' according to federal prosecutors. 

Moore was taken into custody this morning - shortly after taking to Twitter to direct a tweet to pop singer Justin Bieber, who was arrested early Thursday morning on charges that he resisted arrest during a DUI stop. The tweet Moore directed at Bieber read 'I’m comin to bust you out lil nigga.'

'We’re ecstatic,' revenge porn activist Charlotte Laws, who has been
 fighting for Moore’s arrest for years and who says her daughter Kayla 
is one of the victims listed in the indictment, told Time.com. 'We’re super pleased 
that the FBI have brought this to fruition. I’ve talked to several of 
the victims and they are extremely pleased and I know all the victims 
are going to feel happy and they are going to feel that finally justice 
is being served.'
