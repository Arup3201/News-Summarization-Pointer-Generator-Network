He is best known for his post-match rants outside Old Trafford but here is Manchester United fan Andy Tate as you have never seen him before delivering a more upbeat verdict following a final whistle in a slightly different environment.

The YouTube sensation, who shot to fame slating David Moyes in a thick Manchester accent last year, works as a steward up the road at Oldham Athletic's Boundary Park to make ends meet.

Word of his presence spread to the Latics players and following their 3-0 derby thumping of neighbours Rochdale on Tuesday night they invited them into a celebrating dressing room.

A video posted by goalkeeper Paul Tyson on Instagram shows Tate, wearing a blue Oldham shirt, in a much happier state of mind.

With giggles in the background, and in his now-famous dulcet tones, he tells them: 'I got this job on a technicality at Boundary Park off (ex-Manchester City boss) Brian Horton but I love it working here and you lot of lads are the best in the division. Good look to you for the rest of the season.'

The victory lifted Oldham to 11th in League One, four points outside the play-offs with eight matches to go.

And with Tate admitting he cannot afford a season ticket at United next season, the blue shirt might be there to stay.
