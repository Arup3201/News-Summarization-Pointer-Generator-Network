Kate McCann felt ‘worthless’ and ‘mentally raped’ after her diary of the days after her daughter vanished was published in the News of the World.

The mother of missing Madeleine told the Leveson Inquiry into press standards yesterday that she wanted to ‘climb into a hole and not come out’.

Mrs McCann and her husband Gerry, both 43, said they felt some of the coverage of Madeleine’s disappearance was ‘nothing short of disgusting’ and that they had faced a virtual trial by media.

Ordeal: Kate and Gerry McCann described the media storm after their daughter Madeleine vanished from a Portuguese holiday apartment in May 2007

Trauma: The McCanns yesterday said their experience at the hands of the media had been 'disgusting'

The couple from Rothley, 
Leicestershire, revealed they had been called  by the editor of the 
now-defunct News of the World, Colin Myler, days before the anniversary 
of Madeleine going missing from their rented Portuguese holiday 
apartment.

Mrs McCann said he made her ‘almost feel guilty’ about giving
 an interview to Hello! magazine, talking about their campaign for a 
Europe-wide alert system for missing children.

Witnesses: Gerry and Kate McCann arrived at the Leveson Inquiry at London's High Court holding hands this morning

Her husband added: ‘It’s fair to say 
Mr Myler was irate when he learned of the publication and was berating 
us for not doing an interview with the News of the World.

‘It was a time of stress for us on 
the first anniversary … he basically beat us into submission, verbally, 
and we agreed to do an interview the day after.’

Four months later, in September 2008,
 a friend told Mrs McCann that her private diary – probably leaked by 
Portuguese police – had been printed in the same newspaper.

The mother of three said: ‘I  felt 
violated. I’d written these words at the most desperate time of my life,
 and it was  my only way of communicating with Madeleine.

‘I recently read through my diary 
entries at that point in that week and I talk about climbing into a hole
 and not coming out because I just felt so worthless that we’d been 
treated like that.’

Mr McCann said he had never read his 
wife’s diary because  it was private, and was shocked by its 
publication.

He told  the inquiry: ‘Kate was distraught and in her words
 felt “mentally raped”.’

The couple said they initially 
received support from the media after Madeleine’s disappearance but the 
tone changed after ‘leaks’ from inside the Portuguese police 
investigation falsely suggested the  couple were involved in Madeleine’s
 disappearance.

The couple were unable to refute the 
allegations as they had been threatened with a two-year jail sentence if
 they broke Portugal’s laws of judicial secrecy which surround any 
police investigation.

The McCanns eventually took legal 
action against the publishers of the Daily Express and the Daily Star, 
who they described as the ‘worst offenders’  among the British media, 
although they criticised every newspaper and broadcaster.

Express Group Newspapers paid £550,000 in damages to the Find Madeleine fund and published a front-page apology.

Separate legal action against the Evening Standard and the Daily Mail was settled out of court, the inquiry heard.

The News of the World  also apologised and made a donation to the Find Madeleine fund after it published Mrs McCann’s diary.
