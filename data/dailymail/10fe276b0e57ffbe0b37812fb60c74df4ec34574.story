Bitter: Michaela Brookes was one of around 100 people who were sent an abusive rejection email by Owston Park Lodge

Applicants for work at a pub in Yorkshire would have been forgiven for thinking the owners had been drinking a bit too much of their own stock after they were sent rude rejection emails telling them 'you're no good'.

The message was sent out to more than 100 people who applied for jobs in the restaurant at Owston Park Lodge in Doncaster.

It read: ‘Unfortunately, you are not good enough for the position at this time, try harder next time.

‘I am sorry for the disappointing news. But what did you expect, your (sic) no good.’

Among those to receive the email was job-seeker Michaela Brookes, who woke to find the message on her phone.

The
 23-year-old said: ‘I was absolutely gobsmacked. I have had knock-backs 
for jobs before, but I couldn't believe what I was reading. It seemed so
 cruel - I couldn't believe someone could say something like that.’

Another
 angry applicant, Danielle Jarvis, said that when she received the email
 she thought it was extremely rude and unprofessional.

She
 said: ‘I am not the only person to have this email sent to me. I have 
seen on the Owston Park Lodge Facebook page several other people 
complaining about this.'

However, the owners of the pub were 'horrified' by the emails.

Paul and Tracy Snow believe their computer system was hacked.

Mrs Snow, who runs Owston Park Lodge in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with her husband, said: ‘We want to put people's minds at rest that this appears to be a malicious prank and we are deeply sorry for any offence the emails may have caused.

‘The police are investigating as we think our system has been hacked and these messages sent out. It has been upsetting and stressful for everyone involved.’

The problem first came to light on Monday, when angry applicants began calling the pub and demanding answers about the emails.

Horrified: Paul and Tracy Snow claim that their computer system was hacked and have apologised for the abusive rejection email

Mrs Snow said: ‘It was the first I knew of it. The calls were coming through in a torrent and people were very upset.’

The pub has since posted an apology on its website and the owners are trying to track down anyone who may have received the email, which was signed off with the couple's full names.

The couple contacted South Yorkshire Police who have confirmed an investigation had been launched.
