Rapper Ryan Leslie is being sued by a New York Police Department detective for using the cop's voice in a break-up song about his supermodel ex-girlfriend without permission.

Australian bombshell Nicole Trunfio called the police on the musician in 2011 after he allegedly refused to stop calling her or knocking on her door.

Detective Luis Mortimer followed up the complaint, leaving a voicemail on Leslie's phone asking him or his lawyer to return his call.

A year later, his message was being broadcast across the world in Leslie's rap song 'Joan of Arc.'

Now Mortimer is now taking Leslie to court after, claiming his career was damaged by the hip-hopper's tune, which ends with the 15-year police veteran's voicemail.

According to The New York Post the jilted rapper was never arrested but he still claimed in the song to have been thrown in a holding cell for 'messin' wit pretty females.'

Other lines in the song include: 'I wake up to detec' messages in my e-mail,'and 'since when a birthday gift is harassment/a rose gold bracelet nothing subliminal/You called your lawyer up said my actions were criminal. Girls play the victim so well â€” Joan of Arc.'

Mortimer only learned of his starring role a few months ago, when he started getting calls about it.

'The song has caused him embarrassment and has damaged his credibility as a detective,' his lawyer, Monica Kipiniak, told The Post.

Mortimer claims Leslie's unauthorised use of his voice is exploitation and violates his civil rights.

He is seeking unspecified damages in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court last week.

In 2010, Leslie reneged on a $1 million reward he offered for the safe return of his missing laptop. The computer was found by a German man walking his dog.
