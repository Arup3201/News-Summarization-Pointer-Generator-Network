A 15-year-old schoolgirl has become the world's youngest sword swallower after secretly teaching herself to consume 18-inch blades.

Haley Hall, from Georgia in the U.S., locked herself in her bedroom to practice the unusual hobby after reading about it in a book when she was just 14.

She spent three months practising in secret before plucking up the courage to tell her parents she had mastered the dangerous art form and is now one of around 25 female sword swallowers in the world.

Haley Hall has mastered the dangerous ancient art form to become one of around just 25 female sword swallowers in the world

The 15-year-old, from Georgia, USA, locked herself in her bedroom to teach herself the unusual hobby using a wire coat hanger and spoon to help relax her gag reflex

Haley - who goes by the stage name 'The 
Amazing Pandora' - said: 'I have always loved performing, and that's how
 I got in to sword swallowing.

'My passion is acting, but I wanted 
to expand my variety of perfomances - I can get out of a straight jacket 
and hand cuffs, sword swallow, and I would like to try fire eating when 
I'm old enough.

'I started 
out using a wire hanger and a wooden spoon before I progressed toswords,
 and I had done a lot of research into the human anatomy so I know how 
everything works.'

She went on: 'My dad knew that something was up - I don't usually lock myself away for hours at a time.

'I
 was really nervous about telling my parents but they have been really 
supportive. They helped me to find out more about it and to choose the 
right sword.

'My mum was really worried for me at first, but she knows that I'm careful. My family always come and watch my performances.

'And
 my friends all think it is really cool, but they did freak out a bit at
 first. I didn't tell any of them about it, so it was a shock for them.'

Haley's dad Jeff and mum Robin 
couldn't believe what their daughter had been keeping secret from them 
for almost three months.

The
 dad-of-three said: 'I was quite surprised when she first told us, but I
 was pleased that she came to us rather than going off on her own, so I 
was happy.

'We have brought the girls up to be really outgoing and none of them are girly so I couldn't really be surprised.

'We
 aren't always the most regular family on the block - I threw tomahawks 
when I was younger so that could be where she gets it from.

'I joked that she just had a bad case of middle child syndrome and really needed to stand out.'

The
 couple say they have always encouraged their
 three girls to pursue a wide range of extra-curricular activities.

Haley is also a black belt in karate,
 shoots guns and bows, and rides dirt bikes with her sisters, Rebecca, 
17, who throws knives, and Maggie, 11, who is skilled at picking locks.

She is now hoping to gain a Guinness World Record certification, and is the
 youngest female member of the International Sword Swallowers 
Association by six years.

Haley has been invited to audition for the next series of America's Got Talent and has performed at a number of events across the US in recent months

Dan Meyer, President of the Sword Swallowers Association International, said: 'In
 my years of research I've found that most sword swallowers seem to 
learn between the ages of 18 and 21, probably because at that age young 
people feel daring and invincible.

'But it is rare to find people serious enough about learning the art much younger than that.

'For
 Haley to learn the art at the age of 14 is very unusual, and for her to
 have her family's support is even rarer still. That she learnt sword 
swallowing through months of solitary practice without a mentor is 
simply amazing.

'However, 
due to the extreme dangers in sword swallowing, we do not condone or 
encourage people to learn sword swallowing - especially not youngsters 
under the age of 18.

'Haley
 has already demonstrated persistence and dedication to studying the 
art, and I am convinced that she is highly committed and not turning 
back, so I have agreed to help mentor Haley with their parents' 
permission.

'I hope to inspire Haley to follow in my footsteps to take this ancient art to new heights in the next generation.'

The teen performed

number of sword swallowing veterans to mark World Sword Swallowers Day.
