A seven-year-old schoolboy has died of meningitis becoming the second British child to die from the infection in the last week.

The youngster, who was a pupil at a primary school in the West Midlands, died in hospital on Monday after contracting meningococcal disease, according to a council spokesman.

His death is likely to raise fears among parents following the death of another child in Berkshire last week but health officials have moved to reassure parents the risks of developing meningitis are rare.

The boy was a pupil at Little Bloxwich Church of England Primary School in Walsall, above

The boy, who has not been named, was a pupil at Little Bloxwich C of E Primary School in Walsall.

A statement released on behalf of Walsall Council said it was working to support the school and also reassure other parents over any public health concerns.

A spokesperson for the Council said: 'Members of Walsall Council's cabinet have tonight sent their deepest sympathies to the family and friends of a seven-year-old who has passed away after contracting meningococcal disease.

'The council and Public Health England are liaising closely with parents and the school community - who are understandably shocked and anxious at this difficult time - to reassure them that while this is an extremely tragic case, it is very rare.'

The boy was treated at Walsall Manor Hospital and later transferred to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent, where he died.

Tests are still under way to establish which strain of the disease was involved, according to officials.

There was a meeting 
at the Grenfell Road site between health officials, support workers and 
parents to discuss symptoms and the ongoing risk to other children.

Anyone who came into close contact with the 
youngster has been offered antibiotics and a letter has also been sent 
to parents setting out the facts about the infection.

Matt Croxall, 
Meningitis Now's community support officer, said: 'There were a lot of 
upset and anxious people at the school, but alongside the PHE team and 
Children's Services, I was able to help dispel some myths and reassure 
parents that although their concerns were understandable, any further 
cases are highly unlikely and that there is no need for any panic.'

He
added there would be further face-to-face support for 'what is an 
extremely emotive and distressing situation for the school community'.

Mr
Croxall added: "Of course our immediate thoughts are with the little 
boy's family, and I have passed on a letter via the school letting them 
know that we are here if and when we are needed."

There
are two types of meningitis, bacterial and viral. Bacterial is the most
dangerous because it can cause septicemia - or blood poisoning, which 
can be fatal.Most people 
know to look out for a rash which doesn't fade when pressed against a 
glass - but this is a later symptom and doesn't always appear.In
babies and very young children, early warning signs include being 
floppy or unresponsive, vomiting or refusing food, and being very sleepy
and reluctant to wake up.The child may also develop a staring expression, pale or blotchy skin, and be irritable and not want to be held.Other symptoms can include having unusually cold hands and feet, blue lips, shivering, and pain in muscles or joints.If you detect any of the above symptoms with a fever, you are advised to call 999 immediately and request an ambulance.Later symptoms are drowsiness, confusion, seizures, sensitivity to bright lights, rapid breathing, and a rash.Viral meningitis can still be serious, but usually has mild flu-like symptoms.

Dr Isabel Gillis, Walsall's director 
of public health, said she was encouraging parents and carers, who know 
their children best, to seek advice if they are at all concerned about 
their health.

She said: 
'Information, which has already been circulated to worried parents, can 
be found on the Meningitis Now website at www.meningitisnow.org.'

Dr
Gillis, colleagues for Public Health England, Meningitis Now and the 
council's interim executive director of children's services, visited the
school yesterday to meet parents and staff, answer their questions and 
offer support.

The boy's death comes after another child died from meningitis in Berkshire last week.

Windsor and Maidenhead Council confirmed the death of a student aged between 9-13 at Dedworth Middle School.

As a precaution, antibiotics were offered to members of the child's family and others who had had close contact.

The age and gender of the child has yet to be confirmed.

After the case, the Department of Health said: 'Letters have been sent to parents of children attending the school informing them of the situation and reassuring them that the risk of any further cases is extremely low.

'The bacteria do not spread easily and those who have had prolonged, close contact with the person with meningitis/septicaemia are at a slightly greater risk of getting ill.'

In October, a baby who fell ill on a flight to his first foreign holiday died hours later from suspected meningitis.

Ten-month-old George Moore became poorly after arriving in Tunisia with his mother and grandparents.

After appearing hot, lethargic and sleepy on landing, he was seen by the hotel doctor who recommended he go to hospital.

But once there his condition deteriorated and despite the best efforts of medical staff he went into cardiac arrest and died.

The schoolboy was rushed to Walsall manor hospital, above, after falling ill

His mother Emma Moore, 24, urged parents to be vigilant and told how the disease struck with shocking speed.

Babies affected by the more dangerous bacterial form of the illness often know to look for a rash which doesn't fade when pressed against a glass, but this a late stage symptom which doesn't alwats appear.

After the recent spate of deaths, parents have been urged to keep an eye out for overheating, a staring expression and unusual lethargy in their babies.
