It was Britain's booziest night of the year when workers let their hair down for Christmas parties across the country.

But while most revellers enjoyed the busiest night of the party season so far, it all got too much for some partygoers on an evening that has been dubbed 'Mad Friday'.

Police forces brought in extra officers to cope with demand and hospitals were on high alert as Britons put their health and safety at risk by opting for one drink too many.

As boozed-up revellers recover from the night before, here is a roundup of some of the messiest moments.
