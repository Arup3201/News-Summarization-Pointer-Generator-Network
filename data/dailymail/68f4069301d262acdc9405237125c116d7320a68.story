A Colorado plane crash last near Denver May was likely caused by the pilot and passenger taking selfies on board.

The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) report published yesterday on the crash that killed two people says that a GoPro camera was found among the wreckage. The plane was fully operational.

Video footage from the camera showed the pilot Amritpal Singh and a passenger, who hasn't been publicly identified, taking selfies at dangerously low altitudes.

CBS reports that a Cessna 150 crashed in a field two miles from Front Range Airport while the plane was doing night-time takes offs and landings.

His flight took off at around 12:30 a.m. on May 31 and family members reported him missing a few hours later at 3:45 a.m.

The wreckage was discovered at 7 a.m. that morning. Neither Singh nor the passenger survived the crash.

The NTSB said the 29-year-old pilot who also owned the plane did not meet the requirements for night flights with passengers.  

'Pilot and passengers were taking self-photographs with their cell phones’ the NTSB report states.

The report also said that the passengers were using the camera's flash function at night which may have distracted the pilot.

One of the pilot's professors at Metro State University, Jeff Price, said that Singh loved to fly but that he shouldn't have been taking photographs.

Price speculated the flash function on the camera may have startled him while flying.

Price said he once got distracted while flying his own plane when someone took a flash picture and he thought it was lightning.

'A post-accident examination of the airplane did not reveal any pre-impact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Based on the wreckage distribution, which was consistent with a high-speed impact, and the degraded visual reference conditions, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation and lost control of the airplane,' said the report.

GoPro: The plane showed no signs of functional abnormalities and a GoPro (which may have resembled this one) found on board showed that the pilot and passenger were taking selfies while in flight
