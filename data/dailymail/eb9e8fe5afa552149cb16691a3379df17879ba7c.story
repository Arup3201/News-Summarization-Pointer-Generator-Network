One of Britain's worst boxers has lost his 51st fight in a row after being defeated on Saturday.

'Rockin' Robin Deakin, 27, who has not won since his first professional bout in 2006, lost on points to 'Polish pugilist' Damian Lawniczak after 13 rounds.

Despite his appalling record Mr Deakin has vowed to keep fighting, saying 'struggle has become my identity.'

Deakin, from Essex, is ranked 85th of 88 in the UK light welterweight division on website BoxRec

Deakin has continued his poor run of form with his 51st defeat in  row after losing on Saturday

After 13 rounds the judges ruled in favour of his opponent, Polish fighter Damian Lawniczak

Despite his poor form, Deakin took to Twitter after the bout to say he wouldn't give up on the sport

Mr Deakin, of East Tilbury, Essex, said on Twitter: 'I have had my confidence knocked so much. Dunno what to do. Got the talent just can’t get out of this rut. #gutted

'The hardest part of ending is starting. Struggle has become my identity, I prepared for the fight.

'The occasion got to me. Thanks for all the loyaly. I will still fight. I won’t quit #boxing.'

Robin, who reckons he had been training harder than ever before for Saturday’s bout, blamed nerves on his in-ring failures.

Deakin said that 'struggle has become part of my identity' after the defeat adding that he loses focus in the ring

Deakin had success as an amateur and won his first professional fight in 2006, but has lost every one since

Last year the British Boxing Board of Control withdrew his licence over fears for his health meaning he had to travel to Germany in order to get a permit to carry on

He added: 'Loads going on in my head. Doing over time. Need a great trainer work on conditioning and my mental condition. I suffer with nerves real bad.

'The things that almost break you, are the things to make you strong. Strengths do not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths.'

Mr Deakin is officially ranked 85th out of 88 UK fighters in the light welterweight category, according to website BoxRec, and has suffered more knockouts than any other fighter in the division with 12.

Robin’s manager, Dave Murphy said: 'We’ve given Robin the training and the support he needs.

'Robin has been given the chance to prove his worth, and I think he shows that in everything he does.'

With 12 knockouts, Deakin has been rendered unconscious more times than anyone else in his division

However Deakin's record is still better than Peter Buckley who quit the sport in 2008 after losing 256 out of 300 professional fights

Robin turned pro after a successful amateur career which saw him win 40 out of 75 bouts, including making it to the semi-finals of the British Youth Championships.

The UK’s boxing regulatory authority, the British Boxing Board of Control, suspended Mr Deakin’s licence in 2012 when they began worrying for his health.

Last month Mr Deakin was granted a permit in Germany which has allowed him to carry on fighting.

His record is still better than Peter Buckley who quit the sport in 2008 after losing 256 out of 300 professional fights.
