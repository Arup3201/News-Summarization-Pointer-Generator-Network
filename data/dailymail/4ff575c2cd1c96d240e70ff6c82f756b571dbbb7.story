John Dehlin, 45, has been booted from the Mormon church after refusing to shutdown  a website that  offers doubting members a forum to chat

A Mormon man  has been kicked out of the religion after refusing to shut down a popular website that offers doubting church members a forum to chat. 

John Dehlin, who has run Mormonstories.org for a decade, was unanimously excommunicated by regional church members on Tuesday for 'apostasy,' which is defined as repeatedly opposing the faith in a public manner.

The father-of-four has publicly stated his belief that the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham are fraudulent and has rejected the Mormon religion as being the 'true church with power and authority for God.' 

He has also discussed the church's unflattering history, including its polygamous past under founder Joseph Smith - who had a teen bride and married other men's wives.

Dehlin said he was told last year that his well-known support for same-sex marriage was also one of the reasons he was being accused of apostasy, although a spokesman for the church disputed his claims.

The popular podcaster received a letter informing him of his excommunication, considered the harshest punishment available for a church member.

Dehlin, 45, has been a member of the church since birth. 

The letter, which came from regional church leader Bryan King, said Dehlin is being kicked out  not because he doubted and asked questions about church doctrine, but because he made categorical statements opposing the faith that were disseminated on his website. 

King said that Dehlin's actions have led others to leave the faith, citing his claims that the sacred texts of the Latter Day Saints were fraudulent and his rejection of the Mormon church as the sole religion with authority from God.

'You do not have the right to remain a member of the church in good standing while openly and publicly trying to convince others that church teachings are in error,' he wrote.

The decision came two days after Dehlin, who lives in North Logan, Utah, met with church leaders for a four-hour disciplinary hearing. 

Dehlin told church leaders he hoped he wouldn't be excommunicated but could not in good conscience stop operating his website. 

'We're going to keep telling stories and keep providing support and community for Mormons who are unorthodox,' he said in a statement following his removal on Tuesday.

Dehlin is the second high-profile church member to be kicked out in the past year. Kate Kelly, founder of a group pushing for women to be allowed in the religion's lay clergy, was removed from the religion last June.

Scholars say Kelly and Dehlin are the most high-profile examples of excommunication proceedings since 1993. 

That year, the church disciplined six Mormon writers who questioned church doctrine.

Dehlin supporter and active Mormon Mike Huband said the church was sending a message with Dehlin and Kelly's removals.

'Don't express your doubts or concerns publicly, or you risk excommunication. They are saying to those people on the fringes, "We don't want you in the church."' 

'It's very disappointing.' 

Huband said Dehlin helped him navigate a recent faith crisis and figure out a way to focus on the positives of Mormonism and stay in the religion. 

To supporters like Huband, Dehlin is a hero who risked his standing in the faith to create a much-needed forum where church members could openly discuss sensitive or controversial issues about the faith. 

About 200 supporters held a weekend vigil for Dehlin outside the church building where his disciplinary hearing took place. Excommunication is considered the harshest punishment available for a church member

About 200 supporters held a weekend vigil for Dehlin outside the church building where his disciplinary hearing took place. 

To his detractors, Dehlin is a Latter-day Saint who long ago stopped believing in the faith's core tenets and has painted himself as a martyr.

Scott Gordon, co-founder of pro-Latter Day Saints organization MormonVoices, said Dehlin's excommunication was necessary to protect people in the religion.  

'Dehlin's choices forced his local leaders to take steps to protect their adherents from one who not only ceased to believe, but who actively sought to have others embrace his disbelief,' he said. 

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints spokesman Eric Hawkins said people who are kicked out of the church are welcome to return 'through the grace and Atonement of Jesus Christ'.

He called excommunication the 'beginning of the road back to full fellowship'.  

As for Dehlin, he and his family haven't been attending church services since June. 

He said they do not plan to return and are 'happy to use our Sundays to bond together as a family'. 

Dehlin, who has faced church discipline multiple times over the past decade, said he has no regrets for trying to help fellow church members deal with their doubts.

Regional church leaders said Dehlin's actions have led others to leave the faith, citing his claims that the Books of Mormon and Abraham were fraudulent and his rejection that the Mormon church was the 'true church with power and authority for God'
