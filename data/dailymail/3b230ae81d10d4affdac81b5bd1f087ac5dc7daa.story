The family of a tragic mother who died after jumping from a cliff on Dartmoor and whose two children were also killed, has spoken about their loss today.

Relatives paid tribute to Kat Hooper, 24 and her two sons Josh, five and Sam, two, and shared some intimate photos of the young family.

Kat and Josh were found dead at the bottom of Haytor rock on Friday afternoon. When police went to her home in Paignton, Devon, they found the youngest son dead in his bed.

Kat’s partner Neil Patterson, 52, is currently on bail awaiting trial for assaulting her back in April. He denies the allegation.

Yesterday Kat’s family said: 'We are finding it very hard to come to terms with the tragic deaths of Katherine, Josh and Sam.

'All were greatly loved and their deaths have left us devastated. We are assisting the police to try and establish the facts of what has happened.

'We are a strong family unit and ask that we are left alone to grieve in peace.'

Post mortem examinations are being carried out on the three family members.

Meanwhile, tributes have been paid to Kat by friends and Josh’s school is offering counselling to its staff and pupils.

Debbie Main, the headteacher, said: 'We are all extremely shocked and saddened by this tragic news.

'Joshua was an amazing little boy whose bubbly personality and huge smile brightened everyone¿s day,' his headteacher said. Josh, right, and his brother Sam, left, both died on Friday

Friends have criticised welfare services after Kat, pictured laughing and playing with her sons, tried to kill herself in the past. Her children were returned to her care just two weeks later

'Joshua was an amazing little boy whose bubbly personality and huge smile brightened everyone’s day.'

Joshua Patterson was a pupil at Roselands Primary School in Paignton.

It emerged on Sunday that the family was under a safeguarding intervention scheme.

Welfare agencies were accused last 
night of failing the two young boys murdered by their mother after it 
emerged they were returned to her care despite her attempting suicide 
just weeks ago.

Police had 
previously described Hoooper as ‘high risk’ after she took an overdose 
following a furious row with the father of her children, who faces 
charges of assaulting her.

Now a serious case review has been ordered after friends and neighbours claimed they had ‘slipped through the net’.

On
Friday, she allegedly smothered the younger boy in his bed at their 
terrace home in Paignton, Devon, before taking his brother to the 100ft 
cliff on Dartmoor, putting him on her shoulders and leaping off in front
of horrified day-trippers.

As
friends left toys and flowers outside the family’s house, those closest
to Miss Hooper said authorities must be held responsible for failing to
prevent the tragedy.

Janette Nolan, 53, a friend who lives nearby, said: ‘Social services should have been protecting her.

‘She
was lovely, innocent, caring and kind but seemed vulnerable and lost. I
think she was frightened of her future as a single mother.’

Miss
Hooper, whose mother died of cancer last year, was awaiting the trial 
next month of her estranged partner of seven years, 52-year-old Mr 
Patterson. He is accused of attacking her on April 28 at their home.

Shortly afterwards she took an overdose of pills before running away.

Police
launched a helicopter search and public appeal to find her, describing 
her as a ‘high-risk vulnerable person’, and she was discovered 24 hours 
later face down in a field suffering from hypothermia.

Mr Patterson was subsequently served with a restraining order.

Last night Miss Hooper’s brother Timothy, 31, said: ‘Katherine was a loving mum.

‘We know nothing. That’s probably the hardest part to come to terms with, trying to understand as a family what’s happened.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
