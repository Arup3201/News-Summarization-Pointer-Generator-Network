A British woman charged with drug trafficking is awaiting sentence on the Indonesian resort of Bali.

Rachel Dougall was arrested for allegedly being at the centre of a scheme to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine into the country in May.

It was previously thought that the 38-year-old might face death by firing squad - which is mandatory for drug smuggling on the island. Instead, prosecutors are said to be asking the court to sentence her to just a year in a Balinese jail.

Looking worn: Rachel Dougall listens to her translator during her court trial in Denpasar, Bali, today, after she was arrested for being part of a scheme to smuggle 4.8kg of cocaine into the country

Dougall was arrested along with her 43-year-old partner, Julian Ponder, and two other Britons on suspicion of being part of an international drug-smuggling syndicate.

The four suspects were caught in a sting operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly caught with the drugs at Bali's Denpasar airport when she arrived from Bangkok on May 19.

Customs officials allegedly found 10.3lb (4.8kg) of cocaine wrapped in pink gift paper and stuffed in the lining of her suitcase.

Bali's head of Customs, Mr Made Wijaya, said 'there had been no attempt to conceal it.'

He claimed Sandiford had previously met up with Dougall in a Bangkok airport cafe, where she had been given a SIM card for her mobile phone. Sandiford then allegedly made a 'dry run' a few days before she was found with the drugs.

Of Dougall, he said: 'She ordered the 
drugs. She organised this. Rachel was telling Lindsay what to do. Rachel
made the first contact with Lindsay.'

'Organiser': Dougall, 38, looked haggard as she listened to the evidence against her. Prosecutors claim she was at the centre of an international drugs syndicate

Police believe Dougall and Ponder were the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on the island.

Dougall has consistently protested her innocence since her arrest, insisting she was the victim of a 'fit-up', but police said they had a 'very strong case'.

It is believed Sandiford, from Redcar, Teesside, decided to co-operate with the police over a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice.

They told her she would face the death penalty unless she helped trap the other suspected members of the drugs gang.

A sting was set up allowing Sandiford to
keep the drugs with her in a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was 
accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be 
contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate.

Police claim Ponder turned up at the 
hotel while the fourth Briton, Paul Beales, whom they believe was the 
gang's 'muscle', waited nearby.

Depressed: She was said to be concerned for the welfare of her six-year-old daughter, who was living with her maid and gardener

Accused: Dougall with her partner and fellow suspect Julian Ponder

Ponder has alleged that he was set up by Sandiford as he went to pick up a birthday present for his daughter.

Dougall and Ponder's plush Bali villa 
was built on 17,222 sq ft of land bought in 2009 — the year after Ponder's UK-based party-organising business was liquidated with huge 
debts.

The luxurious property is worth at least
$300,000 (£195,000) on the local market — a small fortune in Indonesia,
where the minimum wage is about £100 a month.

It is located in the village of Desa 
Belalang in Tabanan, about an hour's drive from Bali's main tourist 
areas. The couple began living here with their daughter earlier this year and are also believed to own a property in Cyprus.

'Co-operating': The four suspects were caught in a sting operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly stopped with the drugs at Bali's Denpasar airport

Suspect: Paul Beales, right, was also arrested on suspicion of being the 'muscle' of the group

In June, a month after her arrest, Dougall declared herself frightened for the welfare of their six-year-old daughter, who was then being cared for by the family's maid and her gardener husband on the island.

The Foreign Office said British officials were helping Dougall's daughter as well as the arrested Britons.

It is believed Sandiford told police she only agreed to make the smuggling trip because her children in England were being threatened.

If the four are found guilty, they could be transferred to the notorious Kerobokan jail, or Hotel K as it is chillingly known, where up to 11 prisoners at a time are forced to share single cells. There are currently 90 inmates awaiting execution at 'Hotel K.'
