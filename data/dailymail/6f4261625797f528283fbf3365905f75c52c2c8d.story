Today show co-host Savannah Guthrie has announced that she is engaged to her boyfriend of four years, political consultant and former Democratic adviser Mike Feldman.

The 41-year-old grinned as she made the announcement on the Today show on Monday morning, showing off a large ring to her colleagues and the audience.

She revealed that Feldman had popped the question this weekend.

'I got engaged at the weekend,' she 
said. 'Mike Feldman - who I adore. We've been together four years so, as
he said, no one can accuse us of rushing into anything.

'I'm really happy. We're really excited.'

Co-host Matt Lauer had tweeted an image of Savannah flashing her ring earlier on Monday morning - but she said it had taken a while for her colleagues to notice it.

'I was wearing this ring hoping one of my colleagues might notice,' she said, adding that she had been eating her oatmeal and hugging the other hosts in a way so that they would see the sparkler.

'But no one noticed!' she said to their laughter.

Matt Lauer quipped: 'You could have seen it from across the room.'

She also shared her excitement with Kathie Lee and Hoda, revealing that she had been with Feldman on the Turks and Caicos Islands and drinking champagne when he got down on one knee.

But at first she didn't take it seriously - believing that he was simply talking about getting married.

'I only realized when he brought out the ring box,' she said. 'I was just so overcome.'

Feldman also called into the show and said he had been nervous ahead of popping the question 'but figured there'd be a secondary market for diamonds like that' if she said no.

'I was very, very, very happy when she said yes,' he said. 'I'm the luckiest guy in the world.'

Mr Feldman, 44, was a former aide to Al Gore and heads up a successful communications advisory firm based in Washington, D.C. and New York.

Last year, in an interview with 
Vogue, Savannah, who divorced her first husband in 2009, spoke out about
her desire for a family.

'I
imagine people might look at me and think "Oh, she has been 
single-mindedly working on her career all these years and those family 
issues have fallen by the wayside", but that is absolutely not the 
case,' she said.

'I would 
never put my job before my family. I have all the same hopes that most 
women have. I want to get married and have kids; it just hasn't 
happened.'

Savannah divorced TV producer Mark Orchard in 2009 after four years of marriage, and began dating Mr Feldman that same year.

It had been rumoured that she had 
called the relationship off when she moved to New 
York for her job on the Today show, but last year it was reported that he had bought an apartment close to hers in lower Manhattan.

Miss Guthrie unwittingly found herself at the center of a huge row after Today host Ann Curry was sacked in June - after just one year as Matt Lauer's co-host.

The subsequent backlash among viewers has led to ratings plummeting, and the NBC show has now been overtaken in the ratings war by its ABC rival Good Morning America - which is now the number one breakfast show in the US.
