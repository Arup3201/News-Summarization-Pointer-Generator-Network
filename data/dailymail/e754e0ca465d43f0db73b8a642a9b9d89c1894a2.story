George Osborne warned that Ed Miliband had returned British politics to a Berlin Wall-era battle between the statist left and the free market right.

The Chancellor said that the argument that the right thought it had won in 1989 – that free markets were the best way to promote prosperity – had re-emerged.

While Labour figures like Tony Blair understood that the world had moved on since the Cold War, Mr Miliband was stuck in the past – putting businesses in danger.

George Osborne - speaking at the Institute of Directors annual conference at the Royal Albert Hall today - said Ed Miliband had returned British politics to a battle between left and right for the first time since the 1980s

Speaking at the Institute of Directors, Mr Osborne said: 'There is a big argument in our country about our future, about whether we are a country that is for business, for enterprise, for the free market.

'For the first time since my adult life, that is up for grabs,' he said. 'That issue felt it had been resolved when the Berlin Wall fell.'

Mr Osborne added: 'Politicians like Tony Blair form the left felt like they had understood that free markets create the taxes to fund public services and the like.

'That argument has gone and you saw it with the very stark contrast between the two political conferences in the last two weeks.

The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989, marking the end of the Cold War

'I would urge the business community not to sit on the side-lines of the political debate that is going to happen over the next seven months.

'It doesn't mean you have to endorse a party, a party like the conservatives, but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument.

'That is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise, business low-tax economy which deliver prosperity for generations to come.'

Mr Osborne's remarks came after he lambasted Mr Miliband at the Tory Party conference in Birmingham earlier this week.

The Chancellor said the next election would be hard for the Tories to win but said Labour would struggle because of its leader.

He claimed David Cameron 'knocks the socks off Ed Miliband'.

Mr Osborne said: 'By a massive margin he is seen as the person to lead our country, the person who looks the part, who has got what it takes to be our Prime Minister and to continue being our Prime Minister.

'Of course there is a lamentable Labour leader who fails in every regard to fill those shoes that you need to fill if people see you as someone who could occupy 10 Downing Street.'

Mr Cameron and Tony Blair had looked like prime ministers-in-waiting, before entering No 10 but 'that is not what the country sees today with Ed Miliband and that is a massive advantage for us at this election'.

While the Tories had ideas for the future, Labour was 'a backward-looking party that is still settling scores from the past'.
