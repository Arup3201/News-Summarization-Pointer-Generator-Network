Team news

Stoke 

Stoke seem certain to be without defender Robert Huth for Wednesday's Capital One Cup fourth-round clash with Southampton.

The German suffered a calf injury in training on Monday that the Potters fear could rule him out for a number of weeks.

Full-back Phil Bardsley is available despite continuing to struggle with soreness in his back but midfielder Glenn Whelan remains on the sidelines with a fractured leg.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Wilson, Shawcross, Pieters, Cameron, Bardsley, Muniesa, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Ireland, Walters, Arnautovic, Bojan, Assaidi, Moses, Crouch, Diouf. 

Sadio Mane celebrates scoring  for Southampton against Stoke with manager Ronald Koeman on Saturday

Southampton 

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is expected to make changes to his starting line-up as his side go head-to-head with Stoke for the second time in five days.

Koeman has a full squad to choose from ahead of the Capital One Cup fourth-round clash at the Britannia Stadium after no players reported problems from the weekend's 1-0 victory over Mark Hughes' men. 

The Dutchman has made changes in Saints' two previous outings in the cup, so fringe players Maya Yoshida, Florin Gardos and Victor Wanyama could be in line for a starting berth.

Provisional squad: Forster, Davis, Cropper, Clyne, Fonte, Gardos, Alderweireld, Bertrand, Targett, Schneiderlin, Davis, Wanyama, Reed, Cork, Tadic, Yoshida, Mane, Long, Mayuka, Pelle, Gallagher.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

The Potters have lost three of their last five League Cup matches at the Britannia Stadium.

Southampton have only kept two clean sheets in 33 previous away games against Stoke in all competitions.

Despite that, the Solent side have scored in each of their last 11 trips to Stoke.

Stoke are aiming to reach the quarter-finals for a successive season for the first time in their history; they were beaten 2-0 by Manchester United in the last eight in 2013/14.

Saints have not made the quarter-finals of the League Cup since 2003/04; they have lost four fourth round ties since then.

Southampton have only won two of their last 10 League Cup games against Premier League sides (D1 L7), though they did beat Arsenal 2-1 in this season’s third round.
