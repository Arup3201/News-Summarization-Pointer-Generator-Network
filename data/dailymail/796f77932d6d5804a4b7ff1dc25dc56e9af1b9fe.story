Toast: George Osborne is the toast of British drinkers after cutting the price of a pint by 1p

The Chancellor today made a pre-election bid for popularity by announcing cuts to the price of beer and bingo in the penultimate Budget before Britain heads to the polls next year.

George Osborne cut duty on every pint of beer by 1p, froze tax on cider and spirits and scrapped plans to increase duty on wine above the rate of inflation.

The move is part of a populist push by the Chancellor to undo the damage caused by measures such as the hated 'pasty tax' featured in the 2012 Budget, which drew a massive backlash amidst accusation the Government was out of touch with ordinary people.

Mr Osborne provided a 
boost to the flood-hit West Country by freezing duty on cider, while the
 announcement that the price of spirits will not rise was apparently 
aimed at Scotland ahead of autumn's independence referendum.

'Pubs saved, jobs created, a penny off a pint for the second year running,' the Chancellor said.

The brewing industry said the move will protect 7,000 jobs, mainly of younger people working in pubs and bars.

Brigid
 Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, 
said: ‘This is fantastic news, and George Osborne is again the toast of 
Britain’s brewers, pubs and pubgoers.

‘It also shows that the Government has understood our case, that taxes on British beer had become far too high, and action was long overdue.

‘I hope this becomes a trend in future budgets for this British-made, lower-strength drink.’

Mr Osborne used the Budget to offer headline-grabbing tax cuts to voters after years of austerity

Mike Benner, chief executive of the 
Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), said: ‘Camra is delighted to see the 
Chancellor implementing an unprecedented second consecutive cut of 1p in
 beer duty. This is not only about keeping the price of a pint 
affordable in British pubs but helping an industry which has been in 
overall decline continue on its long road to recovery.

‘Camra
 cares greatly about the future of the great British pub and it is clear
 from this Budget announcement that the Government do too.

‘Keeping the price 
of a pint affordable is vital for the long-term health of the pub sector
 and Camra would hope this latest vote of confidence in British pubs 
will go some way to slowing the rate of closures, by encouraging more 
people to make use of their local this summer.

‘No
 doubt many of our 160,000 members will be raising a glass to the 
Chancellor this evening to toast another brilliant Budget for British 
beer drinkers.’

Safeguard: The beer industry said Osborne's move will protect 7,000 jobs

In a further boost for publicans, Mr Osborne announced plans to scrap above-inflation tax duties on alcohol - despite warnings from health experts in the run-up to the Budget.

In February, the Alcohol Health Alliance warned that axing the escalator would be 'madness', and called on the Chancellor to maintain the alcohol duty escalator - which normally goes up by inflation plus 2% each year.

Chancellor George Osborne has ignored advice from leading medics by abandoning above-inflation tax duties on alcohol.

In February, the Alcohol Health Alliance warned that axing the alcohol duty escalator would be 'madness', and in a letter to Mr Osborne said if the rise was to be screapped it would put 'even more pressure on public services and frontline workers'.

The alliance - which is made up of leading health bodies including the Royal College of Physicians, the British Medical Association, charity Alcohol Concern and the Institute of Alcohol Studies - called on Mr Osborne to maintain the alcohol duty escalator - which normally goes up by inflation plus 2% each year.

Katherine Brown, director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said: 'Today's announcement to scrap the alcohol duty escalator is staggering. With alcohol costing the country £21 billion a year, and alcohol-related hospital admissions more than doubling over the last ten years, it comes as a shock to learn that the Chancellor believes that it is right to further incentivise drinking by making alcohol cheaper.

'Alcohol is 61per cent more affordable today than it was in 1980 and current duty rates for strong white cider amount to just 6p per unit.

'Yet the Chancellor appears to think that this isn't cheap enough.

'This decision, similar to the u-turn on minimum pricing, has been taken following an intense and aggressive lobbying campaign from the drinks industry. It is yet more evidence to suggest the Government has turned its back on public health and frontline workers such as nurses and police offers, who have to mop up the mess that alcohol creates day in day out.'

But Mr Osborne scrapped the escalator, saying: 'We've introduced new laws to prevent alcohol being sold below minimum tax rates, and this helps prevent supermarkets undercutting pubs, and helps stop problem drinking.

'It's a far more targeted approach than the alcohol duty escalator hated by many responsible drinkers.'

He said that the duties on alcohol would rise with inflation, but other alcohol duties have been frozen altogether.

'Scottish Whisky is a huge British success story,' he said.

'To support that industry, instead of raising duties on whisky and other spirits, I am today going to freeze them.

'And with some cider makers in the West Country hit hard by the recent weather, I am going to help them by freezing the duty on ordinary cider too.'

Eric Appleby, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, questioned the move.

He said: 'Once again this Government has cast aside the health of the nation to protect the interests of big alcohol.

'The notion that this freeze is about protecting responsible drinkers is irresponsible spin - alcohol misuse costs us all £21 billion a year, our hospitals weigh under the burden of it and our police forces are stretched to the limit because of it. Instead of taking serious, evidence-based action the Chancellor has given the alcohol industry the green light to make bigger profits at all of our expense.

'This freeze makes a mockery of the Government's ban on below cost sales, rendering it even less effective than it would have been.

'Until we treat alcohol misuse as the huge public health issue it is, like smoking, we will all continue to pay billions to deal with it.'

Meanwhile, bingo players will now be able to claim bigger prizes after gambling duty was slashed from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, lower than the 15 per cent for online gambling and betting on horse races.

Bingo clubs are closing at a rate of one a month, according to the Bingo Association. More than 1,000 jobs have been lost since 2012.

The industry had promised to invest an extra £30million in new clubs, better community facilities and more jobs if the duty was reduced to 15 per cent.

A petition signed by 300,000 people backing the Boost Bingo campaign was presented to Number 11 Downing Street last month.

However, The Chancellor was critcised by health campaigners for missing an opportunity to end the ‘ridiculous’ situation of a pack of cigarettes costing less in real terms than it did in the 1960s.

Tobacco duty will rise by two per cent above inflation, and the escalator will be extended for the rest of the next Parliament.

Money Dashboard has analysed the spending of 20,000 users to work out the current UK average spending on alcohol and cigarettes and how today’s Budget increases will affect it over the course of a year.For Alcohol:•The average UK spend on alcohol was previously £1,708 per year. Following the 2014 Budget, this will increase only at the rate of inflation to £1727.76 - a yearly increase of £19.76. Beer drinkers, who saw a 1p cut per pint, will save on average £5.63 per year.

For Cigarettes:•The average UK spend on cigarettes was previously £565 per year. Following the 2014 Budget, this will increase to £634.06 - a yearly increase of £69.06.

Gavin Littlejohn, Founder and CEO of Money Dashboard comments: 'With taxation on things like cigarettes and alcohol increasing, your average consumer will need to look long and hard at their finances to see where these additional costs will come from. Whilst a 2% increase in tax on cigarettes above inflation may not sound like much, over the course of the year, it could in fact jeopardise the chance to buy that dress or suit you've had your eye on.'

British Lung Foundation chief executive Dr Penny Woods said: ‘By not heeding the recommendations of health experts to increase tobacco taxation by five per cent above inflation, the Chancellor has missed a great opportunity to help put an end to this ridiculous situation in which a pack of cigarettes today costs less in real terms than it did in the 1960s.

‘This Government has made encouraging moves on issues such as standardised packaging and smoking in cars carrying children to try and cut the impact smoking has on the nation's health.

‘However, with research showing taxes to be one of the most effective tools in encouraging people to quit smoking, medical professionals and health campaigners around the country will be disappointed with the Chancellor's decision not to use this tool to the extent so many of them have called for.

‘A five per cent real terms increase in tobacco taxation may only have increased the cost of a pack of cigarettes by a few pence, but the evidence suggests it could have saved thousands of lives into the future.’

The Tobacco Retailers' Alliance (TRA) said the 2% increase played into the hands of tobacco smugglers.

TRA spokeswoman Debbie Corris said: ‘With the Chancellor's announcement, smugglers will now make even more profit, encouraging more of them to ply their illegal trade in communities across the UK, selling to customers no matter what their age.

‘This in turn will mean lost sales for legitimate retailers like myself.’

Giving his reaction to the Budget 2014, John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: 'Business wanted a Budget that was disciplined, focused, and geared towards the creation of wealth and jobs – and that’s what the Chancellor has delivered.

'As with any Budget, there were some populist measures that were not at the top of business’s wish list. Luckily, these were far outweighed by considered measures to support business growth and wealth creation.'
