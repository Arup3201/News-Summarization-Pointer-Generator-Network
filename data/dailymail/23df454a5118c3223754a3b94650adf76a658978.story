Japanese officials says efforts to free a captive journalist from Islamic State extremists have reached a 'state of deadlock'.

The fate of veteran war reporter Kenji Goto has been linked to that of another hostage, Jordanian fighter pilot Lt. Muath Kaseasbeh, with the extremists threatening to kill both of them.

Jordan and Japan are reportedly conducting indirect negotiations with the militants who control a third of both Iraq and Syria.

A threat by the militants to kill the pilot at sunset on Thursday - unless an al-Qaeda prisoner was released by Jordan - has passed without word on the fate of the two hostages.

Japan's deputy foreign minister, Yasuhide Nakayama, told journalists in Amman last night that 'the situation is in a state of deadlock.'

He said: 'Staying vigilant, we will continue analysing and examining information as the government is making concerted efforts together.'

Meanwhile, it has been reported that the family Kassasbeh has received no word on his fate since the threat to kill him earlier this week.

ISIS had vowed to kill Kassasbeh by sunset on Thursday unless Amman hands over an Iraqi female jihadist in return for Goto.

Jordan has offered to free Rishawi, who was convicted for her part in triple-hotel bombings in Amman in 2005 that killed 60 people, if ISIS releases the pilot.

Amman has been under heavy pressure from Tokyo -- a major aid donor -- to save Goto, as well as calls from Jordanians to bring Kassasbeh home.

While ISIS threatened Kassasbeh's life, it was not clear from its latest message if the jihadist group was ready to free him as part of an exchange.

ISIS had set the Thursday sunset deadline for Rishawi to be released at the Turkish border in return for Goto but there was no news of a swap.

Japan, which plays no military part in the fight against ISIS, was thrust onto the front line last week when a video appeared in which Goto and Haruna Yukawa, a self-described contractor, were seen kneeling in the desert.

A masked, knife-wielding militant said Tokyo had 72 hours to pay a $200million ransom if it wanted to spare their lives.

When that deadline expired, new pictures appeared to show Yukawa had been beheaded, and a voice identifying itself as Goto demanded the release of Rishawi.
