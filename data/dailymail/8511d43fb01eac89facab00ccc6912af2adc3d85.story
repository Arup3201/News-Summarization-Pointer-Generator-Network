Health officials say the murder-suicide of a Canadian mother and her autistic son should serve as a wake-up call that drastic changes need to be made within the system.

The bodies of 40-year-old Angie Robinson and her 16-year-old son Robert were found inside their home in Prince Rupert, British Colombia, on April 3, reported The Province.

Robert was so autistic he could not speak and would often express his frustration by heat-butting walls and people and pushing and shoving his loving, 100-pound single mother.

A suicide note left by the mom, coupled with her final Facebook post, showed she felt she could longer manage Robert and that Family Services could not provide adequate support.

Tragic: Angie Robinson had pleaded for help with her autistic son Robert - whose episodes would often turn violent - but she was unable to receive any

A series of strainful incidents with saw Angie determine 'she had lost Robert', according to family, and so she pleaded with a social worker to find a long-term placement for her son.

On April 2 she was informed a long-term placement wasn't possible.

She took to Facebook at 11.56am that day and wrote: 'More, more, more needs to be done for our teens with special needs, they are neglected ... Canada needs more residential and respite care for families hoping to keep their children at home.'

At 3.30pm, her sister, Michelle Watson, called, but Angie asked for her to call the following day.

When Angie didn't answer any calls or texts on April, Michelle and her husband Ron went to her home.

After knocking for 20 minutes without a response they called police.

'The officers broke down the door and then came out, and told us not to come inside,' Ron Watson told The Province.

'They told us that Robert was found resting peacefully in his bed.'

Angie is believed to have given Robert a lethal dose of the sedative Ativan.

Their deaths have rocked the family.

'Angie loved him more than anything on Earth,' Ron Watson said.

'The shock for us was that she took his life'

However the signs had been there for a while.

In early March, Robert smashed his thread through the rear window of Angie's pick up truck during an episode.

Another episode landed him in hospital, where he was given a steady stream of Ativan pills for two hours until he calmed down.

The hospital released them, giving Angle about one months supply of the pill, which accounted to several hundred.

It was then Angie felt she had 'lost' her son.

'We are not blaming anyone, but we are looking for more autism services in the North so that other families don't have to go through this'Â  Ron Watson said.

'This is devastating.'

Karen Johnston, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Children and Family Development, said the ministry cannot comment on the case for privacy reasons.

Single mom Angie Robinson, 40, left a suicide note saying she no longer felt able to look after her autistic son

The ministry provides $6,000 per year for families to assist with 'out-of-school intervention services' for autistic children aged six to 18.

Inclusion B.C. executive director Faith Bodnar said the ministry significantly reduced funds available to families with autistic children several years ago, and in isolated communities 'accesses to resources can be much more limited'.

'I think, unfortunately, this tragic event speaks for itself,' Bodnar said.

'People don't do these things if they are well supported. This family was alone, marginalized and not taken care of by the MCFD.'
