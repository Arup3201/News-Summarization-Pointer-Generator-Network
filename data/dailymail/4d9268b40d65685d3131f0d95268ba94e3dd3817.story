To hell with moral victories, heroic near-misses and statistical consolations. England confront the All Blacks again with twin targets — victory and history. That is all. Nothing else will do.

A week on from an agonising Auckland demise, England find themselves at a seminal moment in their crusade to re-emerge as a global force.

Their time has come. They are no longer hampered by fixture congestion, or the absence of several injured men.

They are no longer afflicted by the age-old English curse of being beaten before they start in these parts.

The crunch: Marland Yarde and Kieran
Brookes collide in training ahead of the Auckland Test

The box kick

Stuart Lancaster is ready to unleash a line-up as potent as any under his regime and his side are utterly bereft of fear in the face of the world champions.

There were no excuses last Saturday following the 20-15 defeat at Eden Park, but the backdrop of disruption meant that a defeat was widely acclaimed as a triumph of sorts.

Asked if another heroic defeat would suffice, flanker Tom Wood said: ‘No. While we were proud of the effort and performance last week, we will never accept losing, regardless of the opposition. We go into every game intending and fully expecting to win.’

Considering the doomsday scenario of another shattering loss, he added: ‘It will be difficult and the pressure will begin to mount. We certainly didn’t come here to lose any games, never mind two on the bounce and be staring down the barrel of three losses. It certainly focuses the mind. We’ll concentrate on levelling the score.’

England know that what matters in this crucial second Test is finishing ahead on the scoreboard, whatever it takes. 

The big push: England will be desperate to level the series against New Zealand

The cross-field kick

There is a bigger picture, the need to build a game-plan capable of delivering World Cup glory, but the priority for now is managing to claim rugby’s most prized scalp in hostile territory.

Success would be a giant stride forward. Five times England have played the All Blacks on New Zealand’s South Island and five times they have lost — in 1963, 1985, 1998, 2004 and 2008. Twice this city has staged this fixture and the visitors have conceded a century of points, scoring a paltry 25 in response. England have a 100 per cent record at the Forsyth Barr Stadium, but their opponents there — at the last World Cup — were Argentina, Georgia and Romania.

English ambition has too often amounted to merely seeking respectability in the face of Kiwi supremacy, but that inferiority complex has been shattered. Lancaster’s side do not bend the knee at the first sign of those fabled shirts. Three times they have played these opponents since Lancaster took over in 2012 and the current aggregate score is 75-71 in England’s favour.

In the aftermath of the opening skirmish in Auckland, there has been ample focus on various areas of English dominance:scrum and line-out, territory, possession — the old staples — along with line-breaks, metres made, defenders beaten and so on. In a nutshell, they played well but lost.

It can’t happen again if their advance is to continue apace. The All Blacks are coming into this Test with contrasting priorities. They had the result last weekend, but fell a long way below the standards they have come to expect in winning all but one Test since claiming the home World Cup in 2011.

The counter attack

Steve Hansen, the hosts’ head coach, anticipates a reaction from his players.

‘We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact we did win the Test, but at the same time we weren’t proud of our performance,’ he said. ‘This sets up brilliantly the second instalment of what could be a rivalry that endures all the way to next year’s World Cup final.’

England must hope their contingent of Premiership finalists swiftly reintegrate to guard against the threat of a damaging loss of cohesion. Theoretically, they will be improved by Danny Care’s spark at scrum-half and the combative authority of Owen Farrell at No 10, while the glass-half-full vision involves Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell creating a platform to unleash the redeployed Manu Tuilagi out wide or on in-field forays.

Up front, Chris Robshaw, Wood and Co will need to make a collective effort to smash Richie McCaw out of his poaching routine at the rucks. If they do so, Ben Morgan blasts forward with the same ball-carrying clout he did last week and the Geoff Parling-Rob Webber axis delivers another line-out masterclass, England will have a chance. More so if their defensive line-speed hurries the Kiwis into another torrent of errors.

It may come down to the impact of the replacements, which is when Lancaster will relish being able to send on the likes of Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes and Billy Vunipola. Having such pedigree and firepower to add second-half impetus could swing the contest England’s way.

The majority of those in attendance under the stadium roof will expect the perfect conditions and the jolt to the system delivered seven days earlier to ensure a night of Black magic and the resumption of normal service.

But maybe, just maybe, they will be condemned to watching Lancaster’s rising side seize their victory and history.
