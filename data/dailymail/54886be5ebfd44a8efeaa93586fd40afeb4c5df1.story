A dating expert spent the day posing as a damsel in distress in a bid to find out if men are more likely to approach a woman because of the way she is dressed.

Hayley Quinn donned three very different outfits to play the part of a lost tourist outside of a busy London tube station for the social experiment titled 'Does changing the clothes change the woman?'

The London-based dating professional tested the relationship between what a woman wears, and whether that alters the likelihood of her being approached by a possible suitor.

Hayley conducted the social experiment to show how men alter their reaction to women based on appearance 

The 27-year-old changed from an everyday outfit of leggings, a low-cut t shirt and leather jacket, into a casual hoody and trainers combo, then a more sexy tight dress.

The video shows that Hayley had the most success when she changed into a sexy, tight-fitting bodycon dress, knee length 'stripper heels' and a leather jacket.

The least 'sexy' of the outfits was the casual hoody, t-shirt and trainers combination

Hayley noted the speed at which men approached her was much higher in her 'stripper heels' outfit 

Hayley, who says she has helped more than 100,000 men find love, said: 'There were a lot of interesting differences between the three outfits.

'I didn't necessarily get approached by more men while I was wearing the sex kitten outfit with the stripper heels. I would say I was helped out just as much

'But guys definitely checked me out more in that outfit, it was more blatant.

'And one thing that I did notice was that the speed at which I was approached was much higher - a guy nearly killed himself on a bike stopping to help me.

 The relationship expert points out that men actually approach women fairly infrequently over all 

Hayley found that she overall was offered help a similar number of times no matter what she was wearing 

The brave dating expert points out that men shouldn't think good looking women are approached 'all the time'

'That was the longest interaction I got during the whole day, and when I wore the hoody and trainers I had the shortest interaction.

'So the length of time guys spend interacting with a woman definitely seems to increase the hotter the girl looks.

'Overall though it seems like men just aren't approaching women. But this just shows that if men are thinking 'she must get approached all the time' - no she doesn't, so if you can be the guy that does that then hallelujah.'
