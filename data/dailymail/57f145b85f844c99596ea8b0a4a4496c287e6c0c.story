Russia and other major powers agreed to back plans by UN envoy Kofi Annan to end the bloodshed in Syria by forming a national unity government.

The interim cabinet that could include government and opposition members but would exclude those whose participation would undermine it, according to diplomats.

Annan's proposal for a political transition aimed at ending the 16-month conflict in Syria is one of the main topics that Russia, the other four permanent Security Council members and key players in the Middle East will discuss at a meeting in Geneva on Saturday, sources close to discussions said.

One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, summarized Annan's proposal, saying the Syria conflict can only end when all sides see a peaceful way to a shared future.

The potential breakthrough came as Turkey moved military hardware to the border after one of its plains was shot down.

Annan made clear it was 'vital that any settlement be irreversible, with clear transition steps in fixed timeline,' he said.

'These include establishing a transitional national unity government to create a neutral backdrop for transition,' the diplomat said in his summary of Annan's plan.

'It could comprise present government members, opposition and others, but would need to exclude those whose continued participation or presence would jeopardize the transition's credibility, or harm prospects for reconciliation and stability.'

The diplomat added that the idea of excluding certain people was clearly referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, though Annan's proposal does not explicitly say Assad could not serve in a national unity government. That gives Russia the option of insisting that Assad be allowed to stay in power.

'The Russians signalled to Annan that they accept his transition plan,' he said. Several Western diplomats confirmed his remarks, adding that all five permanent veto-wielding U.N. Security Council members backed it.

Another diplomat said Russia's acceptance of Annan's proposal, which he circulated to the five permanent Security Council members this week, did not mean it has abandoned Assad.

'I'm very sceptical,' he said. 'I don't see the Russians giving up on Assad.'

The Russian mission at the United Nations was not available for comment.

Annan made acceptance of his guidelines for a political transition for Syria a condition for organising Saturday's meeting, which will include the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China, Turkey, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. It will not include Iran or Saudi Arabia.

Russia has repeatedly said its supports Annan's idea of creating a 'contact group' of powerful nations and regional players with influence on the Syrian government or the opposition to push for an end to the violence in Syria.

Several diplomats said Russia's acceptance of Annan's proposal appeared to signal a shift in its stance on Syria. But it was not immediately clear if Moscow's support for the idea of a national unity government in principle meant that it was now abandoning Assad, a staunch ally and key Russian arms purchaser.

The U.S., Britain and France have said that Assad is responsible for the violence, which the United Nations estimates has killed at least 10,000 people, is no longer fit to govern. Russia and China, however, reject what they describe as Western calls for 'regime change.'

Russia has repeatedly said it is not insisting that Assad must remain in power at all costs, but that any decision on whether or not he should step down should come from the Syrian people, not from outside pressure or military intervention, as happened last year in Libya.

Saturday's meeting, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will attend, will have to agree on the details of the political transition and the mechanisms for implementing it, diplomats said.

Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, also wants Saturday's meeting to revive his moribund six-point peace plan that has failed to end the fighting between Assad's forces and an increasingly militarized opposition. The conflict has escalated in recent weeks.

Annan said the aim of the one-day talks was to identify measures to secure full implementation of his stalled peace plan and Security Council resolutions, including an immediate halt to all violence.

The support for Annan's plans came after a convoy of around 30 military vehicles, including trucks loaded with missile batteries, arrived in Turkey's coastal town of Iskenderun and deployed near the Syrian border 50 km (30 miles) away, Turkish agencies said.

Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, who has given shelter in the border area to rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, announced after Syrian air defences shot down a Turkish warplane last Friday he would step up security there.

Turkish television film showed the column moving off on Wednesday, escorted by police cars, along a narrow highway leading out of the main port of Turkey's Hatay province. It included rocket launchers on transporters, anti-aircraft artillery and military ambulances.

Erdogan said any military element moving towards the Turkish border and deemed threatening would be declared a military target. The preponderance of air defence weapons in the convoy suggested Turkey was preparing for any possible approach by Syrian helicopters or warplanes.

State-run Anatolia news agency said armoured military vehicles were being transported to military installations in Sanliurfa, in the middle of Turkey's border with Syria and Hatay, a panhandle province that juts down into Syria.

It said several military vehicles had travelled separately to a military garrison in the border town of Reyhanli in Hatay.

There have been no details given of new rules of engagement issued to troops after the shooting down of the warplane which Turkey says was in international air space.

The Hatay region is sheltering over 33,000 refugees as well as elements of the rebel Free Syrian Army.
