Bullied? Friends of Lewis Edge (pictured), who fell to his death from a bridge in Widnes, suggested he had been victimised

A teenager who fell to his death from a bridge may have been the victim of bullies, it emerged today.

Police believe Lewis Edge, 13, plunged 80 feet into the River Mersey from the Runcorn Bridge in Cheshire.

His body was found in the water just 400 yards from his Widnes home, which lies close to the crossing, after being reported missing on Wednesday.

As members of his family come to terms with his death, allegations have emerged that he may have been the victim of bullying.

Among tributes left for Lewis on Twitter, Charlie Pavitt said: 'RIP Lewis. Bullies these days are getting worse.'

Another, called Bethanyyy, tweeted: 'Rip lewis edge, bullying must stop! Forever in everyones hearts,?Â£gbnf!'

Googly Bear posted: 'RIP Lewis Edge, you'll never be forgotten.'

Lewis, who was sometimes known by the surname Millward, was spotted by a passer-by floating in the River Mersey off the coast of the West Bank area of Widnes at 8am this morning.

Police and paramedics responded to the alert, but his lifeless body was pulled from the water and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

His death is being treated as 'unexplained', but early reports indicate he may have fallen more than 100 yards from a footpath on the Runcorn 'Silver Jubilee Bridge'.

The distinctive arch-span bridge links Widnes with Runcorn and the spot where his body was recovered is near the entrance to the Sankey Canal.

Forensic teams were continuing their investigation at the scene and the footpath over the bridge was closed to the public.

Family liaison officers were comforting Lewis's distraught mother Lisa at the home she shares with partner, Graeme Edge, in Mersey Road.

A Facebook group 'RIP Lewis Edge, Gone But Never Forgotton' was set up this afternoon and already has 123 members.

One of his closest friends, Regan Moss, said keen guitar player Lewis 'kept yourself to yourself and I really admired that'.

Regan's post on the wall of the social networking site said: 'R.I.P Lewis! Best friends through primary school ;/ Fell out in high school but will never forget you :)..

'Brilliant at guitar and really funny, kept yourself to yourself and i admired that. There wasn't a fault with you. Just the people who had a problem with you had the faults!

'Thoughts are with you and your in a better place. Somewhere where there is no fights, no violence, no arguing just peace :) Hope your happy with the angels and i hope your having some good dreams :) Sleep tight and see you someday! God bless :(!'

Millii Kilshaw said: 'Forever young Lewis don't forget me cause I'll never forget you, sweet dreams angel.'

Matty Clawson said: 'Not going to be the same without him. Rest in Peace Lewis.'

Tom Murray said: 'R.I.P mate your were a very good friend and you will be very missed :'('

A Cheshire Constabulary spokesperson said: 'Police and other emergency services are responding to a report of a body found at around 8am today.

'Police remain at the scene and there are road closures in place at Terrace Road and Mersey Road.'

Lewis was a pupil at Wade Deacon secondary school in Widnes, which has declined to comment.

A Home Office post mortem will be conducted in due course and HM Coroner has been informed.
