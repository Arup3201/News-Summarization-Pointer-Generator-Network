Murder charge: Terry Lee Black, 41, was arrested over the killing of his six-year-old neighbor Sierra who was raped and drowned

A man has been arrested after he stole a six-year-old girl from her bed in the middle of the night, raped and murdered her, authorities said.

Sierra Newbold, six, disappeared from her home on June 26 before her body was found in a nearby canal later that day.

Her next-door neighbor Terry Lee Black, 41, has been charged with aggravated murder, kidnapping and rape, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said today.

The child was last seen by her mother at 10.30pm at their home in West Jordan, Utah.

On the morning of June 26, Mrs Newbold told police she noticed a sliding glass door in the family's home was open and the girl wasn't in her bed.

Authorities mounted a search and found the girl's pink pajamas and undergarments in a field a short distance away from the home.

Her body was found floating face down in a canal one hour later.

An autopsy revealed the girl was sexually assaulted and strangled but the official cause of death was drowning.

Black was arrested on June 29 on suspicion of car theft and bank robbery.

Police officers then noticed Black lived in an apartment near the canal where the six-year-old's body was found, and that debris on his clothing appeared similar to debris found in the field where the clothing was discovered.

Mr Gil said Newbold's DNA was then found on Black's body. He was held today on $2 million bond. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.

Child's life: Sierra was described by family as outgoing, eager to make friends, and a young girl who loved to dance and draw

Officials revealed last month that a 
surveillance camera at the Newbolds' house in West Jordan captured 
images from around the time of Sierra's disappearance on Tuesday 
morning. They believed that the man who abducted her was in this 
footage.

Officers found Sierra’s body in the canal about a block from her home, just 30 minutes after her mother 'discovered she was not there and called us,' police Sgt. Drew Sanders said.

The girl's dad had left for work some
time before her absence was noticed but her mother. Her younger sister and 
elder brother were also at home.

An announcement for the child's 
funeral last month described the child as quick to make
friends while outgoing and a member of her local soccer team.

'She was eager to grow up, drive, and get her “very own” cell phone. She 
loved to draw and was an incredible artist at a very young age. She 
loved dancing, hiking, and being active. She loved life and lived it to 
the fullest,' it read.

'She had the amazing ability to make everyone happy with her 
big brown eyes and her beautiful smile.'
