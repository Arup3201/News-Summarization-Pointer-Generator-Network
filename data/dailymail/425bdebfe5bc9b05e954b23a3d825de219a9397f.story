Gloucester have announced a contract extension for England international flanker Matt Kvesic.

The 22-year-old, who won two caps on England's tour of Argentina last year, joined Gloucester from Worcester in 2013.

'I am very pleased that Matt has committed his future to the club,' Gloucester Rugby director David Humphreys said.

'His desire to remain with Gloucester and be part of what we are building here speaks volumes about where we are headed.

'Matt's a quality player, a young talented individual who will be a very important part of our squad going forward.

'He is the first to put pen to paper, but I am confident that he won't be the last in the next few weeks.'

Kvesic added: 'I'm really happy to have things sorted out, and to have got it out of the way so early. I'm enjoying my rugby massively at the moment, and I think everyone can see the progress that we're making as a team.

'It's a great club, on and off the field. We play at a great stadium in front of fantastic fans. Agreeing to stay was a very easy decision.

'The last few months have seen the club starting to put everything in place for Gloucester to be successful going forward. It's all starting to come together, and I'm really looking forward to playing my part.'
