Just a few weeks ago 75-year-old Mr Saru, crematorium operator in the tiny village of Kaliori in central Java, Indonesia had his 'kolumbarium' swarming overnight with 50 police.

As officers guarded the entrance, the veteran of the Giri Laya Krematorium and his wife went about their business.

A group of 'special guests' gathered in the white-tiled auditorium adjoining the primitive ovens which Mr Saru employs to effectively cremate the dead.

The reason for the high security in the early hours of January 18 was that two men who had just been executed on Nusakambangan Island off the southern coast of Java had wished to be cremated.

Their remains were ferried by ambulance under police escort to Giri Laya and handed over to Mr Saru while the men's relatives assembled for a Christian ceremony to honour their loved ones.

After a six hour process - three hours in the furnace and three cooling down - Mr Saru opened the heavy doors of his two ovens and gently swept out the ashes for two terracotta urns.

After finishing their job, Mr and Mrs Saru went back to their home to rest.

75-year-old Mr Saru and his wife are the guardsmen of the Giri Laya crematorium in Indonesia 

It takes Mr Saru three hours to burn a body in a wooden coffin and another three hours to let the ashes cool before they are removed

The bereaved aunt and wife of the two condemned men took their urns and prepared for the final journey of their nephew and husband, after long years on death row in Indonesian prisons, home.

Indonesia's death penalty and the country's attitude to death and capital punishment, has been brought into high relief by a round of six executions in central Java, and a further pending 11.

Mr Saru happily opens the doors to his facilities as public protests and legal battles continued against the scheduled executions of four Indonesians, a Philippino woman, a French, Ghanian, Nigerian and Brazilian men and the two Australian Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

Heavy roller beds on mini railway tracks transport the remains into each furnace, which are then closed off by a brick door weighing 1,000kg and sealed with wet dirt

These are the tools Mr Saru uses to collect the ashes of the dead. Prisoners who are executed on Nusakambangan are taken to his crematorium 

While Indonesian television has broadcast detailed recreations of the Indonesian method of execution by a highly trained paramilitary mobile unit armed with sophisticated weaponry, much of Mr Saru's equipment for disposing of remains seemed steeped in centuries past.

The Giri Laya Krematorium lives up a dusty lane from the village in southwestern central Java's Banyumas province, one hour's drive north of the port to Nusakambangan island.

From the outside it looks like an old primary school with peeling painted concrete and an open sided area for waiting relatives.

The two chambers use a diesel generated engine to burn the bodies

This is the view from Giri Laya crematorium. Mr Suru does not know when the guards from Nusakambangan will come knocking on his door again

The two furnaces lie behind a wall of tiles and steel mesh with a sign that reads in Bahas Indonesia 'Daycare Ashes (Kolumbarium).

Heavy roller beds on mini railway tracks transport the remains into each furnace, which are then closed off by a brick door weighing 1000kg and sealed with wet dirt.

The ovens are fuelled by diesel oil piped into the back from 50 gallon drums.

These are the tools Mr Suru uses to collect the ashes from the chamber

Mr Suru transports the ashed to this urn when they are cooled and ready

He said he had not been informed when he might again be greeting police officers and relatives up from Nusakambangan in the middle of the night

These are the two burning chambers as Giri Laya crematorium. Bodies transported into the chambers on the bricks and then rolled into the crematorium

Mr Saru displayed the tools of his trade which helped him gather the ash from the roller bed after the process to collect the remains, and cheerfully discussed the intricacies of his business.

He said he had not been informed when he might again be greeting police officers and relatives up from Nusakambangan in the middle of the night.
