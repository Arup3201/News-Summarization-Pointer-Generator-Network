Like Ascot, Henley Regatta comes with a strict dress code. But on the second day of the 175th regatta, rowing enthusiasts showed that there’s lots of ways to look good and appropriate on the riverside.

With ladies required to wear dresses or skirts with a hemline below the knee, and strictly no trousers allowed, there were calf-length frocks by the dozen on displays as guests enjoyed the sunshine.

Keeping on trend, lots of women went for printed dresses, accessorising with plain jackets and hats.

Feeling flowery: Keeping on trend, lots of women opted for flower-printed dresses in a midi-length

With both designer and High Street shops overflowing with all things flowery, flower-printed dresses were a popular choice, in a bright array of different shades.

Though hats aren’t compulsory at Henley, most women sported hats to complete the feeling of regatta chic.

Unlike at Ascot or the Queen’s Garden Party there was hardly a fascinator in sight, with most ladies wearing big shady sunhats to help keep cool and avoid unsightly back-of-the-neck sunburn as they watched the rowers strut their stuff.

Hats off to you! These women kept the flowery trend going with their flower and feather adorned hats

With stilettos likely prove somewhat unpractical when you're going for a stroll along the riverbank, most guests wore wedges or  thick-heeled shoes to save from sinking into the grass.

As well as the brightly coloured prints, white was a popular choice, with on-trend lacey dresses making a big impact.

Some women jumped on the blazer band-wagon to finish off their outfits, however the hot weather meant that most went for sleeveless and strapless dresses.

As well as those in the official enclosure, each year Henley also attracts a younger crowd of fans who today enjoyed sunbathing on the banks of the Thames.

Flowered prints were a popular choice here too, although they’d clearly missed the memo about not flashing too much flesh.

But while women mostly stuck to blues, greens and reds, the men of Henley came out in a full-force pink parade today, with pink trousers spanning as far as the eye could see.

Pink power: Brightly coloured trousers were a popular choice for the men of Henley, ranging in shades from pastel to eye-popping hot pink

Pretty in Pink: Two young men opt for co-ordinating trousers - but at least they didn't wear matching blazers too

While the pink-trouser trend is usually only popular with upper-class school and university lads, men of all ages were getting involved, providing an eye-popping scene.
