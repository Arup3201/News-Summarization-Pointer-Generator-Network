Kyle Walker has admitted he is a clean freak, who drives his girlfriend crazy, and is addicted to collecting trainers.

The Tottenham full-back returns to Roy Hodgson's England fold for the first time this week since his nine-month injury nightmare.

Walker, 24, last played for the Three Lions in November 2013 in the 1-0 defeat at Wembley by Germany.

An abdominal problem forced him to painfully miss last summer's World Cup in Brazil.

But having returned to action last December for Spurs, Walker is buzzing to be back as he pushes for a start in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

'I have had a lot of tests in my career so far,' said Walker, who has been capped 10-times for his country to date.

'I think obviously being injured and missing the World Cup was tough. Not being able to play for my country in Brazil was a big kick in the teeth.

'In football you're going to have a lot of ups and downs, but you need to stay mentally strong and you need to stay focused. You need to know you're a professional and you've got a job to do.

'It’s not a one-man game. It's 10 other players on the pitch that everyone must rely on to get the three points you’re striving for throughout the week.'

Away from the pitch, the former Sheffield United right-back revealed he enjoys playing golf with his mates.

But it is rather is obsession for cleanliness that drives his model girlfriend Annie Kilner crazy.

'I like things to be clean,' he said, speaking to a Nike Q&A as part of the American brand's launch of Air Max Day.

'I don't like mess. My missus will probably tell you that I drive her insane with all my cleanliness.

'It’s probably why I've got 20 packs of baby wipes in a cupboard down there just so when I come into my sneaker closet, I can keep them clean and fresh.'

Walker blames his other obsession - trainers - on his Mum, however.

'I've always had a trainer fetish,' he added.

It was flip-flops, not trainers, when Walker and Annie holidayed in Barbados in summer 2013

And the couple hit the sea on a jet ski during the same holiday

Despite England's woeful performance, Walker says missing the 2014 World Cup was 'a kick in the teeth'

'That's just my thing. I think I caught it from my mum, because I know my mum does like shoes. So I think I've caught it off her, but I think I've kind of overtook her now, definitely.

'How many pairs have I got? Oh, I don't know. I couldn't tell you. Maybe 150 or so.

'I know I've got some in the garage that I still haven't unpacked, because obviously I've just moved to this new house. So I'd say I've got quite a bit. And you know what? I think mum has actually got a full bedroom of them at home.'

Now he is fit and firing again, Walker will be hoping to collect a bedroom full of England caps too.
