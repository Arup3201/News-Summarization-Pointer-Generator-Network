Police officers have been told to stay away from the internet after drinking alcohol when off-duty – to avoid giving away secrets or embarrassing their force.

They have been instructed to use private chat rooms if they want to complain about their jobs, rather than log on to public websites such as Facebook and Twitter where their comments could ‘go viral’ and be seen by thousands of people.

Officers must not post details of their jobs, pictures of themselves in uniform or details of their hobbies.

And they are urged to keep an eye  on what members of their families  are posting too. The recommendations could lead to hundreds of officers editing their profiles.

The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) says that police risk breaching trust, leaking personal data, discrediting the service, giving away personal details and jeopardising operations if they fail to use the internet safely. Its ten-page guide is published as growing numbers of officers find themselves in trouble over their online activity.

A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary found 357 instances of ‘potentially inappropriate behaviour’ among 1,588 officers active on social media sites, mainly Twitter.

The posts included offensive language (132 instances); comments on police procedures (119); negativity towards work (70) and ‘extreme opinions on [the] Government’ (36).

A Metropolitan Police constable, James Patrick, is facing gross misconduct proceedings over comments he made on Twitter and in a book about police reform and service cuts. And a Greater Manchester officer, Andy Hall, quit the site after being given ‘advice’ by senior colleagues about his light-hearted tweets. In one message, he listed the high price of chocolate bars as a ‘crime update’.

Northamptonshire Police deleted the Twitter accounts of four officers last year amid concerns they had wrongly discussed investigations or breached data protection law.

The new ACPO guidance warns: ‘Police officers and staff should avoid using the internet and social media off-duty after consuming alcohol or when their judgment may be impaired for other reasons.’

It urges police not to use social media while on duty or on personal smartphones. Officers are warned to be careful when adding new friends to social media profiles; to ensure their privacy settings are at the highest level; and to remember that online users may not be who they appear to be.

John Cooper QC, who will represent PC Patrick, said: ‘As with all guidelines relating to social media, these smack of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. One wonders why, for example, the police have to be advised not to tweet when drunk.’
