Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned on Wednesday that the Islamic State is far more dangerous than previous terrorist groups, including the one that led the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11.

'It’s a serious threat because this is the best-funded, most professional, expansionist jihadist military force that we have ever seen,' Clinton told the Economic Club of Chicago, according to the Washington Post.

'This is far more advanced and far richer than al Qaeda ever was,' Clinton declared.

The former U.S. official's claim follows an admission from President Barack Obama last week that intelligence officials 'underestimated' ISIS' rapid accession in Iraq and 'overestimated' the Middle Eastern country's ability to fight off the extremist group. 

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks at the Economic Club of Chicago  on Wednesday. Clinton told attendees the Islamic State is far more dangerous than previous terrorist groups,

Just last January the president himself blew the terrorist group off as 'jayvee' level threat.

'I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian,' he asserted.

Nine months later, ISIS has taken key areas of Iraq, and large portions of Syria. It has also beheaded two Americans and threatened to kill more if the U.S. continues to intervene in Iraq.

The extremist group has stepped up its efforts to assume control of Syria in recent days, making a crippling assault on the city of Kobani.

A spokesman for the Pentagon admitted to reporters on Wednesday that the U.S. airstrikes 'are not going to save' the Syrian city from succumbing to the terrorist group.

'We've been very honest about the limits of air power here. The ground forces that matter the most are indigenous ground forces, and we don't have a willing, capable, effective partner on the ground inside Syria right now -- it's just a fact,' Rear Adm. John Kirby proclaimed, according to CNN.

Both Kirby and current Secretary of State John Kerry argued on Wednesday that protecting Kobani isn't critical to the United States' long term goal of weakening and ultimately causing the collapse of ISIS.

Meanwhile, Obama administration officials sought to quell concerns this week that ISIS may be in the midst of taking its fight to a third country: the United States.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services, told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren this week that he has knowledge that 'at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.'

'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.' 

The Department of Homeland Security rushed to discredit the Republican congressman's claims on Wednesday.

'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement.

Homeland Security head Jeh Johnson has said multiple times, including in testimony before Congress, that no ISIS affiliates have been detained while trying to infiltrate the U.S. through it's border with Mexico.

In the agency's statement on Wednesday, it reassured Americans that 'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.' 

Top government officials have not denied that the Islamic State could attempt an attack on the U.S.

While acknowledging that the U.S. has no intelligence that ISIS is involved in 'specific plotting against our homeland,' President Obama suggested last month that Americans abroad who have ties to ISIS could try to return and attack the homeland.

'I know many Americans are concerned about these threats,' he said. 'I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve.'

On Wednesday the New York Times reported that the Justice Department had taken into custody 10 individuals this year attempting to leave the country to join ISIS ranks. If allowed to depart, the detainees could potentially return to the U.S. one day and commit acts of jihad, government officials have said.

Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she believes ISIS 'will attempt to launch attacks against Western targets if it has the ability to do so.'

The presumed 2016 presidential candidate forecast 'some kind of legislative action' from Congress when it returns from recess that would give President Obama the necessary authorization to engage ISIS militarily.

Congress excused itself last month for an extended break ahead of the midterm elections. It's not scheduled to reconvene until the second week in November.
