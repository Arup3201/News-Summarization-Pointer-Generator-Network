Be mine: Banksy image of two policemen kissing used to promote the Valentine's weekend fixture against the Met Police

Think non-league football is the preserve of nerdy, anorak-wearing obsessives? Think again... at least in East Sussex.

Lewes, who are in a battle to beat the drop in the Ryman Isthmian League Premier Division - the seventh tier of the English football, are using eye-catching posters with iconic 
images to promote games.

The posters, which are quite frankly brilliant, use imagery inspired by films like the Magnificent Seven, album covers from the Sex Pistols and Pink Flloyd, street art from Banksy... and even Soviet wartime 
propaganda... proving football really is an art form.

The posters, put up throughout the East Sussex town on matchdays, have become a cult hit with supporters.

Attendances at the Ryman Premier 
League club's Dripping Pan ground used to be an average 433, but it has 
risen to about 600 since the club officials came up with the idea.

A smattering of celebrity fans has also helped raise the club's profile.

Dave Lamb, the voiceover star of hit TV show Come Dine With Me, is the club's former chairman and a regular on terraces.

Comedian Patrick Marber (of Alan Partridge and The Day Today fame) is one of the founder 
members of the Rooks’ community ownership board – as such, the club 
count the likes of Charles Saatchi, Lawson and Coogan as 
shareholders.

Club
director Charlie Dobres told the Independent: 'This is a small town of 
16,000 people but is so bonkers and pro-active it's just the kind of 
place to do this sort of thing.'

Dobres was
one of six founders of the Rook 125 group which saved the club from 
going bust three years ago and turned it into a Barcelona-style club 
owned by fans.

Nicknamed 'The Rooks', Lewes have played 
at The Dripping Pan – a 3,000-capacity (though only 600 seater) former 
cricket ground – since their inception in 1885 and, since 2010, have 
been a member-owned football club.

Mr Dobres added: 'We wanted to return the club to its community roots. We wanted the posters to be an expression of that.

'They
evolved to a theme that fits us, the town and the club which is 
deliberately irreverent and plugged into the multicultural media.'

The club, battling against the threat of relegation, has played at the Dripping Pan since 1885 and has a capacity of 3000.

Each poster, produced by the Brighton design firm 
East Web, draws on a number of cultural references, including the Sex Pistols.

Against the Met Police on Valentine's Day last month, the match poster showed the Banksy image of two policemen kissing.

For the game against Canvey Island on
Mother's Day this Sunday, the club have used a image from World War Two
of Russia urging its people to be proud of the motherland.
