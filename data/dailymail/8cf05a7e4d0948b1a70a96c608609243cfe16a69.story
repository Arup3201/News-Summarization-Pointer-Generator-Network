One boy can be heard screaming: 'Yo, beat the s*** out of him!'

Target: Kaleb Kula, 11, is seen standing alone waiting for the bus on mobile phone footage posted on Facebook

Brutal: A boy, who cannot be identified, punches Kaleb , who has autism, directly in the face while other students cheer him on in Maryland

Violent: As Kaleb turns away after being struck in the head, his attacker grabs him from behind

The incident in Elkton, Maryland, was filmed on a mobile phone by another pupil and then uploaded to a Facebook page.

It was viewed dozens of times before Kaleb's parents became aware of its existence.

In an interview with  local station WMAR-TV, they  claimed that the sixth grader, who suffers from a form of autism 
along with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, has endured years of bullying at Elkton Middle School.

His father, James Kula added: 'At least kids that don't have special needs can defend themselves a little bit more. He's pretty much defenceless.'

Mr
 Kula and his wife Jessica said they have contacted the school numerous 
times about the bullying but little has been done.

Last year, they were 
given a form to fill out to officially report their son was being attacked.

Distress: James and Jessica Kula said they have complained about the bullying to Elkton Middle School but little has been done to protect their son

Mrs Kula said: 'I just can't believe that kids can be so mean.'

Sitting
 with his parents, Kaleb Kula said he has been threatened and attacked 
for years at his school.

He told the station: 'They call me homosexual. They try kicking me, pushing me, punching me and a lot of other things.'

Police have charged the boy who hit Kaleb as a juvenile with second degree assault.

School
 officials would not comment directly on the incident but said that 
there were procedures in place to prevent bullying and protect students.

The school said that bullies can be 
disciplined and parents of pupils were often brought to the school to 
discuss conflict between children.
