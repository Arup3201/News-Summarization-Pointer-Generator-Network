West Ham are preparing for up to a month without talisman Alex Song after Cameroon called him up for the Africa Cup of Nations.

The midfielder was not included in his country’s provisional squad for the tournament, which was announced last month, but has been brought in to replace the injured Stephane Mbia.

Song had fallen out of favour with the national team following his sending-off in the World Cup against Croatia and has not played for manager Volker Finke since. But the 27-year-old has been one of the top midfielders in the Premier League this season and Finke has brought him back ahead of Wednesday’s deadline for finalised squads.

Here are the West Ham matches that Alex Song will miss while at the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon

Jan 10 - Swansea (A) Premier League 

Jan 18 - Hull (H)  Premier League

Jan 24/25 - Possible FA Cup 4th round

If Cameroon reach the latter stages, Song will potentially miss:

Jan 31 - Liverpool (A) Premier league

Feb 8 - Man United (H) Premier League

This has forced West Ham manager Sam Allardyce to plan for life without Song for the duration of the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, which ends on February 8. It will come as a huge blow to the east London club as they chase a place in Europe. They are currently seventh in the table, four points behind fourth-placed Southampton.

West Ham, who face Everton in the FA Cup third round tonight, are also losing Cheikhou Kouyate, who plays for Senegal, and he could be joined by top scorer Diafra Sakho if he recovers from a back problem.

Allardyce said: ‘We have a squad that’s available to play Everton less our Africa Cup of Nation players Song and Kouyate, and Sakho, who’s got a back injury.’

Song has been the driving force for West Ham since his loan move from Barcelona in the summer, but the club’s form in the first half of the season, which put them as high as third, is beginning to slide.

Song will miss tonight’s game at Everton and Premier League matches against Swansea, Hull and Liverpool. If Cameroon make it to the final he would also miss the clash with Manchester United and be doubtful for a trip to Southampton on February 11.

Allardyce is adamant that he will not lose Winston Reid for a minimal transfer fee this month — but conceded that the defender is set to leave in the summer.

Reid’s contract expires at the end of the season, meaning he is now free to sign terms with clubs outside of England ahead of a move in July. Unless English clubs agree a transfer fee with West Ham they are forbidden by FIFA regulations to speak to the player, but Allardyce is convinced some are making moves — via third parties — to secure his services.

Allardyce claimed: ‘If he’s not going to sign a contract then realistically I find it highly unlikely if it’s not already verbally done. Who knows? Only Winston and his agent can decide in the end. But it’s difficult to think he’s going to stay.

‘If you can prove that clubs have broken the rules then they’re in serious trouble aren’t they? But you can’t prove it. You just hear rumours of this, that and the other.

The midfielder, on loan from Barcelona, has been instrumental for the Hammers so far this campaign

‘It might have nothing to do with the two clubs directly, it could be between two agents. So how can you relate that to the clubs? You can’t, so it can all get done that way.’

West Ham opened talks with Reid over a new deal 12 months ago, during which time Allardyce says they have made ‘a million offers’.

But he believes the club can make more money by keeping Reid until the end of the season than selling him now. Allardyce said: ‘You have to balance it out, with £1.8m prizemoney per place, and look at the overall income you can get in, not just that you’re going to lose them for nothing in the summer.’
