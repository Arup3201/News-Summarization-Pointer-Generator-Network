to the stage at the Miss Sparkle and Shine pageant as her now famous alter ego Honey Boo Boo.

And when the six-fingered bundle of joy was brought into her patiently waiting arms, she was overcome with emotion.

'I love you, Kaitlyn,' she said of her new niece. 'Oh, she’s so soft! Kaitlyn is so cute and wrinkly. I love her.'

When Honey Boo's Boo's mother June looks at the thumb of her new granddaughter, she says: 'It’s better to have an extra thumb than no thumb at all.'

While Sugar Bear Mike, Honey Boo Boo's father, exclaims: 'That extra thumb reminds me of a Swiss Army knife.'

But it wasn't all smooth sailing for the Honey Boo Boo clan. As Anna went into labor, the family were preparing for the Beach Beauties in Brunswick pageant.

Baby Kaitlyn was finally coming, and the
 pageant would have to be missed.

In the delivery room, June put a 
camera in Anna's face, and in an effort to drive home the message that teenage 
pregnancy is not as magical as MTV's reality show Teen Mom makes it out to be, she asked Anna if she would recommend getting
 pregnant as a 17-year-old.

The in pain mother-to-be only whined: 'You do what you wanna do.'

inner sass.

The six-year-old quips: 'Ain’t nuthin’ wrong with being a little gay. Everybody’s a little gay'

For her Outfit of Choice, Alana 
donned a shiny blue swimsuit, which she said made her look like a 
blueberry.

Despite working over the
 crowd like a seasoned pro, she failed to place in the top three. However, she won the People's Choice Award, and she quickly forgets she has no crown on her head when her family surprises her with a brief reuniting with Glitzy, her pet pig.

The hour-long finale was by no means the end of Alana and her unpredictable family, however. TLC has already picked up additional episodes of the series, and fans can look forward to special Holiday installments around Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas.
