When most people think of Jesus, they don't typically think of grown men beating each other to a pulp. But for a collection of small Christian churches, mixed martial arts submission moves like the arm bar and the triangle choke hold are as integral a part of worshiping Christ as communion wine and Bible verses.  

A new documentary goes inside some of these churches and examines the relationship between MMA and Christianity by following a group of cage-fighting pastors who preach that a punch in the jaw is better than turning the other cheek.

'Weâ€™ll just be a couple of God-fearing men punching each other in the 
face,' one of the pastors explains in a trailer for the documentary, titled Fight 
Church.

Pastor/Cage fighter: Pastor Paul Burress says he and his parishioners  don't fight 'out of meanness'

Worship/workout: Many of the fighters train in the same building where they attend worship services

The film's website describes the congregations of these so-called 'Fight Club' churches as being 'made up of passionate, 
genuine people from all walks of the Christian faith who are trained and
 prepared to provide practical and spiritual care to fighters, coaches 
other members of the MMA community and their families.'

The film also features former UFC lightweight champion Benson 
Henderson and current UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, who each
 discuss how their faith plays a role in their fighting.

MMA pastor Paul Burress - of Victory Church in Rochester, New York - is featured in the film and defends the taboo practices of his church.

Love thy neighbor: The film poses the question of 'Can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can?'

Controversy: The documentary features children fighting other children, which has angered traditional Christians

'We
 donâ€™t fight out of meanness,' Burress told ABC News. 'We have no hate or bitterness in our heart.'

The documentary, directed by Oscar-winner Daniel Junge, raises a simple question: 'Can you love your neighbor as yourself and at the same time knee him in the face as hard as you can?'

Other pastors featured in the documentary defend the violence - which includes a young child pounding on another - as a part of Christianity.

'Jesus never tapped out,' says one of the pastors. 'He came to finish what he needed to do.'

'Love': A Catholic priest criticizes 'fight churches' saying there is 'no love' in violence - especially when children are involved, like the two pictured here

'Fight churches' have received mixed reviews from Christians. However, a more traditional priest interviewed for the documentary does not agree with the claims of 'Fight Church' pastors that violence is just an expression of love.

'John says love one another,' the priest says. 'This is not love.'
