On the day Mikel Arteta was made club captain at Arsenal Jack Wilshere provided the perfect answer to his critics while also responding to his manager Arsene Wenger's call to assume more responsibility at the club.

The 22-year-old has been heavily criticised since being caught on camera smoking on holiday in Las Vegas earlier this summer, but the England midfielder was quick to accept the consequences for his actions and drew a line over the incident.

Prior to Arsenal's 3-0 win over champions Manchester City in the Community Shield final at Wembley on Sunday, their second trophy in just four months, Wilshere demonstrated that he does care and can step up to the battle in the tunnel before the game.

Giroud was seen hanging around the dressing room in a world of his own before Wilshere told the French striker to hurry up and get outside as his team-mates were waiting for him inside the tunnel for their pre-match warm up.

This highlights that Wilshere is someone who isn't there to be carried by the older professionals at the club telling the main striker in the squad in no uncertain terms to hurry up and get outside.

Wilshere and his team-mates had a day to remember in the end as they cruised to a convincing win over Manuel Pellegrini's men, with the all-action midfielder impressing before being replaced by Mathieu Flamini on 68 minutes.

Wenger and Arsenal fans alike will be hoping for more of the same from Wilshere this season as he looks to prove his critics wrong and establish himself as one of the best players in the Premier League.
