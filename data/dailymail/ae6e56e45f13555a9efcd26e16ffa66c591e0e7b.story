The spies will wear disguises while giving evidence at the trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being behind a failed plot to bomb two Manchester shopping centres

British spies are to be allowed to don wigs and make-up in an attempt to conceal their identity during a trial of an alleged Al Qaeda operative, a judge ruled.

The six MI5 agents will wear disguises when they give evidence at the US trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being involved in an international conspiracy, targeting Manchester and New York.

US District Judge Raymond Dearie approved the unusual request in Brooklyn on Wednesday, after prosecutors explained the agents are still working undercover on sensitive cases,  arguing revealing their identities would 'pose a significant risk to their safety'.

The six undercover operatives were part of a team which conducted surveillance on Naseer, 28, while investigating a failed plot to bomb Manchester's Arndale and Trafford shopping centres in 2009.

They are all due to give evidence at the trial next month, and will be referred to by number rather than names.

The agents are also allowed to wear wigs and 'light make-up', as, papers filed by the prosecution said, 'neither of which will impair the defendant's or the jury's ability to view the witnesses' facial expressions and assess their credibility and demeanor'.

Naseer, a Pakistani national who came to the UK on a student visa, was extradited from the UK to New York in 2013, after a High Court judge ruled he 'poses a serious threat to the national security of the UK'. 

Two other witnesses expected to testify against Naseer — Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay — pleaded guilty in the thwarted plot to detonate homemade explosives in the subways.   

Prosecutors claim email show all three men were under the direction of the same Al Qaeda handler. 

They also say documents recovered during the bin Laden raid — now declassified — confirm the terror network's leadership was behind the conspiracy.

Naseer has decided to serve as his own attorney at the trial, expected to begin in the middle of February.
