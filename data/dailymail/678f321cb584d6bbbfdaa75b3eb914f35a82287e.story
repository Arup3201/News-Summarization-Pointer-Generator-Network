A Los Angeles school where one teacher is accused of feeding his semen to students and another allegedly abused two girls will close for two days.

The superintendent of the school district, John Deasy, will meet with worried parents of Miramonte Elementary School pupils on Monday night.

Classes at the school - where the two teachers allegedly abused children as young as six - will then be cancelled on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Schools spokesperson Monica Carzo was not certain what would be happening on campus over the two days or whether staff would be there.

Although classes are scheduled to go ahead as normal on Monday, some parents have already removed their children from the school.

The ruckus comes after teacher Mark Berndt, 61, was charged with carrying out lewd acts on 23 children who were aged six to 10.

He allegedly blindfolded
the students in his classroom and fed them his semen with a spoon. 
Children were allegedly told was a 'tasting game'.

The teacher, who had worked at the school for 32 years, allegedly carried out the acts between 2005 and 2010.

He has been jailed on $23 million bail and could face life behind bars if convicted.

Teacher Martin Springer, 49, was 
arrested on Friday - just four days later - on suspicion of fondling two
girls in his classroom. He is being held on $2 million bail.

The Los Angeles Times later revealed that the two teachers knew each other 
and had taken students on at least two joint field trips over the 
past decade.

One victim has come forward to speak about her ordeal.

The girl, who was in Mark Berndt’s 
second grade class in 2008, came home from school and showed her parents
a picture of her eating a cookie with a gleaming, light-coloured 
substance visible.

She was transferred to Martin Springer’s class, where her father alleges Springer touched her on her leg and thigh.

Her parents told the LA Times they had chosen to forget the alleged incidences 
until they saw Berndt had been charged.

The paper added that detectives 
have records that the girl transferred from one class to the next.

‘As a parent, it’s very painful. I don’t want to know much more,’ the father told the Times.

Detectives anticipate that more victims might come forward.

Detectives interviewed Springer and 
the alleged victims on Thursday and had him under surveillance.

He was pulled from a 
classroom at the school on Friday and arrested on 
suspicion of fondling two girls over a period of three years, an 
official said.

He will appear in court on Tuesday.

Just days earlier, third-grade teacher Berndt was accused of photographing blindfolded, bound and gagged 
children, some of whom had giant cockroaches sitting on their faces and 
mouths.

He was removed from his position a year ago after a film 
processor alerted police to the disturbing photos.

Springer was arrested based on information that came 
forward after the first arrest was announced, Sheriff's Capt. Mike 
Parker said, but there was no known connection between the two cases.

The victims in the second case were about seven-years-old and allegedly fondled in a classroom.

The number of complaints about teacher molestation has increased since news spread of the shocking allegations.

Parents have expressed fury that they
were not told about the horrifying photographs a year ago, when 
Berndt was removed from the school.

Authorities have also acknowledged that a 10-year-old girl claimed Berndt tried to fondle her as far back as 1994.

Prosecutors declined to file to charges against Berndt in the 1993 report, saying they didn't have enough evidence.

Classes were scheduled to go ahead as normal on Monday, but some parents said they planned to keep their children home.

Others immediately took their children out of school after Springer was arrested on Friday.

Parents told TV stations they would be holding a protest outside the school on Monday.

Parent Saul Ortiz told KTTV-TV he would out picketing the school.

'I want that guy dealt with,' Ortiz said of Berndt. 'The thought sickens you, it just sickens you inside.'

Ida Santana said her sister called her and told her to pick up her nephew after the arrest.

'It's hard to leave our kids here,' Santana said. 'We can't trust the teachers no more. Now there's another teacher.'
