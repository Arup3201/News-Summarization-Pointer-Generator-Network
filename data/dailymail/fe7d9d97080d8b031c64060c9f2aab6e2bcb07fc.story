A massive operation involving 30,000 members of the Iraqi military is succeeding in forcing Islamic State militants to withdraw from the strategic city of Tikrit, army generals have claimed.

Thousands of soldiers and government-backed Shi'ite militias already claim to have killed ISIS' second in command in the city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

The anti-ISIS advance has been slowed by numerous roadside bombs however, leading to fierce clashes outside the town of al-Dour, south of Tikrit.

Retaking the ISIS stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force ISIS out of the oil rich city of Mosul, the terror group's Iraqi power base which lies just 140 miles north of Tikrit on Highway 1 - a road that effectively marks the front line in northern Iraq.

Despite reports of local successes and the killing of ISIS' local second in command, officials in northern Iraq say troops are still clashing with jihadis south of Tikrit.

Roadside bombs, the officials claim, have slowed the offensive to retake the ISIS-held city.

The two local officials say fierce clashes are underway outside the town of al-Dour, south of Tikrit.

They say government forces backed by Shi'ite militias and Sunni tribal fighters have made little progress on the second day of a large-scale military operation to recapture Tikrit, which fell to the Islamic State group last summer. 

They say troops are shelling militant bases inside the city but their advance has been slowed by roadside bombs. The officials spoke anonymously as they are not authorized to brief media.

Iraqi warplanes and artillery began pounding Tikrit yesterday as 30,000 troops and irregulars prepared to attack the city.

The operation in the birthplace of former dictator Saddam Hussein was announced on Sunday by Iraq's prime minister, who urged soldiers and government-backed Shi'ite militias to spare civilians.

Speaking from Samarra, the other main city in Salaheddin province, Haider al-Abadi appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against Tikrit's mainly Sunni population. 

The Iraqi regime forces have yet to enter Tikrit or the nearby Tigris river town of al-Dour, which officials describe as a major centre for the Islamic State fighters.

On the southern flank of the offensive, army and police officials said government forces moving north from the city of Samarra could launch an attack on al-Dour later on Tuesday.

Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, who has helped coordinate Baghdad's counter-attacks against Islamic State since it seized much of northern Iraq in June, was overseeing at least part of the operation, witnesses told Reuters.

His presence on the frontline highlights neighbouring Iran's influence over the Shi'ite fighters who have been key to containing the militants in Iraq.

Accident: It is understood that the jihadi who carried out the attack detonated his device too early and accidentally killed several of his fellow militants. 58 ISIS fighters subsequently surrendered to the Iraqi army, while the bodies of at least 10 others were found nearby

In contrast the US-led air coalition which has been attacking Islamic State across Iraq and Syria has not yet played a role in Tikrit, the Pentagon said on Monday, perhaps in part because of the high-level Iranian presence. 

Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, was directing operations on the eastern flank from a village about 55 km (35 miles) from Tikrit called Albu Rayash, captured from Islamic State two days ago.

With him were two Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary leaders: the leader of the Hashid Shaabi, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandis, and Hadi al-Amiri who leads the Badr Organisation, a powerful Shi'ite militia.

As fighting continues to rage in and around Tikrit, a shocking video emerged showing an Islamic State suicide bomber launching a failed attack on an Iraqi military convoy.

The 52-second video, released on LiveLeak, shows a massive blast near the ISIS stronghold filmed from the back of a vehicle driven by regime forces.

So ferocious is the explosion that a thick black cloud of smoke is seen rising high in to the air, while debris litters the landscape for several hundred metres.

Tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for Iraqi forces battling Islamic State, but the attack by thousands of Shi'ite irregulars could severely test the government's ability to handle sectarian divisions.

Iraq is bitterly split between minority Sunnis, who were an important base of support for Saddam Hussein, despite his regime's nominal secularism, and the Shi'ite majority.

Since the Islamic State insurgency began, the Iraqi military is heavily dependent on Shi'ite militias that have been accused of abusing Sunni communities elsewhere in Iraq.

'The priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens,' Mr Abadi said last night.

Iraqi forces tried and failed several times to wrestle back Tikrit, a Sunni Arab city on the Tigris river around 100 miles north of Baghdad.

The military commander for Salaheddin province, Abdel Wahab Saadi, said Tikrit had both symbolic and strategic importance.

'The aim of course is to liberate Salaheddin to allow for the return of displaced families but it is also going to be a stepping stone on the way to liberating Mosul,' he told AFP.

Tikrit is the hometown of executed dictator Saddam Hussein, the remnants of whose Baath party have collaborated with IS in attempting to topple the Shi'ite-dominated government.

IS declared a 'caliphate' last June straddling Iraq and Syria, where the US-led coalition has also been conducting air strikes but not coordinating with any significant ground force.
