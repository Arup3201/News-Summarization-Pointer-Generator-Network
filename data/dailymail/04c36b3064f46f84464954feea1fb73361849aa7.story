Boeing has taken a major step forward in its bid to replace the space shuttle.

The aerospace giant has completed a key review of its design for a new commercial venture to fly astronauts to the International Space Station.

The firm is in a four way contest with SpaceX, privately held Sierra Nevada Corp, and Blue Origin,  Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos company, to develop and build U.S. commercial space taxis to transport astronauts rather than relying on Russia to ferry them to the station.

Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp.

That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia.

The multibillion-dollar program has taken on new urgency in recent months, given escalating tensions with Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.

Nasa spokeswoman Stephanie Martin said the U.S. space agency planned to choose one or more of the competitors to continue working on the program in late August or early September.

Martin confirmed that Boeing had completed a critical design review of its offering in the Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) program.

She said Nasa was reviewing the data to determine if Boeing met its required 'success criteria' for the review.

SpaceX and Sierra Nevada have sought and won extensions to finish their design reviews by May 2015.

Blue Origin, a privately funded company set up by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos is also vying for the work.

John Mulholland, vice president and program manager for Boeing's commercial space exploration programs, said the company faced some difficult challenges as it developed its design, but got 'excellent' feedback from Nasa during the review last month.

'From a technical standpoint, the review went very well,' he said.

'To the best of my knowledge we’re the only CCiCAP competitor that actually was able to complete all of the milestones in the period of performance,' he said.

The CST-100 spacecraft will at first be used to take astronauts to the ISS, pictured. However, Boeing also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as Bigelow Aerospace's inflatable habitats, which will be launched in the future

Mulholland said, measured in mass, the Boeing design for the cargo module was 96-percent complete at the time of the review, while its design for the crew module was 85-percent complete, two metrics that underscored the maturity of the design.

He said the critical design review marked a major step for the Boeing program.

'You've got to be able to stand up at that review and show the analysis and tests that demonstrate that you're going to be able to meet those requirements,' he said.

Boeing remains confident it could complete work on the new spacecraft in time to begin flight tests in 2017, Mulholland said.

He said Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp.

That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia.

He said the module was designed from the beginning to be compatible with other launch vehicles, if necessary, although that would still entail some modification of the interface between the spacecraft and the launcher.

Since the Space Shuttle was retired in July 2011, the US has relied on Russia to get its astronauts into orbit.

But through their Commercial Crew Program, Nasa has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft.

Boeing has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new Crew Space Transportation (CST-100) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years. The capsule is funded by Nasa as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft

Boeing’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the Crew Space Transportation (CST-100).

They unveiled the new commercial interior 
of its CST-100 next-generation manned space 
capsule, showing how people other than Nasa astronauts may one day 
travel to space.

This is the first time they have made the design of the interior public.

Boeing and partner Bigelow Aerospace highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for Nasa, while Bigelow showcased a full-scale model of its BA 330 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in.

'We are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential  customers - beyond Nasa - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior,' said Chris Ferguson, former Space Shuttle Atlantis commander and current Boeing director of Crew and Mission Operations for the Commercial Crew Program.

Engineers from across Boeing leveraged the company's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule's interior.

The capsule, interior view of a prototype pictured, will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit. It is in direct competition with SpaceX's manned Dragon capsule and Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane, all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space

'Boeing's teams have been designing award-winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation,' said Rachelle Ornan, regional director of Sales and Marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

'Designing the next-generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression. A familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with Earth.'

Three companies are currently receiving funding from Nasa to develop manned vehicles as part of the Commercial Crew Program.

The
 first is SpaceX, the company that seemingly came from nowhere a decade 
ago and has now flown the unmanned Dragon spacecraft to the ISS three 
times on its successful Falcon 9 series of rockets.

They
 are in the process of developing a manned version of the Dragon 
spacecraft (mockup pictured above) that can take a crew of seven into orbit, with rumours 
suggesting it may be unveiled this month with a view to launching its 
first crew as early as next year.

Boeing, meanwhile, with a rich heritage in space exploration is building the seven-seater CST-100 capsule.

And finally Sierra Nevada Corporation are constructing what some regard as the true successor to the Space Shuttle.

Known
 as the Dream Chaser (test vehicle pictured below), this ‘mini-shuttle’ of sorts will launch upright 
on top of a rocket, taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding 
back to Earth at the end of its mission.

With testing already underway, Dream Chaser is expected to undertake its first mission into space for the first time in 2017 on an Atlas V rocket.
