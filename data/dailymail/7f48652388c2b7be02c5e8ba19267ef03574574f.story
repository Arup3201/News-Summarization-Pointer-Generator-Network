Controversial footballer Joey Barton has exposed himself to ridicule by conducting an interview in English with a bizarre French accent.

Barton, 30, spoke for more than a minute in an accent reminiscent of 'Allo 'Allo! after making his loan league debut for Olympique de Marseille against Lille.

And he also insulted his host country by describing, in Franglais, French football as 'boring', saying: 'Maybe the one criticism of the French Ligue is it's a leetle bit boring'.

The QPR midfielder's toe-curling display did little to substantiate his previous claim that he was 'too intelligent to be a footballer'.

Gaffe: Joey Barton spoke in a French accent at the press conference after his league debut for Marseille

Seriously? Barton made a similar gaffe to former England manager Steve McClaren when he spoke in a faux Dutch accent

In the accented interview Barton said: 'For me it's important that people speak about the qualities I bring as a footballer.'

Barton's embarrassing display evoked memories of both 'Allo 'Allo!'s Officer Crabtree, and, in real life, the hilarious interview former England boss Steve McClaren gave in 2008 when he spoke English in a Dutch accent when managing Dutch side FC Twente.

Barton, who earns around £3m a year, seemed aware of the comparison
between his performance and the popular 'Allo 'Allo 
character - as well as McClaren.

Following the interview, Barton tweeted: 'Steve MaClaren (sic) eat your heart out...'

'In my defence, it is very difficult to do a 
press conference in Scouse for a room full of French journalists. The 
alternative is to speak...like a 'Allo Allo!' character which is choose [sic]. Its simply a case of you had to be there. #youstupidwomen!'

Applause: Barton is on loan to the French team from British side QPR

A few hours later he decided to up the intellectual tone by tweeting a quote from the German philosopher Nietzsche.

He also came up with a novel name for the language, and said: 'I am christening this new language Bartonese...'

Speaking in France before his league 
debut, Barton said: 'Perhaps I shouldn't say it, but I'm maybe a little 
too intelligent to be a footballer.'

Oh 'Allo! Barton sounded alarmingly like Officer Crabtree from the hit television series

The claims in a French newspaper attracted derision from former Arsenal and Manchester United player Mikael Silvestre. 

On Twitter, he wrote: 'The uneducated Joey Barton is fascinating for the degree of his stupidity, his ego and his megalomania!'

Barton helped his side beat Lille 1-0 in the match at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday.
