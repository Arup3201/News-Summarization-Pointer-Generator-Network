Actor Ray Winstone says he may quit the UK because it has been ‘raped’ by high taxes.

The former boxer, 56, said:  ‘I can see myself leaving. I love this country but I’ve had enough.'

The actor added: 'I don’t see what we are being given back. I just see the country being raped.’

Fed up: The 56-year-old actor told talkSPORT Radio that the taxman is 'taking too much in exchange for too little'

Criticism: The actor said that he could not see what the country was being given back, adding: ' I just see the country being raped'

Winstone told talkSPORT Radio that the taxman was ‘taking too much in exchange for too little’.

He added: ‘There are more holes in the roads than a tennis racket, we can’t build hospitals and fire stations are closing.’

The timing of Winstone's comes amid growing tension within the Cabinet ahead of George Osborne's Budget announcement.

Secretary of State for Business Vince Cable yesterday reiterated his belief that the Government should introduce a 'mansion tax' to reduce the budget deficit.

The tax would affect those with a property valued at a specified figure or above - potentially £1million.

Labour supports he introduction of the tax, while Nick Clegg has also attacked David Cameron as being 'stuck in the past' for opposing it.

Winstone is among the UK's acting elite, having enjoyed a lengthy career involving a number of hit movies, including Scum and Martin Scorcese's The Departed.
