Hearing: Gary Quigley arrives at Southwark Crown Court today, accused of allegedly putting anti-freeze in his Lucozade because it kept being stolen

A Scotland Yard detective today denied poisoning a colleague by putting antifreeze in his Lucozade, allegedly to catch an office thief.

Metropolitan Police officer Gary Quigley, 46, will face trial over an accusation that he put Steve Halfhide in hospital by spiking an energy drink he left in a fridge at their Stratford office.

Mr Halfhide collapsed after sipping from the bottle, but later made a full recovery, and Quigley today appeared in court to deny administering a poison or substance with intent.

The police officer, who appeared at Southwark Crown Court today wearing a striped shirt, purple tied and black coat spoke today only to confirm his name and deny the charge brought against him.

He will now face a trial at Southwark Crown Court that is expected to last three to four days.

Judge Anthony Leonard QC bailed Quigley until his trial.

'Your trial is going to the warned list for the week commencing April 2,' he said.

'It is your responsibility to keep in touch with your solicitor so you know the time when your trial will start.'
