A pair of fraudsters conned investors in their sham company out of £200,000 by wining and dining them in expensive restaurants and creating a fake luxury lifestyle.

Michael Taylor, 46, took people to plush restaurants in sports cars and promised them that if they pumped money into his firm: 'All this could be yours'.

Along with his accomplice Joanne Marston, 31, Taylor promised investors huge profits in return for buying into Tenretni - internet spelt backwards.

One of the pair's victims went bankrupt after re-mortgaging his home to invest.

Taylor was jailed for 32 months at Swansea Crown Court after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud while Marston was sentenced to a two year suspended sentence and ordered to do 180 hours of community service.

The court heard how the pair leased a Porsche, two Mercedes and other sports cars as a front for their fraud.

Taylor's company Tenretni sold websites and training packages for an online marketing scheme and promised investors huge returns on commission from online companies.

But it never delivered on that promise.

An investigation by Carmarthenshire Council found the pair had defrauded their victims out of £197,500 but the money was spent on hotels, restaurants and the leased cars.

Prosecutor Andrew Davies said: 'They targeted potential investors, including elderly people with a retirement funds.

'They lured them to South Wales were they were shown a luxury lifestyle with the promise that they could achieve the same.

'They would take them out to dinner to convince them to become investors in the business.'

Mother-of-three Marston was originally one of Taylor's victims but went into business with him after becoming 'infatuated' with the conman.

Mr Davies added: 'Despite her background and knowing the difficulties it could lead to, in the early months of 2008, she became part of the company.'

Ian Wright, defending Marston, said her marriage had failed because of her involvement with Taylor.

Her ex husband was in court and had provided a 'substantial sum as compensation' for the victims.

Sentencing the pair, Judge Huw Davies said: 'A significant number of people lost everything that they put in.

'As you knew, many of these people could not really afford the investment.

'There were investors who were so desperately worried about the consequences that they became ill, chronically ill.

'There were investors who lost a cherished family home and investors who borrowed in order to invest at a cost they simply could not sustain and are carrying ever increasing costs as a result.

'These people were not naive, they were trusting and they put their trust in the wrong people.'
