Tesco has bowed to public pressure and says it will remove unnecessary nut allergy warnings from products such as ham, baked beans and even tonic water.

The supermarket triggered anger among allergy sufferers earlier this year after ‘may contain nuts’ warnings were added to hundreds of products without good reason.

Sufferers were left confused about what was safe to eat after the warning appeared on everything from cooked ham to apple juice, tonic water, bags of new potatoes and baked beans.

The firm has finally relented after refusing to remove the labels which 'comply with EU rules'

Thousands of people signed a petition calling on the store to remove the warnings.

Tesco initially rejected the complaints, saying it had changed the format of its labels to comply with EU rules due to come in later this year.

But Britain’s biggest grocer has now 
relented, admitting it went too far and announcing that the warnings 
will be removed from many of the products.

A spokesman said: ‘Recently, how we label has changed and in that changeover the “may contain” statement has been put on products it shouldn’t and caused a lot of confusion and anguish among our customers – for which we are very sorry.’

He said Tesco’s policy was to carry warning labels only where there was a genuine risk and the company had asked suppliers to review the need to apply the nuts safety message to packs.

‘The risk assessments for products with a “may contain” statement are being reviewed and where following that review we can’t demonstrate there is a significant risk of cross-contamination we will remove the “may contain” statement,’ he added.

Campaigner Alexa Baracaia, whose 
three-year-old son is allergic to nuts, welcomed the change of policy, 
but said the campaign would continue.

‘While we obviously welcome Tesco’s admission after weeks of claiming otherwise that they did get their labelling wrong, we now want Tesco to engage with us properly and fully until the situation is resolved,’ she told the Grocer.

‘We expect to be kept informed of which items will see the “may contain” labels removed and when.

‘Tesco also needs to dramatically improve its communications with allergic consumers: we are entitled to full explanations of risk for specific products and will absolutely not be fobbed off with any more generalised and, indeed, factually incorrect responses from ill-informed staff.’
