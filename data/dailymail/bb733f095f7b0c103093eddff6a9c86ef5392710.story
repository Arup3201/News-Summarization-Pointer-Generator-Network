Martin Demichelis fully deserves his recall to the Argentina squad while Carlos Tevez was never going to make it after failing to patch up his differences with coach Alejandro Sabella, forward Sergio Aguero said.

Despite some sparkling form for Italian champions Juventus, Tevez has never been part of Sabella's plans and was again overlooked when the coach named his provisional 30-man squad for the tournament in Brazil on Tuesday.

Manchester City striker Aguero, who is expected to line up alongside Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain in a formidable front line for Argentina, believed a recall was never going to happen.

Happy to help: The Manchester City defender was given the words of support from Sergio Aguero

'This has been discussed for three years now since the manager was hired for the team and since then we know there was no relationship between them both,' the 25-year-old Aguero said in Singapore on Friday.

'He didn't call him before so it wasn't such a surprise that he wasn't called this time as well. It would be a very good question for the manager himself to comment,' he added, trying to avoid the talking point.

Instead, the pony-tailed Demichelis, so frequently mocked by rival English Premier League supporters following some early mistakes upon his arrival at Manchester City at the start of the season, was the surprise inclusion.

The former River Plate and Bayern Munich defender last played for Argentina in a 1-1 home draw against Bolivia in a qualifier in November 2011 but has shown strong form in recent weeks as City went on to win the Premier League title on Sunday.

While Aguero is a certain starter for the Group F matches against Bosnia, Iran and Nigeria, the 33-year-old Demichelis will be hoping just to make the slimmed down 23-man travelling party, although he had support for his cause.

'It was no surprise that he was called for playing in this World Cup, I think he has earned his position,' Aguero said.

'He had been criticised, in particular because of the play against Lionel Messi in the (Champions League) match against Barcelona but it is understandable, he wasn't so confident then after starting to play in the English league.

'In the last three or four months, he has been playing very well and adapted and I think that is why he was called up and earned his place in the team.'
