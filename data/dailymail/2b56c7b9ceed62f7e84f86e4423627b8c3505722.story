Thousands of Arizona children may be suffering abuse despite bravely calling government help hotlines that then ignored their pleas for help.

A shocking 6,000 potential child abuse cases have gone uninvestigated since 2009 because a blunder in the system meant the calls were misclassified, the state's director of child welfare revealed today. And the department also admitted it had no idea if those children are still at risk of abuse.

Department of Economic Security Director Clarence Carter said all 6,000 cases will be reviewed after they were incorrectly logged as not requiring investigations by a staffer in the agency's call center.

They learned of the error after the introduction of a new hotline process in January led to the number of cases rapidly escalating. A probe then revealed the system had been failing children for more than four years.

According to Azcentral.com, CPS caseloads are currently 77 per cent above standards.

At least 125 cases already have been identified where children subsequently became the subject of child abuse investigations.

Arizona's Child Protective Services department has been one of Governor Jan Brewer's major priorities.

Brewer's response to the unbelievable news was 'unprintable.'

'I have never seen my boss with such a combination of anger and sadness,' he said, according to AzCentral.com.

The director, who has been in his post for three years, added that while he felt he still had the governor's support, 'I did get the sense she is holding me responsible.'

In January, Brewer signed a bill allowing the immediate hiring of 50 new CPS workers after the state Legislature overwhelmingly approved her emergency request for $4.4 million.

She was surrounded by Senate and House members from both parties in a rare example of bipartisan cooperation.

There was no opposition to the measure in either chamber.

Of the 6,000 reports, 5,000 have come into the state hotline in the last 20 months.

In addition to the internal review, the Arizona Department of Public Safety to look over the process the agency has used to classify cases.

Arizona politicians slammed the discovery at a legislative oversight hearing this afternoon in the state Senate.

'This has to come out,' said Phoenix Republican Kate Brophy McGee who is co-chair of the oversight committee on CPS. 'I am hopeful it's the start to finding solutions to what the heck is going on.'

She added: 'I've just had this horrible feeling that something is so wrong, and has been so for so very long. This seems to be a systemic issue, and maybe this is the start of unwinding the problems. We can fix them. This is an enormous finding, an enormous one.'
