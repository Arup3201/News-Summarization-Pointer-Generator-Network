Seven months after it capsized off the coast of Italy claiming the lives of 32 passengers, the wreck of the Costa Concordia has become a grim tourist attraction.

So many people want to see the stricken cruise ship up close, thousands are queuing up each day to catch a ferry that passes within metres of its submerged shell.

Visitors drawn to the macabre attraction will have a little longer to catch a glimpse of the vessel - a project to refloat the Costa Concordia was this week delayed until next spring.

Macabre: Daytrippers to Giglio capture snapshots of the Costa Concordia as they pass on a ferry from the Italian mainland

Sightseers: Visitors have flocked to the tiny Tuscan island all summer, drawn by the submerged ship

The Costa Concordia ran into a reef 
and capsized off the coast of the Tuscan island of Giglio on Friday 
January 13 after Captain Francesco Schettino made an unauthorised 
diversion from his programmed route.

He was arrested and accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship.

Rescue: Salvage teams hoped to refloat the ship in time for the first anniversary of the wreck, but plans have been delayed til spring 2013

More than six months on and the tiny isle has teemed with tourists all summer, a sharp increase on previous years.

In nearby Santo Stefano, 15km away and
 attached to the Italian mainliand, ticket touts advertise the 10 euro 
tickets as a chance to see the stricken cruise ship as the ferries pass 
within metres of the Concordia, meaning tourists can take photos of the 
vessel.

Describing the island as a 'museum', 
Giglio's mayor, Sergio Ortelli, confirmed: 'There has been a rise in the
 number of tourists coming for the day, with curious people taking 
photos of the giant sprawled on the rocks.'

Refloat: A joint US-Italian team plans to use cranes to haul the submerged half of the ship out of the water

A consortium hired to remove the 950ft-long, 116ft-wide,
114,500tonne ship had hoped to complete their mission by January 2013, but 
have been forced to extend the deadline due the vast scale of the task ahead of them.

US-based Titan Salvage and Italian 
partner Micoperi insist the new timeline is a 'realistic' target for 
what will be the largest refloat in history.

In order to raise the Costa 
Concordia, Titan will install underwater platforms under the submerged 
side of the ship and use huge cranes to pull the ship upright.

An intricate balancing act, using watertight boxes, will then steady the ship before it is towed away and dismantled.
