Butterfly numbers have nearly halved in the last four decades – despite last year’s sizzling summer, say conservationists.

The insects, which thrive in warm and sunny conditions, are still recovering from an onslaught of washout summers.

The wet summer of 2012 was the worst on record for butterflies –with some rare species in certain parts of Britain being wiped out.

Butterfly numbers have nearly halved in the last four decades, but last 
year's hot summer was excellent for the insects with numbers up 
significantly. Among those breeds seeing a resurgence is the Clouded 
Yellow (top)

Small tortoiseshell butterflies are among the breeds that saw an increase last year, their population rising 278 per cent

Last year’s hot weather was excellent for the insects, with numbers up significantly compared to 2012, according to the UK  Butterfly Monitoring Scheme.

But despite the 2013 boost, numbers were still at a worrying 53 per cent of the population in 1976 – well below average.

Dr Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation, which led the survey, said there was still a long way to go before butterflies returned to their former glories.

He said: ‘We had successive bad summers from 2007 to 2012, it was terrible.

Last summer was better and there was a real bounce back, but we need another good spring and summer for them to breed successfully.’

Some 46 of the 56 species in the Monitoring Scheme in 2013 saw numbers increase.

Rare species such as the Lulworth skipper were up 162 per cent compared with 2012, and the critically endangered high brown fritillary by 133 per cent.

Common species also saw a revival – the small, large and green-veined whites bounced back from their worst year on record in 2012 to above average numbers in 2013.

The small tortoiseshell had its best year in a decade and migrants such as clouded yellow butterflies from the Continent also increased.
