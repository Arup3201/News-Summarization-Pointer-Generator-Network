A former South Florida man has been arrested in Mexico, 37 years after he went on the run to avoid serving a 10-month prison sentence.

Authorities apprehended Robert Anton Woodring, 81, in Guadalajara, Mexico.

Miami U.S. Attorney's officials say Woodring was indicted in 1984 for failing to surrender in 1977 to start his sentence for removing a yacht so that authorities couldn't seize it.

Woodring had also been sentenced in a related case to seven years in prison after a jury found him guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.

U.S. Marshals apprehended him last month.  

He appeared December 22 in Los Angeles federal court and agreed to be transported to Miami after waiving his right to identity and removal hearings, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. 

He is set to be arraigned Wednesday.
