Lord Ouseley, chairman of Kick It Out and the country’s leading anti-discrimination campaigner, has been given the ideal platform to discuss the Malky Mackay-Dave Whelan controversy at Wigan.

Lord Ouseley is one of the key-note speakers at the League Managers’ Association’s annual management conference on Tuesday at the British Museum. The summit, at which Sir Alex Ferguson and Steve McClaren are also speaking, is being billed as how leadership, health and wellbeing contribute to elite performance.

But Lord Ouseley will not miss the chance to tell the star-studded audience that change has to happen after a number of recent anti- discriminatory issues which the football authorities have tried to brush under the carpet.

Not least the LMA, who invited Ouseley to their event after the storm of criticism that greeted managers’ union chief executive Richard Bevan cluelessly describing Mackay’s exchange of racist, sexist and homophobic tweets as ‘letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter’.

Meanwhile, Wigan chairman Whelan, who says he will quit the club if the FA even suggest he is guilty of racism, has until tomorrow to reply to them about his offensive comments about Chinese and Jewish people when defending his appointment of manager Mackay.

The blunder of printing a photo of the wrong RFU president in the 2008 England vs Wales programme caused meltdown among the Twickenham blazers. It was not great, therefore, that the programme welcome from current president Jonathan Dance for Saturday’s England vs Samoa game England expected a lively encounter ‘this afternoon’ when the match kicked off at 7pm. 

Heads have rolled for less, especially as Dance’s own rugby memorabilia collection includes programmes with the botched presidential picture of Bob Rogers and one of the few printed with the correct face, Bob Taylor.

Premier League referee Michael Oliver resigned from Northumberland FA’s referee academy in protest at the county FA not taking further action against dinosaur vice-president John Cummings. The FA banned Cummings for four months after telling young referee Lucy May (right), Oliver’s partner, that a women’s place is in the kitchen. Caught in the middle is Oliver’s father Clive, Northumberland CEO whose son’s resignation is one of five.

England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke’s seven-year reign is expected to end next March. The current belief is that Clarke will not stand for re-election, paving the way for Yorkshire’s ambitious Colin Graves to take the helm, although Clarke would remain on the International Cricket Council. Graves, whose cheerleaders within the ECB include chief operating officer Gordon Hollins and commercial director Sanjay Patel, might face a candidate from outside the game but would be an overwhelming favourite. However, if Clarke does a U–turn Graves would not oppose him.

Ticket site making waves

Ticketmaster, the official ticketing partners of England Rugby 2015, have bought Seatwave, who are one of the secondary ticket online operators ER2015 are desperate to curb with Government legislation. Ticketmaster already have Get Me In under their umbrella but want to increase trade in the secondary market — despite the conflict of interest with their Rugby World Cup partnership which one ticketing chief described as ‘unbelievable in its hyprocrisy’. ER2015 say Seatwave have removed all references to World Cup tickets from their site.

Sky Sports News personnel have made a habit of sending out joke tweets that could easily be misinterpreted despite the 24/7 scrutiny of the Twittersphere — not least by their own TV station. So director’s assistant Emily Ward is the latest to find herself in hot water at Isleworth for posting a saucy Instagram with the message ‘Would you like some p**** with your coffee’. Sky said the post had been taken down and Ward reminded about social media perils.

BBC Radio 5 Live are strapped for cash to the extent they have ditched their commentary of the PDC World Darts final because the organisers have asked for a rights fee. A BBC spokesperson said: ‘Our budget does not allow us.’
