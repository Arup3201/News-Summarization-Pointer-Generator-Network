Families of the Colorado theater shooting victims have come together to voice their pain and anger at the way the millions of dollars raised since the tragedy are being distributed.

At an emotional news conference Tuesday in Aurora, group spokesman Tom Teves, whose son was killed, criticized fundraisers for not giving victims a voice in how the money is distributed, even though it was raised using the pictures and names of 'our murdered loved ones'.

So far, just over $5 million has been raised and $450,000 distributed. Of that, $350,000 went to the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance in order to provide $5,000 each going to the families of 70 victims to meet their immediate financial needs.

The other $100,000 has gone to 10 non-profit groups, according to the Community First Foundation website.

Teves accused fundraising groups of 
being unresponsive and unsympathetic to victims' needs. He also 
questioned the commitment of Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper to helping 
the victims, noting that the governor had attended the funerals of those
who died in the shooting.

'You pledged 12 times that "We will remember". Are you a man who is true to his words, or were they just words?'

Hickenlooper's spokesman, Eric Brown,
said the governor understands the families' frustration and is 
advocating for them to have more say.

He also praised the generosity of donors and said the victims would get more money.

'Everyone involved is trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation,' Brown said.

Victims
and their families crowded on the platform behind Teves, some dabbing 
their eyes. Joshua Nowlan, who was wounded in the attack, used a cane 
and had a splint up to his knee.

Teves
said anyone in the theater or in the suspect's apartment building who 
was affected by the 'coward's acts' should be eligible to receive help.

'I am certain that the public intended 100 per cent of those donations to go to the families of victims, and to use that money to help the healing process,' Teves said. 'Unfortunately that does not appear to be the case.'

He added that he was 'humbled by the generosity of the American public', the Denver Post reported, but outraged that the money had been 'solicited using the names and faces of our loved ones'.

Teves' own family has not received any money.

Chantel Blunk, whose husband was shot and killed, toldÂ ABC News she received a check for $5,000 and told she would not be getting any more. She said that COVA refused to pay for plane tickets for her young children to travel with her to Colorado from Reno, Nevada.

Joker: James Eagan Holmes is accused in the shooting which took place at an Aurora movie theatre during a Batman screening

The suspect in the July 20 shooting, 
24-year-old James Eagan Holmes, is charged with multiple counts of 
murder and attempted murder.

Only
a handful of family members of the slain victims have spoken publicly, 
and most of their comments came in the first few days after the 
shooting.

Marla J. 
Williams, president the Community First Foundation, charged by 
Hickenlooper to operate the relief fund, said a gag order imposed by 
Arapahoe County District Judge William Blair Sylvester made it difficult
to find all the victims and their families.

She said a group has been set up to recommend how to spend the donations but no victims' representatives had been chosen yet.

'I don't know who represents the victims. There are a number of people who were involved,' she said, adding that the group at Tuesday's news conference did not represent all the victims.

Nancy Lewis, executive director of the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, said the victims and the agencies involved want the same thing: 'They want healing for all the crime victims.'

She said Sylvester's gag order prevented her from commenting further.

Sylvester issued the order on August 16 barring the organization from releasing names and contact information for the victims. The order does not appear to place any other restrictions on the group.

Police said Holmes was heavily armed and wearing body armor and a gas mask when he opened fire on the audience in a packed theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora during a showing of the latest Batman movie.

In addition to the 12 killed, 58 were injured.

Holmes is being held without bail and has not entered a plea. Defense lawyers have said he is mentally ill.

Holmes was a first-year Ph.D. student in a neuroscience program at the University of Colorado, Denver. He told university officials about six weeks before the shootings that he was withdrawing.

Prosecutors have said Holmes failed an oral board exam on June 7, at about the same time he began buying weapons and ammunition.

Prosecutors are seeking the university's records on Holmes and also want to see a notebook that Holmes reportedly sent to university psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton is expected to testify at a hearing Thursday.

Defense lawyers are fighting prosecution attempts to see the material.

Investigators, attorneys on both sides and the university have said little about the case outside court hearings, citing the gag order.

Many court documents have been kept secret as well.
