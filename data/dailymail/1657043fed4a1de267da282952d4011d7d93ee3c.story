Dyson, founded by Sir James Dyson in 1993, is launching a £250million expansion programme

British engineer Dyson has confirmed plans to create 3,000 science and engineering jobs as part of its biggest ever expansion.

The ambitious £250million programme is a major boost to Britain’s manufacturing industry and will be seen as another sign that the UK economy is springing back to life.

Today Dyson is applying for planning permission to build a big laboratory and campus– complete with its own sports pitch -  next to its existing headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire.

If it receives approval it hopes to open  the new laboratory in 2016.

Some 1,000 engineers and scientists will be employed in the new facility to work on a range of high-tech projects, including domestic robots as well as robot vacuum cleaners.

The firm then hopes to build another two laboratories, employing an extra 2,000 staff.

Dyson was founded by investor Sir James Dyson in 1993 after he launched the first bagless vacuum cleaner, the DC01. It has become one of the great British manufacturing success stories, producing its 50 millionth machine last year.

In another sign of growing optimism in the UK economy, fast food chain KFC yesterday revealed plans to open 150 restaurants, creating 6,000 jobs in the UK and Ireland over the next five years.

In another positive economic sign, KFC announced it is to open another 150 outlets
