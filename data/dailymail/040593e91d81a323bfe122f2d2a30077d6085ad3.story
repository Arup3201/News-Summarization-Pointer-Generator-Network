The boss of the countrywide pub chain JD Wetherspoon has said Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurants are pushing street rents up and forcing pubs out of business.

Tim Martin, chairman of pub chain, says the willingness of Jamie’s Italian, the restaurant group founded by the high-profile celebrity chef, to accept high rent costs is causing rents for other operators to be pushed up.

The scathing attack on Jamie Oliver came a week after Wetherspoons announced it had closed five pubs in the ten weeks to July 6, including a site at Finchley’s 02 Centre in north-west London.

Mr Martin told The Publican’s Morning Advertiser’s sister titel M&C Report: 'It’s a pub we have had for years with sales well above average, but with the higher rents it was not working out for us. 

'We’re wary of open-market rent reviews and normally never agree to them. In fact, we don’t agree to them now; we normally have fixed uplifts in our rental agreements so we at least know where we are.

'You have to be very careful, particularly in central London,' he said.

Mr Martin said that there had been 'virtually no rental increases' in the past five or six years even at sites with upward-only rent reviews.

'The only one you have to be careful of around the country is Jamie Oliver, because in general he seems to agree to higher rents in several locations that are pushing up the rents for other people.

'My advice for Oliver is: Be careful, son. You’re an excellent cook, but do you know about rent reviews or understand the property market?'

The restaurant chain - Jamie’s Italian - currently comprises of more than 40 restaurants across the UK along with some overseas establishments.

Jamie’s Italian was founded in Oxford in 2008 and was inspired by the chef's love of the Italian way of life.

On his website, he writes: 'Since I was a teenager I’ve been totally besotted by the love, passion and verve for food, family and life itself that just about all Italian people have, no matter where they’re from or how rich or poor they might be.

'And that’s what I’m passionate about – good food for everyone, no matter what. But the thing I love most about the Italians is that somehow, although they have some of the best fashion designers and cars in the world, they’ve managed to retain a unique sense of tradition and village spirit'.

The Publican’s Morning Advertiser said Jamie’s Italian declined to comment.

A spokesman for Jamie Oliver also declined to comment this morning.
