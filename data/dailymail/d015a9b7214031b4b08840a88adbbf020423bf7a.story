The parents of conjoined twins revealed today the agonizing decisions they faced after a routine ultrasound during pregnancy left them fearing for their unborn sons' lives.

Jenni Ezell and her husband Daze, from Guthrie, Oklahoma, were given the devastating news during a sonogram in March that their baby boys were joined at the abdomen and shared vital organs.

Their own research only confirmed the couple's fears - their babies only had a 5 per cent chance of living a healthy life if they were separated. The heartbroken parents considered a termination.

Jenni Ezell and her husband Daze, from Guthrie, Oklahoma, were told during a routine sonogram earlier this year that their babies were joined at the abdomen

Mrs Ezell told News9: 'We wanted to save them from the pain and hurt that they would feel.'

However the couple soon had a change of heart after a doctor convinced them that their boys, who shared a liver and intestines, had a fighting chance. 

A specialist at Medical City Dallas renewed their faith, telling them: 'These boys have a really good chance. This is not your only option.'

Mrs Ezell gave birth to conjoined boys Emmett and Owen on July 15. Doctors advised that separation surgery was possible but risky - out of eight similar operations, only once did both twins survive.

The couple, who have two 
other sons, moved to Dallas for the boys' medical care and were able to say goodbye before the boys were taken into surgery.

'As a mother, I hope I never have to 
experience a moment like that again,' Mrs Ezell wrote in her 'Ezell 
Twins' blog.

On August 24, an 11-hour operation successfully separated the boys. At a news conference following the surgery, Mrs Ezell said: 'I have two babies … two separate babies!'

Her husband added: 'A couple of pretty good looking babies, I’d say.'

Owen and Emmett, are now almost four months old and remain at Medical City Children's Hospital in Dallas, Texas where they will be for several more months.

They will need further surgeries in the future; after they are two, the boys will require 'skin expanders' for their wounds.

Another operation will require surgeons to pull abdominal muscles into place, which should leave them with only a neat line of a scar.

After this, if the parents wish, they can opt for the boys to have a third surgery to create a belly button for each of them.

Roughly one out of every 200,000 live births worldwide results in conjoined twins, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day. The survival rate is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent, the Center reported.

The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs.

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, experts say. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 percent of the time.

After separation, most twins need intensive rehabilitation because of the malformation and position of their spines.

Although risky, there are many stories of successful separations.

Most recently, Utah twins Kendra and Maliyah Herrin, who were born sharing an abdomen, pelvis, liver, kidney, large intestine and two legs, just celebrated seven years since they were separated aged four. Their family said the girls, who are learning to walk with the aid of prosthetics, are the happiest and healthiest they have ever been.
