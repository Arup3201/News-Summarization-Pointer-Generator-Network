A British man is facing up to ten years behind bars over an alleged sexual attack on a nine-year-old boy in Trinidad.

Former teacher Derek Ide, 66, is said to have sexually assaulted the child on board his yacht in a coastal town on the Caribbean island.

Ide, from Southampton, has pleaded guilty to serious indecency after prosecutors amended the charge from grievous sexual assault.

Scene of the crime: Derek Ide, 66, is said to have sexually assaulted a nine-year-old on board his yacht Chaguaramas Marina on Trinidad

The incident is said to have occurred at a boat yard in Chaguaramas, in the St George West area of Trinidad where Ide has 'strong ties'.

He has spent at least half a year in Trinidad for the past eight years, Port of Spain Magistrates Court heard.

He was arrested in April after the boy told his parents - who are not native to Trinidad - about the assault on  Ide's yacht and the Briton was held by the boy's father, who then contacted police.

During his first court appearance shortly after the offence, Ide cupped his hand over his left ear during the proceedings and sported a black eye.

The Foreign Office say they are aware of the arrest and are providing consular assistance.

Former tutor: Derek Ide used to be a teacher at Bellemoor High School for Boys, now Upper Shirley School in Southampton

Neighbours near Ide's home in Southampton, Hampshire, spoke of their shock at his arrest.

Ide taught at the former Bellemoor High School for Boys in the town, and was elected president of the Southampton Schools Association in the 1970s.

He was also an active member of the residents association at the block of flats where he lives.

One resident, who asked not to be named, said ‘It's a big shock as whenever I saw him he was very nice and polite.

‘I haven't seen him for a couple of years, but he owned a boat here and a boat there and used to go to the Caribbean in the winter. He was really into sailing.’

Magistrate Maureen Baboolal-Gafoor denied Ide bail and instead remanded him in custody for sentencing at the same court on December 13.

The Foreign Office say they are aware of the arrest and are providing consular assistance.
