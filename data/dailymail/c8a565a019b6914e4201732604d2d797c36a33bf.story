Two shocking acts yesterday starkly illustrated the seam of cruelty that runs through parts of our supposed animal-loving society.

In one incident, a thug filmed his terrified pet cat being put through a tumble dryer cycle three times.

In the other, an owner abandoned his injured dog after she was thrown on to a motorway at 80mph.

The RSPCA is investigating  both cases which have been variously described as callous, savage and vile.

Mistreated: Hattie was thrown from a horsebox on to the M56 near Cheshire but the three-year-old Lurcher, pictured left with veterinary nurse Nikki Butterworth now expected to make a full recovery

In a state: This is Hattie pictured just moments after she was brought to Beech House Vets in Warrington

Inspectors said the three-year-old lurcher – nicknamed Hattie by rescuers – was lucky to be alive after being hurled from a horsebox on the M56 near Altrincham in Cheshire.

Despite suffering a fractured pelvis and numerous other injuries in the fall, the dog miraculously managed to dodge other drivers to get to safety.

She dragged herself to a grass bank next to the hard shoulder and was tended to by two passing motorists who stopped to help.

According to witnesses, the driver of a pick-up truck which was towing the horsebox stopped and went back to the pet but fled when the lurcher barked at him.

Painful: Hattie's pelvis was fractured in three places and had to be patched up with a surgical plate and six screws

Surgery scar: Hattie's operation cost £1,500, £600 of which was donated by the RSPCA's Altrincham branch

Animal welfare officer Katie Glenn said: ‘I’m shocked.

'We’re not sure whether she jumped or was pushed but the fact is she should not have been on that horsebox when it was travelling at speed along the motorway.’

Inspectors are also investigating the case of a yob who uploaded a film on the internet of him shoving a cat into a tumble dryer and turning it on by shutting the door.

The pet, called Princess, is seen going round inside the machine and is thought to have been put through the ordeal at least three times.

The film was posted on an internet forum for radio controlled car enthusiasts by a martial arts fan calling himself ‘Nitroazza’.

Listing his location as Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, he said: ‘Like cats? Check out my cat, the new version of Mr Tumble.’

He capped the ‘joke’ with a smiley face before asking users to comment and rate his video.

In later posts he told viewers his cat was called Princess – and that she should be shot.

The thug said in his forum profile that he was 22, had a wife and baby son and also did kickboxing.

Horrified forum members attacked the vile video, which has now been removed from the website. One said: ‘There is something not right here. I was trying to figure out if it was real or not. I certainly hope not.’

A still image of the footage uploaded online shows 'Princess' the cat trapped inside the tumble dryer. The video has now been taken down.

The sick footage was uploaded to the Sportsmodel UK web forum with this message - which asks users to rate the video

The video is later taken down and an apology is posted by the owner

The man later posted a half-hearted apology, writing: ‘It was wrong of me to put up edits of animals, especially in that manner up on public forums.

'I am very sorry if your [sic] a cat lover.’ If he is found, the man could be jailed for up to six months and fined £20,000 for animal cruelty.

An RSPCA spokesman said inspectors wanted to hear from anybody who could give them the attacker’s real name and address.

‘The video is really horrible. We were shocked,’ she said. ‘The door to the tumble dryer was opened and closed three times.

‘The poor cat would have been very distressed. Obviously we are very concerned about it.’
