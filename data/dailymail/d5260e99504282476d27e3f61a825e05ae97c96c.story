SHERWOOD FOREST

There's no better way to experience the changing of the seasons than being out among blossoming trees and swathes of spring flowers. 

So where better to stay than in a log cabin set in the heart of Sherwood Forest? With Forest Holidays' self-catering lodges you can get closer to nature while still having all the little luxuries you need for a stress-free break.

Work off the Easter eggs on a stroll through ancient woodland before relaxing in a hot tub or curling up by a log fire. 

And just because you are going away doesn't mean four-legged family members have to miss out on the fun as Forest Holidays welcomes dogs, too.

PEAK DISTRICT

Fancy a walking holiday that won't ruin your ankles? Door2Tour.com's Easter Walking For Softies coach tour explores the northern expanse of the Peak District, known as the Dark Peak, over four relaxing days.

Led by expert local guides, you'll ramble at a leisurely pace past sweeping valleys and moorlands blooming with spring flora. 

The tour includes the Vale of Edale, the Ladybower Reservoir, an afternoon in the spa town of Matlock Bath and a tour of Chatsworth House's grand gardens and lavish interiors.

YORKSHIRE

To get right to the heart of the Easter experience, you can't do better than a weekend getaway at a farm, waking up to the sound of bleating lambs and birdsong, with tumbling hills as far as the eye can see from your window.
