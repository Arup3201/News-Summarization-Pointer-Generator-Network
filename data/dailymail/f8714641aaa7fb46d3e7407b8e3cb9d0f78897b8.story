Brendan Rodgers never took his eyes off Jordon Ibe. In Liverpool’s final training session ahead of the Merseyside derby, the manager was about to make a big call and wanted to gauge the reaction.

‘He only found out he was playing on Friday,’ said Rodgers. ‘I was looking at him when I announced it.’

Ibe never flinched. The forward, signed from Wycombe in December 2011, has continually impressed Rodgers but he wanted to see how the 19-year-old would fare in his biggest test.

He didn’t disappoint. If the 192nd collision in the league between these clubs was instantly forgettable at least Ibe, with his fearless running and boundless enthusiasm on his second Barclays Premier League start, left Rodgers purring about the future.

Loan spells at Birmingham last season and Derby in the first half of this campaign gave the England Under 20 international a valuable education but Rodgers recalled Ibe at the start of January knowing he could contribute to Liverpool’s push for a top-four spot.

John Stones and Phil Jagielka have played 90 minutes together 11 times this season. Everton are unbeaten in those games.

Ibe might have settled this stalemate, as he hit the post from 25 yards.

‘Maybe I have too much belief in young players,’ said Rodgers. ‘But you never know until you throw them in. 

'This is a springboard for Jordon; to come to Goodison and play like he did was outstanding. You cannot say young English players don’t have talent.’

Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, has insisted Kevin Mirallas has not alienated himself from Everton’s squad after he missed a penalty against West Brom last month, grabbing the ball ahead of regular taker Leighton Baines. 

The Everton midfielder has said he will ‘consider his options’ at the end of the season.

‘I haven’t got an issue,’ said Martinez. ‘It seems like we want to pick on Mirallas because he missed a penalty against West Brom. Now because he says he wants to leave we are picking on him. 

'I have never had a conversation with Kevin where he has told me he is not happy.’
