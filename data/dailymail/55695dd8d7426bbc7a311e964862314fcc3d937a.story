With wedding season fast approaching, finding a stylish yet practical dress for day-to-night celebrations is no mean feat.

One company thinks it has wedding season fashion cracked, with a range of stylish and practical dresses for wedding guests.

HotSquash.com has unveiled a range of clever tech dresses that claim to regulate your body temperature by keeping you warm at those cool spring weddings and cool at hot summer events. 

One dress company has created 'stylish and practical' dresses with built-in temperature regulating technology. HotSquash.com has a 'cool range', pictured, for summer dressing and a 'warm range' for winter events 

Within their 'cool range', the clothing company uses fabrics with CoolFresh technology woven through the seams, which is designed to work with your body temperature and keep you cool in the warm months.

The designer's say the technology used in their dresses helps minimise clamminess with breathable fibres and wicks away moisture much quicker than wool or cotton. 

The larger surface area of the fibres in their dresses apparently allows for faster evaporation by speeding moisture away from the skin to the surface of the fabric where it can evaporate quickly. 

Dresses from the 'warm collection' are made with fabrics that claim to keep you twice as warm as wool or cotton using material inspired by polar bear fur

Dresses designed for colder months, however, have ThinHeat fabrics built in for enhanced warmth. 

The makers claim that these fabrics keep you twice as warm as wool or cotton. 'Our fabric is inspired by nature, polar bears to be precise,' they say.

'Their fur has "hollow" hairs to keep them warm, we mirror this effect with engineered hollow-core fibres that trap air for greater insulation.'

The range of gowns is priced between £35 - £155 and on sale on the brand's website, as well as in-store at House Of Fraser and Debenhams

The brand also say that all dresses, which come in luxe pastels, lace and emblazoned with English floral prints, are anti-odour and easy to wash.

Speaking about the dresses which are priced between £35 - £155 from House Of Fraser and Debenhams, a spokesperson for the brand said: 'Perfect for those summer weddings, HotSquash has sophisticated, silk maxi dresses and chic lace pieces that will keep you cool without compromising on your style.

'If you want tailored dresses for the office, then look no further. With fabric that wicks away moisture and keeps you at your optimum temperature, not even the icy air-con can bother you.'
