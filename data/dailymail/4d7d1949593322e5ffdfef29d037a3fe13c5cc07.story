Algeria's historic progression to the last-16 of the World Cup was somewhat marred on Thursday night, as riots broke out on the streets of Marseille.

Vahid Halilhodzic's side went up against Russia in what was effectively a knockout game from Group H, and a 1-1 draw secured their passage to the second round for the first time in their history.

Russia had taken the lead through a sixth-minute Alexander Kokorin header, but the African side wrestled their way back into the match, equalising on the hour through Islam Slimani.

Riots: Algeria fans causing problems on the streets of Marseille following their World Cup win

Hysteria: Things get heated after Algeria's qualification for the last-16

Historic: They will play Germany in the second round of the competition

Riding high: Two fans sitting atop a street sign as the riot continues beneath them

Waving flag: It is the first time in history that Algeria have made it past the World Cup group stage

Unfortunately, the it led to the rather unsavoury scenes in the French city, which has a huge Algerian population.

The result meant that, after four attempts, they finally made it out of the World Cup group stage, which is an even more impressive feat considering they failed to even score in South Africa four years ago - only managing to get a point off a woeful England side (also managed by Capello).

Algeria will now play Germany in the last-16, where they will look to gain revenge for the infamous controversy surrounding their exit in 1982 - when West Germany and Austria played out a 1-0 victory to ensure that both teams would qualify.

Triumph: The night started as a celebration but things quickly started to get out of hand

National pride: There is a vast Algerian population in the southern city

On patrol: French police out in force on the streets of Marseille

Fire starter: French police taking positions to try and calm things down
