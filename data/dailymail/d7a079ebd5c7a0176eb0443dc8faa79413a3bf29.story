Arsene Wenger has promised to spend in January to help ease Arsenal’s mounting injury problems.

Their extensive injury list lengthened this week when Jack Wilshere was ruled out for up to four months after undergoing ankle surgery, while Mikel Arteta is set to miss the rest of 2014 with a calf problem.

Sportsmail revealed on Friday how the Gunners’ board are willing to increase the £20million January budget to help bolster the squad.

Speaking on Friday, Wenger admitted: ‘In January we will try to get at least one body in. You have to give us time. We do our job as always. This season we bought five players who are all top quality so I think we have done really well, we will try to repeat that.

‘To buy football players is not to go into a supermarket and just say, “I want to buy a right back or a centre back”. It’s to find the right quality.

‘If you go out tomorrow you will see that everybody looks for the same positions. It’s not as simple as it looks.

‘In January it makes it even more difficult because players are even less available than in June or July. But we will try to be creative and have one or two good ideas.’

Wenger will prioritise a central defender and a central midfielder when the transfer window opens. Sevilla midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak is on the club’s radar — but the Spanish club will demand his £23.8m buy-out clause.

Wenger, though, is hopeful the return of a number of injured stars will take the pressure off during the transfer window.

Mathieu Debuchy and Mesut Ozil are both set to return by mid-January and the Gunners boss said: ‘We have gone through a period where we are very short. But January might be a month when we have nearly everybody back.’
