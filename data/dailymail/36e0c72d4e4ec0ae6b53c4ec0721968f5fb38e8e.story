Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has described how the club dug their heels in and refused to sell him during the summer after parting with five of their stars.

The French international had hoped to secure a move to Tottenham after former Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino attempted to take him with him to White Hart Lane.

The south coast club turned down Spurs' advances, leaving Schneiderlin unhappy that he had not been allowed to follow Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers out of St Mary's.

Speaking to France Football, Schneiderlin said: 'I told them I signed for a project that was supposed to keep the best elements to go higher. And before that meeting, Lallana, Lovren, Lambert, Luke Shaw and Chambers all left.

'I asked myself: "That is not the same situation anymore, that is not possible. What are they doing?" At that moment, Southampton didn't hire anyone yet. Chambers signed at Arsenal the day before our meeting.'

The 24-year-old believes the club's stance on selling players changed as supporters became increasingly frustrated with seeing their best individuals sold to the highest bidder. 

He added: 'And the club started to see the fans were getting mad. They thought: "If Morgan will leave, the stadium will be burnt."

'So they guaranteed us: "Morgan is not for sale. We won't listen to anything. Morgan will stay. That is the project. There is nothing more to say."

Schneiderlin admits that he was unhappy with the situation, despite having since focused on his role under new boss Ronald Koeman by helping Saints to third place in the Premier League. 

'It was a real shock to me. I thought: "Why do they block me while I gave my very best and experienced everything with that club." Of course, I was angry,' he said.
