Armin Wand III was convicted of murdering his three sons by setting fire to his rented house in Wisconsin

A father convicted of burning his three young sons to death to collect on their life insurance policies wants to withdraw his guilty plea.

Armin Wand III, 35, of Argyle, Wisconsin, claims he was tricked into confessing to crimes he didn't commit according to a petition filed in Lafayette County Circuit Court on January 12.

If a judge decides to grant the motion, Armin would have the chance to request a new trial in a bid to get his three life sentences reduced or overturned.

According to a criminal report issued in 2012, Armin lived in a rental house in Argyle, a village of 850 people about 45 miles southwest of Madison, with his wife, Sharon, 27, and their four children.

He told state agents that he started talking with his teenage brother, Jeremy, in early September about killing his family in a fire to collect on their life insurance policies.

Wand told the agents he wanted to make a 'fresh start', the complaint said. 

He said he was tired of his family living pay check to pay check and listening to his wife’s complaints about wanting more money. 

She also was contemplating divorce, he said.

Jeremy Wand told investigators his brother offered him $300 from the insurance payout if he helped him, the complaint said.

Together they set the house on fire in the morning of September 7 as the rest of the family slept, the complaint said. 

The pair reportedly lit some paper in the living room near the plug for the television, so it would look like an electrical blaze.

Armin’s three boys - seven-year-old Allen, five-year-old Jeffrey and three-year-old Joseph - died in the blaze.

Sharon Wand, who was 17 weeks pregnant, woke up and rescued her two-year-old daughter, Jessica. 

When she handed the girl to Armin he tried to put her back in the house through a broken window, the complaint said.

Devastated: Armin's wife Sharon Wand (left, before the blaze, and right, after) suffered third-degree burns to 70 per cent of her body she also lost the baby she was carrying 

A woman stopped him before he could do it, though.

The girl wasn’t seriously hurt, but Mrs Wand suffered burns, the complaint said. 

A beam also fell on her, and her unborn baby died as a result of her injuries, the children’s grandmother told the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper.

Sharon Wand suffered third-degree burns to 70 per cent of her body.

Jeremy Wand was sentenced to life in prison for helping his brother murder his own children in a house fire. 

Armin reportedly started talking with his brother, Jeremy (pictured above right), in September 2012 about killing his family in a fire to collect on their life insurance policies - now he wants his guilty plea overturning 

Armin Wand III pleaded guilty to charges including three intentional homicide charges and an arson charge in February 2013 and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences.

However, now he wants a judge to overturn his plea.

If the request is denied, defense attorney Patricia Fitzgerald tells the State Journal she will ask the state Court of Appeals to overturn it.

She said Armin was easy for authorities to manipulate because he’s 'very compliant and he’s borderline mentally retarded.'

He is currently at the state prison in Boscobel.
