In an age before mass photography, they were the best way to show people the world in all its variety.

And whether it is trench warfare, the changing face of womanhood or the invention of the wireless, these illustrated newspaper covers depict world events with clarity and elegance.

The collection, originals which were made into front pages of The Illustrated London News, were seen by hundreds of thousands of people during the paper's peak.

Big stories: The collection of front page images from The Illustrated London News, including this drawing depicting British officers relaxing in the Ypres Salient drawn by Italian artist Fortunino Matania

Revolution in action: Another one of the intricate images shows hundreds of women working in a munitions factory circa 1915, which was part of a step-change in the nation's attitude towards working women

War and peace: Another one of the pictures shows Armistice Day celebrations in Trafalgar Square - with King George V and Queen Mary shown looking on from the horse drawn carriage.

Horrors of war: This image shows soldiers tending to the wounded on the Western Front in 1915, with barbed wire and No-Man's Land visible in the distance

British sea power: This illustration shows the amassed might of the Royal Navy, with ships of all sizes labelled and represented. It was commissioned just after VE Day in 1945

And, although the news magazine closed in 2003, the images are being given a fresh outing as they are sold to the highest bidder.

In its 160-year history the illustrated newspaper, which had a peak circulation of 300,000 in the 1860s, covered events as various as the Queen's wedding to Prince Phillip, the Coronation of George V and the 1951 Festival of Britain.

The works were by famous artists such as Terence Cuneo, Fortunino Matania and Bryan de Grineau.

Historic moments: The Illustrated London News recorded moments of national importance, like the Queen's Royal Wedding in 1947 pictured above

Vintage tech: This detailed illustration highlights the value of pigeon-post as an accompaniment to newfangled wireless communication during the war, drawn by Bryan de Grineau

The return: This image, called 'Home for Christmas' shows a British soldier coming back from war to be greeted by his wife and son at his front door

Alpine adventure: Another illustration shows British holidaymakers travelling to Switzerland, where panel by panel they spend all their money on a skiing holiday

Another illustration shows British forces valiantly fending off a night attack in the WWI trenches using star pistols and rifles at the same time

They were either reproduced in the famous magazine on the front cover or for double page spreads inside. Each of the 70-strong collection is expected to fetch as much as £1,000 when they are auctioned in London this October.

The prize lot, Terence Cuneo's Festival of Britain illustration, is estimated to sell for £15,000.

James Richards, drawings and watercolours specialist at Christie's auctioneers, said: 'The Illustrated London News was the first magazine of its kind in the world. It recorded current affairs.

'It was at the forefront of the development of visual journalism. This collection is an unprecedented treasure trove of artworks from one of the 20th century's most important publications by some of the best illustrators of the time.

'It is particularly fitting that the core of the collection, world war illustrations, should come to light 100 years after the First World War's outbreak, and offer a first-hand account of that turbulent period in history at such a poignant time.'

Fields of slaughter: This illustration shows tourists returning to the battlefields of Ypres in Belgium after the First World War, where thousands of Allied and German soldiers died

Illustration: One of the most famous illustrations is of Lord Kitchener, and functioned as a recruitment tool during the First World War. It originally appeared as a cover illustration on the London Opinion magazine

In the days before photographs could be easily taken, processed, distributed and printed, illustrations were often the quickest way to show people what was going on in the world.

So popular were the drawings which accompanied current news events in the periodicals swirling around London and towns beyond at the time that an entire new genre of publication, which focusses on illustrations, was born.

Chief among them was The Illustrated London News, founded in 1842 by Herbert Ingram, who had noticed that other newspapers experienced a sales spike when they carried prominent illustrations, and decided to provide a dedicated outlet.

Even though just decades after its foundation photography became more widespread, it remained much faster to sketch a drawing and print it than to process a photograph. The most prominent practitioners could create a lavish illustration in a matter of hours and have it ready for the next day's publication.

It was challenged by the appearance of The English Illustrated Magazine (1883 - 2014), which competed on similar footing but never gained enough traction to really threaten its rival.

Meanwhile, outside of news coverage, illustrations became a very common way for publications to grab attention with a unique, strong image for their front cover.

One of the most famous images from illustrated magazines was a portrait of Lord Kitchener, who was Secretary of State for War during the First World War, and whose face appeared on recruitment ads throughout the land.

The original was in fact dashed off for an upcoming issue of the London Opinion magazine, by an artist - Alfred Leete - who had never spoken to nor seen the man himself.

The power of the original image, much mimiced around the world by the likes of the U.S. government with their Uncle Sam posters, and even by German fighters, eventually began to wane.

However, as photographing technology became better it ceased to be an especial need to include illustrations and the job could be done quicker and more cheaply by using different methods.

The circulation of The Illustrated London News began to wane as photography became a staple feature of journalism. By the time of the magazine's closure in 2003 the figure had plummeted from the hundreds of thousands to a much more modest figure.

The magazine continued right up until 2003, but at that time in only published every other months to a small audience.
