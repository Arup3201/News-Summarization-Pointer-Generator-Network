A drunk driver murdered a pensioner by running him over in his van and dragging him 650ft just four weeks after getting his licence back from a previous ban, court heard.

Josef Moscicki mowed down 83-year-old Bernard Smith in the early hours of Christmas Day last year after downing vodka and coke in a nightclub.

Mr Smith - who was known as Jim - broke multiple bones and suffered horrific head injuries after he was dragged the equivalent distance of two football pitches. 

Moscicki,23, even returned to the scene in Stafford and deliberately drove over Mr Smith again as he lay dying in the road.

 A court heard he had only just been given his licence back after an earlier ban for two drink-driving convictions in 2011.

Moscicki, of Wokingham, Berkshire, admitted death by dangerous driving but denied murder.

And he was found guilty of murdering the pensioner by a 10-2 majority after a five-week trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday.

Sentencing Moscicki to life in prison, Judge John Warner told him he would spend a minimum of 21 years behind bars.

'Why Mr Smith was in Burns Avenue, we will never know' said Judge Warner. 'But he had the misfortune to come into contact with you in that van.

'I am satisfied that you were in a volatile, hyped-up state. You later went out in your van in an unfit state to drive.

'Mr Smith was wearing a high visibility jacket and the street lighting was good.

'The transit van was driven aggressively. I am satisfied this is linked to the collision of the van with Mr Smith.

'The jury has decided you intended to cause him at least serious injury.

'It was a truly horrific way for Mr Smith to lose his life. I know that no sentence I can pass can reduce the sense of loss felt by his family.'

During the trial, the court heard Moscicki had gone out drinking in Stafford after joining his girlfriend, who lived in the town, for Christmas.

He left the nightclub and disappeared to get a taxi after arguing with his partner and her relative

But he ran away from the taxi without paying the fare and had another row with his girlfriend when he arrived at her family's home.

He then got into his white Transit van and careered along Burns Avenue in the town when he struck Mr Smith who was crossing the road.

The court heard Moscicki failed to see the pensioner, who was walking home from a local social club, despite him wearing a high-visibility jacket.

His body was found slumped at the junction of Shakespeare Road and Wordsworth Avenue on the Highfields estate in Stafford and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Prosecutor Robert Price told the jury: 'During the course of that journey along that stretch of road for 200m (656ft) Mr Smith received grave injuries as his body connected with the road surface.

'We say the features of the evidence demonstrate a clear and settled intention to cause Mr Smith at the very least really serious injury and at the worst to cause his death.'

Moscicki then drove at an officer forcing him to jump out of the way when police spotted the van and attempted to stop it

The court heard Mr Smith's body sustained bruises, fractures to the ribs and pelvis, a broken leg, torn ligaments and a blood haemorrhage to his brain.

Moscicki claimed he had no recollection of running the pensioner over but told the jury Christmas was 'never going to be the same'.

He said: 'If I had known I had done that (hitting Mr Smith) I wouldn't forget that. It is something that will impact on your memory.

'It is upsetting and it is a sad thing that has happened. Christmas is never going to be the same for his family or for me.

'It is always going to be the day that Mr Smith died.'

After the hearing, Mr Smith's family paid an emotional tribute to the 'kind and caring' pensioner.

His three nieces, Jackie Hodson, Michaela Wright and Jaqueline Atherden, were present for the majority of the five-week trial.

In a statement read out in court, Ms Hodson said: 'My uncle Jim was my last connection to my mum. He lived a quiet and unobtrusive life, keeping himself to himself.

'I found myself spending more and more time with him, keeping him company. I have realised my uncle Jim was the final key link that had held my family together.

'I now know fully what a kind and caring man he was.'

Ms Atherden added: 'I was shocked and devastated to be told he had been killed. This was an elderly gentleman who you would expect to die peacefully in his sleep.

'The morning he was killed I came home to find a Christmas card on my doorstep from him that he must have posted before. It seems so unreal.

'My Christmas morning was spent phoning my family and friends to tell them the news.

'Uncle Jim was a very quiet, intelligent man who had spent most of his life looking after other people. He would never harm anyone and kept himself to himself.

'He had served his country in Korea, was a member of the Royal Engineers and a member of the Royal British Legion.'

Speaking in a statement issued by police, the family added: 'Words cannot express the pain and anguish our family and friends have suffered since the brutal and tragic death of Uncle Jim.

'We have sat in court and listened and cried at the horrific injuries he suffered and the image of him lying there on his own is too much to bear.'

Detective Chief Inspector Darren Harding, who led the investigation for Staffordshire Police, added: 'The conviction and sentence is to be welcomed and I hope it brings some comfort to Mr Smith's family.

'The death of any person in such circumstances is always deeply tragic, but at Christmas time it seems especially worse.

'We may never know why Moscicki was behind the wheel but his intentional actions ultimately led to the untimely death of a well-loved man who was walking home after a Christmas Eve out.'
