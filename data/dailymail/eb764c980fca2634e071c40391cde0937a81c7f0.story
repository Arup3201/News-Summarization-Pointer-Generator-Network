The Royal Family faces condemnation after the Duchess of Cambridge and Princes William and Harry broke a worldwide celebrity boycott of hotels owned by the controversial Sultan of Brunei.

On Friday, the 32-year-old Duchess used a blacked-out car to conceal her visit to the Dorchester Hotel in London's Mayfair for the wedding of her cousin, Adam Middleton.

The following day, her husband, Prince William, and brother-in-law, Prince Harry, also broke the boycott by playing polo at Coworth Park, a country house hotel in Ascot.

Both venues are part of the Dorchester Collection group owned by the Sultan, whose decision to impose sharia law in his country, which would make it legal for homosexuals living there to be stoned,  has provoked an outcry.

On Friday, the Duchess used a blacked-out people carrier to slip in and out of the underground car park at the Dorchester Hotel for the family wedding.

Speaking to the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare, who broke the news of the Duchess' secret visit, an insider said: 'The wedding was a big boost for the hotel... It shows that the royals will not let the Brunei business keep them away.'

The civil marriage ceremony the Duchess attended was that of her first cousin, Adam Middleton, to the interior designer, Rebecca Poynton.

Also in attendance were Kate's parents, Carole and Michael, her brother, James, and her sister Pippa. Michael Middleton's brother Richard is the groom's father.

On Saturday, Princes William and Harry also endorsed the Sultan's luxury hotel chain when they were photographed playing polo at a star-studded event at Coworth Park in Berkshire.

They took part in a charity match at the annual Audi Polo Challenge, held to raise money for the Royal Marsden Hospital, the youth training charity, Skillforce, and the HIV fund, Sentebale.

After taking part in the polo game, which they lost, the princes lined up for official photographs, and had their pictures taken with celebrities including Dame Helen Mirren.

The young royals' visits to the Sultan's venues - the Duchess of Cambridge was accompanied by nine police protection officers - risk dragging the Royal Family into the growing row over the harsh new laws the Sultan has introduced.

The Sultan of Brunei's hotels have been the focus of a worldwide boycott backed by the likes of Anna Wintour (right) and Sir Richard Branson (left). They are unhappy at the severe laws recently introduced in Brunei

Celebrities including Stephen Fry, Anna Wintour and 
Sir Richard Branson have all voiced their opposition to harsh 
new Islamic laws in Brunei.

The
 stoning to death of homosexuals is just one of a number of brutal 
punishments Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has brought in following his 
decision to introduce Islamic Sharia law to the small Southeast Asian 
nation.Others include amputation for crimes such as theft and the death 
penalty for adulterers.

Around
 a third of Brunei's population are non-Muslim and there is concern that
 the new laws could also allow for the punishments to be applied to 
these citizens in certain circumstances.

The introduction of Sharia law has alarmed human rights groups around the world.

The Sultan has condemned the criticism however, saying: 'People outside of Brunei should respect us in the same way that we respect them.'

The refusal to back down on the introduction of the harsh punishments, which formally came into law last month, has seen a number of celebrities make public protests against the many businesses the Sultan of Brunei owns or is connected to outside his oil-rich country.

The first protests were held at the famous Beverly Hills hotel, a 
favored haunt for Hollywood A-listers.

Throughout April and early May, at least 20 events were canceled at the historic hotel, with stars including Jay Leno and Ellen Degeneres taking part in protests outside the pink stucco building.

With the 
boycott spreading throughout the world, Vogue's editor in chief Anna 
Wintour last week joined the stampede of stars refusing to visit the 
Sultan's hotels.

She
 has confirmed that she will no longer be staying at Le Meurice - the 
hotel favoured by the fashion elite and her usual base during Paris 
Fashion Week.

Ms
 Wintour released a statement to the New York Times explaining: 'While I
 am sensitive to the potential impact that this issue may have on the 
wonderful staff at Le Meurice, I cannot in all good conscience stay 
there, nor can Vogue’s editors.'

Her
 decision comes as Conde Nast confirmed that all its magazines have 
opted to boycott the Dorchester Collection of hotels, which includes The
 Dorchester and 45 Park Lane, in London, as well as Coworth Park.

Stephen Fry was among the first British stars to announce he was joining the campaign, tweeting that he had cancelled his stay at Coworth Park.

Sir Richard Branson and Sharon Osbourne have since added their voices to the hotel boycott.

Shoe designer Brian Atwood and designer Peter Som have also called for action, as has François-Henri Pinault - the head of Kering, which owns Gucci, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen.

The Dorchester Collection hotel group is 
owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the country's finance 
ministry.

Press officers for the Cambridges and Prince Harry were not available for comment today.
