Suspect: The battered body of a man was found at the home he shared with Jetaun Wheeler (pictured)

A mother-of-three from Minnesota has been charged with murder after the battered body of her boyfriend was found hidden in a freezer, wrapped in plastic and sealed with duct tape.

Detectives found the frozen body of a 58-year-old man stuffed in a chest freezer in the garage of the home he shared in Shorewood, near Twin Cities, with his 29-year-old partner, Jetaun Wheeler.

Wheeler, whose three children aged ten, eight and seven are missing, was charged with second degree murder on Monday and is being held in police custody.

The authorities have refused to name the victim, but have not said why.

It is believed she attacked him after he tried to split up with her.

Hennepin County Attorny Mike Freeman said: 'It (the body) was in a big trunk freezer, the kind your grandmother had.'

According to the criminal complaint, a friend told investigators that the victim had called on July 31 to say Wheeler had assaulted him and that he was leaving her and heading back to Chicago.

The victim had been left with scratches and had told the friend that Wheeler was 'crazy'. The call had ended abruptly but with the victim promising to call back. That never happened.

The same day, a Carver County deputy spoke to the victim in a
school car park about a complaint they had had involving a loud phone call.

A report in the Star Tribune claimed the man told the 
deputy he was leaving for Chicago, and the deputy noticed a vehicle 
nearby that belonged to Wheeler. There was a duffle bag inside.

On August 15, police canvassed the area in an attempt to track down the missing man. One neighbour said that 
Wheeler and the victim had argued in their driveway about two weeks 
before he disappeared.

When questioned, Wheeler had told the authorities the victim had taken the 
bus to Chicago.

But when investigators returned and searched the home on August 21, 
they found a piece of carpet under Wheeler’s mattress that was apparently 
soaked in blood.

Further blood stains led detectives to the garage, where they found the new freezer, which had been bought on August 5, hidden behind two mattresses.

They found the frozen body stuffed inside. Several bags of 
clothing and shoes were found in rubbish bags hidden beneath a 
kitchen microwave.

According to the complaint, the clothing the man was wearing was heavily 
soaked in blood.

He had injuries to his face that appeared to have been made with a blunt instrument, plus cuts to his left eye and the left side of his head. There was hemorrhaging in the muscles of his 
neck.

The closet rod in Wheeler’s bedroom was missing.

Although the children are missing, no Amber Alerts have been issued suggesting the authorities do not believe they are in any danger.

Mr Freeman said: 'We don't know what the children went through.'

Wheeler, whom Mr Freeman described as 'uncooperative', is being held in custody.
