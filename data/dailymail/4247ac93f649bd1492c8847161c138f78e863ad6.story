A new witness to the shooting of Michael Brown has come forward saying the unarmed black teenager had his hands up and was running away from Officer Darren Wilson as he was gunned down in Missouri.

The man, who asked to not be identified, is a construction worker who witnessed the Aug. 9 shooting near an apartment complex in Ferguson.

He spoke to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch anonymously — and his account is the first time someone who neither knew Brown nor had ties to Ferguson corroborates accounts that the teenager had his hands up.

In the interview, the witness said Brown, 18, moved toward Officer Wilson in his final moments but it was unclear if Brown was moving in a 'stumble to 
the ground' or 'OK, I'm going to get you, you're already shooting me.'

'I don't know if he was going after him or if he was falling down to die,' the man told the Post-Dispatch. 'It wasn't a bull rush.'

Supporters of the police officer have said Brown charged at Wilson, prompting the officer to shoot him.

The construction worker, who's already shared his story with the FBI, said he was about 50 feet from where the shooting happened.

The man said he'd seen Brown walking down the street less than an hour before the incident. The teenager struck up a random conversation with the witness' co-worker, who did not speak to the newspaper but shared his story with the FBI.

It was about a half hour later that the witness heard a gunshot — and turned to see Brown running away from Wilson's squad car.

The officer was 10 to 15 feet behind and chased Brown down the street, the man said.

About 90 feet away from the car, Wilson fired another shot while Brown had his back to him, the witness told the Post-Dispatch.

Brown stumbled, apparently wounded.

He turned around with his hands up, repeating 'OK' over and over.

Wilson was about 10 feet from Brown when the teenager began to move.

'He's kind of walking back toward the cop,' the witness told the Post-Dispatch, noting Brown still had his hands up.

The cop began to move away from the teenager and opened fire.

Brown's hands began to go down after the third shot. Wilson continued to fire as he backed away.

The new witness' account is similar to that of Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown minutes before the shooting.

Shortly after, Johnson told local TV stations that Brown had been surrendering when Wilson opened fire without cause or warning, sparking angry protests over the teenager's death.

Several other witnesses — Tiffany Mitchell, Piaget Crenshaw and James McKnight — have also said they saw Brown's hands up.

None of them described Brown rushing toward the officer.
