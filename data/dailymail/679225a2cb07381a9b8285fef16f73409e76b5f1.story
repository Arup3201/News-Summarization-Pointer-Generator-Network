A brazen senior citizen cat burglar has been captured on CCTV on his latest spree of burglaries at a luxury apartment block in Florida.

Police believe that despite his unassuming appearance he is responsible for a spate of burglaries at Coral Gables in Miami, Florida.

The footage shows him peering through the door, holding his cane while he looks for an opportunity to sneak in.

Opportunistic: The innocent-looking man is seen peering in through the window looking for a chance to sneak in unnoticed

The police believe the man is in his sixties - a fact that he uses to his unusual and distinct advantage. He is just the kind of person that residents would unwittingly hold the door open for. 

Often he can walk right into apartment blocks, discreetly armed with his crowbar and a bag to fill of his trawl, without arousing any suspicion.

Walking around with his cane, to the untrained eye he looks like any other harmless old man.

In February, Andrea Bonggi came home from work to the Villa Isabella block to find her door plied open. She told NBC Miami that her clothes and Rolex watch had been stolen, worth $10,000.

She said that he also appeared to have used a crowbar to open her neighbour's apartment but found it vacant.  

She has seen him before typing in the passcode for their building.

Once considered a safe area, The Gables has now seen seven burglaries in just one building in recent months.
