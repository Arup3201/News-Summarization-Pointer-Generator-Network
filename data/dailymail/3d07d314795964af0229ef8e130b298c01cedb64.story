Rampage: John Richards was jailed for smashing up a 103-inch TV, worth up to £45,000, in Britain's 'best sports pub'

A hammer-wielding businessman has been jailed for smashing up a £45,000 TV in Britain's 'best sports pub' as customers prepared to watch one of the key matches of the football season.

John Richards destroyed the 103-inch flat-screen set during a drunken rampage in which he also hit a customer on the head, damaged a cheaper TV, smashed a window, and made a hole in a wall.

When police arrested him and asked how drunk he had been on a scale of one to 10, the 44-year-old replied: ‘12.’

Richards, who runs a computing recycling firm, had spent the day drinking after collecting post from his former business premises near the Globe pub, in Chichester, West Sussex.

But as he walked past the pub at about 6.15pm he thought the manager was laughing at him, Chichester Crown Court heard.

He then returned to his old office to collect a hammer before heading to the pub 'intent' on causing damage.

The pub, which was named National Sports Pub of the Year at the Great British Pub Awards 2011, was filling up with customers when the attack happened on April 18.

They had gathered to watch Chelsea beat Barcelona 1-0 in a tense Champions League semi-final clash.

Richards had previously been barred from the pub, but his ban expired only a week before the incident.

Prosecutor Nicola Fleck said: 'Mr Richards had previously been in some trouble with the pub and had been banned for 18 months.

'When the pub manager, Roger Nessling, saw him in the pub he asked him why he was there.

Cracked: Richards told police that he could not remember putting his hammer through the television screen

'After being spoken to, Mr Richards walked towards a 103-inch wall-mounted television with a hammer in his hand and smashed it.'

Ms Fleck said that Richards began swearing and added: ‘I will do six months for this but I will shut the pub down in three.’

The prosecutor said: 'The television is one of only 10 of its size in the country and is worth between £35,000 and £45,000.

'He then approached a smaller TV which was broken with a hammer.

Remedy: Pub staff covered the damaged plasma TV with a white sheet so it can be used as a projection screen

Destruction: The window of a door in the pub is boarded up after being smashed in a hammer blow

'He continued to abuse Mr Nessling and most concerning, he said he was going to be killed.'As Richards left the pub, he prodded the hammer into the back of customer Kevin Church's head, the court heard.

Richards told Mr Church, who was at the bar: ‘If I see you drinking in here again I will kill you’.

Ms Fleck said: 'That caused a lump and some discomfort for Mr Church.

'Mr Church said it was completely unprovoked, he had looked away to avoid trouble and was scared.

'Mr Nessling said he was fearful for his staff and customers’ safety.

'In police interview Mr Richards admitted the criminal damage but said he did not remember the assault.'

Police showed Richards CCTV of the incident and he accepted it was him.

'He said on a scale of drunkeness of one to ten, he was a 12,' Ms Flack said.

'He added that Mr Nessling had been laughing at him and he was provoked.'

He told a probation officer there was a history of animosity between him and Mr Nessling and he went into the pub because he thought Mr Nessling had laughed and 'made facial expressions' when he passed by, the court heard.

Shocked: Pub landlady Sharon Chittock said customers were 'frozen stiff with fear'

He went to the pub with the hammer because he thought Mr Nessling had been laughing at him and 'making facial expressions' as he passed by that afternoon, the court heard.

Emek Yagmur, defending, said Richards was 'remorseful'.

She added: 'He realises it what he did was extremely stupid and he let himself down. He lost his temper.

'He should be given credit for his very early guilty plea at the police station.'

Jailing Richards for a total of six months, Judge Claudia Ackner described the rampage as an 'extremely frightening episode' with 'gratuitous damage'.

She added: 'It was fortunate Mr Church did not suffer more serious damage during your unprovoked attack on him.'

Richards, from Fishbourne, West Sussex, admitted four counts of criminal damage and one charge of assault by beating.

The hammer was forfeited and Richards was banned from licensed premises for two years.

Speaking before the case came to court, the pub's landlady, Sharon Chittock, 40, said: 'Our customers and staff were frozen stiff with fear when he pulled the hammer out from his sleeve.

'There was no stopping or reasoning with him as he just smashed it once straight through the screen. The TV was destroyed.

'We were starting to get busy and the atmosphere was building ahead of the Chelsea game.

'We were left with a lot of disappointed customers who had to crowd around a smaller screen to watch the game instead.'
