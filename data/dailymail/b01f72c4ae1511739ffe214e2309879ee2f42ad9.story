Police arrested former Premier League footballer Calum Davenport for allegedly assaulting one of his own team-mates after a local league match in Bedfordshire.

Davenport, 32, a former England Under 21 defender who played for West Ham, has been bailed by officers after a man in his 30s received head injuries in the away changing room at Cranfield United.

Both men were playing for Elstow Abbey FC and Davenport had been sent off.

His Premier League career ended in August 2009 when he was stabbed in the legs by his sister's boyfriend.

Ed Frost, chairman of Cranfield United told the Bedfordshire on Sunday: 'The incident occurred in the away changing room between away players, it was isolated there and didn't spill over into the club house.

'This followed a tense game between two teams at the top of the table, in which Mr Davenport was sent off in the latter stages.'

An ambulance spokeswoman said: 'The East of England Ambulance Service Trust was called to an incident on Crawley Road at 3.32pm on Saturday, March 14.

Davenport had spells at West Ham and Tottenham but struggled to hold down a first-team place at either club

'An ambulance was called to a man in his 30s with a suspected head injury and who was taken unwell. He was taken to Bedford Hospital for further care.'

Bedfordshire Police have bailed Davenport until April 17. 

The defender started his career at Coventry before joining Tottenham for £1.3million but he only made 20 appearances over three years and spent time on loan at West Ham, Southampton and Norwich.

Davenport joined the Hammers permanently in 2007 but was again farmed out on loan, to Watford and Sunderland.

He spent two years with United Counties team Wootton Blue Cross in a bid to regain fitness ahead of a return to the senior game which never transpired. 

In 2009, Davenport was charged with assaulting his sister during an incident in which he was stabbed in both legs. He was later cleared of all charges.
