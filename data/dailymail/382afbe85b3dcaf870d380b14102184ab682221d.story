Mesut Ozil believes that his Arsenal side can challenge the top teams in England and Europe and compete for both the Premier League and Champions League this season.

Ozil, who joined the Gunners from Real Madrid last summer, insists that with the signing of Alexis Sanchez this year, Arsene Wenger's side are ready to compete for major silverware.

Arsenal finished fourth last year, while ending a nine-year trophy drought by beating Hull City in the FA Cup final, but Ozil thinks they can improve this time around.

'Of course Arsenal can win the Premier League,' the German told The Telegraph. 'We've strengthened our squad. We also want to show that we can play better in the Champions League. It's a difficult group, and we know Borussia Dortmund well, but we don't need to be scared of anyone. They know exactly how strong we are.

'We have the potential to reach the final. We should always believe everything is achievable. Not many people thought Atletico Madrid would get to the final. If you work hard anything is possible. 

The Germany midfielder, who faced criticism despite winning the World Cup this summer, also claimed that he didn't deserve the treatment he has received in the media.

Ozil has not always been at his best since his move to North London, but he played his part in Germany's World Cup success and says he will not be effected by the negative press.

'The negative headlines were unfair. As a player it was hard to understand when I'd played such a big part in getting Germany to Brazil. But I'm not the sort of person who lets myself be pressured by the media. I am strong enough and confident enough in myself.'
