When a young footballer receives his first wage packet, you would expect them to treat themselves to something nice and maybe expensive.

But Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden did something a bit different - he paid for his dad Brian to have cancer treatment.

In a Facebook Q & A with fans on Thursday night, the 28-year-old was asked what he did with his first wage.

Generous: Stuart Holden, pictured as a Houston Dynamo player in 2006, gave his first wage packed to his father to fund his cancer treatment

Joy: Just after his latest injury, Holden announced his engagement to Karalyn West

His answer was: 'Gave it all to my dad for his cancer treatment', which elicited the response 'God bless you Stuart Holden'.

Holden's father Brian battled pancreatic cancer for six years before his death in 2009, which prompted the USA star to say: 'He was my best friend. It’s such a cliché, but if I could be half the man he was, I will have lived a good life. He always put his family first no matter what.'

It wasn't all sweetness and light in the Q & A, however, as the midfielder did manage to have a sly dig at Manchester United defender Jonny Evans, who broke his leg with a reckless challenge in 2011.

Despite having previously said he forgave the Northern Irishman for the tackle which put him out for six months, when asked if he liked Evans, Holden replied: 'Hmmmmmmmmmm!'

Holden, who has played just nine matches since that tackle at Old Trafford, is currently out for six to nine months after a knee operation for an injury sustained in a reserve match against Everton.

However he has rejoined the Bolton first team for training and will hope that his contract, which is up in the summer, will be renewed.
