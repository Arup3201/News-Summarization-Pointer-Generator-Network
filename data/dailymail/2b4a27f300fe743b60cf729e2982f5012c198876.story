A New York Jets supporter who became a national hate figure last October after footage of him punching a female New England Patriots fan in the face appeared online is unrepentant about his actions after his ban from the MetLife Stadium was rescinded.

Kurt Paschke, a former convicted killer, was involved in an altercation with a group of Patriots fans which resulted in him punching Jaclyn Nugent, 27, following his team's last-minute 30-27 win.

Paschke, 39, of Long Island, New York, maintains that he didn’t start the trouble. He claims that he was provoked by Nugent and the group of Patriots fans and that he was protecting his mother.

‘My friends were getting harassed by a group of Patriots fans the whole game,’ Paschke told New York Post.

Then the verbal abuse continued after the game and someone even spat on him.

'So I turn around and start screaming, "What the f**k!" But they then ran past my mother and I, shoved my mother to the ground, jumped on my friend Chris and Laura from behind. He maintains that he was 'trying to break it up'.

That is the point at which the fight in the 35 second video clip began, he claims.

'In the video what you don’t see... is some guy hitting me in the face two more times. Finally... I just swing, and unfortunately it wasn’t the guy, it was the girl,' he said, adding that he wasn’t drunk.

Two days after the incident, Paschke and three of the Patriots fans – including Nugent - were arrested and charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct.

Nugent was one of two people observed kicking and punching Paschke.

In March, the fan-assault charges were 
reduced to a $289 ticket for ‘unnecessary noise,’ according to the East 
Rutherford Municipal Court.

Paschke also said he didn't think his ban was very fair when compared to the two game ban that Ravens star Ray Rice, right, received for assaulting his wife

A season-ticket holder, Paschke was barred from the stadium but officials at the MetLife stadium said he’d be considered for readmittance depending on the outcome of his legal case.

Now after completing a four-hour fan-conduct course and writing an apology, Paschke has been told can return to ground on October 12.

He told the Post he intends to return to the stadium as 'I’ve been a Jets fan my whole life.'

Paschke also said he didn't think his ban was far concerned to what some players had received.

'You have football players, like Ray Rice, who beats up his wife for no reason other than a drunken argument — he gets a two-game suspension, he complained.

The son of a retired Suffolk County cop, Paschke spent three years in prison for criminally negligent homicide after knifing a teen to death in 1992.
