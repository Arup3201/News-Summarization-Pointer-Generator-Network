Olympic cycling champion Dani King, 23, has left hospital in Merthyr Tydfil after 11 days recovering from a training session crash in which she suffered five broken ribs and a collapsed lung. 

King, part of Great Britain’s all-conquering women’s pursuit team who also won gold at the London 2012 Olympics, crashed during training in South Wales almost a fortnight ago.

Despite her discomfort, King seemed upbeat, tweeting from her sickbed with pictures of herself showing cuts and grazes to her knees and elbows.

She later added that the nurses in the NHS hospital where she was being treated were ‘gems’ and deserved ‘much more recognition’. 

Her team-mates sent messages of support as they prepared for the first round of the Track World Cup in Guadalajara, Mexico.

‘Thank you all so much for the kind messages,’ she replied. ‘They’re really helping - I’m sending massive good luck from my bed to the GB team tonight.’

After three nights in hospital, King was out of bed as friend Hannah Rich visited on Sunday to apply nail varnish with the injured cyclist saying: ‘Still gotta look my best’.
