Wayne Rooney's son Kai has his own fast food diner which has been built in his grandparents' back garden. 

While most youngsters would be happy to be taken out for a burger and chips, three-year-old Kai loves being chef in his make-shift restaurant called Little Roo's Diner.

When he is not serving his grandparents Tony and Colette McLoughlin at their home in Roby, Merseyside, Kai likes to eat his own dinner in the hut.

It is believed the diner was built so Kai didn't feel left out after the birth of his baby brother Klay in May. 

A source told The Sun: 'He absolutely adores it. Like all parents Wayne and Coleen didn't want their eldest to feel jealous.

'New babies demand a lot of attention and they're keen for him not to feel left out.' 

Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen are currently soaking up the sun in Portugal where the 27-year-old striker is recovering from a hamstring injury.

He also caught up in transfer turmoil as Manchester United are said to be refusing to sell the player to Chelsea FC. 

Former Liverpool footballer Graeme Souness recently said new Manchester United manager David Moyes is to blame for the Rooney saga which has left the player seeking a move away from Old Trafford.

The new United boss was confirmed as successor to Sir Alex Ferguson just days before the legendary manager revealed his leading man had handed in a transfer request.
