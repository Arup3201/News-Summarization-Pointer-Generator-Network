Hollywood movie star Sylvester Stallone was in town for the red carpet premiere of his latest installment of the explosive blockbuster franchise The Expendables III.

The first half decent red-carpet event in the capital for a few weeks and my agent got me a couple of tickets and told me I should show my face.

A gang of us met up at the W Hotel bar just around the corner from the Leicester Square Odeon – Hugo Taylor, Emma Miller, Fran Newman-Young and her sister Olivia.

The dress code was 'Ready for action' and the ladies didn’t disappoint. Fran wore a gold Alice + Olivia dress, Olivia NY an acid yellow H&M gown and both were wearing beautiful jewellery by designer Vashi Dominguez. Fran rocked a diamond circle pendant and Olivia wore a diamond and ruby pendant in 18K white gold with matching earrings.

When we were on the red-carpet I bumped into top chat show host Jonathan Ross. I felt I had to apologize for my slightly boorish attitude when on his show last – I had referred to him as Big JR, which was more than a tad presumptuous given our relative positions in the TV pecking order – but he said he had thought it was funny and that I was welcome to come on his show any time.

We made our way up the red carpet passing Wesley Snipes and Jason Statham along the way and Stallone was on the balcony waving to the crowd. It was slightly surreal.

The film itself is a high-octane 120 minutes of explosions and gunfire punctuated with some classic one-liners from the stellar cast. Its saving grace is that it never takes itself too seriously and Wesley Snipes even finds himself able to poke fun at his recent incarceration for tax evasion.

Two highly enjoyable hours later and we made our way over to the after-party at DSTRK nightclub – and to the biggest collection of models you will see this side of London Fashion Week.

A dozen stunning six foot plus Amazons in body-con dresses and killer heels were at the back of the club on the owner’s table.

Getting friendly? Spencer hung out with model Lily Osborne at the premier's after party

I went over to say hello and here I am pictured with Lilly Osborne, who has just shot a big lingerie campaign – so you will soon be seeing her scantily-clad body on 20-foot high posters all over the UK. She was slightly taller than me with heels on but it didn’t bother me.

We left at around midnight and there were still huge queues of fans outside the venue - clearly to see the film stars leave, not me.

My birthday was this week and I celebrated it with family and friends – and a hair-cut called the Extreme Pompadour.

I felt the need for a change and it’s pretty brutal short back and sides and long quiff on top. Mine was skillfully performed by hair-stylist Jennie Manzi at Paul Edmonds salon.

New look: Spencer describes his new haircut as the Extreme Pompadour

I’m 26 now and I’m told that is the age when you truly become a man. Let’s see if this new-found wisdom takes effect now. I dined with my family at Il Trillo restaurant in Chelsea and then moved on to the Hollywood Arms across the road for drinks with friends.

I received a birthday kiss from good friend Hugo Taylor and congratulations from the rather gorgeous Lauren Frazer-Hutton. I wish it had been the other way round.

Made In Chelsea NYC starts this Sunday at 9pm on E4 and the whole cast watched the first episode at a screening.

Worthy cause: (Left to right) Stevie, Spencer, Jamie and Proudlock promote the Invictus Games that will run from 10th-14th September

Loads more new love interests, rows, intrigue and slightly awkward silences all set within the backdrop of one of the world’s most amazing cities.

After the screening I got everyone to put on an Invictus Games T shirt – this incredible event at the Olympic Arena in Stratford, London from the 10th to 14th of Sept will have injured servicemen and women from 14 nations taking part in sporting competition.

The event, is being championed by Prince Harry and is going to be an amazing spectacle showing our inspirational Armed Forces personnel and veterans who put their lives on the line for our country.

You can buy tickets for the Invictus Games at invictusgames.org It’s only £12.85 per person so it’s a total bargain.

Lots of love, Spencer.
