An actor who is a regular fixture on The Young and the Restless was run down by a car and allegedly beaten while trying to get a Thanksgiving dinner to a late-working friend.

Corey Sligh, 27, who plays a bartender and a waiter in the soap opera, was badly hurt Thursday while trying to get food to a friend working at a Rite Aid store in West Hollywood, California.

Sligh's arm was broken and he had to be taken to hospital after a gang of drunks pulling donuts and speeding in the store parking lot lashed out when he told them to be careful.

Police said the men drove the car into Sligh, then got out and started beating him while he was on the ground. His girlfriend, Alisa Berhorst, saw events unfold, KCAL9 reported.

The suspects have since been arrested. One was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, the other with felony assault.

Sligh was taken to Cedars-Sinai medical center in Los Angeles, where he had surgery and is recovering from his injuries.

Berhorst said: 'They almost hit people in the parking lot. They were hitting curbs, and Corey said, "Please slow down or we’re gonna call the cops, just go home."

'The guy walked up on him like "I’m in the mood to kill somebody and this is who it’s going to be because he told me to be careful and slow down and go away."'

After the alleged attack, the suspects fled the scene in their car - but crashed not far away before being arrested by the LAPD.
