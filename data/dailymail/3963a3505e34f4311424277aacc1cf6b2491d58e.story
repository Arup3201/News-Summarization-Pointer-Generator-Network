It's sounds almost too good to be true - top quality family homes being sold for less than $250,000 - but they are on the market, including a hidden gem in Tasmania which the owners have to get rid of because a relative refused to pay the rent. 

If you can stretch the budget a little more, this could be the stand-out budget pick of the bunch in Brighton, Tasmania.

The Magnolia Court property is a two-storey house with four bedrooms, three upstairs and the master downstairs with a two way bathroom and an extra bathroom upstairs for the kids.

The Magnolia Court property in Brighton, Tasmania, is on the market for only $299,000

The two-storey house features four bedrooms, three upstairs and the master downstairs with a two way bathroom and an extra bathroom upstairs for the kids

Belle Parker of Roberts Real Estate in Glenorchy said the reason behind the bargain price was that the owners were desperate to sell

'This young couple bought it for a family member to rent and that hasn't worked out - they are going to lose money on it but they just have had enough of it and have to sell,' she said

'The kitchen has ample storage, there's a breakfast bar, pantry, floating timber floor and opens up to the dining room area that leads out through a sliding door to the rear yard,' she added

And the reason why such a gorgeous home is up for grabs for offers - even though it's listed at the $290,000 mark.

'The owner wants it sold,' said Belle Parker of Roberts Real Estate in Glenorchy.

'It's an absolute ripper and yes they are very open to offers, I know people can get a bit cheeky when you say that, but there's a real chance to get it even cheaper.'

Unfortunately, there's no romance behind this decision to put it up at this price. 

'It's a case of trying to do the right thing by people but things going wrong, sadly.

'This young couple bought it for a family member to rent and that hasn't worked out - they are going to lose money on it but they just have had enough of it and have to sell.'
