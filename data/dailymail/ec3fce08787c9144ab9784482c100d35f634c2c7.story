Pilots could be made to wear regulation sunglasses to combat high exposure to UV light

Pilots could be made to wear regulation sunglasses or visors after a new study found them to be at high risk of skin cancer - because of their frequent exposure to strong sunlight.

The rate for skin cancer among pilots is double that for other people, and this new research shows this is probably because a lot of low-level ultraviolet light is able to get in through plane windscreens.

While windscreens are designed to absorb most of the high-level ultraviolet light, the low-energy UV-A, also known as 'blue light', is still harmful, and can damage their eyes.

The study, carried out by Public Health England, the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) and the Civil Aviation Authority, found that during a two-hour flight from Gatwick to Malaga, pilots were being exposed to 50 times more blue light than people on the ground.

It also showed that two to 10 times more  got through the windshield than was recommended for an eight-hour trip.

The results have prompted action from Balpa, who are now looking into options to help fix the problem quickly.

General secretary Jim McAuslan told The Observer: 'These could be standard issue sunglasses with protection from UV-A light and, in the long-term, improvements to the design of cockpit windscreens.

'We will work with airlines and regulators to further investigate the potential dangers of increased exposure to sunlight in the cockpit and agree simple and practical measures to protect pilots.'

The results were collected by experts on an Airbus A321 flight last March. 

While blue light has not been definitively proven to be the reason for pilots' high skin cancer rates, the study does show that this is very likely.

Pilots are being exposed to 50 times more harmful ultraviolet light than people on the ground

Past research shows pilots to be twice as prone to both types of malignant melanoma, though their death rates from some other types of cancer and diseases are lower.

While very few pilots die from smoking-related cancer, they are double as likely to suffer from cancer related to alcohol.

Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: 'Being able to take accurate measurements of pilots' exposure to UV light is key in highlighting whether international safe limits for exposure are being exceeded and understanding changes that could reduce excessive exposures, such as wearing sunglasses or other eye protection.'
