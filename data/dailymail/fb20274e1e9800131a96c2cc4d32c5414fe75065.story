Fossilised remains of four ancient snakes have been dated between 140 and 167 million years old - nearly 70 million years older than the previous record of ancient snake fossils.

The incredible find could change the way we think about the origins of snakes, and how and when they came to be.

This new study makes it clear that the sudden appearance of snakes, some 100 million years ago, reflects a gap in the fossil record, not an explosive radiation of early snakes.

Fossils from the UK, US and Portugal have revealed four ancient snakesDating back up to 167 million years. Illustrated here is Parviraptor estesi, a snake that lived during the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous periods. Its fossil was found in Swanage, UK

Led by scientists at the University of Alberta, the findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.

The four snakes were found in two locations in the UK, Kirtlington Quarry in Oxfordshire and Swanage, Colorado in the US and near the city of Leiria, in Portugal.

These are not new findings, though - rather, the discoveries were made by re-analysing fossils that had previously been classed as lizards.

Closer inspection, though, revealed them to be ancient snakes.

The oldest known snake, Eophis underwoodi, is known only from very fragmentary remains and was a small individual, though it is hard to say how old it was at the time it died. It was found in Kirtlington Quarry in Oxfordshire, UK.

The largest snake, Portugalophis lignites, came from coal deposits in Portugal, near Guimarota. It was a much bigger individual at nearly 3.3ft (one metre) or more in length.

Several of these ancient snakes (Eophis, Portugalophis and Parviraptor) were living in swampy coastal areas on large island chains in western parts of ancient Europe, while the North American species, Diablophis gilmorei, is found in river deposits from some distance inland in Western Colorado. 

According to IBTimes UK, the smallest and oldest of the small snakes is Eophis underwoodi, which lived 167 million years ago and was about ten inches (25cm) long.

It is thought to have eaten insects, tadpoles and small minnows.

The next oldest was Diablophis gilmorei, from 155 million years ago, was found in Colardo, while another from the same period, Portugalophis, was the largest of the fossils found.

The latter reached up to four feet (1.2 metres) in length and likely ate larger pretty such as small mammals, lizards and even dinosaurs.

The most recent, Parviraptor, came from 144 million years ago and lived among freshwater snails.

While the ancient snakes share some features with modern snakes, notably sharp, backward-pointing teeth, and their lengths can be estimated, their exact shape and body form is unknown.

But the finding could help explain when and why snakes lost their limbs, and ultimately evolved into the smooth creatures we see today.

'The problem of how limblessness evolves is pretty much unknown, though modern developmental studies have identified some of the gene cascades that seem to shut down and stop limbs from forming,' lead author and professor Dr Michael Caldwell, from the Faculty of Science at the University of Alberta, told MailOnline.

'Limblessness is extremely common among living groups of lizards, so common in fact that one genus in Australia, Lerista, has about 110 species in it, all of which show every possible version of limb loss from fully limbed with five toes, a tiny limb with one toe on the front and a tiny rear limb with two toes, to completely limbless.

'Why? It's not understood at all. I wish I could answer the question better, though the one thing I can add is that 100 million-year-old snakes still had back legs.' 

Despite the finding, there also remains a large knowledge gap between 140 and 100 million years ago, a period from which no known fossils exist.

'The study explores the idea that evolution within the group called 'snakes' is much more complex than previously thought,' Dr Caldwell said.

'Importantly, there is now a significant knowledge gap to be bridged by future research as no fossils snakes are known from between 140 to 100 million years ago.'

The findings could help explain when and why snakes lost their limbs, and ultimately evolved into the smooth creatures we see today. Pictured is a Python sebae, or Afrcan rock python, in Kenya

From 167 to 100 million years ago, snakes evolved towards the elongated and limbless bodies that characterise them today.

The researchers add that the distribution of these newer oldest snakes, and the anatomy of the skull and skeletal elements, makes it clear that even older snake fossils are waiting to be found.  

'Based on the new evidence and through comparison to living legless lizards that are not snakes, the paper explores the novel idea that the evolution of the characteristic snake skull and its parts appeared long before snakes lost their legs,' explained Dr Caldwell,

He added that the identification of definitive snake skull features reveals that the fossils, previously associated with other non-snake lizard remains, represents a much earlier time frame for the first appearance of snakes.

The concept of how snakes originated and evolved needs to be reassessed in light of this new information, according to the researchers.
