The father of an Ohio soldier who was kidnapped in Iraq ten years ago and later killed will finally face the man who has confessed to taking his son's life.

The Pentagon contacted Keith Maupin six weeks ago to say that a man who had confessed to killing 20-year-old Matt was in custody in Iraq.

Mr Maupin, who refused to shave for more than four years as he waited for news of his son's fate, is due to speak to the judge handling the case over video conference next week.

Closure: The Pentagon says an Iraqi has confessed to killing Matt Maupin, who was captured in 2004

Answers: Keith Maupin, who refused to shave while his son was still missing, wants to know why Matt was killed

'They told me they had a guy in jail over there that has confessed to killing Matt,' Mr Maupin told Fox 19. 'They're pretty sure this is the guy or he wouldn't have called me.'

Mr Maupin doesn't know if he will have a chance to speak to the suspected killer, and said all he knows is that an Iraqi judge wanted to ask him some questions.

For years Mr Maupin and ex-wife Carolyn had held on to hope that their son would be returned alive, after he was ambushed by insurgents in April 2004.

His captors released a video showing the young man surrounded by armed insurgents as he sat on the ground.

A few months later another video, appearing to show him being killed, was released.

Finally, in March 2008, the Army contacted Sergeant Maupin's parents to say that remains had been found and that DNA analysis showed they belonged to their son.

Ordeal: Shortly after Matt was captured when his fuel convoy was ambushed, a video appeared showing masked gunmen surrounding him

Ambush: Matt Maupin was taken hostage after insurgents attacked the fuel convoy he was with

His body was flown home but for the soldier's father, his ordeal was never far from mind.

'For the past ten years, it has never gone away,' he told Cincinnati.com. 'When we brought Matt home it was good to complete the circle ... But I never got closure.'

Mr Maupin, who helped found the Yellow Ribbon Support Group after his son's capture, said he knew only a few details about the suspected killer.

The Iraqi is currently facing two other cases, including one for killing a civilian around the same time.

Mr Maupin doesn't know if he will get a chance to address the suspect, but if he does he said he wanted to ask why his son, who was part of a fuel convoy, was killed.

Campaign: Keith and Carolyn Maupin at a homecoming event in 2005. They founded a care package charity in memory of their son

Never forget: Matt's parents founded the Yellow Ribbon Support Center, which delivers care packages above to the forces, to help other soldiers and keep their son's memory alive

'At that time was not a threat. He was just a kid that wanted to serve his country and come home. Why?' Mr Maupin said.

He is traveling to Washington on Monday to learn more about the case and will speak to the judge through a translator.

In April 2008, the family were told that two of the kidnappers had been sentenced to death, and that at least six Iraqis were believed to have been involved. Â
