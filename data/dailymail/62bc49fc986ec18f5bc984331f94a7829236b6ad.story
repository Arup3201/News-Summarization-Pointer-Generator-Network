The mother of one of two Iowa cousins missing for more than a month was taken to a hospital after police found her unresponsive at a relative’s home, police say.

Misty Morrissey was taken Monday to Allen Hospital, according to a police report obtained by the The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier.

Morrissey is the mother of 10-year-old Lyric Cook. She and her cousin, Elizabeth Collins, who has since turned 9, were reported missing July 13 from the Waterloo suburb of Evansdale.

Authorities believe the girls were abducted.

Police Lt. Michael McNamee says a 
relative says Morrissey was at the hospital earlier Monday and was given
medication.

He said she drank alcohol and the relative grew 
alarmed when she couldn’t be wakened.

The hospital says Morrissey wasn’t listed as a patient Tuesday.

Cousins Lyric and Elizabeth went 
missing after leaving to ride their bikes in Evansdale, just miles from 
their home in Waterloo.

Mr Morrissey has come under intense 
scrutiny from police because of his ties to the local methamphetamine 
trade. But authorities have said he is not considered a suspect is the 
girls' disappearance.

A surveillance camera on an auction barn shows Lyric and Elizabeth riding their bicycles away from Meyers Lake in Evansdale, Iowa, shortly after they left home on July 13.

After examining the fleeting footage of the girls racing through a corner of the screen, police concluded that they must have been kidnapped.

Black Hawk County Chief Deputy Rick Abben told ABC News: 'It looked kind of grainy, I mean just -- zoom -- they were by
the thing and so it's very hard to really make much out of the thing.'

He added: 'The girls were less than a block from the house when
this camera captured them riding by, important to note they were riding away
from Meyers Lake.'

The footage, taken just after noon, runs in
accordance with the police timeline of the case.

Missing: The two young cousins have been missing since Friday, July 13 after going for a bike ride together

Authorities found the girls' bikes 
and a purse on a path, hours after they were reported missing in 
Evansdale, a northeast Iowa town of 4,700.

FBI
bloodhounds picked up on the girls' apparent scent near the lake last 
week and investigators have ruled out the possibility of drowning.

An
extensive search involving local, state and federal investigators has 
failed to find them. FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault said there was 
'nothing new' about the case Tuesday.

Ms Breault stood by her assertion, first made Saturday, that investigators believe the girls are alive.

'They
are not going to reveal the reasons why. You wouldn't want them to do 
that. It would jeopardize the investigation and the children,' she said.

David Finkelhor, director of the 
Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New 
Hampshire, said that claim means investigators could 'have something 
quite important' for evidence.

He
said cases of two children being abducted by a stranger were rare since
it would be hard for one person to control both, which makes the common
motive of sexual gratification less likely in this case.

He said it makes sense to look into whether the abduction is linked to the pending drug charges against Mr Morrissey.

In other cases, children have been kidnapped by rivals out of retaliation or held hostage to prevent incriminating testimony, he said.
