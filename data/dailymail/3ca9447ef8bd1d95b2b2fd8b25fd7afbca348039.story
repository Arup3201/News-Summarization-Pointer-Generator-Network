What's a well-connected girl with a hot body and spare time on her hands to do?

Well, launching a lingerie brand suddenly seems all the rage - and it's the perfect excuse to prance about in one's pants for Tatler. It's all about promoting the business, yah?

In this month's edition of the society bible, you'll find Lily Fortescue (twin sister of Made In Chelsea's Rosie), as well as beautiful blondes Lauren Skerritt and Poppy Sexton-Wainwright posing in their own underwear ranges.

Chelsea starlet Rosie, stars in Tatler's Posh Girls' Pants feature

Lily Fortescue, 23, and reality TV star sister Rosie established lingerie line Cheek Frills last year.

The knicker sets feature a Days of 
the Week collection - should you need reminding - and an Around the World range, with London, New York, Paris, Sydney and Milan stitched 
across the front.

The sisters describe the collection, which offers 100 per cent bras, vests and boy 
shorts, as ‘the most comfy and fun 
knickers around'. 

Fans of the knickers - which have a posh £15 price tag - include Poppy Delevingne, 
Sophia Hesketh and Bip Ling.

Camilla Blois, 41, also stars in the shoot. Her motto? 'Better to wear no knickers than grey knickers'. Camilla's great-great grandmother, Lady Duff Gordon, started the fashion brand Lucille in 1890, which Camilla has re-launched.

The fashion spread, which has a retro, 70s feel, also features lingerie-clad blondes Poppy Sexton-Wainwright and Lauren Skerritt.

The 26-year-olds left Newcastle University in 2009 with their lingerie business already up and running.

The duo, who count Pippa Middleton and Abbey Clancey as clients, came up with the idea for Beautiful Bottoms while working on a module for their marketing and management degrees.

Fenwick snapped up their debut collection, a delicate array of sheer silk knickers, bras, playsuits and gowns, starting at £26.

Alexandra Popa, 31, who set up Bordelle in 2007 with designer Javier Suarez also models her designs for the feature.

Stars such as Rihanna, Madonna, Lady Gaga and Britney 
Spears are all fans of Bordelle's sexy lingerie.

In the magazine Alexandra wears a fairly demure knickers and bra set, but on the brand's website you'll find some racier designs.

S & M enthusiasts should check out the Bondage Bride range, which features corseted waspies (£240) and harness-style, open bras (£96).

Whatever would daddy say?

Double trouble: The girls posed in the underwear which they describe as 'the most comfy around'

Camilla Blois, 41, is also featured, but covers up in a modest silk dressing gown.

She's the great, great-granddaughter of British couturier Lady Duff Gordon, who established the Lucile lingerie brand back in 1890, which Camilla has since given a modern update.
