The country remains in the grip of an obesity crisis despite the reams of faddy new diets launched every week, so maybe we need to look at the history books to find the answer to our ever increasing  waistlines?

A new British company hopes to help the nation slim back to health with a simple, old-fashioned gadget used by the ancient Egyptians.

So simple in fact that it looks just like a piece of string.

Unlike ordinary string the Malory Band claims it won't stretch, fray, rub, rot or retain water. It can be worn 24/7

Worn around the middle, the polyester band provides a gentle reminder of when you've had enough to eat. It provokes a state of constant awareness and motivation to eat less and more healthily.

Waist measurement is seen as a reliable indicator of general health and the Malory Band is designed to be a continuous reminder of how wide our waistline is.

It’s a centuries-old concept used by ancient civilisations for getting back in shape after childbirth or reducing the waistline.

Ancient Egyptians, Indians and Americans were all fans.

Unlike ordinary string the Malory Band claims it won’t stretch, fray, rub, rot or retain water. It can be worn 24/7 as its fabric is washable and durable - meaning it doesn't need to be removed for the shower.

The band has a unique button-hole system where a round button goes through one of the button holes and the band lies at a comfortable tension around your middle, allowing it to be made smaller as you lose the inches.

As your waist loses inches, the ‘tail’ becomes longer as you move the button up the button-holes to a smaller size.

You can stop the inches creeping back on by continuing to wear the band after reaching your healthier target size.

By wearing the band constantly, even after you've reached your goal size, you will help retain your new shape

A spokesperson said: 'The Malory Band is pretty and not something you would worry about anyone seeing under your clothing. But essentially, the band is a piece of cord - so if you’re happy with a bit of string, then go right ahead! It’s the psychology of constant awareness which string could give just as well.

'The band is not a magic potion - it simply motivates the wearer to eat more healthily, eat less, stand tall and hold their abs in and helps the wearer getting any bigger - it’s a constant gauge of size.

'Some of our case studies wear the band having lost a great deal of weight through diet and exercise and are fearful of putting it back on.

'The Malory Band puts them in control and does off with the need for calorie counting, food grouping or omission and an unhealthy relationship with a pair of bathroom scales.'

New British company Malory Band looks to ancient civilisations to bring out a modern product that works

Penny Mallor is now an entrepreneur

Penny Mallor, the woman behind the band, began her career as a rally driver and over 12 years she achieved Ladies’ Rally Champion, the first woman ever to compete in a World Rally Championship car and part of Channel 4’s original crew when it first aired its coverage of the WRC.

A TV presenter since 1993, Penny has been involved in many programmes, including Driven, Fifth Gear and Used Car Roadshow.

Penny began speaking publicly and hosting events in 2003.

Her motivational speaking uses her experience as a rally driver as an analogy for life, sport and business and her book Take Control Of Your Life reached number two in Amazon’s rankings.

Penny has diversified and is now an entrepreneur in the world of health and weight loss.

Her new venture - the Malory Band - is designed to motivate the wearer to lose weight and keep it off forever.
