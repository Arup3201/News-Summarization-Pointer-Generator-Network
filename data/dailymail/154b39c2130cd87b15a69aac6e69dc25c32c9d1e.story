Prince Charles has become the latest royal to star in a selfie photo - following in the footsteps of sons William and Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge.

The prince was visiting Tregunnel Hill, a neighbourhood built on Duchy of Cornwall land in Newquay, when scaffolder Sam Wayne, 34, approached and asked for a picture.

Much to Mr Wayne's amazement, not only did the heir to the throne strike a pose, he stayed around to chat after the snap had been taken.

'He was OK,' said Mr Wayne, from Pool in Cornwall. 'I think he was a bit camera shy at first but I got one in the end.'

'I knew he was coming round the corner so I sort of like shuffled up and made sure I was there. I spoke to a site agent and I thought well, I might as well take my chances and I asked the prince for a selfie.

'He was very chatty, made me feel at ease, he didn't make me feel awkward about it or anything.'

Taking selfies with members of the royal family has become an increasingly popular pastime with well-wishers at state events.

Last week, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge found themselves trending on Twitter after agreeing to a selfie with internet entrepreneur Jamal Edwards during a Buckingham Palace reception.

Less impressed with the selfie craze was the Queen, who found herself on the end of an unscheduled photo opportunity while touring St George's Market in Belfast.

The monarch, 88, was walking through the market when Jack Surgenor, 14, leaned into her path and snapped a photo - much to the horror of her security detail.

Luckily for Mr Surgenor, the Queen saw the funny side and carried on with the engagement, albeit after a slightly bemused glance at the teen.

Other members of the royal family to appear in a selfie include the Duchess of Cambridge, who proved a popular choice for photos during the tour of Australia and New Zealand, and Prince Andrew - the first member of the royal family to appear in a selfie.

One royal who is yet to appear in a selfie with a well-wisher is the Duchess of Cornwall, who was at Prince Charles' side during his encounter with Mr Wayne.

She and the Prince of Wales are on the third and last day of their annual visit to Devon and Cornwall, and had earlier visited Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant in Watergate Bay near Newquay.

The royal couple also visited businesses in Looe during the tour, including a fishmonger where Prince Charles was confronted with a supersized lobster, and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage.

As the royals moved onto their next engagement, Mr Wayne was busy posting his photo on Facebook, where it quickly racked up 130 likes.

He added: 'I felt quite comfortable talking to him, you know. You've got to be brave. I think it will be a profile picture or something.'
