President Obama blasted the IRS on Tuesday, after a damning Inspector General report on the agency's practice of singling out conservative groups seeking tax exempt status.

'The 
report’s findings are intolerable and inexcusable,' Mr Obama said on Tuesday in a statement, as the FBI opens an investigation into the IRS practices.

The White House reaction came after the release of an audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, that found the tax agency did indeed single out groups based on policy positions.

But critics fault the report for failing to identify who at the IRS was responsible for instituting the discriminatory policy and some have suggested the audit is nothing more than the Obama administration's 'whitewashing' of the scandalous episode.

Zero tolerance: President Obama, Monday at a White House press conference, condemned the IRS for its alleged discrimination saying the agency's employees have failed the American public

'The IRS 
must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must 
act with utmost integrity,' Mr Obama assured the public in his statement.

'This report shows that some of its employees 
failed that test,' the statement continued.

The president said he has charged Treasury Secretary Jack Lew 'to hold those responsible for these failures accountable, and to make 
sure that each of the Inspector General’s recommendations are 
implemented quickly, so that such conduct never happens again.' 

Attorney General Eric Holder announced on Tuesday, four hours before the release of the report, that he has called for a criminal investigation into the Internal Revenue Service's practices.

The DOJ probe will focus on whether the IRS conducted any illegal activity throughout the course of the targeting scandal.

He called the IRS' actions 'outrageous and unacceptable.'

'The FBI is coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters,' the attorney general told the press.

Holder's remarks came a day after it was revealed that Acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller repeatedly failed to tell Congress that Tea Party groups were being inappropriately targeted, even after he had been briefed on the matter.

The IRS said on Monday that Miller was first informed on May, 3, 2012, that applications for tax-exempt status by Tea Party groups were inappropriately singled out for extra, sometimes burdensome scrutiny.

The report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, that was delivered to Congress, accused the agency of 'insufficient oversight' in its practice of paying close attention to social welfare organizations applying for tax-exempt status as 501(c)(4)s, for those groups that had conservative key words in their title.

501(c)(4)s are a type of nonprofit in 
the American tax code, described as 'social welfare' groups, that tend 
to be civic organizations and political action committees.

'The inappropriate and changing 
criteria may have led to inconsistent treatment of organizations 
applying for tax-exempt status...[ineffective management] allowed inappropriate criteria to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months,' the report said.

The organizations were targeted for review 'based
 upon their names or policy positions' and not due to 'indications of 
potential political campaign interventions,' the report continued.

The practice is believed to have occurred from 2010 to 2012.

The report proposed that the IRS provide
 better documentation for the reasoning behind selecting certain groups 
for extra review and that it resolve cases which had been in limbo for 
as long as 3 years, in some cases.

Critics have faulted the report for 
failing to identify which agency employees were responsible for the 
flagrant discrimination, with the audit stating simply, 'we could not 
specifically determine who had been involved in creating the criteria.'

Utah Republican Sen. Orin Hatch, the 
ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, said on Tuesday, 'it 
wasn’t just some lowly staffer ... very senior management at the IRS 
here in Washington knew what was going on for over a year and didn’t say
 a word.'

'There’s a reason
 Congress is a coequal branch of government - something I wonder if the 
Administration fully appreciates - and we are going to fully examine 
what they are doing to ensure the people of our nation have confidence 
that we are looking out for the public interest.'

Sen. Hatch has called on Miller to resign.

Senator
 Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said earlier on Tuesday 
that Republicans would exhaust every effort to find who was responsible 
for the matter.

'We do
 know this: we can’t count on the administration to be forthcoming about
 the details of this scandal, because so far they’ve been anything but,'
 he told reporters.

Michigan
 Rep. Dave Camp, the Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Ways 
and Means said, 'I am astounded and appalled that the IRS targeted 
organizations based on their political beliefs...The IRS’s repeated 
failure to be truthful is completely unethical and an embarrassment to 
this government.'

The 
Democratic ranking member, Rep. Sander Levin, agreed, 'Chairman Camp and
 I have agreed it is essential that there be a thorough and bipartisan 
investigation and effective remedial action.'

Groups with the words 'patriot,' 'tea
 party' and '9/12' were said to have been flagged and 'inappropriate 
criteria' was used by the agency in reviewing their applications.

'9/12'
 refers to a movement launched by ultra-conservative media pundit Glenn 
Beck, who started the effort on his former FOX News talk show.

The
 9/12 Project was launched in 2009 to encourage Americans to return to 
the patriotism the country felt on September 12, 2001 - the day after 
the terrorist attacks when citizens put aside partisan disagreements in 
the name of solidarity.

The Internal Revenue Service insisted
 on Tuesday that the tax agency's scrutiny of groups with conservative 
buzzwords like 'patriot' and 'tea party' was not politically motivated 
though the attempted appeasement has failed to satisfy concerned 
Republicans.

Joseph 
Grant, acting commissioner for the agency's tax exempt division, 
defended employees who targeted the groups applying for tax exempt 
status, insisting it was out of a 'desire for efficiency and not out of 
any political or partisan viewpoint.'

Grant's
 defense came as part of a damning Inspector General audit that alleged 
the agency did indeed single out groups based on policy positions.

Hot seat: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney fielded questions on Tuesday about Obama's knowledge of the IRS scandal, insisting the White House was not privy to the agency's practices

Acting Internal Revenue Service 
Commissioner Steven T. Miller admitted on Tuesday, 'mistakes were 
made...we should have done a better job of handling the influx of 
applications by advocacy organizations,' in an editorial piece published
 in USA Today.

Mr 
Miller similarly defended his agency though, echoing the IRS talking 
point that the scrutiny was not rooted in political ideology.

'They
 were in no way due to any political or partisan motivation. We are - 
and will continue to be - dedicated to reviewing all applications for 
tax-exempt status in an impartial manner,' he wrote.

Despite
 assurances from the agency that the attention was a mere oversight and 
did not have political roots, Obama is feeling intense pressure from 
both sides of the aisle over the embarrassment.

The Senate Finance Committee 
announced this week that it will join the House Committee on Ways and Means in investigating the matter.

The House committee is preparing for its initial hearing and in a letter dated on May 14, the Republican committee chair and the Democratic ranking member requested an extensive list of documents from the IRS to be submitted by May 21.

'Despite repeated calls for cooperation, the agency failed to be completely truthful in its responses to the Committee during its nearly two-year long investigation of this matter,' the Congressmen stated.

The IRS apologized on Friday for what it
 acknowledged was 'inappropriate' targeting of conservative political 
groups during the 2012 election to see whether they were violating their
 tax-exempt status.

In some cases, the IRS acknowledged, agents 
inappropriately asked for lists of donors.

During the White House press briefing
 on Tuesday, Obama's Press Secretary Jay Carney fielded a barrage of 
questions about the scandal.

President Obama 'has no tolerance for targeting of specific groups, conservative groups,
 if the reporting is true on this, and he would expect action to be 
taken,' Mr Carney insisted.

The White House spokesman asserted that the White House had not been aware of the tax agency's methods.

On Monday, President Barack Obama said he first learned about the issue from news reports on Friday.

Referring to the alleged practice as 'outrageous,' Mr Obama said during a press conference at the White House, 'there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable.'

'The IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way,' he said.
