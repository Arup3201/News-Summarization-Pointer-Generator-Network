TACKLE KEOWN special on being part of that great Invincibles side 

Graham Poll: Invincibles had it all (including a bit of backchat!) 

It was another victory, another game undefeated, another match cemented into the history of English football.

On this very day a decade ago, a 3-1 win against Aston Villa took Arsenal to 49 games unbeaten. It’s a feat that’s never been bettered, an achievement that’s unlikely to be matched. They are the greatest team of the Premier League era.

Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea came close in 2005, but fell nine games short. Manchester United’s famous Treble-winning side could manage only 29 games without defeat. Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest held the record with 42 matches before Arsenal bettered it and then surpassed it by seven games.

And to think it all could have ended after just six matches.

The Gunners were losing 1-0 at home against Portsmouth before a dubious penalty won by Robert Pires and converted by Thierry Henry (who was forced by the referee to take and score it twice) saw them salvage a draw. ‘I did not cheat, I’m not a diver,’ Pires said, although the evidence would point to the contrary.

Eight days later the Gunners travelled to Manchester United. There wasn’t a better fixture on the calendar than the meeting of Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson, Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane, the Arsenal defence and Ruud van Nistelrooy.

The game was poised to end in a goalless draw – the Gunners were down to 10 men after Vieira was sent off - before Martin Keown was adjudged to have fouled Van Nistelrooy in the area.

The Dutchman stepped up to take the penalty, and the rest is history, and messy, too. United’s striker rattled Jens Lehmann’s crossbar before the Arsenal defence rattled him, in an iconic, albeit distasteful moment.

Van Nistelrooy would act revenge 13 months later, but for now Arsenal’s streak, which began with an emphatic 6-1 win against Southampton following hat-tricks from Pires and Jermaine Pennant on a late spring evening at Highbury, remained intact. Just.

Fines and bans were awarded to five Arsenal players after the ‘Battle at Old Trafford’ (not to be confused with the following year's Battle of the Buffet) but their squad, spearheaded by Henry, went from strength-to-strength. The imperious Frenchman, who played in all but one of the unbeaten matches, scored 38 times and teed up 19 goals over the run.

Back-to-back victories at Anfield and against Chelsea at Highbury followed. Wenger’s men then beat the Blues away to complete the league double over their title rivals. This was an era when Chelsea feared their London rivals. Ten years on and the boot is firmly on the other foot.

Vieira and Edu were on target at Stamford Bridge to extend their lead at the top to seven points. The title was all-but won in February.

Good Friday provided Arsenal with the toughest test of their unbeaten run. After crashing out of the FA Cup to United and Champions League to Chelsea in just six days, Wenger’s men hosted Liverpool.

Dreams of a Treble were over, and their bid to become the only team to go through a top-flight English campaign without defeat appeared in ruins, too. Michael Owen had helped Liverpool take a 2-1 lead at Highbury into the interval, and the mood at a sun-laden Highbury was bleak.

But Henry single-handedly pulled Arsenal from the abyss with one of the finest performances ever seen in the Premier League. Pires levelled for the Gunners four minutes after half-time before the brilliant Henry gave the host the leads moments later.

Picking up the ball just inside the Liverpool half he terrorised and taunted the visiting defence before slotting past Jerzy Dudek and celebrating in front of the west stand. Cue wild scenes at Highbury. Panic over. Henry completed his treble with 12 minutes left.

Arsenal secured the league with four games to spare at the home of bitter rivals Tottenham with a 2-2 draw before completing the campaign undefeated at home to Leicester. Paul Dickov gave the visitors a surprise lead, but Arsenal won 2-1. History was made.

A 3-0 win at home to Blackburn near the beginning of the ensuing campaign saw Wenger’s side surpass Forest’s record with their 43rd undefeated match. ‘We are unbeatable,’ the Arsenal faithful would sing, and they were right.

That was until they faced United at Old Trafford on October 26, 2004. Wayne Rooney, celebrating his 19th birthday, went down under a challenge from Sol Campbell. A dive? Probably.

Van Nistelrooy exorcised his demons from 12 months previous, slotting home from the spot before Rooney converted from close range to secure a 2-0 win.

It was 49 and out for Wenger’s side, and the end of a glorious run.

‘When I look back now and see the quality of each player, that’s when you realise it was exceptional,’ said Wenger on Thursday when asked about his Invincibles on the 10-year anniversary of the record being set. Indeed his team oozed pace, power, quality, team spirit and an excellent defence, too. They really did have it all.

Thirty-three players contributed to obtaining 121 points from a possible 147 in a 77-week unbeaten stretch.

Go down to the Arsenal today, and they’ll remind you of the feat: ’Forty-nine, 49 undefeated, 49, 49, I say, 49, 49 undefeated, playing football the Arsenal way.’

Living in the past? Perhaps. But what a glorious past to re-live.
