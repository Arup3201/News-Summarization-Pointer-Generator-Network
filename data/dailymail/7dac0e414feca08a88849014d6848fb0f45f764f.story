'Ladies' man' Naushad Faruk but has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for voyeurism and perverting the course of justice

A PR cameraman who lured glamour models into making secret 'sex tapes' by pretending he worked for a lads' mag has been jailed for three-and-half years.

Naushad Faruk, also known as Jonny Na$h, sent a revenge porn-style clip to one of the women after convincing her to strip for a fake spread in men's magazine Loaded.

The 33-year-old, who featured in BBC Three reality show Boom Town as a self-styled 'ladies' man,' taped women performing sex acts on him with a secret camera hidden in his watch. 

On his Twitter page, poser Faruk has posted pictures of himself attending the film premieres of Sylvester Stallone action flick 'The Expendables 3' and 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit', starring Chris Pine. 

After his first court appearance, Faruk tweeted two of the victims' real names and working names and linked them to a national newspaper article, thus breaching their legal right to anonymity.

He also called the workplace of a prostitute he secretly filmed and pretended to be a national newspaper reporter, making numerous threats including exposing the case in the media and creating a 'media storm.'

During his trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, Faruk, of Goldfinch Crescent, Bracknell, Berkshire, was removed from court seven times for being disruptive and heckling the main victim and other witnesses.

Faruk, who described himself as 'the master of seduction' on his BBC Three show, was convicted of three counts of voyeurism and two charges of perverting the course of justice. 

As well as being jailed, he was slapped with a 12-year restraining order preventing him from going near the victims.

Detective Constable Rob Jones said: 'This case shows that if someone threatens to release 'revenge porn' into the public domain they will be dealt with robustly, not only by the police but also by the courts, as is demonstrated by this sentence.

'The women involved have been extremely traumatised and felt extreme fear throughout, especially the sex worker who was "petrified" when Faruk called her place of work.

'Because of this she wanted to withdraw from the trial but I was able to reassure her that we would look after her, as we do with all vulnerable victims and witnesses.'

After secretly filming the Camden-based glamour model engaging in sexual activity with him, Faruk sent her a message on social media in March 2014 with the video edited to music showing her professional name on the screen. 

The message ended with 'TBC' and a threat saying: 'What happens next is up to you.'

The woman reported the message to police and, after an investigation, arrested Faruk.

When detectives scoured Faruk's digital media they found other 'sex tapes' and were able to identify two other women, a model and a sex worker.

Both videos were secretly filmed using a camera watch, one at a photo shoot and another when Faruk visited the prostitute's workplace.

He was charged with three counts of voyeurism in July 2014 but following his preliminary hearing on September 2, Faruk identified the two main victims over Twitter.

It was after this that he called the sex worker's workplace and, as well as threatening staff, said he would visit the premises with a warrant and take a statement from the victim and her photo for the newspaper.

Faruk was re-arrested on September 5 for breaching his bail conditions and was later charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice.

Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Packer said: 'The filming of women engaging in sexual acts is extremely disturbing when you consider that they had no idea they were being secretly filmed without their knowledge or consent.

'Extreme care and consideration has been shown to all the victims in this case and each one has been provided the most professional and dedicated service by DC Jones.

'They have been supported all the way through the matter right up to providing evidence in court.'

In a description about his appearance in Boom Town, Faruk called himself a 'larger-than-life personality, with a 'particular interest in the ladies'.

The profile said: 'I spent my formative years growing up in the Big Apple, where I learned my range of seduction skills on the streets of New York before returning home to the UK.

'I have spent many years working in my father's restaurants, but have recently realised that the catering industry is not for me. I need a more glamorous, lady-orientated lifestyle.

'In Boom Town, you can see me doing everything in my power to get closer to the ladies, from speed dating to becoming a male escort, trying my pick up techniques in the gym to hosting my own 'Love God' seminar for single men who want to learn how to attract the ladies from the master of seduction himself (me).'

For the three counts of voyeurism Faruk was jailed for a total of 30 months, with an 18 month and a 12 month sentence to be served consecutively and a four month term to be served concurrently.

For the two counts of perverting the course of justice he was sentenced to terms of 12 months and six months to be served concurrently.

This has left Faruk with a total sentence of 42 months, or three-and-a-half years.

In addition to the restraining order, he was issued with requirements under the Sexual Offenders Act and ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge.
