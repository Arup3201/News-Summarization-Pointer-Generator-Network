UFC light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones has talked up the possibility of moving up into the heavyweight division and believes he is capable of beating Cain Velasquez.

Jones has constantly blown hot and cold about going up a category but speaking at the UFC: Welcome to the Show event, the 27-year-old was his most truculent yet about the idea.

'I don’t know when I’m going to move up in weight,' Jones said. 'But if I do go to heavyweight, and when I do go to heavyweight, I do believe I have the skillset to beat Cain.

'Cain’s a magnificent opponent. My main reason for believing I’ll beat Cain is his size. 

'He’s not one of these massive heavyweights that is just going to outweigh me and out-power me in every situation. 

'He’s a guy that I can totally compete with; I believe I’m smart enough to compete with him.'

But Jones is also eyeing a bout with Cain Velasquez (right), a heavyweight he believes he can beat

Before Jones makes any move to take on Velasquez, he first must oversee a victory against Anthony Johnson on May 23. Johnson is the No 1 contender to Jones' light-heavyweight title.

Should Jones emerge victorious, it will be his ninth title defence.
