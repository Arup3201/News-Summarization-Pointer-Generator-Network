A couple told they were unlikely to ever have children - even with the help of IVF - have spoken of their joy at becoming parents.

Julia McCarthy, 36, and her husband Mark, overcame 250,000-to-one odds to conceive naturally.

They were devastated when Mr McCarthy, 39, was diagnosed with teratozoospermia, a condition which causes sperm to be abnormally shaped.

Mrs McCarthy said: ‘The doctor said there was a very remote chance we could conceive, but that the odds were more than 250,000-to-one.

‘The issue was that Mark’s sperm cells couldn’t fuse with my eggs. It was a practical problem and there wasn’t much we could do about it.

‘There was the option to try a special form of IVF which would track down one suitable sperm cell and inject it into the egg. But the problem was finding the sperm.

‘It would have been a lengthy process and quite invasive on my body, so we decided the odds were just too much for us.

‘We had just started the six-month interview process for adoption when I found out I was pregnant. I didn’t believe it at first.’

Their son Alfie is now 15 months old.

Mr and Mrs McCarthy, from Newport-on-Tay, Fife, started planning for a family soon after they married in 2007.

The couple were told that even IVF would be difficult because Mr McCarthy has a condition which causes his sperm to be abnormally shaped. They were going through the adoption process when Alfie was conceived

Alfie was born healthy in December 2012 and is now a thriving 15-month-old

Mr McCarthy said: ‘I was the one pushing for children. I’d always wanted to be a dad and I brought up the subject in conversation quite frequently.

‘As we started to settle down, Julia became enthusiastic about the idea.’

Mrs McCarthy said: ‘We were on holiday when we realised that we wanted a child of our own to be with us and share the experience.’

Teratozoospermia is a condition which causes sperm to be abnormally shaped.

It is often associated with infertility.

In most cases, the cause of the abnormally shaped sperm is not known.

However, it can be caused by Hodgkin's disease, coeliac disease and Crohn's disease.

The abnormal sperm make traditional IVF unlikely to succeed but some patients can benefit from Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI).

This is a type of IVF that involves selecting a single, healthy, sperm and injecting it directly into an egg in an effort to succesfully fertilise it.

But after two years of trying, the couple realised something was wrong.

Mrs McCarthy said: ‘Teratozoospermia is quite rare. The doctor hadn’t heard of it - she had to look it up in a book before she could talk to us.

‘We got used to the idea that natural conception just wasn’t going to happen. But the IVF being suggested seemed quite invasive and a huge effort, and it was not likely to be successful in any case.’

Mr McCarthy said: ‘It was a difficult time for me. Women are often expected to be the ones who are devastated if fertility becomes an issue - men are expected to be shoulders to cry on. But our case was often the opposite.

‘I thought it was my problem and it was quite a lonely place to be, with the way society treats the issue.

‘Women get sympathy, but men with fertility problems are somehow supposed to stand there and accept that it’s their fault. It becomes a point of ridicule.

‘There’s an idea that you’re not even a real man if you can’t create children. Men need to be much more open in talking about these issues and how it affects them.’

Mrs McCarthy said: ‘We realised we wanted children, but the child didn’t need to be ours biologically.

'We got our thoughts together and decided to go for adoption, even though the process was very full-on.’

But then, five months into the process, Mrs McCarthy missed a period and took a pregnancy test.

Mrs McCarthy said: 'To find out I had conceived naturally against such odds was very strange. We were surprised and delighted'

She said: ‘I ended up taking three 
tests at home, and a further test at my GP. Only then did I believe that
 I was actually pregnant.

‘It
 was overwhelming. We were in "adoption mode”, so to find out I had 
conceived naturally against such odds was very strange. We were 
surprised and delighted.’

There were nervous moments during the 26-hour labour in December 2012.

Mrs McCarthy’s contractions were unpredictable and Alfie had to be delivered with forceps when his heart rate dropped.

Then, after the delivery, Mrs McCarthy needed surgery to remove part of the placenta.

But after five days in hospital, the family was able to return home and start their longed-for life together.

Mr McCarthy said: ‘I thought I would be crying with joy when Alfie arrived, but I felt a quiet, cautious relief that they were both OK. It was only when they both came home that we were relaxed enough to experience the joy of being parents for the first time.’

The couple are urging other people with fertility problems not to give up as 'good things can, and do, happen'

Today, Mr McCarthy, a chef, looks after Alfie at home while Mrs McCarthy works as a college science lecturer.

He said: ‘It’s brilliant - but it 
comes with challenges. He’s at the moment where he’s learning to walk, 
pulling books and CDs from the shelves, so he needs constant watching.

‘I take him to the library every day. He charms everyone he meets - I love taking him out and showing him off to everyone.’

Mrs McCarthy said: ‘The best moment was when the midwife gave me Alfie after the labour. I felt his skin on mine. I remember that moment so vividly. I felt a joy which is impossible to describe.

‘Alfie’s brilliant - he smiles all the time and has a healthy appetite. I feel incredibly close to him, considering all we went through. We had three years of uncertainty and all of a sudden we have a baby boy. Every day we reflect on how lucky we are to have him.

‘It makes me think about other couples who are facing difficulties and heartache with fertility problems.

‘Don’t give up hope - good things can, and do, happen.’
