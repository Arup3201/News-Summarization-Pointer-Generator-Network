The mother of young children found living in a dilapidated bus has spoken out from prison saying the vehicle was in good shape and did not smell when she left.

The siblings, a 5-year-old boy and 11-year-old girl, were found living alone in squalid conditions at the end of a muddy, one-lane road.

But the children's parents, currently in
prison for hurricane-related fraud, insist they take good care of their
offspring, who have now been placed in emergency state care.

Sherrie Shorten said the bus was supposed to be only a temporary home while they built their house on the wooded lot they bought in Splendora, Texas in 2009.

'We moved from an apartment into the bus to conserve funds, but then we were arrested,' Shorten told Chron.com. 'But there was no smell when we lived there.'

Speaking from the federal prison in Lake Charles, Louisiana Shorten said she has daily telephone 
conversations with her children and 60-year-old aunt, Hazel 
Burts, who stays with the children at night. No one indicated anything 
was wrong, she said.

'We were trying to keep them in their 
normal routine, around the toys, clothes and home that they knew,' the 
mother said. 'When we left, that bus was clean and did not reek of 
anything.'

The postal worker who discovered the children living alone on Wednesday described the squalid scene she found there.

'The little girl's hair was just 
matted, like a stray dog's,' Vanessa Picazo said after alerting 
authorities to the children's appalling living conditions.

The father, known as Mark Shorten but who also goes by the name of Alan Parsons, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for conspiracy charges in January.

Mark Shorten, 51, said he never 
intended for the bus to be a permanent home. He said the family had 
planned to build a house at the site, which was now strewn with reeking 
trash.

'The house is normally clean. If me 
or my wife were there, it would not be in that shape, I assure you,' 
Mark Shorten said. 'Our house would be completed or almost completed.'

Both children told authorities they were being 'home-schooled.' Shorten 
said her youngest knew his numbers and letters but was not supposed to 
enter kindergarten until next year, and that she had continued teaching 
her daughter by mail from her jail cell.

'Every week I would mail her a new set of lessons and return the graded 
ones,' she said. 'We'd talk on the phone when she had questions. Last 
week she was having trouble understanding exponents.'

Randal McCann, a Louisiana attorney 
who represented the children's mother prior to her imprisonment, said an
aunt had been taking care of the children since the case against the 
parents was launched more than a year ago.

'It was believed by everybody 
involved in this case that [the aunt] was properly tending to those 
children. What I saw in the newspaper this morning was shocking,' Mr 
McCann said.

Upkeep: A woman, who is thought to be the children's great aunt, said that she works during the day but then spends the night with them and brings them food

Survivors: The two children, who have not been identified, are now in the care of Texas Child Protective Services

Mr McCann said the aunt would often contact him but only to discuss the criminal case and not the children.

'But there was no indication that the living conditions were as bad as those photographs,' the lawyer said.

It was not clear how long the children had been living in the bus and whether the aunt lived with them or simply made visits.

A spokesman for Child Protective 
Services said authorities were less concerned about the bus itself than 
with children's overall well-being.

'It's not the bus. It's the condition
and supervision issues,' spokesman Gwen Carter said, explaining that 
the agency understands that poor families often must resort to dire 
living arrangements.

Surviving: Neither the 11-year-old girl nor her 5-year-old brother told authorities that they had been living on their own in the filthy bus since their parents went to federal prison earlier this year

On their own: The children were supposedly fending for themselves during the day and did not go to school but they claimed to be home schooled in the bus

Shorten and his wife, Sherrie, were 
convicted of embezzling money from victims of Hurricane Ike, which 
struck in 2008. The mother was arrested in December 2010, the father in 
March 2011.

In a phone interview with the 
Associated Press from an Oklahoma City federal prison, Mark Shorten said
he had not slept since his children were taken Wednesday.

He said an aunt who was asked to 
watch the kids couldn't keep up, and he blamed the garbage blanketing 
his property on neighbours dumping their trash there.

Sherrie Shorten is scheduled to be released next month and says she plans to fight to regain her children.

'I want my kids back. I am being released April 5th and was looking forward to being reunited and making a fresh start,' she said.

Investigating: An unidentified woman examines the bus on Thursday, the day after authorities found the scene

Awful amenities: The bus had an air conditioning unit in one window and working electricity throughout

The children slept in bed bunks that were installed in the bus, and the windows were covered

On Thursday the bus appeared to have electricity, and outside there was a small propane tank and homemade grill.

The Shortens said the bus also has 
hot and cold running water, including a shower and flush toilets, as 
well as heat and closets.

Ms Picazo said her latest visit to 
the bus was not the first time she was worried about the children. Once 
when she needed a signature for a package, the 11-year-old girl 
volunteered. But when Ms Picazo handed her the signature slip, the girl 
confessed she didn't know how to sign her name.

That was a 'red flag that she wasn't being schooled. But she was a bright child,' Ms Picazo said.

Mark Shorten said his children were 
being home schooled through a Texas Tech University program. He said his
daughter was highly intelligent and 'can even do tax returns.'

He said the family was originally 
from Louisiana but that the hurricane left their home under more than 
8ft of water. They brought the bus to Texas and only planned to live in 
it 'maybe nine months' while he built a new home on the property.

Discovered: Though the bus is on private property, the children were found by a postal worker who saw them running around the grounds looking unkempt and dirty

Rough childhood: The bikes and scattered toys are the few reminders of the true age of the children who were fending for themselves in the abandoned bus

Neighbours told the Houston Chronicle
that the children typically looked unkempt and could often be spotted 
running around at night.

'They always had dirty clothes on [and] no shoes, even in the winter,' said Gayla Payne.

A woman on the property told welfare 
agents that she worked 12-hour shifts Monday through Friday but that she
stayed with the children at night.

'The aunt said that she does provide 
meals for them during the day,' Montgomery County Constable Rowdy Hayden
told Houston television station KTRK.

Looking around the bus, 'we didn't 
see a lot of food readily available,' Mr Hayden said. 'One of the 
neighbours had told us earlier that from time to time she will bring 
food over for the children.'
