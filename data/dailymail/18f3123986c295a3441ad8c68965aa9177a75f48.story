Melanie Langley's face was left battered and bruised with bloody holes in her forehead after she claims she was set upon by two women at a house party

A mother-of-two who claims she was brutally attacked at a party has said she is too scared to leave the house after her face was stamped on by a woman wearing stiletto heels.

Melanie Langley's face was left battered and bruised with bloody holes in her forehead after she claims she was set upon by two women at a house party.

Now the 39-year-old mother, of Great Eccleston, Lancashire, says she may need a skin graft after chunks of flesh and hair were ripped from her head.

Ms Langley said: 'I was backed into a corner and one grabbed my hair and pushed me to the floor, then the other stamped on my head.

'I was supposed to start a job on the Monday, but I couldn't leave the house for two weeks because I was such a mess.

'My face was so swollen and I was covered in cuts and bruises.

'The cut on my head looks like it's going to scar so I might need a skin graft. I've had to get my hair cut off because they put glue in it and the hairdresser couldn't get it out.

'My hair was lovely and long but now I've had to cut it really short and it's almost still bald on one side.

'I don't want to go out the house for people to see the way I look and I'm terrified I'll run into the women again.

'At the moment I have no confidence at all and so I stay in the house when I finish work.

'I just don't understand why it happened,'

Ms Langley said the ordeal happened at around 9.30pm at a party thrown by friends on February 2.

She said it has not only left her with physical scars, but the mental affects of the attack have harmed her whole family.

She said: 'The police have told me there's not enough evidence and the case is closed because they can't get anyone to give evidence.

'It has been absolutely horrific for my whole family but now we need to try and move on from it.

'I'll never forget what happened but I'm trying to put it behind me as best I  can.

'I used to be a really bubbly person and I feel like I'm slowly finding myself again.'

Ms Langley, who works in marketing, was at the party with her partner Micheal Crossley, 40, and a friend.

They decided to go after they bumped into a friend in a village pub who told them about the gathering.

But he says he was horrified to burst into the living room after hearing screams to see the attack taking place.

He said: 'Me and my friend had gone into the kitchen to pour a lager and we heard screaming going on.

'We came out of the kitchen and it was so horrific it was untrue.

He said after he managed to break the fight up, they left and he called police when they arrived home.

'As soon as the police turned up, they interviewed her. She said she was not going to press charges but the day after, as soon as she saw her injuries, she changed her mind.'

A spokesman for Lancashire Police appealed for anyone with information about the incident to come forward.

She said: 'The assault was thoroughly investigated, and a 22-year-old woman voluntarily attended a police station and was spoken to as part of the enquiry.

'All the available evidence was presented to the Crown Prosecution Service, who advised police that there was insufficient evidence to charge.

'If anybody has any information which they believe could assist with this investigation, they are asked to call police on 101.'
