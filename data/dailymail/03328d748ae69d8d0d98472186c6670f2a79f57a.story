A Chicago man broke his 81-year-old mother's hip in three places after he drunkenly fell on her then passed out, pinning her to the kitchen floor for hours.

Robert Golba, 55, was arrested last Thursday and charged with felony violation of an order of protection, according to police.

Golba's mother, who hasn't been named, eventually managed to call relatives for help at around 4 p.m. and they alerted police.

The incident occurred during an argument at the Riverside home the two shared.

When first responders arrived at the scene, the son was unconscious on top of his mother and they reported that the pair's legs were intertwined.

The mother was rushed to Loyola University Medical Center, where she doctors operated on her severely broken hip. She may have to undergo further surgeries.

Golba was taken to McNeal Hospital where he was treated for alcohol poisoning.

According to a press release, Golba was 'extremely combative with responding officers and had to be restrained.'

Police revealed the son had an order of protection, which restricted him from visiting his mother's home under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

The violation helped Riverside police officers make a case against Golba for injuring his mother, according to Chief Thomas Weitzel.

On his Facebook page, Golba describes himself as a self-employed 'musician/singer/songwriter/recording artist' and has posted numerous rants criticizing strangers who don't accept his friendship requests.
