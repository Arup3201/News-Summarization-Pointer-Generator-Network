A pilot who was stressed about being demoted made a series of errors that forced a holiday jet to make an emergency landing, a report has revealed.

On a packed Thomas Cook flight from Fuerteventura to Newcastle, a fault with the wing flaps saw the plane divert to land at Manchester, with critical fuel levels which could have put passengers in danger.

The plane eventually landed with just 900kg of fuel left. The jet should have had 1,627kg of 'final reserve,' as indicated in the Air Accident Investigation Branch's report.

The Boeing 757 was diverted from Newcastle to Manchester, and landed with dangerously low fuel levels

The extra 20 miles lowered the fuel to dangerous levels, when the pilot could have landed the Boeing 757 at Edinburgh, which was closer, or back to Newcastle once the problem was corrected.

The operator’s report proposed the following actions:

The report found that the 56-year-old pilot was worried about his career, as he was expecting to suffer a demotion.

'The commander was affected by the major re-organisation that was taking place in the company,' reads the report. 

'He tried to put worries about his pending demotion to one side when he was at work but inevitably these still intruded into his mind.

'Without this distraction he may have been able to pace the crew actions more effectively. 

'The direct effect for him was that he had been told that he would be one of several captains who would be demoted to first officer … and that his salary would reduce significantly.'

It was discovered that neither the pilot or the co-pilot had flown on low fuel before, and they had not correctly issued a Mayday call at the earliest opportunity.

On approaching Newcastle in August 2013, the plane was ordered to do a go-around' and land at a different runway to the one scheduled, but a problem with a wing flap saw the crew decide to head to Manchester for a 'longer runway.'

Following this decision, a series of errors were made, basic checks weren't carried out correctly, and the aeroplane's extra journey would have obviously brought the fuel down to a dangerous level. 

'Pilot type rating training as well as recurrent training is designed to ensure that pilots understand aircraft systems and are familiar with QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) checklists,' the report continues. 

'This crew had difficulty applying their knowledge in an unexpected situation and did not use the QRH correctly. The checklists should have been run to completion, despite the interruptions.

'The low and imbalanced fuel state which developed could have had serious implications,' adds the report.

A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines told Mail Online: 'As a result of the AAIB’s and our own internal investigation, we have completely reviewed pilot training for go-around manoeuvres to ensure operating procedures are accurately followed and when necessary low fuel levels are appropriately declared to air traffic control. The aircraft landed safely at Manchester Airport.

'At the time of the incident, proposed demotions were entirely due to the requirement to balance our number of captains and manage our costs in light of a significant surplus. 

'Due to the subsequent review of our fleet and new aircraft and routes, we have now been able to reverse almost all of the demotions ahead of 2015.'
