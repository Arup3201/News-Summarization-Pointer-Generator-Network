Tottenham have registered their interest in Marseille star Andre Ayew.

The forward is out of contract this summer and will be available on a free transfer at the end of the season.

And the player's representatives have now been made aware of Tottenham's interest.

However, Spurs are facing stiff competition in the race to land Ayew, with a host of Europe's leading clubs also on his case.

Inter Milan are understood to be leading the race to land the Ayew.

The 25-year-old fits into Mauricio Pochettino's plans to sign young and hungry players who can fit into his high-tempo style of play this summer.

Spurs are primarily targeting players who are 26 and under this summer, and Ayew falls into that category.
