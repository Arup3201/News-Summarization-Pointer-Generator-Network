Thomas Vermaelen’s stint as Arsenal’s club captain is close to an end with the Belgian defender destined for a move to Barcelona.

Few fans will miss the 28-year-old as a leader as injury problems coupled with a lack of form have seen him ousted from the starting line-up, let alone from his role as skipper.

But every Premier League challenger needs a leader, and in that respect the Gunners have a sizeable hole to fill. Here, Sportsmail looks as the possible candidates to replace Vermaelen this season.

On his way? Arsenal captain is set to leave the Emirates for Spanish giants Barcelona

MIKEL ARTETA

Would seem to be the logical choice after his vice-captain duties last season made him the go-to skipper in big games for Arsene Wenger, including the FA Cup final.

Doubts remain over the 32-year-old’s future at the club though, with his contract due to expire at the end of the 2014/15 season.

Supporters may doubt the Spaniard’s presence on the pitch too. Arteta is a man who keeps his cool in possession, but is hardly a grafter or a natural leader.

PER MERTESACKER

Searching for a presence? Well look no further. Standing at 6’7” the German World Cup winner demands respect.

Along with Arteta would be a sensible choice for Wenger, having stood in for Vermaelen and the Spaniard last season.

Commanding at the back, screaming instructions throughout the game, even idolising Tony Adams as a youngster; Mertesacker appears to be the best fit for the role in this squad.

BFG: Per Mertesacker returns to Arsenal as a World Cup winner and is not afraid to speak his mind

AARON RAMSEY

After a stellar breakthrough year last season Ramsey will be in Wenger’s thoughts when considering his options.

Having captained Wales in 2012, albeit at the wrong time for an out-of-form youngster, the 23-year-old has already been picked out as a future leader.

Can he fulfill that role at Arsenal? He’s a regular starter, popular in the dressing room and a perfect professional. Don’t rule him out...

Enter the dragon? Aaron Ramsey was Arsenal's most influential player before injury last season

JACK WILSHERE

Having progressed through the youth ranks Wilshere possesses the ‘Arsenal D.N.A’. However, after his recent antics he doesn’t quite fall under the role model category.

The father-of-two has been pictured smoking and partying in Las Vegas, while he has work to do to break back into this talented first XI after injury problems since his early promise. Wenger is certainly a fan of the Stevenage-born midfielder though.

‘Of course he will be one of the leaders of this club - in fact he is already on the pitch,’ Wenger said back in 2013. ‘I think Jack will be captain of this club this day - yes, of course.’

Time will tell.

Worth a risk? Arsene Wenger is an admirer of Jack Wilshere (L) but there are doubts over his lifestyle

LAURENT KOSCIELNY

Having been Arsenal’s most consistent player over the last two years, the French international automatically qualifies as a candidate.

Not a leader as such - instead doing his talking on the pitch - Koscielny has built up a formidable partnership with Mertesacker at the heart of defence.

French fancy? Defender Laurent Koscielny is a guaranteed starter but is not a born leader 

Honourable mentions

Wojciech Szczesny - A character, if nothing else. The selfie machine (along with Lukas Podolski) keeps spirits high in North London and has improved as a goalkeeper, but he must rank down the list.

Tomas Rosicky - Experience, professionalism, one of the manager’s favourites. Rosicky has stood in as captain on occasions but in truth doesn’t play often enough to merit the position.

Glove affair? Goalkeeper Wojiech Szczesny is popular in the dressing room but an outsider for the captaincy

Abou Diaby - The longest serving player in this current squad. He’s a regular starter, right?

Watch out for...

Calum Chambers - Wenger has high hopes for the 19-year-old, who in his little experience at the club so far can already be seen organising his new team-mates from the back.
