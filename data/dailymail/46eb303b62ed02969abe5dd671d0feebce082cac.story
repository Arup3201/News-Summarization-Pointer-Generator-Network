One in three homeless Big Issue sellers are now from eastern Europe, the founder has revealed.

John Bird, himself a former offender who lived on the streets, set up the publication in 1991 to help homeless people earn some money from selling the magazine.

But Mr Bird has revealed that less and less British people are now living rough and a third of vendors are now migrants from poorer European countries.

Of those, he said the majority are from Roma communities who are escaping lives of 'feral poverty' in their own countries.

But Mr Bird added that the Big Issue is still vital for helping the homeless make an income - wherever they may be from.

He told The Sunday Times: 'Don't slag The Big Issue off because we are working with east Europeans.

'What would you have them do? You are not going to offer them a legal job. Take the attitude the police have: thank God you have offered people who might have got into trouble the legal means to make money.'

Mr Bird also said he raised concerns when the Labour government first decided to open up freedom of movement in the UK to residents of other EU countries.

'I said, "Don't open the sluice gates to the ferally poor â€” go to their countries and help them earn their way into an economy which is more equal". But I was accused of being a fascist.'

Mr Bird's comments come as Nick Clegg has pledged to block any fresh attempts to curb immigration from the European Union.

The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed Home Office proposals for a 75,000 cap on EU migrants as 'pointless' and claimed without freedom of movement the National Health Service would 'fall over'.

His statement follows David Cameron's warning just a few days ago, that he would veto further expansion of the union's borders unless reforms were agreed to crack down on 'benefit tourism'.

A ban on EU migrants claiming out-of-work benefits from the moment they arrive in the UK is also being rushed through Parliament to be in place in time for the January 1 lifting of access restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals.

Migrants from all EU states will have to wait for three months before applying for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) and other out-of-work benefits.

Vital: Mr Bird added that the Big Issue is providing a vital service - giving homeless migrants one of the few legal ways to make an income
