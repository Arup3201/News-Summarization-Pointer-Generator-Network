A mother whose son died 18 years ago pickled him in alcohol and stashed his corpse in the basement where she has cared for him ever since... all so his son can learn to love him.

Tsiuri Kvaratskhelia keeps Joni Bakaradze's 
body entombed in a wooden coffin beneath the family home in 
Georgia, eastern Europe.

But despite having died in 1995, the 22-year-old has remained almost perfectly mummified, thanks to his mother's constant love and attention.

And every year on his birthday she has even given him a change of clothes - until four years ago when decay finally made the feat impossible.

Mummy's boy: Tsiuri Kvaratskhelia keeps Joni's body entombed in a wooden coffin beneath the family home in Georgia, eastern Europe

Good condition: Despite having died in 1995, the 22-year-old's body has remained in near-perfect condition thanks to his mother's constant care and attention

'He wanted his kid to see him that way,' she explained. 'I believe 
from that point on the kid started to love his father.'

There is also a little viewing window in the basement so family, friends and passers by can see how he's getting on.

Mrs Kvaratskhelia has learned more than a few tricks to keep her son presentable.

'One night I had a dream when a voice 
told me to treat Joni by rubbing alcohol so from then on I've being 
using wet sheets dipped in alcohol to preserve the body,' she said. 'You must not leave the body without the sheets overnight as the skin will turn black as charcoal.'

Explaining why she has not buried his body she explains: 'He wanted his kid to see him that way. I believe from that point on the kid started to love his father'

She added: 'For 10 years I've been changing his clothes on his birthday. Only the past four years I was unable to do so.

'He was a good man, a good husband, not the way he is now.'

But now Joni, whose cause of death remains unknown, is finally beginning to decompose since illness prevented Mrs Kvaratskhelia from giving him the daily care he needs.

'I was sick lately and could not tend to his body,' she said. 'That had an effect on him.

'My son is handsome. When I use the sheets his skin will be white again and everything will be normal.'
