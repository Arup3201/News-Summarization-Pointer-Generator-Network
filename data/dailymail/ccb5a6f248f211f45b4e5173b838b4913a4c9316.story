The presenter once revealed he had his ‘head in the sand’ when it came to saving doe his retirement. 

He told the financial website This Is Money in 2010: ‘[I’m] sort of vaguely hoping that whatever property I’ve managed to hang on to will somehow fund me and my family.

‘I wish I’d held on to the first property I bought. I just haven’t got a very relaxed attitude to debt. 

'I do have a pension, but I don’t really understand it and have been meaning to sort the flaming thing out every day for the past two years.’
