They had tried flashing signs, neon signs and staggered signs.

But when lorry drivers continued to keep on driving their over-sized trucks though low tunnels, Australian authorities took the extreme measure of warning drivers with water signs.

Drivers are greeted with a curtain of water falling from the entrance of tunnels with a huge 'stop' sign projected on to them.

Eyecatching! The curtain of water means that drivers cannot fail to notice the instruction

For those who disregard the standard warning signs, the virtual barrier can prevent them damaging their vehicle - and the tunnel

Officials used the drastic methods to stop drivers continuously smashing into the roads and causing delays and damage

The ghostly mirages have been adopted in Sydney after officials and motorist tired of drivers repeatedly driving into low-overhead tunnels that are too small for their vehicles.

The drastic measure was enforced after a string of incidents where lorry drivers caused huge traffic delays and damaged the structure of the bridges.

Drivers ignoring conventional signs now sit up and take notice of the Softstop virtual barriers created by Laservision, Jalopnik reported.

Clever technology creates the illusion 
of a solid sign, forcing the drivers to stop - but if they cannot halt 
in time, it won't have any physical impact on the vehicle.

A string of incidents forced frustrated officials to come up with a new way to avoid accidents

Tailbacks caused by tunnel-related accidents can affect up to 12,000 motorists during peak time

Authorities in Sydney hope devastating incidents like this will be avoided by the curtain - which will not damage vehicles if they do not stop in time

Laservision said that the Sydney Harbour Tunnel has experienced more than 10,000 incidents of vehicles hitting the structure since it opened.

The damage caused by too large vehicles crashing into the overhead of the tunnel affected up to 12,000 motorists at peak time, the company said.

This method means that the drivers avoid damaging their vehicles, cargo and road infrastructure, MSN reported.

A video shows just how effective the virtual barrier is.

A lorry can be seen heading towards a tunnel too low for it to be able to pass through.

The motorists passes by numerous overhead and roadside signs - some flashing, some simple neon signs - but all urging the driver to 'stop'.

It is only with metres to spare that the curtain of water descends, with a huge 'stop' sign beamed on to it - and the lorry finally stops.
