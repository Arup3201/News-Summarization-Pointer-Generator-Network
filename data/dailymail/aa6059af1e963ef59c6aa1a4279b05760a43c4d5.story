Celtic have completed a six month loan deal for Cardiff City’s £1.5million rated attacker Jo Inge Berget.

And the Norwegian international could be plunged into a Champions League baptism of fire in Warsaw on Wednesday night.

One of a raft of countryman signed by Cardiff’s Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January the 23-year-old failed to settle, managing just two appearances.

Signed: Jo Inge Berget has joined Celtic on loan from Cardiff after failing to impress Ole Gunnar Solskjaer

Well known to Parkhead coach Ronny Deila after a successful season on loan at Stromsgodset in 2010-11, however, Berget has been given a second chance in British football – penning a deal until January with an option to buy.

Berget will join the squad on this morning’s flight to Poland for the Champions League third qualifying round first leg clash with Legia Warsaw after beating last night’s signing deadline.

'I feel really happy, and I’m excited,' said Berget. 'It’s all happened pretty fast. I heard that the manager wanted me, so it was an easy decision for me. It’ s a good opportunity for me and hopefully it’s going to go well.

'I know Stefan Johansson, having played alongside him for Stromgodset before, and also for the national team, so I know him well. He’s a good lad and I’m glad he’s here at Celtic.

'It helps having one or two familiar faces, and it means I’ve got someone to speak a little Norwegian to as well.'

Shipped over: Berget was brought to England by Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January

Berget can play as a striker or a creative number 10 and fills the void created by Tony Watt’s £1.2million departure for Belgian club Standard Liege.

Insisting he is ready to go straight into Deila’s team against Legia tomorrow night he added: 'We started back at Cardiff around about the same time as Celtic so I’m ready to play.

'I’ll be travelling with the squad to Warsaw and I’m glad about that, and hopefully I can make an impression pretty soon. I’ll be ready for the game if the manager wants me.

'I’m an attacking player. I can play almost any role attacking-wise. I make things happen, I make goals happen and hopefully I can get the crowd going as well.'

An Udinese player for three seasons in his teenage years Berget spent a season on loan under Deila, who is credited with changing his career.

'I have some caps for the national team which will help when it comes to playing in Europe, and I’ve also played in the Europa League for Molde, so I’ve played in these sort of games before.'

Acquired: Ronny Deila's side face Legia Warsaw in a Champions League qualifier in Poland on Wednesday

Snapped up by Solskjaer’s Molde, the Manchester United legend signed him for Cardiff last January.

'I’m really pleased that we have been able to add Jo to our squad. I know his qualities and I am sure he can add something new to the team.

'He is a player who will work hard and give everything to the team. I hope he can enjoy a successful time at Celtic.'

Also on the Celtic flight to Warsaw as Deila stamps his mark on the club will be new first team coach Haakon Lunov.

Employed for his match analysis skills the 31-year-old worked with his countryman at Stromsgodset and also worked at Everton.

'I know Haakon well and I know the great work he will bring to Celtic,' said Deila.
