There’s nothing like the prospect of a new Tesco store to inspire a little healthy – and often heated – debate in a community.

However, things took a downright sinister turn in one town after locals had their say online.

Comments made on a blog run by one Tory councillor and on the Facebook page of another have been the subject of a criminal investigation.

Seaside town: Senior officers warned three Tory councillors they could be prosecuted for harassment during campaigning for a new Tesco in Margate, Kent (file picture)

Police even questioned a third councillor who merely ‘liked’ a post – the act of clicking a thumbs up icon to show approval.

Now senior officers have warned the three men they could be prosecuted for harassment over their involvement in  the debate.

One
 councillor accused Kent Police of acting like ‘North Korea’ and said 
their behaviour could stifle legitimate debate over other controversial 
proposals.

The inquiry was 
prompted after a bed and breakfast owner accused the men of targeting 
her over her outspoken opposition to the supermarket in Margate, Kent.

Councillor Dr Simon Moores, who was interviewed over comments made by 
third parties on his Thanet Life blog, could end up with a 
criminal record if he is prosecuted.

‘My fear 
is if members of the public start using criminal law to go after 
councillors because they disagree with something – then what is the 
point of public service?’ he said.

‘It
 is very Orwellian. Frankly it is like something out of North Korea 
because the police have yet to come to grips with social media.

‘There
 is the danger of veering on the heavy side when dealing with a 
complaint and not being able to clearly define where the law stands.’

Councillor: Dr Simon Moores, who has commented about the store in his blog Thanetlife, was questioned under caution for conspiracy to harass

The saga over the 82,000sq ft supermarket, a stone’s throw from the seafront, dates back several years.

The
 ‘yes’ campaign say it will bring jobs and revitalise the area, while 
those in the ‘no’ camp said it will damage the town’s revival and high 
street stores.

Progress 
came to a halt after an appeal was lodged at the High Court against a 
green light given by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles last year.

Entrepreneur
 Louise Oldfield, who also runs a B&B, complained she was being 
harassed over her persistent opposition to the plans.

She claimed she was the victim of online comments, some of which were made using pseudonyms.

Police
 visited Dr Moores, former Margate mayor Mick Tomlinson and a third 
councillor and interviewed them all under caution on suspicion of 
harassment.

They examined comments posted by third parties on Dr Moores’s blog.

These
 included claims Miss Oldfield had been ‘blinkered’ and referred to her 
‘humiliating’ defeat after she stood as an independent in a county 
council election.

Spirited: Rival Facebook groups supporting and opposing the supermarket have sprung up

Police 
also looked at the Facebook pages of Mr Tomlinson, on which he suggested
 Miss Oldfield exaggerated the size and position of the supermarket.

'It is very Orwellian. Frankly it is like something out of North Korea because the police have yet to come to grips with social media'

Councillor Dr Simon Moores

The third councillor, who has not been identified, was questioned after he ‘liked’ Mr Tomlinson’s post.

Dr
 Moores, a computer expert who has advised the National Crime Agency, 
said the inquiry is a ‘huge waste of police time and money’.

He
 said two inspectors have been assigned to the case and suggested a 
victim of robbery or assault was unlikely to receive similar attention.

He
 also believes the force took up the case only after Miss Oldfield 
directly appealed to Kent Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes – 
something she denies.

Miss 
Oldfield said: ‘Over the last two years I have felt many times that I 
have been unable to go out. It has been really distressing and I have 
had threats of assault.

‘For it to be portrayed that I have made a complaint about someone just because I am offended is ridiculous.’

A
 Kent Police spokesman said: ‘We are undertaking an inquiry into a claim
 of harassment and while that is ongoing we will not be making any 
further comment.’

If convicted of harassment, the councillors face a maximum of six months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to £5,000.
