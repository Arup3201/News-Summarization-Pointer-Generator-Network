It was a unique and groundbreaking experiment to show British television viewers the true effects of a jet disaster.

After four years of preparation a Boeing 727 was crashed into the Mexican desert - answering the question most consider when getting on a plane - where should someone sit to give themselves the best chance of survival.

And in a macabre twist, people logged into Facebook last night could 'check-in online', choose where they would have sat on the flight and after the terrifying collision, which ripped off the front of the jet in a cloud of sand, debris and twisted metal, they found out if they had died or survived.

The impact was pulled off deliberately for a documentary by the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 exploring the results of a 'serious, but survivable' crash-landing - producing incredible footage of its demise.

And its conclusion was that despite having the best seats and service on the plane, being in first or business class makes you less likely to survive a crash landing.

Groundbreaking: With its fuselage ripped in two, the deliberate crash-landing of this Boeing 727 in the Mexican desert shows just how devastating such an impact can have. The collision was filmed for a documentary and subjected to scientific tests in an effort to further understand 'serious, but survivable' crashes and improve safety

Wrecked: The experiment was designed to study the crash-worthiness of the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of such disasters on the human body

They flew the Boeing over a remote part of desert before allowing it to smash 
into the ground. On this occasion the jet, which can carry up to 170 passengers, contained only crash-test dummies and dozens of interior cameras to film the sequence.

A pilot had earlier flown the jet out to a Mexican desert and jumped out before the aircraft was remotely crashed into the ground.

The experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash-worthiness of the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on the human body.

It is the first time in almost 30 years a passenger plane has been crashed on purpose for a scientific experiment. The last time was in 1984 when NASA teamed up with the FAA to crash a Boeing 720 into the Mojave Desert in California, USA.

Online check-in: People watching with access to the internet could log in via Facebook and choose their seat on the ill-fated flight

Going down: The Boeing 727, which can normally carry 170 passengers, plunges into the ground in a remote-controlled descent moments after the pilot ejects

Amateur footage of the crash shows the plane heading into the desert floor while a helicopter flies alongside with a film crew.

The latest experiment is expected to 
give a better insight into a crash landing thanks to the benefit of 
improved filming and remote control technology. The show is the result 
of four years' work by London-based TV company Dragonfly Film and 
Television Productions.

Sanjay Singhal, executive producer of the documentary, said: 'We felt the time was right to do it again.

'It
has never been safer to fly, but we want to use this as an opportunity 
to provide scientific data that might help to improve passenger safety 
in those extremely rare cases when a catastrophic aircraft accident does
occur.

'This has been an 
extraordinary feat of organisation, involving up to 300 people on 
location, including the production team, pilots, experts, risk 
management, plus local crew, military, fire teams and police.'

The plane was crashed in a remote and
unpopulated part of the Sonoran Desert of Baja California, Mexico. The 
location was chosen after an extensive international search to find a 
suitable location offering the perfect conditions for this 
ground-breaking scientific project.

First for 30 years: The aircraft, which was loaded with crash-test dummies and cameras, sends sand and debris shooting into the air as it careers into the desert floor

For safety reasons, an exclusion zone at the crash site was manned by security teams, as well as the Mexican military and police. Ahead of the crash, a full safety review of the project was undertaken by the highly-qualified pilots and commanders as well as the Mexican authorities which concluded that it was safe for all concerned.

Following the crash, the aircraft will be salvaged and an extensive environmental clean-up operation is being carried out by a reputable agency with the full co-operation of the Mexican authorities.

David Glover, Channel 4 senior commissioning editor, added: 'This is a ground-breaking project, allowing a team of leading international scientists and crash investigators the first chance for a generation to study the crash of an entire passenger jet.

'The scientists are also looking at passenger safety, plus new 'black box' flight data recording technology.

'They have been hugely enthusiastic supporters of the project and couldn't wait to get to the crash site. Despite long careers, none of them have seen a plane crash before their eyes like this before.

'We hope that this documentary will provide valuable new scientific results as well as giving passengers vital information about how they can improve their own chances of surviving the extremely unlikely, but frightening, prospect of being in a serious plane crash.'
