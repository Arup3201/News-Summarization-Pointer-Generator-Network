England players have been ordered not to stoke up the dispute over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands after intense provocation by Argentina’s players ahead of the World Cup.

Alejandro Sabella’s team held up an inflammatory banner – Las Malvinas son Argentinas (the Falklands are ours) – before a 2-0 win over Slovenia on Saturday. They will be fined by FIFA because political slogans are forbidden.

Now the FA have banned England’s players from discussing the conflict. After England’s 0-0 draw with Honduras here, the FA told every member of staff: ‘Don’t answer questions on (the) Falklands.’

Message: Argentina players held up a banner saying 'The Falklands are Argentine' before their 2-0 friendly win over Slovenia on Saturday

Settling in: England's players arrived at the Golden Tulip hotel in Rio on Sunday after flying from Miami

The message was part of a briefing, written on a giant flip chart, to the players in the dressing room.

Although England are not in the same group as Argentina at the World Cup, they could face each other in the latter stages.

Argentina continue to dispute the sovereignty of the islands, which lie around 1,200 miles east of Buenos Aires, and have started another political campaign after Britain began drilling for oil in the area.

Only four England players — Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Phil Jagielka and Rickie Lambert — were alive during the initial conflict in the early 1980s. Just under 1,000 military personnel from both countries and three Islanders died during the fighting.

On Sunday, England were dealing with another matter after assistant manager Gary Neville was accused of telling a cameraman to ‘f*** off’ during a walk in Rio de Janeiro.

According to FA sources, Neville finally snapped after being followed for around a mile by a persistent cameraman just hours after the England squad arrived in Brazil for the World Cup.
