A man was tortured in a terrifying 'trick or treat' robbery on Halloween.

Two men wearing 'Scream' masks and armed with a knife and an axe shouted 'trick or treat' outside a Bedford flat before barging inside and carrying out a violent robbery.

Inside they bound a 26-year-old man with tape and then tortured by being cut on his head, his legs and face to make the woman who lived at the property, hand over money.

Grange Road: The man was tortured so the woman inside the Bedford flat would hand over cash she had from selling a car

Scream: The masks, made popular by the Scream film series, were worn by two robbers who tortured a man for money

They also stole two iPhones.

Bedfordshire Police say the robbery happened at about 9.30 pm on Thursday evening at the flat in Grange Road.

Detectives have described the attackers as two Asian men.

They were wearing dark clothes and hoodies as well as the Halloween masks.

Police said the 24-year-old woman had money in the flat after recently selling her car.

Police say they will not be disclosing how much cash was taken but are looking at the possibility the attackers knew there was cash in the house.

Det Con Mike Armstrong, said the two attackers would have been noticeable as they would have been considerably taller than most trick or treaters out on Thursday.

He said: 'The injuries to the man are very nasty and obviously this was a very frightening incident for both people involved.

'Officers have made extensive searches, forensic examinations and knocked on doors in the area, but there are bound to be people who were around at the time that we haven't yet spoken to.'

The two men left the block of flats on foot but police are still trying to establish which direction they went after that.

It is possible they got into a car parked further up the road or in a nearby street.

The distinctive masks, worn by the killer in the popular Scream film series, are white and are usually worn with a black hood and cloak.

American slasher films, Scream, are based around murderers that dress up as the character to stalk their victims.

The four films have broke box office records when they came out in the late nineties and star Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Bedfordshire Police on 101.
