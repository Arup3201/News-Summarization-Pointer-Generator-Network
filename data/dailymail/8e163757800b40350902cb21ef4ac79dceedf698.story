In an age where looking picture-perfect in an Instagram selfie is all the rage (thanks, Kim Kardashian), it comes as no surprise that women are brushing up on their beauty techniques.

However, rather than devouring beauty manuals or picking up tips from their mothers, two fifths of British women are now watching their way to better beauty skills.

A recent survey  revealed that 41 per cent of women view beauty videos on YouTube or dedicated blogs - an industry that's garnered 700m hits a month worldwide, according to Pixability.

YSL make-up artists will treat customers to a 45-minute makeover while wearing the Google Glasses and filming their every brush stroke so that customers can replay the close-up tutorial at home

But with a new year comes new trends and beauty bloggers like Zoella and Lisa Eldridge may find their viewing figures dwindling.

Taking heed of the popularity of online make-up and skincare tutorials, French style giant YSL is helping beauty buffs create their own personal tutorials with the help of Google Glass.

Make-up artists in store across the UK will treat customers to a 45-minute makeover while wearing the Google Glasses and filming their every brush stroke. 

The make-up artist will take before and after pictures on the glasses and  wear them throughout the entire make-up application to capture the techniques and products used.

The resulting video will be seen through the eyes of the professional and is designed to help customers recreate the look when they return home.

The bespoke tutorial, which costs £30 and is redeemable against product purchase, is emailed to you within 20 minutes of being filmed, along with before and after shots.

The concept has just launched in Selfridges, London, and will be being rolled out nationwide in 2015. 

This isn't the first time that the smart specs have been used in the beauty realm.

In February this year, Max Factor's lead make-up artist, Mel Arter, created a raw nude look for the Emilia Wickstead show using the computerised eyewhere.

Mel told MailOnline at the time: 'Being backstage is an exciting time for a make-up artist. It’s a prime opportunity to get really creative and use the latest products for the first time.

'By using Google Glass this season, you’ll be able to see exactly how I’m creating the look; a make-up artist view on camera that has not been seen before.

'Women can then follow this process and create all or parts of the look themselves at home.

'I think we are going to be seeing them a lot more in the world of make-up artistry. I am chuffed to be pioneering it.'
