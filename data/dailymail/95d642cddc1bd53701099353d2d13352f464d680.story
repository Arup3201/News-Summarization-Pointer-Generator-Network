A hospital's smallest surviving premature baby has defied the odds to make it home for Christmas after her older sister 'asked Santa' to make it happen.

Amber-May Bass weighed less than 1lb when she was born 15 weeks early on August 3 - lighter than a large tin of beans, which weighs around 1.1lbs.

But the premature baby has since made a good recovery and is well enough to spend the festive period with her family - granting her six-year-old sister Jenna-Rose's Christmas wish.

Their proud mother, Nikkie Palmer, 34, of Stowmarket, Suffolk, said: 'We are just so excited about Christmas now after getting Amber-May back home with us. Even just the build-up to it.

'Having Amber-May home and all that - it's so exciting.'

Ms Palmer revealed that in their darkest moments she and her partner Andrew Bass, 27, feared the family would never spend Christmas Day together.

Amber-May was born by emergency Caesarean section at West Suffolk Hospital, in Bury St Edmunds. Ms Palmer said it was 'absolutely amazing' to have her daughter home in time to celebrate Christmas.

She revealed that Jenna-Rose had asked Father Christmas to bring her new sibling home for the festive holidays.

'I really thought this Christmas would never come because we didn't expect her home really before the New Year,' said Ms Palmer. Friends and family have been absolutely amazing.

'They have all helped out with picking up Jenna-Rose from school and taking her to school.'

Ms Palmer said the family would not have coped without the support of their friends and family. 'We have a great support network with everybody,' she said.

Amber-May now weighs in at a healthy 5lb 11oz and has been gaining weight gradually. 'She's settled into her feeding routine and everything now, said Ms Palmer.

Jane and Graham Ackinclose from Newcastle had a set of triplets who were born at just 29 weeks in November (pictured). Yet each still weighed more than double that of tiny Amber at birth

The festive period is going to be a family affair with Christmas dinner at Ms Palmer's mother's house and Boxing Day at Mr Bass's parents' home.

Dr Ian Evans, consultant paediatrician at West Suffolk Hospital, said: 'Amber-May isn't the most premature baby we've cared for at West Suffolk, but as far as I'm aware she's the smallest who has survived.

'We are really pleased with the progress she has made, especially as she was so tiny when she was born.'
