A 21-year-old North Carolina college student who refuses to let the loss of her left leg deter her from playing soccer is inspiring Boston Bombing amputee victims.

When Bree McMahon was a high school senior, she had already earned a scholarship to play soccer in college.

But four years ago when her best friend accidentally struck her with a car, her life changed drastically.

Passion: Bree McMahon, 21, got a scholarship to play soccer in college when she was a senior in high school, but then she lost her left leg. It didn't stop her from pursuing her love for soccer

Will power: McMahon was undeterred by the loss of her leg and started training after the accident in 2009

Determination: The high school senior decided to learn how to walk with a prosthetic leg after she lost her left leg

‘I immediately forgave her, because it was an accident,’ says McMahon of her friend, Chelsea Lingelbach.

‘That was very important, to know that she didn’t hold it against me, she didn’t have hatred in her heart,’ says Lingelbach. 

Even with only one leg, McMahon was undeterred and did everything she could to learn how to walk with a prosthetic. She says the soccer field is where she belongs.

‘I'll admit it, I'm hard-headed,’ she told Today News.

‘I knew what I wanted, and I was going to chase after it with everything I had.’

Save! McMahon worked hard to be accepted on a college soccer team and use her scholarship. She is now the goalie at North Carolina's Brevard College

Before the accident: McMahon was a star soccer player in high school when she was suddenly struck by a car and lost her leg

Brevard College in North Carolina 
honored McMahon’s scholarship, and she joined the soccer team, 
eventually playing as goalie with her prosthetic leg.

McMahon’s inspirational tale has touched the lives of other amputees.

After the Boston Marathon bombing in April, McMahon spoke to survivors, including Roseann Sdoia, who lost her right leg.

Sdoia said McMahon was ‘truly an inspiration’.

According to McMahon’s mother, Kathleen McMahon, her daughter was able to show survivors of physical trauma that ‘recovery is 99 per cent choice and 1 per cent chance’.

Not everyone believed McMahon would 
compete again, and her mother said that most people thought they were 
‘delusional’ when the family swore she’d return to the field.

But Kathleen never doubted her daughter's will power and determination.

‘Seriously, you don’t know our daughter,’ she said.

McMahon says she is grateful for every moment she’s earned on the field.

‘You never know how much you truly appreciate something till it's been taken away from you,’ she said.

‘And so you just try your hardest to get back what you've lost, and that's what I do with soccer.’
