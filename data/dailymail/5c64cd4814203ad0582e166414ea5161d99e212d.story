Polite society: Mr Selfridge star Jeremy Piven has put the success of period dramas down to viewers hankering for a simpler life before mobile phones and the internet

The star of popular ITV series Mr Selfridge has put the success of period dramas down to viewers hankering for a simpler life before mobile phones and the internet.

Actor Jeremy Piven, who plays American entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge in the hit show, says audiences enjoy the programme, and others such as Downton Abbey or Call The Midwife, because they depict life before text messaging and the availability of electronic gadgets.

Mr Selfridge, which returned last night for a second series set on the eve of the First World War, portrays a society where customers are greeted by name as they walk into the famous department store, and men still stand when a woman enters the room.

The show is set at a time when Londoners still relied on telephone, telegraph, radio and even carrier pigeon, to converse.

‘It’s just a simpler time when people really had to 
communicate with each other and they could not hide behind text messages
 or email,’ Mr Piven told The Lady magazine.

‘Maybe we’re all longing for that.'

Three-time Emmy winner Mr
 Piven also told the magazine that viewers more used to wearing 
tracksuits than top hats and tails, enjoy seeing the pristine outfits 
put together by the characters as they hit Selfridges to stock up on 
intricate feathered hats and gloves.

In last night's programme Mr Selfridge, despite being something of a serial womaniser himself, was seen chastising new arrival Lord Loxley for not behaving like a 'gentleman' towards his wife Lady Mae.

'Everyone 
put so much time into their appearance then, too. People now are a lot 
more casual,' said Mr Piven, who found global fame playing foul-mouthed Hollywood agent Ari Gold in HBO series Entourage.

‘Also, I think, Harry really believed in putting on a
 show, and that exists in Selfridges to this day. It doesn’t necessarily
 apply everywhere, and that’s too bad.’

Mr Selfridge has proved a hit with viewers, with nine million viewers tuning in for the first episode of series one, while more than 11 miilion are hooked on Downton Abbey.

Creator Julian Fellowes, whose show is set between 1912 and 1923, backed up Mr Piven's observations about the programmes harking back to a simpler time.

The 64-year-old has previously lamented the lost manners of a bygone age where 'most men would stand when a woman walked into a room', according to The Times.

'I do agree that there does seem to be an appeal from an apparently simpler and more straightforward lost world,' he said.

However, Lord Fellowes added that the era depicted in Downton Abbey was also blighted by high levels of infant mortality, poor living conditions for many people, and limited medical resources - as well as the First World War, in which nearly a million Britons lost their lives.

He suggested that going back in time via a television show is a 'safer option'.
