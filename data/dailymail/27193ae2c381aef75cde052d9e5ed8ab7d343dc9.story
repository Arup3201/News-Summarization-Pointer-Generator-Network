He may have fallen out with Jose Mourinho, but former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o is still extremely popular with fans around the world.

The Cameroon captain, who departed Stamford Bridge at the end of the season after his one-year deal expired, hit out at Chelsea boss Mourinho last month over comments about his age and fitness.

But the 33-year-old seemed in good health, and good spirits, as he waved to adoring fans and joked with his teammates at Cameroon training on Tuesday.

The Indomitable Lions squad have only recently arrived in Brazil after a dispute over bonus payments.

Eto'o and his team had threatened to go on strike before the World Cup, but eventually came to an agreement and arrived in Brazil on Monday

They begin their campaign against Mexico on Friday, before facing Croatia and hosts Brazil in Group A.
