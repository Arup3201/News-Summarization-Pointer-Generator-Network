Whatever she wears turns to gold, and even a week after returning from the royal tour of New Zealand and Australia, the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe choices are still sending shoppers into a frenzy.

Website eBay has seen a 95 per cent rise in sales of yellow dresses - a summery hue Kate championed twice during the 19-day trip. Arriving in sunny Sydney wearing a striking, canary-yellow pencil dress by Roksanda Ilincic, Kate looked every inch the immaculate fashionista - and nothing like a banana, whatever the Duke of Cambridge might have thought.

Four days later, Kate was pictured in a pastel number she designed herself for Easter Sunday at Taronga Zoo with William and George, causing the total sales of yellow dresses on the UK site to almost double.

Kate is not alone in her fondness for the citrus shade - Susanna Reid was pictured in a lemon yellow frock for Good Morning Britain, while Hollywood sweetheart Emma Stone wore a vivid full-length yellow gown to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 premiere in London last week.

The sunny hue 
was very much in evidence at fashion week, in eye-catching shades of sherbet, 
buttercup or lemon.

Turkish-born Bora Aksu 
unveiled a collection with a pretty palette of bright zesty yellow, as 
did Jasper Conran.

Wearing a sunshine yellow dress with muted make-up and 
slicked back hair for maximum effect was the advice of many designers and beauty gurus backstage at the AW14 shows.

In addition, sales of both floral (up 94 per cent) and green dresses ( up 88 per cent) spiked hugely overnight from the moment Kate was pictured wearing these styles during the tour.

An eBay spokesperson said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge’s wardrobe undeniably affects what’s in when it comes to style-hunting on eBay, with sales consistently skyrocketing after she is photographed in the latest trend.'
