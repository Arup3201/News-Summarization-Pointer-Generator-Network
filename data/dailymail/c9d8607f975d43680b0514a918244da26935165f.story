She may have showcased an enviably toned physique on the Victoria's Secret catwalk but Alessandra Ambrosio insists she loves eating chocolate and crisps.

The model, who has two children, Anja, six, and Noah, two, with fiancé Jamie Mazur, admits she has a sweet tooth and loves snacking on junk food.

The 33-year-old Brazilian beauty said: 'I like to have Lay's salt and vinegar chips and a Toblerone bar in my Gucci tote. I'm obsessed! And I share them with my kids.'

The star also loves drinking tea to help her relax ahead of her appearances on the runway.

She said: 'I drink Two Leaves and a Bud chamomile tea when I wake up, during the day and before I go to sleep. When I travel, I make sure they're with me.'

The star also opened up her handbag to reveal her favourite beauty buys. She said: 'There's so much in my Longchamp makeup bag! I have shimmer lip balm by Rodin, nipple pasties and RMS Beauty's Lip2Cheek, which you can use as a blush or red lipstick.

'I bring my Fujifilm Instax camera with me everywhere. I love taking shots of my kids. And the photos print right away!'
