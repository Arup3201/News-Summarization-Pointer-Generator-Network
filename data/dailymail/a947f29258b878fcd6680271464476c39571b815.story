It's been ravaged by fire, the roof's caved in, the windows are boarded up and the grass goes past your kneecaps. 

'It's totally messed up inside,' adds real estate agent Lee Guo. And this abandoned fibro premises in Western Sydney is all yours for $750,000.

The high price of this abandoned South Granville property - a likely knock-down - could be another sign of the high prices that are locking first home buyers out of the market, analysts said.  

This home in South Granville, in western Sydney, is for sale with an asking price of $740,000

The roof has caved in, the windows are boarded up, the grass goes past your knees - and there's a spare mattress out the front

If it stays standing, the home would need some work. The interior devastated by a blaze years ago, Mr Guo said.

'It's been burnt. Other things have been broken or missing. You know, even the tiles on the wall, they are all broken,' he said. 'I don't think you can really live inside it.'

'No one (has) lived inside for at least five years. If someone really wants to buy that property probably they have to knock the old house down.'

But while the home may be a shambles, the property does have its perks. The squalid home sits on a considerable tract of land - at 570sqm - and it has a 22m frontage. 

Mr Guo's online advertisement suggested it could be developed to construct a duplex or to 'build your dream home'. 

The home sits on a considerable 570sqm block of land under R3 zoning, which the real estate agent said is a rare opportunity

The property is located just a short drive from the nearby bustling Parramatta CBD and is just a five minute walk from nearby primary schools. 

It's unlikely first home buyers will be flipping open their chequebooks, though, going by the experts. 

Brian Haratsis, the executive chairman of Macroplan Australia, said: 'Clearly western Sydney is no longer a place for first home buyers.'
