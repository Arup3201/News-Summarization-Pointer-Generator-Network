Former jump jockey Graham Bradley says it is ‘outrageous’ of the BHA to suggest he does not feel remorse for previous disciplinary breaches as racing’s ruling body sent out a clear signal that they will continue to oppose him becoming a trainer.

Details emerged on Tuesday of the case in which Bradley was found not guilty of operating as an ‘unlicensed trainer’ controlling his own horses while working for Lambourn trainer Brendan Powell.

But the disciplinary panel flagged up ‘disturbing features’ that ‘may be found relevant by the Licencing Committee when it comes to decide upon Bradley’s training licence application.

These included a ‘failure to recognise the seriousness of the misconduct which led to his disqualifications'.

Bradley remains a hugely controversial figure who polarises opinion within the sport because of the five-year ban he received from the Jockey Club in 2002 for receiving money for tips from Brian Wright, a man subsequently sent to jail for 30 years after being exposed as one of Britain’s biggest drug dealers.

But he says it is wrong to suggest he does not regret his past misdemeanors.

Bradley said: ‘I had unreservedly apologised and said it on a number of occasions. They are obviously not believing the sincerity of my apology.

‘They seem to believe everyone else. I have been promised lots of horses from big owners and I want them to let me get on with my life. I can’t believe they don’t think I am remorseful for what I did in the past. Of course, I am.

‘I have publically said I am sorry and wrote them letters.’

Bradley lodged an application to train in May 2013.

The latest investigation, involving 12 horses which ran in 116 races and picked up 19 wins between October 2012 and May 2014, heard that Bradley had directly charged owners training fees and raceday expenses as well as taking a share of Powell’s prize money.

But the panel, while conceding it was a ‘close run thing’ it concluded that Powell made the entries for the horses and supervised their work regimes – enough for the BHA not to have proven their case.

BHA spokesman Robin Mounsey said: ‘We note that the Panel had significant concerns with Bradley’s conduct, which will be considered when determining his suitability to hold a licence.’

While plenty will applaud the BHA sticking to its hard line, Bradley has been found not guilty of the latest charge.

Having this year granted jockey Fergal Lynch, who was banned for admitting he stopped a horse, a licence to ride, to continue to obstruct Bradley, who has paid the price for his misdemeanors, is a questionable line of action.
