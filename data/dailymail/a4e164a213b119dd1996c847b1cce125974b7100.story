Would you fancy your chances in the ring against David Haye, Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world? I foolishly thought I should give it a go last Sunday at his Hayemaker Gym in Vauxhall, London.

Me vs David Haye. Mano a mano.

Most fighters would have at least three months preparation for a fight, I had scarcely three hours sleep the night before and was looking a bit worse for wear.

It had been a heavy night. A couple of friends had come in from New York and wanted to be shown London’s night-life.

We started off with drinks at the Sanctum Soho Hotel and then on to hot new West End club Chakana.

At the club we bumped into an old friend Caggie Dunlop and the promises I’d made to myself that I would have a quiet one prior to my Sunday morning boxing session were evaporating fast.

To make things worse I had broken my nose only the day before. A girl had accidentally elbowed me in the face (she said it was an accident and I’ll have to take her word for it), but she connected with such force that blood was streaming from the bridge of my nose and the bone was chipped.

So picture if you will, the look on the former WBA Heavyweight Champion’s face as I’m telling him to go easy on me because a girl broke my nose recently and I’ve got a bit of a hangover.

I asked if we could forego the boxing session and just do some photos together to publicise his new gym and boxing training sessions, he said no.

The only thing I could do to make things better was to pop a Forza T5 Super Strength capsule to give me some extra energy and concentration before I went into the ring.

I was given a quick lesson by David’s trainers Ruben Tabares and Peter Marcasciano on how to jab, hook and throw some combinations when in the ring with David. The tuition came in handy but it didn't prepare me for David's imposing presence and intense stare, just holding a punch pad in one hand he looked menacing.

Spencer gears up to take on David Haye

Spencer asked David if he could forego the boxing session as he had a bit of a hangover. David said no.

David held up a hand for me and asked me to punch it as hard as I could. He moved his hand away long before my punch went anywhere close. I was nowhere near fast enough.

Following some supervision and guidance from David I started to improve and got into the swing of things and threw some good right hooks into the pad but after about ten minutes I started to realise that the fitness levels needed for boxing are off the hook. As I bent over out of breath David laughed and gave me a playful kick on the backside.

I gained some confidence as the session went on and at one point in the video you can see me starting to get a bit cocky and I even faced off with David (one minute six seconds in) – like I would stand a chance if he launched a punch back.

Spencer advises having a nice early night before you contemplate going to the Hayemaker Gym

This is a great work-out, and also a great lesson in self-defence for both men and women – and there were several women at the session that morning.

The Hayemaker training camp provides two hour elite training and conditioning sessions to the general public at affordable prices. It also gives members of the public the opportunity to train with, and use the same facilities as former WBA Champion David Haye.

My only advice is to have a nice early night before you contemplate going.

The sessions are open to all from age 14+ regardless of fitness levels. For more information, please visit www.hayemakertrainingcamp.com or email hayemaker@geniusbrand.co.uk for direct bookings.
