Nigel Farage yesterday floated the idea of Conservative candidates standing on a joint Tory-UKIP ticket at next year’s general election.

He suggested that there are some Tory Eurosceptics who would be open to the idea because they support a Euro referendum and wish to avoid splitting the centre-right vote in 2015.

Standing for two parties at once was authorised for the first time under a change to the law quietly pushed through early last year.

Nigel Farage yesterday floated the idea of Conservative candidates standing on a joint Tory-UKIP ticket at next year's general election. Nadine Dorries was the first MP to go public and say she would consider it

At the time, it was speculated that MPs might want to stand for the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats under a joint ‘Coalition’ ticket.

But this was dismissed by both parties, and the idea is now being invoked by Ukip as a way to stand jointly with MPs of any party who want to leave Europe.

Eurosceptic Mid Bedfordshire MP Nadine Dorries was the first to go public and say she would consider standing on a joint Ukip-Tory ticket at the next election.

The law – the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013 - allows candidates to stand jointly for two parties with a single logo on the ballot paper.

It was enacted, the government claimed at the time, to allow Labour MPs who are also members of the Co-operative Party to use either the Labour logo or the specially created Labour Co-op logo, as under the old rules they could not use either.

Some Tories were suspicious it was an attempt to allow coalition ministers to stand for both parties – an idea which now seems highly unlikely.

Any MP seeking a joint ticket would need the blessing of their party. A Tory party source said: ‘There is absolutely no question of anyone standing on a joint ticket with Ukip. We wouldn’t allow it.’
