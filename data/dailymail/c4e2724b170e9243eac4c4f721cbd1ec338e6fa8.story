A Tigerair flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore was delayed on Thursday after flight attendants were thought to have spotted a severed finger on board.

While cleaning the plane, a crew member found what was believed to be a human finger and immediately alerted airport security.

Upon inspection, it turned out that the finger was not actually severed at all, but a prosthetic.

However, the incident was alarming enough to delay the aircraft for two hours on the runway in Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia.

'The flight was delayed as airport authorities carried out checks when a prosthetic finger was discovered on board during a routine transit cabin inspection,' a Tigerair spokesperson told MailOnline Travel. 

The airline also said that the flight did eventually arrive safely in Singapore at 8:28pm on Thursday, two hours and 20 minutes behind schedule.

'The matter has been handed over to the Malaysian authorities for investigation and follow up,' the spokesperson added.
