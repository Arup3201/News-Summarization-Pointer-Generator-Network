MailOnline readers have captured wintery scenes from around the country today after much of Britain was covered in snow overnight when temperatures plummeted to -11C.

Forecasters have warned of up to four inches of snow over the next two days along the east coast, where there is the possibility of more snow in the south and south east on Friday.

While the sudden flurries may have caught some drivers unawares, with accidents and tailbacks widely reported on Britain's roads this morning, that has not stopped MailOnline viewers from venturing out to capture some snaps of the snow.

Emma Davies sent in an image of her two children Alexander and Paige getting a ride to school on a sled in Weston Turville, Buckinghamshire, while Sarah Chisholm took a picture of her daughter Grace, 9, with a miniature snowman in their garden in Romford, Essex.

Others turned to nature for inspiration, sending in images of snowy fields and white woods, while Melissa Ayton-Minton managed to capture a robin sitting on a park bench in Woking, Surrey.

The Met Office said today that sub-zero temperatures will continue overnight tonight, and may stick around for the next five days. An easterly wind blowing in from Europe on Friday will bring biting cold to the south, with the mercury dropping to -4C with windchill.
