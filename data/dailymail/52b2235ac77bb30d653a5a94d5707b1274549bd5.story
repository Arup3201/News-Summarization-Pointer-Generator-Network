Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to lead his party to the next election, saying the success of his best ministers owes much to the team's 'captain'.

Mr Abbott was responding to reports senior government MPs have given him until the second half of 2015 to improve his performance or risk losing his job.

Coalition MPs have publicly and privately criticised Mr Abbott in recent weeks, with his decision to award a knighthood to Prince Philip seen by some as the last straw in a series of poor decisions.

Asked whether he would lead the coalition to the 2016 election, Mr Abbott said: 'Absolutely.'

Quizzed further about the higher popularity ratings of Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Malcolm Turnbull, Mr Abbott said he was thrilled to have such strong colleagues.

'One of the reasons why so many members of the team are able to perform so well is because they have got a very good captain,' said Mr Abbott, who was visiting a dairy farm in the regional Victorian city of Colac on Friday.

'It takes a good captain to help all the players of a team to excel.'

Facing criticism he is out of touch with the community, Mr Abbott said he kept in contact by dropping in on cafes while going on his regular bike rides. 

'Most weekends I'm in local cafes - admittedly dressed in lycra riding with the local cycling group,' he told reporters.

Mr Abbott, pictured on his bike, even described himself as a Middle Aged Man In Lycra - a 'MAMIL'

'Tomorrow, in Geelong, I will be participating in the Cadel Evans ride and I’ll be mixing with hundreds, if not thousands, of other people and I'm sure along the way I’ll be stopping at a cafe along with the other ‘Mamils,’ as I believe we are described. 

Treasurer Joe Hockey, who visited a construction site in western Sydney, said MPs were entitled to their views on the government's fortunes.

'But I would just say to people, we do not want to become a carbon copy of a bad Labor government, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government,' Mr Hockey said.
