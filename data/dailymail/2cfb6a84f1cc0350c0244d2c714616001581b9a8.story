Shocking surveillance video shows the moment a 67-year-old Utah mother of three unknowingly drank a toxic cup of iced tea and spend nearly two weeks unable to speak because of lye poisoning.

The footage shows Jan Harding sweetening her iced tea at Dickey's Barbeque in South Jordan, a Salt Lake City suburb, and taking a single sip of the beverage on Aug. 10.

She immediately notices something is wrong, hunching over a trash can and barfing the remains of her drink. 

A fellow customer and a store manager stop by to check on her, but she continues to throw up.

Harding, 67, has been recovering at home since she was released from University of Utah Hospital on Aug. 20, some 10 days after she was rushed there with lye poisoning.

She remained unable to speak for the duration of her stay at the hospital.

 Authorities have said a restaurant employee unintentionally put the heavy-duty cleaner lye in a sugar bag, and another worker mistakenly mixed it into the iced tea dispenser. Lye, which looks like sugar, is an odorless chemical used for degreasing deep fryers. 

Jan Harding, a mother of three, was the first one to drink from the chemically laced batch of tea. No one one else was harmed. 

She has been recovering with her family at home after making progress at the hospital that is 'nothing short of miraculous,' said Paxton Gyumon, Harding's family attorney.

Harding must still undergo tests and procedures to determine any long-term complications, Guymon said.

'The family sincerely appreciates all of the support and prayers from everyone who has followed her story,' he said.

Harding has been slowly improving since the incident, when the industrial cleaning solution lye mixed into the tea and caused deep, ulcerated burns in Harding's esophagus.

The victim's husband, Jim Harding, says he is focused on his wife's recovery and not lawsuits

Attorney Paxton Guymon, who represents the Harding family, says another woman person was also poisoned with lye at the restaurant in July

Her husband, Jim Harding, has said that his wife has had nightmares about the moment that made her say, 'I think I drank acid.'

Jim Harding, 66, said he's focused on his wife's recovery and not criminal charges or lawsuits.

Salt Lake County prosecutors are reviewing a police investigation and have not announced if charges will be filed.

The Dallas-based Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has said the incident was isolated and unprecedented in the chain's 73-year history.

Guyman has recently said that he discovered another lye incident at the South Jordan restaurant in July. An employee there burned herself when she stuck her finger in a sugar container and licked it to test for the chemical cleaner, he said.

The employee's tongue began bleeding and blistering. She quit on Aug. 9, the day before Harding was burned, Guymon said.

Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants has not commented on the new allegations.
