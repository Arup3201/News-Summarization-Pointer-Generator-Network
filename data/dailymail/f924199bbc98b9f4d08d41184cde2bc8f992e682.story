Food stamps will be handed to the poorest and neediest when cash handouts are scrapped in favour of vouchers next week.

Many local authorities are expected to take part in the scheme under which vouchers will be issued to the most vulnerable, rather than cash grants or loans.

They will be issued to help tide people over in times of financial crisis, and recipients will be able to exchange the vouchers for food, nappies and other essentials, but not alcohol or cigarettes.

Thousands of the most vulnerable people will be given vouchers redeemable for food and essentials from April

The voucher scheme is being introduced from 1 April under changes to benefits outlined in last year's Welfare Reform Act.

The food stamps will replace the discretionary part of the government-run Social Fund, which issued immediate, small cash grants and loans to people on low or no incomes who needed help urgently.

Now, instead of the money being handed out by central government, it is being devolved to local authorities in England and devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales.

The current budget of £178.2m will be handed down to a local level, plus start-up costs of £72m, for councils to spend as they see fit.

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the move was not about cost-cutting, as there was no reduction in budget, but rather was intended to ensure the money was spent where it was most needed.

He said: 'We’re reforming the Social Fund because it is complex, over-centralised and poorly targeted, and replacing it with local provision to ensure this money goes to those most in need.

'We will transfer the current annual funding for crisis loans and community care grants to local authorities in England and the devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland.

'They will receive the full programme budget of £178.2 million a year in addition to administration and start-up costs of over £72 million which represents a fair settlement.'

The vouchers will be adopted in the wake of the abolition of the Social Fund's discretionary scheme, under which the needy were given crisis loans, repayable out of their benefits, or community care grants.

Local authorities may offer vouchers redeemable at supermarkets, food banks, or those that may be exchanged for hot meals

The Social Fund's regulated scheme, which governs cold weather payments, Sure Start maternity grants, funeral expenses and the Winter Fuel Grant, will be unaffected, the DWP says.

It will be up to the local authorities how they spend the money, but many of those in England are said to have confirmed their plans to issue one-off, single-use vouchers to those who apply for emergency assistance.

Some authorities are planning to hand
 out food parcels, and will divert extra funds to local food banks to 
enable them to buy more supplies and take on more staff to help.

And others may issue the money as repayable loans, similar to the crisis loans available under the previous system.

Bath and North East Somerset council is one authority planning to offer vouchers, and a spokesman told MailOnline the council intends to use their allocation to offer a mixture of vouchers and discretionary payments.

Spokesman James Hinchcliffe said: 'These may be supermarket vouchers or electricity or gas vouchers, or they may be Discretionary Support payments, for example to help with housing payments or essential household items.'

A spokesman for Newcastle City Council said it was also planning to offer a mixture of clothing and fuel vouchers, food parcels, and emergency travel costs.

Critics said the scheme may stigmatise those already in trouble, but the Government insists the plans, which will enable local authorities to set their own eligibility criteria, will mean the money will go where it is needed most.
