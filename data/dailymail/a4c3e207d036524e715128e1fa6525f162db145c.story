The number of people in the UK infected with HIV has reached an all-time high, new figures show.

Nearly 110,000 are living with the condition, but around a quarter are unaware they have it.

They are therefore at risk of passing on the virus to others through unprotected sex, experts warn. 

The figures, from Public Health England (PHE), have been released ahead of National HIV Testing Week.

They show that overall, more people are being diagnosed earlier. The proportion of people diagnosed with a late stage of HIV infection fell from 57 per cent in 2004 to 42 per cent in 2013.

Meanwhile, around six per cent of gay and bisexual men are now living with HIV.

This rises to 13 per cent in London - meaning that one in eight sexually active gay men now has the condition.

In 2013, 3,250 men were newly diagnosed - an all-time annual high. 

It is estimated that over 7,000 gay men have an HIV infection that remains undiagnosed and that an estimated 2,800 men acquired HIV in 2013.

Doctors say these figures highlight the need to increase both the numbers and frequency of HIV tests, which is critical to tackling the ongoing high levels of HIV transmission.

In a statement, Public Health England (PHE) said: 'While the large majority of black Africans do not have the HIV infection, the report also draws attention to the fact that one-third of the 40,000 black African heterosexual men and women living with HIV in the UK do not know they have HIV.'

Dr Valerie Delpech, head of PHE's national HIV surveillance, said: 'We can’t overstate the importance of testing for HIV to ensure an early diagnosis.

Early diagnosis of HIV enables better treatment outcomes and reduces the risk of onward transmission.

To get a test...

Go to an open access STI clinic (some clinics in large cities are offering ‘fast-track’ HIV testing) or go to a community testing site.

Ask your GP for an HIV test – nowadays there is no need for lengthy discussion about the test, it just involves having blood taken, or even a finger prick.

Ask online for a self-sampling kit. 

'People diagnosed promptly with HIV infection can expect to live long and healthy lives. 

'However in 2013, people diagnosed with HIV late were 10 times more likely to die in the first year of diagnosis compared to those diagnosed promptly. 

'People who remain unaware of their infection are also at risk of transmitting HIV to others.

'Knowing HIV status is the key to both effective treatment, and to preventing onward transmission'.

As a result, PHE is encouraging people most at risk to take an HIV test. 

This includes gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men and black Africans in particular.

Professor Noel Gill, head of the HIV & STI department, said: 'Used correctly and consistently, condoms remain an inexpensive and effective way to prevent HIV. 

'We are also now seeing important and exciting data on ways to use antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV.' 

PHE has also issued advice on safer sexual behaviour to reduce the risk of HIV.

Get tested regularly for HIV if you are one of those most-at-risk:

* Men who have sex with men are advised to have an HIV and STI screen at least annually, and every three months if having unprotected sex with new or casual partners.

* Black African men and women are advised to have an HIV test and a regular HIV and STI screen if having unprotected sex with new or casual partners.

* Always use a condom correctly and consistently, and until all partners have had a sexual health screen.

*Reduce the number of sexual partners and avoid overlapping sexual relationships.

* Unprotected sex with partners believed to be of the same HIV status (serosorting) is unsafe. For the HIV positive, there is a high risk of acquiring other STIs and hepatitis. 

For the HIV negative, there is a high risk of HIV transmission as well as of acquiring STIs and hepatitis.
