A man faces court for allegedly flying  a drone over several Premier League football grounds as well as London landmarks including the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace.

Nigel Wilson of Nottingham, has been summoned in relation to 17 breaches of the Air Navigation Order, Scotland Yard said on Wednesday.

All of the incidents reportedly took place last year – with 15 occurring in September and one each in October and December.

Four of the football stadia-related charges refer to Liverpool's Anfield, three to Derby County’s Pride Park, two each to Leicester City’s King Power stadium and Nottingham Forest’s City ground, and one each to Manchester City’s Etihad stadium, Arsenal’s Emirates stadium and Stoke City’s Britannia ground.

The north London derby  in September is understood to be one of the games that the drone was flown over

He is also alleged to have failed to maintain direct, unaided and visual contact with a drone at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster.

A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: 'We can confirm that we have assisted the police in preparing this prosecution.

'There are clear rules and regulations in place regarding the flying of drones in the UK and it is the responsibility of users to spend time fully understanding what those rules are.'

Drones, like the one pictured, are not allowed to be flown over gatherings of more than 1,000 people

The fixtures that Nigel Wilson is accused of flying a drone over are: 

Liverpool v Aston Villa on September 13 at Anfield

Liverpool v Ludogorets on September 16 at Anfield

Nottingham Forest v Fulham on September 17 at the City Ground

Derby County v Reading on September 23 at Pride Park

Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur on September 27 at the Emirates Stadium

Stoke City v Newcastle United on September 29 at the Britannia Stadium

Derby County v Bournemouth on September 30 at Pride Park

Leicester City v Liverpool on December 2 at the King Power Stadium

He will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday, April 16. 

The Civil Aviation Authority has previously issued a warning over the use of drones after footage was posted online. 

A CAA spokesman said: 'The rule is that you're not allowed to fly over large gatherings of people of 1,000 or more at any height.

'You're not allowed to go within 50 metres of a building or structure. It's not something that people can just do without permission for safety reasons.

'These [drones] can weigh up to seven or eight kilograms. They could create a bit of damage if they fall from 1,000 feet.'

The CAA has already prosecuted two people over illegal drone flying.

Wilson is also accused of flying near London landmarks including the Palace of Westminster (pictured)
