He told an US gossip site that he had no knowledge of Justin Theroux's proposal to his daughter Jennifer Aniston.

But now it appears that John Aniston was simply trying to play dumb to avoid spilling any details.

A spokesperson for Jennifer told MailOnline: 'John did know about the engagement but did not know when we would go public with the information so when he was caught off guard on the phone he did not want to be tricked into giving out any information that was not cleared by Jennifer and Justin.'

As news broke Celebbuzz.com asked the Days of Our Lives actor, 79, his thoughts on the proposal.

He has Jen's best interests at heart: John Aniston claimed he didn't know anything about his daughter's engagement to Justin Theroux but he was simply playing dumb

John said: 
'It’s the first I’ve heard about it. It’s a surprise to me. I’ll have to
look online. When I find out more, I guess I’ll tell you!'

When it was explained that Theroux 
proposed to Jennifer on his birthday while they were on the set of her 
new film We're the Millers on August 10, Jon didn't reveal he knew about the proposal and said: 'It sounds very 
romantic.'

The American soap star has described Theroux as a 'charming young man', and 
gave his seal of approval saying, 'I think they make a wonderful 
couple.'

Meanwhile, Radar Online are reporting that Jen's mother, Nancy Dow, only heard about her daughter's good news when it was confirmed to the press.

Engaged! Jennifer Aniston agreed to marry Justin Theroux on his 41st birthday last Friday

Starter marriage: Brad Pitt with Jennifer in September 2004 - four months before they split after five years of marriage

Mother and daughter became estranged after Nancy penned a tell all memoir in 1999 but started to reconcile after Jennifer's 2005 split from Brad Pitt.

She and Justin visited her mother in hospital last year after she suffered a stroke, and despite hearing the news second hand, Nancy is said to whole-heartedly approve.

The happy news that the
Friends actress and her actor/director beau sealed the deal on Friday, 
after the 41-year-old popped the question during his birthday 
celebrations, broke over the weekend.

His spokesperson confirmed to People:
'Justin Theroux had an amazing birthday on Friday, receiving an 
extraordinary gift when his girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston, accepted his 
proposal of marriage.'

'They're great friends,' the spokesperson added - a cheeky reference to the sitcom that made Aniston famous in the Nineties.

The engagement news comes on the weekend rumours swirled that Jennifer's ex-husband Brad Pitt set to be marry Angelina, his partner of seven years and the mother of his six children,  at their French home.

Their romance was infamously shrouded in whispers that they embarked on a relationship while Brad was still married to Jennifer - having met on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith in 2004.

However, as news of the wedding has still not been confirmed and insiders are claiming that next weekend is 'a far more likely date', Jennifer and Justin have stolen their thunder.

The couple, who have been dating for more than a year, were first seen together in May 2011.

Just two months later, Jen placed her
Beverly Hills mansion on the market for $38m, before buying a palatial 
LA Bel-Air home with Justin in January of this year - for a reported 
$22m.

Jennifer and Justin 
both starred in Wanderlust together, a comedy flop with Paul Rudd about a
modern New York couple trying to escape society by moving to a commune 
in Georgia.

Fans will be elated for Jennifer, as the Los Angeles native was largely considered to be unlucky-in-love.

Following
her four and a half year marriage to Pitt, which saw them separate in 
January 2005, she endured a string of fling flops.

Aniston was seen on the arm of The Break-Up co-star Vince Vaughn soon after, before moving on to British model Paul Sculfor for a few months in 2007 and later had an on/off romance with John Mayer.

Meanwhile, Theroux fell under the 
microscope during his courting of Aniston - as he broke up with his 
long-term girlfriend of 14 years, Heidi Bivens.

The well-respected fashion stylist, who has worked at Details and Vogue, was said to be 'blindsided' by his actions.

However, she seems to be moving on, 
having been hired for costume designer duties on the new Selena Gomez 
and Vanessa Hudgens film Spring Breakers.

But it seems Jennifer certainly made 
Justin sweat, reportedly turning down his initial proposal in June 
during a romantic European jaunt in Paris and Rome.

And in an interview with GQ Spain, she said she no longer strives for the perfect life as it's 'cliché'.

Asked if it bothers her that her 
personal life is under constant scrutiny, she said: 'A perfect life? I 
think that’s sort of cliché, isn’t it?

'Like, if you want to be happy, you should have the house, the husband, the kid... Kids are messy!'
