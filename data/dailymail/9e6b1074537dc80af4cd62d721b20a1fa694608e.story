Nicola Adams guaranteed a Commonwealth medal to add to her collection after easing into the women’s flyweight semi-finals.

A unanimous verdict over Erandi de Silva of Sri Lanka did not tell the whole story as London 2012 gold medallist Adams dominated the contest, landing crashing hooks with both hands. A left had De Silva in trouble and Adams went on to land punches at will. She now faces Mandy Bujold of Canada.

Adams said: ‘Everything went to plan. If you stick to the tactics and listen to the coaches you will always do well. She was a game fighter, she never gave up. Everybody wants to be the new Nicola Adams. Everybody wants to beat me and take the No 1 spot.
