England’s plans to draft in Manu Tuilagi for the RBS 6 Nations have been dealt a new blow with the Leicester centre facing a delay in his recovery from injury.

The 23-year-old was expected to return to club action before the new year, but Sportsmail understands his comeback has now been rescheduled for mid-January.

It leaves little time for Tuilagi to prove his fitness before the Six Nations kick-off against Wales on February 6, with England head coach Stuart Lancaster expected to name his squad early next month.

Speaking in the first week of December, Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill stressed the importance of Tuilagi to the national team’s ambitions, saying: ‘Manu has been huge for England.

'Hopefully, he will be fit and playing come Christmas time and he will be back into the England squad for the Six Nations.

‘When England have played at their best, Manu has been at his best.’

Tuilagi has been sidelined since October, when he suffered a groin injury during Leicester’s Champions Cup victory over Ulster. 

The East Midlands club have missed his physical presence, although Japan international Christian Loamanu could return to fill in against Bath on Sunday after starting on Monday for the club’s reserves.

The delay is unwelcome news for Lancaster, who sees Tuilagi as the missing piece in England’s midfield after a below-par autumn international series.

South Africa-born Brad Barritt kept the No 13 jersey warm during the November Tests but he offers nowhere near as much potency in attack.

Tuilagi’s physicality sets him apart from his compatriots. England have tended to back sizeable midfielders including Barritt, Luther Burrell and Billy Twelvetrees over lighter options such as Jonathan Joseph, Henry Slade and Kyle Eastmond — and few come more sizable than Tuilagi.

Code-switcher Sam Burgess has been seen as an outside option to bulk up England’s midfield but is unlikely to be given an international debut during the Six Nations. 

The Bath star is still undecided on his best position, having featured at both inside centre and back row.

On Monday night Burgess started at blindside flanker for Bath’s reserves in an A League fixture against Exeter at Sandy Park. 

He lined up against Exeter’s England international Tom Johnson, making his first start in more than six months.

Johnson had neck surgery in October and had not played since England’s 20-15 defeat by New Zealand in June. But the Chiefs forward has been in training for three weeks and could make a late charge into Lancaster’s plans.

He may return to Aviva Premiership action this weekend, though Exeter coaches are unlikely to rush him straight into the starting XV. 

The Devon club have suffered two consecutive defeats, but will be favourites when they face Gloucester at home on Saturday. 

Cherry and Whites scrum-half Greig Laidlaw remains optimistic, despite his side failing to gel after a summer of intensive recruitment.

‘Some boys feel the pressure but you need to go the other way, train hard, train well and improve your skill set,’ said Laidlaw.

‘I truly believe we have the players here and the coaching staff to be able to do that.

‘Sometimes it is hard to remain positive but you have to. You need to be strong-minded and back your skill set.

'That is the attitude we have to take into a tough game at Exeter. The season is not finished.’
