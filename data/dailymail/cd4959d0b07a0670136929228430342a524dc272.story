Seven-year-old Daniel Barden had one hope for when he grew up: To be a firefighter like his uncles.

But while the youngster's future was tragically cut short when he became one of Adam Lanza's 26 victims in the Sandy Hook massacre on Friday, his dreams have not been forgotten.

In a heart-wrenching display of kindness and remembrance on Wednesday morning, firefighters from as far as New York City attended the young boy's funeral in Newtown to pay their respects.

As Daniel's parents, brother and sister arrived at St. Rose of Lima Church at 10am, the firefighters somberly formed an honour guard along the road, silently offering support to the heartbroken family.

The youngster's funeral is the latest in the long, almost unbearable string of services for the innocent victims of the killings.

Four children - Jessica Rekos, James Mattioli, Jack Pinto and Noah Pozner, all 6 - have already been remembered and on Wednesday, two more children - Charolette Bacon and Caroline Previdi, both 6 - and a teacher - Vicki Soto, 27 - will also be laid to rest.

On Wednesday morning, mourners swarmed the church to pay their respects to Daniel, who was remembered as an imaginative and outgoing first grader who loved spending time with his family.

His family described how he loved playing sports, and was on the Newtown soccer and swimming teams. He also enjoyed playing drums in a band with his brother James, 12, and sister Natalie, 10.

In a statement after his death, Daniel Barden's family paid tribute to the popular, loving child.

'Everyone who has ever met Daniel remembers and loves him,' they said in a statement. 'Words really cannot express what a special boy Daniel was. Such a light. Always smiling, unfailingly polite, incredibly affectionate, fair and so thoughtful towards others, imaginative in play, both intelligent and articulate in conversation: in all, a constant source of laughter and joy.

'Daniel was fearless in his pursuit of happiness and life. He earned his ripped jeans and missing two front teeth.

'Despite that, he was, as his mother said, "Just So Good." He embodied everything that is wholesome and innocent in the world.

'Our hearts break over losing him and for the many other families suffering loss.'

In an interview with ABC's Katie Couric earlier this week, his parents explained that Daniel had manners far beyond his years and was 'adored and admired by all' who knew him.

'Our neighbours always said, "Heâ€™s like an old soul",' his mother Jackie Barden said.

'He would hold doors open for adults all the time,' his father, Mark Barden, added.

He continued: 'Our son had so much love to give to this world, and he was supposed to 
have a whole lifetime of bringing that light to the world. All of us have suffered a loss because that won't be realised.'

After the funeral, Daniel will be buried at St. Rose Cemetery on Cherry Street.

On Wednesday, his fellow students, Charolette Bacon
and Caroline Previdi, both 6, will also be remembered, while the 
funeral for his teacher, Victoria Soto, is already underway.

Soto, 27, has been hailed a hero for 
trying to save children from the gunman at Sandy Hook last week, 
shielding them with her body.

She is believed to have hid the youngsters in her classroom closet before confronting Adam Lanza, telling
them the children were at the other end of the school.

Sadness: On Tuesday night, mourners gather for the wake of Charolette Bacon. She will be laid to rest today

Six children panicked and tried to escape but the teacher put herself in
the line of fire so she could save them, but they were all shot 
multiple times.

At
a wake for Soto on Tuesday, hundreds of mourners stood in a line that 
wrapped around a funeral home in nearby Stratford, while others sobbed 
as they left the building.

On Wednesday, her sister Carlee 
sobbed as she left the funeral. An image of Carlee howling in pain as 
she learned her sister had been murdered on Friday came to represent the
horror of the killings.

Since Victoria's death, parents have 
paid tribute to the caring teacher. The parents of victim Dylan Hockley 
said the young woman was  'warm and funny' and Dylan 'loved her dearly'.

Victim: Victoria Soto, a first-grade teacher who heroically tried to save the children, will also be laid to rest

At 1pm, a funeral will also be held for Charolette Bacon, 'an extraordinarily gifted six year old' whose parents said 'filled her family each day with joy and love'.

'The family will forever remember her
beautiful smile, her energy for life, and the unique way she expressed 
her individuality usually with the color pink,' the said in a statement.

'Charolette never met and animal she didn't love, and since the age of two wanted to be a Veterinarian.'

A
Mass of Christian Burial for Caroline Previdi, who loved drawing and 
dancing, will be held at noon at St. Rose of Lima Church, where most of 
the funerals for the children have been held.

'Caroline Phoebe Previdi was a 
blessing from God and brought joy to everyone she touched,' her parents,
Jeff and Sandy Previdi, said. 'We know that she is looking down on us 
from Heaven.'
