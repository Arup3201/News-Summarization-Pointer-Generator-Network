A Catholic priest fed up with mobiles constantly ringing and beeping during his sermons has installed a jamming device to stop phones from going off.

Father Michele Madonna  found his services in Naples, Italy, were constantly interrupted by jingling incoming calls and buzzing text alerts.

He had an engineer fix the £40 device inside the Santa Maria di Montesanto church  after receiving approval from the local police.

Father Michele Madonna finally flipped after he found his services in Naples, Italy, were constantly interrupted by jingling incoming calls and buzzing text alerts

But now local businesses are asking for him to remove it as they claim it blocks contact card cash devices in their stores.

Father Madonna said: 'I had put signs up asking people to switch off their phones after having services disrupted.

'Phones were always going off during Mass and at other events like funerals which just wasn't on.

'What really annoyed me is that when it first started people would switch off their phones in embarrassment now they are cupping their hands over the receiver and carrying on talking.

'I bought the jammer from a local electrical store and asked the police if it was OK and they said it was - it's great as it has stopped the problem but some of the local shops aren't happy.'

One shop owner said: 'Since Father Madonna started using the jammer I've had real problems using my card swiper for payments.

'It just doesn't work and I'm losing money. Others are in the same position - I understand how he feels but what about us? This is our busiest time of the year.'
