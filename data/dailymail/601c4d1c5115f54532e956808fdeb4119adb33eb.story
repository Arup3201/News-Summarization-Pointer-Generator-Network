It's a heartache commonly faced by millions of pet owners - taking your beloved dog to the vets to say a final goodbye before having him put down.

But an Indiana film-maker has perfectly captured the emotions felt by dog lovers facing their trauma of losing an animal in an emotionally charged two minute clip.

Chris Neal filmed his father Todd describing the moment the family dog, Griffey, was put to sleep after he developed tumours and was struggling to stand up.Â

Set against old footage of the dog chasing rabbits and playing with Todd's children over the years, 'Man's Best Friend' sees him tell the camera that he had been meaning to have the dog put to sleep for a while, but had been putting it off.

He is heard to say: 'We were talking to the vet about how long it would take and he said it would be a matter of seconds. Just then I was thinking "just stop and we'll take him home".

'You could see him pass away which was just really unreal, the end of an era.

'He was best friend. He's always there, he's always happy, he's always wagging his tail.

'When I was sick, he was really the one thing I had. He helped me through.'

Todd describes how Griffey was a normal puppy and that his children loved to play with him and torment him as youngsters do.

He adds that one of Griffey's favourite games was to chase rabbits around the family back garden, though he would never catch them.

Neal, 22, used music that he composed himself as the clip's score and took much of the footage for the film from old VHS tapes.
