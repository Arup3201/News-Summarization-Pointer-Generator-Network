If Mario Balotelli put as much effort into being a success at Liverpool as he did avoiding the dog in his latest Instagram post the striker would currently be celebrating a trip to Wembley. 

But he doesn't, and he was yet again blasted on Sunday as Liverpool failed to get past a determined Blackburn Rovers at Anfield Stadium, putting a potential Wembley trip on hold.

It seems the Italian striker has returned to Italy for a few days following the stalemate as the striker is seen  at the boxing gym of fighter Leone Petrosyan, who is based in Milan.

On lookers find it rather amusing but the former Manchester City striker is keen to get away from the pooch

The 24-year-old striker is seen running from Petrosyan's dog, ducking under ropes and hiding in the ring as the pooch is urged to give him the runaround.

Getting the runaround at the hands of Balotelli  is certainly not something opposing defenders have had to deal with too much this season.

Balotelli has scored just four goals in 24 games this season following his £16million arrival in the summer as a replacement for Luis Suarez.
