A top economist says Labour leader Ed Miliband's plan to cap energy bills will cripple the UK's energy infrastructure

Ed Miliband’s pledge to freeze energy prices has been savaged by the leader of the world’s most influential economic group.

Angel Gurria, of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, says it will destroy investment in the energy infrastructure needed to keep the lights on.

Mr Miliband said in September that he will freeze energy prices for 20 months if Labour wins the general election in 2015.

The commitment is credited with keeping his party high in the opinion polls, although new research claims it has wiped billions off the value of shares in energy firms.

But Mr Gurria says a freeze on bills takes no account of the fluctuating international cost of energy.

In an interview with BBC Panorama tonight, he says some energy firms could be left bankrupt by the plan, which would deter investors just when Britain needs more energy infrastructure.

He adds: ‘If you freeze the price of energy and the international price of energy rises it means there’s going to be a very big difference to pay. Who’s going to pay the difference? Are you going to ask the investors to take the difference?

‘They’ll probably go bankrupt. How are you going to get people to come in and invest to get their money back in 30, 40 years’ time, when you are saying there’s going to be a freeze?

‘I think this is simply not consistent, not economically objective.’ The investment bank Liberum Capital said yesterday that £6.7billion has been wiped off energy shares in Britain since Mr Miliband pledged on September 24 to freeze bills.

It said that if Britain’s listed utility companies had kept pace with similar firms in Europe, their value would be around £11billion higher now.

The chief executive of Npower said 
that Britain needs new energy infrastructure because the country could 
soon be close to an energy shortfall, raising the spectre of blackouts.

Paul
Massara said: ‘The amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down
from about 15 per cent to this winter when we’ll be about 5 per cent. 
Next winter will be even smaller.

The leadership of Ed Miliband has been ‘a considerable gift to the Tory party’, Labour peer Lord Puttnam said yesterday.

The film producer said the Labour leader’s brother David would have given the Government ‘a much tougher time’.

He accused Mr Miliband of beating David to the position with a ‘bloc vote’ by trade unions – and said he lacked experience.

Lord Puttnam spoke out as it emerged Ed Miliband is seeking advice from Blairite big hitters.

A leaked memo shows he consults Alastair Campbell every month, and Blairite ‘ultra’ Alan Milburn every six weeks.

Others to be consulted include: former Mandelson aides Ben Wegg-Prosser and Patrick Loughran; Blair press officer Matthew Doyle; and adviser DJ Collins.

‘So will we get through this winter? Yes. Will we get through next winter? I don’t know.’

EDF boss Vincent de Rivaz also called for ‘massive’ infrastructure investment.

Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint said excess energy company profits had pushed customer bills too high, and the price freeze was necessary.

She added: ‘The public have been overcharged. Wholesale prices dropped substantially in 2009. That was never reflected in a pass on to consumers. There’s been a distortion ever since.’

But Mr Massara said it was unfair to criticise the profits of the so-called Big Six energy firms. ‘In 2012 we made about a 3.5 per cent margin,’ he said. ‘That is hardly excessive. Unfortunately... suppliers are the easiest thing to shoot at.

Warnings of an energy shortfall came as Sir Mark Walport, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, said shale gas could produce new energy but create less carbon dioxide than coal, adding: ‘It’s a better fuel. As part of a fuel mix to a low-carbon future, it’s a sensible thing to do.’

Meanwhile, Cuadrilla, the firm fracking for shale gas, yesterday said it had found enough in Lancashire to fuel Britain for 50 years. Company boss Allan Campbell compared the potential to that of North Sea oil and pledged that the public in fracking areas would benefit to the tune of billions of pounds.

He added: ‘There is so much gas that we can give the supernormal profits to the people it belongs to – the people of Britain. We want to give away billions.’
