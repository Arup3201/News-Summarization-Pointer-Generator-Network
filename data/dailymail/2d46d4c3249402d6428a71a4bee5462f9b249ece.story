A married senior insurance broker and junior employee who were caught having an office affair are understood to no longer work at the firm where their sex romp was filmed by pub patrons from across the road.

The 50-year-old regional manager and the 25-year-old woman are no longer employees at the Marsh Ltd insurance firm in Christchurch and have not returned since the incident on January 30 made international headlines,The New Zealand Herald reports.

However it is understood that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees, a source told The New Zealand Herald.

An employment investigation was instigated following the scandal and all parties are now prohibited from speaking due to a confidentiality agreement. 

It comes after reports that the man, who is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter, was fighting to keep his job while appearing to live at home alone, according to The New Zealand Herald. It is still unclear if his wife is standing by him.

The steamy encounter between the two took place in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action.

Video footage and photographs taken by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide.

Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man's wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook.

The 25-year-old junior office employee involved in the scandal is understood to also be avoiding attention and has since moved from her home.

Her fiancé spoke to a local radio station following the event to defend his former partner, revealing they had ended their relationship six months earlier, according to The New Zealand Herald.

Last month the Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the man's brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved.

'When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,' the friend said.

'After he didn't reply he even asked, 'It's not you is it?' He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.'

When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager's house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions.

The man was revealed as a husband and father of two. His wife found out about the incident after she saw it on Facebook
