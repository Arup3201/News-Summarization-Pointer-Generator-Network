A Northern California woman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to multiple road-rage charges before asking the judge to set her bail at $100, all the while grimacing and gesticulating wildly in court.

Dierdre Orozco, 50, is accused of trying to run two young women off I-80 north of Sacramento Saturday. 

Days earlier, she had been arrested and released because of another road-rage incident.

All smiles: Dierdre Orozco, 50, was grinning in court Tuesday as she pleaded guilty to a slew of charges in connection to two separate road rage incident

The victims of Saturday's event filmed Orozco yelling and honking as she swerved her huge silver Ford Explorer Sport Trac pickup truck into the women's tiny Mazda.

At one point, the dramatic video shows Orozco pulling her car in front of the victims — forcing them to stop — and claiming to be a highway deputy.

Orozco, of Santa Clara, was charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of false imprisonment, unlawful use of a badge, reckless driving and resisting arrest.

At her initial court appearance Tuesday, the woman sat in her red jail garb flashing smiles and making odd gestures.

KCRA cameras inside the courtroom captured the moment Orozco pretended to steer a wheel, made the horns gesture with her hand and pretended to smoke a joint and take a swig out of an imaginary bottle.

Orozco's bail was initially set at $250,000, but the figure did not sit well with the woman.

As the prosecutor was asking to raise the amount to $500,000, Orozco chimed in, asking the judge to 'put it at $100.'

After spending the hearing pulling faces and playing with her hands, Orozco finally got a chance to speak, telling the court she would like her case to be handled in 'the most expeditious way.'

The four people involved in the two separate road-rage incidents have sought a restraining orders against Orozco.

The Highway Patrol said the Saturday incident began after Mazda passenger Delanie Strykul made a rude gesture because Orozco’s Ford Explorer had been tailgating. 

Strykul said the woman cut them off twice, then slowed down to drive alongside their car.

'When she did that, I threw up my hands and flipped her off,' Strykul told CBS Sacramento. 

That got Orozco enraged, said Strykul and her companion, who 'feared for their lives.' 

'She pulls in front of us and then pulls her car horizontal and stops us,' Strykul told CBS.

The young woman frantically called the California Highway Patrol while keeping her phone camera rolling, recording the confrontation.

‘She just hit our car. She just hit our car. She's pushing us off of the road. Yes, she's pushing us off the road. She's coming for us,’ Strykul tells a CHP dispatcher on the video, her voice shaking. ‘Please help us.’

The video shows the Explorer forcing their Mazda onto the shoulder as the Mazda's driver screams.

‘I could not believe this was real. I was sitting there going, 'This has to be a joke," Strykul told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 

At one point, Orozco emerges from her truck and repeatedly knocks on Strykul's window and flashes an ID card claiming to work in law enforcement.  

Investigators said the badge was actually an ID card for a national chain of senior centers called Visiting Angels.

The young women manage to pull away — but Orozco gets back in the truck and begins to follow them.

'She did the whole zig-zag in three lanes with her flashers on, kind of like what a police officer would do if they were trying to slow down traffic,' Strykul told CBS.

They eventually were directed to an interstate exit where a highway patrolman was waiting to make the arrest. 

Five days earlier, Orozco had been arrested for an alleged hit-and-run in nearby Roseville.

After the accident, police told the Auburn Journal, Orozco proceeded to drive to her friends’ house where she threw rocks through the windows, vandalizing the home and threatening to kill the people inside.
