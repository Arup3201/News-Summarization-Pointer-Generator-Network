The Ministry of Justice has suspended a prison meat supplier after it was discovered that Halal pies and pasties may have contained traces of pork DNA.

The meat had been sourced from a properly Halal certificated caterer, however an investigation showed that the products could have contained traces of non-Halal meat, including pork.

The consumption of pork is forbidden under Islamic law, and all of the contaminated products have been withdrawn with immediate effect, the Ministry said.

Chopped: Meat supplied to prisons by a Halal caterer (not pictured) may have contained traces of pork DNA. The meat is not supplied by butchers such as this man as it is forbidden under Islamic law

The scandal comes in the wake of traces of horse DNA being found in burgers on sale to the public.

As a result major food retailers and suppliers have been summoned to an urgent meeting following the spate of mis-labelled or contaminated food products reaching families.

Yesterday the Food Standards Agency (FSA) ordered food companies to a conference on Monday following a number of recent cases that
 have shaken consumer confidence in food labelling.

'People have a right to expect that the food they are eating is correctly described,' said a spokesman.

'It is the responsibility of food businesses to ensure the food they 
sell contains what it says on the label.

Slammed: Justice minister Jeremy Wright has labelled the scandal over Halal prison food as 'unacceptable', and said that the Prison Service would investigate

'We are considering, with 
relevant local authorities, whether legal action is appropriate 
following the investigation.'

The meeting has been organised to establish what has been happening, and what the next steps should be.

The Prison Service has also launched an investigation after a number of Halal meat pies 
and pasties supplied to jails were found to contain traces of pork DNA.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said that following the discovery of non-Halal meat and the traces of pork, all prisons had been informed, as well as the FSA, before steps were taken to suspend the relevant supplier, which has not been named.

'All prisons have been informed about this very regrettable 
incident and we reported this issue to the Food Standards Agency 
immediately," he said.

'We are taking immediate steps to suspend the contract with the relevant subcontractor.'

The FSA added that the local authority where the supplier is based was investigating how the contamination came about and whether products have been distributed elsewhere in the UK.

Justice minister Jeremy Wright slammed the prison food scandal and offered his support to those affected by the blunder.

'This is an absolutely unacceptable situation, and one which we regret greatly,' he said.

'Clearly this must be distressing for those affected and they can be reassured we are doing everything we can to resolve the situation.

'The Prison Service is investigating this as a matter of urgency.'

The Prison Reform Trust said that it welcomed the immediate apology and investigation.

Director Juliet Lyon said: 'This is not a matter of dietary preference but of Islamic law.

'There are clear hospital and prison rules that Halal meat must be on the menu.

Admitted: Burger King says it had  been selling burgers containing horse DNA and had dropped the Irish supplier Silvercrest, which also supplied Tesco, Asda and The Co-Op

'This
 lapse will have offended and distressed high numbers of Muslim 
prisoners and their families so apologising, suspending the supplier and
 investigating the incident are the right steps for the Ministry of 
Justice to take.'

The revelation follows the recent scandal over horsemeat contamination.

On
 Thursday Burger King admitted that it had been selling burgers 
containing horsemeat andÂ  dropped the Irish food processing plant which 
had supplied the products contaminated with horse DNA.

The contaminated burgers were made by the Irish-based processing company, Silvercrest, which is part of the ABP Foods Group.

The same company also made tainted burgers for Tesco, Asda and the Co-op, among others.

Dropped: Tesco, Aldi and the 'Co-op' have dropped Irish supplier Silvercrest Foods after horse was DNA found in frozen burgers produced at the plant

Aldi
 said that a sample of its frozen Oakhurst Beefburgers showed up 
positive for 0.1per cent horse DNA, while its Oakhurst Beef Quarter 
Pounders were 0.1per cent equine and 0.1per cent pork.

The company withdrew all of its frozen burgers from UK stores when the scandal first erupted two weeks ago as a precaution.

Also on Thursday, Aldi admitted for the 
first time that burgers sold through its UK stores were probably 
contaminated with traces of horse meat.

Its burgers were made by a British supplier, Dalepack, which is based in Richmond, north Yorkshire.

The
 same company manufactured burgers for Iceland, which has also admitted 
to finding horse meat in products sold to families in this country.

Dalepack also makes burgers for Waitrose and Sainsbury's, which both insist that their burgers are clear of contamination.
