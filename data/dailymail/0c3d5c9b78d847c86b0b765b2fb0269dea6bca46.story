From smartbands to high-end pedometers, never before have there been so many gadgets that claim to monitor health and boost fitness. 

But as technology gallops ahead, most come at a considerable financial cost.

Now researchers have found that smartphone apps that track an physical activity are in fact just as accurate as many fitness gadgets.

The study compared the performance of a five devices  - including Nike’s Fuelband, the Jawbone UP24 and Fitbit Flex - against five apps.

They analysed their ability to count steps as these are often used to calculate other measures of physical activity, such as distance covered or calories.

A total of 14 participants walked on a treadmill for 500 and 1,500 steps, multiple times, while different technologies counted their footsteps, according to a new research letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama).

‘In this study, we wanted to address one of the challenges with using wearable devices: they must be accurate, said University of Pennsylvania medical student and lead study author, Meredith Case.

‘After all, if a device is going to be effective at monitoring - and potentially changing - behaviour, individuals have to be able to trust the data.’

The study was based 10 devices and apps’ ability to count steps and popular wearables. Screenshots from the iPhone Moves app - one of those surveyed - are shown left and right. Step counts are often used to derive other measures of physical activity, such as distance or calories

‘We found that smartphone apps are just as accurate as wearable devices for tracking physical activity.’

The study is a follow-up to a recent Jama viewpoint suggesting that there's little evidence that wearable devices alone can change behaviour and improve health for those that need it most.

In the experiment, each of the healthy adults wore a waistband with one pedometer and two accelerometers attached, as well as three wearables on their wrist and two smartphones in their pockets.

The iPhone ran three apps - Moves,Health Mate and Fitbit - while the Android ran one Moves app. 

At the end of each trial, step counts from each device were recorded. 

The 10 top-selling devices and fitness apps in the US that were tested, were: Galaxy S4 Moves app, iPhone 5s Moves app, iPhone 5S Health Mate app, iPhone 5s Fitbit app, as well as Nike’s Fuelband, the Jawbone UP24, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit One Fitbit Zip and the Digi-Walker SW-200. 

The data from the smartphones were only slightly different than the observed step counts, with a range of minus 6.7 to 6.2 percent relative difference in mean step count. 

The results suggest that the Fitbit One and Zip devices are the most accurate surveyed, while Nike's Fuelband (pictured), appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials. However, over all, smartphone apps performed as accurately as wearables

But the data from the wearable devices differed more, with a range of between minus 22.7 to minus 1.5 percent.

The results suggest that the Fitbit One and Zip devices are the most accurate surveyed, while Nike's Fuelband, appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials.

Apps such as Moves for iPhone proved fairly accurate. The free app automatically tracks walking, running and cycling and shows a user's day as a simple storyline. It counts steps and shows calories burned for each activity.

Professor Mitesh Patel, an attending physician at the Philadelphia VA Medical Centre, who also teaches at the university, said: ‘Since step counts are such an important part of how these devices and apps measure physical activity, including calculating distance or calories burned, their accuracy is key.

‘Compared to the one to two percent of adults in the U.S. that own a wearable device, more than 65 percent of adults carry a smartphone.

Our findings suggest that smartphone apps could prove to be a more widely accessible and affordable way of tracking health behaviours.’
