Vulnerable: Richard Price with his seven-year-old daughter, Jessica, who admires One Direction

Visitors to our house can be left in no doubt as to which pop stars my daughter Jessica admires.

Drinks are taken from a One Direction cup, their fresh-faces beaming out at us at breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The band’s latest album, Midnight Memories, is on permanent loop, their movie This Is Us is watched every single weekend, while posters of Harry Styles, 20, Zayn Malik, 21, and 22-year-old Louis Tomlinson gaze down from her bedroom wall.

Louis is her favourite, she tells me on a daily basis. She believes he can do no wrong. Last week, when my wife calmly suggested the late Freddie Mercury was a better singer than Louis, World War III broke out.

Tears were shed and in the fallout, I found myself under attack for claiming, months earlier, that The Beatles were more successful than One Direction.

Facts, you see, are incidental. Because my daughter isn’t a headstrong 15-year-old, but a seven-year-old. To a seven, eight or nine-year-old, heroes are invincible, to be admired unquestioningly.

Just as schoolboys will copy the exploits of their football idols, so will One Direction’s impressionable fans ape their every move.

Which is why it is so dispiriting that two of the stars — Louis and Zayn — were filmed smoking pot and bragging about drug-taking.

The video provided proof, if any were needed, that One Direction are now a million miles from the sanitised image peddled to their target audience of tweenagers. The world’s most successful boy band are most popular not with young women their own age, but with little girls like my daughter. 

Like many parents of One Direction fans, I’ve spent the day hiding the newspaper and changing the TV channel when news about the band comes on.

It is a short-term strategy. When this week’s half-term is over, she will go back to school, and no titbit of One Direction gossip eludes the fans in the playground.

So I will have to find a way of explaining to a seven-year-old why taking drugs is bad. Where to begin, when she doesn’t even know what drugs are?

This isn’t the first time I’ve had reservations about just how suitable her idols are for their tweenage fans. They seem to have changed radically since their launch on the 2010 series of The X Factor.

'Dispiriting': A video has emerged showing Louis and Zayn (above) smoking pot and bragging about drug-taking

Gone are the clean-cut hairstyles and fresh-faces, replaced by tattoos, celebrity girlfriends, all-night partying and half-naked pictures on social networking sites such as Twitter. 

Surprising? No, not really. But for parents like me, a genuine problem. It’s Jessica’s eighth birthday next week, and a few months ago she began lobbying for her present — tickets to One Direction’s Wembley concert, on the eve of her birthday.

More than 70,000 fans will be hanging on their heart-throbs’ every word and gesture, and while plenty of girls Jessica’s age will be in the audience, as far as my wife and I are concerned, she is far too young to attend.

This decision prompted hours of sobbing followed by weeks of whining, but today I feel utterly vindicated — not to mention furious at the young men who have let my little girl down.

Because, while I’m sure men will prove themselves unworthy of my daughter in future, I didn’t know it would happen so soon.

How could they show her and their other young fans so little respect? Do they care so little about the impressionable kids who will now turn to their parents to ask why Zayn was smoking something called ‘Mary J’? It seems they don’t care at all. 

Because, as well as the cannabis smoking, the footage shows a sarcastic exchange between Zayn and Louis (or ‘Zouis’, as their dedicated young fans refer to the duo) about how they need a more mature image.

One Direction’s last book, according to Louis, was ‘so girly and not cool’. Their voices dripping with scorn, their contempt for such childish content is palpable.

These are the same books which I spent 
£17 a pop on for Jess’s last birthday and Christmas presents, 
contributing to Louis’s personal £14 million fortune.

Louis and Zayn say they want to grow up, yet their band is sold to the public via One Direction lunchboxes, stickers and dolls. How many fashionable teenagers do they expect to wear One Direction pyjamas and onesies?

The money brought in by these ventures borders on the obscene and they would be taking us for fools if they denied the ‘tween’ market is at the heart of it.

Today, I wish I could send every One Direction CD, poster and bit of plastic tat back. I find myself utterly furious at the downright stupidity of these spoiled fools.

What they fail to understand is that with their privilege comes a debt — and a responsibility — to their fans. This dope smoking act was never part of the bargain.

When One Direction were launched by Simon Cowell they were squeaky clean. Early promotional shots are almost unrecognisable alongside the tattooed, brooding figures we see today.

Like those tattoos, the change has crept upon us slowly. Harry and Zayn have hooked up with pop star girlfriends (the latter being caught cheating on his with a barmaid).

Liam risked his life to pose for a photograph standing on the roof of a skyscraper (he apologised, grudgingly, but Jessica thought it was a hoot).

'All about money': One Direction open the UK leg of their world tour, Where We Are, in Sunderland last night

Then last year Louis and Zayn were 
spotted smoking a suspicious looking roll-up cigarette on a yacht. This 
latest footage is no storm in a teacup. It strikes at the very heart of 
the band’s existence.

For One Direction are all about money, as you would expect of any ‘artist’ launched by Simon Cowell.

He is 
dealing with the fallout personally, in the knowledge he stands to miss 
out on a fortune if his protégées don’t weather the storm.

Their current tour is a gruelling 
88-date extravaganza which will see them take in South and North America
 and much of Europe, something which would put pressure on even the most
 energetic young performer.

Once merchandising is taken into consideration, the tour is forecast to gross $1 billion, making it the biggest in history.

Worry: Richard and his wife decided to ban their daughter from going to One Direction's Wembley concert

There was a time, not so long ago, when I saw One Direction as a harmless distraction for my daughter and her friends.

They were cheeky without being too risqué, while their movie was as funny and as inoffensive as The Beatles in A Hard Day’s Night. I even liked some of their songs.

Today the mask slipped, and all I can do is count my blessings that I banned Jessica from going to that Wembley concert.
