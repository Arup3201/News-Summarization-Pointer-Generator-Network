More than 66 million years ago, a fearsome beast roamed the planet that was so ferocious it has been dubbed the 'chicken from hell'.

Standing 10ft tall, the creature got its name because of a chicken-like crest on its head, feathered wings, long talons, a dangerous beak and a powerful tail.

Its official name is Anzu wyliei and palaeontologists from the University of Utah discovered three partial skeletons of the animal in ancient rocks in North and South Dakota.

Name: Anzu wyliei - after a bird-like demon in ancient mythology.

Height: 10ft (3m)

Weight: 45 stone (286kg)

Age: The dinosaur lived around 66 million years ago.

Features: The dinosaur had a crest on its head, feathered wings, long talons, a dangerous beak and a powerful tail.

Diet: Vegetation, small animals and eggs.

Character: Fighter.

Found: In ancient rocks in North and South Dakota.

Piecing the three fossils together, they found the separate parts formed an almost complete skeleton of a dinosaur.

Emma Schachner, a biology postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah, said: ‘It was a giant raptor, but with a chicken-like head and presumably feathers.

‘The animal stood about 10ft tall, so it would be scary as well as absurd to encounter.’

Matt Lamanna, of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, added: ‘We jokingly call this thing the 'chicken from hell,' and I think that’s pretty appropriate.

‘So we named it after Anzu, a bird-like demon in ancient mythology.’

The findings, published in the journal Plos One, describe a 45-stone beast which roamed the Dakota Hills 66 million years ago, at the same time as the most fearsome predator, Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Resembling a gigantic flightless bird, Anzu wyliei had a slender neck and hind legs, similar to an ostrich.

Piecing the three collections of fossils together, pictured, researchers found the separate parts formed an almost complete skeleton of a dinosaur. The fossils have preserved only bones, but close relatives of this dinosaur have been found with fossilised feathers, strongly, suggesting the new creature was feathered too

The fossils have preserved only bones, but close relatives of this dinosaur have been found with fossilised feathers, strongly suggesting the new creature was feathered too.

The dinosaur was an omnivore, eating vegetation, small animals and perhaps eggs, but the scientists think it may have been built to defend itself from larger predators.

Two of the three skeletons have signs of injuries, suggesting the species was a fighter. One has a broken and healed rib, and the other has evidence of trauma to a toe.

Dr Schachner continued: ‘These animals were clearly able to survive quite a bit of trauma, as two of the specimens show signs of semi-healed damage.

‘Whether these injuries were the result of combat between two individuals or an attack by a larger predator remains a mystery.’
