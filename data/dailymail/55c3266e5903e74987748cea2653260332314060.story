If you're a Facebook user, chances your News Feed is full of people's 'Timehop' posts that show their previous photos and statuses. 

Facebook has now launched its own version of this feature, called 'On This Day', that works in an almost identical way. 

Each day the social network will highlight posts made on the same date years before either by that user, or posts that the user was tagged in.

Facebook has launched 'On This Day' -  a tool that highlight posts made on the same date years previously. These posts only appear on a user's On this Day page, and this page can only be viewed by that user. They then have the option to edit, delete or share these posts with their friends

These posts only appear on a user's On this Day page, and this page can only be viewed by that user. 

They then have the option to share these posts with their friends. 

'People often look back at old photos and other memories they've shared on Facebook, and many have told us that they enjoy products and features that make this easier,' said the site in a blog post. 

'On This Day shows content from this date in the past. 

For example, you might see past status updates, photos, posts from friends and other things you've shared or been tagged in - from one year ago, two years ago, and so on.'

Facebook has been experimenting with this tool for a while. Currently, when statuses, photos and videos are uploaded, the app shows what was similarly posted on this day a year ago, for example. The new official tool (pictured) is rolling out to users in stages, so not everyone will be able to see it yet

On This Day is similar to the Timehop app that can be installed to Facebook's web and mobile site (examples shown). A major difference between the Timehop app and Facebook's tool, though, is that Timehop also collates posts made on Twitter, Instagram, Flickr and Foursquare in addition to Facebook

One in five Instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app.

To capitalise on this, the Californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called Layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations.

Photos can be selected from the phone's camera roll, or taken with the Photo Booth tool, and Layouts can then be 'remixed' and edited with mirror effects and flips.

However, once it's available they can click on the On This Day bookmark, search for 'On This Day,' or visit Facebook's dedicated On This Day page. 

And as the feature is rolled out further, users will also be able to access the tool when a friend posts a On This Day story in their News Feed.

Once on the page people can also choose to subscribe to notifications so they are alerted when they have memories to look back on. They can also edit and delete old posts.

Timehop describes itself as 'a daily nostalgia kick that will quickly become the highlight of your day.'
