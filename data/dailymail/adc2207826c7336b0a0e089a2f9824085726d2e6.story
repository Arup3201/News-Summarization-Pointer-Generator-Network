The sister of Rebecca Zahau, the woman found hanging at billionaire Jonah Shacknai’s home, has repeated her refusal to believe her sister committed suicide after police spelt out the finding of their investigation.

Rebecca Zahau, 32, was found dead on July 13, hanging from a second-floor balcony at a historic mansion in suburban Coronado, California belonging to Mr Shacknai, whose son had a tragic fall two days earlier.

Before she died a distraught Zahau painted a message in black paint on a door revealed San Diego Country Sheriff Bill Gore, as he said police had concluded the death was suicide not murder.

According to Zahau's ex-husband, Neil Nalepa, it read: 'She saved him, can he save her.'

But the lawyer representing her family has said that they do not want police to close the case.

'Rebecca had no history of suicidal tendencies, no psychological 
problems and no history of depression,'  Anne 
Bremner told 
RadarOnline.

'The family wants justice. The police have a duty to 
fully investigate the case and we don’t want them to close the 
investigation today. The family does not believe it was a suicide.'

Ms Zahau’s sister Snowem Horwath believes her 
sister was murdered. 'Becky did not kill herself, someone killed her,' she told RadarOnline.

'Time will reveal who killed Becky.  I think I 
know who killed my sister.  We are not stupid, she never had any 
enemies.'

The family is calling for a forensic psychiatrist and a 
criminal profiler to investigate the case and say the cryptic message in black paint was not Ms Zahau's handwriting.

Authorities showed a photo of the balcony over which Rebecca allegedly killed herself, but they covered up the message she painted in black on a door shortly before her death, seen right

Officials revealed yesterday that the paint from the message was still on her hands and on the rope when she died.

The fatal fall over a staircase railing of
6-year-old Max Shacknai, Jonah's son two days before Rebecca's death, was ruled an accident.

He was 
found not breathing and with no pulse by Rebecca at the bottom of the 
stairs after she heard a noise and came to look. She was the only adult at home at the time.

Authorities said the last call to 
Zahau's voicemail before her death had delivered the message that the 
boy was in grave condition and would likely die, as he did six days later.

The findings in the deaths followed a lengthy investigation.

'Were
these deaths the result of criminal conduct? Was Max's death a 
homicide? The answer is no,' San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told a 
news conference. .

This is a diagram shown Friday of how investigators say Max accidentally fell his death

Max was revealed to have broken his spinal chord in his fall, and was not breathing and had no pulse when he was found

'It was a tragic accident. Was 
Rebecca's death a homicide? Again the answer is no. It was a suicide ...
These deaths were not the result of any criminal acts.'

There
was no evidence of foul play, sexual assault or a struggle, authorities
said. She was alive when she went over the balcony and she died by 
hanging. There were no alcohol or drugs in her system.

She died at about 3 a.m and was found at 6:45 a.m. by Jonah's brother, who cut her down and called 911.

When Zahau's naked body was found 
hanging from the mansion's balcony with her ankles and wrists bound, 
investigators were quick to say they weren't ruling out suicide

On Friday they showed a video re-enactment of how someone could bind their own hands.

Authorities also said on Friday that Zahau had not been happy for some time and had recently lost weight.

DNA from the rope around her neck that was tied to a bed footboard, and foot impressions on balcony dust were also tied to Zahau, investigators said.

Someone left a voice mail message with Zahau at 12:50 a.m. the morning her body was found indicating that Max's condition had taken a serious turn and he wasn't expected to survive, Gore said.

One witness who authorities declined to identify said Zahau appeared depressed in January, Gore said.

Investigators discovered a lengthy 'journal' stored in her phone that also indicated she was unhappy.

 'Max was an extraordinarily loving, 
happy, talented, and special little boy. He brought joy to everyone who 
knew him... Rebecca too was a wonderful and unique person'

Jonah Shacknai

'This type of a suicide — its unusual but I don't think it's unprecedented,' Gore said.

All the DNA found on the binding and rope and fingerprints on the paint also belonged to her.

Jonah Shacknai released a statement expressing his sadness.

'While the investigation is over, the emptiness and sadness in our hearts will remain forever,' Shacknai said.

'Max
was an extraordinarily loving, happy, talented, and special little boy.
He brought joy to everyone who knew him, and we will miss him 
desperately.

'Rebecca too was a wonderful and unique person who will always have a special place in my heart,' he added.

Rebecca's sister Mary Zahau-Loehner revealed 
the news that the death had been ruled a suicide late Wednesday, but said she found investigators unconvincing when they broke 
their findings to her.

It doesn't add up,’ she said, after 
she was visited on Wednesday at her home in in St Joseph, Missouri, by 
investigators who told her their theory. ‘Nothing adds up.’

Ms Zahau was Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend of two years and Max was his son from a marriage that ended in divorce in 2008.

Ms Zahau-Loehner said she spoke with her 
sister the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she
planned to take her life.

She said she planned to bring Mr 
Shacknai breakfast and a change of clothes the next morning to the 
hospital where his son was being treated.

Ms Zahau also told her sister that she would call her parents in the morning on the way to the hospital.

She emailed another sister in Germany to say she would be updating throughout the next day.

'We've obviously had an extraordinarily difficult time. We have undertaken some tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a lifetime'

Jonah Shacknai

‘Too detailed planning for someone who's planning to end their life that night,’ Ms Zahau-Loehner said.

When Max fell down the stairs, Ms Zahau was at home with a 13-year-old girl who was related to her, authorities say.

He was hospitalised after paramedics found the boy wasn't breathing, his neck was broken and he did not have a pulse.

Two days later, Mr Shacknai's brother, Adam, called 911 to report that Ms Zahau appeared to be dead, investigators said.

The brother was staying in a mansion guesthouse. Jonah Shacknai was not at home as he was at his son's hospital bedside

The home, known as the Spreckels 
mansion, is one of the more storied properties in Coronado, a small 
suburb of multimillion-dollar homes on the tip of a peninsula across a 
bay from downtown San Diego.

The home has unobstructed beach views 
and sits near Coronado's main street, which is lined with palm trees and
upscale boutiques.

Mr Shacknai bought the mansion in March 2007, when it was assessed at $12.75million.

The home was built in 1908 and named 
for its original owner, John D. Spreckels, who also owned newspapers the
San Diego Union and San Diego Tribune.

Mr Shacknai founded Medicis 
Pharmaceuticals and has been chairman and chief executive of the 
Scottsdale, Arizona-based company since 1988.

In a divorce filing, he filed a tax return that showed his income in 1998 at $17million.

Medicis makes acne treatments Solodyn and Ziana and facial wrinkle treatment Restylane and Dysport, a competitor of Botox.

Last year, the company earned $123million on $700million in revenue.

Mr Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his only child with his second wife, Dina.

He told Medicis investors in August 
that he was planning to resume his daily routine of showing up at the 
office as soon as school resumed for his children in Arizona.

‘We've obviously had an 
extraordinarily difficult time,’ he said. ‘We have undertaken some 
tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a 
lifetime.’

Ms Zahau, a native of Myanmar, was an 
ophthalmic technician at Horizon Eye Specialists & Lasik Center in 
the Phoenix area from April 2008 to December 2010.

Ms Zahau-Loehner urged investigators keep the investigation open and said the family has hired an attorney. ‘There are many unanswered questions,’ she said.
