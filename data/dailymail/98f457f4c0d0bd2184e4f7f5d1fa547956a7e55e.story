Slimming is always easier if you have a dieting partner. So how lucky for bride Kate Bonwick that her husband, John Butler, also wanted to lose weight before their wedding.

And they are clearly both great motivators. The pair lost nearly 20 stone between them ahead of their big day - with Kate leading the way.

The bride-to-be, 25, lost half her body weight - going from 24 stone to 12 - after falling for John, 27, two years ago.

After shedding the pounds, the telesales manager from Bognor Regis, Sussex was finally able to fit into the wedding dress she had always dreamed of. And with supportive Kate's encouragement, 23-stone builder John lost more than seven stone, reaching 15.5 stone for the ceremony in November.

Kate said: 'Our wedding was the best day of my life. I felt beautiful and looked like a completely different person.

'It was very emotional for my family, seeing me like that. They love me for who I am on the inside and so does John, but they knew how much I wanted to be slim, so it was special for them too.

'The day was magical. We married at a beautiful church in an intimate ceremony, and then flew off on honeymoon to Florida. For the first time in years I wasn't ashamed to go to the beach.'

Kate said before she met John she had no confidence and was always the butt of jokes about her weight.

She said: 'When I went into pubs with my friends I was used to hearing people say "look at the size of her!" I pretended I didn't hear it but I was so unhappy. I was 23 and hated the way I looked.

'I hated my clothes and thought I looked awful - I didn't have a social life. I was always first to leave the party because I felt uncomfortable.

Kate said: 'Our wedding was the best day of my life. I felt beautiful and looked like a completely different person'

'I ate the wrong things. I could eat four packets of crisps and a whole packet of biscuits in one day. I never ate fruit and vegetables - I preferred to eat takeaways and kebabs four or five times a week.

'But when I walked down the aisle on my wedding day, people were saying how beautiful I looked. It was amazing.'

Kate used to consume thousands of calories per day eating burgers and pizzas every night. She skipped breakfast in the morning preferring to snack on crisps and chocolate from the vending machines at work during the day.

For lunch Kate would buy an unhealthy sandwich or burger from a shop, then for dinner gorge on chicken nuggets and pizza. Each meal would be washed down with litres of fizzy drinks.

But fearing she would be alone forever, Kate vowed to turn her life around.

After joining the Lighter Life slimming programme she lost four stone before starting internet dating.

Kate said: 'John was the first person I contacted on the site.

'We spoke on the phone and emailed but when the time came to meet I was so nervous. I weighed 20 stone and even though he was large as well I was worried he would take one look at me and run a mile.

'We went to a restaurant and I ordered the healthiest thing on the menu - even though I hated it.'

After finding love the pair encouraged eat other to lose weight and start regular exercise.

Now Kate says she feels like a different person and enjoys cooking healthy food for her and her husband.

Weighed down: Kate weighed 24 stone when she was 18, and John has lost more than seven stone since this picture was taken in 2008 (right)

She said: 'Now I love going out - I actually feel like I've never done it before because it's so different as a slim person.'

For breakfast Kate now eats two scrambled eggs and a banana, lunch is grilled chicken or fish with salad and for dinner she enjoys roast vegetables with grilled meat.

She said: 'I was determined to get into the kind of dress I always wanted to wear to my wedding.

'When I met John I was a dress size 26, but by the time we came to get married I was wearing a size 14 dress.

'John has always been a yo-yo dieter, but now he eats healthily like me, although he will eat more of what we make. We encourage eat other to live a healthier lifestyle and we go swimming and to the gym together.

'John is hilarious, he's the soppiest man I've ever met and he's also my best friend. When he proposed in June 2010 he told me he loved me and wanted to spend of his life with me.'

John added: 'I feel so lucky to have met Kate. We're perfect for each other and she keeps me looking my best.'
