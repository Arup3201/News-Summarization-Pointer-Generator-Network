Tragic: Marlene Blakey, 68, was killed in Newcastle when a single decker bus careered across the road and smashed into the bus stop she was stood at. It is alleged the driver fell asleep at the wheel

A church-going pensioner was killed after a bus driver careered onto the wrong side of the road and crashed into her after falling asleep at the wheel, a court has heard.

Stagecoach driver Robert Faichen, 54, had been suffering from undiagnosed sleep apnoea and was not 'with it' when he ploughed into Marlene Blakey, 68.

The pensioner had just attended a morning service at Prudhoe Street Mission in Newcastle when the single 
decker bus hit her from 
behind while she waited for a bus.

Ms Blakey was rushed to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle but later died of injuries to her chest and pelvis.

Faichen, of Blakelaw, Newcastle, was arrested and charged and has pleaded not guilty to causing death by careless driving.

Michael Hodson, prosecuting, told his trial at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday: 'The bus veered across the road into first the car lane and then into the opposite lane and collided with Marlene Blakey, a 68-year-old woman who was waiting for her bus.

'The crown say each driver, including the stagecoach bus driver who is the defendant in this case, has a responsibility to come to the road fit to drive with no impairment to his skills that he knows of that may endanger people.

'This defendant had a problem with sleeping at the time of this incident.

'He got two and a half to five hours sleep on average. This makes him prone to being sleepy during the day which he is aware.'

Jurors heard yesterday how after he was arrested, Faichen told police of his sleeping problems, saying that on average he would sleep between two and a half and five hours a night, interrupted by four to five visits to the toilet.

The prosecution claim that Faichen’s sleeping problems were worsened on the night before the accident by his drinking, whereby he consumed three pints and a double brandy, causing him to be abnormally tired on the day of the accident.

They also claim that if Faichen had informed his employers of his health problems they would have stopped him driving and the tragedy, which happened on December 4, 2011, would have been avoided.

Sleep apnoea is characterised by pauses in breathing or moments of very low breathing during sleep.

Each pause in breathing can last for about ten seconds to minutes and in some cases can occur five to 30 times within an hour.

Those who suffer with sleep apnoea are not usually aware of having problems with breathing, even when they wake up.

Sufferers can become fatigued during the day, have slow reaction times and vision problems.

Treatment can often begin with behavioural therapy. Doctors often tell patients to avoid alcohol, sleeping pills, and other sedatives.

The onset of sleep apnoea is most common in people aged 35 to 54. However, it can affect people of all ages.

It is estimated that around 4 per cent of middle-aged men and 2 per cent of middle-aged women suffer from the condition.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that during his police interview, Faichen admitted to on occasion falling asleep during the day 'within minutes'.

After the accident, he was diagnosed with sleep apnoea, a condition in which the sufferer can stop breathing for short periods during sleep, causing them to repeatedly wake throughout the night.

Mr Hodson continued: 'Being sleepy is a normal condition. It’s self preservation because being sleepy gives us notice that we need to find a place of safety.

'Sleep does not overcome us unexpectedly or suddenly or we would would be falling about in the streets.

'If he had talked to his employers and told them how he was, do you not think they would have stopped him driving?

'The defendant had been suffering from significant periods of sleepiness.

'He drove passengers in a bus at that time knowing that he was in danger of becoming drowsy, having to fight his drowsiness and perhaps falling asleep.'

Witness statements from passengers told how Faichen had 'not looked right' and had 'looked blank' as they boarded the bus.

Eye witnesses told how the bus had drifted in a 'gradual curve' across the road before hitting Ms Blakey.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
