She may be going through heartbreak following her split from Cristiano Ronaldo, but rather than wallow in her misery, Irina Shayk is showing the footballer what he's missing.

The Russian star, who found fame as a Victoria's Secret model, has been unveiled as the face - and long legs - of Spanish footwear brand, XTI.

This is the 29-year-old's eighth consecutive season as the face of the brand, and she stars, once again, alongside British male model, Stephen James in the steamy shoot.

Irina Shayk has been unveiled as the face - and enviably long legs - of Spanish footwear brand XTI

This is the Russian model's eighth consecutive campaign for the Spanish shoe brand

Posing in a tree, the tanned and toned model shows off the shoe brand's Spring offering.

In one shot she wears a sheer lace dress, which is slashed to her naval, as she shows off the label's seasonal boots.

In another portrait, she reclines on a tree displaying her enviably honed physique as a tattooed Stephen looks on.

This campaign is the second time in the past week that she's paraded her body. On Friday, she stripped off to a skimpy bikini whilst holidaying in Cancun, Mexico.

If anyone can sell shoes, it’s Irina Shayk. With her supermodel long legs and killer bod, the Victoria’s Secret model could probably make crocs look good!

Looking super-hot in her latest campaign for Spanish shoe brand XTI, Irina Shayk models a whole host of next season’s footwear, but our favourite has to be this pair of leopard print pointed flats.

Chic and sexy, leopard print has become somewhat of a modern classic. And if you’re not feeling bold enough to commit to a full on feline motif coat or dress, then leopard print accessories are the way to go.

On January 21, Real Madrid star Ronaldo confirmed that his five-year relationship with the Sports Illustrated model had come to an end.

The Portuguese footballer said: 'After dating for five years, my relationship with Irina Shayk has come to an end. We believed it would be best for both of us to take this step now. I wish Irina the greatest happiness.'

Rumours surfaced that their five-year relationship was in trouble when she failed to support him in Zurich when he was awarded the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or award.

Days later, Irina's spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We can confirm Irina Shayk has ended her relationship to Cristiano Ronaldo of five years.' 

She may be going through heartbreak following her split but Irina is making sure she's remains professional

She's well-known for her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue appearances between 2007 and 2014
