Is there anything worse than thinking you've found a parking space in the distance outside a busy shopping centre only to find as you get nearer there's a small car already there?

Well, a Facebook page has taken the frustrations of parking to a new level.

'You Park Like a P***k' has been set up to let drivers vent their anger on the liberties some road users take when they park their vehicles. The public group has so far 245 members who are encouraged to let loose about the ridiculous parking they've encounter their day and add photographs to back it up.

You sure you need to be that far over? Sometimes parking is not as easy as it seems

Too close for comfort: The driver will do well to get out of the this parking spot

The Facebook group is 'dedicated to the eradication of p***kery everywhere and anywhere. Good parking is what separates us from the beasts. P***kery is where humanity and decency begin to unravel.'

Sometimes one parking space is just not enough for some people

The bigger the vehicle, the more likely you'll be to commit a parking crime 

There are no shortage of people wanting to get parking problems off their chest either. 

'This is my recent collection ranging from Roxburgh Park shopping centre to Melbourne Airport. These people should be sent to Baghdad during peak hour,' commented Ali Yesilyurt, as he shared photographs of more serious parking crimes.

While Karen Grega said that the Facebook page helped her to deal with her parking rage. 

'Check out Bondi Road and you'll never be short of a pic or 20! Some people are such selfish parkers as I found out yet again at 11pm last night when I got home,' she commented.

'The space left between cars was absolutely ridiculous. Car after car was parked with large gaps in between, but not enough for another car to park. I think people just abandon their cars rather than park them. Vented, and now I feel better!!'

Snuggling up: thoughtless drivers create a tight squeeze again 

it all sounds very therapeutic, and one member even got all zen about it. 

'It is in the car park that civilisation as we know it starts and ends,' he commented. 'Poor parking is the butterfly's wing that results in civic chaos if not ripped from the insect at the first flap.' 

What's the point in using only one parking berth when you can have two 

There's no need to park properly at all when you can just leave your car in the road

Another member remarked: 'I believe this is my new anger management group.'

While Campbell Fuller summed up the very reason for the page existing in the first place by saying: 'Tradie parked a metre from the kerb - and right across my driveway. P***k.'

If only the many parking problems could be solved this easily
