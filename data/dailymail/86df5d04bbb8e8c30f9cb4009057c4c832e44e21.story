A haunting new short film starring Elle Fanning portrays the horrors of bulimia, but some say the depiction is somewhat too accurate.

Directed by Rodrigo Prieto with the help of his 19-year-old daughter Ximena, who was anorexic in her early teens, The Likeness stars Elle Fanning as a girl troubled by body image issues as she tries to physically tear her own skin off in self-disgust.

But while some claim the film truthfully captures the psychological agony of an eating disorder, others warn that it is more harmful than helpful for those who actually struggle with disordered eating.

True life: Directed by Rodrigo Prieto and his daughter Ximena, 19, The Likeness stars Elle Fanning as a girl with body image issues who tries to physically tear her own skin off in self-disgust

Reflection: Suddenly, her face turns into disjointed patches of peeling skin, a horrifying scene that is meant to symbolize the bulimic's distorted self-perception

Lynn Grefe, president of the National Eating Disorders Association, told Today.com: 'The whole feeling of feeling worthless, and ugly - I think it portrays that incredibly well.'

She added, however, that the disturbing footage may act as a trigger to someone still struggling with an eating disorder or body image issues.

And Ximena agrees. 'I definitely would say if someone is in the midst of dealing with an eating disorder, it's triggering,' she said. 'You’d have to be in a somewhat stable place to confront this emotion.'

The eight-minute video begins with a tour of a dark house filled with emaciated models and dazed-looking revelers, none of whom look at the camera as it pans by them.

Mr Prieto says that he originally wanted the models to stare at the camera, but he was dissuaded by his daughter.

'Ximena told me no, no, no, the worst
 feeling is when everybody ignores you,' he explained. 'That's why nobody
 is looking at the camera; everybody is doing their own thing.'

Unaware: 'Ximena told me...the worst feeling is when everybody ignores you,' he explained.'That's why nobody is looking at the camera; everybody is doing their own thing'

Risk: Ximena, who was anorexic in her teens, said: 'I definitely would say if someone is in the midst of dealing with an eating disorder, it's triggering. You¿d have to be in a somewhat stable place to confront this emotion'

The images become more and more disturbing - like a stick-thin woman striking a pose from behind a plastic sheet, and a sickly man stretched out on a table, his ribs protruding.

Finally, the film shows Elle standing in a bathroom, staring despondently at her own reflection in the mirror as she puts on mascara.

Suddenly, her face turns into disjointed patches of peeling skin, a horrifying scene that is meant to symbolize the bulimic's distorted self-perception, says Mr Prieto.

'What I wanted to do is represent what she's feeling and what's in her mind,' he said.

The film becomes particularly 
difficult to watch when the character attempts to physically rip off her
 own skin, screaming at the mirror in agony.

She then turns to the toilet and begins vomiting in it, before going back into the party and feigning normalcy to her friends.

Talking point: 'We are hoping it helps other people or families to open up and talk about what they've been feeling or experienced,' said Mr Prieto

A representative at Project Heal told MailOnline: 'Fanning's character, as she bemoans her own distorted reflection, accurately depicts the way in which someone with body dysmorphia may feel, to see horrifying flaws that truly are not there.'

She added, however, that the 'grotesque and harsh' imagery could have a negative effect on people who struggle with disordered eating.

'What I wanted to do is represent what she's feeling and what's in her mind'

'As someone who battled an eating 
disorder, we know the horror all too well and watching someone else go 
through it can be triggering and overwhelming if not in a good mental 
place,' she said.

While Mr Prieto and his daughter acknowledge that the film is disturbing, they also consider it necessary, even therapeutic, for a family that has dealt with eating disorders.

'I think it's important to face those triggering things, once you've, you know, recovered, because you can't spend the rest of your life running away,' said Ximena.

Her father added: 'We are hoping it helps other people or families to open up and talk about what they've been feeling or experienced. . . also about these feelings that we all have, of feeling judged and isolated and alone in this society.'
