It was hardly the reunion William Reid had imagined when he waved his daughter Melissa off to Ibiza seven weeks earlier.

In a police station in distant Peru, he tries to comfort his distraught child, stroking her hair and kissing her head as she sobs into his chest.

She cannot hug him back because her hands are cuffed. When he sees the chains around her wrists, he breaks down too.

William Reid hugs his daughter Melissa as he reunites with her in Diandro police station

This is the first time Mr Reid has seen his daughter since she and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru. 

Police officers believe they were knowingly involved in smuggling, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail. The women claim Colombian gangsters forced them to act as drug mules.

Exhausted from travel, Mr Reid confesses it takes him a few seconds to realise it is his child rushing towards him.

Her face is thin, there are deep bags under her eyes and she is almost unrecognisable from the happy, tanned teenager he saw in the photographs of her holiday she posted on Facebook.

Today Melissa turns 20, but there will be no celebrations at Lima’s maximum security Dirandro police station, where Mr Reid, 54, was allowed only 15 minutes with his daughter on Wednesday night. He says he is living his worst nightmare, and can scarcely believe what is happening.

While he flew out to Lima, his wife Debra, 53, a National Grid administrator, remained at their home in Lenzie, Glasgow, to look after their other children Liam, 22, and twins Stephanie and Jennifer, 18.

Still holding the Ugg boots he brought her from home, the father hugs his daughter - who cannot embrace him back because her hands were tied 

Seven weeks earlier, he dropped off his ‘bubbly, intelligent’ daughter at Glasgow airport for her flight to the Spanish party island of Ibiza, where she planned to work in bars and clubs for a season. Mr Reid, a manager for a gas company, told her to ‘have fun but be careful’.

On August 6, Melissa and Michaella were caught at Lima airport with nearly six kilos of cocaine hidden in their suitcases as they waited to board a flight to Madrid.

Melissa claims Colombian gangsters took her from Ibiza to Palma in Majorca, and then Madrid. At least one gang member escorted her on each flight. 

Physically shaking, Melissa tells her father: ‘They made me do it.’ But as he breaks down, she tells him soothingly ‘I know Dad’ and reaches for his hand. 

She talks quickly as she tells him how one of her new female friends in Ibiza had introduced her to a charming British man who gave his name as Jake.

She said he had seemed ‘really nice and friendly’, and he came back to the apartment she shared with a close friend from home, 20-year-old Rebecca Hughes.

There, she claimed, he became aggressive. ‘I felt really scared because I was alone in the flat. He told me I had to come and meet some of his friends and pressured me to get into a taxi.’

Then she was bundled into a flat and confronted by a group of Colombian gangsters, who put a gun to her head.

She says: ‘I could feel the metal against my temple. I thought they were going to kill me. They said they knew all about me and my family. I was so scared they were going to hurt them if I didn’t do as I was told. I didn’t know they wanted me to take drugs or money or guns at that point.’ 

Melissa Reid, 19, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country 

Melissa says she first met Michaella, from Northern Ireland, in one of the gangsters’ dingy hideaways in Palma. They were kept captive in a flat, she said, then flown to Lima separately.

Officers suspect they were recruited by a cartel allegedly operated from behind bars by Philip Austin Collins, the nephew of singer Phil Collins.

The 38-year-old was arrested in Peru last year after £3million worth of cocaine was found on a yacht he and two other British men were trying to sail across the Atlantic.

During the first visit, Melissa tells her father: ‘I wanted to tell the air hostesses or anyone in the airports, but the men said they would know if we had spoken to anyone, that they were watching all the time.

‘It was a choice between doing what I was told and getting it over and done with and hopefully getting back to Spain or trying to escape and being killed.’

The two women are in separate concrete cells, but are able to communicate when they visit the shared bathroom. Melissa says she is ‘freezing’ at night, but that staff are treating them well.

The women are trying to help the police to find the mystery Briton, who is believed to work finding ‘drugs girls’ in Ibiza.

She tells her father that they expect to be questioned formally by police for the first time within the next 24 hours.

Melissa also says she fears evidence has already been contaminated, claiming police officers did not wear gloves as they handled the food bags in which the drugs are said to have been stored. 

As she talks to her father about her fears, a detective tells her that she must return to her cell.

Mr Reid quickly gives her a few comforts he and his wife chose from her bedroom at home – a navy blue spotted onesie from Next, a pink fleece and her grey Ugg Boots.

She puts them on immediately.

The father and daughter look anguished as she stands up to leave and Mr Reid whispers in her ear: ‘We will do everything we can to get you out of here. We will work something out.’

As they separate, armed guards lead Melissa down to her cell and she shouts to her father, ‘I need to learn Spanish’. As the metal doors leading to the prison shut, she shouts: ‘I love you dad’.

Mr Reid was able to return to visit his daughter and Michaella last night. They described how they tried to escape in Palma, when they saw the door to the flat was ajar.

Michaella said: ‘We looked at each other and said “let’s run away and escape now”. 

‘We didn’t think the men spoke English but then one of the guys ran over to us and said: “Be nice my friends, or my friends will shoot you in the head’ and he made a shooting gesture. 

‘We were so scared that we didn’t try to run after that.’
