Erik Lamela is eager for a fresh start in the Premier League this season after Tottenham Hotspur's record-breaking signing took to Twitter to tell of their pre-season training.

The winger, compared to the departed Gareth Bale at times last year, was bought from Roma for £30million, but struggled to adapt to the English game and was sidelined by on-off injuries.

The 22-year-old, however, seems keen to put that behind him, with new manager Mauricio Pochettino at the helm after arriving from Southampton.

2013-NOW: Tottenham (9 apps, 0 gls)

2011-NOW: Argentina (6 caps, 0 gls)

Bale's £86m move to the Bernabeu from White Hart Lane left a clear gap, with Lamela billed as the man with the potential to fill the void.

The ex-River Plate star, though, made just 17 appearances last season in all competitions, scoring once in the Europa League against FC Sheriff.

Pre-season will be more pivotal for Tottenham than other clubs, given the arrival of Pochettino from St Mary's.

The Argentine, notorious for leading heavy training sessions during pre-season, was given the chance to have a look see at what he will be working with in north London.

Pochettino, who led Southampton to eighth place in the Premier League last season, will be expected to qualify for the Champions League and is the club's third manager in the last two years.

That is after they got rid of Tim Sherwood and Andre Villas-Boas, respectively.
