Police spoke to the family of 'outstanding' public schoolboy Charlie Booth hours before he died after shotting himself with his father's shotgun, it was revealed today

Police spoke to the family of an 'outstanding' public schoolboy hours before he died after shooting himself with his father's shotgun, it was revealed today.

Promising student Charlie Booth, 16, was found dead at his family's £500,000 home in Cobham, Kent around 10.30pm on Friday.

Kent Police have today confirmed that an officer had been in touch with his family in relation to an undisclosed 'incident' earlier the same day.

A force spokesman said: 'There was no ongoing criminal or pending investigation and the matter was resolved at the meeting.

'However, as there was police contact the matter has been routinely referred to the IPCC.'

The spokesman refused to say exactly why officers had attended earlier in the day, saying only that it was over a ‘minor incident’ regarding the teenage cadet, a pupil at £10,000-a-year Gad's Hill School, and was ‘not the result of a 999 call’.

He said: 'It was a meeting with Charlie and his parents over a minor incident. It was not a 999 call and was a meeting to discuss an incident (involving Charlie) from earlier the same day.'

In the days before his death Charlie tweeted about his volatile moods and said he got caught up in arguments.

One message at 6.49pm on March 7, the day before he died, said: 'Swear I get in shit moods for no reason at the moment! Need to sort myself out.'

The previous day he wrote: 'Hopefully my last ever maths exam done :)'

And on February 28 he tweeted: 'Everything seems to turn into an argument.. :/.' 

Charlie lived with his father Nicholas, 52, director of a farm equipment supplier, mother Julia, 48, a school communications manager, and sister Harriet, 12.

In a statement they said: 'As a son he was a very loving boy that had a very supportive family, not just his parents, but his aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents.

'He thought the world of them and we all thought the world of him.

Charlie was a pupil at £10,000-a-year Gad's Hill School and a member of the school's Combined Cadet Force. His parents paid tribute to their 'beautiful boy'

'He was just a typical country boy that enjoyed school life, loved outdoor pursuits and he fully embraced the country lifestyle.

'Charlie was one in a million, very popular and well-liked, and was quite simply our beautiful boy.'

Charlie was a pupil at £10,000-a-year Gad's Hill School and a member of the school's Combined Cadet Force.

It trains pupils in a range of military activities including survival training, rock climbing, tackling assault courses and shooting.

He was also a keen sportsman who represented his school at cross-country, rugby and hockey.

He was preparing for a school trip to Alaska in July and had raised several thousands of pounds towards the cost himself with fund-raising events.

He was described as an 'excellent ambassador for our school' by his headmaster at Gad's Hill, David Craggs

Mr Craggs said yesterday: 'I am sure you will all react with shock and deep sadness at this news. Charlie was after all a remarkable young man, who had such a bright future ahead of him.

'Our first thoughts are for Charlie’s family and I can say with confidence that they have the heartfelt support and condolences of the whole Gad’s Hill community.

'It is at times like this - to quote recent comments by President Barack Obama - we will all hug our own children a little closer over the next few days.'

Kent police said they were not making any inquiries into the ownership of the weapon used in Charlie's death which is understood to have been licensed.

Gad's Hill School - based in the former Georgian home of author Charles Dickens - was named as the country's top independent school in 2011.
