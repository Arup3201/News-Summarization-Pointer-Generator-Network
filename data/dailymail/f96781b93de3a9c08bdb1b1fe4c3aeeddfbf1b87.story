Michael Lawton, 54, went on the rampage after he was plagued by local youths who pulled pranks on him that pushed him over the edge, making him attempt to explode a local Morrisons petrol station

A homeowner has been jailed for trying to blow up his street by setting fire to a petrol station with a candle after 'flipping' over years of abuse from his neighbours.

Michael Lawton, 54, took the drastic action after he was plagued by local yobs who made his life 'a misery'.

A court heard he flipped after having his windows smashed, his car tyres let down and eggs thrown at his house in Milehouse, Staffordshire.

In a bid to deal with the nuisance neighbours 'once and for all' Lawton planned to destroy the entire street by blowing up a local petrol station in a drastic act of revenge.

On July 9 last year he went to a nearby Morrisons supermarket armed with just a candle and a bucket where he cut five different hoses in an attempt to set a monster blaze.

But because it was 1.45am the petrol pumps had been shut down and he only succeeded in lighting a small fire at the base of one pump.

After returning back to his home following his botched attempt Lawton decided to hand himself into police four days later.

He told police he had taken matters into his own hands because they had done nothing to help him since neighbours started picking on him two years ago.

At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Wednesday Lawton pleaded guilty to attempted arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered.

Lawton tried to blow up this Morrisons petrol station in Milehouse, Staffordshire, in a bid to kill himself and destroy the road where those making his life a misery by constantly pulling pranks on him lived, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard

He was jailed for two-and-a-half years by Judge Paul Glenn who told him the consequences of his actions could have been 'catastrophic'.

He added: 'Your actions were highly dangerous. It is a matter of pure good fortune that you did not cause a significant fire.

'You do not suffer from a mental disorder. 

'The problems that you detail... do not begin to justify what you did.

'Your actions could have been catastrophic.'

Lawton called police on July 12 to admit to his crime - adding that he had intended to blow himself up and take the drive where he lived 'with him.'

Prosecutor David Bennett told the court that staff returned to the station the next morning to find £1,250 worth of damage to the forecourt.

Mr Bennett said that CCTV footage later revealed Lawton 'messing around' by the pumps in the early hours and using a bucket as a wind breaker as he attempted to set the fire.

Stuart Clarks, defending, said that if his client had not called police he would never have been caught.

The 54-year-old, was fed-up with yobs on his drive smashing his windows, letting his car tyres down and throwing eggs at his house on Wilmot Drive (shown here) in Milehouse, Staffordshire

He said: 'He was the victim of a number of crimes. 

'His car tyres were targeted on a number of occasions, his windows had been smashed in the house and eggs had been thrown at the house.

'His face did not fit.

'He contacted the police and local authority about the problem with youths in the area and nothing happened.'

One resident on the street said he felt sorry for his neighbour who had become the target of local youths.

The father-of-three, who did not wish be named, said: 'They’ve been picking on him for a couple of years and I know he had complained about them.

'It’s terrifying to think he wanted to take such drastic action. 

'Everyone has been saying it’s like that Michael Douglas film Falling Down - he just had enough and flipped.

'But it’s no laughing matter really. We could all have been blown to high heaven.'
