For most of the year it is a quaint seaside town, but the picturesque port of Whitby in Yorkshire took on an altogether more sinister air this weekend as thousands of Goths, steampunks, and fans of the macabre descended for a twice-yearly celebration of gothic culture, and all things that go bump in the night.

Fans travelled from across the globe to attend the famous Whitby Goth Weekend, donning their spookiest finery for the five-day extravaganza promising music, dance and shopping.

The festival, which has been running since 1994, is the largest of its kind in the world and is so popular that in 1997 is began running twice a year, in April and October - to coincide with Halloween.

The town in North Yorkshire was chosen because it was where Irish author Bram Stoker wrote the gothic horror classic Dracula, and it is filled with eerie landmarks such as Whitby Abbey, which is said to be the inspiration behind the literary vampire's castle.
