These are the suits by a boutique clothes label which a crime boss has allegedly used to hide his ill-gotten gains - including the blue satin number he wore to court.

N1 Angel claims to be an outfitter to famous figures including Brazilian footballers Tiago Silva and Neymar Jr.

But its £400 designs have been drawn into a High Court battle by crime boss Terry Adams, 58, after prosecutors said the firm - run by his wife - was a front to hide his past earnings.

Accused: N1 Angel - which designed the blue satin suit worn by crime boss Terry Adams in his battle at the High Court (pictured) - has been described as not being a 'legitimate business' by prosecutors

Adams is the head designer for N1 Angel, which shot to prominence after he appeared at the High Court this week wearing one of its bolder designs.

The blue suit had first appeared on the company's Twitter feed last month, billed as 'coming soon', and press photographs of Adams wearing it outside his court appearance were proudly reproduced by the firm online yesterday.

Adams is fighting at the High Court to write off £628,000 which he still owes to the state seven years after he was convicted of conspiring to conceal criminal proceeds.

He says he is broke and his enterprises make little money - but prosecutors insist Adams does have the cash, pointing to his and his wife's life of luxury.

His wife Ruth's spending included £12,000 on dental 
treatment, £3,850 on spa membership 
for her husband and nearly £15,000 on restaurants and 
holidays including 20 meals at Brown's in Mayfair, prosecutors said.

The firm's suits sell mostly for £400, but it is also selling a limited edition leather overcoat for £3,000

Proud: The firm's website and Twitter feed do not shy away from revealing the identity of its designer

And the prosecutors focused on N1 Angel, the clothing firm owned by Mrs Adams and registered at a flat the couple share in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Its website and Twitter feed do not shy away from revealing the identity of its designer.

'Our
 name is an affectionate homage to Angel, Islington (N1, London) – the 
area that head designer, Terrence (Terry) Adams, was born and raised,' the website says.

'It was in Angel 
that Terrence designed his first bespoke suit at the age of just 14, and
 it was in Angel that Terrence came to understand the “transformative 
power of style”.

'Our 
collections are peppered with historical references that have been 
interpreted by Terrence, with the modern gentleman in mind.

'Three-button
 tailored suit jackets are a nod to the dapper 1960s aesthetic, yet bold
 and eclectic garment detailing invites modernity into the collections.'

The firm's suits sell mostly for £400, but it is also currently selling a limited edition black leather overcoat for £3,000.

Famous names: The firm said its designs were sported by Brazilian footballers including Neymar (pictured)

Proud: The firm did not shy away from the publicity it earned from the case involving its crime boss designer

On Twitter it boasts of celebrity endorsements, including by three of Brazil's most famous footballers.

'N1 Angel thanks Brazil players, Marcelo, Tiago Silva and Neymar for wearing N1 Angel', it said on June 1.

But Kennedy Talbot for the Crown 
Prosecution Service, which is fighting Adams' application for a 
court-approved 'certificate of inadequacy', told the High Court the 
company was not a 'legitimate business'.

Terry Adams rose to power as the head of the Adams family, which detectives believed was linked to a string of criminal operations.

Based in Clerkenwell, North London, they evaded prosecution for years by running their syndicate at arm's length.

In 2007 the Old Bailey was told Adams traded on his feared family name 'like a board of directors would guard a trademark'.

In March that year he was convicted and jailed for seven years over a £1million money-laundering scam.

He was known for living the high life. In 2003 police found a £274,000 haul of art at his north London home - including Picasso etchings, Henry Moore prints 
and Asprey's vases.

He accused Mrs Adams, 53, a former Eastenders actress who appeared recently in the cockney musical Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be, of hiding profits her husband made when he was a 'career criminal'.

And the CPS says there is 'a strong case' that he has 'substantial undisclosed assets'.

Mrs Adams insisted the firm was genuine and she had employed her husband because she could see he dressed well.

Of her generous spending, she added: 'I obviously live above my means. What else can I say?'.

Mr Adams has been described in the courts as once heading one of the most feared organised criminal gangs in the UK.

The
 58-year-old owes £628,497 of a confiscation order of £750,000 that was 
imposed after his conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court in 2007 for 
conspiring to conceal the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six-year 
period.

He was also ordered 
to pay prosecution costs of £50,000 and the £4.6 million bill for his 
publicly funded defence.

A judge previously said he had accumulated a 'considerable
 fortune' from his life as 'a highly successful career criminal' over a 
'significant' period of time.

The civil hearing continues.
