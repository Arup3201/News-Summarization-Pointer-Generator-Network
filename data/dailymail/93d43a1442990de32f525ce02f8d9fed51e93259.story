As a September ritual, high school seniors will be poring over the new college rankings, released today by U.S. News & World Report

Princeton University, the ivy league school in New Jersey, took the top ranking.

The magazine determines it's rankings based on sixteen different criteria including freshman retention, graduation rates and strength of faculty.

Best of the best: U.S. News & World Report ranked Princeton University in New Jersey the best U.S. national university

1. Princeton University

2. Harvard University

3. Yale University

4. Columbia University

5. Stanford University

5. University of Chicago

7. Duke University

7. Massachusetts Institute of Technology

7. University of Pennsylvania

10. California Institute of Technology

10. Dartmouth College

12. John Hopkins University

12. Northwestern University

14. Brown University

14. Washington University in St. Louis

16. Cornell University

17. Vanderbilt University

18. Rice University

18. University of Notre Dame

20. Emory University

20. Georgetown University

20. University of California - Berkeley

The rankings were compiled after reviewing data from 1,800 institutions.

This year the magazine changed it's methodology slightly by decreasing the weight of high school rank, a figure that colleges don't take as seriously anymore.

They also increased the weight on graduation and retention rates for national universities and liberal arts colleges. Regional schools were ranked with an increased importance on an institution's predicted graduate rate versus the actual graduation rate.

Even with the new changes though, the magazine says that the top schools remained relatively the same.

Following Princeton in the top five were the usual suspects of Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford, and the University of Chicago.

Only one public school made it into the top 20. The University of California, Berkeley, tied for twentieth with Emory and Georgetown Universities.

Good value: Princeton has a 'no loan' policy for financially needy students which gives them grants instead to pay for tuition

Princeton was also ranked number three in the magazine's list of Best Value Colleges.

Since cost is a major factor for students, the magazine drafted that list to help students determine which schools would give them 'the most bang for their buck'.

Princeton currently has a 'no loan' policy for students with financial needs.

Those students who need help paying for tuition get grants instead of loans.Â 

In addition to the main national university rankings, the magazine also puts out various other lists for it's 2014 Best Colleges issue.

Other lists include the 'A+ Schools for B Students', 'Best Undergraduate Business Programs', and 'Up-and-Coming Schools'.
