National outrage over the racist 
comments uttered on Big Brother last week haven't stopped the 
contestants involved from spewing out more insulting slurs.

After the eviction episode Thursday, Aaryn Gries targeted fellow housemate Candice Stewart by flipping over her mattress.

After warning her not to flip her mattress again, Gries responded back in a 'black' accent mocking the African-American Stewart.

'Watchu gon do gurl?' Aaryn said in an attempt to rile an African American housemate

'Whatchu gon' do gurl...whatchu gon' do? Class girl. Where's yo class?' Aaryn mocked.

And not to be outdone by her friend, GinaMarie Zimmerman piped in with more racism.

As Candice was getting worked up, GinaMarie confronted her saying: 'You want the black to come out?'

Race war: Candice had to be physically removed from the room by housemate Howard Overby

Housemate
 Howard Overby - who is also black - had to physically remove Candice 
from the room to stop the fight from escalating.  Both
 GinaMarie and Aaryn drew criticism earlier this week when CBS aired 
some of their racist comments originally seen only by subscribers on the
 internet-only live feed. After
 contestant Howard Overby told his fellow housemates’ of the ladies 
remarks, calling them comments that ‘you can’t apologize for,’ the 
network went to the videotape.

Awful: A contestant can be heard off-camera mocking an Asian housemate

Gries is shown mocking Asian house 
guest Helen, saying ‘shutup, go make some rice,’ while mocking nail 
salon workers. Zimmerman then chimed in ‘'Andy was like, ''I'm gonna 
punch her in the face,'' and I was like, ''Maybe that'll make her eyes 
straight.’Soon after, the dynamic duo moved on to deriding African-Americans.Digging
 the hole deeper, Zimmerman said fellow contestant Candice Stewart ‘is 
on the dark side, but she's already dark,’ with Gries adding ‘be careful
 what you say in the dark because you might not be able to see the 
b----.’

Hateful: Another housemate can he heard joining in on the racism, the remarks were aired Sunday night by CBS

Fired: Aaryn Gries and GInamarie Zimmerman were fired after their employers became aware of their hateful comments on the show

Not to be outdone, Gries then called gay housemate Andy Herren a ‘queer.’

‘Dude, that’s rude!’ said a fellow contest seeing the slurs for the first time.

'Even
 when these comments are made in fun, they still hurt and are 
disrespectful, especially when that person isn't there to hear it and 
back themselves up,’ the African-American Overby told the cameras. ‘It 
could privvy me to losing my temper, but that's a no-no. I have to keep 
my eyes down the field for the bigger prize.

Though not aired on Sunday night, Spencer Clawson was also heard slamming gays and praising Adolf Hitler.

'[Gries]
 makes comments that are completely inappropriate, where she makes fun 
of other people for what they look like and their ethnicity, and I think
 that's going to hurt her -- a lot -- in the game and outside the game,'
 contestant Amanda Zuckerman opined.

Terrible: Spencer Clawson's praise of Hitler and homophobic slurs may have cost him his job with railroad operator Union Pacific

Fallout from the ranting was swift.

Gries, a 22-year-old student and sometimes model, was dropped from her talent agency.

'We
 certainly find the statements made by Aaryn on the live Internet feed 
to be offensive,’ Zephyr Talent said in a statement on its Facebook 
page, adding that ‘upon much consideration, we have decided to release 
Aaryn from her contract…’

Zimmerman, a pageant director for East Coast USA Pageant, was also fired.

'We
 are actually thankful that this show let us see GinaMarie for who she 
truly is,’ a spokesperson said, ‘we would never want her to be a role 
model to our future contestants.'

Currently on unpaid leave from Union Pacific while participating in the show, Clawson has also found himself in hot water.

‘The
 values represented by Spencer Clawson's comments during the 'Big 
Brother' show do not at all align with Union Pacific's values,’ said a 
statement on the railroad operator's site. ‘Union Pacific does not 
condone his comments. Union Pacific is acting in accordance with 
Collective Bargaining Agreement terms regarding Mr. Clawson.'
