Glen Johnson has admitted he could be set to leave Liverpool after talks about a new deal had gone “very quiet”.

The England defender, who has just returned from a six week injury lay-off, is out of contract next summer. From January 1, he will be free to talk to foreign clubs and be able to sign a pre-contract agreement.

Johnson, who joined Liverpool in 2009, has so far resisted Fenway Sports Group’s offer of a 12-month extension. Talks started earlier this year but there has been an impasse and, at present, there does not look as if there will be a resolution.

It has left Johnson aware that his time at time Anfield could be up at the end of the current campaign but he does not want to dwell on the issue.

‘(It’s) very quiet,’ said Johnson, who made is reappearance in Saturday’s 2-1 win over West Brom. ‘I am just concentrating week by week and not thinking about it. Of course (I want to stay). But like I say I worry about this week, this week and then next week, next week. That is how I live my life.’

Liverpool last week secured Daniel Sturridge to a new long-term contract and have opened negotiations with both Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson’s representatives about extending and improving their respective deals.

Johnson, meanwhile, was injured in the second game of the season at Manchester City and his return against West Brom came too late for him to be included in the England squad for the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Estonia and San Marino.

‘I would have preferred the international break to have come next week so I could declare myself fit and available,’ said Johnson. ’With the squad being picked last Thursday I haven’t played for six weeks so I can’t be involved. Of course I want to go away with the England team and play again for them as well.

‘It has been frustrating to watch (Liverpool) because you want to be out there on the line with the lads, and you want to be there even more when it is not going too well. The most important thing for me was getting fit and hoping the lads could pull us on while I was not able to help.

‘It is difficult when you have bad periods, but you’ll get good periods. That is football. It was always going to be difficult with the expectation (this season), but you have these ups and downs.’
