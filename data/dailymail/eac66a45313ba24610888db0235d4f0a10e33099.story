The Houston alley cat who gained national renown for dropping twenty per cent of his total body weight through rigorous dieting in little more than a year will undergo surgery next week for cancer.

A veterinarian at the animal hospital where Tiny Tim, the Texas city's favorite tubby tabby, permanently resides announced the potentially-fatal illness on the cat's Facebook page, 'Tiny Tim at Spah,' earlier in the week.

'Tiny Tim has cancer,' Dr. Alice Frei wrote. 'There is no radiation or chemotherapy for such an aggressive tumor.'

Back on track: Tiny Tim, who weighed 35 lbs when he was found last Christmas, has now lost eight lbs. His diet was momentarily interrupted when he took to secret midnight snacking

Frei then followed that initial report by writing in a subsequent post on Friday around 3 pm that vets had pronounced the 
cat's chest clear of cancer, and were soon to conduct a biopsy on the 
tumor.

Should the cancer had spread to the area, the prognosis for Tiny Tim would reportedly have been terminal.

'This
means Tiny Tim comes home today,' Frei wrote in a Friday post. 'It also
means more waiting. More moments of hope, heart racing fear and 
sleepless nights. I must remind myself that from Tiny Tim’s perspective 
it was a day without the usual food and fun.'

Tiny
Tim boards at the Southside Place Animal Hospital in Houston, which 
reportedly accepted him as a permanent resident around Christmas 2011 
after local animal rescue officials found him as a stray.

At
the time, Tiny Tim tipped the scales at a staggering 35.2 pounds, or 
about 22 pounds more than a healthy tabby. The feline was reportedly 
otherwise okay.

Fat cat: He was found in Houston last year and shelter staff were unable to track down his owner

The 
curvaceous cat has since dropped about seven pounds through a year of 
dieting that reportedly allows him only a precise 307 calories per day.

'He
has been on a very, very regimented diet -- measured meal plans, the 
whole works, and he is at 28.6 pounds,' SPAH manager Debbie Green told 
ABCNews.com in a recent interview.

'He
weighs in twice a week, and he gets meals measured in little bags 
throughout the whole week, so we know exactly what he's eating.' 

'Tiny Tim has cancer. There is no radiation or chemotherapy for such an aggressive tumor'

Vets at SPAH noticed swelling on Tiny Tim's elbow on Wednesday, and performed a pathology.  

The
cat was then shuttled to Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine, 
where vets confirmed the cancer, and 'said (it) was so rapidly growing 
that they could not define the cell of origin.'

'If
Tiny Tim's CAT scan does not show [the] tumor has invaded his chest, we
have decided that the only course of treatment is to have the leg 
amputated,' Frei previously wrote on Facebook. 'If the tumor has spread 
to his chest his treatment options are basically zero.'

Pawsitive progress: Tiny Tim is pictured left on the scales at 31.9 lbs and right at 29.9 lbs

Home: He is now a permanent resident at the clinic, where staff monitor his meals and encourage him to walk as much as possible by placing him at different spots around the center

Tiny
Tim's saga took an unusual, yet endearing, turn in late December, when 
flummoxed SPAH vets announced to interested media they could not crack 
the 30-pound plateau during Tiny Tim's weigh-in's.

The
staff later discovered the wily tabby was surreptitiously snacking on 
dog food during the wee hours of the morning - and only during those 
hours - by removing food from a hole he had fashioned in the bag of 
kibble.

 'I'll
frequently go in there and lay down right beside him, because he can't 
jump in your lap. He looks at you with such love and 
devotion'

The tabby ironically boards in the animal hospital's pantry, according to ABC News, because he requires extra space and reportedly perfers solitude and quiet.

After
he was found on the street, Tiny Tim was first taken to BARC Animal 
Shelter & Adoptions where volunteers gave him his nickname and 
decided to take on his recovery.

One
of the volunteers at BARC, Tim Hebert, took him to the Southside Place 
clinic and, after staff were unable to find his previous owner, he 
became a permanent resident at the center.

'Of course now we've all fallen in love with him,' Reyna added.

Hebert said he too is still attached to the cat and goes back to the clinic to visit him.

'I'll
frequently go in there and lay down right beside him, because he can't 
jump in your lap,' Hebert said. 'He looks at you with such love and 
devotion.'
