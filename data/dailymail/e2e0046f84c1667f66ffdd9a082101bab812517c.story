With its bright orange roof and a conservatory-style garden room, it bears something of a resemblance to 'Beckingham Palace', one-time home of David and Victoria Beckham.

This is Anmer Hall, the new country seat of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as it nears the end of what is believed to have been a £1.5million-plus refurbishment.

The glass-roofed 16ft by 16ft garden room will host a large dining table, allowing William and Kate to look up at the stars as they dine.

Anmer Hall is on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. The previous tenant was asked to move out by Her Majesty and the house has been converted for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

Around £500,000 was spent putting new tiles on the roof which some have complained are too bright. According to an expert, they will weather after five years

Before: The old house had a much duller grey roof. The wood store (top left) has now been converted into a nanny flat, while the garage block (bottom right) is now accommodation for police protection officers

It also links the house to an old wood store which has been transformed into a ‘nanny flat’ for Maria Borallo, who was recently employed by the couple to look after Prince George.

The couple already have a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, which has been brought up to scratch with the help of £1.5million-worth of taxpayer-funded improvements.

But the Queen decided to give the couple the 200-year-old Grade II*-listed mansion on her Sandringham Estate in Norfolk after asking her existing tenant, who still had several years left to run on his lease, to move out.

Work on the ten-bedroom house began in September after King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council agreed a series of planning applications that were never published ‘for reasons of national security’.

Royal sources say Kate plans to use the rest of her ‘maternity leave’ to focus on finishing the house.

One said: ‘She is going to spend a great deal of time there over the next few weeks with a view to being able to move in this summer.

'The family will spend most weekends there, although Kensington Palace will remain their primary residence.’.

The works also included building a 'garden room', which is 16ft by 16ft and will house a new dining table. It also has a glass roof so guests can dine under the stars

The country home also includes a tennis court (left) and an outdoor swimming pool (above the main house) though these were in place before the renovation started

The most noticeable difference at the 
Georgian mansion, which already has an outdoor pool and tennis court, is
 the new clay pantiles roof, estimated to have cost in excess of 
£500,000.

According to 
Tony Passmore, managing director of Passmore Group, a Yorkshire-based 
group specialising in refurbishments, the tiles are actually ‘rather bog
 standard’.

‘Surprisingly, they aren’t 
much different from the kind of tiles you and I would have on our houses
 and are actually in keeping with a traditional-style house,’ he said.

‘The colour is rather bright but they will weather and in five years or so will look as if they have been there for ever.’

A further £100,000 will have been spent on replacing the dormer windows which have been rebuilt in timber with lead roofs.

The
 most eye-catching addition is the garden room, estimated to have cost 
£250,000-£300,000 and designed by Charles Morris, one of Prince 
Charles’s favourite architects

The original plans showed it with a 
tiled roof, but a second application requested a glazed roof, allowing 
more sunlight to flood in.

The 200-year-old property had rotting window frames replaced on the upstairs windows, while more money was spent beefing up security to keep the Royal couple safe

Signs have been put up warning that the area is strictly private. All the work at Anmer Hall has been paid for by the Royal Family as it is privately owned by the Queen

According
 to Mr Passmore, a member of the Federation of Master Builders, the 
conservatory jars with the rest of the building. ‘It looks like it has 
been rather stuck on and doesn’t really fit with the rest of the 
property,’ he said.

‘They 
have incorporated columns to match those on the door to the building but
 the roof tiles don’t even match. Prince Charles would probably describe
 it as a carbuncle anywhere else, although I wouldn’t go that far. But 
it just doesn’t flow with the rest of the property.’

Other
 major works include rerouting the main driveway to sweep across a field
 in front of the house to give the family greater privacy.

The main gate to the house has been re-sited further down the driveway to keep away onlookers.

A garage block has been converted into accommodation for the couple’s personal protection officers and the front lawn dug up to create extra parking.

Although the cost of the works is being met privately by the Royal Family, Norfolk Police is recruiting extra armed officers to guard the property round the clock.
