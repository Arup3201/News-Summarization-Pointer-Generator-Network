The depths of Mick Philpott’s depravity were revealed yesterday in a letter he wrote from prison, boasting that if he won freedom he and his wife would celebrate by ‘raping each other’.

The note to friends detailed how he planned to get blind drunk and commit the assault straight after visiting the graves of the children he and wife Mairead had killed.

The correspondence emerged as his lawyers pleaded with a judge for a lenient sentence because the father of 17 was a ‘very good’ parent.

The court heard that he was on bail for a violent road-rage attack at the time of the house fire in which the children died.

His wife’s barrister said losing her children was a ‘sentence in itself’.

Philpott, 56, and Mairead, 32, were 
convicted on Tuesday of killing their six children. Their friend Paul 
Mosley, 46, was also found guilty of six counts of manslaughter. They 
will be sentenced this morning.

Over the past eight weeks, Nottingham 
Crown Court has heard how they set fire to their house last May as part 
of a plan to frame Philpott’s former live-in lover Lisa Willis.

She had walked out of the shared 
three-bedroom semi in Allenton, Derby, with her five children and the 
thousands of pounds in benefits they were worth to Philpott.

The fire was also set in an attempt to
get a bigger council house, a demand Philpott had infamously made six 
years earlier on the Jeremy Kyle Show.

The plan went tragically wrong, 
however, with the petrol-fuelled blaze burning out of control.

Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, all died.

Later, however, Philpott was totally remorseless.

In a letter written from prison where 
he was on remand, he boasted: ‘God, when we are free, which we will be, 
we’re all going to get p*****.

‘But me and my darling beloved wife, 
the most important thing that we will do when this happens is to spend 
the whole day with our babies, at the graveside.

Lack of remorse: Six wooden crosses mark the graves of the Philpott children which Mick Philpott intended to visit after his release from prison, but not before getting drunk first

‘We don’t care if it’s raining, gale force winds, snowing. I’m going straight up there.

‘Then we shall probably – no, we will – rape each other. Then we can all celebrate our freedom.’

Superimposed on the words were eight pink hearts, one each for him and his wife and six for the children they killed.

The letter was sent to Mick and Sharon Russell, close friends for 20 years. The couple said they were disgusted.

‘That’s his attitude, he’s highly sex driven,’ Mr Russell said. ‘I wouldn’t leave Sharon with him on his own.’

Philpott showed little genuine emotion
following the fire. He ‘loved’ being a local celebrity and was seen 
‘touching up’ his wife in the hospital where her son Duwayne was dying 
after the fire, the former friend added.

Mick and Mairead Philpott in court for the mitigation hearing yesterday

Mrs Russell said Mairead had planned a
new outfit for her children’s funeral, which she and her husband were 
later banned from attending.

‘I was quite shocked at it and said, 
“You can’t wear that.” She said, “Will it be all right for the after 
party?” It was disgusting the way they were behaving.’

Another friend, who asked not to be 
named, said Mairead got drunk on alcopops at a neighbour’s barbecue in 
the days after the fire, and showed off an £80 pair of pink trainers she
had bought with money donated by sympathetic members of the public.

In court yesterday, lawyers for the killers pleaded with Mrs Justice Thirlwall to consider mitigating circumstances.

Philpott’s lengthy criminal history 
was read out. He appeared in court a week before the blaze last year for
a road-rage attack during which he punched driver Jon Welham, 42, who 
had his daughter Emma, 13, with him in the car.

Sentencing was adjourned till today

The assault happened after Philpott 
swerved in front of him, forcing him to stop, because he believed Mr 
Welham had cut him up at a roundabout.

Philpott pleaded guilty to common 
assault but denied dangerous driving and was bailed awaiting trial. In 
1991, he received a two-year conditional discharge for headbutting a 
colleague and in 2010 was given a police caution after slapping Mairead 
and dragging her outside by her hair.

Anthony Orchard QC said Philpott’s 
conviction for stabbing his former girlfriend Kim Hill 27 times in 1978,
revealed by the Mail yesterday, was a ‘long time ago’ and said there 
was no evidence of anything like it being repeated.

But he was immediately cut off by the judge, who retorted: ‘There’s been violence in every single relationship, has there not?’

The lawyer added: ‘Despite Mr 
Philpott’s faults he was a very good father and loved those children. He
is, as is Mairead, a parent who lost six children. He’s never been able
to grieve or even to bury them.

‘He will have to live with the hatred and hostility of the press and the public for the rest of his life.’

Shaun Smith QC, for Mairead Philpott, said she was ‘an extremely good mother to all 11 children’.

‘She will be forever known as a child 
killer,’ he added, noting that she might face threats in prison because 
of the nature of her crimes.

The barrister for Paul Mosley said he continued to deny any involvement in the fire.
