A heroic father and son took down two men on Saturday night after they threatened a mother and her children with a weapon following a minor car collision.

Gary Richie, 54, and his 35-year-old son Jacob were walking past Monster Jam in Orlando, Florida with their family when they saw the ruckus around 10pm and immediately intervened.

Shelley Mae Moore, 34, had been driving her brother and her children in her minivan in bumper-to-bumper traffic when two men allegedly side-swiped her with their Ford pickup.

When she pulled up to confront them, things turned very nasty very quickly, Richie Sr. said.

Hero: Gary Richie pinned down a gunman after he threatened a mother with a weapon after she complained his friend had side-swiped her van in traffic. Richie said as soon as he saw the gun, he knew he had to act

Dramatic: An image taken by Richie's family shows him and his son on the ground, right, after police arrived and the two gunmen, left. They gave statements to police about what had happened and were released

He watched as the driver, Stephen Page, 21, apparently pulled out a gun and pointed it at the woman as he drove past. His passenger, Cory Gathings, 21, then jumped out of the truck with a shotgun, he said.

'It deteriorated really quick when the guns came out,' he told WKMG. 

'When the passenger got out, he had a shotgun. He pointed it at the van and started walking towards the van. And when he did that, that's when I rushed him and pinned him against the truck.' 

He called for his son to help take away the gun.

When police arrived on the scene, Richie held the shotgun over his head to show he was surrendering, but police drew their weapons, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Richie and his son complied with the officers' demands but Page walked over to Richie and tried to grab the shotgun back from him. Richie's son knocked Page to the ground, he said.

Arrested: Stephen Page, 21, left, was driving the pickup that allegedly hit the mother's van and pulled out a weapon as he drove past. His passenger Cory Gathings, 21, right, then allegedly jumped out with another gun

Help: Richie had help from his son, Jacob, pictured, as he tried to get the weapon from Gathings

'If [Page] had've gotten that shotgun and stood up with all those police officers with guns drawn, he might've been the lone target,' Richie told the Sentinel. 

The father and son were released after police took their statements. They did not suffer any serious injuries. 

Richie, a former member U.S. airman and a former police officer, said when he saw children in the back of the mother's van he knew he had to act.

'If I didn't do something, something bad could have happened,' he said. 'There are lots of kids and families that are jeopardized by that kind of behavior and it's just unnecessary.'

Police arrested Gathings and Page, both of Orange City, and charged them with aggravated assault. Both have since bonded out of the Orange County Jail.
