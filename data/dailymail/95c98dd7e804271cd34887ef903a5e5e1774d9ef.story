Jamie Redknapp described Manchester City's Champions League performance against CSKA Moscow as 'diabolical', claiming the players are putting Manuel Pellegrini's job under pressure.

Speaking after City's 1-2 home loss on Sky Sports, Redknapp did not hold back in his criticism of the Premier League champions.

'At times they were diabolical. World class players, and they have not won one game in this Champions League,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'It's beyond belief. This is after a weekend when they've beaten Manchester United.

'We thought they'd go on and turn it around. The performances they're giving at the moment, they're putting this manager under pressure.'

'They never got started. They never got out of the blocks. They never won a second ball. It was quite staggering.'

City can still qualify for the knock-out stages of the Champions League, but after two points from their first four matches, Pellegrini's side sit bottom of the group with Bayern Munich and Roma still to play.

Redknapp admits that he does not think they will win their next two games. 'Mathematically they can qualify, but do I look at them and think they're capable of beating Bayern Munich, or going to Roma and winning? I look at them and think, "I don't know where the next win is coming from."'

'They look like they're coasting, going through the motions. There's no spark. It looks a certainty that they're out of the Champions League, and they're out of the Capital One Cup. There's a lot of players now without any football.'
