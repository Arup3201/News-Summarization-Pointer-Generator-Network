You might think finding six double-yolk eggs in one box is about as likely as discovering a unicorn munching through a field of four-leaf clovers.

However, Marks & Spencer has cut the odds to the point where it is a certainty.

The chain is launching boxes of six extra-large eggs with every one guaranteed to have two golden, gooey yolks – a product M&S says is ‘perfect for people who think the yolk is the best bit’.

M&S is launching boxes of extra-large eggs this weekend - with the guarantee each one is a double-yolker

The company say the new boxes of double-yolkers are ‘perfect for people who think the yolk is the best bit’

In normal circumstances, the likelihood of finding just one such egg in a box is about one in 1,000, according to the British Egg Information Service (BEIS).

Consequently, the equation for finding six would theoretically be 1,000 to the power of six, which equates to an American quintillion – 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (18 zeros).

Farmers at M&S have managed to take the luck out of the equation by opting for young chickens, whose first eggs are much more likely to produce double yolks.

Any particularly large eggs from these birds are likely to have multiple yolks, so choosing out the double-yolkers becomes easier.

Finally, the eggs are then passed by hand in front of a strong light to check for the double yolk. 

The BEIS said double-yolkers almost always come from hens about 20 to 28 weeks old, whose hormone systems are not fully developed yet.

Normally the chances of finding a double-yolker like this one in a box of six eggs is just one in 1,000

A spokesman said: ‘In reality it gets its mechanics just slightly wrong. 

'You get a young bird and it comes to lay its first egg and it releases more than one egg yolk. It forms a shell around the egg and out pops a rather large egg with two egg yolks in it.’

The yolk is the tastiest and most nutritious part of the egg, because it contains high quality essential fats, vitamins and minerals, including B12, B6, A, K, E and folate.

It is also one of the few foods to naturally contain vitamin D, which is important for bones, particularly in children.

Yolks also contain most of the egg’s calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, selenium and iron.

The British free range double-yolkers, which are extra-large, are available from this weekend for £2.75 for a box of six, compared with a box of the store’s normal large free range eggs, which costs £2.
