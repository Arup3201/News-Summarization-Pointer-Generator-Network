It is a common occurrence up and down the country every day.

Groups of mothers with their children get together for a chat and a cup of tea or coffee.

But mothers who attend one weekly coffee morning have been left furious after health and safety chiefs banned hot drinks from their event.

Volunteers have been ordered to change the name of the Friday morning sessions from ‘Coffee and Play’ to just ‘Baby Play’.

Biscuits have also been replaced by healthy snacks including fruit and bread sticks.

Parents attending the Stratford Children’s Centre in Stratford-upon-Avon,  must now catch up over a plastic cup of water.

The weekly 90-minute sessions have been running for five years for children aged 18 months and under and no toddler has ever been injured in that time.

But last week Warwickshire County Council introduced the ban after it ruled hot drinks were a hazard to toddlers.

Parents have now branded the ban 'health and safety madness'.

One young mother, who did not want to be named, said: 'The hot drinks were never served in a cup or a mug.

'They were served in what I regard as a "no spill plastic safety cup" with a lid.

'There were almost like flasks, with a very small opening. Everyone is just a bit disappointed.

'I know it probably doesn’t seem much, but having a cup of tea or coffee is quite a nice social thing to do as a new mum.

'Does this mean I shouldn’t be drinking a cup of coffee in the comfort of my home?

'To me the ban is yet another example of health and safety madness.'

Children’s centres across Warwickshire can now only serve hot drinks if they are in a separate area from the toddlers.

Mum-of-two Sue Turner, 30, said: 'What the council are saying is if a parent wants a cuppa they must turn their back on their child and walk across to another area of the children’s centre to make it and drink it.

'Surely it is more dangerous to leave your child unattended than it is to have a cup of tea on a table next to you while you watch them.'

Vicky Kersey, children’s centre officer at the council, defended the ban.

She said: 'To minimise any risk of scalding a child we have introduced a hot drinks policy at all of the county’s children’s centres.

'Hot drinks can now only be served at children and baby sessions if the layout of the centre provides a separate area to consume hot drinks away from children playing.'

Caroline Loveridge, spokeswoman for the Stratford Children’s Centre added:

'All families using the centre were informed about this change of arrangements and we invited their feedback.

'The majority of responses we have received have been positive and supportive as parents understand we want to minimise the chance of any harm being caused to their child.'
