The nation's top intelligence official is declassifying three secret U.S. court opinions that reveal yet more details about how the National Security Agency has spied on Americans, it was announced on Wednesday.

The shocking documents show how the NSA inadvertently scooped up as many as 56,000 emails annually over three years, even though they were written by people with no connection to terrorism.

The court opinions also reveal how the NSA reported the error in 2011. The court then ordered the agency to find ways to limit what it collects and how long it keeps it.

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper authorized the release on Wednesday.

On
Tuesday it emerged that the NSA's surveillance network has the ability 
to spy on an incredible 75 percent of all U.S. internet communications. 

Citing current and former NSA employees, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday that the huge breadth of coverage is more than officials have publicly disclosed.

The
Journal said the agency keeps the content of some emails sent between 
U.S. citizens and also filters domestic phone calls made over the 
Internet in the hunt for foreign intelligence.

The NSA's filtering, carried out with telecom companies, looks for communications that either originate or end abroad, or are entirely foreign but happen to be passing through the United States, the paper said.

But officials told the Journal the system's broad reach makes it more likely that purely domestic communications will be incidentally intercepted and collected in the hunt for foreign ones.

In response to a request for comment,
NSA said its intelligence mission 'is centered on defeating foreign 
adversaries who aim to harm the country.

'We defend the United States from such threats while fiercely working to protect the privacy rights of U.S. persons. It's not either/or. It's both,' NSA said in an email statement to Reuters.

The information gathered by the NSA comes from phone companies, internet firms and from the monitoring of online traffic.

The captured internet material goes through large-scale filtering and processing systems before joining the other online and phone data in the main NSA databases.

From there, all the material is passed through software that spots links or patterns in the data, before being passed on to a NSA analyst, who examines the information in detail.

According to the Journal, all final reports are then stored in databases named Maui and Anchory.

Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, first disclosed details of secret U.S. programs to monitor Americans' telephone and Internet traffic earlier this summer

The Journal said that these surveillance programs show the NSA can track almost anything that happens online, so long as it is covered by a broad court order, the Journal said.
