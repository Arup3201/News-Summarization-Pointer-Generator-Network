She's only 14 days old but baby Azra has seen enough drama to last her a lifetime.

Rescuers clapped and cheered as they pulled the infant alive from the rubble of the Turkish earthquake – almost 48 hours after the disaster struck.

The youngster, whose name means 'maiden' in Arabic but also ‘help’ in Hebrew, survived despite being naked in freezing conditions. Her mother and grandmother were later plucked alive from the same collapsed building.

Safe: Medics cradle Azra after she is plucked from the rubble

The tiny baby was wrapped in a blanket and taken to hospital

Television footage showed emergency workers applauding as the baby, Azra Karaduman, was removed from the hulk of crushed concrete and metal.

A rescuer cradled the infant, who was then wrapped in a blanket and handed over to a medic amid a scrum of emergency workers and journalists.

The baby was said to be in good health but was flown to a hospital in Ankara.

And this afternoon, a ten-year-old boy was pulled alive from the rubble after an incredible 54 HOURS.

Authorities yesterday said the death toll had risen to at least 432 in Ercis and the provincial capital, Van, as a result of the 7.2-magnitude quake on Sunday.

There was a race against time to free dozens trapped inside mounds of concrete, twisted steel and construction debris.

At least nine were rescued yesterday, although many more bodies were discovered.

Authorities have warned survivors not to enter damaged buildings and thousands were spending a third night outdoors in cars or tents in near-freezing conditions, afraid to return to their homes.

The baby’s mother, Semiha, and grandmother, Gulsaadet, were huddled together with the baby clinging to her mother’s shoulder when rescuers found them, emergency worker Kadir Direk said.

There was a bakery at the ground floor of the building, which may have kept them warm, he added.

He said Azra’s mother was semi-conscious but woke when he reached her.

Amazing survival story: Baby Azra - 14 days old, naked and trapped in a collapsed building for 47 hours - is rushed to a waiting medical unit in Ercis, Turkey

Carefully carried to safety: A doctor carries Azra away from the ruins this morning. Her rescue gives hope to others whose loved ones remain missing

Double delight: Rescuers finally release the mother after plucking the baby from her arms

Family joy: Amid the terrible loss of life, Azra's grandmother is also rescued from the devastation

Azra’s uncle Senol Yigit watched the rescue from outside, sobbing: ‘It’s a miracle.’ He said: ‘I’m so happy. What can I say? We had lost hope when we first saw the building.’

Rescuer Oytun Gulpinar added: ‘Bringing them out is such happiness. I wouldn’t be happier if they gave me tons of money.’

But workers could not find the baby’s father and there were no other signs of life in the shattered building, he said. It was reported the family live in Sivas, central Turkey, but were visiting the girl’s grandmother and grandfather.

Nine-year-old Oguz Isler was also rescued along with his sister and cousin, but last night he was waiting at the foot of the same pile of debris that was his aunt’s apartment block for news of his parents who remain buried inside.

Freed: Rescuers free a teenager from a collapsed building in Ercis. Mesut Ozan Yilmaz, 18, who survived for 32 hours under the rubble of a tea house, said it was like 'the judgement day'

Cutting through: Rescue workers spent a second night cutting and digging their way through shattered buildings in the hope of freeing survivors

Tale of two cities: Residents of Ercis, made 
homeless by the quake, sit around a fire as lights illuminate a damaged 
building behind them, while rescuers dig their way into a collapsed 
building in Van

Still trapped: Yunus, a 13-year-old survivor in Ercis, remains caught in the rubble as rescuers work to free him. He was later successfully removed from the rubble and taken to hospital

Criticised: CNN Turk reported that emergency services, especially the Red Crescent service, had not provided enough shelter for displaced residents in Van and Ercis

Growing effort: Much-needed aid is being provided by several aid organisations. Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay, overseeing relief operations in Van, said: 'From today there will be nothing our people lack'

Young survivor: A boy cries after being pulled from the remains of an internet cafe in Ercis. While the toddler sustained minor injuries, others in the cafe were not as lucky

Quake prone: Turkey is particularly susceptible to seismic activity, with four tectonic plates within its borders. Sunday's quake occurred along the North Anatolian fault, which runs along the top of the country
