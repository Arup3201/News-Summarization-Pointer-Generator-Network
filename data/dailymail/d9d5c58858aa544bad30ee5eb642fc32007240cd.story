A young koala is in recovery after suffering second-degree partial thickness burns on all four of his paws from the devastating bushfires in South Australia.

Heartbreaking images of Jeremy the koala have gone viral since he was treated at Australian Marine, Wildlife Research and Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) yesterday.

It was a timely reminder that the bushfires have also destroyed the homes of our native wildlife.

While carers say it's too early to predict whether Jeremy will make a full recovery, he is currently 'doing very well and is in great spirits'.

Aaron Machado from AMWRRO told Daily Mail Australia Jeremy, aged about two-years-old, is still in a critical condition.

'He's in a lot of pain and severely dehydrated but he's stabilised and doing okay for now,' he said.

'So he's being closely monitored by carers at this stage.

'We're unsure whether we can expect a full recovery from him. But he certainly has the potential.'
