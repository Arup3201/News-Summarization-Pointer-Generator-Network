Britain has dodged a double-dip recession but the crisis in the eurozone is deepening with unemployment at a record high, according to the latest figures.

The UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of the year, having shrunk by the same amount at the end of 2011, the British Chambers of Commerce said.

The return to growth – which means Britain has avoided a new recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of decline – came as factory output rose at its fastest pace for ten months in March.

But the BCC business lobby group said 
the recovery was still ‘much too slow’ and called for ‘forceful’ 
measures to kickstart the economy.

It comes after the respected Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development last week declared Britain was back in recession.

‘The UK economy is still facing huge challenges and the recovery is much too slow,’ said BCC director general John Longworth.

‘The UK has the potential to recover but to achieve that the Government has to set businesses free to grow.’

Soaring: Unemployment in the 17-nation eurozone today soared to 
17.1million - the highest level since the currency was founded in 1999 
(bottom line). The top line shows unemployment across the 27-nation 
European Union where there are 24.5million people out of work

The BCC’s quarterly economic survey, published today, predicts growth of
just 0.6 per cent in Britain this year – compared to the 0.8 per cent 
expected by the Treasury.

It warned that high oil and food prices are hitting family budgets and 
added that ‘the unresolved problems in the eurozone may trigger new 
upheavals later this year’.

Eurostat, the official statistics agency in Brussels, said unemployment 
in the 17 countries that adopted the euro had hit its highest since the 
currency was launched in 1999.

The jobless rate rose to 10.8 per cent in February, from 10.7 per cent 
the previous month, with 17.1million people out of work, nearly 
1.5million more than a year ago.

Unemployment is 8.4 per cent in 
Britain. In Spain, youth unemployment hit an eye-watering 50.5 per cent –
meaning that more than half of young Spaniards who want a job cannot 
find work.

It reinforced concerns that the debt-riddled eurozone is back in 
recession after gross domestic product fell 0.3 per cent in the final 
three months of 2011.

Separate figures show a bigger-than-expected manufacturing downturn in 
the eurozone. Economic research group Markit said its main index of 
factory output – where anything below 50 represents contraction – fell 
to a three-month low of 47.7 in March.

The slump in the troubled periphery spread to Germany and France, the 
region’s powerhouse economies, according to the report. Howard Archer, 
chief European and UK economist at think-tank IHS Global Insight, said: 
‘It looks odds-on that eurozone GDP contracted again in the first 
quarter of 2012.

‘And the prospects for the second quarter of 2012 currently hardly look rosy.’ 
But hopes are rising that Britain has avoided recession, despite last week’s gloomy report by the OECD.

Markit said its index of factory output for the UK rose to a 10-month 
high of 52.1 in March, as strong exports to Africa, south-east Asia and 
Japan offset weak demand in Europe.

Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturing organisation EEF, said:
‘Despite further evidence of weakness in eurozone markets, UK 
manufacturers are looking beyond this and securing orders growth in 
non-traditional emerging markets.’ 

The BCC urged ministers to take 
‘radical’ steps to bolster growth, including a new war on red tape and 
creating a state-backed bank to boost lending to small businesses.

‘The results of the quarterly economic survey point to a welcome but 
modest improvement in the economic situation,’ said BCC chief economist 
David Kern.

‘The UK economy will likely avoid a recession. However, growth is likely
to remain low for some time, and a return to a more normal pace is 
unlikely until 2013.

‘Every effort must be made to boost growth and empower the private sector to create jobs.’

Labour shadow Treasury minister Owen Smith MP said: ‘After flatlining 
since George Osborne’s spending review in 2010, our economy should be 
doing more than just recovering the output lost at the end of last 
year.’

Senior MPs have attacked David  Cameron’s handling of the European Union, saying he got nothing in return for letting eurozone countries proceed with a new fiscal union.

The European Scrutiny Committee denounced a new treaty of 25 European nations as ‘illegal’ and said Mr Cameron was right to veto British involvement.

But the committee has found that the Government failed to use its leverage to extract meaningful concessions.

A report published today has found that Mr Cameron and his advisers are acting in a ‘profoundly unwise’ manner by giving the project the green light.

The treaty will see 25 EU countries – all EU nations except the UK and the Czechs – submit to tough new spending limits.

But the committee found that the  fiscal compact ‘does little towards solving the Eurozone crisis, other perhaps than providing some comfort to international markets’.

The UK Government first said it would be wrong for the 25 countries to use EU institutions such as the European Court of Justice to police the agreement, when they are supposed to be controlled by all 27 EU countries. But Mr Cameron gave ground last month, reserving Britain’s right to complain if the institutions are used in a way that would undermine the European single market.

The committee said that if the Government believes the new treaty is unlawful if should say so and extract something in return for nodding it through.

It concludes: ‘The Government has made clear that it has reservations about the legality of what has been done, but the question of what it intends to do remains unsatisfactorily unresolved.’

The Foreign Office declined to comment.
