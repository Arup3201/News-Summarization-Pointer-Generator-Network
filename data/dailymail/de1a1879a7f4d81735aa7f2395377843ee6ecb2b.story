Chainsaw-wielding psychopaths, creaking boards and rats scuttling through pools of blood - these are America's scariest houses.

Each crumbling old home will strike terror into the heart in its own spine-tingling way, whether it is haunted by a creepy clown, a headless horseman or a 25ft python.

Fear fans have become addicted to seeking out the biggest screams, spookiest special effects, eeriest history and most chilling attention to detail across the U.S.

Now a definitive list of the 13 most 
skin-crawling haunted houses lays out the most horrifying spots to visit
if you want to experience true terror.

Topping the list by website hauntworld.com
is the 13th Gate in LA, where visitors must crawl through a burning 
crematory oven and feel their way through a dim, snake-infested cave.

At
Netherworld in Atlanta, defenceless tourists will encounter a wailing 
banshee, a crawling eye and a sunken city that rises towards the skies.

The
brilliantly named Cutting Edge in Texas is built on the gruesome 
location of a meat-packing plant while Ohio invites foolhardy 
holidaymakers to The Dent Schoolhouse, which was shut down in the 1950s 
after a homicidal janitor who lived in the basement was caught.

In Houston, you can check out Texas's oldest graveyard at Nightmare on the Bayou,
where crazed actors, Hollywood quality props and lifelike animatronics 
combine to create one of weirdest and most frightening spots in the 
States.

So take a trip on a
mind-bending hayride, dodge repulsive monsters and fend off vicious 
beasts as you tiptoe your way through this jitter-inducing maze.
