A duck which was shot through the neck with a crossbow bolt has managed to evade capture for the past ten days, as the RSPCA investigate who was responsible for the 'despicable' act.

The animal charity said it was trying to catch those who shot the duck at the Dearne Valley Country Park, in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

The duck, which is still able to fly and eat, is being monitored by RSPCA officers who are attempting to catch it to treat its injuries.

Investigation: The RSPCA is trying to find those responsible for shooting the duck, which is still able to fly and eat, with the crossbow bolt

Evaded capture: The animal charity has been trying to catch the duck for the last ten days to treat its injuries

An RSPCA spokeswoman said it was appealing for information about the crime.

She said: 'Obviously it's a despicable thing to do and we will do whatever we can to catch those responsible.'

The injured duck was reported to the RSPCA around ten days ago and has evaded capture since that time.

A spokeswoman for the charity said: 'We have been making attempts to catch the duck but it's actually able to fly so it's proving quite difficult.

'We are monitoring it and some local fishermen are keeping an eye on it as well.

'We do want to get the duck and get the crossbow bolt removed.'

The maximum sentence for anyone convicted under the Wildlife and Countryside Act is a Â£5,000 fine or a six-month jail sentence.
