Toughening up: The threshold for a 'good' pass - currently a C - will be brought closer to a B, in line with standards in the world's top education systems.

The number of top GCSE grades awarded will be halved in a shake-up  to end an era of soaring pass rates.

A new top ‘grade nine’ will go to entrants who show ‘really exceptional’ performance – half the number who achieve an A* in the present system.

A greater range of lower grades will make it easier for employers and colleges to distinguish between middle and top-performing school-leavers.

The threshold for a ‘good’ GCSE pass – currently a grade C – will be brought closer to a B, in line with standards in the world’s highest-achieving education systems.

Improvements in grading techniques will also help examiners end grade inflation.

The plans – published today by qualifications regulator Ofqual – are part of sweeping reforms to public exams instigated by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

They will affect maths and English GCSEs awarded in 2017 and several other key subjects the following year.

Ofqual confirmed that alphabetic grades A* to G will be replaced by numbers, with nine being the highest.

Chief executive Glenys Stacey said the reforms would restore public confidence in GCSEs, after years of concern over numbers of A grades, dumbed down content and repeated resits.

A Department for Education source said: ‘Rising results, year after year, masked the fact that standards were stagnating.

In future the top grade will be awarded only for top performance.

‘We hope these reforms will raise standards and restore trust in the exam system for families, for employers and for the pupils themselves.’

Under the proposals, entrants will find it tougher to achieve the top grades and more will end up  with the existing ‘U’ for fail.

The current top two grades – A and A* – will be replaced with three in the new system – seven, eight and nine, with nine going to only about one in 30 pupils – half those who gain A*s under the current system.

Of those who passed nearly 7 per cent of exams at A* in England last year, only 3 to 4 per cent would have merited the new grade.

‘This would make the standard of performance required for the award of a grade nine really exceptional,’ the department source said.

The numerical GCSE grading scale will be familiar to many as the system once used to grade O-levels.

But under the Gove system a nine will be the highest grade, whereas a nine at O-level was the lowest.

Before 1975, pass grades at O-level were numbered one to six, with grades seven to nine considered a fail. Schools were told the number, but grades were officially recorded as pass or fail only.

Five official grades – the letters A to E – were introduced in 1975, with A to C classed as a pass  and D and E fail grades.

In 1965 the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) was brought in alongside O-level GCE chiefly for lower-achieving pupils at secondary moderns.

O-levels and CSEs were replaced by GCSEs in the late 1980s.

The current C grade will be equivalent to grade four but will no longer be seen as the benchmark for GCSE achievement.

Instead, grade five – which will be pitched up to two-thirds of a grade higher than C – will be the new de facto ‘pass’.

Ofqual said grade five would be pegged to standards in high-performing countries and regions such as Singapore, Shanghai, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands.

Changes to GCSEs already confirmed include an end to modular tests in most subjects, with traditional end-of-course exams becoming the ‘default method of assessment’ – to stop pupils entering early or multiple times in the hope of eventually gaining a good grade.

‘Controlled assessments’ – coursework done in class – will be minimised amid concerns  that teachers were able to massage results.

In a further proposal, a sample of pupils each year – possibly several thousand – would sit an English and maths test just before their GCSEs to help examiners ensure grade-setting is robust and accurate and to limit grade inflation.
