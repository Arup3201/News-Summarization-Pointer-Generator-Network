Sam Allardyce has urged the West Ham faithful to give QPR’s former Hammers a warm reception when the two sides clash on Sunday.

Rob Green, Rio Ferdinand and Bobby Zamora have collectively made more than 500 appearances for the Hammers while Harry Redknapp was manager for six seasons from 1994.

The quartet are all plying their trade on the other side of the capital but Allardyce believes their time in east London should not be forgotten when they return to Upton Park.

Rio Ferdinand is one of three current QPR players who have formerly played for West Ham

‘They should get a warm reception as all three of them were here for a considerable amount of time, they weren’t short-term stays,’ he said. ‘We would like them to be very miserable at the end of the game though.

‘The year I had Robert Green when he helped us get back in to the Premier League, he was a great professional and we all know about Rio.

‘Harry has been managing longer than me — one of the few left who has. I think they will all come back with an extra determination to show everyone what they can still do.’ 

Rob Green joined West Ham from Norwich in 2006 and went on to make 219 appearances for the club

Ferdinand and Steven Caulker were two big names to arrive at Loftus Road but the team have conceded 13 goals in six games - the most in the division - and questions have been asked about the pair’s performances. 

‘It’s a team game, I don’t think you can point out those two individuals,’ said Allardyce. ‘They have had a transition because they’ve changed the way they have played - they thought the back three would work and now they’ve moved to a back four.

‘They will be talking about how much protection they are getting - or not getting - from the midfield players to stop those goals going in.’  

Bobby Zamora joined West Ham from Tottenham and scored 30 goals for them in 130 games

West Ham entered the weekend 13th in the table but only three points above QPR and the bottom three.

Allardyce says it is never too early for supporters to grow frustrated and believes it is vitally important to maintain a gap above the relegation spots.

‘The pressure affects us all if you’re in and around the bottom, even at this stage of the season,’ he said. ‘There’s no give or take whether it’s the start, middle or end of the season so you have to avoid ever being there if you can.

‘The only way of doing that is to make sure you win and, if you don’t win, make sure you draw — if we had drawn rather than lost some of our games we’d be two or three points better than we are now. That kind of gap can be important to take the pressure off, so it’s almost a six-pointer on Sunday.’
