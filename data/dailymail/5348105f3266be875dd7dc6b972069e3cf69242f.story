Depraved mothers who gave up their lives in the West to live under the rule of Islamic State terrorists in Syria are taking photographs of their newborn children sleeping alongside handguns and assault rifles in a sickening game of one-upmanship on social media.

Featuring titles such as 'The Little Terrorist' and 'Generation Kilafah', the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents' extremism in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa.

While some shots feature children so young that they are unlikely to be aware of the significance of the photographs, another shows a masked young girl of around three-years-old dressed in full combat gear, carrying an AK47 and raising her index figure to make a well-known jihadi gesture.

Although the images were posted on Twitter over the past year, they form part of a new study of the everyday lives and, inevitably, deaths of the young Western women who chose to live under ISIS.

One photograph in the study, which was published on Buzzfeed, shows a woman calling herself Umm Abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boy aged about five dressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle. 

She identifies the child as her son's 'lil best mate' and suggests he has already been killed, adding that she hope her own child 'grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him'.

Another photograph, this time posted by a woman calling herself Umm Usama, shows a one-year-old girl sleeping alongside a small, black pistol and is captioned 'Even my baby girl goes 2 bed with her gun #generationkhilafah'.

A similar image was posted on Twitter showing a newborn baby fast asleep in a plastic crate and covered in a Hello Kitty blanket. The otherwise adorable photograph is ruined, however, by the fact an AK47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby's bed.

The image was posted on Twitter by a man claiming to be the child's father and was captioned: 'The Little Terrorist #Hammam was born in the land of the caliphate, I ask God Almighty to make him one of the Caliphate’s soldiers.'

The study reveals numerous other images of young children being exploited for shocking photographs that are later posted by their twisted parents on social media.

The majority show young boys and girls dressed in combat clothing and brandishing weapons and are captioned with horrific messages by their parents wishing the children a hasty death.

Others show young boys and girls wearing clothing daubed in the chilling black and white ISIS logo, stating that the children are being 'raised as lions' who will one day fight against the West.

The overall effect is to instill fear in the West that even if the current generation of ISIS jihadis are killed, there will still be generation after generation of bloodthirsty, brainwashed terrorists ready to fight and die in order to carry out atrocities against innocent people.

The use of sickening images of gun toting children also allows the often very young militant parents to brag and boast about how 'hardcore' they are, distancing themselves from Western ideals of parenthood and encouraging them to take part in a pathetic one-upmanship on social media.

The woman who posted the image said that the boys' mothers  are now raising them to be the next generation of anti-Western terrorists ready to fight and die for ISIS

Two young British women posted this photograph on Twitter saying they were living in ISIS' capital city Raqqa

The study of ISIS wives was released as an Australian jihadist widow shared a series of propaganda pictures she says shows her 'five star jihad' lifestyle - and says she and other female jihadists are 'thirsty' for the blood of her former countrymen.

In photographs posted to a Twitter account believed to belong to former Melbourne woman Zehra Duman, several women are pictured standing under an Islamic State flag, reclining against a clean white BMW M5, wielding machine guns and dressed from head to toe in black Islamic dress.

In one tweet, Duman said: 'US + Australia, how does it feel that all 5 of us were born n raised in your lands, & now here thirsty for ur blood?'

Another image of five women standing under an Islamic State flag is captioned: 'Can't mess with my clique. From the land down under, to the land of Khilafah. Thats the Aussie spirit.' 

Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. 

It also  featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'.

Daily Mail Australia reported in January that Duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed. 'You won the race!' she tweeted, describing him as a 'green bird' - the term used to describe a so-called martyr.

Life as normal: Women living under the rule of ISIS in Syria regularly post photographs of the food they are eating online and boasting that electricity in Raqqa is continuing to run

Another photograph of food posted online by ISIS militants was captioned ' Breakfast in the Islamic State'

Despite the brutal treatment of men and women living under the rule of the Islamic State in Syria, thousands of Westerners have made the journey to the terrorists' de facto Syrian capital Raqqa.

Yesterday it emerged that yet another young woman had fled the UK in a bid to reach ISIS. 

Photographed in a police cell, the 21-year-old jihadi suspect named by officials as Jaila Nadra H was arrested by Turkish security services as she waited to board a bus in Ankara.

They believe the Muslim convert from East London was attempting to travel to the lawless and often porous border with Syria.

The woman faces being deported back to the UK where she is likely to be arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. 

Sky News reports she is being held pending deportation hearings. One official said she was expected to be deported 'soon'. 

Last night her family expressed shock at her arrest.  A cousin told the Daily Mail: 'She converted to Islam several years ago and we hear little from her... Her father has recently come out of hospital where he was undergoing chemotherapy. It is hard to believe this could happen.' 

Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. 

Five star jihad: The ISIS wives study emerged as a Twitter account understood to belong to Zehra Duman posted a series of photographs of jihadist women 'from Australia and the US' posing with a BMW M5

Alarming: Zehra Duman posted this photograph to social media with the caption: '5 star jihad. M5 (the BMW) in the land of sham (Syria) he he '

Turkish authorities are holding a 21-year-old British woman named by officials as Jaila Nadra H (pictured) on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria and into Islamic State territory to join the terror group

The arrest comes days after three British teenagers were arrested at the airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul and thrown out of the country. 

The young men, two aged 17 and a third aged 19, were questioned by counter-terrorism police on their return to the UK and released on bail. 

They have told their families they wanted to go to Syria to 'help', and denied subscribing to the beliefs of militant Islamists.

Last month three British girls – Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 – travelled to Turkey. They were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, a close friend, who travelled to Syria last December.

There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the warzone in Syria and Iraq. 

Last week David Cameron said everyone has a responsibility to examine why people should want to join Islamic State. 

Turkey is an important ally to the West as European states attempt to stem the flow of foreign fighters bolstering the ranks of Islamic State.

It has been criticised for allowing fighters to cross the border into Syria but in return has asked why other countries allow militants to travel in the first place.
