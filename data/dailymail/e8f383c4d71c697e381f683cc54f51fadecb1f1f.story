Prolific criminal: David James Archer, from Rhyl, North Wales, appeared in court for an incredible 266th time on Monday, where he admitted theft

A recovering heroin addict has appeared in court for an incredible 266th time, just three days after he was handed his 265th conviction.

David James Archer, from Rhyl, North Wales, was arrested in Llandudno on Sunday afternoon after he was spotted stealing a belt from a clothes and camping shop in Mostyn Street.

When he appeared before magistrates on Monday it was Archer’s 266th appearance on a theft charge.

The 59-year-old admitted theft when he appeared from custody at Caernarfon magistrates court yesterday, but sentence was adjourned.

The court heard Archer’s 265th appearance before a court was only last Friday when he was handed a six-week jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, by magistrates at Wrexham.

Bench chairman Peter Lunt Williams said they were looking at a suspended sentence and securing probation service support for Archer.

He was granted conditional bail and he will appear before magistrates at Prestatyn next week.

Diane Williams, prosecuting, said at about 2.25pm staff at the Trespass store saw him enter the shop and then leave.

CCTV cameras saw him put something around his waist. It turned out to be a belt costing £2.99 he had stolen from the shop.

Ms Williams said: 'When approached by police he claimed he had bought it from a friend for £5.

'But enquiries with the shop revealed it was from their stock.'

Huw Roberts, defending, said it was a difficult task to defend a man who had such a lengthy criminal record.

He said: 'He has just come out of a 30-year heroin addiction and he is anxious to change his ways.

'He has had no probation service intervention for more than eight years and he would benefit from their support.'

Mr Roberts added Archer had obtained a flat in Rhyl and kept a dog and was anxious to return to the address.

He said: 'He is putting some structure into his life.'
