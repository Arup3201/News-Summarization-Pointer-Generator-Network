The Lib Dems signed up to government spending plans in private but now 'slag them off' in public, George Osborne claimed today as a coalition row erupted over the scale of cuts needed.

The Chancellor hit back at Lib Dem Vince Cable who has claimed Tory plans to dramatically reduce spending were 'wholly unrealistic'.

Nick Clegg was also forced to deny trying to distance himself from his own government after snubbing Mr Osborne's Autumn Statement for a photocall in Cornwall.

Chancellor George Osborne, pictured at a Bently Motors factory in Crewe today, hit back at Lib Dem criticism of his spending plans

Mr Osborne used his statement yesterday to reveal the deficit has halved since 2010.

But the Office for Budget Responsibility warned only 40 per cent of the cuts needed have been made so far.

The Tories have made clear they would seek to balance the books through spending cuts alone, with cutting welfare the top priority.

But Mr Clegg has branded the approach 'complete and utter nonsense' and insisted there must also be tax rises.

And Mr Cable said he had made 'very, very clear' his opposition to Tory plans to achieve the goal by cutting departmental budgets and welfare, without increasing taxes on the wealthy.

The Business Secretary said his Conservative colleagues wanted to cut public spending 'rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable' and their plans were 'simply not realisable'.

The Lib Dem criticism triggered a furious response from Mr Osborne. He told Sky News: 'In private, they sign up to all these decisions and then in public they slag them off. But that's for them to explain to you.'

Mr Osborne also mocked Mr Clegg's decision to visit flood defences in Penzance instead of being in the Commons yesterday.

'He can choose to be anywhere he wants in the country,' Mr Osborne said.

Mr Clegg denied trying to distance himself from the measures announced yesterday. Speaking during his weekly phone-in on LBC, he said: 'I've been doing autumn statements and budgets for five years now and sitting dutifully there. And, by the way, of course I have worked on this meticulously for weeks.

'Everything in that Autumn Statement is in there because we have agreed it and I fully support it.

'But, then I had a choice - did I listen to Ed Balls in the House of Commons or did I go out and talk to normal people?'

Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts

Spending by government departments will fall to just 12 per cent of GDP. If health, schools and foreign aid are protected, other areas will be severely squeezed 

George Osborne clashed with Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys

George Osborne today hit out at the BBC’s ‘hyperbolic’ coverage of spending cuts, accusing the broadcaster of predicting the world would fall in.

The Chancellor clashed with Radio 4 Today programme host John Humphrys about questions on the state of the country’s finances.

Mr Osborne said: ‘When I woke up this morning and turned on the Today programme I felt like I was listening to a rewind of a tape from 2010.

‘You had BBC correspondents saying Britain is returning to a sort of George Orwell world of The Road to Wigan Pier.’

Orwell’s bleak book chronicled poverty, hunger and social injustice in the north of England in the 1930s.

Mr Osborne repeatedly hit back at Humphrys’ ‘nonsense’ questioning, adding: ‘I would have thought the BBC would have learned from the last four years that its totally hyperbolic coverage of spending cuts has not been matched by what has actually happened.

‘I had all that when you interviewed me four years, and has the world fallen in? No it hasn’t.

‘The British economy is growing and the deficit is half what it was when I was doing those interviews.’

Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC of being 'utterly negative' about the government's flagship welfare reforms, and challenged claims by Today present Mishal Husain that it had been ‘dogged’ by problems.

Asked why he ever attended the Commons, Mr Clegg replied: 'That's a good question, actually.'

Pressed on whether he had 'propped up' the Tories, he said: 'No, it's not propped up, far from it. I've steered it.'

He insisted: 'It is a Liberal Democrat Autumn Statement just as much as anything else and this economic recovery wouldn't be happening without the Liberal Democrats.

'And, by the way, all this complete nonsense tittle-tattle about Vince Cable here or Danny Alexander there. What Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and indeed myself have been saying for ages is that we proudly stand together in this coalition Government to sort out the mess created by Ed Balls.

'As for the future, clearly we have a completely different approach to the Conservatives.'

Government sources said Mr Cable had 'erupted' during yesterday's Cabinet meeting and told fellow Lib Dems, including Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander, that they had not signed up to the Conservatives' spending plans beyond the general election.

Mr Osborne remains committed to balancing the budget – spending less than is raised in tax – by 2017-18.

But to do so will require deep spending cuts. Total government spending will fall to just 35.2 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 – the lowest level for 80 years.

It marks a dramatic decline from 45.3 per cent in 2009-10, the last year of the Labour government. In the mid-1970s state spending accounted for almost half of the entire economy.

Just 40 per cent of the spending cuts needed have been made so far, with the remaining 60 per cent to come in the next five years.

The Tories and Lib Dems committed in the Coalition to protecting health, schools and foreign aid spending.

It means other departments face much deeper cuts of up to 50 per cent to find the money needed to eradicate the deficit.

The Office for Budget Responsibility expects NHS spending to rise from £108.4billion this year to £110.2billion in 2019-20.

But spending on unprotected budgets like defence, transport, business and councils will fall from £147.1billion to just £85.6billion.

During the decade to 2020, spending per person on unprotected areas will fall from £3,020 to just £1,290.

The OBR said: 'The implied cuts... during the next Parliament would pose a significant challenge if they were confirmed as firm policy, one that would be all the greater if existing protections were maintained.'
