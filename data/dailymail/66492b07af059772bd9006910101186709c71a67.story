Louis van Gaal's Holland players relaxed with their young kids after the light training run on Saturday that followed their ruthless demolition of World Cup holders Spain.

Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben only had eyes for victory as they each bagged braces on Friday night in their group B opener that saw Spain humbled 5-1. But when it came to training at their Rio de Janeiro base it was all about keeping things light.

Van Persie, who scored a sensational Superman-like header and a true poacher's goal in doggedly sniping the ball from Spain keeper Iker Casillas, showed his softer side playing with his daughter Dina on the training pitch.

His team-mates also took time out to include their kids in proceedings as Manchester United's new boss van Gaal strives to provide them the perfect balance of professional and personal during their campaign.

Before the match, a replay of the 2010 final, van Gaal broke from tradition and allowed his players time to catch up with their wives and girlfriends.

'My principle is the overall picture,' Van Gaal was quoted telling the Mirror. 'The total person. The player.

'His brain and his psyche plays a part. And the psyche is influenced by his environment.

'So on Thursday and this morning I gave permission for the wives to visit the hotel and so the players could be happy.

'But that doesnâ€™t mean this is the reason for our victory.'
