An upstate New York surgeon who had been accused of faking thousands of surgeries over five years has pleaded guilty to one count of healthcare fraud.

Dr. Spyros Panos, formerly an orthopedic surgeon at Saint Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., changed his plea to guilty last week in federal court in White Plains.

He faces 10 years in federal prison and has been fined $250,000. He will also pay the government $5 million as restitution, ABC News reported.

Dr. Spyros Panos performed 'phantom surgeries' on dozens of patients and is blamed for at least one known death

The surgeon has been released on bail and will be sentenced in March 2013.

Panos
read a statement in court confessing: 'I willingly and knowingly 
executed a scheme to defraud the health care benefit programs by causing
my medical practice, Mid-Hudson Medical Group in Dutchess County, New 
York, to submit bills to insurance providers that included inaccurate 
billing codes in order to obtain higher insurance payments than that 
would have been paid for the procedures I actually performed.'

Panos' wife, mother and two brothers joined him in court, who all cried as he read his statement.

In
July, Panos and his hospital were facing hundreds of malpractice 
lawsuits over accusations he sliced people open and sewed them back up 
without actually performing any procedures, or that he performed the 
wrong surgery

Scheduling
as many as 22 surgeries a day, an almost unheard of workload, Panos was
billing for work never completed and his out of control greed resulted 
in the death of a 76-year-old woman, one of the lawsuits alleged.

Debra
Nenni McNamee alleges that in 2009 Panos was to have performed surgery 
on her 76-year-old mother Constance Nenni’s left knee to repair damage 
caused by arthritis, according to ABC. Panos is said to have described the procedure as ‘a simple in and out.’

The
procedure involved a small camera being inserted into Nenni’s knee to 
help clean out any dead or damaged tissue found, a fairly routine 
procedure. McNamee claims that less than 24 hours after the surgery, 
Nenni died of a pulmonary embolism said to have been caused by a blood 
clot that broke free and blocked the lung’s main artery, according to 
reports.

Though not a 
common occurrence from knee surgery, older adults are more prone to such
complications from any type of surgery. The Dutchess County (NY) 
medical examiner’s report, purportedly, is what did Panos in.

Debra Nenni said after his court appearance: 'I don't feel sorry for him at all. My family has been crying for four years.'

Panos allegedly had fudged all the post-surgery notes related to the six procedures he had performed on the family patriarch.

The
medical examiner's autopsy showed no evidence that he had ever removed 
torn cartilage, smoothed areas of excess wear or removed soft tissue 
from within the knee joint – he simply opened and closed her knee 
without so much as a single bit of repair, the Poughkeepsie Journal originally reported.

‘He
put her under anesthesia, placed the scope in her knee and then closed 
her up without performing any surgery,’ Brian Brown, McNamee’s lawyer 
told ABC. ‘The reports showed no hardware in place and, certainly, no 
evidence of a total knee reconstruction.’

McNamee’s
case wasn’t a one-off, according to several reports. Former patients 
have brought a total of 250 malpractice suits against Mid-Hudson Medical
Group, parent of Saint Francis and Vassar Hospitals, and Panos, 
according to reports.

In another instance, Panos was accused of having performed the wrong surgery.

Barbara
Murphy was to have a broken collarbone fixed by Panos in 2010, instead 
he operated on her rotator cuff as if it was broken, despite there being
no evidence to suggest that procedure was necessary, she told the 
Journal.
