Victoria Beckham is set to further cement her career as a fashion designer by opening her own boutique in London’s upmarket Mayfair.

After months of negotiations, the 39-year-old former Spice Girl has signed a deal to open the shop, selling her collections of clothing and handbags.

The location - in Dover Street, just a short walk from Old  Bond Street - places Victoria at the heart of the capital’s fashion district.

Victoria first hinted at her desire to open a flagship store for her brand in April, when she told British Vogue that London would be the perfect location.

She said at the time: ‘This is where I want to have my first store. I’d like to do something that is really new, really fresh.  Something a little bit conceptual – but not too much.’

Her designs have proved popular with the likes of Beyonce and Gwyneth Paltrow, but have previously only been available online, in fashion outlets and department stores.

A source close to Victoria said: ‘She’s really excited about getting things moving quickly.

‘Obviously there is still a lot to do, but the hope is to open the store properly early next year with one of the biggest fashion parties of the year.’

It was reported last week that Victoria and husband David's business empire now boasts earnings of almost £100,000 a day

The news comes after it was reported last week that Victoria and husband David’s business empire now boasts earnings of almost £100,000 a day.

The three companies which handle their family’s branding empire recorded combined turnover of more than £35 million a year, according to Companies House documents.
