The world’s ‘best’ airport is planning to get even better with a massive glass and steel structure that is being hailed as the terminal of the future.

Construction is underway on Singapore’s Jewel Changi Airport, which will boast the world’s tallest indoor waterfall, a large indoor park with native trees and plants, and walking trails, in addition to improved check-ins and transfers for passengers.

Known as Project Jewel, the £726million terminal is being constructed next to the existing Terminal 1, which is undergoing a major overhaul to bring it into the 21st century and increase its capacity to 24 million passengers a year from 17.7 million.

Construction got underway this month on Singapore’s £726million Jewel Changi Airport, which will boast a glass and steel design

The breathtaking 130-ft ‘Rain Vortex’ is expected to be the world’s tallest indoor waterfall once it is complete

When it opens in 2018, Jewel will have five storeys above ground and five below ground, with a total footprint of more than 1.4 million square feet.

By bringing elements of the outdoors inside, the round-shaped terminal will be unlike anything that has been built before.

In addition to high-end shops and a 130-room hotel operated by YOTEL, the joint venture between Changi Airport Group (CAG) and CapitaMalls Asia has a big focus on nature with an aim of boosting Singapore’s appeal as a stopover point for travellers.

Designed by a team led by world-renowned architect Moshe Safdie, the visually stunning terminal features a glass and steel facade.

Officials describe Jewel as an ‘idyllic valley of verdant landscaping and waterfalls’ where visitors can go for a hike in air-conditioned comfort

Officials said Jewel will be the first in Singapore to seamlessly integrate lush greenery with other attractions and facilities within the same building.

It will house one of the largest indoor collections of plants in Singapore and one of its top attractions will be Forest Valley, a huge five-storey garden filled with thousands of trees, plants, ferns and shrubs.

There will be four different gardens and an incredible 130-ft ‘Rain Vortex’ that is expected to be the world’s tallest indoor waterfall once it is complete.

It will be located at the core of the complex and at night will transform into a light and sound show with special lighting effects.

Jewel will be seamlessly integrated with Terminal 1’s arrival hall and it will include facilities for faster check-ins and luggage drops.

Changi Airport was named the world’s best airport in 2014 by the World Airport Awards.

Lee Seow Hiang, CAG’s chief executive officer and chairman of Jewel Changi Airport Devt Pte. Ltd, said: ‘An important hallmark of Changi Airport’s growth over the past thirty-odd years has been continual change and innovation.

‘In charting the airport’s future, this spirit continues to underpin our strategy. Faced with intensifying competition, we challenged ourselves to rethink what an airport can be – not just as a gateway for flights, but as a tourism destination on its own.’

Philip Yim, chief executive officer of Jewel Changi Airport Trustee Pte Ltd, said: ‘Apart from distinctive design, Jewel will break new ground with its unique mix of attractions, retail and airport facilities, integrated in a way like never before to create a slew of different experiences in a single visit.

‘Located at the doorstep of the award-winning Changi Airport, it will be a place where Singapore and the World meet. For international travellers, Jewel will be an exciting tourist destination. For Singaporeans, it will be a playground near home where they can share many happy moments with their loved ones.’
