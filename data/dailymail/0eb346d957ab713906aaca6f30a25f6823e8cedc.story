The family of a 93-year-old man claim they were prevented from being at his bedside during his final moments because of security guards at a New Jersey hospital.

When Angelo Romeo's daughter and grandson accidentally used the wrong door in the hospital on November 23, security guards gave them a lecture about 'correct procedures'.

The delay meant that by the time they reached Mr Romeo's room, the nurses and doctors were waiting outside to tell them it was too late, and Mr Romeo had already died.

Last goodbye: John Urbaniak with his grandfather Angelo Romeo, who he helped care for

'They really need to revise their security policies - and at least have some empathy and compassion,' Mr Romeo's grandson, John Urbaniak, said.

The 33-year-old, who lived with his grandfather and helped care for him, told NJ.com that more than a week after the family's loss, they were still waiting to hear from the New Brunswick hospital's Patient Advocacy department.

The traumatic experience began when Mr Urbaniak and his mother Fran rushed to the critical care unit in Robert Wood John University Hospital after hearing that Mr Romeo's health was failing.

A security guard buzzed them through the first door, but as they entered an elevator a second security guard yelled that they couldn't use it and reached inside to stop the doors closing.

'I said, "My grandfather’s dying! We just got a call". And she didn’t even care,' he said.

She forced them to use their hospital's main entrance, but when they reached the lobby three security guards waiting there accused them of assault because Mr Urbaniak had knocked the hand of the guard who tried to stop the elevator.

Despair: The family say the security were heavy handed at their time of grief

'He didn’t assault her,' Mr Urbaniak's mother, Fran, said. 'My son and I are not threatening-looking. We’re both little.'

The pair told the guards they were rushing to be with a dying relative and handed over their ID, but they claimed that a security official ordered them to sit down and lectured them for several minutes.

'This is not how you 
conduct yourself in a hospital,' he told them, according to Mr Urbaniak.

Mother and son were then escorted through the hospital to where Mr Romeo was being cared for.

When they arrived a doctor and the nurses were waiting outside the room. 'They said, "We're sorry. He just passed,' Mr Urbaniak said.

The grieving 33-year-old said he then verbally lashed out at the security guards, telling them they had robbed him of his final minutes with his grandfather.

He claimed the guard responded by saying: 'This is not our fault. This is your fault.'

Mr Urbaniak expressed his frustration at their treatment on the hospital's Facebook page, telling the hospital: 'I never got a chance to say goodbye to him thanks to your heartless security.'

'In our time of deep sorrow and grief, we were showed no sympathy, no compassion, no care for the loss of someone so close to us. We were treated like animals and shown no mercy whatsoever - and for no reason at all,' he said.

He added that even after being told his grandfather had died, the security guards continued to follow the family, waiting outside the relatives' room as they comforted each other, and following Mr Urbaniak when he asked a nurse when the family could see the body.

In a tribute to his beloved grandfather, Mr Urbaniak explained how Mr Romeo survived being a prisoner of war in the Second World War and then came to the U.S. from Italy without a cent to his name.

He worked hard to raise the money to bring his wife and two daughters out a few months later, and was described as being a gentle and kind-hearted man who loved gardening and animals.

Two days before his death, the widower had been fitted with a pacemaker and appeared to be recovering by Saturday night.

Because he had appeared to be doing well, Mr Urbaniak and his parents went out to dinner, leaving Mr Romeo chatting happily to a careworker.

'He waved bye to me, he was happy,' 
Fran Urbaniak said. But shortly after he took a turn for the worse and 
the carer called the family and told them to rush to the hospital.

The hospital responded to Mr Urbaniak's Facebook complaint, and offered its condolences.

In
a statement sent to Mail Online, a spokesman said: 'We extend our 
deepest sympathies to the Romeo and Urbaniak families at this time. We 
strive to provide a welcoming and safe environment for all patients and 
visitors at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and take the 
families’ concerns very seriously.'

Complaint: John Urbaniak claims his family were treated without compassion

It added that Mr Urbaniak and his mother had been redirected to the main lobby for security reasons and said 'the family was not detained'.

'Our security personnel took this action in the spirit of maintaining a safe and secure environment for all patients and visitors.'

The spokesman added that after speaking with the family and completing a review, the hospital will determine if changes to security policies or enhanced training is needed.
