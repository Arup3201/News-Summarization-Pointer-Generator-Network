Apple is believed to have delayed plans to produce a 12.9inch 'iPad Pro' so it can keep up with demand for its 5.5inch iPhone 6 plus handset.

The firm confirmed it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 units during the launch weekend, with recent estimates suggesting it may have sold more than 21 million units in the first two weeks - with over 4 million iPhone 6 units reserved in China.

It is believed the larger model, the 6 Plus, has proved more popular than expected, causing manufacturers to scramble to produce enough screens.

Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads this month.

'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac.

'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says. 

'The top priority for the supply chain is to meet the overwhelming demand for the larger screen iPhones,' a source told the Wall Street Journal. 

'The output of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus remains unsatisfactory,' an unidentified person familiar with Apple's supply chain said. 

'It would be challenging for display makers to split resources and spend a few months to ramp up production for a new larger screen iPad now.'

'Everyone is busy with the new iPhones, Foxconn's bread and butter. Chairman [Terry Gou] has also gone to the Zhengzhou site to monitor the production closely,' a Foxconn official said. 

At the Zhengzhou plant alone, more than 200,000 workers are making iPhone 6 units — overall, Foxconn has well over 1 million workers.

The bigger 12.9-inch iPad Pro tablet was supposed to enter production in December, it has been claimed.

It comes as Apple is to unveil new iPads and new Mac computers on 16th October at its California HQ.

The new gadgets could go on sale on the 24 October - with new Mac software, called Yosemite, available as a free download even earlier.  

Last week, rumours suggested Apple was putting the finishing touches to a new version of it's iPad Air - including a gold version. 

The small event is likely to be in stark contrast to the star-studded launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which saw U2 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band's new album.

An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air has surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button.

According to Tinhte.vn  the device comes in at just 7 millimeters thick, the same thickness as the iPhone 6.

An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air has surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button. 

In addition to a redesigned speaker grille, the unit also sports a small hole where the mute/orientation lock switch appears on existing iPad units. 

The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline.

Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company's new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours. 

The iPads have a new sleek design and are thinner

New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, 'people familiar with the matter' told Bloomberg.

The new iPads are also predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6.

Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality.  

The code states that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.'

However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. 

Apple Pay has only been announced in the US, so if the iPads do get the feature, it may be limited to only American buyers.  

Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models.

The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. 

Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion).

The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini, and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen.

The new iPads are expected to have a rounded design similar to the recently released iPhone 6

The new iPads are also expected to include Touch ID sensors

Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. 

In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a 'budget' version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped.

The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

The new line of iMacs is rumoured to have ultra high-resolution Retina Displays, a thin profile and faster processors as well as improved Wi-Fi antennas.

The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite.
