This is the dramatic moment an inebriated man miraculously escaped death after falling under the wheels of a moving train in Manchester. 

The reveller sways alongside the train at Manchester Piccadilly station before collapsing against the carriage while it starts to move. 

He then loses his balance, falls and tumbles underneath the train behind an unperturbed passenger.

As he staggers along the platform he falls against the side of a train that starts to move

As he falls, he trips further to the ground as the train begins to move away from the station

The man then slips under the train - miraculously he was not killed in the incident in July 2013

He was then pulled to safety and the clip has been shared as part of an awareness campaign by Network Rail

The incident is featured on a video of perilous falls on platforms released by Network Rail as part of a new campaign called 'Lend a Helping Hand' urging travellers to take extra care in stations. 

In the last year there were 1,490 reported incidents of trips where passengers boarded trains. This represents an 18 per cent rise from 2009. 

Many incidents have occurred after heavy drinking sessions.  

Network Rail's operations managing director Robin Gisby said: 'We do everything we can to make moving around our stations as easy and safe as possible but our teams deal with far too many people who have injured themselves where it appears alcohol has been a factor.' 

Neal Lawson, director of operations and maintenance services said: 'Everybody has heard the phrase "Mind the Gap". 

'We're minding that gap every day, looking at how we can make that gap as safe as possible for the millions that rely on a safe and punctual train service.'
