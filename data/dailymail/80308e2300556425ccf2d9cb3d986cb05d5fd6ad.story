Thousands of marchers descended on parliament today – in the shape of little paper puppet protesters.

In the first protest of its kind, more than 8,000 ‘mini marchers’ went to Parliament Square, including celebrities such as Jonathan Ross, Louis Smith and Tulisa Contostavlos.

Each paper protestor represented one signature on a petition calling on David Cameron to put smallholder farmers at the heart of its trade policy ahead of the G8 summit in June.

The protest was the first of its kind and featured celebrities such as Jonathan Ross, Amanda Holden and Eddie Izzard

More than 8000 people signed the petition and had 'min marchers' made

The march outside parliament was intended to raise awareness of the difficulties experience by farmers in developing countries

Each person was able to design their own ‘mini marcher’ that would represent them on the day.This marks the start of the second week of Fairtrade Fortnight, designed to raise awareness of the plight of farmers in developing countries.

They were made in partnership with start-up company Foldable.ME.

Cheryl McGechie, Director of Public Engagement at the Fairtrade Foundation, said: 'Our march on Parliament brings together all of our supporters in an engaging way to show they care about combating unfair trade practices.

‘We know that with the right support, smallholder farmers can be central to delivering a better, fairer food system for all.'

Other well-known faces in attendance were Gok Wan, Amanda Holden, Harry Hill, Tynchy Stider, Richard Hammond and Dermot O’Leary.

One of the celebrities leading the march, Jonathan Ross said: 'By signing up I've been able to create a mini Jonathan who'll join the march to Parliament next month for a fairer deal for small farmers - he's actually more handsome than me!'

The Fairtrade Foundation benefits 1.5million farmers and workers worldwide, with more than 4,500 products carrying the Fairtrade badge.

The protest was held by the Fairtrade Foundation that has helped more than 1.5 million farmers and workers around the world

The majority of the 'mini marchers' were members of the public that are concerned about the governments approach to small farms

Estimated retail sales of Fairtrade products in 2012 reached £1.57 billion, a 19 per cent increase on 2011.

Frank Olok, Coordinator for the Malawi Fairtrade Network adds: 'The aim of this campaign is to raise awareness about the daily plight of farmers in developing countries who are amongst the poorest people in the world.

'Despite growing most of the world’s food they still struggle to make a sustainable living, get access to finance and improve their and their communities economic, and, social situation.

Each of the 8000 paper puppets was made by start up company Foldable.Me

'That’s why I would urge people to sign the petition calling on the UK government to use the G8 to lobby for global action.’

The final list of names will be delivered to David Cameron at World Fair Trade Day in May before the G8 meeting the following month.
