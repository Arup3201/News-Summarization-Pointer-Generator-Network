After meeting and marrying at the age of 17, there wasn't much in life that Max and LaVere Robinson didn't do together and that includes dying.

The couple passed away just three days apart at the end of August.

101-year-old Max died on August 26 and was followed by his 100-year-old wife three days later on August 29.

Defying the odds: LaVere and Max Robinson married at age 17 in 1929 and died just three days apart this past August

While Max had recently suffered a fall, his death came as a surprise to the family.

LaVere's was even more surprising three days later as there was no 'real reason' she passed away. 

Max met LaVere when they were both 17 at their parent's Mormon church in Oakland, California.

They loved each other so much that the two eloped on November 1, 1929 in the midst of the Great Depression - without their parent's permission.

That move would be controversial in the church today, and it really was then.

'Needless to say, when our parents found out they weren't too happy with us,' LaVere told the LDS Church News in 2009. 'My father said it would never last.'

Her father was wrong on that assessment. The couple never parted, remaining together for 83 years of marriage.

'They had an amazing relationship, right up to the end,' granddaughter Lisa Goeas told the National Review. 'They were very much in love with each other and very happy.'

Their great partnership helped them start a wholesale grocery business, a real-estate office and an insurance company. 

Together they had three daughters and
 now their family has grown to include ten grandchildren, 27 
great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.

While Max began to fade in his later years due to Alzheimer's, the one person he never forgot was LaVere.

'He definitely knew she she was. He would go find her every night to give her a kiss,' Goeas said.

Even
 after so many years together, he never once took her for granted often 
telling his grandchildren how lucky he was to have married 'the most 
beautiful woman in the world'.
