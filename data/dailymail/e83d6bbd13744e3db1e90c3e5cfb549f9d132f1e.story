Boston bombing survivor Jeff Bauman has revealed he is writing a book about his experiences which will be published in April 2014 - the anniversary of the deadly blast.

The 27-year-old New Hampshire native lost both his lower legs in the April 15 attack and has since been learning to walk on prosthetics and has started a new career a motivational speaker.

A photograph taken moments after the blast shows Bauman gray-faced with nothing but exposed bone below his knees and has become an iconic image of the terror inflicted on the city that day.

Despite the trauma, he has overcome unimaginable adversities to remain positive and Grand Central Publishing will next year publish a book entitled 'Stronger' about his experiences.

'We are very excited about this project,' Matthew Ballast, the Vice President and Director of Publicity for Grand Central, told TODAY.com.

'He's telling his story for the first time - his experiences, his recovery, and how the city of Boston helped him recover.'

Bauman, who was working to pay off his student loans at the deli counter in Costco before the life-changing blast, is working with a co-writer on the book.

He went to the marathon waiting to see his girlfriend cross the finish line when was close to one of the explosive-filled backpacks allegedly placed by the Tsarnaev brothers.

Bauman was thrown by the force of the blast and opened his eyes to find himself in a pool of blood. He saw one of his friends look at his legs in horror and looked down to see his limbs were shredded.

A man applied tourniquets to his legs and then he was scooped into a wheelchair by Carlos Arredondo - a man in a cowboy hat - who helped rush him to an ambulance.

The men have become firm friends since the blast - which left three people dead - and have been pictured side-by-side in hospital and as guests at Red Sox games.

On the day of the bombings, Bauman underwent an emergency amputation to remove his legs at the knees, and two days later, flesh was amputated until four inches above the knees.

Authorities have praised Bauman, who 
also lost much of his hearing in the blast, as key to stopping Tsarnaev 
and his brother Dzhokhar after he helped identify them as the suspects.

'Even in the ambulance ride I was trying to say something, trying to say, like, "I knew who did it, I knew what went on",' he said in an earlier interview with NBC News. 'And then I think they were kind of thrown back by that.'

Bauman added that he is now looking forward and, while he could wonder how differently he could have acted that day to avoid the blast, there is no point.

Instead, he is focusing on his recovery, which has impressed doctors.

'It's insane,' he said. 'I'm a quick healer. They were calling me 'Wolverine'.'
