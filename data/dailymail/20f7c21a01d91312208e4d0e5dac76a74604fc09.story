A 23-year-old former anorexic  says finding love with her 40-year-old neighbour saved her life.

Banker Nina McArthur shrank to little more than five stone after becoming stressed while working for a graduate scheme bank job.

The former triathlete, who weighed a healthy eight-and-a-half stone throughout her teens, started obsessing over calories after starting the demanding occupation.

Her periods stopped and at her worst she was so thin she drank endless cups of tea and coffee 'to keep warm'.

But after moving into her own flat, Miss McArthur started dating her neighbour, IT manager Martin Nash, who helped her on the road to recovery.

Nina McArthur was able to recover from anorexia after boyfriend Martin Nash, 40, convinced her to seek help

Miss McArthur was at  low point in her life when she met Mr Nash in 2013. Her periods had stopped and her work colleagues were worried about her health. Mr Nash convinced her to go to the doctor for help

Miss McArthur, from Newton Heath, Manchester, said: 'It's his support that has really got me through. 

'It sounds dramatic but, without him I think I would have ended up dead.'

Miss McArthur had always been sporty and loved swimming, and competed in her first triathalon aged nine.

The pair formed a friendship in June 2013 after Miss McArthur moved out of her parent's home. 

'I'd had a few hard years,' she said. 'After competing in triathlons from the age of nine, I stopped when I developed hyperthermia during a race in 2009.

'I decided to focus my energy on studying and started my bank job. I found it incredibly stressful and began limiting what I ate.

'When I was training as an athlete I'd always been quite strict with my diet. Then a coach told me if I lost weight I'd run quicker and I limited it even more.

'I started taking those dangerous eating habits even further and began skipping meals.'

But Miss McArthur's diet soon got more severe, and her weight plummeted to just six stone.

'Mum would try and force me to eat my favourite childhood foods like corn beef stew and jam on toast, but the thought made me sick,' she said.

Now she has recovered, Miss McArthur says she is enjoying life. 'I've been promoted at work and I've recently moved in with Martin. We're very settled and he makes me smile everyday,' she said

Miss Nash said at her worst she looked like a 'walking skeleton' when she weighed 5st. She is pictured battling the illness (left) and now (right), weighing nearly eight stone

'It wasn't that I was desperate to be skinny, I was desperate to be in control. I was so thin I hadn't had a period since I was 18.

'It got pretty extreme. I would not eat all day if I was drinking with mates in the evening.'

After collapsing on a work training course in April 2011, she went to her GP and was advised to go to an outpatient clinic.

But she refused to go, wanting to recover herself. Slowly she started eating more and her weight eventually crept up to seven-and-a-half stone.

She believed she had recovered, but after meeting a man who competed in triathlons, she was encouraged to play sport again.

She began starving herself and training on tiny amounts of food.

She said: 'I started to look like a walking skeleton. 

'My boyfriend encouraged me to put on weight, but it was no use and we broke up after a year together.'

It was then that the anorexia started to dominate her life.

She said: 'I moved out on my own and fell to five and half stone. I had no energy, couldn't concentrate and kept fainting.

'If I went shopping I'd have to buy children's clothes, though most of the time I tried to cover my body in baggy tops.

'Though it was clear I had a problem, I pretended I was okay. I'd take photographs of myself surrounded by food and put them on social media.

'Sometimes I'd put a huge meal on the table and take a picture of it.

Miss McArthur said Mr Nash came to visit her for her 23rd birthday, spent in hospital. 'It was actually one of the most special birthdays I have ever had,' she said. The pair are pictured now Miss McNash has recovered

Miss McArthur has now written a blog to share her story with others. She is pictured during her battle with the illness - when she would post pictures of herself with food to fool worried friends and family

'I wanted people to think I was eating normally. But my secret was impossible to hide.'

Not only were her work colleagues worried, but when her periods completely stopped, Miss McArthur began to worry about how her anorexia was damaging her health.

Shorty afterwards, Miss McArthur met Martin Nash, who lived two flats beneath her.

'At first we were just friends,' she said. 'But over time, we started spending more and more time together. 

'He was concerned about me and started inviting me over for dinner. I'd starve all day if I was going round, but at least I was eating something.'

In January 2014, weighing little more than five stone, Miss McArthur collapsed at work.

'I knew then I needed to get sorted. Martin became my rock.

'He'd make me feel normal and take me out for coffee and cake. I became so close to his family, they were my extended support network.

'He took me to the GP who said my weight was dangerously low and that I was suffering from liver damage.

'Because of that he referred me for an outpatient appointment, which Martin accompanied me to.

'Friendship quickly turned into a relationship, he supported me every step of the way.'

Miss McArthur credits Mr Nash with her recovery. She said: 'He loved me when I was at my worst, and I don't think I'd be here if it wasn't for him'

A week before her 23rd birthday Miss McArthur became a patient at The Priory Hospital, Cheadle Royal.

It was there she began writing her blog, Nina's Writing Retreat, to tell others about her progress.

In it, she recalls how Martin came to visit her on her birthday.

Writing on her blog, she said: 'It was actually one of the most special birthdays I have ever had.

Martin brought me flowers and a travel scrabble board to play in the evening and was allowed to take me over to John Lewis café for an hour for a coffee.

'My 90-year-old Nana visited to give me a great big hug and numerous messages of love and support were received from family and friends.

'I finally wanted to be kind to myself again and began to understand why I had previously acted the way I did.

'Luckily, I realised that I wanted to get better.'

Miss McArthur was put on a high calorie diet, and within 10 weeks she'd put on two stone.

She said: 'Initially it was very difficult, but I kept going.

'As I grew I began to love my body, and my new shape. I didn't want to punish myself anymore.'

Now Miss McArthur weighs nearly eight stone, and has turned over a new leaf.

She said: 'I've been promoted at work and I've recently moved in with Martin. We're very settled and he makes me smile every day.

'He loved me when I was at my worst, and I don't think I'd be here if it wasn't for him.'
