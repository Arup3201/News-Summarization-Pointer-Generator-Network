President Barack Obama again offered words of comfort to the nation as he spoke at an emotional memorial service for the victims of the Fort Hood shooting.

'Their passing shakes our soul,' Obama said on Wednesday of the three men gunned down at the Texas base last week.

Obama, who met with the relatives of 
the victims before he spoke, said he was there to honor their loved ones
 and offer whatever comfort he can.

He said that the nation is drawing strength from them as the tragedy reminds the country of the deadly mass shooting on the sprawling Army post in 2009.

'It is love, tested by tragedy, that brings us together again,' Obama said. 'This tragedy tears a wound still raw from four years ago.

'For you, for your families, no words are equal to your loss. We are here on behalf of the American people to honor your loved ones and offer whatever comfort we can.'

Officials say Spc. Ivan Lopez fatally shot three soldiers and wounded 16 others before killing himself a week ago at the Texas military base. 

Army investigators are still piecing 
together exactly what led to Lopez's deadly, eight-minute rampage on the same sprawling post where an Army psychiatrist unloaded on
 his comrades five years earlier.

Investigators believe Lopez had an argument with another soldier before the shooting.

Obama
 and first lady Michelle Obama arrived at Fort Hood late on Wednesday 
morning. Flags were lowered to half-staff at the sprawling Army base, 
where Obama met with victims' relatives.

Among
 the victims was Army Sergeant Timothy Owens, 37, a recently married 
native of Effingham, Illinois, who was shot in the chest at close range,
 his mother-in-law told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Sgt.
 First Class Danny Ferguson, 39, from Florida, had just returned from 
Afghanistan and died while trying to barricade a door to keep the 
shooter away, his fiancée and fellow soldier Kristen Haley told Tampa 
broadcaster WTSP-TV. She was nearby when the shooting started.

'He held that door shut because it 
wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would be bullet proof, but apparently 
they're not,' Haley told News 10. 'If he wasn't the one standing there 
holding those doors closed, that shooter would have been able to get 
through and shoot everyone else.'

The third fatality was Carlos Lazaney, 38, of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, the city's mayor told NBC News on Friday.

The
 suspected shooter Lopez enlisted in 2008 and had served two tours of 
duty abroad, including four months in Iraq in 2011, military officials 
said. He had no direct involvement in combat and had not been wounded.

The memorial took at the same spot on the base where Obama eulogized victims of another mass shooting in 2009. In that tragedy, another soldier killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others.

Those close to Obama say he sees his role after a tragedy as fulfilling a ministerial function for the nation.

Valerie Jarrett, Obama's senior 
adviser and longtime friend, said although it's painful for Obama, he 
understands the importance for the president to show leadership, empathy
 and strength in times of crisis, and for him to spend time with each 
family member affected.

'It's
 hard because it's deeply personal for him,' Jarrett said in an 
interview. 'He identifies as a father, as a husband, as a son, as a 
family member.'

The last time Obama came to Fort Hood, he told residents here that the 13 lives they lost would endure, their legacies safeguarded by the nation whose protection they had made their life's work.

'Every evening that the sun sets on a tranquil town, every dawn that a flag is unfurled, every moment that an American enjoys life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness - that is their legacy,' Obama said.
