Different year same old problems for Arsenal as 2015 opened amid the sort of defensive chaos which has become an unwelcome trademark of Arsene Wenger's team.

Wojciech Szczesny was the chief culprit by the Solent, directly responsible for both goals, as Southampton strengthened their grip on a place in the top-four with a deserved victory.

Szczesny abandoned his goal with a mindless charge for the first which was quite magnificently converted from a tight angle by Sadio Mane and, for the second, the keeper toed the ball straight to Dusan Tadic in another manic moment.

Ronald Koeman described Tadic's strike as a 'New Year gift' and, after conceding it, Szczesny reached for his water bottle and took a long swig, perhaps wishing it contained something stronger.

'It's unfortunate but I don't want to make too much of it today,' said Wenger, although he did confirm back-up keeper David Ospina would start in the FA Cup tie against Hull on Sunday. This had always been the plan, apparently.

Szczesny might be grateful for the mental break from keeping goal behind a team which folded to surrender a three-goal lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League and again to concede a late equaliser at Liverpool last month.

Injuries and instability have not helped but the mishaps at Southampton came with a first-choice back four in position - and the defeat could easily have been heavier.

Graziano Pelle dominated Laurent Koscielny throughout the game. Twice Pelle hit the woodwork and was also thwarted by a goal-line clearance by Mathieu Debuchy after Tadic had intercepted an under-hit Koscielny back-pass which left Szczesny scrambling around on his hands and knees yet again.

Southampton's midfield were too strong for Francis Coquelin and Calum Chambers, the inexperienced pair who did not perform badly but lacked the authority and confidence to convert possession into quick and efficient service for the front four.

Arsenal offered very little beyond a 10-minute flurry at the end and the ever-impressive menace of Alexis Sanchez – and yet they had clear chances at key moments which might have changed the game's outcome.

It was still goalless when Tomas Rosicky set up Santi Cazorla, who was unmarked in front of goal but unable to angle his effort away from Fraser Forster, who pushed it clear. Early in the second half, the Saints keeper made an even better save, low to his left, to deny Sanchez an equaliser.

'The defence was outstanding and Fraser made great saves,' purred Koeman, after reinforcing his team's unexpected position inside the top four.

At the other end of the pitch, Szczesny's goal was under attack from the opening minutes when Pelle beat Koscielny in the air to reach a cross from Tadic and nod it against the post. Moments later, the big Italian striker outfoxed Koscielny again but his effort was blocked.

This was Mathieu Debuchy’s first defeat in 13 games as an Arsenal player. 

Southampton took the lead 11 minutes before half-time. Mane displayed terrific pace and determination to evade Koscielny and win the race to a long pass from James Ward-Prowse, which had inexplicably also lured Szczesny out of his goal.

From where he collected the pass, wide on the right, Mane checked the ball onto his left foot, ignored the calls from Pelle in the centre, and took aim with a curling shot which just evaded the outstretched leg of Per Mertesacker as he raced back towards his own goal.

It was a delightful, precision finish, tarnished somewhat when Mane's right knee seemed to buckle under a mob of jubilant team-mates. The Senegal forward tried to continue but had to be replaced before half-time by Harrison Reed.

'He was in too much pain,' said Koeman. 'We had to change him but we don't know exactly what is wrong, or if he will be available for the Sunday in the FA Cup or for the Africa Cup of Nations for his country.'

In the few minutes while playing on lame, Mane still managed to create a chance for Ward-Prowse to extend the lead, but Szczesny went some way towards making amends for his earlier mistake by blocking the low drive with his feet.

The approach for Southampton's second was much like the first with a long pass into the channel between left back Kieran Gibbs and centre half Koscielny.

It was delivered on this occasion by Victor Wanyama and expertly brought under control by Steven Davis, who then applied a second touch even better than his first by rolling an inviting low cross into the Arsenal goalmouth.

Davis might as well have rolled a live grenade across the turf, the way panic descended.

Debuchy cut out the cross but dropped the ball dead in front of goal and froze as Sczcesny blundered in, attempting to clear but only stabbing a pass to Tadic, who scored.

Pelle hit the woodwork again, beating Koscielny at the near post to another fine cross from Ryan Bertrand on the left, and Ward-Prowse smashed the rebound over.

Debuchy then cleared off his own line before Arsenal summoned their too-little-too-late finish.

Sanchez charged forward and drew a foul from Florin Gardos, which could easily have been interpreted by referee Craig Pawson as a denial of a clear goal-scoring opportunity.

Gardos got lucky, took a yellow card and Sanchez glanced the top of the net from the free-kick. 'It was a definite red card,' said Wenger. 'Only the referee can explain why he did not give it.'

This decision was not, however, the reason for Arsenal's fifth defeat of the Barclays Premier League campaign or the reason why they have ground to make up to extend their 17-year run in the Champions League.
