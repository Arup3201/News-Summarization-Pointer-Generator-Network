Blur bassist Alex James is planning to launch a new drinks brand called Britpop.

The musician appears set on releasing the beverages under a name associated with the rock movement his band started in the 1990s.

The 45-year-old's application for the drinks brand trademark was published for consultation by the Intellectual Property Office last Friday.

He would join a long line of musicians 
who have entered the drinks market, following in the footsteps of bands 
such as Iron Maiden and Madness.

It is not explicitly stated what kind of drink James is hoping to launch, and the beverage could be alcoholic or non-alcoholic.

The term Britpop was popularised in the 1990s to describe the British music scene dominated by Blur and rival band Oasis.

Britpop is a term that emerged in the early 1990s to describe the British music genre of the time, which was dominated by Blur and rival band Oasis.

Bands such as Suede, Supergrass and Pulp were also associated with the term.

Britpop music was largely influenced by older British guitar music, with bands citing the Kinks, the Beatles and the Smiths as influential.

The Britpop movement was considered as directly at odds with grunge music, which was also popular at the time.

Although still primarily renowned for his musical accolades, in recent years James has entered the food market by launching a range of cheeses.

He owns a number of trademarks, including Goddess, Figgy Pudding and Little Wallop, and sells them under the range name, Alex James Presents.

He began selling cheeses after moving to a farmhouse in the Cotswolds and, in 2008, won a Best Goats' Cheese honour at the British Cheese Awards. Two year later, he was chosen to be a judge on the awards.

Despite this success, Asda stopped selling his range of cheeses in 2012 â€“ just a year after taking them on.

In 2011, James brought together his two great loves by launching the Alex James Presents Harvest, a food and music festival held on his Oxfordshire farm.

James now hosts The Big Feastival, run in conjunction with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, on his land.
