Powerful winds in the Pacific Ocean, which have driven surface heat deep underwater, could be the reason behind the current ‘pause’ in global warming.

This is according to a joint Australian and U.S. study which has looked at why there has been a slowdown in the planet’s global average surface temperature over the past decade.

Their research shows that trade winds in central and eastern parts of the Pacific have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean's depths, reducing the amount of heat in the atmosphere.

Shown here are the global monthly mean sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies from 1961-90. Sea surface temperature is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface. An anomaly is a departure from average conditions. Some scientists believe winds in central and eastern parts of the Pacific have caused warm surface water to sink to the ocean's depths

Last year, scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said the pace of temperature rise at the Earth's surface had slowed over the past 15 years.

This is despite the fact concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased to levels that are unprecedented in at least 800,000 years

The latest study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, said stronger Pacific trade winds- had made ocean circulation at the Equator speed up.

This schematic shows the trends in temperature and ocean atmosphere circulation in the Pacific over the past two decades. Colour shading shows observed temperature trends (°C per decade) during 1992-2011 at the sea surface. The bold and thin arrows show an overall acceleration of the Pacific Ocean moving warm, surface waters (indicated by the blue arrow) to below 700 metres beneath the surface

Scientists claim one of the causes of the pause in sea-surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water. They believe this exchange is occurring between warm, surface waters and cold, deep waters below 700 metres

Scientists claim one of the causes of the‘plateau’ in sea-surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water.

They believe this exchange is occurring between warm, surface waters and cold, deep waters below 700 metres – as if the warming is ‘hiding’ underwater. 

Easterly trade winds of the Pacific Ocean have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths.

Stronger trade winds blowing from South America to Australia have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1°C and 0.2°C,

This would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years.

The warm water won’t hide below the surface forever: scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators, such as sea level or ocean circulation.

This pattern of easterly winds, which spans the tropics, has moved heat deeper into the ocean and brought cooler water to the surface.

The winds have also helped drive cooling in other ocean regions.

‘We show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming,’ said the study, led by scientists from the University of New South Wales in Australia.

‘The net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 0.1-0.2 °C, which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming since 2001.’

The study's authors, including scientists from other research centres and universities in the U.S., Hawaii and Australia, used weather forecasting and satellite data and climate models to make their conclusions.

‘This hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade winds trends continue, however, rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate,’ the study said.

‘If the anomalously strong trade winds begin to abate in the next few years, the model suggests the present hiatus will be short-lived, with rapid warming set to resume soon after the wind trends reverse,’ it added.

Commenting on the study, Richard Allan, professor of climate science at Britain's University of Reading, said: ‘These changes are temporarily masking the effects of man-made global warming.’

The fact that temperatures have risen more slowly in the past 15 years despite rising greenhouse gas emissions has emboldened sceptics who challenge the evidence for man-made climate change and question the need for urgent action.

The IPCC does not expect the hiatus to last and has said temperatures from 2016-35 were likely to be 0.3-0.7°C warmer than in 1986-2005.

‘More than 93 per cent of the warming of the planet since 1970 is found in the ocean,’ said Steve Rintoul at Australia's CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research and lead author of the chapter on oceans in the IPCC's latest climate report.

‘If we want to understand and track the evolution of climate change we need to look in the oceans. The oceans have continued to warm unabated, even during the recent 'hiatus' in warming of surface temperature.’

Climate scientists say such pauses in warming occur regularly throughout history and can last for up to 20 years – but cannot be predicted.

They add that the warm water won’t hide below the surface forever. Scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators, such as sea level or ocean circulation.
