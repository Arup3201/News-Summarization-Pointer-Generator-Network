He was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he remains in serious condition but he is expected to survive.

Police said a group of men were arguing on the platform when the man was stabbed, NBC reported.

Police swarmed the scene on Wednesday as the morning commute got underway and stood guard at the subway entrance, which has been taped off.

Subway trains will be bypassing the stop this morning.

Authorities
 had also taped off a section of the block, where the street was strewn 
with a collection of items, including a pile of clothes, a shopping bag 
from Mood Fabrics and a bowler hat.

The crime comes just a week after three people were hurt in early-morning stabbings in the city.
