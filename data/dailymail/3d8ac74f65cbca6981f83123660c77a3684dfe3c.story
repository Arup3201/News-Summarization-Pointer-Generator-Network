As rock music’s greatest sex symbol over 50 years, Mick Jagger has always been notorious for his treatment of his wives and girlfriends, as distinct from those Rolling Stones groupies he bedded by the thousand.

Though suicide attempts have been a constant motif in Jagger’s prodigious love life, until now his relationships seemed to have left few scars on him.

His first serious girlfriend was Chrissie Shrimpton, the younger sister of Sixties supermodel Jean, whom he met when he was 19 and a student at the London School of Economics.

At first, he was besotted and they planned to marry. But Jagger’s growing stardom — and notoriety — created an increasing gulf between them. In 1966, he brutally dumped her for convent-educated pop singer Marianne Faithfull.

Alone in their London flat, the distraught Chrissie took an overdose of sleeping pills. Jagger found her just in time but, to avoid media publicity, his management had Chrissie taken to hospital in a plain van, checked in under a false name and then, in a private clinic, she was sedated and held a virtual prisoner until her parents reclaimed her.

In those days, before palimony agreements, Jagger walked away without giving her a penny. Years later, when it was (mistakenly) reported she intended to sell some of his love letters, the ever-controlling Jagger threatened her with legal action unless she sent them back.

And so, Marianne Faithfull, the daughter of an Austrian baroness, became his muse, introducing the gauche young rocker to literature, ballet and opera.

She also achieved infamy when Jagger and fellow Stone Keith Richards were busted for drug possession and briefly imprisoned in 1967. She was found by police seated next to Jagger wearing nothing but a fur rug.

Not surprisingly, life with a super-vain superstar was no easier on Marianne.

In 1969, while with Jagger in Australia, she swallowed 50 sleeping tablets, washing them down with hot chocolate.

Jagger found her just in time, as he had Chrissie Shrimpton. But for Marianne, it was the start of a downward spiral into heavy drug use and alcoholism.

After leaving Jagger, she was penniless, became a heroin addict and lived rough in Soho.

Next up was the Nicaraguan-born Bianca Perez-Mora Macias, who became his first wife, though she later would say bitterly that her marriage ‘ended’ on her wedding day.

Indeed, on the morning of their 1971 wedding in St Tropez in the South of France, before the world’s media, Jagger made a scene because Bianca refused to sign a pre-nuptial agreement.

Thereafter, she felt herself to be little more than another member of his permanent court of gophers and sycophants, whom she nicknamed ‘the Nazi state’.

The marriage was effectively over after a year, though the couple stayed together for the sake of their daughter, Jade.

When Bianca finally divorced Jagger in 1979, smart work by his lawyers kept her settlement at only around £1 million.

Bianca’s replacement, the Texan supermodel Jerry Hall — whom Jagger stole from fellow pop idol Bryan Ferry — at first seemed successful at bringing Jumping Jack Flash to heel.

Not only did she have money of her own, meaning his precious fortune was safe, but she turned a blind eye to the affairs with much younger women that the priapic Jagger continued to have into middle age.

Jerry was desperate to marry, even packing a wedding dress in hope every time she went on a Stones tour.

But it was not until she’d borne him two children that he relented and agreed to marry her in a Balinese woodcarver’s hut in 1990.

Yet the old devil’s infidelities still continued, including a rumoured affair with the future French First Lady, Carla Bruni.

The breaking point with Jerry was his affair with the Brazilian model Luciana Morad, which resulted in a son, Lucas. When Jerry sued for divorce, having by then had four children by Jagger, he crassly claimed their Balinese wedding was legally invalid, and so the marriage was annulled ‘by mutual agreement’.

Jagger is reported to be 'devastated' at losing L'Wren Scott. They were together for 13 years

Jerry Hall’s rumoured settlement of £4.5 million made her the first Jagger ex to describe him as ‘very, very generous’.

With L’Wren Scott, he was thought to have found someone with whom to grow old comfortably. She was wealthy, independent and didn’t demand commitment.

Yet even after all their years together, Jagger, the perpetual adolescent, still referred to her only as ‘someone I’m sort of seeing’.

Now, though, he is reported to be ‘devastated’ at losing her.

That emotion will be one that the serial heart-breaker has never experienced before.
