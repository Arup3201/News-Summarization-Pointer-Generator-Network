A family of six were kicked out of a Butlin's swimming pool because the mother had 'too many children' with her.

Kelly Noble, 34, took her five children with her to the family-friendly resort in Skegness, Lincolnshire, as a treat for her 14-year-old autistic son, Lewis, earlier this month.

But just minutes after the children started playing in the pool on the second day of their holiday, a lifeguard ordered them to leave over health and safety fears.

Kelly Noble, her son Lewis, 14 and her other children (l-r) Jonny Tougher 9, Jake Tougher 7, Kadee Mattley 5, Lishay Mattley, 10, were kicked out of a Butlin's swimming pool because she had 'too many children'

Ms Noble was told that there were not enough adults to care for the children - Lewis, Jonny, nine, Jake, seven, daughter Lishay, 10, and stepdaughter Kadee, five, safely because she was on her own. 

Despite Ms Noble being within Butlin's rules by supervising a maximum of two children under the age of eight, a lifeguard insisted the five children had to get out of the water because of fears that she would not be able to care for her autistic son, as well as two under-eights. 

A furious Ms Noble said: 'We'd all been in the swimming pool on the first day, and the children had been saying how brilliant it was. 

'They really wanted to go again the next day, so we went as soon as it opened at 10am.

'But after about 10 minutes, the lifeguard came up to me and asked if they were all my children.

'He said he was going to have to ask us to leave as their policy is to only have two children to one adult.

'I was really upset and so were the children - I practically had to pull them out of there kicking and screaming.'

Ms Noble, from Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, arranged the trip through the charity Family Fund, which supports disabled children.

And the family were dealt another blow when resort bosses told them they could not go on any fairground rides without extra supervision.

Ms Noble was offered the 'Red Riders' service, where Butlins workers accompany the children on rides - but this is only offered for two hours a day.

The devastated mother says she was then forced to pay £250 to keep the children entertained with other activities instead.

She said: 'It just seemed like the last straw and I ended up crying on the phone to my mum.

'I spent £250 on keeping the children entertained in arcades - my mum had to transfer money over.

'The kids were irritable and didn't have a good time. It ruined our holiday.

'I understand the health and safety thing, but why did they let me book a holiday in the first place without any other adults? I wish I'd known sooner.'

A spokesman for Butlins said: 'When guests book with us, our phone advisors make them aware of our policies regarding child supervision in our pools and fairgrounds.

'The same information is on our website.

'Our policy in our pools, which would mirror those of other public pools, is that every two children aged eight years old and under must be accompanied by at least one adult.

'The team felt that the older child with autism could not be provided with a realistic level of supervision. 

'The safety of all our guests is our priority.'
