A toddler has died in a tragic accident after she was accidentally knocked down  by a car apparently driven by her father.

The 15-month-old girl, who has not been named, suffered fatal injuries in the  incident outside her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on Saturday evening.

Despite desperate attempts by neighbours and paramedics to save her, she was  confirmed dead a short time after arriving at hospital.

A spokesman said the driver of the car, understood to be the girl's father, has been spoken to by officers, but officers say initial  investigations suggest he was not at fault.

Sergeant Carl Quinn, of West Yorkshire Police's Major Collision Enquiry Team,  said: 'We are conducting a full investigation to establish the circumstances  surrounding this child's death although early indications are that this appears  to have been a tragic accident.

'We are working closely with the child's family to support them at what will  clearly be a very difficult time for them.'

After a neighbour, aided by a 999 operator, performed CPR the girl was taken to Leeds General Infirmary but was pronounced dead a short time later

The incident happened in a quiet cul-de-sac at about 7.30pm on Saturday, when  the girl was struck by a black Toyota Avensis.

A neighbour administered CPR, with help from a 999 call-handler, until  paramedics arrived. The girl was taken to Leeds General Infirmary but was pronounced dead a short  time later.

The toddler's inquest is expected to open in the next few days. Sergeant Quinn added: 'We would appeal for anyone who witnessed the incident  itself to contact us.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Major Collision Enquiry Team on  01924 293047.
