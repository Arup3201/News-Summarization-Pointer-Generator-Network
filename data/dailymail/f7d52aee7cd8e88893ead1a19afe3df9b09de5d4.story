A Montana man who painstakingly gathered and reassembled parts of five $100 bills eaten by his golden retriever has been reimbursed by the U.S. Treasury for the 'mutt-ilated' currency.

Wayne Klinkel of Helena, Montana received a $500 check earlier this week.

His 12-year-old dog, Sundance, downed all but half of one of the bills in December.

Taste for money: Sundance, the golden retriever known for eating five $100 bills, rejects the taste of this check his owner Wayne Klinkel received after painstakingly reassembling parts of five $100 bills eaten by the dog last year

Sundance snacked on the cash in the family vehicle while Klinkel and his wife ate at a restaurant.

They were on a road trip to visit their daughter in Colorado.

However, when they returned to the car the money - aside from the dollar bill - was gone.

'I thought 'You dumb SOB,'' Klinkel told the Helena Independent Record. 'I couldn't believe he did that.'

Klinkel says he carefully picked through the dog's droppings to recover parts of the bills and his daughter recovered more when the snow melted armed with rubber gloves for the rest of the vacation.

Expensive tastes: Sundance managed to scoff five $100 bills when his owner Wayne Klinkel left him in his car - leaving a $1 note which was amidst the cash

Knowing that paper doesn't digest, he managed to pick portions of the gobbled notes out of the dog's poop.

'I
 pretty much recovered two fairly complete bills, and had some other 
pieces,' Klinkel said. 'But it wasn't nearly enough there to do anything
 with it.'

His 
daughter's husband later found more pieces of the $100 bills and Church 
brought them to her parent's home next time she visited.

After letting the money soak in dish soap for a week, Klinkel drained and rinsed the pieces and let them dry.

Refund? This is one of the five pieced together notes Klinkel sent to the treasury, wrapped in plastic bags and retrieved from Sundance's bathroom visits

He
 then pieced the bills back together like a puzzle, taped them up and 
put each note in its own plastic bag, according to the Record.

He
 took the recovered notes to a local bank where tellers laughed heartily
 at his ordeal then suggested he send the mutilated currency to the 
Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing, with a letter 
explaining how the money came to be destroyed.

The notes were then sent to the U.S. Treasury in April of this year with an explanation.

'Sundance is notorious for eating anything and everything, so right away I knew what happened.'

Klinkel followed the pet around armed with rubber gloves for the rest of the family vacation.

'I
 pretty much recovered two fairly complete bills, and had some other 
pieces,' Klinkel said. 'But it wasn't nearly enough there to do anything
 with it.'

His daughter's husband later found more pieces.

Vacation work: Klinkel closely guarded his pet's poop while on vacation so he could piece together the bits of bills that remained

After letting the money soak in dish soap for a week, Klinkel drained and rinsed the pieces and let them dry.

He took the recovered notes to a local bank where tellers laughed heartily at his ordeal then suggested he send the mutilated currency to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Engraving and Printing, with a letter explaining how the money came to be destroyed.

He got a receipt for the bills 10 days later, and didn’t hear from the Treasury until he received the check earlier this week.

'I gave Sundance a pat, showed it to him and told him not to eat it,' said Klinkel.

He said there wasn’t any correspondence with the check, but the memo section in the bottom left read: 'MUT.CURR REFUND.'

He said that he wasn't angry with his beloved pet.

'Sundance may have eaten my money, but what he took he gives back in unconditional love,' Klinkel said.
