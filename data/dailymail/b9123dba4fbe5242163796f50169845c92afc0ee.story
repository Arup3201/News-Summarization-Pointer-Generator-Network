A new study suggests Paris is losing its reputation as the City of Love and New York can no longer lay claim to the title of the city that never sleeps.

The survey of 2,000 tourists debunks several city break myths and suggests that some cities aren’t living up to their celebrated nicknames.

In the eyes of some travellers, Paris has been usurped by The Eternal City as the world’s most romantic destination.

New City of Love? Twenty-eight per cent of respondents named Rome as the most romantic destination

Second spot went to Venice, which recently hosted the wedding of George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin

Of those polled, 28 per cent ranked Rome at the top of their list of love spots, followed by Venice (21 per cent), which recently played host to the wedding of actor George Clooney and British human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin.

Paris was relegated to fifth spot on the list with just nine per cent of respondents considering it the top city for a romantic getaway.

Prague came in third (16 per cent) while Bruges ranked fourth (11 per cent), according to the survey commissioned by holiday price comparison website Icelolly.

Florence, which played host to Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's wedding bash in May did not make the top ten.

Best nightlife? Berlin beat Ibiza and Las Vegas as the best party destination

When it comes to raucous nightlife, two of the usual suspects – Ibiza and Las Vegas – failed to crack the top five.

Nearly a quarter of those polled (23 per cent) listed Berlin as the real Sin City, followed by Istanbul (18 per cent), Miami (14 per cent), Brussels (11 per cent) and Amsterdam (ten per cent).

Ibiza (eight per cent) and Las Vegas (five per cent) finished seventh and eighth, respectively.

All night long: Holidaymakers named Tokyo as the true city that never sleeps - not New York

New York claims to be the city that never sleeps but it ranked fifth on a list of the top sleepless cities

And it turns out Tokyo is the metropolis that holidaymakers consider to be the true city that never sleeps – not New York.

Thirty-one per cent of respondents put Tokyo at the top of their list of sleepless cities, with New York ranking fifth behind Mexico City, Barcelona and Moscow.

Suniel Makh, brand director at Icelolly, said: ‘Certain facts that we used to take for granted are now being seriously contested, such as where to go for the most romantic time or craziest parties.

‘Some couples have grown tired of the Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysees, it feels like déjà vu and they’re looking for new and exciting alternatives instead.’
