Ian Poulter missed a short putt at the last as he fell short in his bid to win a first title in two years at the Turkish Airlines Open.

The 38-year-old had a 6ft putt to force a play-off with America’s Brooks Koepka, but pulled it left of the target.

While Poulter will be forced to reflect on a third-round 75 that wrecked a good week, Rory McIlroy now only needs to turn up at the season’s finale next week to claim the Race to Dubai.

There was an outside chance of the absent Northern Irishman being usurped at the top of the Order of Merit, but the failure of Marcel Siem, Jamie Donaldson or Sergio Garcia to win here means McIlroy’s second Race title in three years is mathematically assured.

None of which will be a consolation to Poulter, his Ryder Cup team-mate.

Poulter got off to a blistering start to the tournament and opened a six-shot lead with rounds of 64 and 66 at the end of a poor season.

But he was brutal in assessment of a ‘c**p’ third round and could not quite match Koepka’s fast finish, despite shooting a 67.

Koepka had appeared to wobble in the finish two holes, first with an iron into deep rough next to the 17th green and then by driving into trees at the last. But each time he recovered for par and a seven-under round of 65, meaning Poulter needed to birdie the par five 18th to force a play-off.

Siem went into the final round as McIlroy's only realistic challenger in the Race to Dubai but after finishing on 12 under revealed he dislocated a rib while stretching before his final-round 71.

Rory McIlroy, holding the 2014 Player of the trophy, has sealed a second Race to Dubai win

McIlroy's 'best ever year' include victories at The Open (above), US PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup

He said: 'I went in the gym this morning at 7am and warmed up, and then we did a bit of stretching - something I haven't done for a year now because of my surgeries. I couldn't really do it, and dislocated my rib. I thought I can't even tee it up.

'Then my physio tried to crack it back in, didn't work and we went so see the chiropractor and they pushed it back in. I had like 1,600 milligrams of Ibuprofen. I couldn't have a proper back swing.'

McIlroy, who won two majors in 2014, said: 'This has obviously been the best season of my career by a long way, and to win The Race to Dubai for the second time really is something truly special. That four-week spell over the summer, from The Open to the US PGA Championship, would have to be the best golf of my life, so I feel like I’ve really earned The Race to Dubai.

'Winning it for the first time two years ago was a fantastic feeling, but I feel like I’m now a more complete player and my all-round game has moved to another level. I’ve put in a lot of hard work this season, with my game and my fitness, so it’s nice to get the rewards at the end of it.

Marcel Siem's chance of challenging McIlroy in the Race to Dubai was effectively ended by a dislocated rib

Poulter heads to Dubai without any pressure and hoping to end his season on a high

'In some ways the pressure is off next week, but I’ll fight very hard to end the year on a high with another victory. I’ve a great record in this tournament, and in Dubai generally, having secured my first European Tour win there in 2009.'

Poulter said: 'It's a disappointing outcome. I think hats off to a great final round, and obviously he (Koepka) has played some superb golf there. The damage was done on Saturday. That, for me, is really disappointing; to have played three great rounds of golf, and just one blip on Saturday, is a real shame.

'So you know, it's frustrating. It is what it is. There's no other word for it. Yes, I'm going to be angry. I'll be angry for a good few days. But that's fine. I'll keep myself in my own little room and have a little chat with myself and come out and win next week.'
