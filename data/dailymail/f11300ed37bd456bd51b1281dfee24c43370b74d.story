Almost one in three households in some areas of the country have not one person in work, shocking figures revealed today.

And in a reflection of the stagnant and fragile state of the economy the three areas with the highest rates of of joblessness are the same cities that topped the table last year.

More than 30 per cent of households in Liverpool, Nottingham and Glasgow are classed as workless in 2010, said the Office for National Statistics.

For Liverpool and Glasgow the figure fell in the previous year from 32.1 per cent and 31.1 per cent, to 31.9 per cent and 30.7 per cent.

Jobless Britain: Liverpool, Glasgow and Nottingham have recorded the highest level of 
households where no-one is in work for the second year in a row

In Nottingham it increased from 31.3 per cent to 31.6 per cent.

Liverpool has had the highest number of workless households in five of the past seven years, today's data showed.

There were 3.9million workless households in the UK last year - a total of 5.4million people aged between 16 and 64.

The ONS said being sick or disabled was the main reason for people nationally not being in work.

Around a third of those not working in Liverpool and Glasgow gave this reason, the same as the national figure of 28 per cent.

• Sick or disabled (28 per cent)

• Unemployed (19 per cent)

• Retired (19 per cent)

• Looking after the family or home (16 per cent)

• Study (12 per cent)

• Other (7 per cent)

However, 43 per cent of people in workless households in Nottingham gave study as their main reason, compared with 12 per cent nationally.

Some people in workless households are 
not working because of early retirement. This figure was much higher in 
the South West but low in London.

The areas with the lowest number of households without work were Oxfordshire, Surrey, Aberdeen, and NE Moray, all around 11 per cent.

The national average for workless households is currently 18.9 per cent according to the latest figures.

A total of 1.84million children lived in the so-called workless households figures in June showed.

Earlier this month new figures revealed more than a quarter of graduates do not have a full-time job three and a half years after leaving university.

A staggering 115,000 youngsters who 
graduated in 2007 have been consigned to the unemployment scrapheap, 
lumbered with a dead-end part-time job or are still in education, 
according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).

There were 3.9million workless households in the UK last year - a total of 5.4million people aged between 16 and 64.

1. Liverpool (31.9 per cent)

2. Nottingham (31.6 per cent)

3. Glasgow (30.7 per cent)

4. Wolverhampton (28.1 per cent)

5. Manchester (26.9 per cent)

Despite today's figures, the overall number of workless households has fallen slightly in the past year.

Employment minister Chris Grayling said in June: 'While the slight fall in the numbers of workless households and children living in workless households is encouraging, these figures still underline the sheer scale of the challenge we face.

'Over the last decade thousands of people were simply abandoned to a lifetime on benefits, and a staggering 1.84million children are living in homes where currently no one works.

'This is why we launched the Work Programme this summer which will give tailor-made support to help people get off benefits and get into work, while our overhaul of the benefits system will ensure that work is always the best option.'
