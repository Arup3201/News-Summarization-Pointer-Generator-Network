Huntsmen, horses and hounds paraded through towns and villages across the country this morning as the traditional Boxing Day hunt got underway.

They were joined by huge crowds - both mounted and on foot - who were keen to show their backing for the annual event. Roughly a quarter of a million people were expected to attend the 300 hunts held today.

It comes after it emerged yesterday that hunt supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election.

Thousands of supporters were expected to ride out today in defiance of the ban, which was pushed through reluctantly by Tony Blair as a piece of 'red meat' to keep his backbenchers on side.

In Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, which lies in David Cameron's Witney constituency, riders of the Heythrop Hunt were greeted by hundreds of excited supporters in the town square.  Among the crowd were horse trainer Charlie Brooks, husband of former News International chief executive Rebekah. 

The Hunt, which has hunted four days a week since 1835, rode through land belonging to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, just outside the village of Chadlington, Oxfordhsire.

The presenter was seen standing and watching the hunt from the farm, which is just a few miles away from his family home. 

Around 50 huntsmen braved the cold to gather for the Zetland Hunt in North Yorkshire. Hundreds of people lined the streets of the village of Alborough St John, to see the horses and hounds as they set off on the trail around the surrounding farmland.  

Elsewhere, in Ledbury, Herefordshire, the Ledbury Hunt welcomed some 150 mounted followers and 5,000 well-wishers as they set off on their annual meet. David Redvers, joint-master of the  hunt, said there was 'absolute commitment' to keeping the hunt going.

He said: 'We have always had tremendous support from local people – our Boxing Day meet is a traditional and very popular part of the life of Ledbury.

'There is absolute commitment to keep the Ledbury going until repeal and support from young and old has never waned, indeed it may have increased. We are very fortunate.'

The hunts took place a day after it was revealed that pro-hunting supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the 2004 Hunting Act after the next election. 

A Conservative pledge to hold a free vote in the Commons on scrapping the decade-old ban was quietly shelved after ministers realised it would be lost.

But campaigners claim the result will be very different if Scottish MPs, dominated by Labour, are barred from voting on the issue after next year's election.

A well-placed source in the pro-hunting campaign said: 'Hunting is a classic example of the anomaly which allows Scottish MPs to dictate the law in England and Wales on an issue over which they themselves have no say in Scotland because it is a matter that has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

'Any move to stop MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from voting on devolved issues in the next parliament would, therefore, make repeal or amendment of the Hunting Act in England and Wales much more likely.'

A strong showing by the SNP – whose MPs do not vote on English-only matters on principle – could have a similar effect.

Research by the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance suggests that English and Welsh MPs would vote by a majority of 22 to scrap the ban if a vote were held now.

The research, based on MPs' public and private indications, suggests that 292 MPs in England and Wales are in favour of repealing the law, with only 270 against.

But the slim majority south of the border is heavily outweighed by overwhelming support for the ban among MPs in Scotland, where hunting was banned separately by the Scottish Parliament.

The Countryside Alliance believes that Scottish MPs would vote to keep the ban by 47 votes to six. Northern Ireland's MPs are said to support repeal of the ban by eight votes to five.

The hunts took place a day after it was revealed that pro-hunting supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the 2004 Hunting Act after the next election

The figures suggest that if Scottish MPs were allowed to vote then a bid to repeal the ban would fail by a majority of 16.

But, following cross-party agreement that Scotland should be handed sweeping new powers, party leaders are now under intense pressure to bar Scottish MPs from voting on purely English matters at Westminster.

Labour's 2004 Hunting Act does not apply in Scotland, where hunting was banned two years earlier.

A Countryside Alliance spokesman said: 'The promised vote on repeal has not materialised in this Parliament, largely because of uncertainty about the outcome, with 41 Scottish Labour MPs effectively vetoing any change in the law in England and Wales. Scotland has its own hunting legislation and there can be no justification for continuing to allow Scottish Labour MPs to perpetuate the prejudice of the Hunting Act.'

The Tories are expected to repeat their pledge to hold a free vote on hunting if they win the election.

But anti-hunting groups are stepping up pressure on Labour to tighten the law, amid concern at the low level of prosecutions.
