A puppy-owner who mistreated her pet so badly it went bald and then pretended it was a stray to avoid paying vets’ fees has been banned from keeping animals for ten years.

Wendy Bowley, 44, wrapped six-month-old pooch Rory in a blood-stained sheet and told vets she had just rescued him.

The border terrier, named Rory, was so ill with mange - a skin condition caused by a parasitic mite - he lost virtually all his fur and was bleeding from numerous open sores.

Cruel: Wendy Bowley, of Redhill, Hereford, subjected her puppy to appalling abuse, then tried to pretend he was a stray so she would not have to pay the vet's bill, the court heard

A court heard the puppy, who was 
struggling to open his eyes and was barely able to stand, had been 
suffering from the painful condition for at least three months - half 
his young life.

Yesterday, Bowley from Redhill, Hereford, was banned from keeping pets for a decade.

She was also sentenced to six-month community order and ordered to pay costs of £175.

Bowley had pleaded guilty to causing 
unnecessary suffering to an animal by failing to seek treatment and 
mistreating a dog at Hereford Magistrates Court in July.

Shocking pictures released of the puppy show the terrible state he was in before Bowley finally sought veterinary treatment.

But rather than pay, Bowley pretended 
she was a Good Samaritan in order to avoid the £600 bill, the court 
heard at an earlier hearing.

Prosecuting, Nick Sutton said Bowley 
took Rory to a surgery on March 15 despite owning the practice money 
dating back nine years.

She was advised to seek help from an animal charity that offers to pay for treatment when owners are struggling but did not.

Bowley then took the sick pooch to 
Laurels Veterinary Surgery in Hereford 11 days later, where she again 
claimed he was a stray she had found in the garden.

Chris Reed, defending, said Bowley was 'in an incredibly difficult position' because she simply could not afford the bill.

He said: 'It’s not the case that Mrs Bowley ignored the situation.

'Clearly the dog was suffering, but 
Wendy Bowley wasn’t simply being cruel. She tried her best to deal with a
situation to the best of her ability.'

The court also heard that Bowley had since signed the dog over to the RSPCA and he has now been re-homed.

Speaking after the case, RSPCA 
Inspector Pippa Boyd said: 'There is no excuse to allow a dog to be in 
that condition for such an extended period.

'I am pleased to say the dog is now back to a happy and health condition and has been re-homed.'
