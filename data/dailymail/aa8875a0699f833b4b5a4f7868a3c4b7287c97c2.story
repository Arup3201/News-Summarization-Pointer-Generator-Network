A 19-year-old student pledging to the Zeta Mu Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi at California University State Northridge (CSUN) was killed by hazing, the school confirmed today after an internal investigation of the July incident.

Armando Villa, 19, was found blistered and barefoot in a ditch after running out 
of water while being forced to complete an 18-mile hike through the Angeles Forest while 'blindfolded and without shoes or his cell-phone.' Other pledges were able to track down a park ranger for help but Villa was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

CSUN President Dianne Harrison read a report of the school's findings on Friday and announced that the fraternity has permanently withdrawn from the institution. A separate police investigation will probe individual student culpability for Villa's death.

'The report’s findings are deeply disturbing, and I will not turn a blind eye to any reports of hazing. Hazing is stupid, senseless, dangerous and against the law in California.

'It is a vestige of a toxic way of thinking in which it was somehow okay to degrade, humiliate and potentially harm others. It has no place on this or any university campus, in any student club or organization, and it will not be tolerated,' said Harrison in a statement.

Harrison also said that the hike was planned without safety precautions. The pledges didn't have enough water and were blindfolded and were stripped of their cell phones and their shoes, reports NBC.

Villa's family are asking students who were present during the hike to come forward with more information about the moments leading up to their son's death.

'There’s just a lot of things that don’t add up and what they’re telling us, it’s not enough. They know a lot more than they’re telling us,' says Jose Serrato, Villa’s stepfather, told reporters at NBC.

In a separate statement, Villa's parents called hazing a 'barbaric ritual.'

Initiation: Villa's family say he and other young men hoping to join the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity were left on a mountain with very little water and no shoes to find their way back overnight

'Hazing is an awful practice. It cost our son his life,' they said.

'No one else should suffer because of this barbaric ritual that endangers and ridicules others just for the enjoyment of immature young men.'

Villa's mother and stepfather told reporters that they found a message in their son's phone following his death about his desire to stop hazing.

'Some people know what happened out there on the trail. They talk about a fraternity being a brotherhood based on honor, but neither the local chapter, the national parent organization of Pi Kappa Phi, nor any of Armando’s so-called brothers have done the honorable thing by telling us what happened to our son,' Villa’s parents said.

'It is shameful behaviour and we hope and pray that no other parent ever has to go through what we have suffered through.'

Investigation: Villa (left) was found with no shoes and blisters to his feet and back and police are investigating to determine student culpability for his death

The national and local chapters of Phi Kappa voted yesterday to withdraw from the university permanently, reports the LA Times.

The fraternity had already been suspended.

The Los Angeles County Sherif’s Department is conducting an investigation but their findings have not yet been released

NBC reports that the college set new guidelines for hazing on August 19 including conditions that fraternities must submit recruitment procedures to the school before proceeding with them.

In a statement issued back in July following Villa's death, Mark Timmes, chief executive of the national Pi Kappa Phi, said hazing 'has no place in our fraternity.'

'Should the student chapter or individual members be found in violation of Pi Kappa Phi’s standards of conduct through our discipline process, they will be held accountable by the national fraternity,' he said.

Now being questioned is whether or not criminal charges will be filed against members of the fraternity if they are found responsible.

The LA Times reports that hazing is a crime in California ever since the 2006 death of a Cal State Chico students who was forced to drink too much water and suffer at the hands of fraternity tormentors.
