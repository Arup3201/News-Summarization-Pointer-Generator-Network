A senior Conservative MP has helped fund a female lawyer who is suing a top City firm for £22 million after it fired her for writing a ‘bonkbuster’ novel based on her hedonistic lifestyle.

Deidre Clark, who was sacked from her £130,000-a-year job after publishing the thinly veiled account of her escapades in Allen & Overy’s Moscow office, has been bankrolled by Tory MP David Mowat – who has also being asked to testify on her behalf as a character witness.

Mr Mowat, a Commons aide to Treasury Minister Greg Clark, gave nearly £2,000 to Ms Clark to help her with the cost of leaving Russia after she was sacked for writing the book.

Allen & Overy – part of the ‘magic circle’ of top UK law firms – dismissed Ms Clark, 47, four years ago for ‘bringing the company into disrepute’ by publishing Expat, an explicit online account of champagne parties and sexual exploits among Westerners in Moscow.

The romp, written under the name Deidre Dare and soon dubbed ‘Sexpat’, told the story of ‘Dasha’ as she snorted cocaine, compared the sexual performances of numerous men and turned up to work with crippling hangovers after nights spent in strip clubs.

Ms Clark has countered by bringing an action against the company in New York for sexual harassment, discrimination and breach of contract, demanding damages of £22 million as compensation for  ‘20 lost years’ of future work.

Mr Mowat, 55, MP for Warrington South, first met US citizen Ms Clark a decade ago when she was staying in London for a year as part of a round-the-world trip. 

Last night, Ms Clark said: ‘I am delighted to have such an eminent person backing me.’ Mr Mowat, a former partner with managing consultant Accenture, said: ‘I was quite matey with Ms Clark and her partner Mike, so I lent her some money to help her out. I hope she wins the case.’

He said he had been asked to act as a character witness in her legal action, but ‘in the circumstances’ had decided against doing so.

A spokesman for Allen & Overy declined to comment.
