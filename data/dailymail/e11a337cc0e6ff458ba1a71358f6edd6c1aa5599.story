Robert Mugabe has announced that he will stand again for President of Zimbabwe - in order to rescue the country he has driven to near ruin.

The frail leader, who has been in power for 31 years, claimed that as the country is in such as mess it would be 'an act of cowardice' for him to step down from power.

Addressing supporters, the 87-year-old said: 'Luckily, God has given me this longer life than others to be with you and I will not let you down.'

Mugabe, who reportedly has prostate cancer, confirmed that he will stand as his Zanu PF party’s sole candidate in Presidential elections planned for sometime 'early next year.' 

Under Mr Mugabe’s rule, Zimbabwe has gone from being the breadbasket of Africa to one of the continent’s - and the world’s - poorest countries.

Three-quarters of the population live on less than £1 a day and over half of the work force is unemployed.

However, rather than acknowledge his own 
role in the economic collapse, Mugabe this weekend blamed the West, 
which has imposed economic sanctions in protest at his increasingly 
autocratic rule.

As such, Mugabe argued that he needs to stay in power, saying: 'I can’t leave you in such a mess.

'It would be completely wrong and a loss of confidence in myself.  When the party is moving ahead, then I’ll say it is in your own hands.'

Mugabe was speaking on Saturday evening on the final day of his party’s annual conference in the country’s second city of Bulawayo. 

He saved his bitterest comments for his 
political rival Morgan Tsvangirai, with whom he has shared power since 
the disputed and violent elections of 2008.

Mugabe claimed that Tsvangirai, now the country’s Prime Minister, has taken 'a free ride' and labelled the power sharing deal a 'monster' that should be 'buried.' 

'Let us now start preparing for elections and as we do that we are digging the grave of this monster', he said.

'Are you ready to dig this grave? Have you got your picks and shovels ready?'  he asked his followers.

Robert Mugabe, 87, has ruled Zimbabwe ever since it independence from Britain in 1980.
