Billionaire heiress Petra Ecclestone is being sued over allegedly owing $107,000 of unpaid electricity bills.

The daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone bought the sprawling mansion in Beverly Hills in 2011 which cost a reported $85million.

The house was built in Holmby Hills in 1991 by Aaron and Candy Spelling.

However, Petra has been accused of not keeping up with her electricity bills.

According to TMZ, the billionaire heiress has allegedly been hit with a lawsuit from Sun Electric which says it installed kitchen, lighting and security cameras. 

Sun Electric says it has been paid some of the amount but that Stunt still owes more than $107K.

However, Mark Gregaros, of Gregaros & Gregaros which represents the couple, said: 'Not only is there no basis to this lawsuit, there is no contract with this company.

'There is absolutely no merit to this 
lawsuit and we have been instructed to counter sue this company. We will
 commence this action immediately.'

Petra is the youngest child of Bernie Ecclestone and gave birth to her daughter Lavinia in 2013.

Her home is a 123-room mansion and at the time of buying it was the most expensive property in the world.

Petra's husband James Stunt made his fortune in the Gaming and Trans Atlantic Shipping industry and Mining investments.

Last month the art dealer, described as a 'flash b****** by his father-in-law, was spotted visiting his Savile Row tailor, Huntsman, which has made clothes for the gentry for 200 years. 

Stunt pulled up in a Lamborghini at the tailor where suits start at £3,500. 

He was accompanied by two Rolls-Royce Celestials and two Range Rovers. 

All five cars had blacked-out windows and personalised number plates.
