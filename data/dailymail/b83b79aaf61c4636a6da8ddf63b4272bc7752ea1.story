At Chipotle, guacamole costs extra - but it soon may not be available at all thanks to climate change.

The Denver, Colorado-based chain of Mexican fast-food restaurants threatened to take the condiment off the menu because of the rising price of avocados.

While the avocado crop is currently fine, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are predicting drier temperatures will lead to a 40 per cent drop in California's avocado crop over the next 32 years. Most modern scientists agree that there is a direct correlation between the increase of droughts and global warming, according to Think Progress.

Sad news for lunch: Mexican fast-food chain Chipotle is threatening to take guacamole off the menu due to the rising price of avocados

'Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including any changes associated with global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients,' the chain wrote in their annual report released last month.

'In the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items, such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas, rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients.'

Any increase in avocado prices impacts Chipotle, which uses an estimated 97,000 pounds of the fruit a day to make guacamole - adding up to 35.4million pounds of avocados a year. 

Chipotle has made a promise to its 
customers to source ingredients from organic, local and sustainable 
sources, which means the cost of their ingredients are already more 
expensive than other chains. 

Even
 if the avocado crop is somehow unaffected, there's always rising prices
 of the chain's other ingredients - such as beef - which could nudge the
 already-pricy guacamole off the menu.

However,
 the chain has made clear that they don't want to take guacamole off the
 menu and that doing so would hurt their business.

'Any such changes to our available
 menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and comparable 
restaurant sales, and could also have an adverse impact on our brand,' 
the report read.

For now, the forecasted guacamole apocalypse may only affect Chipotle restaurants in California.

Drought
 conditions are already hurting produce production in the region, and 
Chipotle sources its food from farms within 350 miles of where it will 
be served.
