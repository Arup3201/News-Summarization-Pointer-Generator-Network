No inquest will be held into the death of Michael Payne, father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne, because he died of natural causes, a coroner ruled

The father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne died of natural causes and no inquest will be held into his death, a coroner ruled. 

Michael Payne had spent more than 10 years struggling with the death of his daughter who was abducted and killed by serial sex offender Roy Whiting in 2000. 

Mr Payne was found dead at his home in Maidstone in Kent in October in non-suspicious circumstances according to police. 

The father of four had struggled with an alcohol problem as he attempted to come to terms with the death of eight-year-old Sarah and also split from his wife of 18 years, Sara, in 2003.

The office for Patricia Harding, coroner for Mid Kent and Medway, has confirmed that he died from natural causes and an inquest will not be held.

Friends said the 45-year-old had spent years 'battling his demons' in the aftermath of his daughter's disappearance and murder. 

His brother Alan, 47, said 'he was in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah'

After his death Mr Payne's daughter Charlotte wrote a message saying she was 'heartbroken'.

She said: 'No matter what happened and how many mistakes we all made. You will always be my daddy. .

Her brother Lee wrote: 'Dad, you had your demons and troubles but you had a good heart and was a decent man!'

Mr Payne was found dead at his home after his family contacted police because they had been unable to get hold of him.  

After his death his father Terrance said: 'After the incident we all went downhill a bit, but we managed to pull ourselves together whereas Michael really struggled. We all knew Mike had demons but it's sad it has come to this.'

The former airport worker previously said he had felt guilty he had been unable to protect his daughter at this had put a strain on his marriage and eventually led to their divorce. 

At the time his former wife told the then News of the World: We know we're not the same people we once were - and everyone knows the awful reason why.'

Mr Payne had served time in prison after he admitted glassing his brother Stephen in three years ago after a heavy drinking session.

Sarah's mother, 45, went on to campaign for a change in legislation to allow parents to know if convicted child sex offenders live nearby, known as Sarah's Law.

She has been awarded an MBE and an honorary doctorate for her work. 

But she suffered a stroke in 2009 which has left her walking with the assistance of a stick.

Sarah, of Hersham, Surrey, disappeared on the evening of July 1 2000 from a cornfield near the home of her paternal grandparents, Terence and Lesley Payne.

She had been playing with her older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte, before she was snatched. 

Charlotte Payne posted a heartfelt tribute to her father on Facebook after his death in October this year

Sara and Michael Payne were pictured at their Surrey home in 2002 after their daughter's killer was jailed 

Her body was found on July 17 in a field near Pulborough, some 15 miles from Kingston Gorse where she had disappeared.

A high profile investigation which used sophisticated forensic evidence led to the conviction of Whiting for the murder in 2001 after a blonde hair was found in his van. Whiting, who had previously been in prison for assaulting a young girl, had moved to Sussex before Sarah was abducted.

He was sentenced to life in prison and his minimum term was released from 50 years to 40 in 2010. 

This will mean Whiting, who is now 55, will be in his eighties if he is released.

At the time Mr Payne criticised the decision as 'outrageous.'  

Roy Whiting was convicted of Sarah's murder 

In December 2001, Roy Whiting was sentenced to life in prison with a recommendation that he never be released after a jury found him guilty of the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne.

After he was convicted, the court heard he had a previous conviction for the kidnap and indecent assault of a nine-year-old girl.

The jury, who had been unaware of the previous sex conviction, were told Whiting had been sentenced to four years in jail for the sex attack in June 1995.

Revelations Whiting already had a history of child abuse prior to the killing of Sarah prompted a national debate about how paedophiles are dealt with in the justice system.

Mr and Mrs Payne began actively campaigning for a law change, piling pressure on ministers to allow people to know about convicted paedophiles living in their area.

In the wake of Whiting's sentencing, Mrs Payne said: 'The Government only can make this decision. Right now, we have got a lot of work to do and it doesn't stop here. It just begins. You know what change I want, Sarah's Law.'

The rule, eventually introduced in 2011, allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending.

The scheme is a watered-down version of similar laws in the U.S. under which details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised.

In 2008, Mrs Payne was awarded an MBE for her tireless campaigning on the issue.
