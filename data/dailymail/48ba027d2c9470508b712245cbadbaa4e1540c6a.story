Three courts have now denied the efforts of an animal rights group that was pushing for chimpanzees to be granted the same rights as human beings.

The Nonhuman Rights Project filed three different lawsuits in an effort to get four chimps- Tommy, Kiko, Hercules and Leo- the legal rights ‘to bodily liberty’ but the courts rejected their arguments.

Tommy, the 26-year-old ape, is owned by Pat Levery in Gloversville, New York, and in spite of the animal rights’ group claims that the animal is confined in a ‘prison’, Mr Levery said that the cage where Tommy lives in is completely adequate.

‘I’d be happy to show you Tommy’s home, to show you how well he is cared for,’ Mr Levery told CNN after the ruling against the lawsuit was announced.

Remaining with their owners: Three lawsuits in New York have kept chimpanzees (similar to those above) in the care of their owners even though an animal rights group wanted to have them placed in a sanctuary

The group sought to have a court-backed order handed out that would free the four chimps from their caged confines, allowing them to live the rest of their lives in a primate sanctuary.

'In this case, we are claiming that chimpanzees are autonomous,' the group’s founder Massachusetts lawyer Steven Wise said.

'That is, being able to self-determine, be self-aware, and be able to choose how to live their own lives.'

Even before the rejected verdicts were handed down, Wise said he didn’t expect the decisions to be favorable because the judges have no legal precedent to rely on.

He added: 'We'll take it to the Appellate Division and then the state Court of Appeals. We've been preparing for lawsuits for many years. These are the first in a long series of suits that will chip away at the legal thinghood of such non-human animals as chimpanzees.'

The national group says it is dedicated to changing the common law status of some species other than humans. The group's board of directors includes Wise and chimpanzee research pioneer Jane Goodall.

The lawsuits include affidavits from scientists who say chimpanzees have complex cognitive abilities, such as awareness of the past and the ability to make choices, and display complex emotions such as empathy.

'Once we prove that chimpanzees are autonomous, that should be sufficient for them to gain legal personhood and at least have their fundamental interests protected by human rights,' Wise said.

Against his will: A nonhuman rights group sued a couple in New York for illegally detaining their chimpanzee named Tommy (who is not pictured above) in a cage on their trailer park and lost the case

If the lawsuits had succeeded, similar ones were planned on behalf of other species considered autonomous, such as gorillas, orangutans, whales, dolphins and elephants.

Tommy’s lawsuit was filed in the state Supreme Court in Fulton County, while a different one was filed in Niagara Falls on behalf of Kiko who currently lives in a cage in a brick building.

Kiko’s owners Carmen and Christie Presti have said they plan to move Kiko and other monkeys to a new facility on a large rural property.

The third lawsuit were filed on behalf of the remaining two chimpanzees who are used as part of locomotion research at Stony Brook University on Long Island.

All three have since been rejected.

David Favre, a professor of animal law at Michigan State University who's not part of the lawsuit, said chimpanzees ought to have recognition within the legal system.

He said animals typically are protected by anti-cruelty and animal welfare laws, but prosecutors often don't pursue animal cruelty complaints.

He called the lawsuits 'unprecedented' and said if they had succeeded, 'it would be the first time a court has been willing to step forward and examine the living conditions that a particular chimpanzee is in, and take jurisdiction over the chimpanzee and move it someplace more suitable to its needs.'
