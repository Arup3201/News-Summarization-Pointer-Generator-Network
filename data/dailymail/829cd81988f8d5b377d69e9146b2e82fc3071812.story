A breast cancer sufferer who has decided to devote the remainder of her life to making wedding dreams come true for others who, like her, are terminally ill, has released her autobiography on the day of her second wedding anniversary.

Naomi Thomas, 31, from Somerset, who suffers from secondary breast cancer, won the Daily Mail’s Inspirational Woman of the Year Award last November in recognition of the charity she set up, The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation.

She was then approached by Harper Collins to write an electronic book about her incredible life. No Ordinary Wedding Planner was published on Friday June 6, as she and husband Graham renewed their vows.

So in love: Naomi, left, and her husband Graham, right, renewed their wedding vows, two years after getting married, on their second anniversary last Friday. Naomi has terminal cancer and says she, 'doesn't know how much time I have left'

The couple went to the Deer Park Hotel in Devon for the intimate occasion, with 
only their three-year-old son Devon, a celebrant, photographer and vigil
 present.

It was exactly two years after they married at St Audries Park, Somerset, where they renewed their vows last year.

‘I don’t know how long I am going to be here, so we always renew our vows on our anniversary,’ Naomi tells MailOnline.

‘Graham
 and I always write our own vows, we update them every year and say what
 we’re thankful for and how we feel about each other.

‘Devon walked me down the aisle this time carrying balloons and at the end we lit candles together.’

Naomi was 26 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Graham had proposed just two days earlier.

Stronger than ever: Graham proposed to Naomi in 2009 just two days before she found out she had secondary breast cancer. The couple are pictured here renewing their vows last Friday

Happy anniversary! Happy couple Graham and Naomi, pictured here, have been married since 2012 and each year renew their vows. Naomi says she wants to make the most of her short life, as she suffers from incurable breast cancer

After
 seven months of treatment Naomi was declared free of cancer, only to be 
told just a few months later that the disease had returned and was incurable.

Devon was just six days old.

Thoughts
 of their wedding were the one thing that kept Naomi and Graham going, 
but the financial burden of terminal illness meant their big day was 
just a pipe dream.

However, dozens of donations from friends, family, local supporters and 
businesses – not to mention a £500 donation from a woman who wanted only
 to be known as Mary Poppins - allowed them to marry in Naomi’s dream setting on June 6 2012.

So
 inspired was Naomi by these well-wishers, that she ultimately set up 
her own charity with the mission of spreading the joy she had 
experienced on her big day.

My rock: Naomi set up The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation in 2012, with the help of husband Graham who is a trustee. The couple are pictured here on Friday, renewing their wedding vows

The
 Wedding Wishing Well Foundation was formed in December 2012. Since 
then, Naomi has helped bring together eight weddings and several additions to smaller weddings.

‘Because either the bride or groom is on limited time, we often have very little time ourselves,’ explains Naomi.

‘They may have found out about the illness halfway through planning the
 wedding, when they have little funds, time or energy left, 
so we’ll come in and sort out the cake or photographer, or organise to have
 the wedding take place by their hospital bed if need be. Whatever 
people need.'

Naomi continues: ‘The full weddings we’ve had about nine months to plan are worth £25,000 but we manage to do for £5,000-6,000.

‘It’s
 all from donations. Every single day I am overwhelmed and amazed by how
 incredibly supportive and generous people have been.’

On
 the back of the Daily Mail Inspirational Woman of the Year Award 2013, 
publishing house Harper Collins approached Naomi to write her story for them.

All smiles: 'Graham and I always write our own vows,' says Naomi, pictured right before renewing her wedding vows to Graham, pictured left, on Friday. The couple renew their vows every year

‘I’d always fancied writing a book but never had time,’ she says.

‘It
 was the phone call of a lifetime. Harper Collins wanted me to write an 
ebook as part of their new e-book series, HarperTrue.

‘They
 gave me advice on how to write it and it’s all my own words. I found 
once I started I couldn’t stop. They asked me for 18,000-20,000 words 
and my first draft was 38,000!

‘I requested that it be published on June 6, my wedding anniversary, when I knew I would renew my vows.’

'Graham is my rock,' says Naomi, pictured her with husband Graham on their second wedding anniversary on Friday. 'My marriage is stronger than it has ever been'

Now, with book deadline met and summer approaching, it's time for a break.

‘It’s
 pretty impossible for us to arrange weddings at short notice during 
summer anyway, because everything is booked up, plus I have a limit to 
how much I can do,’ says Naomi.

‘I can’t even stand 
up for very  long and get incredibly tired, so want to spend as much 
time making memories with Devon and Graham as I can,’ she says.

Naomi takes 30 tablets a day, has scans 
and check-ups every six months and regular injections to bring on early 
menopause, which prevents cancer-spreading oestrogen from developing.

‘I
 don’t know how long I have left,' she says. 'Despite all the medicine, cancer will 
do what it wants when it wants. I can’t plan further than six months 
ahead.’

While Naomi is open about her illness, she admits that writing the book was, ‘much harder than I thought.

‘We talk about cancer at home. Devon is four in September so even though he doesn’t fully understand, he knows mummy is ill.

‘But
 I feel that I discuss it so much, it’s numbed me slightly. Getting it 
all down in words was more difficult than I anticipated.

‘The hardest part was at the end, when I write all my thank yous.

‘I imagine that when I am gone, these are the words Graham will read over again – and Devon when he is old enough.

‘It’s very emotional.’

But
 for now, Naomi intends to live every day as if it were her last.

‘We are
 going to Egypt, the same place as we went on our honeymoon and I never 
thought we’d ever afford to go back,' she says.

'It was donated to us in the first 
place and now we’ve saved up to go again. I can’t wait to spend time with my boys. Devon is a little older now so hopefully will get more out of it.

‘It’s so important to stop and spend time as a family. Cancer is an awful thing but, actually, it’s brought us closer together.

‘My marriage is stronger than it’s ever been.’
