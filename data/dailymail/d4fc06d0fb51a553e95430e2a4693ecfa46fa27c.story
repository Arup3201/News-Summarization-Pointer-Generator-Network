They are the passionate love letters Mick Jagger wanted to keep under wraps.

Written in the summer of 1969 to his secret lover Marsha Hunt, they reveal a tender side to the Rolling Stones singer rarely seen in public.

Jagger is understood to have made it clear to his former girlfriend that he wished to keep them private – but she had other ideas.

Rolling Stones' hit Brown Sugar

Love letter: An envelope containing one of the letters, written by a 25-year-old Mick Jagger during his time in Australia and sent to Ms Hunt's London address, which sold for £187,250

Yesterday, they went under the hammer for an incredible £187,250 after a three-minute bidding war at Sotheby’s.

The 10 letters, said to paint a picture of Jagger as a ‘poetic and self-aware’ 25-year-old, were written to the American-born singer while Jagger was in Australia.

In one steamy note, he promises Marsha: ‘I will kiss you softly. And bite your mouth too.’

In other letters, he is more poetic, musing: ‘If I sailed with you around the world/All my sails would be unfurled.’

Miss Hunt provided the inspiration for 
the Stones’ 1971 hit Brown Sugar and gave birth to Jagger’s child Karis 
in 1972 after a three year love affair.

Now 66, she said she was selling the letters because she was ‘broke’ and needed to make repairs to her home in France.

Asked recently if Jagger supported the sale, she said: ‘I don’t think so but they’re not his.’

The auctioneer is so worried about legal action from Jagger, they have taken the unusual step of not releasing substantial extracts from the letters to the media.

Speaking after yesterday’s sale, Miss Hunt said: ‘The passage of time has given these letters a place in our cultural history.

‘1969 saw the ebbing of a crucial, revolutionary era, highly influenced by such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, James Brown and Bob Dylan.

‘Their inner thoughts should not be the property of only their families, but the public at large, to reveal who these influential artists were – not as commercial images, but their private selves.’

Written from his film set for Ned 
Kelly in the outback just after the Stones’ landmark Hyde Park concert, 
the documents provide a glimpse into the singer as a young man.

There
are mentions of the events and people of the time such as the first 
moon landing, John Lennon and Yoko Ono and the Isle of Wight festival.

And
also included are also references to the death of former Rolling Stones
band mate Brian Jones and Jagger’s difficult relationship with Marianne
Faithfull.

Gabriel Heaton, 
Sotheby’s books specialist, said: ‘Here we see Mick Jagger not as the 
global superstar he has become, but as a poetic and self-aware 
25-year-old with wide-ranging intellectual and artistic interests.

‘They
provide a rare glimpse of Jagger that is very different from his public
persona: passionate but self-contained, lyrical but with a strong sense
of irony.’

The letters were sold to a private telephone bidder at around double the estimated price of between £70,000 and £100,000.

Not approved: Mick Jagger, on stage with the Rolling Stones at the O2 in London, is said to have told Ms Hunt to keep the letters private

Sotheby’s have said they were not contacted by Jagger before the sale.

The auctioneer was able to sell the letters without his cooperation because Miss Hunt is the legal owner of the papers themselves – even though he owns the copyright to their contents.

Hunt was a poster girl for the ‘Black is Beautiful’ movement and also the face of ground-breaking West End play Hair.

Born in Philadelphia, she arrived in London in 1966 and performed on the blues circuit with Alexis Korner and a young Elton John.

She had been asked by the Rolling Stones to appear in a photo shoot for ‘Honky Tonk Woman’ but refused on feminist grounds.

But Jagger pursued Hunt, appearing at midnight at the door of her Bloomsbury apartment shortly afterwards.
