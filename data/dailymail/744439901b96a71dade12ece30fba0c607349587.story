Jailed: Convicted fraudster Robert Mitchell was moved to the accounts department of the CQC

The government's care regulator hired a twice-jailed fraudster to work in its accounts department - just months before he was jailed for a third time.

Robert Leslie Mitchell, 61, was allowed to join the Care Quality Commission in 2011 despite openly telling bosses that he had been jailed for huge swindles in 1990 and 1994.

At first he did not deal with money. But in January this year, the CQC's customer services centre in Newcastle moved him to the accounts department - and failed to reconsider his criminal record.

Just four months later he pleaded guilty to conning his own brother-in-law, a geneticist, out of £9,000 by convincing him to invest in a courier business he had already sold.

The CQC suspended him the day after his guilty plea appeared in the regional Chronicle newspaper, and he was later sacked for gross misconduct.

Mitchell has since been jailed for 19 months over the con, but questions have been raised as to how he managed to work with huge sums of cash for a government organisation.

A CQC spokesman said the fraudster was hired as a permanent member of staff in September 2011, where he began as a £21,000-a-year administrator in the Newcastle customer service headquarters.

He was later promoted and held the roles of team leader and officer in the same centre.

In January this year Mitchell was seconded to the accounts team as an accounts liaison administrator, and his record was not re-examined.

He had already declared his convictions from 1990 and 1994 when he joined the regulator, the spokesman added.

Those convictions were a 21-month jail term in 1990 and another three-and-a-half year term in 1994, the second of which was upheld by the Court of Appeal.

For the first crime in 1990, he admitted 21 offences of obtaining £140,000 from customers over a two-year period while he was managing his own financial firm. 

His victims included widow Margaret Speight, who handed over a £30,000 death grant given to her when her husband died in 1988.

Then, in 1994, the businessman was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for taking an elderly couple's life savings after advertising for investors for his catering company 'The Big Bite'.

He appealed his three-and-a-half-year term, but Court of Appeal judge Mr Justice Morland upheld his sentence and described him as 'a menace to gullible and unsophisticated investors'.

In the latest case, North Tyneside Magistrates' Court heard Mitchell had committed two frauds against his brother-in-law Dr David Manning, 54.

He convinced Dr Manning to invest £9,000 in a courier business after telling him it had been his sister Yvonne's dying wish, and a 'golden opportunity' to make some money.

Yvonne had been married to Mitchell for a year when she died from cancer, aged 50, in 2005.

In the years after her death, the brothers-in-law stayed in touch and Mitchell suggested the investment when they went on holiday together. 

In 2008, Dr Manning handed over £4,000 to help Mitchell expand his delivery business Fastway Couriers, and the following year he gave him a further £5,000, the court heard.

Yet despite Mitchell claiming the company was doing well, he had sold it just days after the first investment.

Mitchell was transferred for sentencing last month at Newcastle Crown Court, where a judge handed him 19 months' jail for the two frauds in 2008 and 2009.

A CQC spokesman said: 'Robert Leslie Mitchell was suspended from CQC with immediate effect on May 7, 2014 and was subject to internal disciplinary procedures for gross misconduct. He was subsequently dismissed from his position.

'Mr Mitchell declared his convictions when he first applied to CQC and these were considered and he was cleared for appointment.

'The position was not reconsidered when he applied for a temporary role in the Finance Team two years later.'
