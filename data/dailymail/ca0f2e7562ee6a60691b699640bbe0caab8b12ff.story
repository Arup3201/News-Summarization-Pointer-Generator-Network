'Betrayal of trust': Stephen Benson, 50, gained the befriended the families of his victims before abusing them

A games teacher befriended the parents of three teenage girls before abusing and raping them while on holiday with their families.

Stephen Benson, 50, gained the trust of the families and 'groomed' their young daughters for his own 'sexual gratification' over a period of more than 20 years.

At Ipswich Crown Court yesterday, he was convicted of nine rape charges, six indecent assaults and two counts of sexual activity with a child in what the court described as a 'gross betrayal of trust.'

Benson, of Ipswich, Suffolk, was also found not guilty of two rape offences. He was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing on April 29.

He taught PE at Copleston High in
 Ipswich, Suffolk since 1986, but the offences related to his position at Ipswich Harriers Athletics Club, with the offences carried out between 1989 and 2011.

During the trial, a jury heard how the coach was regularly invited into the homes of his victims and was seen as part of the family.

He would be a regular for family meals at some of the girls' houses, later carrying out sexual assaults in their bedrooms while practicing 'massage'.

Benson was even invited on family holidays where he continued the abuse.

Coach Benson - at the time of his arrest - told cops he admitted to sexual relations with one of the girls, but only when she was over the age of consent.

The victims claim they had not complained to anyone about what was happening because they were either too embarrassed or did not think anyone would believe them.

The court heard how the school girls submitted to his demands until they were old enough to know better and managed to break away.

Awaiting sentencing: Benson was found guilty of nine rape charges at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday

Riel Karmy-Jones, prosecuting, told the jury the defendant was a respected coach who had recruited the youngsters to the athletics club and had been 'manipulative and controlling'.

She said: 'He wormed his way into their lives and was initially charming and expressed interest in their daughters' talents.

'He controlled their eating, sleeping and social lives, they submitted to his sexual advances until they were old enough to know better.

'He stole the last part of their childhoods by drawing them into sexual relationships with him.'

Miss Karmy-Jones said the sexual behaviour was 'wrong on any moral compass' given the girls' ages and his position of authority.

She added: 'Mr Benson denied the allegations when interviewed by police and said one of the girls 'idolised him'.

Coach: The offences related to Benson's position at Ipswich Harriers Athletics Club from 1989 to 2011

After the verdicts, the Senior Crown Prosecutor for CPS East of England, Andrea Reynolds, said the parents had trusted Benson believing he had their children's best interests at heart.

She said: 'This was a gross betrayal of trust by a man who used his position as a sports coach with Ipswich Harriers Athletics Club to groom three young girls so he could rape two of them and sexually assault all three.

'Parents who trusted their daughters to him were manipulated by Benson into thinking he had the girls' best interests at heart.

'They believed he would make the girls successful athletes - when in fact he had other motives in mind.

Position of trust: Benson worked as a teacher at a school in Ipswich

'I would like to thank the victims and witnesses in this case who assisted police, and particular thanks are due to Detective Constable Wendy Leah, who worked tirelessly on the investigation.

'Without the victim's support for the case, Benson would not have been brought to justice. I hope the victims are now able to move on positively with their lives knowing justice has been done.'

Chairman of Ipswich Harriers, yesterday said: 'Protecting children and vulnerable adults from any kind of harm is a priority for Ipswich Harriers and we have thorough and comprehensive safeguarding arrangements in place.

'As soon as these allegations were brought to our and UK Athletics' attention, Stephen Benson's UK Athletics coaching licence was suspended with immediate effect.

'From that point forward he had no more contact with children involved in the club.'

One victim previously told the court in February how she was raped by her athletics coach when she was a teenager.

She said Benson had sex with her after a training session. She told how they had gone for a run together and he had later suggested they had sex.

The woman claimed Benson 
started having sex with her when she was 15 and alleged it took place on
 between six and eight occasions without her consent.

The victim said: 'I wasn't a strong 
person at that point. My parents did everything for me. I wasn't 
confident enough and I was scared.'

The witness denied a suggestion from 
Mrs Perry that her parents had known about her relationship with Benson 
and had been happy about it.
