Luis Suarez would have had his bite ban shortened had he not concocted a ludicrous defence in which he claimed he ‘fell’ into his opponent.

The disgraced Uruguay star had claimed in a letter to FIFA that in no event did he bite or ‘try to bite’ Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during Tuesday’s World Cup clash in Natal.

But members of the disciplinary committee were infuriated by  Suarez’s pathetic mitigation and threw the book at him, banning him from all football for four months as well as nine international games.

Accident? Luis Suarez told FIFA he did not deliberately bite Giorgio Chiellini but fell on top of him

Big miss: FIFA have been formally informed of Uruguay's appeal against Suarez's ban

About time: Suarez has delayed his apology to Chiellini but has promised he will never behave like that again

FIFA’s written reasons for the sanction emerged yesterday and the document quotes from Suarez’s explanation of the collision with Chiellini.

Suarez submission to FIFA said: ‘In the run-up to the impact, my knees came together, I lost my balance and that destabilised my body and I fell into my opponent. In that moment, my face came into collision with the player, causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my teeth, which caused the referee to stop play. That is what happened and in no event did I, as is written in the document, “bite” or “try to bite”.’

Suarez’s defence will be an embarrassment to Liverpool who are  desperate to sell the striker despite knowing he cannot command the £80million transfer figure talked about prior to the shocking incident. Uruguay went on to beat Italy 1-0 and qualify for the last 16 and set up last night’s clash with Colombia.

Suarez’s claim of innocence was a huge misjudgment. The FIFA  Disciplinary Commission noted he did not show ‘any contrition or repentance of any type, nor did he admit any  violation of FIFA regulations’.

Painful: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back Chiellini

Evidence: Chiellini looked outraged as he showed the referee the apparent point of impact on his shoulder
