A Premier League goalkeeper last night dedicated his penalty save and his side's dramatic victory to his young son who tragically died of leukaemia last year.

In an emotional return to football, Liverpool's Brad Jones helped his team to a thrilling 3-2 win over Blackburn after being called on as an emergency substitute.

The 30-year-old had taken time out from the game to mourn the death of his five-year-old child, Luca, who passed away in November following an 18-month battle with cancer.

But the team's third-choice shot-stopper found himself making his Premier League debut for the club when their number two, Alexander Doni, was sent off half-way through the first half.

Jones immediately saved a penalty from Blackburn striker Yakubu and celebrated by pointing to the sky in an apparent tribute to Luca.

At that point, Liverpool were 2-0 up, but two goals from Yakubu set up a tight finish before Liverpool frontman Andy Carroll sealed the win in injury time.

Speaking about the penalty save, Jones told The Guardian: 'What was going through my mind? Many a Friday on the training pitch with Yakubu at Middlesbrough. We used to practise penalties a lot.

'It has been a difficult 18 months with my son passing away. That was for him and obviously for the supporters as well for giving me the support they have.'

It capped a huge week for the 
Australian after becoming a father again a few days ago when girlfriend 
Dani Lawrence gave birth to another boy, Nico Luca.

Before the game, Miss Lawrence tweeted: 'Me and Nico are so proud of you, whatever the final score is. Luca is watching #rip.'

Jones
now finds himself facing one the biggest games of his career when 
Liverpool take on Everton in this weekend's FA Cup semi-final.

He
is the club's only recognised goalkeeper following first-choice Pepe 
Reina's dismissal for violent conduct and Doni's red card.

Even
though he wears the No 1 at Liverpool, Jones has been a back-up keeper 
most of his career, making only 119 appearances in 13 years.

Born
in Perth, Western Australia, the 6ft 3in shot stopper signed for 
Middlesbrough in March 1999. He had to wait until 2004 to make his 
debut, but won a League Cup winner’s medal as a sub against Bolton.

Became a regular for Boro during 2009-10, playing 24 times. Roy Hodgson took him to Anfield for £2million in August 2010.
