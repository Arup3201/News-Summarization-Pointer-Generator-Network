A care worker attacked a vulnerable 88-year-old man in 'revenge' after the dementia patient accidentally broke her mother's arm, a court heard.

Siobhan Koralewski, 30, was a senior carer at Roundstone Residential Home in Scarborough, which her parents owned, when she slapped and bit the elderly patient who had injured her mother.

Ms Koralewski is also accused of mistreating three other dementia patients including one woman who suffered from Down's Syndrome.

Teesside Crown Court heard Ms Koralewski was allegedly angered the 88-year-old victim, who was confused and would lash out, had hurt her mother Margaret, and decided to mistreat her in return.

Nicholas Afkins, prosecuting, told the court today the incident against the man on July 17, 2012, was witnessed by Siobhan's brother, Jeremy, who was employed as a cook in the residential home.

Mr Afkins told jurors: 'The resident suffered from dementia and could become agitated – one day he kicked out at Margaret which caused her to fall on her shoulder.

'The next morning Siobhan decided to mistreat him by way of revenge. Siobhan slapped him across the face four times and Jeremy told her to stop but she ignored him.

'She pulled him by his leg and he fell on the floor then she sat astride him and bounced on top of him. She then squeezed his leg and bit it causing him to cry out in pain.

'Margaret was actually present at the time but she failed to intervene.'

Jeremy Koralewski gave evidence against his mother and sister, who wept as he spoke, and told the court he had shouted at his sister over how she treated the man and three other residents.

The incidents are claimed to have taken place between June 1 and November 30, 2012, and involve the four victims who all suffered from dementia.

One incident involved a woman who suffered from Down's Syndrome - Siobhan was accused of forcing her to consume all of the drinks she had left for her during the day.

The defendant was alleged to have told her boyfriend at the time she stuffed toilet roll in the resident's mouth to stop her from screaming.

Siobhan Koralewski and Margaret Koralewski, 67, both of North Yorkshire, are accused of four counts of neglect and ill treatment of a person who lacks capability.

The pair deny the charges. The trial continues.
