A political group pushing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for the Democratic presidential nomination is trying to rally people around making her husband the
country's 'first lady.'

Bill Clinton occupied the oval office from 2001 to 2009, and the idea of the famous political lothario being called America's 'first gentleman' has made the late-night comedy rounds already.

But the 'Bill for First Lady' political action committee is for real, releasing videos, sponsoring social media accounts and hosting
events that feature a walking bobble-head mask
of the former president  – complete with  a red dress and high heels.

BUBBA, PART DEUX: Hillary Clinton supporters are pushing online ads and personal appearances by a 'first lady' Bill Clinton as a PR stunt urging the former secretary of state to run for the White House

AVERT YOUR EYES: 'Bill' trades his Barbara Bush-style red dress and high heels for a star-spangled bikini in one video, suggesting how he might appear during campaign stops in South Carolina

The independent group plans to take the live-action comic character to the
early-voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa in support of
Hillary, though she has yet to formally announce her campaign.

'They always said Hillary wore the pants. Now I'm wearing the dress,' the character says in an Arkansas drawl in one online video. 

'Put Hillary in the White House. I am homesick.'

Another ad features young girls reciting a laundry list of feminist issues Hillary Clinton supports, while encouraging her to get into the race. 

'As president, Hillary's experience will impress,' the say, 'but as first lady, Bill will rock the dress.' 

The ads were developed by Luke Montgomery, the creative force behind a highly controversial 'Potty-Mouth Princesses' video campaign.

Americans have never seen a man in the role of 'first lady,'
which is a ceremonial title associated with entertaining and promoting social issues. 

Many are confused about what to even call a husband put into the
traditionally female job.

The Bill character's outfit is reminiscent of former First
Lady Barbara Bush's look: a boxy red sheath and shrug,
coordinating heels, blue handbag and belt, and a pearl bracelet. 

In photos taken at Miami Beach, he swaps the Capitol Hill attire
for a stars-and-stripes string bikini.

Hillary's love of trousers led her to jokingly call
her supporters the 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuits'
during her first presidential campaign in 2008.

It's her
husband who is infamously associated with dresses –
specifically a blue Gap frock worn by former White House Intern
Monica Lewinsky.

'There's more va-voom in a red dress,' the committee's
campaign manager Luke Montgomery told Reuters about its choice of colors.

SHADES OF 'CREEPY UNCLE SAM': The conservative group Generation Opportunity made waves last year with an ad campaign encouraging young Americans to opt out of Obamacare, featuring a giant Uncle Sam character with a disturbing grin

President Clinton recently kidded with television host
Rachel Ray about the confusion over a husband taking the first-lady role, suggesting he might be the 'first man,' or 'I could
be called Adam.'

Whatever his title, Clinton will have a tough act to follow
in the sartorial realm if his wife is elected.

Current first lady Michelle Obama has planted her flag in the American
fashion world, wearing dresses from top U.S. designers and igniting
crazes for wide belts and the J. Crew brand.

The 'Bill for First Lady' campaign aims to collect 100,000 online 'signatures' urging Mrs. Clinton to run. As of 6:00 p.m. Thursday, however, its total was barely 7,000.
