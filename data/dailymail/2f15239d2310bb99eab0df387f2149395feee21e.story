A defiant Ed Miliband today vowed to win back Ant and Dec's support - after the TV comedy pair said they had lost faith in Labour.

Mr Miliband said he was 'sure' he could convince the Britain's Got Talent presenters to vote Labour on May 7.

The Labour leader's remarks come after the Geordie pair – who insisted they were 'staunchly Labour – laid into the party and claimed they could not see Mr Miliband as Prime Minister.

Former Labour-supporting rocker Noel Noel Gallagher also waded into the debate today - accusing the party of being a 'f*****g waste of space' . 

He also dismissed Mr Miliband is a 'bozo' who was no different to David Cameron.

Mr Miliband responded to the celebrity criticism today. He said: 'I think they said they were floating voters so I've got 78 days to persuade Ant and Dec back on board, and I'm sure we can.

'Look, I think what I would say to Ant and Dec, and the whole country, is I think there's a big choice at this election.

'How do you want the country run? Do you want a government for the rich and powerful or do you want a government for everyday people. That's the government I'd lead.'

The Labour leader faces a tough prospect winning over the 39-year-old I'm A Celebrity Get Me OUt Of Here presenters.

In remarks reported yesterday, they said they followed politics 'keenly' but were disillusioned with Labour and the Tories.

Mr McPartlin said: 'I voted Labour all my life. But last election I voted Tory because I was thoroughly disillusioned with the Labour government.

'Now I'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government. I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.'

Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'

The pair's less-than-complimentary assessment of the Labour leader was backed by the former Oasis front-man Noel Gallagher.

The Mancunian lead singer, who said he used to 'really believe in Tony Blair, said he no longer felt there was anyone to vote for - because 'they're all just career politicians'.

He said Nigel Farage was not 'mentally capable of running a corner shop' – and predicted Boris Johnson would be the next Prime Minister.

The former Oasis lead singer said: 'These days, my own view is that if they truly, truly wanted to f******g better the lives of the people, surely they must all realise that a little bit of conservatism married with a little bit of socialism, married with a little bit of f*****g Ukip and a little bit of Green and a little bit of Lib Democrats would be kind of perfect.

'But they're all into power, they're not into politics. And they're all career politicians and populists. And you know, the next Prime Minister after this one will be Boris Johnson because of that.'

Mr Gallagher said he would cast his ballot at the election, but claimed there was 'nothing to vote for any more'.

He said: 'Yeah, I vote all the time. I'll pick the most ludicrous thing on the f*****g ballot.

'Last time I voted for a little guy who was standing round here as a pirate. I can't not vote, because I think that's copping out, but my vote is to f*****g vote for something ludicrous because the Labour Party are a f*****g waste of time.

'I just don't trust – trust is not the right word – I don't believe in any of them. I really believed in Tony Blair, for right or wrong, and until Al Qaeda flew those planes into those towers.

'Everyone seems to forget that things before that were f*****g alright. And now the Conservatives are just... I mean, what the f**k?

'David Cameron, he's trying to be your mate. 'Oh, I really like The Jam.' Thatcher was just like, 'I'm f*****g you in the arse, f**k what you say.' You can kind of respect that.'

Mr Gallagher, who made the remarks in an interview with the music magazine Quietus, also revealed Russell Brand tries to convince him to become a revolutionary - but said he was not 'into politics' anymore.

He said he watched the comedian on Question Time against Nigel Farage. He said: 'I don't really know a great deal about him, but I saw him on that with Russell.

'He doesn't look like he could be mentally capable of running a corner shop, far less a f*****g country. '
