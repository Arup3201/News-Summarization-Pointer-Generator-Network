A British-based company have been accused of falsely using an American bikini model to advertise their weight-loss supplement.

But the man who trained the 34-year-old mother-of-one has said that she had never used the weight loss supplement.

Michah Lacerte claims the Scottish-based company lifted Wisdom's photograph from his gym's website.

Her photograph is used to promote the Garcina Cambogia weight loss supplement.

Mr Lacerte, who runs the Hitch Fit Gym in Kansas City, said Wisdom had never used the supplement and transformed her body with a dietary plan and exercise.

He said he has contacted the company to demand they remove his client's photo.

Having waited almost a week in vain for the company to remove the photo he is now taking legal action.

'We teach how to work hard, how to eat right, how to make the right choices and when a company goes and steals something that was ours and slap their label on that and try to sell product ... it is wrong. It is unethical. It is illegal,' Mr Lacerte said.

'I'm going to continue calling this company until I take it down and take it even steps further through social media,' he said.

On the Hitch Fit Gym's website, Ms Wisdom details how she transformed her body.

Ms Wisdom lost over 30lbs in weight and after six months of intensive workouts had changed drastically changed her body.

The Garcinia Cambogia extract has been described as the 'Holy Grail of Weight Loss' by its distributors.

The distributers claim Hydroxy Citric Acid found in the plant from South America stops carbohydrates being turned into fat and also lowers a person's appetite.

The website for the weight-loss pill lists an address in Linlithgow, West Midlothian, Scotland for customer service.

It also has an address in Savannah, Georgia.

Calls to the customer service number in Scotland are rerouted to a call center in Colorado.

A spokesman for the distributors was unavailable to comment.

Ms Wisdom's amazing results came through diet and sheer hard work, her trainer said
