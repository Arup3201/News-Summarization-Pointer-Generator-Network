Mugshot: Justin Bieber is fighting to stop the release of an embarrassing clip of him peeing in his jail cell after his January 23 arrest

A legal motion by Justin Bieber's attorneys to block the release of video footage that reportedly shows him urinating in a jail cell has been revealed.

The images were taken by cameras inside a Miami police station after the 19-year-old was arrested for DUI. Miami police have already released one video of the pop star's arrest, in January, showing him getting a pat down at the station.

But Bieber is afraid of a more embarrassing video which shows him urinating and his lawyers have asking the court to block the video from being released because it shows his ‘private parts’.

Documents state that the 19-year-old 
singer was captured by cameras ‘in various states of undress which show 
intimate personal parts of the defendant's body’.

The
 papers say that various media outlets have requested the footage and 
ask Florida County Court to order a stay on all requests of the teen in 
state custody to prevent 'irreparable harm'.

A source who
 has viewed the video told TMZ: 'Justin is seen several times stumbling 
around while he was taking his tests. As if he had a problem with his 
balance ... [the video] also shows Justin taking his various tests and 
eventually taking a piss.

'The
 stumbling and going to the bathroom is obviously reason enough for his 
attorneys to request it be sealed ... If I was trying to paint a picture
 that my client was innocent ... I wouldn’t want a video of him 
stumbling around and looking out of it to go public either.

This isn't the first time that Beiber has been caught urinating in an inappropriate place.

The
 singer was filmed last year peeing in a mop bucket at  New York City 
restaurant - for some reason saying 'F*** Bill Clinton' at the end of 
the clip.

The video 
released last week shows Bieber being frisked by Miami police after he 
was taken in for CUI, drag-racing and driving with an invalid license on
 January 23.

Controversial: Miami police have already released a video of Bieber getting a pat-down at a police station - these documents were filed in the hope that all the videos will be blocked

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is expected to make a decision on the 19-year-old's fate in around a week

Complying with orders: Putting on a typically confident display, the 19-year-old singer can be seen strutting around as he follows the officer's orders

Legal woes: It has since been claimed he was under the influence of prescription drugs, including Xanax, and marijuana at the time of his arrest

Appearing
 rather peeved by his arrest, the troubled Canadian pop star's entire 
body was patted down by cops as he was forced to comply with their 
orders.

Leaning on a table 
as the police officer gets to work at the task in hand, the Baby 
hitmaker seemed to be taking his time as he meandered around the area.

Wearing
 a dark hoodie, baggy black shorts and red trainers, the teen heartthrob
 is told to remove his shoes as the search takes place.

Although
 the police officer in question seems to be paying close attention to 
searching Bieber, they found nothing on him after the frisk took place.

However,
 it has since been claimed he was under the influence of prescription 
drugs, including Xanax, and marijuana at the time of his arrest.

Later
 tests revealed his blood alcohol level was below the limit for drivers,
 but at the age of 19, the young star is still two years underage.

Bieber
 told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had
 taken a prescription drug, claiming that his mother gave him the 
medication.

The singer could now be charged with felony vandalism after  allegedly pelting his neighbour's property with eggs last month.

The
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has sent the case to the 
district attorney, with officers strongly recommending prosecution on a 
more serious felony charge after an estimated $20,000 in damages was 
caused.

Lt. Dave Thompson 
told TMZ: 'I went to the D.A.'s Office today with the paperwork, and I 
want a felony.  Of course I want a felony.'

The
 website had previously posted a video purportedly taken in the middle 
of the attack, which occurred in the upmarket Calibasas area, in which 
the pop star seems to be heard taunting his neighbor.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is expected to make a decision on the 19-year-old's fate in around a week.

It
 comes hot on the heels of his party pal Lil Za being charged with three
 felonies in connection to a raid on Justin's $6million mansion last 
week.

It has been reported 
L.A. County D.A. has charged the rapper with two counts of felony 
possession of a controlled substance, and another relating to breaking a
 jail telephone.

Police made
 the charges after they had initially been called to Justin's house 
following the egg pelting incident. If found guilty he could face up to 
nine years in prison.

Za, 
real name Xavier Smith, was arrested earlier this month when drugs, 
believed to be Xanax and Ecstasy, were found at the mansion.

Bieber has also been accused of abusing a flight attendant on a private jet until she was forced to hide in the cockpit.

The
 troubled teen singer and his entourage were also said to have smoked so
 much marijuana on a flight between Canada and New Jersey that the 
pilots were forced to wear oxygen masks.

Bieber
 his father Jeremy, 38, and ten friends travelled on the leased jet to 
Teterboro airport ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday and were allegedly 
so verbally abusive towards the female flight attendant that she refuses
 to work for him again.

Despite
 several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop 
verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in cockpit
 with the pilots to avoid Bieber and his entourage.

According to an official report, the Bieber men were 'extremely abusive' towards the flight attendant.

'The
 captain of the flight stated that he warned the passengers, including 
Bieber, on several occasions to stop smoking marijuana', the official 
report of the incident, obtained by NBC News, reads.

'The
 captain also stated he needed to request that the passengers stop their
 harassing behavior toward the flight attendant and after several 
warnings asked the flight attendant to stay with him near the cockpit to
 avoid any further abuse.'

In addition to his pending criminal case in Florida, Bieber has another case pending in his native Canada.

Last week he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault on a limo driver.

Meanwhile,
 it has been reported by PageSix that Bieber's waxwork has been taken 
down after fans had continued to touch the figure.

A
 source told them: 'With no ropes or barriers to stop them, thousands of
 fans have had their photographs taken with him since then — but it has 
taken its toll.'

TMZ 
reported that the fight began when Bieber asked for the music to be 
turned up. The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so 
he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself.

The
 driver swatted his hand away and then it allegedly erupted into a 
full-on smack fest as Bieber hit the driver in the head multiple times.

While
 Justin has grown increasingly close to his father in the wake of his 
legal woes, Patti Mallette - who raised the star as a single mother - 
has admitted she has little control over her son's behaviour.

She
 told Access Hollywood Live: 'I've just gotta let go a little and let 
him make some of his own decisions. He's growing up. He's 19. He's not 
my baby. Of course I pray for him and encourage him.'
