The fugitive ex-cop who is wanted for three murders called the father of one of his alleged victims to taunt him about his daughter's death, it was revealed today.

Christopher Jordan Dorner, 33, is suspected of shooting Monica Quan and her fiance Keith Lawrence in their car in Irvine, California, last Sunday as 'punishment' against her father Randall Quan, a former Los Angeles police captain.

Dorner wrote online that he blames Quan for his 2009 firing from the LAPD. Quan represented Dorner at the review board hearings that led to his dismissal. 

The LAPD urged Dorner to turn himself in and on Sunday offered a $1million reward for information leading to his arrest.

Determined: Los Angeles police chief Charlie Beck, right, said raising the $1million reward for information about Christopher Dorner was 'remarkably easy' because the community is terrified

Police Chief Charlie Beck said on Sunday that the $1 million bounty is likely be the largest reward ever offered in Southern California.

He said raising the money was 'remarkably easy' because of the threat Dorner poses to law enforcement officers and their families in the region.

The money came from police unions, local businesses, community groups and local government across Southern California.

'We will not tolerate this reign 
of terror that has robbed us of our security,' Los Angeles Mayor Antonio
 Villaraigosa vowed at a press conference Sunday afternoon.

Yesterday, police searching for Dorner suggested they may use drones in the hunt.

Riverside Police Chief Sergio Diaz said they are 'using all the tools at our disposal' when asked whether drones were being deployed, according to The Express. 

It is believed thermal imaging cameras on the drones could prove crucial in the search.

Custom and Border Patrol spokesman Ralph DeSio added: 'This agency has been at the forefront of domestic use of drones by law enforcement', according to The Express.

It
 was also revealed on Sunday that Dorner received flight training when 
he served in the U.S. Navy and could attempt to steal an airplane to 
escape authorities.

The 
former U.S. Navy Reserve lieutenant is believed to be on the loose after
 he evaded a massive manhunt that had tracked him to Big Bear, 
California.

Police on Sunday dramatically scaled down their search of the mountains in the mountain resort since they found his abandoned burned-out truck there on Friday.

Some 125 heavily-armed officers scoured the area this weekend. That number has now been scaled back to just 25.

Earlier in the afternoon, police and detectives were spotted at the home of Dormer's mother in La Palma, California after they obtained a warrant to search the property.

The strange proclamations from Dormer have elicited little concrete information as to his whereabouts

ABC News reports that Dorner cruelly taunted Mr Quan last Thursday - four days after he allegedly murdered his daughter and 11 hours after he allegedly shot three police officers - one of them fatally.

A man claiming to be Dorner reportedly called the grieving Mr Quan and told him he 'should have done a better job of protecting his daughter.'

In the manifesto that Dorner posted on his Facebook page, he listed Quan and dozens of other people, all of them involved in his firing, as targets. He promises to murder the families of the officers and to kill anyone who tried to stop him.

'I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own... so I am terminating yours,' he wrote.

Scaled back: Officers have reduced their presence in Big Bear Lake, California - Dorner's last known location - have reduced their presence from 125 officers to just 25 on Sunday

Chief Beck revealed Sunday that '50 LAPD
 families' are under armed guard and surveillance because they were 
mentioned as potential targets.

'They are not only targets, but likely likely victims,' he warned at a press conference.

Dorner has already possibly tried to attack one of the names on his list. On Thursday, his truck was spotted in the area of one of the potential targets on the list.

Two LAPD officers guarding the home chased after Dorner and engaged him in a firefight. Dorner responded by unleashing such a punishing flurry of bullets that the officers' squad car was no longer drivable.

One of the officers was grazed in the head by a shot.

Just minutes later, he allegedly pulled up to a Riverside police car that was stopped at a red light and opened fire.

A 34-year-old police trainer with 11-years on the force was killed. A 27-year-old trainee was gravely wounded and remains in intensive care after undergoing surgery. Their names are not being released to protect their families.
