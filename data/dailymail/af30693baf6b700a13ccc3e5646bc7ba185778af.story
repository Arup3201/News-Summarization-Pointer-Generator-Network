It's a staple dairy substitute and increasingly said to be a 'superfood' able to cure an array of ailments from heart disease to Altzheimers.

And as well as coconut water, milk, yoghurt, sugar, flesh and oil, new coconut-based food and beauty products are popping up every day in supermarkets and health food shops.

Hoping to deliver simplified, science-based analysis, weight and health management website vavista.com have enlisted their expert to cautiously debunk or back up claims about this tropical ingredient.

Here, registered dietician Sophie Classens explains the pros and cons of including various coconut products in your shopping basket.

New coconut-based food and beauty products are popping up every day

The juice found in the middle of a cracked coconut is now marketed as a highly hydrating fluid. It has less sugar than fruit juices and more minerals such as potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium. These properties are great as a post-workout drink if you've only been doing moderate exercise, but there isn't enough protein or carbohydrate if you're undergoing vigorous exercise of over 1 hour.

Ultimately, coconut water contains calories - do you need these? If you're drinking purely for hydration, water is always the better choice. You can get the minerals from a well-balanced diet so I wouldn't drink this religiously, but if you enjoy it, have one occasionally.

This is becoming more and more popular and can be bought from supermarkets now. It can be used for roasting and baking.

It has a similar nutritional profile to butter in that it has a high saturated fat content which is currently being discovered to be less harmful to health than initially thought, particularly the type of saturated fats which are found in coconut oil: Lauric acid and Myristic acid.

Coconut oil also contains some poly and mono-unsaturated fats which bring additional health benefits. It is still an energy-dense food so should be used in moderation.

This can be used instead of sugar in baking. It has a lower GI than standard granulated sugar, however a similar kcal content per gram. It may be a healthier alternative to traditional granulated sugar, however it is still an energy-dense food-type which should only be used on special occasions.

This is a fairly new dairy-free alternative, great for those who are lactose-intolerant and who fancy a change from the soya varieties! It is much higher in fat than both natural dairy yoghurt and soya yoghurts, but also much lower in carbohydrates; research is now beginning to find that a diet higher in fat than carbohydrate can aid weight loss efforts.

Steer clear of the flavoured varieties, as with all yoghurt types in fact, as they're packed with lots of sugar. A 150g serving can provide you with a good, filling 200kcal snack which should keep you feeling full due to the high fat percentage.

Black Sheep Coffee in north London are pioneering the oil and butter-packed coffee trend, controversially said to help with weight management and raise IQ.

A serving costs £3.50, and contains two to six tablespoons of Kerrygold unsalted grass-fed butter, two tablespoons of MCT coconut oil, and two cups of hot coffee brewed with low-toxin beans, all blended until they are frothy like a foamy latte.

Just one cup can contain 50g of fat, (more than 40g of that saturated) and 450 calories.

It's full of brain power-boosting vitamin K2-dense butter and metabolism-boosting oil - but lacks other essential nutrients.

Fresh coconut flesh is delicious and full of vitamins and minerals. Plus it goes well in smoothies

Fresh coconut flesh is delicious, full of vitamins and minerals and goes really well in a smoothie. Enjoy as a snack but go easy on your portion sizes - a typical snack pack (100g) of fresh coconut pieces contains 271kcal compared to just 50kcal in a 100g fresh fruit pot. Just a few pieces should be enough to get you through to the next meal.

There are two types of coconut milk widely available - one is about 8 per cent coconut cream mixed with water, sugar and preservatives, the other is mixed with rice milk without the need for sugar and requires less preservatives.

Both have a similar kcal content to soya milk (about 1/2 that of semi-skimmed milk) but a much lower protein content than both soya and semi-skimmed milk. I would suggest going for the no added sugar option; ensure that if opting for coconut milk you choose one with added calcium and vitamin D which cannot be naturally found in this product.
