A Russian rocket blasted off today to deliver three new crew members to the International Space Station - including Italy's first female astronaut.

Soyuz TMA-15M, holding incoming station commander Terry Virts, with the US space agency Nasa, left the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazahkstan.

Also on board for the lift-off at 3am local time (Sunday 9pm GMT) was Soyuz commander Anton Shkaplerov, with the Russian Federal Space Agency. 

Here we go: Russia's Soyuz TMA-15M spacecraft  blasts off from the launch pad at Russian-leased Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazahkstan today

We have lift off: Russia's Soyuz TMA-15M rocket is delivering three new crew members to the International Space Station

And they're off: The astronauts were expected to reach the station, which flies about 260 miles above Earth, less than six hours after taking off

Launch: The crew face a busy six months in orbit, including a trio of spacewalks to prepare the station for a new fleet of space taxis

Space adventure: They are due to begin flying crew to the International Space Station in late 2017

Completing the trio was first-time flier Samantha Cristoforetti, with the European Space Agency.

They were expected to reach the station, which flies about 260 miles above Earth, less than six hours after lift-off.

The station, owned and operated by 15 nations, serves an orbiting laboratory for life science, materials research and technology development.

It also hosts other experiments that take advantage of the unique microgravity environment and vantage point of space.

Mr Virts said: ‘I think that 100 (or) 500 years from now, people will look back on this as the initial baby steps that we took going into the solar system.

‘In the same way that we look back on Columbus and the other explorers 500 years ago, this is the way people will look at this time in history.’

The £64billion research laboratory has been short-staffed since November 9.

Then, Russian cosmonaut Maxim Suraev, European astronaut Alexander Gerst and NASA's Reid Wiseman returned home after  five months in orbit.

The crew face a busy six months in orbit, including a trio of spacewalks to prepare the station for a new fleet of U.S. commercial space taxis.

They are due to begin flying crew to the station in late 2017.

Miss Cristoforetti, 37, an Italian Air Force pilot, deflected questions about becoming Italy's first female astronaut during a press conference.

Speaking in Russian, she said through a translator: ‘I have done nothing special to be the first Italian woman to fly to space.

'I just wanted to fly to space and I happen to be the first.'

When asked by a reporter if she planned wear cosmetics in space, Miss Cristoforetti looked confused.

She then replied, ‘Maybe you should ask Terry. Maybe he wants to take some makeup with him.’
