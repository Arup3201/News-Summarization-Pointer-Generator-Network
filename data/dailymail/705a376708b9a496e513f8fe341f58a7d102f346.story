The mother of a second child cared for by Irish nanny Aisling McCarthy Brady –who was with her at the time emergency services were summoned to the ailing Rehma Sabir – asked her to babysit the next day.

The twist in the horrific story is one of a number of revelations that emerged yesterday and that Mrs McCarthy Brady’s defence attorney says are anomalies which ‘just don’t add up’.  

Last night neighbours of Mrs McCarthy Brady’s husband, Don McCarthy, told the Irish Mail on Sunday that while his wife remains in prison, he has left the home they shared.

Police claim that the 34-year-old nanny, who moved from Co. Cavan to the US in 2002, assaulted year-old Rehma Sabir on January 14, causing head injuries. The child died two days later.

But now a series of details that contradict the prosecution’s account are emerging. Among them are the identities of two other women who were in the apartment with Mrs McCarthy Brady as she tried to revive the baby.

While the prosecution statement says that Rehma’s father Sameer, a British national, ‘left the home at 7.30am to take his in-laws to the airport’, a Boston Herald report, based on an interview with Mrs McCarthy Brady’s defence attorney, says his mother-in-law was at their apartment that afternoon and tried to revive the child.

The other woman present was the mother of the second child, a seven-month-old boy who had been entrusted to Mrs McCarthy Brady’s care as part of a nanny-sharing arrangement involving Rehma’s mother Nadi Siddiqui. Now it has emerged in the Boston Herald that the second mother, who has not been named, asked Mrs McCarthy Brady to babysit her son as Rehma lay dying in ­hospital. The nanny received the request by text while with Rehma’s parents at the hospital where the little girl was fighting for life.

Prosecutors say Rehma suffered a violent assault that left spinal injuries ‘consistent with the slamming of a child’. She was taken to hospital with multiple fractures, bleeding behind her eyes and swelling on her brain.

The prosecutor’s statement details scans showing up long bone fractures on the baby’s left forearm and left leg, along with compression fractures on her spine.

The documents also note that some of the injuries dated back weeks or even months.

Melinda Thomson, Mrs ­McCarthy Brady’s lawyer, told the Boston Herald that her client was ‘devastated, totally devastated’, adding: ‘I have gone through the police report line by line, over and over and over again. I can’t sleep thinking about this. Things just don’t add up.’ She added that Mrs ­McCarthy Brady faces weeks of waiting, as prosecutors will study the autopsy report in detail before moving forward with their case.

Meanwhile, neighbours of Mrs McCarthy Brady said that her husband David has left their marital home at Beale Street, Quincy. A neighbour said: ‘He’s moved out and won’t be back, as far as we know. Someone came in the middle of the night and removed his car and his things.’ Cork-born David McCarthy was said to have been ‘floored’ by the allegations.

Last night, attorney Elaine Whitfield Sharp, who defended Louise Woodward, the British au pair accused of murdering her eight-month-old charge in 1997, said Mrs McCarthy Brady’s case was ‘winnable’ for the defence.

‘The timing is what is crucial here,’ she said of the events of January 14, when Rehma was taken to hospital. ‘That is what the defence is going to rely on. What other people had access (to the child) and when did they have access.'
