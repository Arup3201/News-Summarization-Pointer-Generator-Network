For months the art world has breathed a collective sigh of relief as they have been spared the withering pronouncements of Britain’s leading art critic.

Now Brian Sewell has spoken for the first time of the cancer that has led to his absence from public life – and revealed how an operation to remove the tumour left him with what he calls ‘my Picasso ear’.

And as he recovers from surgery, Mr Sewell, 82, has lost none of his feared acerbic wit, taking aim at Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota and labelling famed art historian Lord Clark a ‘fraud’.

Brian Sewell has spoken for the first time of the cancer that has led to his absence from public life

In an operation last week, Mr Sewell had his right ear virtually removed and then re-attached so the tumour could be taken out, leaving him with a ‘disconcerting’ feeling.

‘It feels to me as though it is slightly misplaced,’ he said, jokingly likening it to the way Picasso rearranged features in his Cubist portraits.

Mr Sewell said he first noticed a ‘small and squishy’ lump behind his ear in January, but ignored it. But after it grew increasing painful, he went to his GP and was referred to specialists at the Royal Marsden hospital in Fulham, West London.

Doctors found what he called a ‘tiresome’ tumour in his neck, and initially believed it could easily be removed. But after further tumours were found in his lungs and ‘what they rather vulgarly called my gut’, a planned operation was delayed, and he feared he was facing ‘the kiss of death’.

At one stage, he believed his condition was inoperable and terminal. But he did not contemplate suicide – despite an article he wrote for The Mail on Sunday last year, in which he had endorsed assisted suicide for those with terminal conditions and said he might one day take ‘pills and gin’ to take his own life.

His surgeon then decided he could operate, but warned of what Mr Sewell calls the ‘ghastly prospect’ that they might sever his facial nerve and leave him badly disfigured.

Happily, the operation was successful. Although Mr Sewell now faces months of radiotherapy, he said he is now ‘relieved, ebullient and hugely grateful’ that ‘my life has been given back to me’.

His sense of mischief is undimmed as he teased enemies such as the Tate’s Sir Nicholas, whom he has repeatedly vilified for championing modern art. Mr Sewell joked: ‘The one consolation I have is that I have frustrated the Serota Tendency by surviving the operation. I have not gone yet.’

He also described attending the Tate Britain exhibition Kenneth Clark: Looking For Civilisation, and declared: ‘I thought what an old fraud this man was. He had absolutely no eye. It aroused my anger, which is perhaps a healthy thing.’

Speaking from the South London home he shares with his beloved dogs Lottie and Gretel, Mr Sewell said the operation had left him with vivid scars around his ear and down his neck.

‘It looks pretty vile,’ he admitted. ‘It looks like we are in the 15th Century and the Tower of London and someone has attempted rather badly to chop my head off. I have the feeling that there are lots of tiny men surrounding my ear who are tugging it to try to get it back to where it should be.’

He also insisted that his brush with death had not changed his approach to art: ‘I don’t feel that because I might be dying I should be charitable.’

With his thoughts turned towards mortality, he has considered what will happen to his body after death. ‘I wish I could leave it to Pedigree Chum,’ he said. ‘I really don’t see why dog lovers shouldn’t end up as dogs’ dinners.’
