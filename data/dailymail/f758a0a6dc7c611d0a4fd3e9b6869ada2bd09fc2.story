gone too soon: Dammion Heard, 20, a student at Western State Colorado University, was found dead not far from from campus five days after his disappearance

A brief search for a missing collegiate wrestler ended on a tragic note Wednesday when he was found dead not far from his Colorado college campus five days after his disappearance.

The body of 20-year-old Dammion Heard was discovered on Bureau of Land Management property 8 miles east of Gunnison, Colorado. His 2004 Saturn Vue was found nearby.

Heard was last seen alive last Saturday in the vicinity of Western State Colorado University, where he was a freshman studying petroleum geology.

The Gunnison Police Department said that no suspects are being pursued, and that the circumstances surrounding Heard's death do not pose a threat to the Western State campus.

During his senior year at Fossil Ridge High School in Texas, Heard won the 2013 state wrestling title in the 113-pound weight class, The Star-Telegram reported.

His high school wrestling coach Tony Lopez told the paper that Heard had been a wrestler since childhood, and that his father, Gary Heard, helped train him. 

Western State Colorado interim president Brad Baca released a statement Wednesday reacting to Heard's passing.

'Dammion was a vibrant and beloved member of the campus community, a great student and an accomplished athlete,' the statement read. 'Our hearts and thoughts are with his family and friends.'

The college held a prayer circle in Heard's honor Wednesday night, and a candle vigil will take place Monday night at Fossil Ridge High School. 

Those who knew the 20-year-old student athlete from Azle, Texas, were left wondering about what may have led to the tragedy.

On his Facebook page, the handsome, 5-foot-7, 125-pound student appeared well-liked and popular, with dozens of photos depicting him laughing and hanging out with friends.

Coach Lopez said Heard had always struck him as smart and 'calm-headed.'

Meanwhile, Heard's current and former classmates and wrestling partners took to Twitter to express their grief at his untimely passing.
