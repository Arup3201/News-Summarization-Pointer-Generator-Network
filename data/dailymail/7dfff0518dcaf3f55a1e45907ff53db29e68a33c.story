A man who was shot dead outside a home in Sydney's west on Sunday night was a victim of a conflict between two warring families.

In the third shooting incident between the families, Bilal Taha, also known as Bill, was shot just before 6pm outside a residence in Condell Park and  later died in hospital of his bullet wounds.

'The death of this person in a very violent and targeted shooting was as a direct result of a current conflict between two families,' said Detective Superintendent Steve Eardley.

Bill Taha, 34, was killed outside of a home in Condell Park on Sunday night as part of a feud between families

Mr Taha, 34, was the victim of 'significant criminal activity' between the two warring families.

'We believe this current dispute is a direct result of this criminal activity,' Superintendent Eardley added.

He called for a cease of the recurring violence, asking for the heads of the warring families to take responsibility to ensure the bloodshed stopped immediately. 

'The patriarchs and the matriarchs of these families need to pull these families in line,' he said.

'Enough is enough. There has been enough bloodshed, there has been enough loss of life.'

One neighbour who heard the gunshots and called the police said the incident was terrifying.

'It’s traumatic. He was conscious, then he slipped away. They resuscitated him before they put him in the ambulance. He was bleeding quite a bit. It was horrible,' she said.

'The mum had just had knee surgery and was sitting there watching him,' she told The Daily Telegraph. 

Mr Taha owned and operated the company City Design and Construction and worked in the building industry

'We believe this current dispute is a direct result of this criminal activity,' Superintendent Eardley said

Another neighbour said that they had heard up to five gunshots.

'They were very quick ‘bang, bang, bang’ directly after each other. When I ran to the front window there were people everywhere. He was in the driveway his feet towards the road. There was a lot of screaming, a lot of people came out of that house,' she said. 

Family members and friends took to social media to grieve for Mr Taha.

'I carry your heart with me, I carry it in my heart...... RIP Bill... xoxo,' posted one family member.

Later they wrote on Facebook, 'may your soul be at peace we love you so much losing you has shattered us habibi broken us all'. 

Other friends wrote 'Death is so final, makes me feel so helpless,' and another posted on Facebook, 'rest easy now brother Bill'. 

Mr Taha owned and operated the company City Design and Construction and worked in the building industry.

 Detectives from the State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad are expected to aid in investigations into the shooting

Superintendent Eardley said that the conflict between the families had been going on for around two months but wouldn't comment on reports that the victim's mother saw her son shot.

'The community and the police have had enough of this violence. We cannot tolerate his type of behaviour in our community,' he said.

'This has happened in a quiet suburban street.'  

Investigators have been told a car drove from the scene shortly after the shooting at about 6.10pm and they want anyone with information about the incident to contact Crime Stoppers.

In a separate incident four hours later, several shots were fired at a property in Kibo Road at Regents Park.

Police believe two men drove to the house and spoke to occupants outside the home and a number of shots were fired before the pair drove away.

There were no reports of injuries, but a woman in her 50s and a teenage girl were treated for shock.  

Detectives from the State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad are expected to aid in investigations into the shooting.

Authorities have been told a car drove from the scene shortly after the shooting.
