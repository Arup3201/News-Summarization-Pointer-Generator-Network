Madonna was branded a 'slut' by a leading Russian politician

As one of the world’s most provocative pop stars, Madonna’s often on the receiving end of strong comment.

But even she may be wincing today after one of Vladimir Putin’s right-hand men described her as a ‘moralising slut’.

Paying the price for interfering with Russian politics, the star was told: ‘Either take off your cross, or put on your knickers.’

The attack on Twitter by deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin came as Madonna vowed to back gay campaigners during her concert last night in St Petersburg where there is a legal ban on promoting homosexuality to young people.

Earlier the 53-year-old had offended the Kremlin by demanding the release of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot  who face probable jail for an anti-Putin protest in a Moscow cathedral. 

Rogozin said on the messaging site: ‘With age, every former s. tries to lecture everyone on morality.’

While he didn’t use the entire word, the meaning was clear to all as the Russian word for ‘slut’ or ‘whore’. At her Moscow concert earlier in the week, Madonna scrawled the words ‘Pussy Riot’ on her back and sang ‘Like a Virgin’ wearing the punk group’s balaclava. 

There were calls for Madonna to face prosecution if she goes ahead with any kind of stunt in St Petersburg that could be construed as ‘homosexual propaganda’.  

Pink wristbands were to be distributed at the concert.

‘If this is the case, steps will be taken to open an administrative probe, and she will face a fine for violating this law,’ said one source in the St Petersburg legislature.

Local law-makers this year enacted fines for those 'promoting homosexuality' to minors, equating it with paedophilia. Gay Pride marches are effectively illegal in the city.

Russia legalised homosexuality in 1993 after the fall of the Soviet Union but only ceased to classify it as a mental disorder in 1999, and homophobic attitudes still run high in the country.
