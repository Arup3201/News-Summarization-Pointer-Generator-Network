Liverpool have revealed their brand new third kit for the forthcoming 2014/15 Premier League season.

Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge have all donned the new strip to show off what the Reds will be wearing during certain away trips next term.

The black and grey striped kit has been manufactured by Warrior and is quite a change from the white, black and purple number of last season.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will be hoping the new away kit brings his side some good luck on the road as they aim to build on last season's brilliant Premier League performance which saw the Reds finish second.

The new kit will also get a showing in Europe as Liverpool will be back in the Champions League for the first time since the 2009/10 season when they were knocked out in the group stages.
