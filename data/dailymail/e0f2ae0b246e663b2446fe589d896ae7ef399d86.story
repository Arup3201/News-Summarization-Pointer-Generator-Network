Found: Police have discovered the body of missing millionairess Carole Waugh, 50, in London

Police erected a tent outside a garage lock-up in the neighbourhood homeowners have described as 'peaceful and quiet'

The body was believed to have been found in this blue VW Golf which was inside the lock-up garage, after police received new information

Miss Waugh, originally from Durham but living in London, had not been seen by her family since mid-April.

Her body was found with a single stab
wound inside a car at the garage in Lime Court, New Malden, south-west 
London, on Thursday night.

The Metropolitan Police said Kutner 
was bailed to return to a police station on August 25 relating to his 
arrest on suspicion of murder and kidnap last Wednesday.

However, he has not been freed because he 
is being held in custody on the fraud charges ahead of an appearance by 
video link at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Kutner has been charged with committing fraud along with unemployed Rakesh Bhayani.

Bhayani, 40, of Chamberlayne Avenue, Wembley, was one of four men and two women arrested by Scotland Yard officers last month in connection with the inquiry into what was then the disappearance of Ms Waugh.

He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on three charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation relating to transactions associated with Ms Waugh's identity worth around £280,000 and remanded in custody to appear at Southwark Crown Court on 25 September.

The five other suspects have been bailed pending further investigations.

Police are patrolling the area as they await the outcome of the postmortem which confirmed the identity of the body to be Carole Waugh

The quiet road has become the scene of a major crime investigation, as police now pursue the possibility that Ms Waugh may have been murdered

Those who worked with Miss Waugh during the eight years she spent in the Libya speak of 'a complex character' who told extraordinary stories about her life in England

Police have been trying to piece 
together the life of a ‘secretive’ and private woman who was known to 
have met men through a variety of internet dating sites.

Those who worked with Miss Waugh 
during the eight years she spent in Libya as a secretary for an oil 
company described her as ‘a fantasist with a reputation for 
exaggeration’.

Despite never marrying, she wore a 
diamond engagement ring and gold wedding band and boasted that her 
wealthy Egyptian husband had died of a heart attack and left her a 
fortune.

She told other secretaries that she 
had rubbed shoulders with film stars at parties in London and she 
claimed to be a property developer.

Miss Waugh said she owned a flat 
behind Harrods and had a top-of-the-range Harley Davidson motorbike, 
despite her modest £25,000 salary.

Police have arrested ten people during the investigation, including arresting one man on suspicion of murder

Known as a party girl, Miss Waugh 
spent her time in Libya at the Janzour Tourist Village, a hotel and 
villa complex overlooking the Mediterranean on the outskirts of Tripoli,
with one of the sons of Colonel Gaddafi, Saif, among her neighbours. 
But little is known about her life after she moved back to London in 
2008.

Her brother Chris, a 53-year-old 
Barclays bank manager, has described her as ‘secretive’, adding: ‘I’m 
embarrassed about how little I knew.’

Her mother Margaret, 78, said after her disappearance: ‘I think the world of her, but she’s a girl you couldn’t talk to.

‘She never gave a good answer, if you know what I mean.

‘She kept everything to herself. She spoke to me two or three times a week, then all of a sudden, nothing.’

The alarm was raised on May 7 after Miss Waugh failed to answer calls from her family after she was last seen on April 16.

Ten people – six men and four women – have been arrested in connection with Ms Waugh’s disappearance and fraud.

Scotland Yard is appealing for information about the blue Volkswagen Golf, which has the registration number W466 NHL.
