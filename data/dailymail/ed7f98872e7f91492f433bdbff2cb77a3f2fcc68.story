Fazan Ahmed, 16, was left with fatal injuries to his head and back when he was struck by a blue car in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on Friday night

A teenager has died two days after being struck by a hit and run driver as police launched a hunt for his killer in a blue car.

Fazan Ahmed was left fighting for his life when he was hit on Jupiter Drive in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire at around 8.25pm on Friday.

The driver did not stop after the collision, leaving the 16-year-old on the road with fatal injuries to his head and back.

Fazan was taken to St Mary's Hospital in London to be treated by a specialist doctors. He died yesterday evening after medical teams spent the weekend battling to save his life.

Police have now launched a manhunt for 
the driver of the blue vehicle, which they said could have had its 
windscreen damaged in the collision.

The schoolboy, who collected his GCSE results at Adeyfield School, Hemel Hempstead, the day before the accident, was playing football with friends just hours before he was hit. Fazan was due to join his friends at sixth-form college this September.

Speaking before Fazan's death,  his mother Izzy Begum, father Mukhtar Ahmed and siblings said: 'He is 
the life and soul of our family with his whole future ahead of him.

'He loves football and is a supporter of Arsenal. His family and friends are devastated beyond belief at what has happened.

'The
 family would like to thank the police, ambulance staff, hospital staff 
and members of the public that helped us so far through this dreadful 
time.

'If you are the driver, or know the driver or can help the police in any way with information please call.'

Following his death, friends took to social media to express their grief.

One friend called him 'a really lovely young gentleman' and described him as 'smart' and 'charming'.

She continued: 'Nobody can replace you. You could have gotten so far! You were known by many and loved by thousands.'

Another, Kash Ahmed, added: 'Fazan Ahmed rip May Allah bless you cousin love u loads gonna be missed loads xxxxxxx'

They also branded the driver who hit him 'scum' and a 'coward' for driving away after causing the fatal injuries.

Detectives were today hunting the driver of the car that struck Fazan. Police said the vehicle might have a damaged windscreen.

Sergeant Sam Cordingley of Hertfordshire Police Roads Policing Unit, who is leading the investigation, said Fazan's death had left the teenager’s family 'devastated'.

He said: 'Firstly, our thoughts go to Fazan’s family and friends following this tragedy. Fazan's family is understandably devastated by what has happened.

'We are continuing to actively seek the driver of the blue car and we would ask that they make contact with police as a matter of urgency.

'We need to speak to you to understand what has happened.

'The vehicle we are seeking is likely to have a broken windscreen, as well as other damage so I’d like to ask for the public’s help in locating the vehicle.

'I would urge anyone who sees a vehicle with similar damage apparently parked up or abandoned to call us.

'I would also appeal to any mechanics, who may encounter a blue vehicle presented for repairs to get in contact before undertaking such work.

'If anyone has seen this vehicle, or has a relative who drives a blue car and may have come home in a distressed state, I would urge you to contact police immediately.'

Anyone with any information about what happened is asked to contact PC Dave Clarke at the collision investigation unit. You can reach him on the Hertfordshire Police non-emergency number 101, quoting reference ISR 697 of August 22.
