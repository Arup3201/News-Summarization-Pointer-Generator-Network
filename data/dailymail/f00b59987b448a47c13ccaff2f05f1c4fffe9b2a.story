Joan Rivers may have been given the same drug that killed Michael Jackson when she went into cardiac and respiratory arrest at a New York clinic, it has been sensationally claimed today.

The 81-year-old comedy legend slipped into a coma and never regained consciousness after being sedated for an endoscopy procedure. She died this afternoon.

The New York State Department of health has launched an investigation into Yorkville Endoscopy, the out-patient  clinic where Rivers went into arrest. The clinic has said it is cooperating fully. 

RadarOnline reports that Rivers was given Propofol, which is often used was an anesthetic for simple medical procedures.

Entertaining to the end: Joan Rivers had her hair and makeup done daily after she slipped into a coma following a routine surgery at a New York City clinic

It is the same drug that gained infamy after it was revealed that the King of Pop died after taking a cocktail of drugs that included Propofol. 

 In the days before her death, she reportedly had her hair and makeup done every day - a testament to the consummate performer's desire to always look her best, the New York Daily News reports. 

Her suit at Mount Sinai Hospital was filled with decoration and flowers in an effort to make her comfortable in her last moments, the newspaper reports. 

New York Post's gossip columnist and Rivers' self-proclaimed ‘forever friend’ Cindy Adams reported Thursday that Joan has been transferred to a larger suite decorated with flowers, plants and bows by celebrity event planner Preston Bailey, who had organized Melissa Rivers' wedding years earlier.

Adams, who was spotted leaving the Manhattan medical center after visiting her friend earlier this week, also said that Rivers lies covered with a white faux mink blanket from designer Dennis Basso's collection and has a CD of the musical Oklahoma! playing in the room, according to Hollywood Life. 

Adams dished about Joan Rivers' upgraded hospital stay, which includes a team of makeup artists, hairdressers and manicurists swarming around her to make sure the legendary fashionista looks her best.

According to the columnist, her nails are painted deep purple and white, and her toenails are green.

Hospital staff even allow Rivers' dogs, a Japanese Chin named Teegan and a Havanese, to be brought into her room so they could give their 'mommy' a kiss.

Ms Rivers was rushed to Mount Sinai a week ago after going into cardiac arrest during an outpatient procedure on her vocal chords.

On Thursday, TMZ reported that the New York state Department of Health is now looking into Yorkville Endoscopy - the clinic where Rivers had the ill-fate surgery.

State officials said they are reviewing the case, but have yet to launch an official investigation.

Spokesman James O'Hare said Thursday that the department is looking into 'the whole matter.' He declined to discuss specifics.

Also today E! network announced that Ms Rivers' weekly Fashion Police series has been put on hiatus in the wake of her hospitalization.

The long-running program, which normally airs fresh episodes on Fridays, is on break this week and next, the network stated, 'as we await Joan and Melissa's return in front and behind the camera.'

Rivers' daughter, Melissa Rivers, is its executive producer.

In its place, the network plans to air two special programs focusing on New York Fashion Week.

Melissa Rivers released a statement Wednesday saying that her mother is being 'kept comfortable' after being moved from ICU into a private room.

She made no reference to whether or not her mother's condition has improved. 

Rivers suffered cardiac arrest and stopped breathing during minor throat surgery on her vocal chords at a New York City hospital last Thursday. 

She was left fighting for her life amid fears she might be left a 'vegetable', but friends have since dismissed these claims and said she is improving day by day at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Her daughter flew from Los Angeles following the incident and has remained at her bedside.

The comedy stalwart had reportedly laughed about undergoing 'a little procedure' ahead of her operation.

Worried: Rivers' daughter Melissa has been by her mother's bedside since the beginning of her health crisis 

Her friend Jay Redack, who was turned away by security when he tried to visit her in hospital, was one of the last people to spend time with her and said she was in good spirits before the surgery.

They had enjoyed dinner on Wednesday night after her hour-long stand-up session at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in Times Square.

'She said her throat was bothering her for a long time,' he told the New York Daily News. 'Her voice was getting more raspy, if that was possible. She said she was just going in for a little procedure in the morning, that was it.'
