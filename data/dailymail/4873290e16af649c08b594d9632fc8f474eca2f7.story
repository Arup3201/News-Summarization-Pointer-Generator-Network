The Santa Barbara massacre that left seven people dead, including gunman Elliot Rodger, on Friday night has already begun to bring calls for tougher gun control laws.

Rodger had three semi-automatic handguns that he had purchased legally from a Southern California gun shop - along with more than 400 rounds of ammunition.

This, despite the family disclosure that he was diagnosed at a young age as being 'a highly functional Asperger Syndrome child' - a form of autism. The family said he had been receiving treatment for disorder.

However, the diagnosis did note make him ineligible to buy firearms in the state of California.

Elliott Rodger bought three handguns from a local gun store. Police say he used them to kill three people and then take his own life

Three weapons: The Glock 34 (lower left) is a competition-grade variation of the popular pistol - made for accuracy and handling. Rodger also had two Sig Sauer P226 pistols (right)

Rodger wrote in his 10,000 word online 
manifesto about buying his first weapon, a Glock 34 semiautomatic 
pistol, at Goleta Valley Gun & Supply in Goleta, California.

'I had already done some research on handguns, and I decided to purchase the Glock 34 semiautomatic pistol, an efficient and highly accurate weapon. I signed all of the papers and was told that my pickup day was in mid-December,' he wrote.

'After I picked up the handgun, I brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power. I was now armed. Who’s the alpha male now, b*****s?'

He later purchased two more handguns - Sig Sauer P226.

All three weapons are semi-automatic pistols chambered in 9mm - similar to what many law enforcement agencies use.

In his online screed, Rodger said that he wanted three pistols so that he could have two at the ready at all times.

'I needed two working handguns at the same time, as that was how I planned to commit suicide; with two simultaneous shots to the head,' he wrote.

This is the gun shop where Rodger said he bought at least his first handgun - Goleta Valley Gun and Supply store in Goleta, California

Police found three pistols in Rodger's car after he crashed it and shot himself dead Friday night

California has some of the toughest handgun restrictions in the state. Gun owners must pass a state and federal background check. They then must wait ten days after the purchase of a handgun before they can pick it up at the store.

Additionally, California residents cannot buy more than one handgun each month. 

Though all three of the pistols were designed to hold at least 15 rounds, California law limits magazine capacity to ten rounds.

Police say Rodger gunned down three people  on his rampage - University of California, Santa Barbara sorority sisters Katie Cooper and Veronika Weiss and UCSB sophomore Chris Martinez.

He also opened fire on sheriff's deputies who arrived on scene, before fleeing, crashing his BMW and taking his own life.

On Saturday, grief-stricken Richard Martinez, the father Chris Martinez blasted the NRA at a press conference.

'Chris was a really great kid. Ask anyone who knew him. His death has left our family lost and broken,' he said. 'Why did Chris die? Chris died because of craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA.

'They talk about gun rights. What about Chris’s right to live? When will this insanity stop? When will enough people say, "Stop this madness, we don’t have to live like this." Too many have died.

'We should say to ourselves: Not one more.'
