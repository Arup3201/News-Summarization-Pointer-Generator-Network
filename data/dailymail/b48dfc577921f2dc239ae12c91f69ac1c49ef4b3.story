Graham Norton has attacked his BBC employers for handing out ‘sacks of cash’ to departing executives.

The chat show host, who is himself one of the corporation’s highest-paid presenters, said the severance pay-off scandal ‘defies belief’ and had ‘dragged the BBC into disrepute’.

But the 50-year-old entertainer also admitted that his own £2.6million pay packet was ‘very good’, and said he would be tempted to join rival channel ITV only if it offered him a ‘lorry-load of cash’.

Norton has attacked his BBC employers for handing out 'sacks of cash' to departing executives

Earlier this year it emerged that the BBC had paid out £369million in golden goodbyes over eight years, including £60million to senior managers.

Severance payments included £470,000 to former director general George Entwistle after only 54 days in the job and £680,000 to ex-chief operating officer Caroline Thomson.

In an interview with Radio Times, Norton said: ‘They are scoring way too many own goals. There’s a new triumvirate, Charlotte [Moore] is in there [as controller of BBC1], Danny [Cohen] is now head of television and you’ve got [director-general] Tony Hall, and you hope we can start again and that those sort of mistakes won’t continue to be made.

As well as presenting The Graham Norton Show on BBC1 on Fridays, he hosts a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2

‘Because it did seem extraordinary in a time of cuts where you were asking everyone who works for the BBC who’s loyal and doing a good job to tighten their belts and take a reduction in pay, while those people who’d dragged the BBC into disrepute were being handed sacks of cash. It defies belief.’

Last year it emerged that Norton had received £2.61million in ‘presenter fees, production fees and royalties’ from his production firm So Television, an increase of 20 per cent in a year. It is thought his BBC salary accounts for at least £1.5million of that income.

As well as presenting The Graham Norton Show on BBC1 on Fridays, he hosts a Saturday morning show on BBC Radio 2.

The star, who has homes in London, 
New York and Sussex, said: ‘I can’t imagine what would make me [leave 
the BBC]. Who’s to say? Because I don’t think I would work on ITV. So 
the only reason I would go is if I was ready to retire and they had a 
lorry-load of cash outside my door. Then I might.’

Norton
also spoke about a near-fatal stabbing he suffered while a drama 
student. He was left for dead by a gang who stabbed him in the chest 
while he was walking through Queen’s Park in North London and lost more 
than half the blood in his body.

Recalling
the incident, Norton said: ‘You don’t feel pain in that moment because 
your adrenaline’s all pumping. That Shakespearean thing of, “Oh, I’ve 
been run through” I always thought they said because they didn’t have 
any special effects. But they say it because that’s what people say when
they’re run though. They look down and they see blood and they go, “Oh,
I’ve been run through”.

‘I
looked down and went, “Oh, I’ve been stabbed”. Eventually you bleed out
and it’s not an unpleasant feeling. It’s like being tired.’
