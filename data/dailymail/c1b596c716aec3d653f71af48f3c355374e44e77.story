A City banker was killed in a freak accident as he competed in a tough Iron Man triathlon on the French Riviera, an inquest heard.

Rob Evans, 30, had climbed to 4088 ft but fell off his bike after losing control on the fast descent and smashed his head on a rock.

The super-fit amateur athlete died in an air ambulance as he was being flown to hospital near Nice in the South of France.

Mr Evans's devastated girlfriend, Emma Thomson, 31, said they had been talking about getting married when the tragedy happened.

The fatal crash happened in the medieval village of Tourrettes-sur-Loup, inland from Nice, at about 9.15am on June 23 last year.

Mr Evans's father Nigel, a retired solicitor from Wymondham, Norfolk, attended his inquest in Norwich as Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake concluded it was accidental death.

An eye-witness saw Mr Evans swerving repeatedly before he hit the rock.

A report into the smash found that the talented sportsman may have been going too fast and simply lost control of his bike in the cycling section of the gruelling endurance event.

The three winning triathletes held a minute's silence out of respect for Mr Evans on the podium after the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile cycle ride and 26.2-mile Iron Man race.

Miss Thomson, 31, who lived with her Norfolk-born partner in London, has since raised more than £8,000 for the East Anglian Air Ambulance in his memory.

He had registered to compete in a London triathlon and Amsterdam Marathon - and she took part in those in his place and raised funds for the air ambulance.

Miss Thomson, who works as an accountant in London and was not at the inquest, said: 'An air ambulance was there in Rob's time of need in France and the EAAA has become a charity close to my heart.

The Ironman Triathlon in Nice begins with a 2.64 mile swim, followed by a 111 mile bicycle ride and a standard 26 mile marathon run (file picture of the event)

'Despite having a high-flying City job Rob was at heart a Norfolk boy and so it seems right that the charity should be EAAA.'

She said they had been together eight years after meeting in London and were 'talking about marriage'.

'There are no words to describe how much Rob was loved and is missed by us all,' she added.

'When I remember Rob it is always a smiley, happy, laughing Rob that I think of.

'He was an amazing sportsman and triathlete and always gave 110 per cent in everything he took on.

Rob Evans’s death was the latest tragedy to happen at a tough endurance event.

An inquest last year heard how an ‘ultra-fit’ police officer died taking part in his first ever Ironman triathlon in New York.

Andrew Naylor, from Anglesey in North Wales was pulled from the Hudson River during the swimming leg of the 140-mile event.

Andrew Naylor was about an hour into the 2.4 mile swim, the first part of the race, which was due to followed by a 112 mile bike ride, and then a marathon over a 26.2mile course, when he fell ill

A post-mortem examination revealed the father-of-three drowned after a blocked artery caused him to have a heart attack.

Earlier this year Robert Berry collapsed 40 yards from the finishing line of the London Marathon and died after suffering extreme heat stroke.

The 42-year-old, of Reading, succumbed to hyperthermia where the body, unable to regulate its temperature, overheats and starts to shut down.

An inquest heard the father of two had no underlying health problems. 

In October 2012, lawyer Daniel Bagshaw died yards from the finishing line of the Hong Kong triathlon having suffered from what was believed to have been a timebomb heart condition.

The 27-year-old from Accrington, Lancashire, may have suffered an arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.

He had previously completed a number of triathlons, marathons, half marathons, an amateur section of the Tour de France and had climbed Mount Everest.

Coroner Michael Singleton said a post mortem examination was carried out in Hong Kong, which proved inconclusive and Mr Bagshaw’s death was possibly caused by an arrhythmia - an abnormal heart beat and put his death down to sudden adult death. 

In February a talented cross-country skier for Dartmouth College in the US died during an event in Vermont.

Torin Tucker, 20, from Sun Valley, Idaho, was taking part in a 50 kilometer (31 mile) race at the Vermont Carnival in Craftsbury when he collapsed by the 43 kilometer mark.

Attempts to resuscitate him failed and he died at the scene. 

'And Rob had time for everyone.

'The thing I remember most about him is the sheer number of people who came up to me after he died and told me that he was their best friend.'

Mr Evans was born in Norwich and attended Bignold school in the city before going on to Wymondham High School.

He studied at Nottingham University and Imperial College, London.

Mr Evans was working as a vice-president at Bank of America Merrill Lynch when he was killed.
