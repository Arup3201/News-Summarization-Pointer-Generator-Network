With her hand bravely outstretched to halt the massive bulldozer, this picture was taken moments before Daryl Hannah was arrested in northeast Texas on Thursday as she protested an oil pipeline designed to bring crude from Canada to the Gulf Coast.

With no regard for her safety the Kill Bill star stood in front of heavy equipment in an attempt to halt 
construction of the Keystone XL pipeline in 
Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas.

The actress was arrested along with 78-year-old landowner, Eleanor Fairchild for
criminal trespassing and taken to the Wood County Jail, said Paul Bassis, Hannah's manager.

'They've arrested Daryl Hannah and a rural Texas great-grandmother,' he added.

Hannah has long opposed TransCanada's construction of the $7 billion pipeline, which is designed to transport heavy tar-sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Texas' Gulf Coast refineries.

'It is unfortunate Ms. Hannah and other out-of-state activists have chosen to break the law by illegally trespassing on private property,' David Dodson, a spokesman for TransCanada, said in an email. He also said protesters were 'putting their own safety and the safety of others at risk'.

Bassis said he spoke to the actress on Thursday evening and that there was 'a strong indication' that both women would be kept overnight at the local jail.

'The streets of Winnsboro will be much safer tonight now that they've gotten that 78-year-old great grandmother off the streets,' Bassis said.

Hannah - who has starred in dozens of 
movies, including Kill Bill, Thelma and Louise and Splash - also was 
arrested in August 2011 while protesting the pipeline in Washington. She
was one of several hundred prominent scientists and activists arrested 
that month.

They argue the pipeline would be 
unsafe because it would be carrying heavy, acidic crude oil that could 
more easily corrode a metal pipe, which would lead to a spill. They also
say refining the oil would further contaminate the air in a region that
has long struggled with pollution.

TransCanada
says its pipeline would be the safest ever built, and that the crude is
no dirtier than oil currently arriving from Venezuela or parts of 
California.

The issue 
became politically charged when congressional Republicans gave President
Barack Obama 60 days to decide whether TransCanada should be granted 
the necessary permit for the pipeline to cross an international border 
before snaking its way 1,700 miles south to the Texas coast.

Obama, saying his administration did not
have enough time to study the potential environmental impacts, denied 
the permit in January.

Arrested: Landowner Eleanor Fairchild, 78, was also brought to jail with Hannah

However, he encouraged TransCanada to reroute the northern portion of the pipeline to avoid an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska. He also promised to expedite permitting of a southern portion of the pipeline from Cushing, Okla., to the Gulf Coast to relieve a bottleneck at the Cushing refinery.

TransCanada began construction of that portion of the pipeline this summer after receiving the necessary permits. Some Texas landowners, joined by activists from outside the state, have tried through various protests to stop or slow down construction.
