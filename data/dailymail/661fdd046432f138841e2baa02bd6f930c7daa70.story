It was the evening that will forever be remembered as 'Crystanbul.' The collapse from three goals in front with just 11 minutes left that saw Liverpool's title dreams die in a flood of tears.

The sight of their distraught talisman Luis Suarez breaking down on the Selhurst Park pitch and being consoled by captain Steven Gerrard went down in Premier League folklore.

It was so near and yet so far for Brendan Rodgers and his team. They had made it until the penultimate match of the campaign and still had hope, but that was obliterated by the boot of Dwight Gayle and Manchester City lifted the trophy.

Six months on and Liverpool returned to the scene of their nightmare. The home fans were not in a sympathetic mood, chanting '3-0 and you f***ed it up' in the direction of the away section during the first-half.

As if the travelling hordes needed reminding - this venerable old ground will now forever send a shiver down the spine.

The Liverpool team that walked out at Selhurst Park this time was similar in composition and yet much changed in confidence.

Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Glen Johnson, Joe Allen, Gerrard and Raheem Sterling all remained, joined by a quartet of summer recruits and Philippe Coutinho, who came off the bench back in May.

This season's Liverpool have been a pale imitation of the swashbuckling side who challenged for honours last season with such elan and class.

Their mid-table position is testament to that. No performance has matched those against, say, Arsenal (5-1), Manchester United (3-0) and Manchester City (3-2) last season. They have been nowhere near as good.

With Suarez long gone and Daniel Sturridge and Mario Balotelli sidelined, there had been worries about where Liverpool's cutting edge would come from here.

However, a goal inside 90 seconds seemed to put those fears to rest. Adam Lallana pinged an exceptional 50-yard diagonal ball over the top to his former Southampton team-mate Rickie Lambert and the striker, who had got beyond former Red Martin Kelly, finished coolly beneath Julian Speroni.

It was his first goal for the club and an encouraging sign for Rodgers of a striker trying to prove a point. Unfortunately for the Liverpool manager, that would be their brightest moment all afternoon.

Lallana was Liverpool's most impressive player, with every pass he attempted in the first half finding its intended recipient. He maintained the high standards after the break too until he went off for Fabio Borini with 20 minutes left.

But the same could not be said of his team-mates. Palace may be in the relegation zone but they dominated the majority of the match, the pace of their rampaging attacking players causing problems.

Javi Manquillo was tormented by Yannick Bolasie, who beat him on far too many occasions and was permitted to fire in four shots during the first-half.

But his most telling contribution led to Palace's equaliser after 16 minutes. Even more galling for Liverpool was that it was Dwight Gayle, two-goal hero of 'Crystanbul', who scored again.

Liverpool's defence panicked when Bolaise attacked them with speed, cracking his shot against the base of the post. Skrtel was painfully slow to react and Gayle followed it in to finish.

The entire Liverpool back line made just one tackle between them in the opening 45 minutes, a damning statistic that shows how they struggled to contain Palace's pace.

The stats showed how Bolasie continually got the better of Manquillo 

They looked stretched all-too-often and that vulnerability cost them when Joe Ledley scored Palace's second with 12 minutes remaining.

Liverpool had actually been enjoying their best spell of the game but when Bolasie left Dejan Lovren for dead wide right to centre, leaving the unmarked Ledley with a simple finish.

Mile Jedinak's magnificent free-kick shortly afterwards set the seal on a deserved Palace win that underlined just how far Liverpool have regressed.

They dominated possession but looked ineffective with it in advanced areas. The jaw-dropping pace with which they attacked defences last season is absent - Sterling was anonymous all afternoon. 

Allen and Gerrard registered a high percentage of accurate passes but few could be described as threatening to the Palace back-line.

But it is that defensive line that is of greatest concern. The summer signings Lovren and Manquillo don't look comfortable and they were dragged out of shape with regularity and ease by a team second-bottom in the table. 

This was Liverpool's fourth consecutive defeat in all competitions and their slide continues. Just two points now split these two teams.

The famously vocal Palace support serenaded them with 'can we play you every week' towards the close. Anyone would fancy their chances against this Liverpool side at the moment.
