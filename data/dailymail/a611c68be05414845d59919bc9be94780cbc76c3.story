Shocking footage has emerged of what appears to be an alcohol-fuelled rolling brawl through the streets of an Australian town.

The video, which appears to be shot in rural Queensland, begins with four men drinking alcohol out the front of a home, before two of them begin swinging punches at one another in the middle of the road.

A man in a red t-shirt is shown being knocked onto the road several times, only to stand up and continue the brawl.

An grandma then pleads with the men to stop as the scuffle moves into what appears to be her front yard, but instead a number of other brawls erupt between a growing crowd.

At one stage, a man in a red t-shirt is seen pummelling another man who is lying helplessly on the grass.

Another man can be heard laughing at the violent scene and encouraging the fallen man to stand up. 

It is unknown where the video was filmed, but the original Facebook user who posted the video was from Queensland.

The clip has received 1.25 million views since being uploaded on Thursday.
