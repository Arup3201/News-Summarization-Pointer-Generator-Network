Erica Packer spent Mother's Day with former husband James Packer's family, just days after she attended the funeral of billionaire Paul Ramsay with him, fuelling rumours of a possible reunion between the pair.

The 36-year-old former model had lunch on Sunday with James' mother Roslyn, sister Gretel, niece Francesca, and her own daughter Emmanuelle, one, at the swanky Otto Ristorante on Woolloomooloo Wharf in Sydney.

The family lunch comes days after Erica was seen arm-in-arm with James, who was fined $500 for publicly brawling outside his Bondi home with Channel Nine CEO David Gyngell.Scroll down for video

Family love: Erica Packer chose to spend Mother's Day with James' mother Roslyn, his sister Gretel and their niece Francesca Packer, the family enjoyed lunch at Otto Ristorante in Wooloomooloo, Sydney on Sunday

The couple separated in September last year after six years of marriage and Erica currently resides in Los Angeles with the couple's three children –Indigo, five, Jackson, four, and Emmanuelle, one.

It is rumoured that Erica received a divorce settlement of more than $100 million last year.

Despite the separation, Erica told Vogue Australia last year that she is still close to her in-laws: 'Gretel and Ros are amazing women. I really admire and appreciate my in-laws. They are strong, they are there for me, and we are all in regular contact. We are – and remain – a family.'

She flew into Sydney last Thursday with the couple's youngest child, to attend the funeral of healthcare magnate Paul Ramsey on Friday, with James.

The family lunch comes just days after Erica attended a funeral with her  James, which was the first time the couple have been pictured together since their separation

The couple attended the funeral together, flying to Bowral on a private helicopter and sitting next to one another in the St Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in Bowral where the service was held.

It is the first time the couple have been pictured together since their split, and the reunion comes at troubled time for the casino mogul who was photographed brawling his long-time friend on May 4.

It is believed the fight followed a heated text message exchange between the men concerning Mr Packer's fears that a camera crew from the network run by Mr Gyngell was trying to catch him with model Miranda Kerr, whom he is rumoured to be dating.

Mr Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras.

James Packer did not attend the family celebration, which occurred exactly one week after he was photographed brawling with his mate, Channel Nine CEO David Gyngell

On Friday, the pair were given criminal infringement notices for offensive behaviour, a penalty which carries a fine of $500 if it goes uncontested by the recipient.

The case stalled earlier in the week due to the fact neither Mr Packer nor Mr Gyngell lodged an official complaint over the incident, though Mr Gyngell took responsibility for the fight in a statement.

'[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' it said.

At the funeral on Friday, Mr Packer's left eye was still visibly puffy and bruised from the fight.

In an interview with Vogue last year Erica revealed that she was still close with the Packer family, particularly her mother-in-law Ros and sister-in-law Gretel

Rumours of a reconciliation between James and Erica have been circulating since the couple were pictured together at the funeral of billionaire Paul Ramsay on Friday
