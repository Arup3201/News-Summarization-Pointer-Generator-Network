Adam Laxalt entered the national political scene in February 2013 when his mother shockingly revealed that he was the product of an affair she had with a U.S. Senator - a secret she had kept for nearly 35 years. 

Just one year later, he is shaking up Nevada politics - casting aside his label as a 'love child' and capitalizing on his famous name and even more famous political connections.

He may be the illegitimate son of former New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici, but he's also the grandson of Paul Laxalt - a former U.S. Senator for Nevada and a man who was so close to President Ronald Reagan he was called the 'First Friend.'

The 34-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, who served in Iraq, is running for Nevada Attorney General against a heavily-favored opponent - who is himself part of a political dynasty.

And despite the fact that Laxalt has no experience in public office, he's already getting the support of Republican big guns like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and Reagan's close adviser and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, Politico Magazine reports.

Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld gave him a personal check for $5,000.

And Dick Cheney called Laxalt 'courageous,' adding that it should be 'the highest priority' to get him elected.

One prominent Republican told Politico Magazine that Laxalt - a previous unknown in state politics - had built his candidacy almost entirely on the strength of his grandfather's name.

'If his name were Adam Smith, this race would be a total joke,' the source said.

Not everyone in Laxalt's family agrees with his choice to call on his grandfather's political allies - believing he is running on his family name and nothing else

Not everyone in Laxalt's family appreciates him leveraging his grandfather's connections.

Five members of his own family have contributed to Democratic opponent Ross Miller - the current Nevada Secretary of State who is the son of former governor Bob Miller.

'Ross is running on his own record; Adam is running on my father’s name,' Neena Laxalt, one of Adam Laxalt's aunts, told Politico Magazine.

Laxalt's mother Michelle, a prominent Washington lobbyist, shocked political circles in February 2013 when she revealed that she had had an affair with Senator Domenici. 

She was a 24-year-old presidential aide. He was a 50-year-old married politician. They agreed to keep it a secret and for more than 30 years -- well after he left office nobody knew - not even Demenici's wife Nancy or their eight children.

Michelle came finally forward, she said, because she feared a story was about to emerge about the affair.

However, Politico Magazine reports that some political observers wonder whether she was paving the way for her son to enter public life.
