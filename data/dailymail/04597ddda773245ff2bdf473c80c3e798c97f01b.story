Shocking murder: Sally Ann Harrison was killed at her flat in Plymouth while at home with her 21-month-old daughter Isabella

These are the first pictures of murdered 24-year-old Sally Ann Harrison, who was bludgeoned to death while at home with her 21-month-old daughter.

Miss Harrison, from Plymouth, Devon, was battered with a blunt instrument so ferociously that she had to be identified by the tattoos on her body.

Her daughter Isabella was at their ground-floor flat when the brutal murder took place in the early hours of last Thursday.

The youngster was uninjured and is now in the care of relatives.

A 28-year-old man was arrested at the scene and bailed on Saturday afternoon until August 8.

Yesterday friends and family paid tribute to the 'loveable character' who would 'light up the room with her smile'.

Her devastated brother Jareth, 20, told how their mother Sharon, 43, had to identify her daughter after the attack.

Mr Harrison, who is training to be a security guard, said: 'She could not be recognised by face.

'My mum had to identify her through her hands, tattoos on her body, wrists and ankles.

'We hope the person that has done this is brought to justice.

'I loved my sister to bits - I still do. We have had some hard times but we have always got through it.

'It’s hard for the family not knowing exactly what’s happened but we have to think of the positive side - as far as I’m concerned, from now on it’s a celebration of my sister’s life.'

Miss Harrison’s close friend Samm Saint-John, 39, added: 'Sally was a loveable character, she was so friendly. Her smile would light up the room. This has been a shock to all of us.'

The body of the part-time nightclub cashier was found at around 3.15am last Thursday morning.

It is believed she was planning to go out for the evening on Wednesday because she was dressed up.

A Facebook tribute page entitled RIP Sally Harrison was set up on Friday and has already attracted more than 200 members.

One wrote: 'You'll always be here with us in our hearts and memories of the girl who made us all smile just by smiling at us will never fade... sleep tight angel.'

Another added: 'My thoughts go out to sally's family and friend [sic] I'm sorry for your loss the stars will forever shine so bright while she looks down on her loved ones.'

Despite the arrest, detectives said they were keeping an ‘open mind’ and have yet to find the murder weapon.

Detective Inspector Costa Nassaris said: 'This is a terrible crime committed against a young mother.

'Our thoughts are with her family, and in particular with her young daughter at this time.

'This type of crime is thankfully very rare.

'We have dedicated significant resources to this investigation but we also know that the community will want to do all they can to help us find the offender.'
