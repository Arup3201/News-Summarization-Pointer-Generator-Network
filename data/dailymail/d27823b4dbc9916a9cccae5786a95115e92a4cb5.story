Australian cyclist Adam Hansen swapped his water for a well -earned cheeky beer while racing in the Tour of Turkey.

It was a seamless action, when Hansen did the exchange of his water container for a bottle of the cleansing ale with a spectator in last month's eight-day event that winds along the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts finishing in Istanbul.

In a spectacular ‘turning water-into-wine’ moment – Hansen tossed his H20 just in time to snatch the cool brew from a bystander’s hands in one smooth sweep.

Hansen tested out the new hydration option in his bike’s drink holder which fitted the lager bottle quite snugly.

Although Hansen didn’t win the race, he received a roar of cheers from the onlooking crowd who were clearly impressed with the humorous antic.

Conceding to be ‘not the norm Australian,’ Hansen lives in the Czech Republic but races for Belgium team, Lotto-Belisol.
