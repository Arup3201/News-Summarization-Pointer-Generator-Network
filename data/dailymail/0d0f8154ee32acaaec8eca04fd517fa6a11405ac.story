An arctic blast was gathering pace on Monday as plummeting temperatures began to cause problems across the U.S. 

Arctic air was settling into the central states with temperatures expected to be 25 to 45 degrees below average in some places, according to forecasts. 

And with New Year's Eve on Wednesday, weather experts were warning those planning outdoor celebrations to wrap up warmly, as most of the country will experience temperatures below 32F.

Snow was forecast for much of the west of the U.S. including party capital Las Vegas as winter storm Frona set in this week

The west coast of the U.S., including Las Vegas, looked likely to see snow on December 31 as the winter storm set in.

According to the National Weather Service, the Nevada metropolis has between 60 and 70 per cent chance of being coated with at least an inch that day.

Colorado was getting hit by another wave of snow, this time with bitterly cold weather in store.

The snow began falling along the Front Range during the morning rush hour on Monday, leading to accidents on roads already icy from last week's snow. 

A state trooper and Douglas County sheriff's deputy were taken to the hospital to be checked out after a crash on Interstate 25 near Castle Rock.

Colorado Springs and the City of Fountain went on Accident Alert early on Monday morning.

Parts of the northern mountains are expected to get up to 16 inches of new snow.

There were also delays and cancelled flights at Denver International Airport.

Temperatures continued to drop this week as the arctic blast set in across the country ahead of the New Year 

The National Weather Service said an arctic cold front will drop into northeastern and east-central New Mexico on Monday evening, with low clouds and areas of light snow developing late Monday night and strong winds after midnight.

The forecast said strong winds were to continue Tuesday and through Wednesday morning in the middle and lower Rio Grande Valley.

Meanwhile, significant snowfall is possible over much of western and central New Mexico, with likely impacts on travel on New Year's Day.

The weather service says eastern New Mexico near the Texas line could experience freezing rain and sleet on New Year's Eve and Near Year's Day.

Party-goers were urged to wrap up warm as most of the U.S. will be below 32F on New Year's Eve
