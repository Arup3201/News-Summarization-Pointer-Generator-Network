Shopping on Oxford Street could damage your health according to new research by the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust. 

Scientists found that healthy people exposed to the fumes of buses and taxis for just two hours suffered damage to their arteries. 

People with pre-existing respiratory complaints such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema saw their lung capacity reduced after breathing in the toxic traffic fumes. 

Researchers found that standing for two hours on Oxford Street in London could damage your health

Much of the damage is caused by nitrogen dioxide pollution which is produced mainly by diesel vehicles such as London buses and taxi cabs. 

Scientist believe that microscopic carbon particles, produced by diesel vehicles, can pass through the lungs, into the blood, increasing the risk of a heart attack. 

During the summer, researchers from King's College in London discovered that Oxford Street had the world's highest recorded levels of nitrogen dioxide. 

It is believed that the shape of Oxford Street, with tall buildings either side, traps in the deadly fumes.

Rudy Sinharay, who worked on the study, told The Times: 'Airways obstruction and a stiffening of the arteries occurred in both the healthy volunteers and people with lung disease, even after limited exposure to diesel pollution. 

'On the hole, the major health risk is cumulative over a long period of time. Christmas shoppers shouldn't panic, but it would be wise for people with chronic lung or heart disease to check the air pollution forecast and limit their exposure on very polluted days.' 

Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said the study proved the need to reduce traffic pollution in order to protect people's health. 

Last month, the European Court found the UK was in breach of an EU law concerning air pollution in 16 cities. The court warned the government has until January 2015 to act, or face action.

Under existing plans, the worst areas - including London, Birmingham and Leeds - would not meet the pollution limits until 2030, campaigners say.

Britain breached EU targets in 2010 for levels of nitrogen dioxide, a gas particle from car engines and factories which causes breathing and heart problems.

It is still nowhere near adequate levels, and has repeatedly asked to be granted extensions to the EU deadline.

The European court, which is based in Luxembourg, ruled that the UK’s Supreme Court now has jurisdiction over the matter and must order the Government to take action to meet the legal limits in a much shorter time frame.

The Government is also facing a separate £300million fine for failing to meet the EU’s air quality directive on pollution.

Some 16 areas including Greater London, Greater Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and the West Midlands are currently in breach of the targets.

The problem was dramatically illustrated in April when a thick smog enveloped the country, forcing people to stop exercising and schools to keep their children inside.

Environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who brought the case against Defra, the Government’s environment department, said the ruling is likely to mean rolling out London’s planned ‘ultralow emissions zone’ to cities across the country.

The plan, drawn up by Boris Johnson, will mean charging diesel car owners £10 to enter the city centre and scrapping old taxis.

ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews said: ‘Thousands of people die because of air pollution every year. This ruling will save lives by forcing the Government to finally take this issue seriously.’

Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘This European Court of Justice judgement is a damning indictment of the Tory-led Government’s total failure to tackle the UK’s air pollution.

‘Air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities, tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet David Cameron’s government has done nothing to solve the problem.

‘The European Court of Justice has now demanded that the UK take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution.’ 

MP Joan Walley, chair of the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee, added: ‘Ministers have complacently carried on with business as usual and put off serious efforts to deal with the problem for another decade.

‘It is not acceptable for ministers who live in leafy suburbs to tell people living next to busy roads in towns and cities that they have to wait until 2030 to breath clean air.’

A Defra spokesman said: ‘Air quality has improved significantly in recent years and average roadside concentrations of NO2 levels have fallen 15 per cent since 2010.

‘We have built on this by committing £2 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles, green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action.’
