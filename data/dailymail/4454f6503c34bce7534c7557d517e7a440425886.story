This is the moment that a controversial art project which was branded 'Satanic' by a church minister went up in flames.

The intricately hand crafted wooden temple was the product of two years of hard work and planning by renowned American Artist David Best, who is best known for Nevada's annual Burning Man festival. 

The 70ft tower was made by Catholics and Protestants working together in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry and filled with messages written in memory of loved ones who had died.

Ahead of the bonfire Presbyterian minister the Reverend Graeme Orr had said he feared the burning could leave people open to the influence of Satan.

But the artist creator David Best said he believed it would help the bereaved end their pain. 'If this is paganism then I am Donald Duck,' he said. 

Around 60,000 people visited the structure, made of carved plywood and featuring a giant wooden chandelier hanging down from a central spire, before it was torched this evening. 

Members of the public who visited were encouraged to scrawl messages and leave mementos in tribute to lost loved ones. 

Personal notes remembered the victims of tragedy from suicides to a young policewoman killed in a crash to those killed during the 30-year conflict.

Among those who set light to the temple were people whose lives were blighted by the Troubles.

Bonfires have traditionally been a source of division in the city of Londonderry, also referred to as Derry. 

Huge towers made of wooden pallets are set alight every year to celebrate the victory of King William of Orange over Catholic King James in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.

US artist Best decided to turn the tradition on its head - creating a work of art that Catholic and Protestants could work on together and burn in a symbol of peace.

Best has now produced eight temples for the Burning Man Festival, which takes place in the Nevada every August, and each one has had its own name, with 2014's creation named the Temple of Grace.
