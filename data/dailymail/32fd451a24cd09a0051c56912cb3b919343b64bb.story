Cross-Channel ferry passengers are facing severe disruption today due to a French dockers' strike.

Ferry companies operating Dover-Calais services had to cancel some crossings while Kent police put its lorry parking Operation Stack policy into use on the M20 southbound.

Three ferry companies - P&O Ferries, DFDS and MyFerryLink - would normally have use of up to nine berths at Calais but due to today's industrial action, the three companies are having to share just the one berth.

P&O Ferries have confirmed there will be cancellations and that it will be difficult to get day-trippers back

A P&O Ferries spokesman said: 'The three companies would normally operate around 40 sailings a day between Dover and Calais but there will be cancellations today.

'We have told day trippers not to travel. We might be able to get them to France but it could be difficult getting them back. The main problem today is going to be for freight traffic. We understand the industrial action will end at 9pm UK time today.'

Kent Police said Operation Stack phase one was expected to remain for at least the rest of today.

Non-freight traffic is being diverted on to the A20 from junction eight and rejoining the motorway at junction nine. This allows backed-up freight traffic to park on the coastbound carriageway.

Operation Stack is where parts of the M20 are used to queue lorries  to avoid causing gridlock across Kent's road network.

It is only introduced as an emergency measure.

There is a reduced number of berths in operation at Calais owing to strike action, meaning cancellations

The strike action will have a knock-on effect in and out of the Port of Dover and surrounding roads 

The Port of Dover website reported: 'The Port of Dover wishes to advise its customers and the local community that an industrial action in Calais has commenced. 

'There is currently a reduced number of berths available for discharge and loading. This is likely to have adverse impact on ferry services and capacity at the Port of Dover. 

'Customers are strongly advised, where possible, to travel through Dover before midday (12pm) on Friday. The traffic in Dover is currently free flowing with space available at the Port of Dover.'

Travellers took to social networks to voice their anger with the latest round of strikes.

Phil McDermott wrote on Twitter: 'French striking at Calais again been floating outside for an hour going to be another hour before we can land, while Paul Woodbury added: 'Industrial strike action in Calais is taking place. Only one berth available for use by 8 ships. Expect delays.'

Louise Timmons wrote: 'When is strike due to finish. Daughter and school trip currently outside Calais and coming back later today???'
