Family and friends desperately searching for a British father who vanished ten days ago on a stag do in Prague have accused police of not doing enough to find him.

Karl Law, 34, disappeared in the Czech capital on November 15 and friends who were with him said it was a complete mystery what happened to him.

But Prague police have rejected the family's claims, insisting they started the search 24 hours after the man was reported missing.

Missing: Karl Law, 34, a builder from Fareham, Hampshire, in the same clothes he was wearing when he disappeared after getting separated from his cousin's stag do on November 15

Devastated: Karl has missed the birthday of his son, Lenny, three. He has now been missing for ten days 

Prague police even claimed he had been sighted twice on separate occasions a day and two days after he vanished, and that he seemed to be either drunk or on drugs.

The builder, from Fareham, Hampshire, went missing at 11.30pm after becoming separated from a 13-strong stag party in Prague's Old Town Square.

His friends only realised he was missing when they returned to their hotel at 3am on Sunday and discovered that he was not with them. Then when he didn't turn up for their flight home, panic began to set in.

The father-of-one did not have a passport, mobile phone or bank card with him but was carrying around £170 in cash.

He has now missed the birthday of his son Lenny. His fiancee, Amanda Collins, 30, who he's dated for eight years until getting engaged after their son was born, told The Mirror: 'I am just really, really worried. For him to miss our son's birthday is really worrying. I have no idea what could have happened to him. He absolutely doted on Lenny.' 

His family and friends set up a Facebook page on which news and pictures about the search for Karl have been shared.

On Sunday, seven days after the search was launched, the page's creators posted: 'Please keep sharing, we need all the awareness as we can get. Police in Prague just don't want to play ball.'

The wife of one of the stag night revellers, Louise Thorton-Turp who has also been searching for Karl told MailOnline: 'They don't seem to be doing a lot, we have had to hire a private detective as even the local police station didn't appear to know anything about it since we reported it and they have not been helpful at all.

'We feel like we are being left to sort it out ourselves which isn't great as we can't speak Czech.'

But Prague police spokesman Tomas Hulan told MailOnline: 'We reject the claim that Prague policemen are not searching for the missing man and are not co-operating with the family.

'Our investigators have been doing their best to find the 34-year-old man as soon as possible.'

He said they had been working round the clock to try and trace him and that they had confirmed he had been sighted a day later, on November 16, in the city's Palackeho Square and a day after that near the National Theatre. 

He said: 'In both cases he showed obvious signs of drunkenness and some kind of confusion.'

Mr Hulan went on to claim that Czech police had been told by Hampshire police, who have been supporting the hunt, that Karl had been on drugs 'at least one or two days before his vanishing'.

But Karl's brother, Craig, denied he had been taking drugs. When asked about the claims he said: 'This is none of your business. But no, it's not true.'

A Hampshire police spokesman said: 'Our role in this is to support the family and give them as much assistance as possible. Whether he has been taking drugs or not is really not relevant to that role.'

The spokesman added: 'We don't routinely pass on details of what information our detectives have passed on with other police.'

Craig, 30, alerted both the police and the British embassy in Prague and has remained in the Czech capital this week to try and find his brother.

He said: 'We have contacted the police and visited local hospitals but cannot find any trace of him. We have put up posters all over the place appealing for information.

Dismay: Karl's brother Craig, 30, is among a group of family and friends who have stayed in Prague and vow to bring him home. They have now hired a private detective to help with the search

Sick with worry: Karl's fiance, Amanda Collins (pictured with Karl above) said she has no idea what has happened, adding: 'For him to miss our son's birthday is really worrying'

Devoted: Karl's shocked family told the BBC that he 'dotes on his son' and was the 'nicest lad'

'I will stay here as long as it takes to find him. We just want him to make contact with us.' 

Karl flew out to Prague with friends and family to celebrate his cousin Lee Cross's impending wedding. 

His worried cousin and his fiancee Natalie Grainger, 34, have now postponed their wedding until they find Karl, and said it would not be right to celebrate when he was missing.

She said: 'We're all just so worried, I can't get married when I know he's not there. I can't believe he would miss his little boy's birthday, he was telling everyone how excited he was about it.'

Lee, 41, said: 'I couldn't even think about getting married until Karl is found safe and well.'

Craig added that Karl lost his mobile phone on Friday night.

The following evening the group left their Jury's Inn hotel and visited bars in the Old Town Square including one in which they took a group photograph which included Karl.

Shortly afterwards the group split, and eight of them went on to the Maxim Bar nightclub. It was at this point that Karl was last seen, they say. 

Karl has been pictured in Czech national newspapers and TV stations with an appeal for witnesses.

Luke, from Fareham, currently staying in Prague wrote on Facebook: 'Today I was approached by the Police in Prague on my way to work, they were asking about and showing pictures of Karl, there were actually a few of them walking around the Andel area.

'I have spoken to some people who have mentioned that since Karl's disappearance, they have been stopped on multiple occasions by the Czech Police, and have been shown the information about Karl, some of my colleagues were also asked if they had seen him during the weekend and this morning on the way into work.

Postponed: Karl's cousin Lee Cross and fiancee Natalie Grainger have put their wedding on hold

Prague has long been one of the favourite destinations for the British stag do parties who are attracted by the cheap drink, lively nightlife and beautiful women in the Czech capital.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of a British national reported missing in Prague and are providing consular assistance to the family.'
