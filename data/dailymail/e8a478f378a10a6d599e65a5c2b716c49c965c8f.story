Water cannon will be ready for use on the streets of mainland Britain within months under controversial new plans.

London Mayor Boris Johnson wants Britain's biggest police force to be armed with the fearsome weapon by the Summer.

In the wake of the riots of August 2011, Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has been calling for officers to have access to the high-pressured cannon to quell possible future outbreaks of disorder.

Controversial methods:The cannons have never been used on the streets of mainland Britain

But the Home Secretary Theresa May has refused to fund it as a 'national asset' for forces.

Now Boris Johnson is pressing ahead with the scheme, telling the Home Secretary he is happy to fund the machines after receiving assurances from the Met Commissioner that they will be 'rarely used and rarely seen' only in the most extreme circumstances.

Mr Johnson will hold talks with stakeholders, members of the public and the Police and Crime Committee of the London Assembly over the next few weeks before making a final decision next month.

This week Mr Johnson wrote to Mrs May: 'Following briefing by the Commissioner I am broadly convinced of the value of having water cannon available to the Metropolitan Police Service for those circumstances where its absence would lead to either greater disorder or the use of more extreme force.'

He added: 'Subject to the public engagement process that I have outlined above, I am happy to make the necessary funds available to the Metropolitan Police Service for the most economical interim solution that allows the Commissioner to meet his desire to prevent disorder on the streets.'

Scotland Yard wants to take delivery of the cannon, which have never been used on the streets of mainland Britain, by the time of the third anniversary of the riots which laid waste to great swathes of the country.

But the Home Secretary still has to decide whether to licence use of the machines.

There are plans to buy three cannon from Germany at a cost of £30,000 each, that will then need to be modified for use on UK soil.

The Met has approached companies about hiring or buying second-hand water cannons from overseas to have the machines available as soon as possible.

The German-made Ziegler Wasserwerfer 9000 costs £1.3 million from new.

Each machine holds 9,000 litres and is equipped with searchlights and CCTV cameras.

Last year nearly 3,000 British police officers were trained how to work around the cannon before being deployed to Northern Ireland as part of the massive security operation for the G8 summit.

The jets have been used in Northern Ireland for some time, but Sir Hugh Orde, head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has spoken out against water cannon after deploying it while he was Chief of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

The machines have caused serious injuries in the past, including to a German protester who was blinded in 2010.

Yesterday London Assembly member Jenny Jones said: 'What happens if the Commissioner wants to deploy water cannon but the Mayor doesn't? Londoners need to know when and in what circumstances the Mayor would agree with the Met using this weapon.

'Allowing water cannon on the streets of London is a step in the wrong direction towards arming our police like a military force, and it goes against our great tradition of an unarmed police service.

'People have a democratic right to protest and my fear is that once the Mayor allows these weapons onto our streets we will see them being used against people exercising their legal right to protest.'

Stephen Greenhaigh, Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime has now written to the London Assembly saying: 'In order to ensure that water cannon is available by next summer, something which the Commissioner has been calling for, it is important that this process of engagement starts soon.

'This will be based on the reassurance that the Commissioner has given that it will be "rarely used and rarely seen".' A spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office for Policing And Crime (MOPAC) added: 'Since the riots in August 2011 the police and the independent Inspectorate of Constabulary have argued that water cannon should be available as one of a range of tools to respond to serious public disorder.
