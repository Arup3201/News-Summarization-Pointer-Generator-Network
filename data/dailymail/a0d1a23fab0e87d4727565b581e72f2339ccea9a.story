They are heavily armed and known for carrying out dangerous and remote pursuits in night time helicopter raids.

But for the first Navy SEALs that would have been something of a luxury as they landed on beaches in the dark on two-man motorised rafts dubbed 'flying mattresses'.

Often members were only armed with knives and wore nothing but swimming trunks and flippers as they carried out seaborne clandestine missions during the Second World War.

Frank Monteleone, 89, was a member of an elite commando force within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) - the precursor to the CIA.

Created after the United States entered Second World War, the OSS pioneered many of the intelligence-gathering techniques and commando-style tactics used by today's U.S. Special Forces.

The spy agency's Maritime Unit, formed in 1943, shares the credit for setting the foundation for what would become the Navy SEALs, created during the Kennedy administration in 1962.

Head of the OSS, William 'Wild Bill' Donovan - a Wall Street lawyer - recruited yachtsmen, Olympic-calibre swimmers and California's 'beach rats' - lifeguards and surfers. 

The son of Italian immigrants, Mr Monteleone was recruited by the OSS because he spoke fluent Italian and was trained as a Navy radio operator.

He said he went through 'all kinds of training' with the services, including demolition and hand-to-hand combat, but had missed out on parachute training - a must for any OSS operator.

Once in the Mediterranean Theatre of operations, his detachment was assigned to the British Eighth Army.

Mr Monteleone, now a retired tailor living in Staten Island, New York, said: 'When they sent me to the British, they wanted to know if I had jump training. I said no, and they gave it to me right then and there.'

He explained how he conducted dangerous missions nearly the entire length of Italy, from the beaches at Anzio to the Alps, often working with Italian partisans behind the lines. 

Some of the missions entailed landing on beaches at night using the inflated craft that resembled mattresses and were powered by silent electrical motors. 

Mr Monteleone and his Italian comrades named the teardrop-shaped vessel 'tartuga,' which is Italian for turtle.

His story along with others is told in a new book entitled 'First SEALS: The Untold Story of the Forging of America's Most Elite Unit' and reveals what it was like to be a member of the early commando force.

Its release comes as a member of the SEAL team that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 chose to waive his anonymity and went public with his role in taking down the terrorist leader in Pakistan.

Rob O'Neill, a highly-decorated veteran who quit after 16 years service, has chosen to given an interview to Fox News - due to be broadcast later this month.

O'Neill claims to be 'The Shooter' and said he shot him three times 'just for luck'.

The book's author, Patrick K. O'Donnell said he had always wanted to write a book on the early Navy SEALs.

'The bin Laden raid was sort of the culmination of what all these men had built from 1943 to 1945,' he said.

O'Donnell, who has written eight previous books on Second World War military and intelligence history, had met Mr Monteleone 15 years ago while researching a book on the OSS.

Speaking of Mr Monteleone's role in the war, he said: 'The radio operator was the key to the mission. If you could not send and receive information on missions behind the lines, you were dead.' 

Approximately 13,000 people served in the OSS during the war, but only a few hundred were in the Maritime Unit and O'Donnell believes Mr Monteleone may be one of the last still living. 

Another member included in the book is Gordon Soltau, a combat swimmer considered one of the Navy's first 'frogmen.' 

Mr Soltau, who starred for the San Francisco 49ers during the 1950s, died in California at 89 on October 26, just days before the new book was published.
