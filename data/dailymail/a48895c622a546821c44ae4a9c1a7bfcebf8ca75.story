Spiders - more of them and bigger than before - are coming to your home.

New research from the University of Sydney suggests more spiders now prefer urban environments to their natural habitats.

Lizzie Lowe, a PhD student from the University of Sydney, studied spiders in 73 private gardens and compared them to six urban parks

 She found that many species increasingly appear to prefer urban environments to rural areas

PhD student Lizzie Lowe studied spiders in 73 private gardens and compared them to six urban parks, six patches of remnant vegetation and five bushland sites.

Her findings suggest spiders are increasingly opting for domestic locales.

'Over 4500 spiders from 160 species were collected and identified. There were just as many spiders in Sydney backyards as in bushland, and there were more species in patches of bush within the city than in National Parks,' Ms Lowe said.

Ms Lowe's research also indicates spiders in urban areas are growing larger and breeding more than in the past

Another recent study by Lowe suggested spiders are opting for the more affluent suburbs, where they are larger and more fertile than elsewhere.

In a seperate study, Lowe found that urban spiders are also growing larger and breeding more than in the past.

Thankfully, more dangerous breeds of spiders do not appear to be joining the urban migration.

'The only dangerous species of spiders are redbacks and funnel-web, and we aren't seeing a growth in those species in households,' Ms Lowe said.

Ms Lowe is presenting her research at the Ecological Society of Australia conference in Alice Springs.

'I am interested in the wildlife in cities because maintaining biodiversity in urban areas is essential for both the conservation of native species and the wellbeing of people living there,' she said.

Lowe says there were just as many spiders in Sydney backyards as in bush land, and there were more species in patches of bush within the city than in National Parks

The white-tailed spider, native to southern and eastern Australia, is one of the species Lowe examined in her study

Spiders in urban areas are bigger and more sexually active than their country cousins, her research shows

Spiders in the most affluent suburbs are the healthiest of all

Thankfully, the most dangerous species such as redbacks and funnel-webs are still seem to prefer rural environments over the suburbs

The results of Ms Lowe's research will be presented to an Ecological Society of Australia conference this week
