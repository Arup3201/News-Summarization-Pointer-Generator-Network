West Ham have been below par in the Premier League recently, while  Mark Noble has also been struggling to get into the swing of things while playing golf.

Team-mate Carlton Cole posted a Twitter video of the Hammers vice-captain embarrassing himself while trying to pull off a trick shot at what looks like the club's training ground.

With the ball balanced on a pole in the ground, Noble attempts a full blooded baseball swing with his driver but only succeeds in connecting with the pole - much to the amusement of his team-mate.

It appears the tables have been reversed in the laughter stakes since Noble recently revealed that it's normally Cole that has him in hysterics.

Speaking in a Q&A on the club's official website, Noble picked out the former Chelsea striker as his team's biggest prankster.

'Carlton Cole is the funniest, he makes me laugh a lot. I can't say some of the pranks we've been involved with, I'll probably get into trouble.' he said.
