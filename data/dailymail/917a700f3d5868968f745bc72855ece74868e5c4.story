A 26-year-old woman from Tampa Bay, Florida, is battling cancer at the same time as she is coping with her first pregnancy.

Ashley Gayle-Boothe was told the joyous news that she was expecting back in March.

It was particularly unexpected news as doctors had previously told her that she wouldn't be able to conceive because she had endometriosis.

Ashley Gayle-Boothe, 26, from Tampa Bay, Florida, discovered a cancerous lump on her breast just two weeks after being told that she was pregnant

But two weeks later she made another unexpected discovery while applying stretch mark cream to her body.

‘I was just putting the lotion on to prevent stretch marks and stuff and I had felt the lump in my left breast,’ she told ABC ActionNews.

A biopsy revealed she had cancer in her left breast, muscle and lymph nodes.

Ashley’s treatment has so far involved a mastectomy and chemotherapy, which she only agreed to after being reassured that it wouldn't affect her baby.

Ashley will be induced eight weeks early on October 4 to give both her and her son a better shot at avoiding complications

‘Because it didn't pass through the placenta and because the baby's spinal cord and all that was closed,’ she explained.

The cancer means Ashley will be induced eight weeks early on October 4, in order to give both her and the baby son she is expecting a better shot at avoiding complications.

In preparation for the early birth, doctors have been injecting steroids into the baby's lungs to make them stronger so he can breathe on his own.

'I just want him to be okay. I'm not worried about anything else,' she said.

After the birth Ashley faces further surgery and chemotherapy, but has said she is looking forward to watching her son grow and hopes to one day give him a sibling.

'Kicking Cancer for Ashley' is a trust set up to collection donations for Ashley, anyone will to contribute can into a branch of Chase and tell them that they want to make a deposit into the 'Ashley Gayle Boothe benefit trust donation account.'

They're also holding a fundraising event on this coming Saturday.
