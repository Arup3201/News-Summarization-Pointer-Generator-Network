It worked for Dr Dre and Apple, and now 50 Cent has teamed up with Intel to create a range of smart headphones.

Called SMS Audio BioSport In-Ear, the headphones feature sensors that measure the wearer’s heart rate at all times - even when they’re walking or sitting down.

And because they draw energy from the connected phone or MP3 player, the smart gadgets should never need to be charged.

These in-ear phones additionally feature software that changes the pace of music based on the user’s level of activity.

The companies claim that the headphones will deliver the same high-end audio quality seen across the SMS Audio range.

They have an ‘ear-hook design’, are resistant to sweat and water, and will synchronise with RunKeeper app.

The headphones will debut later this year, and will be sold by SMS Audio and branded with rapper Curtis Jackson, also known as 50 Cent. 

All the heart rate information the headphones collect will then be logged and analysed online, and wearers will receive tailored advice to boost fitness or weight loss.

The smart earbud prototypes were originally unveiled by Intel at January’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

‘Intel is focused on driving innovation in the wearable technology segment by partnering with lifestyle brands like SMS Audio that complement our technology and design expertise,’ said Michael Bell, corporate vice president and general manager of the New Devices Group at Intel.

The headphones will debut before the end of the year. They will be sold by SMS Audio and feature rapper 50 Cent's (pictured) branding. The companies claim the headphones will deliver the same high-end audio quality seen across the SMS Audio range

‘With SMS Audio, we will bring smart headphones to market that eliminate the inconvenience of add-on devices with an integrated, one-device fitness accessory offering high-end style and premier sound quality for an exceptional fitness experience. 

The headphones are expected to launch in the fourth quarter of this year, but exact pricing and release dates have not been announced.

Earlier this year, Dr Dre became the world’s first hip-hop billionaire after Apple bought his Beats by Dre headphone business.
