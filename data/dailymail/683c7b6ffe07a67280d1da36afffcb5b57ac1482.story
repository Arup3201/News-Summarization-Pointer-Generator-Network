A Meat Loaf tribute singer is facing bankruptcy after losing a legal battle with the Bat out of Hell star over his website.

Meat Loaf - real name Michael Aday - was awarded $25,000 in damages and $4,769 in costs after a California court ruled that Dean Torkington, 49, a club singer from Burnley, Lancashire, was an online imposter.

Mr
Torkington had toured with his show To Hell And Back: (A Tribute To 
Meat Loaf) for 16 years. But last year he was sued for being an ‘online 
imposter’ by the Californian-based artist.

Writ: Dean Torkington, 49, from Burnley, Lancashire, performing left in 2002, must pay $25,000 to US rocker Meat Loaf, right, after a court ruled he was a 'cybersquatter and online imposter'

The row centred on a website which Mr Torkington used to promote his act.

A judgement issued by the US District Court for the Central District of California found in favour of 65-year-old Mr Aday.

Judge
Michael Fitzgerald ordered him to drop registration and control of the
website and transfer it to Aday and awarded $25,000 in damages and 
$4,769 costs to the Bat Out Of Hell singer.

The
legal proceedings continued despite a personal plea to the star from the tribute act, in which he compared his current predicament to problems in the 
singer’s past.

Mr Torkington, of Ightenhill, Burnley, has extensively toured around Lancashire and further afield during his career.

Mr Torkington (pictured left as Meat Loaf and right off stage) claims the pay-out would bankrupt him and the singer will 'not get a penny out of him'

His next show will be as an Elton John tribute, Captain Fantastic, at The Empire Theatre, Blackburn on Valentine’s Day.

He said: 'He won’t get a penny from me. I’m skint.

'It may mean I won’t be let into the States. That doesn’t bother me as I’ve no plans to go there. 'I used to love him but now I hate him, he’s trying to ruin me.

'I’ve used the domain name since 2000 and always made it clear I was a tribute artist.

'With this and other debts I will have no option but to declare myself bankrupt. I’m having to apply for insolvency.'

The
row with the multi-million selling artist, famous for Dead Ringer For 
Love and I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That), began after a 
2006 show in Liverpool.

Dean
drove to the gig, dressed as his idol in a van spray-painted with Meat 
Loaf images with the website name clearly on display.

After the show he claims he was confronted by the multi-millionaire star.

'When I got backstage I couldn’t believe it,' he said.

'He
went crazy. He said he’d seen my van and wanted it sprayed. He told me I
couldn’t do my act anymore and that he wanted the website.'

A
writ issued by Los Angeles law firm Lavely & Singer, named Mr 
Torkington as a ‘cybersquatter and online imposter’ and applied for 
$100,000 in damages.

Mr Torkington did not travel to California for the court hearing.

He
no longer performs as a Meat Loaf tribute, diversifying his show to 
cover several other artists including Elton John, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith 
and Bruce Springsteen.

He has also shed around 11 stone since 2010.

Mr Torkington said he had not received a reply after making a personal appeal to Meat Loaf about the case.

'I just can’t believe he’s treated me like this,' he said.

'I
wrote to him personally pleading with him to leave me alone. It’s well 
documented that he’s had troubled times with debts and relationship 
problems in the 1970s.

'I asked him for a little kindness and consideration but he just carried on anyway.'

Meat Loaf’s 1977 Bat Out of Hell LP has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.

He recently announced on his website that his ‘Last At Bat’ April and May tour of Britain and Europe will be his last shows.

No representatives for Meat Loaf were available for comment.
