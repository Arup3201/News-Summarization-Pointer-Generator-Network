A judge busted for sending a nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff has defiantly admitted sexting the same snap to a string of other women.

Wade McCree, a specialist in sex misconduct cases on Detroit's 3rd Circuit, nonchalantly batted away claims the seedy semi-naked shower pictures sent by mobile phone was 'totally inappropriate'.

When approached by Fox 2 News, he said: 'Hot dog, yep that's me. I've got no shame in my game. I ain't talking to nobody else's wife. You can almost get that here and now.

Inappropriate: Judge Wade McCree sent this nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff

Nonchalant: Wade McCree, a specialist in sex misconduct cases on Detroit's 3rd Circuit, batted away claims sending a semi-naked shower picture via mobile phone was 'totally inappropriate'

'I've sent that out to other women. There's nothing nude about it. I'm in no more clothes than I'll be at the Y this afternoon when I swim my mile.'

McCree, who's appeared on the channel's Let It Rip show preaching self-respect, has played down the incident.

It is reminiscent of former congressman Anthony Weiner's spectacular fall from grace and a plot-line from new spies-in-the-D.C.-suburbs drama Homeland.

But his seemingly arrogant stance has angered his colleague's husband. The court bailiff's spouse said: 'It's totally inappropriate. It says a lot that he's flawed.

Under fire: Anthony Weiner initially denied the accusations but eventually admitted to sending the pictures

'He's not what he appears to be, at least not to the general public because he has access to kids, he has access to different charitable functions.

'He's been looked upon as some great figure but, as you can see according to the picture, you see what he's really all about.

'What kind of man would send this to a married woman, knowing he's a married man himself?'

Fox 2 legal analyst Charlie Langton claimed McCree would 'probably' now lose his job - in echoes of former Congressman Antony Weiner who was forced to resign in June last year.

He said: 'If you take your cell phone and you send naked pictures to people that's called sexting.

'High school kids do it these days, I wasn't aware that judges do it too. I mean it's borderline criminal... and weird.'

Jokingly, Langton later admitted the judge was 'pretty fit' but then questioned 'what exactly he was fit for'. Weinger quit after it emerged he sent a lewd photograph to a 21-year-old woman in Washington over Twitter.

Although he initially denied the accusations, he eventually admitted to sending the picture - and others before and after his marriage. His wife Huma Abedin, a Hillary Clinton aide, stood by him throughout the scandal.

The scandal recently resurfaced when it was mirrored in Showtime's spy-drama Homeland - where a politician was ousted for also texting nude pictures of himself to young women.

The bailiff's husband said they were now filing a complaint with the prosecutor and the Judicial Tenure Commission.
