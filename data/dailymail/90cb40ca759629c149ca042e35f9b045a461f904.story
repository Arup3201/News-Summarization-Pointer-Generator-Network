After 24 painful years of searching for answers, the families of three murdered Aboriginal children are a step closer to finding justice.

Colleen Walker-Craig, 16, Clinton Speedy-Duroux, 16, and Evelyn Greenup, four, disappeared from the Bowraville community on the NSW north coast over several months from 1990 to 1991.

The bodies of Clinton and Evelyn were found in bushland on the outskirts of the town, while Colleen's body is still missing.

In 1991, local man Jay Hart was charged with the murder of Clinton and Evelyn, but was acquitted of murdering Clinton in 1994.

Shortly afterwards prosecutors also dropped the charges relating to Evelyn.

After an inquest into her death in 2004, Mr Hart was once more charged with Evelyn's murder and again acquitted.

Due to technicalities in NSW legislation, key pieces of evidence were excluded from the trials and the three murders were never considered in a single trial.

After a 12-month investigation, a NSW parliamentary inquiry on Thursday found flaws in the way police investigated the cases.

It also called on the NSW government to look at clarifying laws to allow a single retrial to be held.

Michelle Jarrett, Evelyn's aunt, was in parliament when the report was tabled.

'(I'm) relieved in finally getting the acknowledgment that we weren't lying in how we were being treated,' she said.

'It's really great to be acknowledged ... we need it.'

She said her family was now one step closer to justice.

'The light's getting a bit bigger,' Ms Jarrett said.

Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin has worked on the case since 1996 and says families have been let down by the justice system.

He told the inquiry race had impacted on how the murders were investigated.

Det Insp Jubelin said on Thursday there were overwhelming links between the murders and that they must be heard in a single trial.

Committee chair and Liberal MP David Clarke hoped the recommendations brought the families closer to justice.

'A killer whose crimes constitute evil at its very darkest and most depraved is still free,' he told the chamber.

'Justice demands that the killer of these three children whose lives were brutally cut short before they really ever begun should be brought to account.'

Clinton's sister-in-law Leonie Duroux says the government should apologise to the families over the mishandled murder investigations.

Colleen's brother Lucas Craig was also in parliament.

'It was a very emotional day and a very happy day,' he said.
