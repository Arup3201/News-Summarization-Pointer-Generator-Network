A mother launched an outrageous and crude attack at a cell phone store after she wanted a refund for the phone her son bought.

The woman, identified only as Stephanie, was caught on camera by the shop assistant after she launched into a tirade which ended with her lifting her dress and mooning him last week.

The crude display happened at a Detroit cell phone store after the woman tried to return the phone outside of the refund period.

Crude gesture: A woman, identified only as Stephanie, lifts her dress and moons the store clerk in Detroit after a dispute over a cell phone refund

Unrepentant: The mother later said she was unrepentant because the store had sold her son a broken phone

The clerk told CNN: 'They came in a week ago, I explained them the situation. I showed them everything on the receipt.'

Despite explaining the clear returns policy, the clerk said that the woman went berserk. 

She threw bundles of leaflets all over the store before allegedly stabbing at display cabinets with a knife in a rage.

She then screamed at the store employee to take her picture before yelling: 'You got that? Because I will be back. You got that close up? Cheese!'

The woman explained her actions by saying that the store had sold her son an outdated and damaged phone - but would not replace it or give her the money back.

The store clerk said that no worker should have to endure such displays.

According to the employee, the owner, who lives in Florida, is planning to file charges for damage done to the store.
