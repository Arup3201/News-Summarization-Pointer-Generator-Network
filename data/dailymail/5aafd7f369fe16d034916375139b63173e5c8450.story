Jonathan Trott completed his tour-de-force double-century in England Lions' run-drenched stalemate with South Africa A in the first unofficial Test at Paarl.

Trott (211no) batted almost 11 hours, hitting 17 fours from 403 balls, as his team established a first-innings lead before eventually declaring on 624 for eight in reply 504 for eight in late morning on the fourth and final day.

A fourth career double-hundred was a personal triumph for the painstaking Trott, South Africa-born and back on the ground where he made his first-class debut as a teenager 15 years ago.

His efforts helped the Lions out of a spot of bother too, from 67 for three at one stage, as he and a succession of partners piled on the runs.

James Vince played an important part with the first of five half-centuries from number five downwards, to complement Trott's immovability at number four.

The captain was therefore able to resume on 176 out of a day-three stumps total of 507 for six alongside Liam Plunkett.

The fast bowler duly became the third of four Yorkshire players to pass 50, reaching his milestone before mishooking Chris Morris to long-leg to end a stand of 106.

Young Durham seamer Mark Wood made only five, but number 10 Jack Brooks joined in with a career-best 53 not out - only his second first-class 50, from just 37 balls and containing five fours and two sixes - before Trott called time to see if his bowlers could make any inroads in just over two sessions remaining.

On a stubbornly docile surface, they could not.

Trott made only his fourth career double-hundred in the match against South Africa A

First-innings centurion Gihahn Cloete was undone by marginal low bounce to go lbw to Boyd Rankin, and his fellow opener Stiaan van Zyl was caught behind by Jonny Bairstow off the leg-spin of his Yorkshire team-mate Adil Rashid.

But after the hosts reached 92 for two at tea, Trott and his opposite number Rory Kleinveldt agreed a draw.

The second and final 'Test' will get under way in Bloemfontein on Sunday.
