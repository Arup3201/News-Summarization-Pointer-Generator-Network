Twitter is an unforgivable place at times and that would be to Manchester United's downfall on Monday night as Louis van Gaal and Co were mocked on social media following their FA Cup exit at the hands of Arsenal.

Prior to the game Dutchman Van Gaal labelled Welbeck 'a substitute', resulting in why he was allowed to leave the Old Trafford side for the Emirates in the summer transfer window.

The Manchester-born forward came back to haunt his former side with the winner on Monday, and unsurprisingly he took centre stage on Twitter, in particular.

Below are the best memes from the night...
