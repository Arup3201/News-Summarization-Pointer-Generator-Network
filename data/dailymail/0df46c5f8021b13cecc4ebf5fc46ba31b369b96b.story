An RAF training plane came dangerously close to colliding with a remote controlled aircraft while flying above Cambridgeshire, it has emerged.

The plane came to within just 40ft of the remote-controlled model aircraft, which the report stated may have been flying at 600ft.

A UK Airprox Board report labelled the incident on February 4 2014 as 'high severity' and said the 'safety of the aircraft may have been compromised'.

The trainer, from RAF Wyton near Huntingdon, had to take evasive action when the near-miss happened above the village of Northborough, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

The pilot of the Tutor aircraft was forced to bank hard to the left in order to avoid a collision after it appeared both aircraft were flying at the same height. 

The report stated: 'The differing perceptions of aircraft height from the Tutor pilot and model aircraft operator are fundamental to this incident.

'The model aircraft operator believed that his aircraft was flying considerably lower than seemed to be the case, backed up by the evidence of the Tutor’s height from radar replays.' 

While the report said the local model aircraft flying club had been permitted to use the airspace, the safety board report concluded 'safety margins had been much reduced'. 

The board suggested because nearby RAF Wittering had changed to a non-flying base, users of the airspace had become less aware of dangers. 

It said all operators in the area needed to be alert to each other's activities. The Ministry of Defence said RAF Wittering had since returned to flying status.

Peterborough Area Radio Control Society member Dave Wood said he was familiar with the incident.

'We can only gauge that height that we're flying and we tend not to fly too high anyway. You're not likely to go up too high anyway - but we're bound to keep within 400ft with models that are (under) 7kgs.

'I wasn't the person involved. He reported the incident because he felt it necessary that the full sized aircraft are aware that we are there because we've been there for forty years.'

The club's secretary Paul Holroyd declined to comment, saying that he disputed some of the facts in the report.
