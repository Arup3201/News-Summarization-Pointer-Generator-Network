If you have ever been to a football match, it will come as no surprise to find that fans like to swear.

Researchers looking at fans' tweets during football matches found that around one in 20 tweets about the beautiful game contains some form of profanity.

But perhaps more surprising was that discovery that swearing is usually directed at their own team, rather than match officials or opponents - with Liverpool fans among the worst offenders.

The team of researchers found that roughly one in 20 tweets about football contains a profanity

The study, carried out by RGU's Dr Emma Byrne and Dr David Corney, looked at tweets about English Premier League matches on Saturday afternoons over three consecutive weeks.

They collected an average of just over 125,000 tweets during the allotted analysis period on each match day.

Analysis revealed that almost 6,500 tweets, or just over 5 per cent, contained the two most common swearwords in the English language.

While fans used swear words to express frustration with their team or opponents' foul play, at other times they were used in expressions of celebration or humour.

The research paper concludes: 'Through a careful analysis of a collection of tweets about football that contain swearing, we have shown that bad language is not always negative; that the wider context is often crucial to interpret meaning; and that perhaps counter-intuitively, some of the strongest sentiments expressed are self-critical.'

It goes on: 'We have seen that fans of English Premier League teams often swear about or at their own team, and relatively rarely about an opposing team or match officials.

The team from Robert Gordon University concluded that swearing online is not always negative, and among football fans is often used as a show of passion

'It may be that swearing is being used as a means of demonstrating affiliation to a particular group, or to demonstrate greater passion about their own team and an apparent indifference to all others.'

Reflecting on the research, Dr Byrne said: 'It's no secret that football fans like to swear. But what's surprising is how and why they swear.

'For example, we found that fans are even more likely to swear when something great happens - when their team scores a goal, for example - than they are when something bad occurs.'

One aspect which might surprise the casual fan is the extent to which diehards swear about their own team, researchers said.

'We found that Liverpool fans in particular were fantastic for this.' added Dr Byrne, a supporter of the team herself.

'Even when they've just scored, Liverpool fans always find something to gripe about.'

Fans were also found swearing at their own team more often than match officials, despite controversial decisions (pictured, referee Andre Marriner sends off Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs after mistaking him for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain)

Dr Corney, senior research fellow at RGU's innovation, design and sustainability research institute, said: 'There's a serious side to this research.

'Sentiment mining - the attempt to understand what emotions people are expressing in their online social networks - is huge business.

'Until now, many sentiment miners had taken the rather naive view that swearing is always a sign of anger or frustration.

'Our research shows that this is not the case - that swearing can also be an intensifier that is used at times of elation or excitement.'

The research paper, entitled Sweet FA: sentiment, swearing and soccer, is to be presented next week at a multimedia conference.
