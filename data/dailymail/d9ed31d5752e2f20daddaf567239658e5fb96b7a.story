Harassment: Margaret Harvey with a photo of her late husband Graham at her home in Stoke-on-Trent

A grieving widow who admitted harassing three members of staff at a hospital where her husband died has walked free from court.

Margaret Harvey, 75, bombarded 57-year-old Pauline Crossley - a former legal advisor at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire - with phone calls and even turned up at her home.

She became obsessed with staff at the hospital who she blamed for causing the death of her husband Graham, who died in 2004 aged 66.

Since his death following a heart attack, she has harassed three members of staff - including cardiologist Dr John Davis, who treated Graham.

On one occasion Harvey even armed herself with a wooden meat hammer and travelled 220 miles to Dr Davis’s holiday home in Saltash, Cornwall, where she planned to confront him.

In September 2012, Harvey was jailed for 28 days for bombarding the hospital’s former chief executive Julia Bridgewater with late night nuisance phone calls.

But she was spared jail yesterday when she appeared again at North Staffordshire Magistrates’ Court after pleading guilty to harassing Mrs Crossely. She was given an eight-week prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and a 10-year restraining order.

But Harvey said she will continue her 
campaign to prove her husband was let down - despite numerous 
investigations finding the hospital has no case to answer.

The court heard that after the death, Harvey had numerous ‘dealings’ with Mrs Crossley in 2006.

Suspended: Harvey was spared jail when she appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates' Court

But in October this year Harvey found Mrs
Crossley’s home address and phone number and began to harass her. Giles
Rowdon, prosecuting, said she called the home three times on October 5.

He said: ‘She said, “Will you not help me now you no longer work for the trust, and bring me the records? Will you help me?”

‘When Mrs Crossley said there was nothing she could do the defendant said, “How would you feel if I paid someone to do something to your sons?”’

Mrs Crossley then stopped answering the phone, but Harvey left a voicemail message later that day, and again on October 7, talking about a ‘cover-up’.

She was arrested later that day and admitted in interview that she had been to the house in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, to try and see Mrs Crossley.

Angela Trafford, defending, said: ‘Mrs Harvey is not sorry for trying to get justice for her husband, but she is sorry that she’s caused Mrs Crossley distress.

‘She is not going to stop this fight for justice until she takes her last breath, but she is not going to commit any further offences.’

Death: Graham Harvey suffered a fatal heart attack in 2004 aged 66. Since his death his wife has harassed three members of staff, including cardiologist Dr John Davis, who treated him

Previous case: In September 2012, Harvey was jailed for 28 days for bombarding the hospital's former chief executive Julia Bridgewater (pictured) with late night nuisance phone calls

Harvey is already subject to an indefinite order banning her from contacting Mrs Bridgewater or going near her home.

'How would you feel if I paid someone to do something to your sons?'

What Margaret Harvey told Pauline Crossley in a phone call

She hired a private detective to find Mrs Bridgewater’s telephone number and started repeatedly calling her in November 2011 - despite the fact that Mrs Bridgewater was not working at the hospital at the time of Graham’s death.

Mrs Bridgewater contacted police and had a panic alarm installed at her home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, but the calls continued. Harvey refused to comment outside court.
