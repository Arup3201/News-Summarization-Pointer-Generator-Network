Since he took a chunk out of Michael Bloomberg's finger in 2009, clairvoyant groundhog Chuck has never had the smoothest relationships with New York mayors.

But now mayor-groundhog tensions appear to have taken an even more sinister turn, after it was revealed that  Bill de Blasio could well be responsible for the animal's death.

In February this year, current mayor Mr de Blasio dropped the Staten Island groundhog in front of a crowd of spectators after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of winter.

Sources have suggested that New York mayor could be responsible for the death of groundhog Chuck

In February this year, current mayor Mr de Blasio dropped the Staten Island groundhog in front of a crowd of spectators after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of winter

But what Staten Island Zoo officials kept rather quiet was that just a week after the incident, Chuck died of internal injuries.

According to the New York Post, the zoo - which gets nearly half of its $3.5 million in annual funding from the city - told the staff to keep the mayor's office in the dark about the groundhog's sad death.

In a further twist, it appears that Chuck was not in fact Chuck at all, but was actually a female imposter named Charlotte, sources told the newspaper yesterday.

It is thought that Charlotte was brought in as an emergency measure because the zoo feared the volatile Chuck would bite Mayor de Blasio, as he did Mayor Bloomberg five years ago.

The plot thickens as it appears that Chuck could in fact be stand-in groundhog Charlotte

The zoo does not make public that it has stand-in groundhogs to protect the 'groundhog brand,' insiders said.

The female stand-in was found dead in her enclosure at the Staten Island Zoo on February 9 and a necropsy determined she died from 'acute internal injuries,' sources said.

She had fallen nearly six feet when the mayor lost his grip during the Groundhog Day photo-op exactly seven days earlier. Sources said her injuries were consistent with a fall.

'Chuck and my predecessor didn’t always get along, let’s be honest about that. But I’m hoping we can start a new day, a new relationship here,' Mr de Blasio joked at the time.

'I’m reaching out a hand to chuck and I hope he will consider shaking it rather than doing other things.'

But the mayor had no such luck and the animal wriggled from his hands and leapt to the ground 

'Now Chuck, what about this winter thing, Chuck? We can work something out, can’t we?' the mayor added.

A zoo spokesperson tried to downplay the mayor's role in Chuck/Charlotte's death, saying the animal was examined after the fall and seemed fine.

'It appears unlikely that the animal's death is related to the events on Groundhog Day,' the spokesperson said

Bill de Blasio was hoping to forge a better relationship with groundhog Chuck than his predecessor

Assemblyman Matthew Titone told the New York Post: 'I was told he died of old age, that he went to that big farm in the sky.' 

The mayor's office only heard the news of the groundhog's death when approached by the paper.

'We were unaware that Staten Island Chuck had passed but are sorry to hear of the loss,' said spokesman Phil Walzak.

According to zoo sources, there are plans to pull the same groundhog switch next year by using the groundhog couple's young daughter - also named Charlotte - in the role of Chuck.

Chuck/Charlotte is one of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather, the most famous being Pennsylvania's Punxsutawney Phil.

Legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on February 2, winter will last another month-and-a-half. If he doesn't see it, spring will come early.

The annual event - made world famous by the 1993 Bill Murray comedy 'Groundhog Day' - draws thousands of tourists from as far afield as Australia and Russia.

A version of Punxsutawney Phil has been making weather predictions since 1887, but since the release of the popular movie crowds of up to 30,000 have made their way to Pennsylvania to witness the ceremony.
