Texts sent by the murdered wife of a former NYPD police officer could be used to convict her husband from beyond the grave, it emerged on Monday.

Edwin Coello, 38, who has a record of allegedly abusing women, is on trial at Bronx Supreme Court, New York, accused of beating and strangling his estranged wife and dumping her body in the woods.

Prosecutors say Coello, 41, flew into a violent rage after his wife, Tina Adovasio, 40, told him in text messages she wanted a divorce because she suspected him of cheating.

In one, she told him that if he wanted to 'live his life as a single guy’ he should 'take his s**t' and get out.

The texts were read at a pre-trial hearing on a defence motion to keep the jury from seeing the confrontational texts.

Ms Adovasio, a nurse, vanished March 6, 2011, from her Bronx home.

Her body was found six days later in a wooded area off the Taconic Parkway in Yorktown Heights.

The angry missives about Coello’s alleged cheating were retrieved from Coello’s phone by Detective John Fennelli shortly after the former policeman was arrested at his home, according to the New York Post.

In one, Coello told his suspicious wife that he was having trouble getting home because of flooded highways.

She replied: 'Do you really think I’m stupid to believe highways are flooded after sun out all day. Really?'

Coello ignored her question and asked, 'R U cooking?'

But Adovasio wrote back: '[I] hope you have money saved for your lawyer cause you’ll need it.

'I only have to make a call and you are so pathetic you think I have no where I could go.'

He replies: 'cooking?'

At another point, she wrote: 'Tired of you and your disrespectful ways - can’t stay in this relationship', according to a transcript Det Fennelli read in court.

Coello’s lawyer, Renee Hill, asked Judge Ralph Fabrizio to throw out the text messages and the testimony of former girlfriend Glory Perez, who described the alleged abuse that got him kicked out of the NYPD in 2000.

Ms Hill refused to talk about the evidence until after the judge makes a ruling.

Prosecutors want to introduce a handwritten alibi they say Coello concocted to describe the final moments before his wife’s disappearance.

'Tina was there,' he wrote. 'Spoke with trying to explain [I] am not cheating on her.

'She was very upset with me. She wanted to hit me with right hand. Grabbed it and she started to scream at me that she was leaving and clawed me with left hand. She received a text and left stating something like "it's my turn. See how you like it."'

Coello told police she stormed out of their home after the fight, but his alibi unravelled after security video showed him leaving their apartment building alone carrying a duffel bag.

After he lost his job as a policeman, Coello returned to his old post as a doorman at a luxury Upper East Side building.

His volatile marriage to Ms Adovasio was marred by several incidents of domestic trouble.

In February 2005, Coello pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment after a domestic incident and received a conditional discharge.

In February 2007, he was arrested for an attack that landed her in a hospital. That case was sealed.

In November 2010, police were called to their home after a fight, but no arrests were made.

Ms Adovasio was the mother of Coello’s six-year-old daughter and had three children from a previous marriage.

Coello was placed in protective custody after his arrest last year.
