These are the smiling young girls, shot dead by their mother because she 'couldn't go on' in a devastating murder-suicide on Thursday.

Lisa Chochran killed 11-year-old Alyssa Cochran, her sister Autumn Cochran, 10, and baby Faith Ehlen, aged just 22 months, police said.

All four bodies were found with gunshot wounds to the head outside the St Louis home of her estranged boyfriend, Christopher Ehlen, on Thursday morning.

Tragic: 11-year-old Alyssa Cochran and 10-year-old Autumn Cochran (pictured) were shot dead by their mother

As friends and family grieve the young lives lost details about the troubled mother's mental health have been revealed, including that she had threatened to take her own life 'several times' in the past and was 'unstable'.

Vincent Cochran, father to the two 
older girls, had pleaded with a judge to have the children removed from 
his ex-wife's care, according to his aunt.

But his repeated requests for custody 
were denied, she said, because Mrs Cochran had convinced the judge he 
should only get supervised visits, citing his post-traumatic stress 
disorder from serving in Iraq.

In a request for an order of 
protection from him Mrs Cochran had him of threatening to kill her, 
drinking Jack Daniels while driving their daughters around and abusing 
drugs.

The order was granted. As was one against Christopher Ehlen, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Grim task: Authorities investigate the horrific murder scene as they load one of the bodies onto a truck; a mother and her three young daughters were found dead early on Thursday morning

The night before the killings 32-year-old Mrs Cochran sent out a desperate email  saying that she couldn’t 
bear to go on living, which led police to the conclusion that the tragic
deaths were a murder-suicide.

‘The email begins by saying goodbye, and makes several reference of not being able to go on any longer,’ Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer said.

At one point, Cochran wrote: ‘I can’t go on like this.’

Boyer told MailOnline that deputies were contacted by Ehlen, the estranged boyfriend, around 12:30am this morning at his home near De Soto, about 45 miles south of St. Louis.

He told police officers that he saw 
his ex-girlfriend’s van in the driveway, but she had filed an ex parte 
order on him, claiming that he called her a bully and a 'psycho'.

'He has mental breakdowns every 
couple months and screams at me, calling me names,' she wrote in her 
request for the order. 'Every time he loses his temper it gets worse.'

Sheriff Boyer said: ‘He didn’t want to violate the order, so he left, and called the police.’

An
officer at the scene was about to make a grisly discovery. The sheriff 
continued: ‘(An) officer approached the van, expecting to contact his 
estranged girlfriend.

House of horror: The house belongs to Christopher Ehlen, the estranged boyfriend of Lisa Cochran

Horrific: The local sheriff said this was one of the worse crime scenes he's come across in nearly four decades of working in law inforcement

'A
short distance from the van, found the deceased body of the mother of 
the three children. All had been shot in the head with a shotgun.’

Lisa Cochran was found a short distance away on the porch, with a bullet wound to the head.

The sheriff called it one of the worst crimes he's seen nearly four decades of working in law enforcement.

Officers recovered the shot gun from the porch where they found Cochran, and later said that the young mother had purchased it on August 29 from a Wal-Mart in Arnold.

He said that the shotgun appeared to be new, and still had some of its stickers on it, he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The sheriff added: ‘We’re at the very beginning stages of the investigation. I’m not going to release a whole lot.’
