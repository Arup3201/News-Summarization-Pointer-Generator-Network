Barack Obama has apparently chosen sides in the pitched battle between New York City's mayor and his police commissioner – and Mayor Bill de Blasio came out on the losing end.

The White House said Sunday that the president called New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton – but not de Blasio – during the Obama family's extended Hawaii vacation to offer 'his full support for any possible assistance in the days and weeks ahead.'

The president then left his vacation home to play golf. 

De Blasio and Bratton have been at each other's throats since Saturday's cold-blooded murder of two beat cops in Brooklyn.

The police commissioner blames the mayor for stoking anti-police sentiment in the aftermath of the July 17 choking death of Eric Garner at the hands of a Staten Island patrolman. 

Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, the gunman who killed the officers over the weekend, suggested on his Instagram account that his double-murder was retaliation for the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown, shot to death by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

Both of the dead men were black. Both officers are white.

'I'm putting wings on pigs today,' Brinsley wrote 'They take 1 of ours, let's take 2 of theirs.'

Brinsley killed himself on a subway platform shortly after firing into the closed window of a patrol car, killing officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. 

While the administration was quick to publicize the president's call with Bratton, it has been mum about any de Blasio sightings on his calendar.

The White House has not responded to questions from DailyMail.com about whether Obama has spoken with de Blasio at all since Saturday.

Obama followed his call to Bratton with a shortened round of golf and an afternoon on the beach at Bellows Air Force Base on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

A White House pool reporter described 'a 20-minute drive through scenic lush Oahu countryside ringed by mountains' on the way from the golf course to the Obama family's beach hideaway.

The president's golfing foursome on Sunday included White House Deputy Political Strategy and Outreach Director Joe Paulsen, intellectual property attorney Preston Heard, and longtime friend Bobby Titcomb.

Titcomb attracted unwanted attention in 2011 when he was arrested for soliciting an undercover Honolulu police officer for sex, thinking she was a prostitute, during a sting operation.

He pleaded no contest to the charge and six months later it was removed from his record, according to the terms of a court agreement.

If Obama has actively chosen sides in the Bratton-de Blasio tiff, it would signal a critical loss of support for the embattled mayor.

After the far-left mayor offered support for liberal protesters who disagreed with a grand jury decision to clear the officer who killed Garner, hundreds of New York City police signed petitions circulated by their union that ask de Blasio to stay away from their funerals if they die in the line of duty.

On Saturday, hours after Ramos and Liu were pronounced dead, de Blasio visited the Woodhull Medical Center to pay his respects.

Dozens of police on hand physically turned their backs on him as he walked down a long, cop-lined corridor on his way to meet the fallen officers' families.

Presidents of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the two largest police unions, both participated in the show of disdain.

Bratton, the police commissioner, told NBC's Today show that the display of frustration was the wrong signal to send at the wrong time.

'I don’t think it was appropriate, particularly in that setting, but it’s reflective of the anger of some of them,' he said.

Police unions, however, are united in the full-throated condemnation of the mayor.

'Mayor de Blasio, the blood of these two officers is clearly on your hands,” sergeants association president Ed Mullins said in a statement Saturday night.

'It is your failed policies and actions that enabled this tragedy to occur. I only hope and pray that more of these ambushes and executions do not happen again.'

The president of the patrolman's union, Patrick Lynch, has also issued scathing criticism of de Blasio for failing to offer support to two police lieutenants who were assaulted during protests at the Brooklyn Bridge following the grand jury decision in the Garner case. 

'That blood on the hands starts at the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor,' Lynch said late Saturday. 

'After the funerals, those responsible will be called on the carpet and held accountable.' 

New York Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel slammed the unions in a rare show of anti-labor sentiment from onw of Washington's most liberal lawmakers.  

'They should be conducting interviews, mourning those that they lost and their family, talking about "how do insane people get firearms?" and not criticizing – but seeing how we can stop insane people from getting an opportunity to get firearms to kill anybody,' he said on MSNBC's 'The Rundown.'

'Two human beings were shot dead, we should not be pointing fingers at the mayor of the city of New York.'
