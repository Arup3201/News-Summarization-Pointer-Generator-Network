Murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence was honoured by world-renowned architect David Adjaye last night in a lecture marking 21 years since his death.

Stephen’s ambition was to become an architect before he was stabbed in a racist attack in 1993.

Giving the 14th Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture, Mr Adjaye – a British architect who was awarded an OBE in 2007 – said he was ‘incredibly honoured’ to be appearing in Stephen’s memory.

He talked about his career highlights, which include the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the £160million Moscow School of Management Skolkovo.

He is also acclaimed for his design of the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford, south-east London, which he described as a ‘hugely important project’, designed ‘as a memorial and a place to reflect and remember Stephen’.

The lecture was held in aid of The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, which helps disadvantaged students to pursue a career in architecture.

Stephen’s ambition was to become an architect before he was stabbed in a racist attack in 1993.

Stephen’s mother Baroness Doreen Lawrence, who campaigned for justice for her murdered son, marked the occasion at the Royal Institute of British Architects in Westminster by introducing the charity’s two new career mentoring programmes for young people.

She also praised the recipients of the Trust’s architecture bursary.

One hundred young architects have received a bursary from the Trust since the programme launched 15 years ago, seven of whom have even gone on to launch their own practices.
