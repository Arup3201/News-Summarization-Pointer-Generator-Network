Controversial: The portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Dan Llywelyn Hall was unveiled today at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but it already has its critics

It's a hazard of being one of the most painted women in the  country – artists are always trying to put their stamp on you.

But judging by the reaction to this latest portrait of the Queen, the painter should have aimed for a simple likeness.

For while Dan Llywelyn Hall describes his work as ‘imposing’ and ‘expressionist’, his crueller critics said it resembled a ‘drag impersonator’ of the Queen or her Spitting Image puppet.

The 'Expressionist-style' painting was revealed at the Millennium Stadium - the home of Welsh sport - but was criticised as being a 'hideous cartoon' by the many rugby fans it is there to please.

Artist Dan Llywelyn Hall, the youngest person ever to paint the Queen, said he tried to 'get beyond her public image', but the monarch's 133rd portrait has not been warmly received.

It comes just months after the Duchess of Cambridge’s first official portrait was unveiled and, art critics were, unusually, largely united in their condemnation, calling it: 'Ghastly ... rotten ... an out and out disaster.’

The Queen's new picture will be permanently housed at Wales's national stadium after being painted by the Cardiff born artist.

Hall’s
portraits of First World War veterans Henry Allingham and Harry Patch 
were recently displayed at Windsor Castle and are now a permanent 
feature in the Royal Collection.

This latest portrait was produced 
after Hall attended a sitting with the Queen late last year in the White
Drawing Room at Windsor Castle.

It is described as “an imposing three-quarter study painted on a 5ft by 4ft canvass in an expressionist style.'

But critics have found other ways to describe it.

David Frazier, 38, said: 'I’ve never seen a royal portrait like 
that. It is a shocking portrayal - she looks like a caricature of her 
Spitting Image puppet.'

Martine Thomas, 32, said: “The 
Queen can’t be happy with that - it is shocking', and Steve Beauchamp, 24, said: 'It is a real shocker and a disaster.'

Diversity: The artist's other subjects include First World War veteran Henry Allingham and Amy Winehouse

Happy: Daniel Hall, 32, is the youngest artist to paint a monarch and the 133rd artist to have sat with her, which he says is about getting beyond her public image

As he unveiled it, Welsh First Minister Mr Carwyn Jones had only warm words.

'In 
commissioning a Welsh artist for this work, and providing a permanent 
home at the iconic Millennium Stadium, the WRU are recognising the 
important role they play in our culture and showcasing it to the world,' he said.

'This is a fantastic piece which thousands of people visiting the stadium every year will have the chance to enjoy.'

Hall, 32, is the 133rd artist to have sat with the Queen.

He said the final image is “literally larger than life” - and was “particularly keen to reflect the humanity of his subject.”

'To have been granted a sitting with Queen is an ambition 
fulfilled and it has been an enormous privilege to be asked to create 
this work.

'As anyone who has ever met Her Majesty will know, it is 
simply awe inspiring to be in her presence and I wanted to relay that 
feeling as well as showing the very human side to the Queen’s 
personality.

'The Millennium Stadium is the pulsing heart of Wales 
and is the best possible place to home for the portrait; amongst all the
hopes and dreams of the nation.'

Hall graduated from art school in 2003 and has exhibited in the National Portrait, Saatchi and Mall Galleries since.

He said: 'It’s a very rare opportunity for any artist to take on, but it can also make or break an artist’s career.'
