Gadgets, Google and social sites such as Facebook are leading children to mature much faster than in previous generations. 

The majority of parents in a recent poll admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly, and 77 per cent blamed the web.

They attributed this accelerated maturity, in particular, to peer pressure, the vast amount of information they see online, and social networks.

Parents in a recent poll from London-based security firm Bullguard admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly. More than 2,000 parents with children aged between 8 and 12 were surveyed, and almost 80 per cent blamed smartphones and the vast amounts of information on the web

The polled parents also revealed 70 per cent of their children, aged 12 or under, now search the web unsupervised.

The results come from a survey commissioned by security firm BullGuard.

More than 2,000 parents with children aged between 8 and 12 were asked questions about their children, and their habits and behaviours.

Almost half of the parents said they feel pressured to buy their children the latest gadgets. While 50 per cent let their children use the web unsupervised, and download apps, at the age of 10.

On average, half of parents said they would also be comfortable with a child having a Facebook account by the age of 12.

Tablets are now more important to children than their TVs, with more than one-third of young people aged five to 15 owning their own device.

Around 34 per cent of children in this category own their own tablet, which is up from 19 per cent last year, according to official Ofcom figures.

And six in ten children use a tablet at home - a 50 per cent increase on 2013 - while the number of children with televisions in their rooms has fallen by a third in five years.

Nedko Ivanov, BullGuard’s chief executive said: ‘Children display different levels of maturity and as a rule you can’t always say every child is ready to do this or that by a certain age.

‘All parents will question whether their children are ready to attend a sleepover or catch a bus, but in today’s digital age the use of different types of technology is also something to consider.

The majority of parents who took part in the poll said their children owned a mobile phone, pierced their ears and had a TV in their bedroom at the age of 10.

Getting an iPad, choosing their own clothes and making their own breakfast were also luxuries listed that a typical 10 year old can enjoy.

But catching a bus alone, being allowed to wear make-up and getting an email account comes at the more mature age of 11, the survey found. 

‘Most children will pester their parents and demand the latest gadgets, but it’s important to also take into account whether or not they’re ready for what they might encounter and if they do start using this sort of technology, to make sure they are safe online,’ continued Mr Ivanov. 

Almost half of the parents questioned said they feel pressured to buy their children the latest gadgets. While 50 per cent let their children use the web unsupervised, and download apps, at the age of 10. On average, half of parents would also be comfortable with a child having a Facebook account by the age of 12, too

The study also revealed that 40 per cent of parents find it annoying that celebrities and friends have more influence over their children than they do.

Tony Neate, CEO of Get Safe Online said: ‘Children of today are part of a digital generation, they just do not know any different than to use technology and the internet.

‘However, whilst it may be second nature, it’s important that young people understand the risks and the boundaries they should observe.

‘Part of this is about trust and education. Like learning to ride a bike, or crossing the road, the most effective way to educate children is to start early and empower them to take responsibility for their own safety.

‘For many parents this means educating themselves too so they can feel confident talking to their children about online behaviour and safety.
