Teens are shunning drink and drugs for a healthier lifestyle, figures suggest.

Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic fall in the number of 11 to 15-year-olds who drink, take drugs or smoke, according to new data.

A Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) poll of 7,500 children in England found that in 2012, only two fifths had ever drunk alcohol, compared to 61% in 2002.

Put off: fewer 11 to 15-year-olds drink, take drugs or smoke than 10 years ago, according to new data. Pictured are children drinking alcopops (posed by models)

Only one in five children said they had tired smoking, compared with two in five a decade ago.

And 17% said they had tried drugs, compared with 27% in 2002.

Researchers found that the proportion of high school pupils who have tried drinking or smoking is highest in the north-east of England. But the proportion of youngsters who had tried drugs was highest in southern regions and lower in the north.

'It’s encouraging to see fewer young 
people drinking but overall there remain worrying trends which we need 
to tackle,' said Tom Smith, policy programme manager at charity Alcohol 
Concern.

'Those children who
do drink are drinking more - one in four drinkers consumes over 15 
units per week. In addition, the frequency of spirit consumption among 
girls has doubled since 1990 and they’re now more likely than boys to 
have been drunk in the last four weeks.

'To get to grips with these issues we 
need the Government to introduce a minimum unit price, a targeted 
measure designed to protect the young and which we know saves lives and 
cuts crime.'

Campaigners Deborah Arnott, of health charity ASH, pictured left, says too many children still take up smoking, while Simon Lawton-Smith of the Mental Health Foundation, right, says both parents and children should be educated on the mental effects of drink and drugs

Simon 
Lawton-Smith, head of policy at the Mental Health Foundation, added: 
'Drinking, smoking and taking illicit drugs are all risky behaviours 
that can lead to both physical and mental health problems.

'It’s good news that fewer children are taking these risks, but there’s still a huge job to do. We must continue to educate both parents and children about how substance misuse can negatively impact on their mental health.'

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity ASH, said: 'The continued decline in child smoking shows the importance of having a comprehensive tobacco control strategy.

'Much has been achieved in recent years but still around 200,000 children take up smoking each year. The failure of the Government to bring forward legislation to implement standard packaging was a missed opportunity to significantly reduce the attractiveness of smoking to children.'

Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'Any evidence which suggests that smoking rates are decreasing among children is welcome. However, we mustn’t fool ourselves into believing that we are doing enough to combat the damage that smoking does to children’s health.

'More than 200,000 children start smoking each year and many are still being exposed to second-hand smoke in the confines of a car. Legislation such as compulsory standardised packaging for tobacco products and a ban on smoking in cars when children are present are needed in order to ensure we continue to protect the health of young people.'

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We’re pleased that fewer young people are drinking, smoking and taking drugs.

'Despite clear progress, we know there’s more that can be done to support healthy behaviours in young people, including our plans to challenge alcohol manufacturers and retailers to increase their efforts through the Responsibility Deal; remove displays of cigarettes and tobacco to help young people resist the pressure to start smoking; and continue educating young people about the dangers of drugs through our Frank website and education programmes in schools.'
