With scenes echoing Brett Favre, the NFL's latest will-he, won't-he scenario appears to be over with Peyton Manning set to take a $4million pay cut and remain with the Denver Broncos.

The five-time MVP will make a $15m base salary for the 2015 season -  his 18th in the NFL.

After being plagued with thigh injury down the stretch, the deal will be sealed after the 38-year-old completes a medical, which should happen in the next 24 hours.

After meetings with general manager John Elway, Manning, who turns 39 this month, agreed to the cut in wages with the money to be used on strengthening the Broncos roster. 

Peyton Manning will begin his fourth season in Denver after agreeing to a $4m pay cut

Elway has been aggressive in free agency in the recent past and the Broncos used the franchise tag and $12.823m on wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.

Speaking at last month's combine, Elway addressed Manning's legacy. 

'I do think that the one thing he can add is another Super Bowl championship. I think with where Peyton is, as I told him in our meeting, I said, "You don't have to throw for another yard and you don't need to throw for another touchdown pass because your legacy is going to be one of the all-time greats as it is as we sit here now." Where he can really add to his legacy is to win a Super Bowl. I think that's our goal, as it is for 31 other teams, but we feel like we've got a real good football team and Peyton Manning is the best player for us.'

Following the departure of former head coach John Fox and offensive coordinator Adam Gase to Chicago, Manning will now start afresh with new head coach Gary Kubiak and OC Rick Dennison.
