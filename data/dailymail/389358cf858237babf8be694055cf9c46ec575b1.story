X Factor supremo Simon Cowell has been left baffled after X Factor favorite Ella Henderson's dream of stardom was crushed on Sunday evening, branding her departure 'unbelievable'

Big boss Cowell led the celebrity tweets expressing his disbelief the Grimbsy teenager didn't make the final, with many star fans branding the show a joke.

Even previous winner Steve Brookstein waded into the row saying bosses had turned the show into such a farce they couldn't blame viewers for voting for 'joke acts'.

Tulisa hit out at the public for not voting for the two acts: 'This is exactly when people are voting for the wrong people. These people should be finalists.

'This is ridiculous. My decision is James, even though I love him to death. I shouldn't have to make this decision tonight.'

But on Monday, fans accused Tulisa of getting her just desserts after saving 'joke act' Rylan two weeks ago.

One twitter user snarled: 'Ella going is a form of karma for yourself. That's what u get when u save rylan each time he was in bottom 2!'

Nicole said: 'No matter what happens, tonight is a great tragedy for this show. You two are the most talented to grace this stage. Ella I have no worries about you, but I have to stick with my boy.'

Rylan broke down in uncontrollable tears over his 'guilt' at seeing show favourite Ella Henderson leave the competition on Sunday night.

Appearing on ITV2 spin-off show The Xtra Factor, the 24-year-old Essex boy struggled to speak to hosts Caroline Flack and Olly Murs as he wept over the loss of his 'little sister'.

Speaking to Lorraine, she said: 'I was not shocked at all. I'm just so excited to come away from it. If I look back six to nine weeks ago, like who was Ella Henderson? I've got this amazing platform and I wouldn't have had it without the show.

'I can wait to go on the tour and get back to the piano and in the studio.'

Later on sister show This Morning Ella said: 'I do feel massively gutted, I would've loved to have made it through to the finals... and I think everyone in that situation would.

'But you never know how its going to spin round, that bottom too and and I kind of expecting it.

'I think everybody kind of assumed that I was going to make it to the final but in my head I'm so proud of myself for getting this far, and so much good is going to come off from coming off the back of this show for me and I just want to spur on and go back into my song writing.'

less than favorable morning with Liverpudlian Christopher Maloney
