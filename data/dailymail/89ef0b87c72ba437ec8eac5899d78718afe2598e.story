Nico Rosberg has admitted that he was unhappy Lewis Hamilton refused to move over for him in Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix.

Hamilton, on a different strategy to Rosberg, was told to let his only rival for the World Championship through on two occasions; an order he twice ignored.

Hamilton, who finished third after starting from the pit lane following a fire in qualifying, claimed he was 'very shocked' that Mercedes issued the order. But Rosberg believes his team-mate was wrong to defy the instruction.

Holding station: Lewis Hamilton ignored a direct team order from the pit wall to let Nico Rosberg through

'Lewis didn't let me by although he was ordered to so, so that's obviously not good, and we need to discuss that internally,' said Rosberg.

The German still leads the championship, but he saw his gap reduced to 11 points after Hamilton managed to finish one place higher than pole-sitter Rosberg despite starting from the pits.

Rosberg held a 10-second lead in the opening phase of Sunday's race before a safety car was deployed following Marcus Ericsson's crash in the wet conditions.

Rosberg lost time behind the safety car, which saw Hamilton leapfrog him at the first round of pit-stops. The 29-year-old has since questioned the timing of its deployment.

'The safety car, the way it came out was just wrong I think from the race officials,' added Rosberg. 'They sent it out at the wrong time and I got stuck behind it.

'You are supposed to do this average speed, slow lap but I got stuck behind it. It was slow so all those guys got by me and that is not supposed to be the case, so that was the main problem.'

Rosberg then rued an issue with his brakes which saw him lose two places in the immediate aftermath of the first safety car period.

He was also left disappointed that he failed to pass Hamilton on the final lap despite being presented with an opportunity to pass the Briton after he locked up heading into Turn 2.

'The thing I am most annoyed about is the last lap because I had a little opportunity – just so close but I didn't manage to do it – 30 centimetres missing or something,' he added.

'What he [Hamilton] did was OK, the way he defended, because the guy on the inside it is his corner so the guy on the outside needs to make it far enough in front that the other guy can't push him out and he managed to do that and that is what annoyed me most.'
