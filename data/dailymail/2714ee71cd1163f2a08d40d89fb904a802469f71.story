The Football Association should show its teeth and call up any players wanted by Gareth Southgate at next summer’s Under-21 European Championships, according to Leicester manager Nigel Pearson.

The question has been raised about whether Premier League clubs would let players such as Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley travel to the Czech Republic to boost the squad.

But Pearson, who was Under-21 assistant manager during 2007 and has Liam Moore under his guidance at Leicester, believes the FA could simply apply FIFA rules obligating players to appear for their country.

‘I don't think there is a debate. We have it completely the wrong way round,’ he said. ‘The question that needs to be asked is whether the Football Association invokes the rule it could do. Every other federation does it but unfortunately this country we seem reluctant.

‘That stems from the fact the Football Association don't have the clout other federations have. Clubs basically run football in this country. There has been a shift in power.

‘Ultimately it's whether our federation are able to invoke the clause that's there. They can call them up, every other country does. It's not a blame, I'm stating what the facts are.

‘My interest is the club and I always encourage players to represent their countries. But ultimately my loyalties lie here. I want my players available.

‘I've worked for the FA and it's very frustrating when you can't get your best players. It depends which side of the fence you sit but their are regulations out there and it's up to the authorities to use the power if they've got it.’
