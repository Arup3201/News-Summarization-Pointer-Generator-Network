Alone with Camilla at Birkhall, the home he inherited from his grandmother, Prince Charles was praying that the healing balm of Scotland would work on his wife as it did with him when the Queen Mother died 12 years ago.

It was where he retreated from the world after the unbearable sadness of the Queen Mother’s Westminster Abbey funeral.

And, more importantly, it was where – long before their dream of marriage – the then Camilla Parker Bowles had helped to cajole and ease the Prince of Wales out of the black depression in which he slid after his beloved grandmother’s death.

Comfort: The Prince of Wales will do anything for Camilla as she reels from the shocking death of her brother

Devastated: Her beloved brother, Mark, became something of a father figure in recent years

And for much of yesterday the magic was working as Charles offered succour and comfort to his wife, still reeling from the shocking news of the unexpected and tragic death of her only brother Mark Shand in a bizarre accident in New York.

Utterly bereft at the loss and robbed by distance and the sheer suddenness of his accident from being able to say farewell to the man who had so often rushed to her side in the crises that have punctuated her life, the Duchess of Cornwall was said to be ‘inconsolable’.

Together with her sister Annabel Elliot, Camilla and Mark were united by more than just the bonds of family life that siblings share.

Camilla’s extraordinary elevation from mistress and public pariah to a royal highness and the next Queen in all but name, have at times put unbearable strain on the Shand family.

That they survived such pressures remarkably intact, Camilla has often ascribed to the liberating and impulsive nature of her brother. Where Annabel was competitive and enjoyed what she saw as the reflected royal limelight – and indeed profited from it – Mark shunned it.

‘He was a steadying influence for Camilla and, as the years passed, he became more of a father figure than a brother,’ says a close friend.

Without him the dark days when she was accused of wrecking the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana – and especially the languid manner in which he debunked many of the wilder fantasies weaved about her – would have been near to intolerable.

Her rock: Camilla will be able to lean on Charles to soothe her 'inconsolable sadness' as they retreat to Birkhall

Birkhall, their home on the Balmoral estate, is where they stayed after the death of Charles's grandmother

‘They are a remarkable unit, the Shands,’ says a family friend. ‘They haven’t had the protection of palaces and the privileges of royalty to fall back on or to keep them out of the public eye.’

When Charles’ affair with Camilla was first made public by author Andrew Morton – and then by the execrable ‘Camillagate’ tape – the Prince could hide away while Camilla had the paparazzi camped on her doorstep.

In fact, as I revealed it was the ‘outing’ of Camilla which incensed the prince more than any other aspect of the whole sorry saga of his break-up with Diana – and he held her personally responsible for it.

Diana later told me how, ignoring her own despair at the unravelling of their lives, Charles had pointedly complained about ‘poor Camilla’ being thrust into the spotlight.

The irony remained with Diana for the rest of her life.

Now Charles must stand by his wife, providing the emotional support as she battles despair and misery as he once did.

Ten years after their Windsor wedding, their marriage is more secure than ever

Surprisingly, the omens are good. The prince has been a steadfast and generous supporter to friends in times of trouble.

Lord Brabourne, grandson of Earl Mountbatten, for example, has never forgotten the kindnesses he showed when his five-year-old daughter Leonora died from an aggressive form of kidney cancer more than 20 years ago.

The family had tried to keep Leonora’s illness private, but it became front page news after the prince was pictured embracing Brabourne’s wife Penny under the misleading headline ‘Charles hugs his old flame’.

In fact he had been consoling Penny after she had just told him of Leonora’s illness. Not long afterwards the couple were invited on what was to be Charles and Diana’s final summer holiday, an ill-conceived attempt to resurrect their honeymoon cruise around the Mediterranean.

He showed similar characteristics over the death some years earlier of his friend and former royal equerry Major Hugh Lindsay in a skiing accident in the Swiss alps above Klosters.

An avalanche swept down on the royal party killing Lindsay and leaving the prince’s friend Patty Palmer-Tomkinson critically injured.

Lindsay had not long been married and his widow Sarah was expecting their first child. Charles did not forget his friend and undertook to meet the cost of helping to educate their daughter Alice. He is also her godfather.

Strong: Ten years on from their Windsor wedding, their marriage is stronger than ever

Charles is doing everything for his wife after the loss of the man who made her often absurd royal life bearable

Camilla will now be hoping those princely qualities will be devoted to her. In recent months she had begun finding that her role as a full-time royal, taking on more duties as the Queen reduces her workload, had placed a barrier with her existence beyond palace life.

Her friends found it harder and harder to see her and, according to a close aide, this had made her lonely. ‘It was no criticism of Charles, it was just a fact of life of the system,’ says the friend.

The only people she saw regularly were the family: her children Tom and Laura and her grandchildren, and Annabel and Mark. Annabel and her husband, businessman Simon Elliot, had been an indispensable part of her transition into royal life after Diana’s death in 1997.

It was Annabel’s 50th birthday party at the Ritz hotel in 1999 that was chosen for the prince’s official ‘coming-out’ with Camilla. And ever since, her sister has occupied a central part in her life.

To Camilla, at times of personal 
fragility Mark was a rock. His sense of humour was a relief against the
 absurdities her royal life presented

She and Simon even accompanied Camilla on her honeymoon to Scotland in 2005. Interior designer Annabel, meanwhile, has picked up a number of lucrative contracts refurbishing Duchy of Cornwall properties and sourcing products the prince likes to sell in his Highgrove shop.

Ever since the death of their mother Rosalind at 74 from the bone-wasting disease osteoporosis, Camilla, 67 in July, and Annabel have, understandably, worried about their own health.

Mark, who’d had his own set-backs with hip replacements and the like, had a much more relaxed attitude. After their war hero father Bruce Shand died in 2006, it was Mark who assumed the role of head of the family.

To Camilla, at times of personal fragility he was a rock and his sense of humour was a relief against the absurdities her royal life sometimes presented.

‘You need to remember that there were times when the prospect of life at Charles’s side was not only remote but unwelcoming and Major Shand was someone she could turn to. Mark immediately took on that role.

‘Now there isn’t really anyone. Charles will simply have to make more time for her.’

A friend of the royal family tells me: ‘The Windsors always seem immortal and not only do they have that incredibly strong set of good health genes, but they are to some extent protected from accidents, so in a way this is a wake-up that others are not.

Mark's humour and vibrant attitude was a relief for Camilla, who now needs every inch of Charles's support

The siblings were incredibly close and shared their lives. Here, Mark shows Camilla an elephant sculpture in 2010

‘I do think they have an odd sense, which is perhaps understandable, that they’ll all live forever. That’s why Sophie Wessex’s child-bearing trials were a bit of a shock to them and why when Diana had awful pregnancy sickness, Princess Margaret couldn’t understand it – because she and Lillibet [the Queen] never had it.’

For the prince the peace and serenity of the hills above Balmoral offer the perfect location to mourn. It was to Birkhall that he flew to after his grandmother’s death because it was the one house that held his happiest memories of her.

It was also at Balmoral where he broke the news to William and Harry of the death of Diana and where the two boys were allowed to grieve away from the public gaze as thousands massed for her funeral in London.

But for Camilla, as the reality of the death of a brother she thought of as ‘indestructible’ was sinking in, the urge to do something, anything, was drawing her south to be with her sister and children.

She has become the most valued figure in 
the life of the prince, one who has helped to soften him and soothe away
 those princely anxieties

Last night she was making arrangements to fly back to her other great refuge, Raymill House, her home in Wiltshire, 17 miles from Highgrove.

Charles, says friends, will do ‘whatever she wants’. As one close friend says: ‘He loves her and he is a very kind and caring man. He does feel things keenly and he will be both shaken himself and hate watching her grief.

'So he will have to try and balance all the usual duty stuff with looking after her. Actually he is good at showing loving kindness – much more so than his parents.’

Ten years after their Windsor wedding, their marriage is more secure than ever. In a few short weeks it will be 20 years since Charles’ television confession about his adultery with the then Mrs Parker Bowles, the third person in the Wales’s crowded marriage.

Two decades on the woman once described as the ‘most reviled in the country’ occupies a position of affection with large swathes of the country.

We have come to appreciate the deep and affectionate relationship which exists between her and the Prince of Wales. She has become the most valued figure in the life of the prince, one who has helped to soften him and soothe away those princely anxieties.

Now in the depth of the loss of her brother, it is Charles who must put aside other distractions to be the dependable figure in her life.
