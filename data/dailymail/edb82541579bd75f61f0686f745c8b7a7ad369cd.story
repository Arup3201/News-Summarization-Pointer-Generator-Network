An Indiana lawmaker has admitted he had 'poor judgement' after he was named as the author of graphic texts  to Anthony Weiner's former sexting partner Sydney Leathers under the name 'b***h boy'.

Rep Justin Moed issued an apology after allegedly sending nude photographs of himself and gifts to Leathers, who was tied to a 2013 sexting scandal involving the former New York congressman and mayoral candidate.

Moed, 31, is believed to have communicated under the Twitter account b*tchboy4you, which got in touch with the adult film actress who said she was looking for a 'slave' to 'financially dominate'.

Leathers (above) was previously in the spotlight back in 2011 for a sexting relationship she had with New York congressman and mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner

The legislator for his state's 97th district, whose profile picture on Twitter was of an unidentified man's backside, sent multiple explicit photos to Leathers,according to TheDirty.com.  

The website shows the alleged Moed account sending a picture of a naked man and saying he had sex with him several times.

Content from conversations reported on the website has not been verified. 

Moed kept his communication with Leathers anonymous by never using his actual email, but his identity was revealed when  his name appeared on a gift he sent Leathers from his Amazon account - a Fetish Fantasy Series Pink Leash & Collar.

Another receipt also shows a purchase for Steve Madden heels for the Evansville, Indiana, resident.

The alleged private Twitter conversations between Moed and Leathers show the Democrat referencing Weiner's scandal, saying it got the actress 'a lot of attention probably good and bad.'

Messages also show the man thought to be Moed offering to put his sexting partner up in the 'nicest hotel downtown' in Indianapolis, where the cheapest rooms start at $200 a night.

In a statement to the media yesterday, Moed said he was 'truly sorry I have hurt the ones I love most with my poor judgment. I am committed to rebuilding trust with my family and my community. ... I apologize to my constituents and to everyone I have let down.'

It comes as he is set to be married this September. 

Moed did not directly address the sexting allegations, though his apology followed TheDirty.com report that identified him as the sexting partner of Leathers.

The same site released more alleged graphic sexts they claim came from Moed late Tuesday night.

In an interview with the New York Post last week, Leathers spoke about Moed, who had not yet been named.

'Is he displaying poor judgment by sexting me of all people? Obviously,' she said.

She said that the lawmaker was 'into some really freaky stuff. He wanted to be forced to wear a French maid outfit and clean my house while I degraded him. He wanted to be tied up and left in a closet to watch me have sex with my boyfriend.'

The pair never met in person despite conversations that seem to be arranging meet ups, according to the Post.

Leathers said that the politician was displaying 'poor judgement' by sexting her, a phrase later echoed by Moed himself

Other alleged leaked conversations show the alleged Moed account hoping to paint the porn star's toenails on Valentine's Day or texting Leather when he was on his way to a funeral.

The B*tch Boy Twitter account is no longer visible on the social media site.

Indiana Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma was briefed by staff on the reports Tuesday and called the matter 'an unfortunate situation' according to a House spokeswoman, The Indianapolis Star reported.

Moed is serving his second term in the Indiana House and is a former Indiana House staffer.

 According to his official site, he is 'a graduate of Butler University and homeowner in Garfield Park, Justin Moed was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives on Nov. 6, 2012, with a goal of putting people and solutions first.'

The lawmaker could not be reached for comment beyond what was in his statement. A spokesman for House Democrats declined to comment.

Leathers also has yet to comment following Moed's statement.

In December she posted a message she replied to a question from Moed's alleged Twitter account 'Who's your next politician to seduce?' with the answer 'all of them'.

Weiner's sexting scandal in 2013 is thought to have sunk his bid for New York City Mayor. He resigned from Congress after a similar incident in 2011.
