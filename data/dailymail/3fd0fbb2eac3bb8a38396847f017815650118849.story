This is the cringe-worthy moment former Florida Governor Charlie Crist blundered in on an interview  just as his political rival, Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Canteraas, was accusing him of being willing to betray voters with false promises.

Crist was elected as Republican governor of the sunshine state in 2007, but became an independent in 2010. After his term ended in 2011 he switched sides and is now running for office as a 
Democrat.

Speaking to the media at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches where Crist had just kicked-off his re-election campaign, Lopez-Canteraas was in the middle of a scathing attack on his one-time colleague.

Awkward: Florida's Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Canteraas, grits his teeth as political opponent Charlie Crist walks in at the moment he had been bad-mouthing him in an interview

'Charlie's willing to say whatever 
you want to hear to get elected,' he told the camera, 'But when it comes 
down to the facts, down to the record'.

At this moment, completely unbeknown to Lopez-Canteraas, Crist appears in the background and walks towards the group to say hello.

Lopez-Canteraas continues: 'When it's time to stand up to make a difference, he left.'

When Lopez-Canteraas
 finally notices Crist is there he appears momentarily shocked but manages to
 regain his composure to shake hands with his rival.

Crist declined to respond to a question about Lopez-Cantera's comments about his speech's honesty.

Attack: Lopez-Canteraas had just accused Crist of being willing to say anything to get elected

'He's just gonna get to debate the lieutenant governor candidate,' Crist said. 'Give me Scott.'

Lopez-Cantera said: 'I feel like I'm 
watching a bad political movie. Charlie has become the unpleasant 
stereotype of a politician willing to say anything and do anything to 
further ambitions.'

After
 an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate as a Republican, and then an 
independent, Crist is now considered the front-runner for the Democratic
 gubernatorial nomination.

In his speech to the Forum Vlub, Crist heaped blistering criticism on current Governor Rick Scott faces from his likely opponent, portraying him as an opponent to education and the environment and a man out of touch with average Floridians.

'Gov. Scott has led like this: embrace the ideological fringe, take care of his friends, bully his opponents, hide from the public and the press and run from tough issues,' Crist said.

'He keeps running because the truth means little to Rick Scott because he doesn't have a record to run on, because he knows Floridians don't support him and that his priorities are wrong.'

Crist gave a glimpse of his sometimes disarming friendliness, rising from his seat to applaud Lopez-Cantera when he was introduced, and actually praising him in his speech.

In his 23-minute speech, Crist reached back to familiar jabs at Scott, repeatedly mentioning his wealth and questions about his business past, and going as far to suggest his race against the governor was a battle between good and evil.

Former Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running for the post as a Democrat in 2014, signs a copy of his book before a speaking event Monday.

'There's an old quote, "All that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing,'' he said.

Crist attempted to portray himself as an everyday guy who has 'lived paycheck to paycheck' and still picks up his own dry cleaning, even as he has held high-profile jobs for years and is married to a multi-millionaire.

He earned more applause, though, when he stepped back from his attacks on Scott to offer a litany of plans for the state.

'He calls for civility, yet his entire speech was attacking ... and insulting Gov. Scott,' Lopez-Cantera said. 'It's a lot of empty rhetoric and I've known Charlie for almost 20 years and I've come to expect that from him.'
