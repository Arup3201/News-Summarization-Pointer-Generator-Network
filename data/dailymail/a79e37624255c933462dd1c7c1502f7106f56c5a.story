Almost half of mothers enjoyed giving birth - but 64 per cent of women said it was the most painful experience of their lives, according to a survey.

Asked to recall their pre-birth expectations, the study found 44 per cent of women did not feel anyone had honestly prepared them for giving birth.

But despite this, more than half said they actually enjoyed the experience in the survey of over 1,662 Mumsnet users found.

Meanwhile, just under half would do it differently the next time or not give birth again, and 64 per cent said it was the most physically painful experience of their lives.

A spokeswoman for the website explained the apparent inconsistent figures of 47 per cent saying they enjoyed it and 64 per cent agreeing about the extent of the pain as 'just one of those contradictions of birth'.

The survey found 19 per cent of women were still having sex in their ninth month.

The majority of women - 81 per cent - said images and portrayals of women giving birth in TV and films are normally unrealistic.

Justine Roberts, Mumsnet Founder, said: 'It can be tricky to find unvarnished truth about what giving birth is actually like.

'We’re either presented with a soft-focus vision of loveliness with the mum-to-be barely breaking out in sweat, or we’re scared half to death with tales of surgery, emergency and ruthless pain.'
