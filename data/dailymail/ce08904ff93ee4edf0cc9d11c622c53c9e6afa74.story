Disability benefit claimants in Scotland soak up over a fifth more in handouts than their counterparts in England, an analysis found yesterday.

It said the cost to taxpayers of disability benefits paid north of the border amounts to £593 for every person in Scotland – while in England the figure is £461.

The breakdown by the country’s most respected economic think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said one reason may be that Scots are more likely to claim disability benefits than people in England.

Other reasons may be that Scots suffer from greater ill health and disability, or that assessments meant to weed out those who are fit to work may be less strict than in the rest of the country. It may also be that there are more benefit cheats in Scotland, the report said.

The IFS analysis, prepared as advice for Scottish voters in advance of next year’s independence referendum, said spending on benefits is likely to rise faster in Scotland than the rest of the country.

‘Funding the benefits system in the decades ahead may prove somewhat more burdensome for an independent Scotland,’ it warned.

Spending on disability benefits is relatively higher in Scotland and spending on housing benefit lower, while Scotland's older population leads to relatively less being spent on child-related benefits and more on pensioners

The research, funded by the Government’s Economic and Social Research Council, said overall benefit costs in Scotland were £17.2billion in the financial year 2011/12, 30 per cent of all taxpayer spending in Scotland.

This came to £3,238 for every individual, 2 per cent higher than the £3,176 for the rest of Britain. The gap has narrowed in recent years, the IFS said.

But the picture is skewed because high spending on social housing in Scotland means low rents for tenants, and so claims for Housing Benefit are much lower than in the rest of the country.

If public spending on housing is taken into account, the real cost to taxpayers of subsidising housing in Scotland is £597 for every person in the population, compared to £493 in England and £471 in Wales.

Disability benefits are 23 per cent higher for every individual than in England.

The IFS paper said an independent Scotland could push through radical reforms of its own benefit system.

But it warned: ‘Any major redesign of the system would either require Scotland to spend rather more on benefits than is spent now or else create large numbers of losers, who will typically have fairly low incomes.’

IFS economist David Phillips, the author of the report, said: ‘Overall benefit spending per person is similar in Scotland to the rest of Great Britain.

‘But within this there are considerable differences: Spending on disability benefits is relatively higher in Scotland and spending on housing benefit lower, while Scotland’s older population leads to relatively less being spent on child-related benefits and more on pensioners.

‘Independence ... would provide Scotland with an opportunity to design its own benefits system. It would also need to adapt it to the fact that Scotland’s population is projected to age faster than the rest of the UK.’
