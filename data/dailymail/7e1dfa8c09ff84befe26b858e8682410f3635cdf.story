You've no doubt seen countless images of the universe, complete with rainbow-coloured galaxies and nebulae.

But do these breathtaking cosmic entities really exist as they are presented? The simple answer is 'no'.

Images of objects deep in space are more often than not subjected to a great deal of processing to transform what looks like a featureless night sky to the naked eye into a explosion of hues.

Amateur astronomer Richard Bloch revealed the techniques used in a YouTube video, using an image of the Rosette Nebula.

There's a nebula in this image - but you'd be forgiven for not being able to see it. An amateur astronomer has explained in a video how Nasa enhances images of space to reveal features and details that would otherwise be hidden to the human eye. For example, some colours can highlight certain gases and elements

The image above may just look like a generic snapshot of the night sky, but hidden in the data is in fact an enormous nebula spanning most of the picture, as revealed in the video. 

Indeed, if you were able to travel to the nebula, you may be disappointed. None of the gases would be visible to the naked human eye.

The features made of dust and gas, as shown in the processed images, are actually there – but the human eye is simply not sensitive to the wavelengths of light they emit. 

Only through manipulating the image can an invisible nebula's features be revealed - a 'trick' Nasa employs to enhance its images of the cosmos.

Mr Bloch explained the methods that take place to reveal hidden cosmic features, with colours highlighting some of the details and features that would otherwise be invisible to us. 

That's because our eyes are limited in the wavelengths they can see; we are only sensitive to visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum.

Telescopes and cameras are more advanced, though, and they can be used to reveal light in other wavelengths, from X-rays to infrared. 

In his video, Mr Bloch collected data from the Rosetta Nebula on 1 December 2014 from the Torrance Barrens Dark Sky Preserve in Ontario, Canada.

He took the image using a Canon T3i camera attached to a telescope, and creating the image using PixInsight 1.8. 

The video begins with a very ordinary-looking shot of the night sky, complete with thousands of stars, and no discernible nebula in the image.

But a method called ‘stretching’ then reveals the nebula hidden in the darkest parts of the image.

- To depict how an object might look to us if our eyes were as powerful as Hubble.

- To visualise features of an object that would ordinarily be invisible to the human eye.

- To bring out an object's subtle details.

On Reddit, Mr Bloch explained what this process entails.

He said if each pixel was said to have a value from 0 to 255, the entire nebula would be in the region 0 to 50 - not visible to the human eye.

‘Stretching is taking that 0 to 50 and mapping it across 0 to 255 so that the bright parts of the nebula are the bright parts of the image,’ he said.

After stretching the image, he performs some 'noise reduction' to rid the image of superfluous data and then adds some colour to the image, with different colours corresponding to different gases and elements.

He then reduces the sizes of some of the stars so they don’t block the view of the nebula, before improving the contrast and creating the final image.

One of Nasa's most famous images is the Eagle Nebula. On the left is one of three black and white images that were combined to create the final colour version on the right

The Hubble Space Telescope, pictured, uses electronic detectors rather than film like a regular camera to take images of the universe, so data on the images is added after they have been 'taken'

The technique he described is very similar to how Nasa makes its own amazing images.

As explained by Nasa, Hubble records light from the universe with electronic detectors, rather than a film like a regular camera.

The colour is then added at a later date.

‘The colours in Hubble images, which are assigned for various reasons, aren't always what we'd see if we were able to visit the imaged objects in a spacecraft,’ Nasa said on their Hubble website.

‘We often use colour as a tool, whether it is to enhance an object's detail or to visualise what ordinarily could never be seen by the human eye.’
