Celebrity DJ Dave Lee Travis is selling up his luxury million pound home, ahead of going on trial for sex offences.

The former Radio 1 star and his wife have lived at opulent Haselden House in a pretty Home Counties village for more than a decade.

Travis is due to go on trial in January after pleading not guilty to 14 charges of sexual assault and a further count of sexual assault by touching, following an investigation under Operation Yewtree.

On the market: DJ Dave Lee Travis is selling up his luxury million pound home in Mentmore, Leighton Buzzard

The five bedroomed property in historic 
Mentmore in Buckinghamshire, is worth £1.19 million and enjoys stunning 
views across open countryside.

Mentmore was mentioned in the Domesday Book and DLT's home is only a few hundred yards from a mansion owned by the Rothschilds.

Charges: Lee Travis has pleaded not guilty to 14 charges of 
indecent assault and a further count of sexual assault by touching

The village retains much of its Victorian history and has a 14th century parish church.

TV viewers have grown accustomed to watching the 68-year-old celebrity leave the property and stroll down a path to a five-barred gate from where he has regularly protested his innocence to waiting newsmen.

At the centre of the village is Mentmore Towers which has featured in numerous major movies.

Mentmore Towers also became the headquarters for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's educational charity, the Maharishi Foundation, in 1978.

As
of 1997 the Natural Law Party also rented rooms there. The building was
put up for sale in 1997 but didn't change owners until 1999 when it was
purchased by investor Simon Halabi.

Travis
and his spouse are understood to be moving to a smaller property close 
by, ahead of his Southwark Crown Court trial in January.

He is expected to plead not guilty to 14 charges of indecent assault and a further count of sexual assault by touching.

The alleged offences, dating from January 1976 to November 2008, are said to involve 10 women and a 15-year-old girl.

While one of his bail conditions was to live in Mentmore, it would be a formality for him to alert police to any new address.

He
will face the court on the same day - January 14th - as veteran 
Coronation Street star Bill Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in the soap and
faces trial at Preston Crown Court after pleading not guilty to two 
charges of raping a 15
tear-old girl and indecently assaulting four others aged 11-16.

Travis was first charged 16 months 
ago as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation set up in the
wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The
probe has three strands - offences committed by Savile, offences 
committed by Savile and others and offences allegedly committed by 
suspects unconnected with him. Travis falls under the third category.

Other
high profile figures charged following the investigation include PR 
guru Max Clifford, aged 70, who denies 11 counts of indecent assault 
covering an 18 year period, and Rolf Harris, aged 83 years, who is set 
to stand trial in April charged with indecently assaulting two teenage 
girls and creating indecent images of children, claims the veteran 
entertainer strenuously denies.
