Busted: David Roberts falsely claimed more than £18,000 in disability benefits before he was caught working as a judo instructor

A man who falsely claimed more than £18,000 in disability benefits was caught out working as a judo instructor.

David Roberts received the highest rate of mobility-based disability allowance after claiming he had crippling back pain, was practically wheelchair-bound and could not wash himself, shower or go to the toilet unaided.

But the 47-year-old was filmed in an undercover sting operation by the Department of Work and Pensions working as a judo sensei, hurling a student across a practice mat.

Roberts, a fifth-dan black belt, pleaded guilty to dishonestly failing to disclose information at Warrington Crown Court.

He was given a six month sentence, suspended for a year, and ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work.

Warrington
 Crown Court heard how Roberts claimed he was crippled by a bad back and
 arthritis in his legs which left him in constant pain.

But
 while claiming benefits he was also teaching judo to classes in Runcorn
 and Frodsham, Cheshire, at the Go Dojo Judo school he established in 
2002.

The DWP undercover 
surveillance team filmed him carrying heavy loads from his car, as well 
as training with students by repeatedly throwing them to the ground.

Sarah Griffin, prosecuting, said: 
'During his claim he was observed by officers walking significant 
distances, carrying heavy equipment, teaching children and could clearly
 stand up without difficulty.

'He
 was interviewed by police and denied any change to his condition before
 he was shown evidence including video, photos and a print out from a 
website naming him as an instructor.'

The
 court heard that Roberts, of Widnes, Cheshire, was overpaid £18,142.08 
but has been paying the cash back and now owes more than £16,000.

Michael Scholes, defending, said Roberts had some medical difficulties originally which were exaggerated.

Roberts had falsely claimed more than £18,000 in disability living allowance when DWP investigators filmed him teaching judo

David Roberts claimed he couldn't walk, shower or use the toilet unaided because he was in too much pain

He said: 'The defendant was not paid to work as a judo instructor, it was a voluntary position.

'He is a highly-qualified teacher and it was a community-based organisation in Runcorn he was responsible for.

'The offence was triggered by the breakdown of his first marriage as he was left with a huge amount of debt.'

Judge Simon Killeen told Roberts: 'What you did has a domino effect on others who are making a legitimate claim.'

A
 spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Roberts 
claimed to have a bad back, arthritis in his right knee and left leg, 
and that walking was very slow and he was in constant pain.

DWP investigators also filmed Roberts carrying heavy loads to his car

Roberts, filmed being active despite claiming he had crippling back pain, was given a six-month suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work

Roberts was overpaid £18,142.08 but has been paying the cash back and now owes more than £16,000

'He said he had pads in his shoes to support his knees and legs, and he would fall without support and regular painkillers.

'This was all a lie. We caught him bang to rights actively teaching a judo class.'

On his website, Roberts claims to be a Sensei of Judo with more than 25 years' worth of experience.

He has been teaching judo for 18 years at a number of different clubs.

In 2009, he told his local newspaper: 'It is my belief that it is important for children to do an activity outside of school to have fun and give them a chance to make new friends and also to be part of a team.

'Judo fits all of these, it is a brilliant form of exercise, it also gives you the knowledge and confidence to walk away from any situation.'

Lord Freud, the Minister for Welfare Reform, said: 'We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them.

'Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable.

'It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it by catching criminals at the front line and making sure our reforms make the benefit system less open to abuse.'
