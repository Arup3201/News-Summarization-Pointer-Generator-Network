In their first major interview since the shock suicide of Simone Battle last year, members of all-female band G.R.L. say they still haven't come to terms with the vivacious singer taking her own life.

Battle, 25, who shot to fame on The X Factor UK in 2011 before landing a spot in G.R.L. - a reboot of The Pussycat Dolls - had not shown any major signs of depression or cause for concern when she hanged herself in the closet of her West Hollywood apartment on September 5. 

'You can never prepare yourself for something like this, ever,' group member Lauren Bennett told PEOPLE.

'We'd just been in rehearsals the day before, learning choreography for our show, and the next day we were starting the morning as usual when we got the call.'

'I still can't believe it. 

'I don't think any of us can. 

'It's weird that we're even sitting here, talking about it.'

The band has spent the past four months in therapy, both individually and together.

Fellow member Paula Van Oppen, 25, said that time has allowed them to regroup and process what happened to Battle.

'She was such a strong woman, and very independent, and we had no idea what she was going through, or her pain,' Van Oppen says. 

'We admire how prideful she was, but now we just wish she'd let us in a little bit so maybe we could have helped her. 

'Now we want to spread that message that it's okay to talk about, and help people, maybe even change the world.'

G.R.L. today launched their new single, Lighthouse, in tribute of Battle, who features throughout the video via home movies from when she was a child and recent footage from her time with the band.

Dedication: The song, released Thursday, is in honor of fallen member Simone Battle

The song is about being there for your friends, Emmalyn Estrada, 22, said.

'Right now we're focused on the song and the positive message overall, about being together in hard times,' she told the magazine.

'We're taking everything else one day at a time.'

Bennett added the group will never forget Battle.

'She'll always be part of this group,' Bennett said.

Following Battles death, TMZ reported that she was 'depressed over money issues'.

Her family said they didn't understand her money struggles because she was enjoying success with the girl group, including a collaboration with Pitbull, and had just finished a tour overseas at the time. 

Loss: Simone Battle, 25, took her life in her Hollywood home, reportedly after struggling with money woes.  Her breakout was in 2011's X Factor, right, where she made the final 17

The family also reportedly told police that Battle had been worried she would never make it big.

Battle, who was a finalist on the X Factor in 2011, was last seen alive at 3.45am on the day she died, according to Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter.

Her father Anthony Battle found her body about four hours later.

He said his daughter had never showed any sign of depression, and said that they texted every day. 

'She will be greatly missed and loved,' her father told MailOnline.

'She was an exuberant person and a very loved person.'

Battle first started singing professionally after her breakout on the U.S. version of the X Factor in 2011. She made it to the top 17 and was mentored by judge Simon Cowell. 

At the time of her death, Battle was in the girl group G.R.L., which was initially organized as a re-boot of The Pussycat Dolls. But they decided to go by a new name.

The remaining members issued a statement about her death on Saturday via Twitter. 

'Words cannot express the depth of our loss,' they wrote. 'Simone's incredible talent was only surpassed by the size of her heart. We will carry her memory with us in everything we do.'  

Battle's record company and management issued a joint statement on her passing.

'Simone was an exceptional young talent and human being, and we are all devastated to learn of her passing. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones at this time.'

Simon Cowell, her X Factor mentor, added on Twitter: 'I am so sad to hear about the news Simone Battle has passed away. She was such a fun nice person. It's such a loss. Rest in peace Simone.'
