Federal member for parliament Michael Danby stumped his social media followers on Monday by Tweeting a number of cat pictures.

The Labor federal member for Melbourne Ports posted ten consecutive cat memes to his Twitter page at about 1pm with no captions or explanations.

While initially sparking rumours that Mr Danby's account had been hacked by a humourless Twitter troll, a spokesperson from his office soon revealed that the MP was himself responsible for the tirade of cat memes.

The pictures offered no captions or explanations and sparked rumours that the MP's account had been hacked

'He's aware, it's deliberate,' Mr Danby's spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'Mr Danby has a very keen and quirky sense of humour.

'He just found them quite funny and he wanted to put them on his Twitter and share them with his friends and followers.'

While most of the images are memes and show various cats using electronics, one of the images posted by Mr Danby simply shows a number of cats and dogs wearing 3D glasses while watching a movie in a cinema.

The jokes were clearly appreciated by some of the Labor member's fans, with some of the pictures receiving up to 30 retweets.

Mr Danby's has only once subtly revealed his fondness for felines in the past, through a picture protesting the Abbott government's proposal to raise higher education costs.

An avid Tweeter, the MP is fond of sharing a mixture of both serious news related Tweets as well as jokes and political cartoons.

The only other tell-tale sign of his love for animals came one week before Mr Danby posted his virtual cat shrine, when he Tweeted an image of a dugong while referring to liberal politician Greg Hunt.
