Teachers at a secondary school who posted a Gangnam Style parody on YouTube have been slammed for undermining pupils' respect for them.

Staff at Mount Carmel RC in Accrington, Lancashire, including head teacher Xavier Bowers, appear in the spoof video dancing and singing and at one point dressed only in towels.

The clip - which has been watched more than 3,000 times - has been criticised by local councillor Peter Britcliffe, who is concerned at the kind of message it will send out.

Tory councillor Peter Britcliffe says the video may undermine pupils' respect for staff

Head teacher Xavier Bowers has insisted the video has had 'an overwhelming good response'

The Tory politician said: 'I am not a 
killjoy but I have looked at the piece, which is being discussed all over Accrington. It is the talk of the town's young people.

'Having
viewed it myself, while most of it is just good fun, there are parts of
it certainly that might not improve the respect there should be between
teachers and pupils.'

Teachers, cleaners and receptionists at the Accrington school are shown dancing the trademark gallop throughout the corridors.

Staff also stop staged teachers' meetings and surprise children in classrooms.

They can be seen dancing in the school minibus, in the sports changing rooms wearing strategically-placed towels, and in the school's reception galloping while throwing imaginary lassoes into the air.

Even a biology class skeleton is seen to try the Gangnam moves.

The YouTube video, named Gangnam Final, carries the message: 'You will never see our staff in the same light again!'

The climax of the video sees staff gathering to dance together in the school gym.

Other spoofs of Gangnam style have been posted by pupils at Eton and soldiers in Afghanistan

The video has been viewed more than 3,000 times and carries the message 'you will never view our staff in the same light again'

Mr
Bowers said: 'As far as Mr Britcliffe's comment, I can assure him that 
this kind of thing strengthens the relationship between teachers, pupils
and parents who have given us an overwhelmingly good response.

'This is a spoof, like the one done by soldiers serving in Afghanistan.'

The video has attracted several comments on the schoolâ€™s official Facebook page.

One
mother said it was 'hilarious' but added: 'How will I keep a straight 
face on parents evening?', while a pupil noted: 'I will never look at my
teachers the same again.'

Monsignor Daly, a school governor, said: 'It is just a harmless bit of fun.'
