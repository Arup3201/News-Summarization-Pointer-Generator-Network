Evidence: There is enough evidence for James Holmes to face trial on charges that he killed 12 people and injured 70 others in a Colorado cinema

A judge ruled that there was enough evidence for James Holmes to face trial on charges that he killed 12 people and injured 70 others in a Colorado cinema last summer.

Judge William Sylvester said prosecutors have established probable cause to proceed with 166 felony counts, including murder and attempted murder.

Holmes is due to be arraigned today, but his defence lawyers filed papers saying he is not ready to enter a plea.

They are likely to appear in court today to ask for the arraignment to be delayed.

Defence lawyers did not explain why they are not ready for arraignment.

Their filing also objected to media requests to bring cameras into the courtroom.

Other than during his brief initial appearance in July, cameras have been barred from court during Holmes' case.

Mr Sylvester's ruling came after a three-day hearing earlier this week, in which prosecutors laid out their case against Holmes, 25.

A succession of police and federal agents testified that Holmes spent weeks amassing guns and ammunition, concocted explosives to booby-trap his apartment and scouted the cinema where he would allegedly unleash a horrific attack on hundreds of terrified people.

On Monday,
the first responders to arrive after Holmes waged the shooting rampage 
gave harrowing accounts of the massacre in court.

The first to speak was Officer Jason Oviatt from the Aurora, Colorado Police Department.

He
was the one who ordered Holmes onto the ground and handcuffed him after
he spotted the alleged shooter 'just standing there' in full swat gear.

Officer Oviatt said: 'He seemed very detached from it all. Very, very relaxed,' according to NBC.

Oviatt was among several officers who spoke in court on the first day of pre-trial hearings for Holmes.

The policeman had been working the late shift when 911 calls came through.

Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of 
blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was 
wearing a helmet and gas mask.

He said at first he thought Holmes was a fellow cop, because he was 
dressed in body armor, but he grew suspicious as he noticed Holmes was sitting calmly, and not running toward the murder scene.

Oviatt said he pointed his gun at Holmes, who 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze. He then handcuffed him and searched him.

He
said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes'
car, adding that an ammunition magazine also fell out of Holmes' pocket
and he found another one on the ground.

Officer Justin Grizzle testified that Holmes had a 'smirk' on his face as the carnage unfolded around him.

Fighting
back tears, Officer Grizzle recalled today how he saw 'several' bodies -
and slipped on blood that was on the floor as he entered the theater.

Grizzle
recalled taking some of the wounded to the hospital and said he had to 
stop one man who was worried about his seven-year-old daughter from 
jumping out of the moving patrol car.

He said there was so much blood in his car that he could hear it sloshing around.

The officers also described a hellish
scene inside the cinema on July 20, when 12 people were shot to death 
before their families and friends' eyes and scores of others were 
wounded amid a din of gunshots, screams and the blaring soundtrack of 
The Dark Knight Rises.

Holmes' lawyers called no witnesses and cross-examined only a few of those summoned by prosecutors during the hearing.

But they pointedly raised the issue 
of Holmes' sanity at strategic moments, possibly foreshadowing a defence
that some believe is his best hope to avoid the death penalty.

'You're aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?' defence lawyer Daniel King asked one witness.

The preliminary hearing, which 
ended on Wednesday, was designed to determine whether prosecutors' case 
is strong enough to put Holmes on trial.

Holmes'
lawyers have not said if he will plead not guilty by reason of 
insanity, but since his arrest outside the cinema in the Denver suburb 
of Aurora immediately after the shootings, they have portrayed him as a 
man with serious mental problems prone to bizarre behaviour.

Many legal analysts have said they expect the case to end with a plea bargain rather than a trial.

Tom
Teves, whose son Alex was among the dead, said he would rather see 
Holmes plead guilty to first-degree murder, avoiding a traumatic trial, 
bringing a life sentence and closing the door to an insanity defence.

'Don't pretend he's crazy,' Mr Teves said. 'He's not crazy. He's no more crazy than you and I.

If found not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes could conceivably be released someday if he is deemed to have recovered.

Such a defendant is deemed not guilty
because he didn't know right from wrong and is therefore 'absolved' of 
the crime, said former Jefferson County District Attorney Scott Storey.

Last
year, Bruco Strong Eagle Eastwood was acquitted by reason of insanity 
of attempted first-degree murder in the wounding of two eighth-graders 
outside a school not far from Columbine High School.

Eastwood is spending time in a mental hospital. His case will be reviewed every six months until he's deemed sane and released.
