Two cadets who used Skype to secretly film a female colleague having sex at the Australian Defence Force Academy have escaped jail terms.

Dylan Deblaquiere and Daniel McDonald, both 21, streamed the footage to a dorm at the barracks where five other male cadets watched.

McDonald, who had sex with the 20-year-old recruit, was found guilty of committing an act of indecency and using a carriage service in an offensive manner at a trial earlier this year.

Deblaquiere, whose room was used to broadcast the footage, was convicted of using a carriage service in an offensive manner.

Sentencing the pair at the ACT Supreme Court in Canberra, Acting Justice John Nield acknowledged the impact of the incident on the victim.

He said: 'Her whole world has even shattered, her dignity stolen... her self-worth destroyed'.

The victim, named only as Kate, said at an earlier hearing that she was referred to as 'that Skype slut' by her peers and had been forced to leave her dream job in the military, it was reported by The Canberra Times.

Acting Justice Nield also dismissed McDonald's version of events - that the woman knew she was having sex on Skype - as an 'outrageous and blatant lie'.

But he decided not to jail the pair because of they were young, had good prospects for rehabilitation and had no previous criminal record.

McDonald was handed two 12-month good behaviour orders to run concurrently for his two charges, while Deblaquiere was given one 12 month good behaviour order for the carriage service charge.

In a statement outside court, the victim said she was now looking forward to a 'new positive chapter in my life'.

'Justice Nield has been fair throughout this whole trial and I respect his decision in the matter,' she told ABC News.

Deblaquiere has since left the military, while the Department of Defence has confirmed it will take action against McDonald.
