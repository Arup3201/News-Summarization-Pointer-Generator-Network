Two Germans and two Kenyan pilots were killed when a plane carrying safari tourists crashed in Kenya's Maasai Mara game reserve, local police said today.

Five other passengers on board Mombasa Air's 5YUV7 light aircraft were seriously injured as the pilots prepared to land at Ngerede Airstrip near the Mara Safari Club.

The two tourists killed were a middle-aged man and an elderly woman, Narok district police chief Peterson Maelo confirmed.

The airstrip manager Daniel Jivai said he saw the aircraft wobble before it came down at around 12.17pm.

Speaking to Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation, he said the tourists were travelling from Mombasa to the Mara.

Three of the passengers were trapped in the wreckage but were rescued by hotel and airstrip personnel.

The rest of the passengers were receiving first aid. The aircraft had been carrying 11 passengers, including five Germans, four Americans and two Czechs.

'When we saw it coming down, there was a swift response from hotel personnel, tourists, and other visitors around the place and we managed to put off a small fire on one of the engines,' said Mr Jivai.

Tourists flock from around the world to see the annual wildebeest migration in Kenya's Masai Mara national reserve, 165 miles south west of capital Nairobi

A government team led by Narok South district commissioner, Chamwanga Mongo, was deployed to the area to carry out investigations.

Propeller planes are often used to take tourists to the Masai Mara, one of Africa's most popular attractions.

Tourists travel from around the world to see the spectacular wildebeest migration from Serengeti plains in Tanzania to the Mara.

Many visitors also opting for air travel due to the bad state of the Narok-Mara road.

The reserve is 165 miles south west of capital Nairobi, and has 1.4 million wildebeest and 200,000 zebra and gazelle living on it that migrate each year in search of rain ripened grass.Â 

Cooperatives minister Joseph Nyaga, who was in Narok for an official function, cut short his speech to observe a minute of silence for those who died in the accident.
