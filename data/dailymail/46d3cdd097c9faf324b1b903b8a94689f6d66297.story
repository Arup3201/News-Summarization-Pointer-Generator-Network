One cheating male: The advert which appeared in the Birmingham Mail

Leafing through a regional newspaper's classified adverts, a reader normally expects to find babysitters, cleaners and gardeners touting their services.

But one jilted lover used the section to take her revenge on a cheating partner.

Hidden among adverts for a snooker table and a single bed an advert read 'Useless piece of cheating male Michael McCartan'.

The entry was titled 'Erdington Librarian'.

Directly beneath the piece in the Birmingham Mail was another advert for a 'male cheater £0'. Both entries contained the same local phone number.

The adverts are believed to have been missed by the regional newspaper's classified section editorial team.

'I couldn't believe it when I was flicking through Tuesday's paper at work,' said 37-year-old mother-of-two Julie Wood.

'You don't expect to see something like that in the "bargain" buy section. Whoever put the advert in must have been pretty angry.

'I can understand why she did it, if he has cheated on her then I would want to get my own back and humiliate him too.

'Mind you, an advert in the local paper would be the least of my husband's worries if he had an affair.'

Speaking to MailOnline, a man at Erdington Library who identified himself as Michael McCartan said he did not like 'malicious rumours' being spread about him.

He said: 'I am aware of the advert. I don't know why it was put in there. I didn't know people could put adverts in the paper like that and I'm going to get in touch and make a complaint because I don't like malicious rumours being spread about me.'

When pushed further and asked if he was a married man he said 'thank you for your time' and hung up.

Classifieds: Gardening, furnoture televisions and one cheating man... the adverts that appeared in the Birmingham Mail earlier this week

Last
year millionaire businessman Charles Phillips had his eight-year affair
exposed - when it was plastered on billboards in Time Square, New York.

YaVaughnie Wilkins is said to have paid £150,000 to reveal her relationship to the world after he went back to his wife.

The posters, which are three storeys high, show Miss Wilkins and Mr Phillips - a senior member of  President Obama's hand-picked Economic Recovery Advisory Board - below his initials and a quote saying: 'You are my soulmate forever.'

Two years ago a wife who caught her husband cheating with the babysitter put his Porsche up for sale online at a knockdown price.

The £70,000 car was listed for just £2,000.

The wife, from Solihull, West Midlands, wrote: 'Last week, I caught my husband having it off with our babysitter in our Porsche (actually, MY Porsche as I bloody paid for it). So I'm selling his beloved car. See how the p***k likes that!'
