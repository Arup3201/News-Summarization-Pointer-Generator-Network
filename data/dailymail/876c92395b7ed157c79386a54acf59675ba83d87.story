Talk about having the last word.

Top New York divorce lawyer Norman Sheresky took revenge on his former legal partners by having a video played at his funeral where they praised him for his experience, skill and mentorship.

The New York Post reports Sheresky, who died from pneumonia on October 19 at 85 years old, had said his dying wish was to ban David Aronson and Allan Mayefsky from his funeral in New York.

Top New York City divorce attorney Norman Sheresky, who died on October 19 aged 85, was at war with his former legal partners. A video was played at his funeral from his 80th birthday party where his 'enemies' praised him

The law partners split acrimoniously in 2010 when Sheresky quit the firm aged 82 believing his partners backed out on a deal to look after him financially in retirement. Aronson and Mayesfsky claimed Sheresky had agreed to a buy-out plan three years earlier.

Between them, the trio's high-profile divorce clients have included Christine Brinkley and Peter Cook, Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, and the former wives of actors James Gandolfini, Dustin Hoffmann, and Robert Duvall.

Sheresky's final act was to ask his wife to play a video presentation called 'Norman’s Reflections on his 80th Birthday' that was recorded with Aronson and Mayefsky before their own professional union dramatically fell apart.

Sheresky, Aronson, and Mayefsky represented architect Peter Cook (left) after former model Christine Brinkley (right) filed for divorce in 2008 after 10 years of marriage. Cook was revealed to have had  an affair with his 18-year-old assistant

Sheresky was prominent in New York divorce law and played a major part in establishing the concept of equitable distribution of assets between divorcing couples.

The messy fall out between Sheresky, Aronson, and Mayefsky became its own headline act in New York's legal world.

In 2010, Sheresky filed a $26 million lawsuit in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, alleging breach of contract and fraud.

Attorney David Aronson, pictured left, and partner Allan Mayefsky, right, were once considered part of a 'family' with former partner Norman Sheresky. A dramatic 2010 split between the powerful divorce lawyers rocked the New York City legal world in a bitter dispute from which Sheresky never recovered

'I see now that for Norman it was about money, and I find that to be unfortunate,' Mayefsky told the New York Times at the time of the suit.

In 1972, Sheresky co-authored a book called 'Uncoupling: The Art of Coming Apart' and told the Times he 'treated these people like they were my sons, and they turned on me.'

'It’s like a lot of relationships,' he added. 'We were in love, and somehow they decided they’re not in love anymore.'

Aronson and Mayefsky went on to represent actress Katie Holmes in her divorce from Hollywood heavyweight Tom Cruise. Aronson Mayefsky & Sloan, LLP, is now considered one of the best law firms specializing in divorce in New York City

In the birthday video played at his funeral, Sheresky's wife asks Aronson: 'What do you think the secret is of you three staying together all these years?'

'We love each other,' Aronson replied. 'It goes beyond our professional relationship - the way relatives would love each other.'

Sheresky's law suit against Aronson and Mayefsky hit the rocks in September, 2011, when a Manhattan judge threw out four of five of his claims. The judge allowed one claim for breach of fiduciary duty for not paying Sheresky a bonus in 2009.
