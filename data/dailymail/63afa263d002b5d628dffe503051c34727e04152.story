We're still a month away from new year, but the annual barrage of DVDs promising you a toned body in 2015 are already hitting shelves.

The latest offering to waltz onto the scene comes courtesy of the professional dancers from hit BBC1 show, Strictly Come Dancing.

The duo say that FitSteps is an 'energetic, upbeat dance class designed to achieve real, measurable, fitness results' by mixing the graceful steps of Ballroom and the up-tempo steps of Latin dances.

FitSteps came to life in 2013 when the BBC show's ballroom dancers collaborated with swimmer Mark Foster to devise a fun and effective way to stay fit using dynamic dance steps. 

The DVD features 10 of the most popular Latin and Ballroom dances seen on the show, including Jive, Cha-Cha, Waltz and Quickstep.

Speaking about the DVD, Natalie said: 'You’ll get fit, boost your confidence and have a great time doing so'.  

The Dance Yourself fit DVD will go head-to-head against competitors such as Made In Chelsea's offering, MIC:FIT 

Benefits: Speaking about the DVD, Natalie said: 'You’ll get fit, boost your confidence and have a great time doing so' - so confident are they in the routine that they're launching it into gyms next February
