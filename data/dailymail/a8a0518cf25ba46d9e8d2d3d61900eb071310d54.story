The heatwave sweeping through Donetsk threatens to affect England's Euro 2012 opener against France tomorrow, but that hasn't dampened England fans' moods.

Supporters revelled in the sunshine and enjoyed beers with the locals in the Ukrainian city despite fears that the footballers will be unable to adjust to the soaring temperatures.

England will open their campaign in temperatures of up to 32C tomorrow, 13C higher than those they have acclimatised to in their Polish base of Krakow, while France have been training just down the road at local club Shakhtar Donetsk's centre.

And it would seem that English football chiefs have little confidence in England's ability to achieve a result tomorrow, having already booked the England team's plane home - for after their final group stage game.

England are due to face tournament co-hosts Ukraine in their last group game of the tournament on June 19, but FA bosses have already chartered a private jet home the day after.

The plane is scheduled to fly from England's base in Krakow, Poland, and land at Manchester airport at 4pm on Wednesday 20 June before flying to London.

The FA was unavailable for comment, but is believed to insist the measure is standard procedure.

The scheduling appears to display little confidence in the national team's ability to qualify from a group comprising France, Sweden and Ukraine.

After France, they are due to face Sweden on Friday and Ukraine the following Tuesday before a potential quarter final on the weekend of June 23-24.

Liverpool fan Jonny Bunt, 24, from Swindon, said: '[The heat] could make a difference. You would think the French would be more used to it and able to deal with it better.'

Reflecting the national pessimism, the number of travelling England fans will be the lowest at a tournament for many years, with just 3,000 tickets sold through the official supporters' club for the France game.

But those who did turn up enjoyed sizzling temperatures and friendly conversation with the locals.

Two England fans in particular garnered attention, due to their full Crusaders costume including boots, silver trousers, the St George's Cross and leather arm guards.

Dex Marshall, 52, and Stan Stanfield, 42, posed for pictures with amused Ukrainians near a giant statue of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.

Mr Marshall, a financial adviser from Uckfield, East Sussex, said: 'We went to a nightclub and the people were loving it.

'The only problem is the language. They all want to help us but we can't communicate.'

When asked if the weather could be a factor, he replied: 'It will be a concern because we do have a colder environment than most countries.

'I think it will be a 1-1 draw if we're lucky.'

Earlier this week Government officials chose to boycott England's group stage matches over Ukraine's treatment of jailed former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, although this stance may change if England do make it past the group stages.

Manager Roy Hodgson remained defiant ahead of the kick-off, and insisted the team have 'no fear' of their opponents.

'There’s healthy respect for the France team, as they deserve to have. But I don’t get the feeling the players are cowed by the task. They’re more motivated in a way,' Hodgson said yesterday.

The last time England failed to get through the group stage of a major tournament was at Euro 2000, when they were managed by Kevin Keegan.

France go into tomorrow's match as favourites and on a 21-game unbeaten run but Hodgson said this will provide additional motivation for England.

'It may be quite nice for them to go into a game where people are saying, "It’ll be tough and France are a better team than you".

'I would think they’ll probably quite enjoy the fact that the favourite’s position is now being taken from us and given to France. We know we can give them a good game. No question,' he said.

But French supporters in Donetsk were confident their side would take all three points.

Sebastian Peyres, 36, who works at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, said: 'It will be very difficult for England to organise their team without Rooney and Lampard. It will be 2-0 to France, I hope.'

Hodgson is due to reveal his starting lineup to the players tonight - in stark contrast to former manager Fabio Capello, who notoriously told his players if they were starting just half an hour before the match.

The squad has been strengthened by the return of striker Jermain Defoe, who flew home on Thursday following the death of his father, but Manchester United forward Danny Welbeck is expected to be preferred to Defoe and Andy Carroll.
