Good Samaritan: Sean Lyons, pictured, was found hanging just 12 hours after trying to save the life of Glen Delaney, who was beaten to death during a vicious street attack

A Good Samaritan who battled to save a man's life after he was brutally beaten to death in a street was found hanged 12 hours later.

Sean Lyons, 24, spotted Glen Delaney being attacked in Levenshulme, Manchester, and rushed to give him first aid.

But despite his efforts, the 40-year-old died later that night at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

At 7.30am the next day, Mr Lyons - believed to have been left  traumatised by the incident - was found hanged in a field in Stockport.

Mr
Lyons' death is the second in relation to
Mr Delaney's murder, after police found a 23-year-old woman dead in a 
house on 
June 6.

Tributes have now flooded in for Mr Lyons, from Heaton Chapel, who friends and family said 'lived life to the full'.

Friend Michael Dolan, 24, who was with him the night they found Mr Delaney in Barlow Road, Levenshulme,
said: 'Sean was just a star. That night we were driving and he saw 
someone on the floor and said "stop the car, stop the car!".

'He got out and tried first aid and called the ambulance but they couldn't help him.

'He was really a top lad, always smiling. Just a star. It's a tragedy.'

His devastated mother Marie Lyons added:
'The number of tributes and messages of condolence we have received 
have been amazing and are a testament to our son.

'Sean was well liked and respected, the number of people whose lives were touched by Sean is untold.

'He always looked out for others and spent a lot of time talking to older people for whom he had a very high regard.

'Everyone who knew Sean was aware that he lived life to the full, a great night out with his friends was always in order.'

Mr Lyons was a popular student at St Ann's Roman Catholic High School and Aquinas College in Stockport. He went on to work on road surfacing with his father Andy.

Mrs Lyons added: 'Sean took great pride in his work and was well known and respected in his area of work. He made many friends in his short working life and maintained strong relationships with friends from school, college and work.

'Sean made us proud of his work ethic and his ability to make friends, he was a loyal son and friend to many.'

David Gray, 29, from Levenshulme, has been charged with the murder of Mr Delaney following an attack on May 30.

A Home Office post-mortem examination confirmed he died as a result of severe facial injuries.

A further five people - two men aged 42, 34 and three women aged 23, 23 and 65 have all been bailed pending further inquiries.

In a statement, Mr Delaney's family paid tribute, saying: 'Dad's number one son will never be forgotten. In loving memory of Glen from mum, dad, sisters, nephews, nieces and all family.'
