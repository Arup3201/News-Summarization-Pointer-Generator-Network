Two swimmers who had gotten caught in the riptide at a Southern California beach while their small children watched from shore found aid arriving in the form of a helpful Bernese mountain dog.

It was late Thursday afternoon at a beach in Ventura when three-year-old Nico raced into the water after a woman who had become trapped by the current began calling for help.

The dog's owner, Dan Clarke, himself a former lifeguard, told KTLA about watching as Nico paddled out to the struggling woman.

Hero dog: Three-year-old Nico paddled out to rescue a woman who had gotten caught in the current at Ventura Beach in California

'He went right out to her, right up to the side of the boogie board and he swum his body around while he was swimming,' Clarke told the network. 'I just said, "Grab him anywhere you can."'

The woman grabbed onto Nico's chest and held her boogie board with the other hand, allowing Nico to guide her to shore.  

The woman's husband had tried to swim the 100 yards out to his wife, but he had also become taken by the current and couldn't reach her.

'I know how treacherous it is out here and what a false sense of security it is,' said Clarke's wife Vivian. 'To be not that far off shore and just get caught out and nobody around to help you.'

It was only a few months ago the Clarkes had adopted Nico, who was now paying it forward by rescuing the couple caught in the water. 

Grateful: The couple joined their children back on the beach, grateful to Nico for coming to their rescue while in the water

Amazed: Dan Clarke, Nico's owner and a former lifeguard, said he had never seen his newly adopted dog perform a feat like the one he saw on the beach

'The woman and the gentleman they were just exhausted,' said Dan Clarke about the unidentified couple. 'They just looked and said "Is that like a trained life-saving dog?"' 

'That's the first time I've seen him doing something like that,' Clarke says he told them.
