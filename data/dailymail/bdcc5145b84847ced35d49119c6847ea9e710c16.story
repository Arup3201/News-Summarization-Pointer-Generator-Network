Confession: Russian police today confirmed that principal Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has confessed to ordering the acid attack

A top Bolshoi Ballet dancer has confessed to police that he ordered a ruthless sulphuric acid attack on the world famous troupe's artistic director in a case as dramatic as one of its famed productions.

Star soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko -  best known
for playing Ivan the Terrible on the Moscow stage - allegedly 'masterminded' a 'hit' that left Sergei Filin, 42, almost blind and his face disfigured.

After being seized by police, the 29-year-old said: 'I organized that attack but not to the extent that it occurred.'

A police source said: 'The motive of the crime was the hostile personal relationship Pavel Dmitrichenko had with Sergei Filin, which was linked to their work.'

Two others, Yury Zarutsky, 35, suspected perpetrator of the attack, and Andrey Lipatov, 31, allegedly driver of the get-away car, are also said to have signed written confessions for playing a part in the January incident.

The treacherous row at the top of Russian ballet has shocked the country.

It is claimed the dancer's dispute with Filin was over
his 21-year-old 'partner' Anzhelina Vorontsova, another Bolshoi
dancer, who the director allegedly snubbed for a job.

Vorontsova is a student of leading dancer Nikolai
Tsiskaridze who is seen as a rival of Filin, but who strongly denied any role
in the attack.

Filin always said he knew the identity of the person who ordered the attack on him gave detailed information to police before he left for Germany.

Arrests: Alleged masked attacker Yury Zarutsky (left) and Andrei Lipatov (right), the driver who took part in attack on Filin, have both confessed to their involvement, police say

He is said to be 'relieved but 
not surprised' by the arrests and confessions.

Filin, 42, a former Bolshoi star dancer, was almost blinded
in the attack but has recovered partial sight and is now being treated in
Germany for severe burns which disfigured his face. 

A jar of sulphuric acid was thrown directly into his face.

Dmitrichenko's sensational confession supports the police's
theory that the attack in Moscow was an 'inside job' at
the world's most famous classical ballet theatre.

No statement has been issued as yet by Dmitrichenko or on
his behalf.

There is palpable shock at the Bolshoi which said on Tuesday
that they were unaware of any massive breakdown in relations between Filin and Dmitrichenk.

'All three have  confessed to the crime,'
said a statement by Moscow police. 'All three are arrested now according
to the Article 91 of Russian Criminal Code.'

Before the attack and after: Until now, 
suspicion has focused on it being a 'contract hit' ordered by a rival 
from inside the Bolshoi, or a member of the troupe who had fallen foul 
of Filin

been upset about the treatment of his Bolshoi partner Anzhelina

The group voluntarily signed confessions, said a police
source.

'Other police operations aimed to establish all the
details of this crime are now being carried out by Moscow police.'

Yesterday's arrests were the first 
tangible progress in a probe over the  attack on Filin, who required 
emergency surgery to save his eyesight.

The assault plunged the Bolshoi a major crisis and shocked the ballet world.

A Moscow police statement said: 
'Moscow policemen searched the apartment of Bolshoi theatre dancer
Pavel Dmitrichenko in connection with the investigation of the attack 
on the Bolshoi theatre head of the troupe Sergei Filin.'

esterday it was also reported that Russian police used mobile phone data to arrest a key suspect.

'The suspects were located with the help of mobile operators,' said the report.  'Police checked all phone calls made from mobiles not far from Filin's block of flats, where he was attacked.

'Comparing a huge amount of information, the police managed to find the attackers.'

Bolshoi spokeswoman 
Yekaterina Novikova told RIA Novosti news agency that 'investigators 
have confirmed to me that they have detained the person who committed 
the attack'.

Performance: Pavel Dmitrichenko as Ivan The Terrible in Bolshoi in November

Suspect: Pavel Dmitrichenko has an apartment in the same block as Filin although it is rented out to a woman

Crisis: General view of the hall from the Bolshoi Theatre stage in Moscow- the attack on Filin plunged the Bolshoi into a grave crisis

She said overnight police operation was 'good news for us'.

She added: 'We are not aware of any conflict between Filin and Dmitrichenko. Its obvious there are many satisfied and unsatisfied people in the theatre but there was no sudden conflict between them.'

Novikova expressed the hope that Filin 
will return full time to his role by the time the Bolshoi troupe makes 
its scheduled appearance in London this summer.

In the two weeks after the attack, he underwent a series of eye operations in Moscow aimed at saving as much eyesight as possible.
