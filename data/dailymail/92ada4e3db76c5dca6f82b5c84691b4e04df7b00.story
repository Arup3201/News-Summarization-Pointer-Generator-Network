Most children can be prone to temper tantrums if they don't get their own way but Sapphire Bubb, nine, has become so aggressive, even her own mother is terrified of her.

Single mother, Pauline, 47, from Southampton, says her daughter's behaviour can be so unpredictable she dreads outings and special occasions like birthday parties, and she feels like a victim of domestic abuse because of the daily barrage of abuse she gets at home. 

'Her behaviour has deteriorated from being a normal child to attacking me on a daily basis. Very few people have seen her that way as it's behind doors,' Pauline told Channel 5 show My Violent Child.

'She can be a complete Jekyll and Hyde - one minute she's a loving child and the next she can turn, biting, pulling hair, trying to pull my earrings out, punching, kicking, trying to break things. 

'She is only a tiny little thing and she goes through this thing and it scares me. I have been attacked at least 30 times in one day. It can be for any reason.'

The Channel 5 show goes into their home to reveal how Sapphire can be aggressive - both physically and verbally - over the smallest of things if she doesn't get her own way. 

During one outburst, she is seen shouting at her mother: 'It's not f***ing working, don't f***ing talk to me' over a toy and when her mild-mannered twin sister, Jorja, tells her to 'stop being silly' she retorts: 'Shut up you b****!'

Pauline is at the end of her tether as after Spencer was diagnosed, Sapphire then started acting violently. 'It feels like I am in domestic violence with my kids,' she said

In another shocking scene, she bites her mother's face during a meltdown over homework and then sobs in her arms because she's sorry for what she's done. 

'I don't understand why I get angry, I hurt people and I kick them,' Sapphire said. 

It's not the first time Pauline has experienced physical abuse at the hands of one of her children. 

As previously reported by MailOnline, Pauline found raising her son, Spencer, now 11, a real challenge as he was prone to regular violent outbursts and he once stabbed her with some scissors.

At the age of five, he was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and put on anti-psychotic medication. 

'Before the diagnosis he could be really violent, he stabbed me with scissors, he tried to strangle me, he could be violent punching, kicking and swearing,' Pauline recalled.

Spencer has calmed down thanks to his diagnosis but Pauline now faces another violent battleground with Sapphire.

After the problems she experienced with Spencer when he was younger and now Sapphire, Pauline said: 'It feels like I am in domestic violence with my kids. 

'They have taken the role of the abusive partner. This can't go on, I don't know how to deal with it. 

'I try my hardest I put my all into everything for them and they just seem to fight me all the way.' 

Pauline often has to retreat her to bedroom in fear of her children's behaviour and is left in tears over what she can do to bring harmony to their home.

'I do worry that it's me, where did I go wrong? I do the best I can do at as a mum but I worry it's down to my parenting skills,' she admits.

Caught in the firing line is her other daughter, Jorja, who often retreats to sit on her own when her sister's tantrums begin and is often at the receiving end of her verbal abuse herself. Trying to play a simple games of cards with her sister can result in her being sworn and shouted at.

Islay Downey, a parenting practitioner who helped Pauline when she struggled with Spencer, returns to help the family again now Sapphire is causing problems.

She said Pauline needs to establish a routine, set more ground rules and be more assertive. She advised Pauline to work on her own self-esteem as her lack of confidence in her parenting is holding her back.

'At the moment the children are on control and that's a very unsafe place for children,' she said.

She observed that Jorja was often the victim as she withdraws to find a corner to sit on her own while her mother and sister fight.

Islay said: 'Sapphire has learnt a pattern of behaviour that if she wants attention, this (being violent and aggressive) is the way to get it. 

Pauline is urged by a parenting practitioner to be more assertive and self-confident - she has let her children take too much control

'It's like a dripping tap, little by little we have to get mum to be more assertive. Pauline needs to focus more on Jorja, that retreating isn't good for her.'

The family are taken for 'intensive weekend intervention' at an outdoor activity centre in the New Forest to help them.

Islay said: 'From experience, it helps to taken them away from a familiar environment where they have to break familiar patterns of behaviour.'

During the weekend, the family do role play exercises where they recreate arguments taking the part of each other so they can see the situation from the other person's perspective. 

They also take part in survival activities in the forest and games where they have to work together.

A weekend away with her twin girls proves a revelation as Pauline finally starts being the boss

The activities all work towards Pauline reestablishing control instead of letting Sapphire take charge.

The mother is amazed by the transformation in her children's behaviour when she is the boss.

She said: 'When I have made a suggestion they haven't kicked off and have listen to what I have said which is a good thing. Now I'm in my element, I'm really happy. 

'The one thing I will take home is positivity, their behaviour has been amazing.'

Islay says she's hopeful Pauline 'will now go from strength to strength' and take what she had learnt back into the home environment.
