Reality TV star Frankie Essex has put an end to her yo-yo dieting, which she says has plagued her for the last 10 years.

Until now, the TOWIE star had been unable to break out of the 'big horrible' cycle which has seen her weight shoot up and down.

She embraced a new healthier lifestyle two months ago - working out with a personal trainer four times a week and eating a clean diet - and it's certainly paid off.

New woman: Frankie Essex, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has shed two stone, taking her to her ideal weight of 10st 7lb after embarking on a healthy new regime

Since then, Frankie, who is 5 ft 7in, has lost two stone - slimming down to her ideal weight of 10st 7lb. And she is sure that this time she will keep off the weight for good.

She feels so much slimmer and sexier that she is now planning a second breast augmentation - having previously had implants taking her up to a 32G.

Frankie, 27, said: 'I do feel like a new woman. I was panic-stricken when I first started working out with the trainer.

'I didn't think I would be able to cope and there were times when I was so worried about it that I had difficulty breathing.

'But once I got into a regular routine, I could really feel my life turning around. I now feel so much more confident and healthier.'

Frankie dates her yo-yo weight problems back to her mother Tina's suicide 14 years ago.

Tina, who was 38 at the time, hanged herself after suffering from depression and Frankie and her TOWIE star brother Joey, 24, were brought up by their father Donny, 53, who works at Billingsgate fish market in London.

Frankie said: 'I started to put on a lot of weight. My dad was amazing bringing us up but cooking wasn't his strong point.

'I used to live off microwave meals and I started piling on the pounds.'

Frankie went on her first crash diet at 18 when her weight peaked at 12st 7lb. She lost three stone very quickly but it left her with sagging skin around her tummy and arms.

Bright future: Frankie quit The Only Way Is Essex last year after nine series. She is now a successful businesswoman with her own haircare range

She explained: 'I lost the weight too quickly and without embracing a healthier lifestyle. I was way too skinny and it left me with a lot of loose skin, particularly around my tummy.

'It was embarrassing because people mistakenly thought I'd previously had a child and the sagging skin was baby fat as a result of the pregnancy.

'It wasn't at all - it was just down this diet. I’ve never had a child.'

Frankie continued on this destructive cycle of losing weight and then putting it all on again through binge eating and partying.

She knew she had to make a permanent lifestyle change to end the nightmare.

That happened when she signed up with celebrity weightloss trainer Ian Guildford, who has helped Binky Felstead and Luisa Zissman lose weight.

They started working out four times a week and Ian recommended Frankie started using Forza Supplements' Raspberry K2 capsules.

Frankie said: 'The Forza K2s made a big difference. They gave me more energy before my sessions with Ian and they sped up my metabolism.

'I'd often forget about food because I simply didn't feel hungry. This was the first time that I have really got to grips with a proper exercise regime.

'I'm addicted to it now and won't go back to my old lifestyle. I love the feeling of wellbeing it gives me.

'The days of my weight yo-yoing are over.'

Frankie quit The Only Way Is Essex last year after nine series. She is now a successful businesswoman with her own haircare range and lives with her boyfriend John Lyons, 28, a painter and decorator, in Buckhurst Hill, Essex.

She had a breast enhancement two years ago - going from 32D to 32G, but she is now thinking of having a reduction or possibly new implants to make her bust smaller.

She doesn't miss the ITV show that sky-rocketed her to fame - and says it wrecked her diet plans.

She said: 'I'd had enough in the end. We lived off Domino's Pizza and we'd be eating and drinking at all the wrong times. I'd be drinking glasses of wine and filming nightclub scenes at 10am!'

She was proud to be one of the  'real girls' along with Lauren Goodger, another of the show's stars who has struggled with her weight.

Frankie said: 'I remember going away to Miami with Lauren and we were both pictured on the beach looking absolutely awful. I looked at the magazines and thought: "Oh my God, what the hell do we look like".

'We both promised that we would lose weight after seeing the pictures and we both did get thinner. The trouble was the weight went back on a few weeks later.'

Despite her weight loss, she knows she will always be curvy 'I have got hips and I am not offended at being called pear-shaped - that is the way I am.

8am breakfast - two poached eggs and smoked salmon

10am Forza Rasberry K2 supplement

11am - 90 minutes fitness training

1pm lunch - grilled chicken and salad

6pm dinner - grilled monkfish and asparagus

'I love my curves and have always been comfortable with my figure. Kim Kardashian has done a lot to make curvier women feel good about themselves. She showed you don't have to be stick insect like Kate Moss to look good.'

Frankie admits being overweight left her feeling depressed. 'You look at pictures of yourself and you think, "I am disgusting,"' she said. 'You end up hating yourself and getting into a real hole. It is not healthy.'

Frankie envies her brother Joey, who is stick-thin yet eats what he likes. She said: 'We are very different in that respect. I only have to look at a cake and it appears on my thighs.

'Joey is very lucky - he has always had an amazing body without even trying. He lost three stone when he was in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity. He was dangerously thin when he came out but he soon recovered and got his old zip back.'

As well as taking the supplements, Frankie says she has lost weight by using a smaller plate.

She explained: 'I hate leaving food and always like to clear my plate. I find it helpful to use a smaller plate - psychologically the meal seems bigger if it is piled up on a smaller plate rather than spread out over a bigger.

'You feel fuller when you have finished it - it works for me!'
