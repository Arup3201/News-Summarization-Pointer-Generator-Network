Roy Keane says he wouldn’t have made the same mistake as Rio Ferdinand by missing a drugs test.

Ferdinand was handed an eight-month ban and fined £50,000 for missing the routine test at the training ground in September 2003.

The former Manchester United captain passes the damning verdict in his autobiography The Second Half, which is released on Thursday.

In extracts released by the Daily Mirror: 'He (Rio) suffered for it and so did the team.

'If it had been me, and the doctor had said I had to do a drugs test, I'd have gone and done it. It wasn't something I'd have forgotten. 

'It wouldn't have been like collecting a letter at the office, or remembering your boots. 

'When a doctor says you've got to do a drugs test, it's not an everyday thing. But then, some people are genuinely forgetful.

'I don't think I was annoyed at the time, and I don't think the other players were either. 

'But, ultimately, the team suffered. I didn't look at Rio and think that he'd been up to no good, or that there was a hidden reason for what had occurred.

'I think he genuinely forgot. We paid the price. 

'He was a very good player and we missed him, especially in the second half of the season when the crunch games were coming up.' 

Ferdinand lost an appeal against the ban and missed Euro 2004 for England as a result of his ban before making his return in a 2-1 victory for Manchester United against Liverpool at Old Trafford.

Ferdinand, currently playing for Harry Redknapp's QPR, has recently released his autobiography, #2sides, as the 35-year-old reaches the twilight of his career.

'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: "This is great isn’t it?". I went: "I used to play in these games Adrian". I wasn’t being cocky.

'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: "Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: "I liked your commentary last night". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me.

'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!"'

'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No.

'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'
