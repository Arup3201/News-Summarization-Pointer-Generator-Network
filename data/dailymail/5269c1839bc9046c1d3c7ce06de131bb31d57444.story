‘When the ball goes into control zone – team must make at least three passes before hitting the CF [centre forward].

‘Once the ball is played into the end zone – 2 MFs [midfielders] try to get in and support for a 3v2.

‘However, if the defending team win the ball back they counter straight away.’

*This is clearly Gary Neville's training notes and not secret tactical information for the big match against Italy. As big supporters of the England team, there's no way MailOnline Sport would publish details that would harm Roy Hodgson's pursuit of World Cup glory.

Gary Neville revealed his coaching crib sheet to photographers in Rio on Wednesday.

On one side of the England coach’s notes, you can make out the instructions from a training session.

‘When the ball goes into control zone — team must make at least 3 passes before hitting the CF [centre forward].

‘Once the ball is played into the end zone — 2 MFs [midfielders] try to get in and support for a 3v2.

‘However, if the defending team win the ball back they counter straight away.’

The scribbles in no way gave away Roy Hodgson’s game plan for the Italy clash.

However, they did suggest England are attempting to be primed to protect the ball and value possession in a crowded midfield in the heat of the Amazon.

‘Three passes’ suggests Neville wants to discourage his midfielders from attempting to penetrate Italy too soon.

Quick penetration is very much the style in the Barclays Premier League but it comes with risk.

Italy will protect the ball and the last thing Roy Hodgson will want is for his players to spend 90 minutes chasing the ball in Manaus, where the humidity will be crippling.

‘Two midfielders in support’ hints at an England midfield three, which would match Italy’s central trio of Pirlo, Verratti and De Rossi, because Hodgson would not encourage two to chase on and support in attack if they were  only a midfield pair. That would leave no anchorman.

‘Counter attack’ will be the order to drop in and regroup quickly, because almost every team will seek to destroy with a swift break at the turnover of possession.

Neville later tweeted: 'My curtains have been closed permanently for the duration of this tournament! Haha.'
