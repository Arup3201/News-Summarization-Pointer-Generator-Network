It took a speaker box and a pair of platform wedges, but Nicki Minaj has managed to best basketball giant Kobe Bryant in the height stakes.

The unlikely couple - she 5'2'' and he 6'6'' - appear on the cover of ESPN Magazine‘s forthcoming Music Issue, which also focuses on the upcoming 2014 Super Bowl and 10 year anniversary of Janet Jackson‘s infamous wardrobe malfunction.

In an exclusive first look of the magazine - which hits stands this Friday, January 24 - the pair team up for a cosy photo shoot and talk about their respective careers.

Whose taller now?: Nicki Minaj gets on top of the height difference between her and basketball star Kobe Bryant in an exclusive photo shoot for ESPN The Magazine, out Friday

'I don’t care what profession you’re in - It’s hard to have elite success year after year, over and over,' Bryant, who has been sidelined from the LA Lakers following knee surgery, told the magazine.

Height aside, the two - both in their early thirties - are indisputable stars of their chosen fields.

Among the other cover couplings for the mag are Detriot Lions star Calvin Johnson and Eminem and NBA player Chris Paul and hip hop artist Kendrick Lamar.

Lamar will perform with Blurred Lines superstar Robin Thicke at the magazine's Super Bowl event, ESPN The Party, on January 31.

This year's Super Bowl halftime show will be headlined by Bruno Mars.
