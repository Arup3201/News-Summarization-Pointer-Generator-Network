Brazil right-back Maicon has been dropped from the national squad after a serious breach of discipline.

Maicon, a former Manchester City defender, played the whole match of returning manager Dunga’s first game in charge, a 1-0 win over Colombia in Miami on Saturday.

However the 33-year-old, who has 76 caps, has been dropped as Brazil prepare for a friendly against Ecuador in New York on Tuesday.

Maicon joined Manchester City in 2012 from Inter Milan for £3m but failed to cope with life in the Premier League.

He completed a move back to Serie A with Roma last summer after making just nine top-flight appearances for the Premier League champions.
