Imports of Rioja rose 10 per cent last year as more Britons switched to Spanish wine, a new report reveals. 

Shipments reached 36.2million litres in 2014 with experts predicting that total imports from the country will soon exceed those from neighbouring France.

The UK accounted for one third of sales of wine from the Rioja region of northern Spain, according to figures from The Grocer, a trade magazine.

Most of the growth came from the cheapest category of red – unaged.

The more expensive, and mature, crianza, riserva and gran riserva categories grew more modestly while exports of white and rosé Rioja fell.

In contrast, the Spanish domestic market, which still accounts for 63 per cent of total Rioja sales, shifted towards white and aged reds.

In the next two largest Rioja export markets, Germany and the US, volumes rose 2.2 per cent and fell 1.9 per cent respectively. 

Outside the UK, strong growth came from Mexico, up 27.9 per cent, and Russia, up 12.3 per cent, though each accounts for less than 3 per cent of total exports.

The report said that Rioja exports have grown in nine of the past 11 years with 2008 and 2009 the exceptions.

The rest of the wine industry has declined, amid predictions Spanish wines will soon enjoy a greater market share then their French rivals.

Total exports of the wine, from the La Rioja region of northern Spain, reached a record 106million litres with the UK accounting for more than a third. 

Spanish domestic consumption was 175million litres bringing total sales to 281million litres.
