Australia nearly lost music legend Ian Molly Meldrum in December 2011, when he fell three-metres from a ladder at his home in Richmond, south-east of Melbourne, Victoria. 

The music guru was in a coma for five weeks in intensive care but was released from hospital after he made a slow recovery in January.

The life-threatening experience left Meldrum, 71, with a deep fear of ladders, as he revealed on Channel Seven's program Sunday Night on Sunday his struggle to recover from the traumatic accident.

Music legend Molly Meldrum openly discusses his bisexuality and says he 'loves everyone'

Appearing on Channel Seven’s Sunday Night on Sunday, Meldrum openly discusses the life-threatening accident that occurred in December 2011

'I got home from a busy day - I had a few drinks as well I might add - and I went outside to check the lights,' Meldrum said on the Sunday Night program. 

Meldrum climbed a ladder in his backyard, slipped and hit his head on an Egyptian statue.

‘I remember falling and thinking oh my god what have I done and then bang,’ Meldrum said.

He suffered head injuries, a fractured skull, swelling to the brain, cracked vertebrae, broken shoulder and ribs. Meldrum underwent a number of surgical procedures. 

The TV star admits it took a long time for him to get the courage to go out into his backyard.

'And even now I can't look at people climbing ladders - it just freaks me out'. 

Luckily, Meldrum lived to see another day and the out-pour of love that came from Australians praying for the TV star.

The former Countdown presenter said he had been touched by the support from friends, family and fans during the time of the accident.

'All the cards, the emails, flowers and everything - it was overwhelming - I didn't know how to handle it,' he said.

Surviving the fall prompted Meldrum to finish his autobiography and take a walk down memory lane.

The music legend made his mark in Australia when becoming the host of Countdown, a weekly pop music show, in 1974.

'When we started, we did the eight shows and I thought that was it. 

'We never ever thought we would go on year, after year, after year, after year and become so popular.'

The weekly TV series stayed on air for 13 years.

Australian musician and TV presenter, Red Symons, describes Meldrum's talent as completely natural and innocently incompetent.

'His great strength as a interviewer is that he's obviously completely incompetent whenever you see him interview somebody, so he sets people at ease,' said Symons, who shared the screen with Meldrum on Hey, Hey It's Saturday, a long-time running comedy program in Australia.

Success followed Meldrum, as he became an iconic figure in Australian music and pop culture

But before Meldrum rose to fame, life was not easy. 

Growing up in a small country town in Victoria, Quambatook, the TV star was raised by his aunties and uncles after his mother was placed in a psychiatric ward for depression. 

In the early 60s Meldrum was sent to St Kilda in Melbourne to finish high-school - he was living with his aunties when he introduced himself to one of his neighbours - Ronnie Burns. 

'He said, "My name is Ian Meldrum... I need to get away from my aunties could I come and live with you for two weeks?,"' Burns said.

'He stayed nine and a half years.

'Looking back and in hindsight, he was looking for a family.' 

Both Burns, an Australian rock singer and guitarist, and Meldrum found their place in the music world through their love of The Beatles.

'We had this pissy, little radio and suddenly they played this song - I wanna hold your hand - I was like, "What's that?" - I was hooked,' Meldrum said.

Meldrum's passion for music led to a career in music reporting, and then eventually saw him producing - his first song, Russell Morris' hit, The Real Thing. 

Success followed Meldrum, as he became an iconic figure in Australian music and pop culture. 

On the Sunday night program, Meldrum revealed his dream of marriage and having a family and openly discussed past relationships with men.

When asked whether he is gay, straight or bisexual, Meldrum replied simply, 'I love everyone - I love the company of girls.' 

He said the desire to have a family stemmed from his up-bringing. 

'I've never really had a "family-family", so I've always had my friends to become part of my family.'
