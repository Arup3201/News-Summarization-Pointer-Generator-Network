As any actor will attest, the acting industry is tough to break into. But there are even more challenges once you break through, Lucy Liu has confessed.

In an exclusive interview she talks about the typecasting and racism she's faced.

'I
 wish people wouldn’t just see me as the Asian girl who beats everyone 
up, or the Asian girl with no emotion. People see Julia Roberts or 
Sandra Bullock in a romantic comedy, but not me. You add race to it, and
 it became, "Well, she’s too Asian", or, "She’s too American".

'I
 kind of got pushed out of both categories. It’s a very strange place to
 be. You’re not Asian enough and then you’re not American enough, so it 
gets really frustrating.'

'I can’t say that there is no racism - there’s definitely something 
there that’s not easy, which makes [an acting career] much more 
difficult,' she says.

When quizzed on her love life, Liu shows she's no wiser than the rest of us when it comes to guessing relationship status when in uncertain territory.

'It’s a mixed bag right now... It’s a giant question mark for me, as well. I wish I could answer - I wish I knew the answer myself,' the Charlie’s Angels actress says.

In
 the past she has talked of wanting children, but says: 'It just hasn’t 
happened yet,' adding that she might do it alone at some point.

In a photo shoot for the eye-opening 
interview for this week’s Net-A-Porter digital magazine, Liu features in
 stunning pictures wearing elegantly sculpted graphic dresses
 and separates by Gucci, Lanvin, Hervé Léger, Maison Martin Margiela and
 Burberry Prorsum.

In her latest role she plays a female Dr Watson in the CBS television series, Elementary, the most recent reboot of Sherlock Holmes.

'It was a challenge,' she says.

'It's so steeped in history, you want to keep that temperature, but acclimatise people to something new you're shifting them towards.'

When asked to reflect on her favourite
 roles her answer is Lucky Number Slevin with Josh Hartnett and Watching The Detectives, 
two movies she admits 'not many people' have seen.

'Both are special to me because I 
didn't have to do any kind of action or karate kicks. It was just about 
the acting, and I was able to stretch my muscles in them,' she says.

'Well, figuratively, anyway.'
