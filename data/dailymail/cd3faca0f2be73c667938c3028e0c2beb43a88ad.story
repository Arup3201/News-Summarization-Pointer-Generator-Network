An artist has created a series of magical photos which are inspired by the colourful childhood imaginations of her young subjects.

Vicki-Lea Boulter, 42, from Torquay, was fed up with forcing children to sit in front of a plain white background and smile and decided she wanted to bring their imaginations to life.  

The photographer sits down with the children and talks about their dreams and interests before getting them into a role for the picture.

The award-winning photographer has developed amazing digital techniques to edit the images using Photoshop to create the final picture with the whole creative process taking just a few hours from start to finish.

Vicki believes that the whole process gives the child a stronger connection with the final photo and allows their creativity and imagination to shine through.

She has photographed everything from children playing cricket, fairies in a snow globe, aspiring chefs and astronauts, babies in baskets and also hundreds of Frozen themed shoots.

Around 50 of these portraits  will be released as part of a book, I Can Be Anything, in January.

Vicki, who shoots everything in her studio in Torquay, Devon, said: 'I started Children’s Fantasy Portraiture after a child came to my studio kicking and screaming in a pretty dress, shouting "I don’t want to smile, I just want to play".

'This got me thinking. Why am I buying in to the idea of making children look pretty and pose for a camera at such a young age?

'Don’t we all get sad when our teens become obsessed with selfies, the way they look, and about being pretty, when they have so much more to offer?

'That’s when I decided that from now on, when a child comes to the studio, I will talk to them first, find out about them and the person they are and what they love to do.

'Kids are only little people, there is so much going on between their little ears that we don’t always give them credit for, even from a very early age. 

'The Inquisitive Fairy' featuring Shayla Rose Kim Hamilton, 9 months old. Vicki wants to encourage children to play more and explore their imaginations while they are still young 

'We should be encouraging our children to play, and explore their minds and imagination, and arm them with the confidence and tools to march forward in life and become the person they want to be and not think the only thing that matters is how you look for a photo.

'This is what producing this book has done for me.'

Vicki-Lea hopes that one day the children featured in the book will think about what their dreams are and who they want to be and realise that this means much more than what they look like.

Part of the proceeds of Vicki's book will go to Little Princess Trust, a charity supported by Jessie J, which provides wigs for children suffering hair loss.
