Dejan Lovren pauses as he carefully considers the question. He has been talking about his journey to Liverpool, from Zagreb to Southampton via Lyon, but has now been asked to revisit the life-shaping events of his childhood.

Lovren, Liverpool’s new commanding £20million defender, was born in Zenica, a small town in the former Yugoslavia. When the Bosnian war erupted, his father, Sasa, and mother, Silva, made the decision one night in 1992 to flee to Germany with him and his brother, Davor.

A year later, on April 19, 1993, as the conflict spiralled out of control, a market place in his home town came under fire from heavy shelling: 15 people were killed and another 50 seriously injured in what became known as the Zenica Massacre.

‘I don’t know what would have happened if we had stayed,’ says Lovren. ‘I think somebody would have been killed – I don’t know. It was horrible in that time. I think in 1992 my parents took the decision and said “we don’t have a choice anymore.”

‘My father and mother’s parents were already in Germany so we were the last to go. They literally took their bags, one little car and went to Germany. It was difficult for my parents to leave the country after they had been there for 27, 28 years.

‘They said “come on we need to go to Germany”. You don’t even speak German, you know nothing about the country so you are going like a blind man. And with a three-year-old child like me to take too, it was really difficult for them at that time.

‘After seven years in Germany the situation calmed down. We went back in 1999 (they were sent back as they did not have the right paperwork). But, you know, I think this is what gave something to me; made something stronger inside me. It showed me that this life is never easy.’

If his life in Germany ended in sour manner, that was the country were his dreams took flight. Lovren supported Bayern Munich and would regularly take the subway to stand outside Sabener Strasse, Munich’s fabled headquarters, hunting for pictures and autographs.

‘I had my photos taken with Giovane Elber, (Mario) Basler, (Bixente) Lizarazu… I had all these pictures in my room,’ he recalls. ‘I would go to the training ground to see them. It was the best.

‘I was a normal child, playing with the kids. It was only when Dinamo Zagreb wanted to sign me that I felt I had a chance. I now sign autographs every time. I know what it means for a parents to see their child smiling after the autograph. Nobody should mind giving up 10 minutes.’

‘You will earn everything with work,’ he adds. ‘I said to myself “I don’t want to live my life like this”. My parents gave me everything they could but it was not amazing. Maybe it was better to happen like this than to have a (privileged) childhood when you don’t know the real life.’

Do not discount the effort it has taken to get where he is. From the 100-mile round trips he would take from Karlovac to Zagreb as a teen, to fighting off critics in France after his €10m move to Lyon – “they always questioned me” – Lovren is not going to be fazed by the task that awaits on Merseyside.

He is only 25 but the maturity and clarity with which Lovren speaks shows why Brendan Rodgers wanted to make him the most expensive defender in Liverpool’s history; the leader who could fill the chasm in Liverpool’s defence since Jamie Carragher retired.

After scoring in the 4-0 win over Borussia Dortmund, Rodgers called him 'perfect' and one aspect which so impressed was how vocal he was; that may seem a small point but it is significant as Carragher departure saw an end to orders being bellowed from the back at Anfield.

‘Brendan said to me because he has seen me as a leader,’ Lovren explains. ‘I said to him “I’m still young.” But I will try my best. I will lead the team. I don’t have so many experiences like Jamie Carragher but I think it will come with time.

‘I said also it’s a great honour to be compared with a legend like him. I have a lot of time in front of me so I will just keep working and it will come one day.

The first step, inevitably, sees him face Southampton. He had a successful year on the South Coast and, out of respect, he is reluctant to comment on what has unfolded with so much change but does he have regrets?

‘Yes maybe, a little bit,’ the Croatia international replies. ‘But I said also to them that I want to leave because Liverpool is a massive club and maybe I will have this chance just one time in my life. I didn’t want to see the chance going.

‘Maybe it was a difficult relationship but, at the end, everybody agreed and that’s most important. I shook their hands, said goodbye so now it is finished. It was destiny (to play them). I will just have to concentrate on my game and I won’t think about Southampton. This is a new beginning.’
