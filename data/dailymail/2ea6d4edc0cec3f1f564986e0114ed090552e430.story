She was spotted dancing the night away with a succession of cowboys at a hoedown in the Mid-West.

And one of her partners has revealed he found Pippa Middleton to be 'a real pretty woman' who moved well on the dance floor at the bar in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 

Swing-dance cowboy Chris Koch admitted he was usually 'more impressed with a good horse', but said he found the Duchess of Cambridge's sister to be a worthy partner.

'It was real good because she could move,' he said.

Pippa Middleton danced the night away at a hoedown in the Mid West. Swing-dance cowboy Chris Koch said he was usually 'more impressed with a good horse', but admitted  the Duchess of Cambridge's sister moved well

Wearing a  flannel shirt, jeans and cowboy boots, she was filmed throwing some serious shapes at Jackson Hole's Wort Hotel Silver Dollar Bar on Wednesday evening.

Pippa performed a routine which involved some twirling and sashaying with an elderly gent in a cowboy hat before going on to have a drink at the bar.

Excited locals in Jackson Hole posted pictures of Miss Middleton dancing to  local bluegrass group all over social media this week.

The freelance columnist is thought to be in the Mid-West on a 'test shoot' for U.S. network NBC, which is considering hiring her as a correspondent on The Today Show.

Kris Allison, another one of Miss Middleton's dance partners said: 'BJ Reed took this video of Pippa and I dancing just after the Today Show finished filming her first dance with Chris Koch. It was another fun night at The Silver Dollar Bar here in Jackson.'

Another local at the bar, David Henneberry, said: 'I happened to be there. She is very attractive and it was a blast to watch her having Fun, Smiling and dancing to her hearts content! Very pleasant too.'

Emily hash-tagged one video clip with 'pippamiddleton' before saying that she had told the 31-year-old she was happy she visited, and received a gracious smile as a reply. 

Another person at the bar, Wyomingsith, remarked that she was 'moving quickly' and had only stayed for around ten minutes.

According to the Daily News, the freelance columnist is hoping for a deal 'upward of $500,000' to report on lifestyle and health issues for NBC. 

Pippa has been in talks with the 'peacock network' for a new job after she was interview by Matt Lauer this summer, People confirmed today.  

NBC News previously denied that a deal was in the works but the network has reportedly been in serious talks with Pippa for months about becoming a lifestyle and health correspondent. 

Pippa was spotted leaving Jackson Hole airport in Wyoming today, but it is not yet clear whether she signed a deal with the  NBC show. 

She had been shopping for gifts and a teddy bear, possibly for her nephew Prince George, was peeking out of her bag.

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister was spotted twirling on the dance floor for TV cameras. She has apparently been in talks for months with NBC to come on board as a lifestyle and health correspondent

Pippa first piqued NBC's interest in June when her interview, where she chatted over tea about her sister and Prince George, brought in high ratings for the network.

It is expected that Ms Middleton, a former party planner and cookbook author who has been writing occasional columns about sports and lifestyle, will continue to focus on these subjects in her new role.

NBC has declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.

It is highly unlikely that Prince William's sister-in-law would report on the Royal Family as the subject is deemed off-limits.
