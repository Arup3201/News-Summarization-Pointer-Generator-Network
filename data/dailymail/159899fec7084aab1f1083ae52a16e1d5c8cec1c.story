Bradley Manning, the American soldier accused of leaking US military secrets to Wikileaks, made his first public appearance on Tuesday in over two years as he appeared at a Maryland courthouse.

The informant is expected to testify at some point during the week-long pre-trial hearing where the conditions of his prison treatment are at issue.

Though he did not speak on Tuesday, the first day of the hearing, the 24-year-old private is expected to tell how he was tortured during his nine months in custody at Quantico naval base in Virginia.

On Wednesday, Marine Colonel Robert Oltman testified that Manning was kept tightly confined partly because another prisoner had recently committed suicide.

He was locked up alone in a small cell during this time and had to sleep naked for several nights.

Oltman said the suicide of another 
detainee after his custody status was reduced made Oltman skeptical 
about a psychiatrist's recommendation to ease Manning's confinement 
conditions.

The Marine officer said he told 
medical staffers that Manning should remain in highly restrictive 
confinement unless senior officers decided otherwise.

'Nothing's going to change,' Oltman 
testified. 'He won't be able to hurt himself. He's not going to be able 
to get away, and our way of ensuring this is that he will remain on this
status indefinitely.'

Manning was later moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was re-evaluated and given a medium-security classification.

Supporters of the Army private, now 
24, again filled the courtroom on the second day of what is expected to 
be a six-day hearing.

Manning faces possible life imprisonment if convicted of aiding the enemy, the most serious of the 22 charges that he faces.

His day in court: Manning makes his first appearance as part of a pre-trial hearing

His speech will be a significant and poignant milestone in the story of the Wikileaks cables, which was dubbed a ‘diplomatic 9/11’ for the US.

If a judge rules he was tortured then the entire trial could be abandoned, though that is not expected to happen.

Manning is accused of sending hundreds of thousands of classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks while he was working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010.

He faces possible life imprisonment if convicted of aiding the enemy, the most serious of the 22 charges in the incident.

Hot topics: Manning didn't testify on Tuesday, but he is expected to at some point this week

Conditions: The subject of the hearing is to determine whether he was mistreated while in prison

Manning, who is being held at Fort 
Meade military base in Maryland, was expected to speak about his time in
Quantico naval base between July 2010 and April 2011.

The defense is seeking testimony from an officer whose command included the Marine Corps brig in Virginia where Manning was held for those nine months.

He was kept in highly restrictive, maximum custody and "prevention of injury" status.

The former installation commander, retired Colonel Daniel Choike testified Tuesday that brig commanders refused to ease Manning's confinement conditions as recommended by psychiatrists.

Manning faces a possible life sentence if convicted of aiding the enemy.

A string of supporters including Amnesty have all attacked the way he was treated and claimed that he was tortured.

A
United Nations investigator called the conditions of Manning's time at 
Quantico cruel, inhuman and degrading but stopped short of calling it 
torture.

Controversial: Supporters stood outside the Maryland military courthouse where he was due to appear Tuesday

Make or break: If a judge rules he was tortured then the entire trial could be abandoned, though that is not expected to happen

Jeff Paterson of the Bradley Manning 
support network said: ‘Until now we've only heard from Bradley through 
his family and lawyers, so it's going to be a real insight into his 
personality to hear him speak for himself for the first time.’

Manning’s full hearing is expected to take place on February 4 next year.

He has already indicated that he will plead guilty to some charges, possibly in exchange for a lighter sentence.

The
Wikileaks cables have been described as the biggest leak of classified 
documents in history - which caused shockwaves around the world.

Among
the embarrassing claims was a blunt assessment of David Cameron by 
President Barack Obama, who thought he was a ‘lightweight’.

The President also dismissed Chancellor George Osborne and said that he ‘lacked depth’.

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is currently hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London because he fears the US government will try to extradite him if he leaves.

He is wanted in Sweden on sex assault charges but claims he would be taken from there to America to face trial over the leaking of the cables.
