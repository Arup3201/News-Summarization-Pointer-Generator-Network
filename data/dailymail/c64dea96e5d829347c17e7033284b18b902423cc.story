Doctors have enjoyed pay rises of up to three times the rate of inflation despite the public sector pay freeze, it was revealed yesterday.

NHS Employers, the body which negotiates salaries with the unions, said the earnings of individual doctors had gone up by between three and eight per cent a year since 2010.

They said if doctors’ pay was increased next year, it may put patient care at risk because savings would have to come from the front line.

Doctors have enjoyed pay rises of up to three times the rate of inflation, despite the public sector pay freeze

Doctors’ pay rises over the past two years – which compare with an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent – come mainly as a result of stipulations built into their contracts.

Even though there is meant to be a pay freeze, what this means in practice is that staff are not allowed to move to a higher pay band.

But they still get specified ‘incremental’ increases within their pay band, simply for continuing to do the same job.

It means that a typical new consultant appointed in 2010 on £81,954 would now be earning £89,652 – an increase of 9 per cent. The figures do not include the salaries of GPs, who are effectively self-employed.

NHS Employers used the revelation to argue that the pay for doctors should be ‘frozen’ for the third year in a row. The body told the Doctors’ and Dentists’ Review Body the move was ‘essential to protect services and minimise job losses’.

NHS Employers said it did not believe increases in national pay rates from April next year were necessary or affordable.

Last week, financial experts warned that monetary pressures on the health service, which has been told to make £20billion in efficiency savings by 2015, will start to bite next April as the two-year public sector pay freeze comes to an end.

The King’s Fund report said an average staff pay increase of 1 per cent would add £400-£500million to NHS expenditure. The NHS Employers submission to the review body said the remuneration package for doctors remained ‘highly competitive’ when pension and non-pay benefits were taken into account.

'If we do increase pay...it will mean less investment for patient services and a greater risk of NHS job losses'

Dean Royles, director, NHS Employers

Dean Royles, director of NHS Employers, said: ‘Everyone, including doctors, knows these are challenging times for us all. The simple truth is that NHS organisations cannot afford an unnecessary increase in doctors’ pay rates over the next year without it impacting on patient care.

‘We understand the frustration felt by many doctors about freezing pay scales, but we know they recognise the financial challenges facing all organisations. Most doctors in the NHS already benefit from annual incremental pay increases and pay progression through training. Any additional increase is unaffordable for the NHS.

'Frustration': The doctors' union said there is already a 'major problem with morale'

‘Sixty-five pence of every NHS pound is spent on staff and they do a tremendous job. We must, however, make sure we get the best possible value for the money we have available to us.’

He added: ‘If we do increase pay, we risk serious consequences for the sustainability of some NHS services and their responsiveness to local needs.

‘It will mean less investment for patient services and a greater risk of NHS job losses.’

The British Medical Association, the trade union for doctors, rejected Mr Royles’s comments. Chairman Dr Mark Porter said: ‘The argument that continuing the freeze on doctors’ pay will help NHS employers maintain quality of care simply does not stand up to scrutiny.

‘There is already a major problem with morale, with doctors at the front line dealing with huge efficiency savings and wholesale NHS reorganisation.

‘Maintaining and improving care in the face of probably the biggest ever financial challenge for the NHS requires a more strategic response than just continuing to cut the terms and conditions of its staff.’
