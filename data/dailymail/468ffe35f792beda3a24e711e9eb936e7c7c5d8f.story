A North Carolina rapper has been blackmailed on Twitter by a crazed fan who threatened to kill his own sister if the musician didn't retweet his message.

Referring to J. Cole's new album, the fan tweeted on Monday night '@JColeNC retweet me and I'll buy Born Sinner. Don't retweet me and I'll kill my lil sister,' and uploaded a photo of a young girl with a gun to her head.

The rapper quickly did as he was told and retweeted the message, obviously feeling uneasy about the sick fan's request.

Sick: Referring to J. Cole's new album, the fan tweeted on Monday night '@JColeNC retweet me and I'll buy Born Sinner. Don't retweet me and I'll kill my lil sister'

The tweet has since been retweeted some 9,000 times.

On Tuesday morning, J. Cole commented on the incident, tweeting: 'Wildest s*** I ever seen on twitter.'

It's hard to tell if the gun is real or where the fan actually lives. The account claims to be out of Saudi Arabia but the individual, seemingly a teen boy, refers to National Basketball League games in earlier tweets, suggesting he is based in the U.S.

Later on Tuesday, the J. Cole fan tried to downplay the incident, claiming the weapon was in fact a BB gun without ammunition.

True to my word: Then later on Tuesday, he posted another picture showing the Born Sinner album with a price tag and the comment 'I'm a man of my word @JColeNC'

'It's a BB gun with no ammo. N***** just wanna be fake mad at something,' he wrote as other users threatened to file a federal complaint with the FBI and report him to Twitter for threatening violence.

When a friend asked if his mother was angry following the incident, he wrote: 'Hahahaha she was in the room with me,' before quickly adding 'she got mad at me though.'

He then tweeted: 'Chief Keef can get away with ordering a hit but I can't point a BB gun at my own sister? Y'all ain't shit.'

The fan later uploaded another picture showing J. Cole's Born Sinner album with a price tag on it and the comment 'I'm a man of my word @JColeNC.'
