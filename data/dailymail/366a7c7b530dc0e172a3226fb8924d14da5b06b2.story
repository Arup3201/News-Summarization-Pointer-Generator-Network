A toddler born with a rare joint condition is able to walk for the first time after wearing 'concrete trousers'.

Harrison Hobson had to wear an unusual double leg cast to fix a condition that caused one of his hips to be permanently dislocated.

For the first six months of his life, the baby’s legs had to be kept in an awkward shape in a harness, before being encased in the ‘concrete trousers’.

Doctors noticed a problem with Harrison’s hips just before his mother Charlotte Hobson, 33, was due to take him home from hospital after his birth

Medics diagnosed the newborn with dysplasia, after his hip joint failed to form properly around the top of his leg, causing his right hip to constantly dislocate.

At just four days old, Harrison was placed in a full body harness that locked his hip into a fixed position.

For nine out of ten dysplasis cases this is enough to solve the problem, but when Harrison’s hip failed to heal, doctors decided to operate placing his legs in a plaster cast at five weeks old.

The procedure was found to have failed a week after it was performed and Harrison had a second more invasive operation and a new cast fitted.

For three and a half months, Mrs Hobson had to deal with the challenge of trying to change, dress and bathe a baby stuck in the unusual cast.

Doctors noticed the problem with Harrison’s hips shortly after his birth. At just four days old, he was placed in a full body harness that kept his hip locked into position, before being fitted with the cast (pictured left) He has now made a full recovery (right)

Mrs Hobson (pictured with husband Jason) was at first apprehensive as to whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast, but they were given advise from dysplasia charity Steps about how to care for their son while he was in his plaster cast

The new mother was at first apprehensive, worrying whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast.

They were advised by dysplasia charity Steps, that they should not pick him up from under his arm pits because the cast was too heavy and instead were taught a new method of carrying their son around.

After Harrison’s cast came off, Mrs Hobson was worried he would take longer than other children to reach the milestones of standing and walking.

But at 14 months old, Harrison took his first steps and now aged two, he is running around like any other boisterous toddler.

Mrs Hobson, from Bristol, said: ‘It was such an unusual cast and it doesn’t look comfortable at all so it was heart-breaking to know that my son had to be stuck like that for so long.

‘It’s not a natural position and as a mum you just don’t want your baby to be in pain.

‘The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle.

Mrs Hobson said: 'The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle. Then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers (pictured). They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him'

‘And then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers. They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him.’

She said her son's diagnosis came as a shock after reading ‘every single parenting book’ when she was pregnant, finding no warning about hip dysplasia.

At first, doctors thought both her son's hips had fallen victim to the condition, before concluding it was just Harrison's right hip was affected.

‘Just before we were due to go home from the hospital, a doctor wiggled his hips around and told me that they were both dislocated,' she said.

‘My husband Jason is a professional rugby
 player and has seen a fair few injuries in his time so I thought it 
would be just a case of clicking them back in.

‘But then they explained to me about hip dysplasia - it was a horrible sinking feeling. You could feel his hip click in and out.’

Mrs Hobson said that it was hard to imagine the cast before it was on her baby.

‘I just had all these questions about whether he was going to be in pain, whether I’d be able to keep him clean and tidy. Would I even be able to find him clothes big enough to fit over the cast?

‘But with all the help from Steps we managed to deal with the “concrete trousers” situation and people were only sympathetic when we explained what was wrong.

‘Once he finally got out of his cast it was such a feeling of relief. Now you’d never know that he’d ever had a problem.’

Tim McLachlan, CEO of Steps said: ‘Steps receives calls from parents across the UK who are upset at being asked by strangers “how did you manage to break both their legs?” referring to their toddler who is in a hip spica cast from waist to ankles.

‘Hip dysplasia is a common condition, but not common knowledge and we need to change this.

‘Developmental dysplasia of the hip affects one to three per cent of all births in the UK regardless of background - that’s up to 24,000 children per year or an entire class in an every average secondary school.

‘It’s more than the number of new diagnoses of leukaemia and skin cancer combined.’
