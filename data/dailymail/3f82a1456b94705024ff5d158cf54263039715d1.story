San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been named in a police report by a woman who claims she blacked out after smoking marijuana and drinking in his company.

Miami police are looking into the 'suspicious incident' after the unnamed woman said she kissed Kaepernick and later woke up in hospital without any memory of what had happened the night before.

Earlier reports said that Kaepernick, 26, was being investigated for possible sexual assault, but the police report does not allege any specific crimes and no charges have been filed.

The woman said she visited Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette, 27, at an apartment in the Viceroy, a luxury hotel that has rooms and residences, and he was there with Kaepernick and 49ers wide receiver Quinton Patton, 23, according to a police report.

The possible incident allegedly occurred in Miami, where Kaepernick, pictured in February, is training

The report notes that she had a 'sexual relationship with Mr. Kaepernick in the past'.

After
 mixing some drinks for the men and giving them shots, they allegedly 
told her that for them to take the shots, she had to smoke marijuana.

They
 all started watching a basketball game but the woman said that she went
 to a bedroom to lie down after feeling 'light headed', according to the
 report.

Kaepernick 
then came into the bedroom and kissed her and undressed her, leaving her
 naked - before walking out and saying he would return.

Friends: Ricardo Lockette, right with Kaepernick left, was also at the hotel the night of the incident

She was waiting in bed naked when the two other players peeked inside the room, the report said.

'What are you doing?' she shouted at them, according to the report. 'Where is Colin? Get out!'

The men then left - and she cannot remember what happened after that, she said.

But
 she woke up in a hospital bed in the middle of the night and 'doesn't 
remember how she got there or who transported her to the hospital', the 
report said.

'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault,' a police spokesperson said of the report. 'This report is simply an incident report taken at the woman's request.'

According to Kapernick's Instagram 
account, he is in Miami to train and has been to the Viceroy Hotel as 
recently as April 5, where he was pictured hanging out with a wedding 
party by the pool.

Kaepernick,
 who has previously been rumored to be dating 23-year-old singer and 
actress Teyana Taylor, is up for a possible contract extension this 
summer.

'The 49ers organization is aware of 
the recent media report regarding Colin Kaepernick and is in the process
 of gathering the pertinent facts,' the team said in a statment said.

Over
 the past two seasons, he has played with the 49ers in the Super Bowl 
and the NFC Championship game - although the team lost both.
