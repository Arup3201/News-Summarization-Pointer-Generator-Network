British Airways and easyJet planes were forced to abort landings at Leeds Bradford Airport at the last minute due to high winds.

Amazing footage has emerged showing the aircraft battling against strong winds in an attempt to land, before pulling up at the last moment.

The BA flight, which had flown from Heathrow to Leeds, attempted to land at about 2.30pm on Thursday, but was forced to divert to Manchester Airport due to the difficult weather conditions.

Wind speeds around what is the highest airport in England had reached up to 60mph earlier in the day.

Two videos  show the planes swaying from side to side as the pilots attempts to land. The wings on both aircrafts are seen dipping dramatically.

As they near the ground, the decision is clearly made to abort the landings and the planes pull back up into the sky.

The Briths Airways aircraft eventually diverted to Manchester Airport and passengers were shuttled back to Leeds by coach.

Tony Hallwood, spokesperson fro Leeds Bradford Airport, told MailOnline: 'Unfortunately due to high winds, with gusts reaching up to 60 miles per hour, there were a number of delays and a small number of cancellations in during the day.

'The whole of Yorkshire was one of the most seriously affected locations in the UK, which impacted the airport fro about nine hours.'

High winds have continued to affect flights in the UK, with British Airways tweeting this morning: 'It's windy at London Heathrow, Gatwick & City today. Check your flight status here.'

The flight diversion at Leeds came as Stansted Airport in Essex battled its own problems.

A power outage caused minor delays to flights, although the airport confirmed neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and that passengers were being taken by bus to their flights. 

About four million Britons are heading overseas during this festive period, estimated the travel association Abta, a slight increase on last year.

Heathrow is the busiest British departure point with almost 700,000 passengers leaving between December 19 and Christmas Day.

Gatwick is expecting more than 1.7 million passengers to travel through the airport between December 19 and January 5. 

MailOnline has contacted British Airways for comment.
