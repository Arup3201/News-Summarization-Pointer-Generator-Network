Britain will call for a new United Nations Security Council resolution to remove Syria's president Bashar al-Assad using the rules that led to wars in Libya and Iraq.

Foreign Secretary William Hague announced yesterday that the UK wants to introduce a motion under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which can approve the use of force.

British diplomats say they will only threaten sanctions, rather than military action. But the move will be seen as a ratcheting up of pressure on both the Syrian regime and Russia, which has given Assad diplomatic protection.

The resolution likely to be introduced next week by Britain and France will be aimed at introducing international sanctions, an arms embargo and worldwide travel bans unless the regime in Syria implements a peace plan drawn up by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan.

Up to 100 people are still being slaughtered each day in Syria as the Assad regime hits back against opposition forces, who have ended the dictator's dominance in key parts of the country.

Mr Hague said yesterday: 'Countries like the United Kingdom will be seeking a Chapter VII resolution at the UN Security Council to mandate the implementation of the Annan plan, and threaten consequences for those who do not implement it.'

At a meeting in Geneva at the weekend, Russia and China finally signed up to a plan for a transition of power that would lead to a government of national unity, containing elements of the current regime and its opposition.

Russia insists that the deal did not sanction a wholesale regime change â€“ but Britain is adamant that under the agreed terms, Assad would have to go.

Mr Hague said: 'What was in the communique was that a transitional government in Syria should include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups, and be formed on the basis of mutual consent, mutual assent, which means that each side can veto, if they wish, the people from the other side, who would be in a government.

'Of course, that would mean that President Assad could not be part of such a government.'

He added that while sanctions are all that is being sought currently by the UK, military action could follow.

'I don't think we should rule anything out for the future,' he said. 'This is a rapidly deteriorating situation in which many thousands of people have now died, terrible torture is being committed.'

A senior British diplomat said: 'We'll be looking pretty soon to make an assessment of when to move in the council, which I suspect will be pretty quickly. I expect it will be pretty ambitious.

'We want it to be a strong text with clear measures in there to increase the pressure on the regime to respect their obligations. Something which puts the Annan plan and the Geneva plan under Chapter VII and international law would be a very good thing.

'There is much that you can do under Chapter VII Article 41, which specifically rules out the use of force, but which allows coercive non-military measures such as economic sanctions, travel bans and that sort of thing.'

Mr Annan is expected to travel to Damascus to demand cooperation from the regime to a transition of power.
