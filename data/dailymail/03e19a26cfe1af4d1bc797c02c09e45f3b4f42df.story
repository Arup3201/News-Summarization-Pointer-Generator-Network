More than 2,000 Britons who live in the tax haven of Monaco are costing the UK economy £1billion a year in lost revenue, it was claimed last night

Ex-pats living in the principality are free to get honours, fund political parties and run businesses while escaping the taxes that apply to other citizens.

To live in Monaco there are rules set by HM Revenue and Customs that Britons have to meet, including an ability to prove they have made a ‘definite break’ with Britain.

But many wealthy Britons in the tax enclave still hold on to many links to the UK.

More than 500 directors of UK companies have registered addresses in Monaco and control over 1,300 firms, an investigation found.

Restaurant and property tycoon, John De Stefano, 67, who runs 81 companies from the principality, is among them.

And at least 11 people who live in Monaco as tax exiles, or benefit through family members, have been awarded honours.

They include the billionaires Sir Philip Green and Jim McColl OBE. Six Monaco-based Tory donors have made political donations – despite government pledges to close a loophole enabling them to do so.

They include Lord Laidlaw, 69, who gave £5million, and David Instance, 73, a Kent businessman, who provided a helicopter used by David Cameron.

HMRC spokesman David Richardson said 
last night: ‘The Government wants to make sure the rules in our tax 
system are clear, but those on tax residence are currently complicated 
and uncertain.

‘They have built up over time, often based on decisions in the courts, so we are bringing in a residence test that will bring certainty to the minority of people whose tax residence status is not immediately clear.’

Monaco residents – who are not breaking any laws – often reject the term tax exile and say they are only there to enjoy the lifestyle and weather in the principality.

They say they contribute to the British economy by creating jobs and paying corporate tax at source, and they pay 19.6 per cent VAT in Monaco.

HMRC added that it routinely vets would-be honours recipients when the Cabinet Office sends the list to Government departments.

Comedian Jimmy Carr was forced to apologise earlier this year after it was revealed he put his earnings into a Jersey-based tax avoidance scheme called K2, which reduced the income tax liability of participants to as little as one per cent.

Both David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have branded aggressive tax avoidance, like the one used by Mr Carr, as ‘morally repugnant’.

Mr Osborne pledged to clampdown on such schemes during the last budget.
