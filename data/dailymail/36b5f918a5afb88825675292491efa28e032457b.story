An Alabama teenager criticized for taking a smiling selfie during a tour of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp has said she doesn't regret the picture.

Breanna Mitchell defended her actions on TakePart Live on Monday, saying she took the picture in memory of her father, who taught her about the concentration camps.

Criticism of the girl's selfie came during a growing trend of tourists snapping pictures of themselves at memorials, including at Ground Zero in New York.

Defense: Breanna Mitchell says she took her Auschwitz selfie in memory of her father, who shared the teenager's love of history

In Mitchell's case, the teenager said she had made the trip to Auschwitz on the anniversary of her father's death, and had wanted a memento.

'Honestly,
 I don't think I would do anything differently, because I didn't mean 
any harm,' she said, according to Gawker.

'And, like, I told everybody my story behind it, so
 that's the only reason I don't regret taking it.'

The teenager added that she had been shocked by the sudden interest in the picture, and said she had been sent harsh messages and even death threats.

Mitchell isn't the only social media fan to come in for criticism for what is deemed by many to be inappropriate photos.

Some visitors to sacred sites including the memorial where the World Trade Centers used to stand in New York City have also used the trip as a chance for a selfie.

And even President Obama was censured after posing for a picture with British Prime Minister David Cameron, and Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt during a memorial to Nelson Mandela.

Pictures of tourists posing and poking their tongues out during visits to Auschwitz are seen as inappropriate by many

A growing trend in selfies at memorials or sites such as Auschwitz has appeared in recent years

Many have questioned whether sharing smiling pictures at places such as Auschwitz online is appropriate

Among the tourists who have been criticized is an 18-year-old from Florida, who has since defended his 9/11 memorial selfie.

Chris Canning told ABC News he clearly remembered the attacks and wanted the photo to record his visit.

'I don't just want a photo of the 
memorial, I want a picture of myself and the memorial. I wanted to capture a special moment,' he said.

The New York memorial has explicit guidelines for its visitors, reminding them that: 'The Memorial and Memorial Museum are places of solemn reflection dedicated to honoring and remembering the tragic events and the overwhelming loss of innocent life that occurred at this location.'

While it doesn't ban photography - and in some instances encourages visitors to record their trip with a #9/11memorial hashtag - the site's rules state: 'Proper decorum, personal behavior, and conduct is required from all visitors at all times in order to provide the entire visiting public with respect.'

Photos of visitors pouting with the 9/11 memorial behind them have also been criticized

Sites such as the 9/11 memorial in New York attract huge crowds, but many have questioned whether it is right to take pictures there

Despite 
the widespread criticism, some have argued that taking photos at the 
memorial is a way for the public to engage in, and further understand 
the tragedy.

Photography
 critic Susie Linfield said: 'What 9/11 did produce was a lot of citizen
 documentation in the days following the attacks.'

According
 to The Awl, she added: 'These were not photographs of the attacks 
themselves, but depictions of how we as New Yorkers tried not only to 
survive, but also to help each other and to come together to understand 
what was happening.'

The popularity of selfies and social media has led to challenges for what is considered acceptable behavior.

Vermont
 company the Emily Post Institute, which offers advice on etiquette, has
 drawn up new guidelines on how to appropriately combine social media 
with everyday life.

Lizzie Post, the great-great granddaughter of the company's founder, said that when selfies at memorials were fine, as long as they were taken respectfully.

'If you're going to stick your tongue 
out or make a duck face in front of the World Trade Center, I think 
that's probably inappropriate,' she told ABC News.

She added that it was also best to ask an official or staff member if taking photos was considered appropriate.
