She is an expert marksman, hunts with a bow and arrow and can skin a deer, but now Sergeant Theresa Vail has a new mission.

On Tuesday she became the second servicewoman to compete in the Miss America pageant, in a move the 22-year-old says she hopes will empower women.

As well as being the second Army recruit to take part in the Miss America contest, Sergeant Vail also broke down barriers by having her tattoos on show during the bikini round.

The competition's preliminary rounds are
currently taking in place in Atlantic City, where Sergeant Vail is 
strutting her stuff against 52 other competitors.

She told People her desire to empower women by encouraging them to be themselves was behind her reason for baring her tattoos - the insignia for the Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder, and the Serenity Prayer running down her right side.

'My whole platform is empowering women to overcome stereotypes and break barriers,' the 22-year-old, who wants to become an Army dentist, said.

'How can I tell other women to be fearless and true to themselves if I can't do the same? I am who I am, tattoos and all.'

Nine months ago Sergeant Vail had never considered entering a beauty contest, but her commanding officer encouraged her to take part, saying she would be an ideal role model.

'I never thought about it until a mentor, in my unit, explained how the recognition could help with what I want to do as a role model,' she said, according to the Huffington Post.

The former motorbike racer, who stopped racing only after breaking all the fingers in her right hand, had originally planned to show off her archery skills for the talent section.

However, two days before the contest she discovered 'projectile objects' were banned so, despite never sung professionally before, the young woman taught herself Pavarotti's Nessun Dorma in under 48 hours.

'I've worked with five former Miss 
Kansas contestants and I've never seen anyone this focused and 
determined,' Kim Brom, business manager for the Miss Kansas 
pageant. told People.

'She has so many different qualities – she's a hunter, she's in
the military, she's fluent in Chinese, she's very educated and, even 
more than that, she has that unquantifiable star quality.'

Sergeant Vail, who loves the outdoors and claims to have a great recipe for squirrel stew, joined the army when she was 17.

She has just signed up for another six years, as well as staring as a senior at Kansas University, where she is majoring in Chinese and Chemistry. 

'Nobody expects a soldier to be a beauty queen, but I'm all about breaking stereotypes,' Sergeant Vail, who has eight siblings, said.

The only other Army recruit turned beauty queen was Miss Utah in 2007.

Sergeant Vail's main ambition however, is to empower women - a cause close to her after being bullied for years as a child.

And, as her story spreads, her Facebook 
page has been inundated with messages from well-wishers across the 
country, thanking her for being an inspiration to young women.

Around the time Sergeant Vail was suffering from being bullied, she developed her love of the outdoor pursuits, which offered her a chance to escape the taunts and remind her she was a strong person.

On her website she said: 'When girls learn they have what it takes to "hang with the guys" they feel a sense of internal strength, like they can conquer the world and take care of themselves.'
