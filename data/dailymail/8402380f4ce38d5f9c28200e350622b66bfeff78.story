A wall collapsed onto a house full of of Chinese workers, killing 18 of them and injuring three more.

The workers, from the recycling plant in Qingdao, eastern China, had taken shelter in the house to escape heavy rain, according to state media.

But the storm was so fierce that it waterlogged the ground around the house, causing a nearby wall, which was holding back tonnes of earth, to collapse on top of it.
