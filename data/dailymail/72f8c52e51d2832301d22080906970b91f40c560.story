It has now been revealed that Miami Dolphins' Richie Incognito last year faced allegations of molesting a woman at a charity golf tournament and dumping water on her head.

The maligned lineman was accused of molesting a female volunteer with a golf club during a team-sponsored charity golf tournament last year, according to reports.

The harassment allegation became public after WPLG obtained a copy of the police report filed May 18, 2012 by the 34-year-old woman.

Mr Incognito’s lewd behaviour occurred during the annual Fins Weekend Golf Tournament at the Turnberry Resort and Club, the incident report said.

The woman accused the footballer of using a golf club to rub her privates and knock her glasses off her head, a copy of the report reviewed by MailOnline alleges.

The woman said Mr Incognito had been drinking during the event.

‘After that, he proceeded to lean up against her buttocks with his private parts as if dancing, saying ‘Let it rain, Let it Rain!’ The report said.

‘He finally finished his inappropriate behavior by emptying bottled water in her face,’ said the report.The woman told cops arriving on the scene that several people saw the inappropriate behaviour and did nothing to stop it.

Had Mr Incognito simply apologized, it does not appear she would have filed the report.

Instead, ‘she felt like he didn't care and thought the whole incident was in fun and games,’ the report reads. ‘Other people apologized for him, but not him.’

Dolphins team security said they would handle the issue when it was brought to their attention, but the woman told authorities nothing was done.

The woman is not allowed to speak publicly about the incident after signing a confidentiality agreement, according to WPLG.

The golf outing accusation is the third in a series of shocking stories involving the previously under-the-radar football player.

Last month, a series of voicemails left for teammate Jonathan Martin emerged that showed Mr Incognito using racial slurs and threatening physical violence against him.

Mr Incognito was suspended indefinitely from the team while an investigation is carried out.

Mr Martin has since left the team to seek counseling, and accused unspecified teammates of threatening to rape his sister.

Martin says he was harassed daily, and Incognito acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap Martin's mother

In the time since his suspension, Mr Incognito has told those close to him that he feels betrayed by Mr Martin, a rookie that other Dolphins have publicly said the veteran took under his wing.

A source told ESPN the allegations 'shocked' Mr Incognito, and that he feels betrayed.

'It's probably a combination of totally blindsided and a bit betrayed,' the source told the network. 'He's shocked. He can't believe this happened and thinks it probably could have been avoided.'

To his credit, several teammates have spoken out in favor of Mr Incognito, and also said many of the comments were taken out of context.

'I don't think what happened is necessary,' teammate Tyson Clabo told ESPN. 'I don't know why he's doing this. And the only person who knows why is Jonathan Martin.'

Just this past week, a video emerged of an out-of-control, drunk, shirtless Mr Incognito rampaging through a bar shouting the n-word as terrified patrons dove for cover.

The team has not publicly commented on the two latest incidents.
