Convicted killer Joran Van der Sloot broke down in tears and clutched his young bride's hand, pleading: 'Help me, please help me.' 

The once-swaggering Dutchman recently went on a hunger strike after he was moved from a relaxed jail to one of the most notorious prisons in Peru. He claims it is 'worse than Guantanamo Bay' and that he and other inmates are beaten.

And in an interview with MailOnline his pregnant wife, Leidy Figueroa, 25, said he is close to the breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions.

Many would find it hard to conjure up a scrap of sympathy for Van der Sloot after he was transferred to the feared Challapalca prison four weeks ago. The killer - serving 28 years for murdering a Peruvian student in 2010 - remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of 18-year-old American high school graduate Natalee Holloway in Aruba.

Depressed: Van der Sloot's pregnant wife told MailOnline that hels 'been beaten by the guards and lost weight'

Since his arrival at the jail, which sits at an altitude of 16,000 ft in a remote mountainous area of southern Peru, Van der Sloot's physical condition has deteriorated. 

Leidy, who is nine months pregnant with his daughter, fears he could die. She said: 'It makes me sad to see him like that, he's in very bad condition, he has been beaten by the guards and has lost a lot of weight and is very depressed, I am scared he will die in there.'

After her last visit three weeks ago, Van der Sloot handed Leidy a scrawled letter and asked her to sneak it out of the prison and hand it to the Dutch Embassy.

The letter, written in Dutch, is a cry for help asking the Dutch authorities to intervene and remove him from the 'inhumane' conditions at the prison.

The handwriting is scruffy and disjointed – different to the neat love letters he would write to Leidy from his last jail. 

It reads: 'Help please. I am not allowed to have pen or paper, nothing. They beat us. There is no light, nothing... no pen and paper, help please.'

It adds: 'Holland, please help. This is worse than Guantanamo. It is 5000m high, there is no light and no water, we are locked up 24 hours. It is cold, have no clothes and they are beating us.'

Leidy added: 'When I saw him he cried in my arms, and he asked me to help him, I held him and we prayed.'

The prison's conditions are in stark contrast to those under which Van der Sloot fell in love with Leidy in an unlikely prison romance four years ago.

The couple were even allowed to marry behind bars earlier this summer.

Lax prison rules also meant he was able to play online poker, use a cellphone, take drugs and have other women come and go as he pleased. And he enjoyed teaching English to other inmates and doing arts and crafts. 

Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca after he threatened to kill the warden of the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Lima. 

He was found with an illegal cellphone which was confiscated, officials of the Inpe prisons administration said. 

Van der Sloot even recorded a video in which he showed the conditions in his cell, later saying that it was warden Sergio Haro who provided him with the cellphone. 

Privileges: Leidy said that Van der Sloot can't make the ceramic art he's been sending her at the new jail

Fears: Leidy, who is due to have Van der Sloot's child any day now said that the killer has been told he'll never see his baby daughter after she is born now he's been moved to maximum security jail 16,000ft up in the Andes

'The warden himself gave it to me. I don't know why, but I suspect that it was to set a trap for me,' said Van der Sloot in a portion of the video. 

According to Leidy, Warden Haro was furious and told her husband he had never liked him. Van der Sloot was immediately thrown in the 'Hole' – solitary confinement – for six days. 

Leidy said: 'When he came out of the Hole the warden told Joran that he won't see his baby daughter when she's born. Joran didn't believe him but the warden is true to his word.' 

Weeks later Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca prison on August 23.

'I can't take our daughter to see him because it is so far and there is little oxygen which would make it very difficult for my baby to breath,' explained a distraught Leidy, speaking at her apartment in Lima.

'Now he is going to be a father he really wants to see his daughter, but he knows he can't and he is suffering a lot. People may say Joran deserves that and that he's a monster - but he has feelings.

'I believe this is God’s way of testing us, I have not been able to sleep.'

Since Van der Sloot's transfer, visiting her husband has become very difficult for Leidy.

Challapalca is in the Andes near the Bolivian border, about 211 kilometers from the nearest city of Puno - a six-hour ride down a dirt road, depending on conditions, according to a 2003 report on the facility by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

The jail - known to house problem prisoners - is feared by criminals across Peru for its harsh regime and grinding conditions. It has been the focus of many investigations for human rights abuses.

There is no regular electricity or running water, and temperatures most of the year hover around 33 degrees Fahrenheit in the day and as low as 20 degrees below zero at night. He and Leidy are no longer able to enjoy conjugal visits either. 

Harsh: The Challapalca prison is often cited in international human rights reports. It has no regular electricity or running water and temperatures hover around 33F most of the yera and -20F at night

Prime suspect: Van der Sloot gained notoriety when he became the prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway (left) in 2005. He hasn't been charged over her disappearance. But he was sentenced to 28 years in hail for strangling a Peruvian student, Stephany Flores, to death in 2010

Leidy, 25, said: 'There is no water, no electricity. There is no rehabilitation for Joran, no doctor no clinic. A doctor comes once every 15 days, that's it. There’s no internet like in the old prison, no workshops, so he can't paint or make his ceramics, that makes him very depressed.

'The guards are brutal and regularly beat the prisoners. I've heard some inmates have been beaten to death and their autopsy will say natural causes, I fear for Joran’s life.'

Leidy said her husband's physical condition is very poor and his body bears the marks of a recent savage beating.

'When I saw him his body and back were badly bruised, his face and nose swollen, his trousers and his shoes were ripped and he was dirty,' she explained. 'He says the food is horrible and when I visit he is kept in chains.

'Before he arrived he knew the conditions would be bad, but he wasn't prepared for this nightmare.

'Joran told me he is in bad shape and asked me to help him, he asked me to get him out of there. He is very depressed and he was crying in my arms. We held each other and prayed, I am so upset for him.'

The length of Van der Sloot's stay in Challapalca will depend on his behavior, Inpe officials said.

If he behaves properly he could be transferred soon to another prison with better accommodations, such as are available at the cushy Piedras Gordas. 

Tears welling up in her eyes Leidy says that only God can now help her husband.

'It makes me feel bad that Joran is so depressed. I going to church a lot asking God to help me because he’s the only one who can make a difference. I once said to Joran, "Everything we do we pay the consequences."

'I know he has killed, but you pay for what you do and living in this hell-hole is God's punishment.

'Of course I understand what he did was wrong. I am a mother, I wouldn't want to lose a child and go through what Stephany Flores' parents went through.

'But I know in my heart Joran has changed. People who know him can see the difference, we are all human beings. God blessed us with a wedding and a daughter.

'He will always have me and will always have a daughter who loves him. All we have left is to fight through this struggle. My Joran is not a monster and I have forgiven him.'

Leidy is confident that one day she and Van der Sloot will be together properly. 'Somehow one day he’s going to leave prison and we can be a family,' she said.

Strip search: Footage emerged of Van der Sloot being patted down when he was transferred to the new jail

However, Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Natalee Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for $25,000 payment.

The murderer was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba.

No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved.

In 2010, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance.
