Drama student Miss Ellery, 20, said her boyfriend of one year died in her arms as she prayed for him to live

Miss Ellery has told of the moment her boyfriend of one year died in her arms as she prayed for him to live.

She told MailOnline: ‘He crossed the road to speak to a friend and didn’t see the car

‘I was quite far away. I wasn’t sure if it was him.

'I started running and calling his name – hoping he was in the crowd of people running with me.

‘And then I realised it was him.

‘I lay next to him and I asked him to stay with me and stay strong. I saw him die in front of me.’ 

The pair met while on a night out a year ago. She said she was instantly attracted to Mr Mallet's eyes and his 'incredible dancing.'

She said: 'On our first date he said I was his girlfriend and would never let me go. I loved him with every part of me and I cannot believe he's gone.

'He told me he would follow me anywhere. He never wanted to let me go. We were going to be together forever. He asked me to marry him, and apologised that he didn't have enough money to buy me a ring.

'I am very close to his family. His mother called me and kept thanking me for making her son the happiest man on earth

‘He was the best person ever. The best thing that ever happened to me, the most precious person I have ever met in my life. 

'Everyone has such love for him - no-one had anything bad to say about him.' 

Mr Mallet was from Normandy, France, but moved to London four years ago. His girlfriend said the couple had been planning to move back to France or to America once she had graduated. 

Friends who were out with Mr Mallet at Trapeze Bar in Great Eastern Street said he was not drunk. 

A Scotland Yard spokesman said police were called by London Ambulance at 2.06am on Monday to Great Eastern Street following reports of a collision between a car and a male pedestrian.

A spokesman added: 'London Fire Brigade and London's Air Ambulance also attended. The man was pronounced dead at the scene at 2.20am.'

No arrests have been made and police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Sketch paid tribute to Mr Mallet and said staff were 'devastated' by his death.

Sinead Mallozzi, sketch CEO, told MailOnline: 'Naturally we are all devastated at the loss of a much loved and respected member of the sketch family - Hubert worked at sketch for four years and his passing will change our lives irrecoverably. 

'Our priority now is to ensure that the team receive the appropriate counselling and care that is required during this terribly sad time.'
