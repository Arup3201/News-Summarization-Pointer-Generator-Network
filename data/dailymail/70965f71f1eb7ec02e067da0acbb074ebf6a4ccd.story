Furious Swansea boss Garry Monk accused Stoke winger Victor Moses and referee Michael Oliver of cheating his team after a controversial penalty decision at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday.

Monk, who now faces an FA disciplinary charge, called for Moses to be punished for diving. The Swansea boss added that if he had ‘dived’ in that manner he would have been too ashamed to face his own family.

But when Moses tumbled in the penalty area shortly before the break Oliver was convinced and awarded his second spot-kick of the match. The 29-year-old Northumberland official had earlier upset Stoke by penalising Ryan Shawcross for impeding Wilfried Bony at a corner, and the debate completely overshadowed Jonathan Walters’ 76th-minute winner.

It is true Moses appeared to go down under minimal contact from defender Angel Rangel, allowing Charlie Adam to cancel out Bony’s penalty.

‘He should be punished for diving,’ said Monk. ‘It’s a clear dive, which is cheating. He’s cheated the ref and then the ref’s cheated us.

‘It’s one of the most blatant dives you’ll ever see. You go and watch a million games and you won’t see more of a dive than that. He should be ashamed of himself. I wouldn’t be able to go home to my family and show my face. This is how I live my life. They can do what they want, but for me it’s a disgrace.

‘There was absolute minimal contact with Rangel. (Moses) has thrown himself to the floor. It is more laughable every time I watch it. It’s very hard to take when it’s so blatant and you see him being rewarded for it.

‘Anyone who simulates in training (at Swansea) is fined. I wouldn’t have it. If my player did that he wouldn’t play in the next game. The referee has taken the easy option to give the penalty. It’s a massive game-changing moment, and a disgusting decision. He’s the only guy in the whole stadium that thought that was a clear-cut penalty. I looked straight at their bench and even they couldn’t believe he’d given it. That tells you everything.’

Monk also hit out at referees’ chief Mike Riley for failing to respond to his concerns over decisions he feels have gone against Swansea this season.

He said that the club had already gone over Riley’s head before yesterday’s game by sending a letter and DVD of some of the incidents to John Williams, chairman of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, last week. ‘I haven’t had anything back from Mike Riley which is astonishing to me and poor leadership,’ he added.

‘His job is to ring me, my job is not to ring him. He’s supposed to be the head of these guys.

‘We’ve sent off a DVD with a letter, (expressing) my disappointment at no contact from Mike Riley. I think it’s about being proactive, but he’s clearly not proactive, so I have to go above him and hopefully that will send the right message and I can get the right answers.’

Stoke manager Mark Hughes was quick to defend Moses and said that Monk, the Premier League’s youngest manager at 35, had showed a lack of experience with his outburst. 

‘It’s a situation that he needs to learn from,’ said Hughes. ‘He is disappointed but the longer you’re in this game, the more experience you get and sometimes you have to curb what you really feel.

‘There was no need for that from my point of view. I don’t think he (Moses) dived. I think he felt contact. He was running at pace between two defenders and the onus is on the defender not to go anywhere near him.

‘From the angle I’ve seen, there’s a definite movement from Rangel to put his arm across Victor and knock him off his stride. It’s a soft one and you can argue about it as much as you like. He gave it and that’s the end of it.’ 

While Monk claimed that Shawcross dragging Bony to the ground was a clear penalty, Hughes is concerned that his captain’s reputation counted against him. ‘For whatever reason, people are trying to highlight Ryan over most defenders in terms of him being more adept at holding people in the box, which is pure nonsense,’ said Hughes.

‘Maybe the referee had seen a bit of the media coverage. Every time there’s a corner against us the cameras go straight to Ryan. The referee will have done his pre-match work and maybe it’s been highlighted to him.’

Amid the controversy, Walters’ winner was almost forgotten after he headed in a cross from Oussama Assaidi, another Stoke substitute. Victory lifted Stoke up to 10th place, level on points with Swansea. So what did Walters make of it all? ‘I think because he gave the first one, he’s given the second one,’ he said with a smile.
