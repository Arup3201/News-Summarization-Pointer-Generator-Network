Former Republic of Ireland midfielder and Sportsmail columnist demonstrated the perks of working at a World Cup on Saturday, when he posted a picture with a stunning woman in a Colombian shirt.

Kilbane was at Colombia's Group C clash with Greece commentating for BBC One.

The former Everton winger met the blond woman, thought to be another sports journalist, at the game in Belo Horizonte before posting a picture of the two of them to twitter.

Playing days: Kilbane won over 100 caps for the Republic of Ireland and played at the 2002 World Cup

'Great game in Belo Horizonte this afternoon,' Kilbane wrote on the social networking site.

'I am now following #col for the 'WorldCup2014 wonder why! #COLvGRE.'

Colombia won the game 3-0 and are top of the Group C table. They meet Ivory Coast in their second game on Thursday knowing that a win would all but confirm their progress into the last 16.
