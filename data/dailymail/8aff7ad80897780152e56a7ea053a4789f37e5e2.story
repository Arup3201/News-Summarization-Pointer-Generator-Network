A Washington, D.C. middle school teacher angered parents after sending home with an assignment, asking students to compare and contrast Adolf Hitler to former President George W Bush.

After at least one parent complained to the McKinley Middle School administrators, and now the unnamed teacher will be forced to apologize to the sixth-graders for the controversial piece of homework.

According to a copy of the assignment released to the media, the teacher asked the students to write the similarities and differences between the two leaders in a Venn diagram, based on what they had read in two different texts. The class had been studying both the Holocaust and the Iraq War.

A Washington, D.C. middle-school teacher sent students home with this assignment, asking them to compare and contrast Adolf Hitler to George W Bush in a Venn diagram 

Sorry: The McKinley Middle School teacher is now apologizing to his class for the assignment, after at least one parent complained 

'Now that we have read about two men of power who abused their power in various ways, we will compare and contrast them and their actions.

'Please refer to your texts, "Fighting Hitler — A Holocaust Story" and "Bush: Iraq War Justified Despite No WMD" to compare and contrast former President George W. Bush and Hitler. We will use this in class tomorrow for an activity!' the homework instructions read. 

One parent told the Washington Times says the assignment presents an opinion about Bush's presidency as fact and also shows a lack of respect for the presidency.

Outrage: One parent said the assignment presents an opinion about Bush as fact, and also shows a lack of respect for the presidency. The class had been studying the Iraq War and the Holocaust.

'I think trying to compare Adolf Hitler to an America president is just not right,' the parent said. 'I didn’t agree with Mr Bush or his policies, but that was over the line.'

When the parent called to complain, they were told that the assignment was part of a curriculum unit approved by the school system.

But the D.C. Public Schools has since issued a statement, condemning the teacher's actions.

Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson tweeted: 'Do DCPS says to make these comparisons in any way. A deeply apologetic teacher used poor judgement and will apologize to students'

The school district released a full statement, saying the teacher planned to apologize to students in class on Thursday and will be sending home a letter to parents explaining the issue.

'The teacher deeply regrets this mistake, and any suggestion to malign the presidency or make any comparison in this egregious way. The teacher admits to extremely poor judgement and short sightedness and will apologize to students,' the statement reads.
