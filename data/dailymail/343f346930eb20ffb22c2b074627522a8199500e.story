A New Jersey camel with an uncanny knack for picking winning NFL teams has died just two and a half weeks before her home state hosts the Super Bowl.

Princess, a Bactrian camel, was a popular attraction at Popcorn Park Zoo where, for ten years, she had gained a reputation for her prognosticating skills.

Sadly the 26-year-old, who used Graham crackers to make her team selections, was suffering from arthritis and had to be euthanized on Wednesday because she was no longer able to stand.

Princess, said to be a New York Giants fan, began her illustrious career when a radio station appealed for animals to try select the winning Super Bowl team.

Princess is not the only animal famed for having prognosticating sports skills.

Paul the psychic octopus, from Germany, correctly guessed the outcome in seven of his team's games in the 2010 World Cup, as well as eventual winner, Spain.

Chaco the screaming hairy armadillo, from Virginia, correctly predicted Baltimore Ravens would be the 2013 Super Bowl winner.

Mr Nuts, a California cat, has an unbroken record for picking Super Bowl winners. He marks out his prediction by using a litter tray bearing the logo of what will be the losing team.

Sonny, a New Zealand sheep, predicted a string of victories for the All Blacks in the rugby World Cup.

'She was a natural. We just used some Graham crackers,' zoo manager John Bergmann told Asbury Park Press.

To help the camel choose, Mr Bergmann would write the team names on his palms and then cover the writing with a cracker.

Whichever cracker Princess went for would become her winning team.

She had a strong track record for accuracy, picking six out of seven Super Bowl winners.

Her prediction last year, for the Baltimore Ravens, was correct and in 2008 she had a spectacular run, selecting 17 out of 22 NFL games correctly, including that year's Super Bowl winners the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Princess, who 'never met a Graham 
cracker she didn't like' was gearing up to make her pick for 
the February 2 Super Bowl.Â 

She had made selections in all this season's games, up to the playoff between the San Diego Chargers and Denver Broncos.

Team spirit: Princess, the 26-year-old camel, was famed for her NFL predictions

'Her absence leaves a big void in the park. It was not just her size, but her personality, and to not have her here leaves a big hole,' Mr Bergmann told NBC Philadelphia.

Princess, a former pet of tobacco heiress Doris Duke, moved to the park after her owner died in 1993, and quickly became a loved attraction there.

A Facebook page for the 'prognosticator extraordinaire' has been filled with tributes from fans around the world.
