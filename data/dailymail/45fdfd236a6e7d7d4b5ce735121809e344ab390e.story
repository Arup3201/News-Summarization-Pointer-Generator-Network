For Elle Watmough, it would be an understatement to say the prospect of having a child with the love of her life is exciting.

But the 25-year-old, who began trying for a baby through IVF since she became engaged to NRL player Anthony Watmough nearly four years ago, has been enduring years of physical and emotional pain.

Having kept her struggles private for the past few years, the former model and her husband who live in Dee Why - northern Sydney - made the decision to share their story on a blog on Friday.

While it was difficult to reveal some of the intimate details of her personal life, Mrs Watmough told Daily Mail Australia her aim isn't to gain sympathy nor to shed negative light on IVF.

Instead she wants to urge women to educate themselves about their own health and body as she found out the hard way that not all medical professionals are accurate with their prognosis.

But the 25-year-old has revealed that she's endured years of pain whilst trying to fall pregnant

Mrs Watmough recounted the troubling moments she underwent during the IVF process, including when she found out she had endometriosis - a hormonal and immune system disease with symptoms such as painful periods and reduced fertility.

Endometriosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease. It occurs when cells from the Endometrium (uterus) migrate to the pelvic cavity, causing lesions and inflammation.

Endometriosis can also attach to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowel, bladder and other organs.

The symptoms of endometriosis include:

Many women think that painful periods are normal. If you have bad period pain, you should see your doctor and mention the possibility of endometriosis.

Not all women experience typical symptoms of endometriosis. They may not discover it until it has already damaged their reproductive organs.

Endometriosis is one of the three leading causes of infertility in women. 

'I cried. I even screamed. I told my doctors it was my body and I knew something wasn't right. I was told I had "unexplained infertility",' Mrs Watmough wrote on her blog.

'They couldn't find anything that was wrong with myself or my husband. Every time my doctor called to speak to me after a failed cycle, she told me she was "baffled". For some unknown reason it just wasn't working and not even the doctors could tell us why. I was told to be patient.

'I was FINALLY admitted into surgery at North Shore Private Hospital [in Sydney]. I was told it would be a one hour procedure to "have a look around".

'They didn't expect to find anything. Six hours later I woke up with a catheter in, to be told I had severe stage 4 endometriosis with benign tumours that had fused my bladder and bowel together. My endometriosis was so bad that it was from the top of my uterus right down to my bottom and covering many major organs. The doctor actually asked me how I was even able to physically try for a baby without excruciating pain.

'We were absolutely bewildered when told that I should never have undergone IVF or any fertility treatment before the endometriosis was removed because it makes it worse, and even if by some miracle an embryo was able to implant and grow, chances are I would miscarry before term due to the state of my uterine cavity.'

This was just three months ago. 

Needless to say Mrs Watmough felt betrayed and angry to find that the tens and thousands of dollars spent on treatments, the four miscarriages and the six injections she took every day upon other medication  could have all been prevented had the doctors listened to her years ago.

The former model posted a photo of some drugs she had to inject daily which caused huge bruises all over her body

'It's been emotionally draining,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Doctors were telling me I was overreacting and I've been putting my body under a lot of strain, taking unnecessary medication just because it was an easy way out for doctors.

'I've been in pain for six years and the doctors haven't listened to me and we've been put through numerous miscarriages. That makes me angry.'

Mrs Watmough, who married the former Manly Sea Eagles in January last year, says it's impossible to lead a normal life when undergoing IVF.

But the pressure she placed on herself, of being a young and healthy, also added to her stress. 

'You judge yourself if you do something "bad" and wonder if you screwed the whole process up, and are left riddled with guilt,' she wrote in her blog.

'Its beyond devastating. Each month you are SURE it worked. And when it doesn't, you feel like a complete failure.

'How can something that is meant to be so natural become so difficult? Isn't this the sole thing a women is MEANT to be able to do?

'No matter how many people tell you its not your fault..at the end of the day you feel like it is.'

Mrs Watmough says she is grateful for the support of her husband, extended family and friends

Although Mrs Watmough feels 'completely let down and betrayed by professionals', she is also left with regret and wishing that she had sought for more medical advice years ago.

'Considering my condition is stage 4, it is safe to assume if they had investigated it years ago we would have caught it earlier,' she wrote.

'I wish that I hadn't let doctors put me on dangerous steroids. I wish I had trusted my gut before I trusted fertility experts to do the right by me and my husband. And I wish I had someone my age to talk to that had been through this process - because that's the hardest part, finding someone to relate to.

'I wish I hadn't had to put my future health in jeopardy with fertility hormones being linked to future cancers. My goal is to bring to light the importance of pushing to have conditions investigated, because you may not need to go down this path.' 

For now, she's on the mend with the support of her family, including her two step children and 30-year-old husband who also recently announced he has signed with the Parramatta Eels club.

But Mrs Watmough still isn't 100 per cent.

'I don't know what to do next and we haven't found a cure but I made the conscious decision to take a break from it all because I wasn't in the right emotional state and if I had started trying again, I'd think to myself: "what's the point",' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

'The IVF process is intense. The needles are fat and I had bruises all over my stomach so when I ran out of room I had to inject in my bum.

'But I'm not bagging out IVF because I know it's been great for some of my friends. It's just that my case was mismanaged.

'So I just want women to be in charge of their own bodies because it's important to educate yourself on your own health and to get a second opinion.'

Mrs Watmough says she's glad that she made her story public.

'It was hard to write my story and quite emotional for me but I feel like it has been very rewarding,' she said.

'I have also received so many private messages from many women in the same boat. I can finally relate to women who are going through the same ordeal and we can all talk and hear each other's stories. Weirdly it's very empowering.'
