Jessica Judd, the teenage 800 metres star who shot to prominence by breaking the two-minute barrier last year, takes on the might of female British middle-distance running at the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix with a point to prove.

Judd finished fourth at the British Championships last month, beaten by Scotland’s European champion Lynsey Sharp and English duo Jenny Meadows and Alison Leonard, all of whom are competing at Hampden Park. Laura Muir, 21, is also dropping down to the two-lap race after setting a Scottish 1500m record in Paris last week.

It promises to be quite a battle, less than three weeks from the 800m final at the Commonwealth Games in the same stadium, with selection for August’s European Championships also at stake.

Hair we go: Judd took inspiration from Paula Radcliffe and is now gunning for Grand Prix glory

Judd, 19, has already lowered her lifetime best to 1min 59.77sec in Oslo this year, but she’s determined this season will not be a repeat of 2013 when she set personal bests in May and June then failed to progress from the heats at the World Championships.

She said: ‘I don’t want to just run fast times in May or June, I want to back it up when it matters. The 800m is the most competitive it has been for ages. Everyone’s there, and everyone can come out and run a fast time. The competition in Great Britain is brilliant and the fact there are so many of us is only going to make it better.’

Judd has sought guidance from marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe following three ‘unbelievably hard’ months without running after suffering a stress fracture in her back in November. She turned her ankle during a cross-country run in Basildon but carried on training before feeling ‘like a ghost’ and realising her back was the problem.

Judd could not run on Christmas Day for the first time in memory, nor by her 19th birthday in  January, and drove her parents mad ‘bouncing off the walls’, desperate to get back on the track. She was also frustrated that her plan to take a gap year and delay her place at Bath University to read human biology had seen her largely confined to the gym and swimming pool. Judd said: ‘I had broken a bone in my back when I fell but I carried on training because I was more focused on my ankle. I was gutted; really despondent.

‘Paula knew it was really hard for me and she really did get me through it. She gave me some really nice shoes for aqua jogging — trainers for the pool, basically. It’s nice to take inspiration from her because she’s been through it all.’

Judd genuinely loves running. Just like Radcliffe, she would run even if it were not her job, because it is her passion. This is more unusual than you might think for an elite athlete, and Judd has had to rely heavily on her coach, former Commonwealth 5,000m champion Rob Denmark, to keep her from doing too much, too soon.

Passion: Judd genuinely loves running like marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe

The Canvey Island athlete speaks with enthusiasm and stands out on the track because her long, brown hair flows behind her when she competes, but her style is  distinctive, too. She calls it ‘unpleasant’, but the tall, long-limbed Judd is simply a little clunky and choppy. She and Denmark have, however, been working in the gym and biomechanics lab to try to alter how she runs.

Judd said: ‘My running style is very strange. I know it’s not brilliant. I look really unpleasant when I run so I’m trying to make it a bit smoother. There will be certain traits I will never get rid of, but I want to be the best in the world.

‘We’ve taken on different types of training to make me stronger. I just did runs, press-ups and runs again, but now I’ve got an elite programme. I’m always busy and I love it. I just want more and more.’
