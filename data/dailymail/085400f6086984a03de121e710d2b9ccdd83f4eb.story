Shattered glass: Crazed women broke this school bus window behind the driver's seat causing glass to fly into one 15-year-old student's wrist and cut him

Damaged: Women used mace spray to cover the bus in stains before they got back into their green Chevy Tahoe and drove off before police arrived 

'For someone to get out of a vehicle and use a baseball bat and break a window of a yellow school bus knowing that it’s full of students – that’s pretty bizarre,' said Philadelphia Chief Inspector Scott Small.

Apparently there had been some kind of verbal argument between the bus of 21 14-and-15-year-olds and the 4 women who sat inside a green Chevy Tahoe.

'There was some verbal argument between the students on the bus as well as four occupants of the Chevy Tahoe,' said Small.

The angered women drove their green SUV in front of the school bus so as to block its path.

Suddenly two women got out of the vehicle and started attacking the school bus with a baseball bat and mace.

They broke the window behind the bus driver which sent glass flying.

A student was injured after glass pierced a students' wrists but is expected be OK.

The driver of the Tahoe eventually got back into her vehicle and drove off.

The women have not been identified but a witness was able to copy down the license plate of the Chevy Tahoe.

Shortly after the assault, the bus driver drove the injured student to Gilbert Pruance Elementary School where he is not a student but where a nurse was able to bandage his wounds.

The bus has a surveillance camera but it is unknown as to whether or not it captured the attack. 

Searching: The women who attacked this school bus have not been identified but a witness was able to copy down the license plate of their green Chevy Tahoe 

Bizarre: Philadelphia Chief Inspector Scott Small says that attacking a school bus in 'baizarre' behavior and that he will do his best to find the women
