The sick Twitter prankster who pretended to be best friends with shooting victim Antonio Martin and watch him die got his comeuppance today after the infamous 'hactivist' group Anonymous started publishing his personal information on their several Twitter accounts.

Twitter user Jesus Christo (@DesJuanTheThug), who also goes by the name Desjuan Garrett, falsely claimed in an interview with the Huffington Post that he was there when 18-year-old Antonio Martin was killed a Mobil gas station a few miles from Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday.

The group Anonymous, an international network of activists and hackers, weren't pleased with Christos' blatant lies and so they published his phone number along with other personal information to their internationally recognized Twitter account boasting  over 77,000 followers, reports The Daily Dot.

Comeuppance: The hacker and activist group anonymous posted personal information about the Twitter prankster lying to journalists about being friends with the latest police shooting victim

'Confirmed: he has good enough credit for a Visa card, Christmas on @DesJuanTheThug this year. What yall want, last minute online shopping,' they quipped on their page.

'This dude @DesJuanTheThug is a joke. Using #AntonioMartin to gain followers. Here's his # btw,' they tweeted along with a phone number that appears to be his actual cell contact.

Another Twitter user by the name of sin - kah - me (@SynKami) published the information of the SIU Carbondale's Dean of Students should anyone want to report the prankster to school administration.

Desjuan has openly admitted to lying to the Huffington Post and is a self-proclaimed ‘troll.’

‘Now what did we learn? @HuffingtonPost,’ Desjuan posted today but it appears as though most readers aren't amused with his lies.

Other furious Twitter users have rallied against a prankster who pretended he was best friends with latest police shooting victim Antonio Martin.

Jesus Christo claimed in the interview that he was there when the 18-year-old was killed and fabricated an account of how a police officer opened fire on Martin when he refused to lie on the

Desjuan originally tweeted, 'I can't believe my best friend just died in front of me' - and the comment was retweeted more than 3,000 times.

He then posted a series of tweets telling people to listen to his mixtape and add him on SoundCloud - an audio platform that allows people to promote their own music.  

He had earlier told The Huffington Post how he and Martin were stopped by an officer at a Mobil gas station on North Hanley Road because they matched the description of robbery suspects.

He claimed the officer then searched Martin and was quoted as saying: 'The officer then stepped back and pulled his weapon and pointed at Antonio and told us to lay on the ground.

'I laid down but Antonio refused. The officer then stepped back at us with his gun still aimed at us. He told Antonio to lay down again and when Antonio didn't lay down the officer opened fire.

'And when I tried to help my friend he screamed at me to stay down with his weapon still drawn.'

Lie: His vile lie was retweeted more than 2,000 times and he even fabricated an account of last night's shooting in an interview with the Huffington Post

The Huffington Post has since released a statement confirming the account was false which read: 'A previous version of this story included an interview with a man claiming to have been at the scene of the shooting and friends with the deceased. 

'As police have released statements saying the second person involved in the incident has fled the scene, the source is now suggesting he was never there.' 

Christo's fake account of what happened has provoked fury on social media.

Another, Just Letrice, wrote: 'I'm angry! He could've put that officer's life in MAJOR danger based on lies!'

Another wrote: '@DesJuanTheThug claimed he was at the shooting, and did a testimony to Huf Pos.... Ends up he's a liar and did it for RT's...? Wow.'

Furious reaction: Twitter users expressed their anger after learning Christo had invented his harrowing account of watching his 'best friend' die

Christo is clearly unapologetic and has since posted: 'Tell the Huffington Post to do a better job of finding credible sources.'

In another vile tweet, he boasted 'I pi**ed the whole country off' and 'I need two bad bi***es to help me grieve'.

Following Martin's shooting, a large group of protesters gathered at the scene where police are believed to have used pepper spray on the crowd.

Martin's body was kept on the parking lot overnight as the investigation into the shooting began.
