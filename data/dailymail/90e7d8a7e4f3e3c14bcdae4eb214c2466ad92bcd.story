'He had a good, long life,' his son said.

The HBO miniseries, based on a book by Stephen Ambrose, followed the members of Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division from training in Georgia in 1942 through some of the war's fiercest European battles through the war's end in 1945.

Its producers included Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.

Guarnere was portrayed by the actor Frank John Hughes.

Guarnere, whose combat exploits earned him his nickname, lost a leg while trying to help a wounded solider during the Battle of the Bulge.

His commendations included the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts.

In 2007, Guarnere helped write a nationally best-selling memoir called, Brothers in Battle, Best of Friends, with fellow south Philadelphian veteran Edward J. 'Babe' Heffron and journalist Robyn Post.

Heffron died in December at the age of 90.

There are now believed to be three surviving members of the original Band of Brothers.

In 2009 it was recorded there were 20 members of Easy Company alive, however that figure has not been recently updated.

William Guarnere Jr. said his father and Heffron met during the war and remained friends until Heffron died in December.

'Now they're together again,' the son said.

Jake Powers, who operates a Band of Brothers tour company in Grafton, Mass., said Guarnere worked behind the scenes to ensure that his comrades received the recognition they deserved.

'He did more things behind the scenes for other veterans than (for) himself,' Powers said.

Funeral arrangements were incomplete Sunday.

They proceeded to knock out German soldiers and cannons at Brecourt Manor that were firing on allied forces.
