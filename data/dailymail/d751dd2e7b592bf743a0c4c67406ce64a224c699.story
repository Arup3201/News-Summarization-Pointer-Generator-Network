Health scare: Nelson Mandela was being treated for an 'abdominal complaint' today

Nelson Mandela was in a comfortable condition in hospital last night after undergoing surgery for a stomach condition.

The 93-year-old former South African president has a ‘long-standing abdominal complaint’ which needed specialist medical attention.

However, officials insisted his admission was planned rather than an emergency, although they declined  to say where he was being treated.

Last night Mr Mandela was said to be  stable and fully conscious after undergoing  a ‘diagnostic procedure’ and is expected to  be released from hospital today or tomorrow.

A statement from the office of the current president, Jacob Zuma, using Mr Mandela’s honorific name, said: ‘Madiba has had a long-standing abdominal complaint, and doctors feel it needs proper specialist medical attention.

‘The doctors are satisfied with his condition, which they say is consistent with his age.’

Meanwhile, Mr Mandela’s eldest daughter Makaziwe, 57, has spoken of her fears for her father, but said that the family hope he will rally. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘He is very old and I know that one day I have to face being  an orphan. I hope he will pull through, but he is very frail  and weak.’

But Mr Mandela’s eldest granddaughter Ndileka said:  ‘I don’t see it as a big thing. When I saw him on Wednesday he was in good spirits, in perfect health, and the epitome of health, really, for a man of his age.’

The ruling African National Congress said in a statement last night: ‘His condition is not life threatening, the admission was long arranged and therefore is  not an emergency admission. 

‘The ANC would like to wish Madiba a speedy recovery. We believe he is in good hands and there is no need for panic.’

When Mr Mandela was taken  ill last year there was fevered speculation in the South African media and virtual silence from the government, fuelling public fears that he was close to  death. But after two nights he  was discharged.

This time, the authorities appear to have been more open with the public. ‘I can assure you that the former president is in good spirits and well,’ said Mac Maharaj,  a spokesman for Mr Zuma.

A source close to the family said Mr Mandela had been ill for some weeks and had been too unwell  to attend a family celebration  for the birthday of one of his grandchildren ten days ago.

Unusually, visitors had been banned from his home in Johannesburg, where he had been resting before being taken into hospital on Friday night.

A source said: ‘The house has essentially been cordoned off, because he has been so poorly.

‘He hasn’t been feeling well at all and there has been a lot of anxiety about his condition. His pulse has been very quick and  the family feared that his body was beginning to shut down.’

Mr Mandela returned to Johannesburg about three weeks ago from his home in Qunu, the village where he was born. It is believed he made the move to receive the medical treatment.

Makaziwe, a businesswoman also known as Maki, said:  ‘My father always wanted to go back to where he came from.

‘I visit him whenever I can. I spend time with him, precious time.’
