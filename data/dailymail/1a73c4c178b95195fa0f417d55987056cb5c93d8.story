Cristiano Ronaldo's stylist will be used to the Ballon d'Or winners high maintenance preening by now - but it must seem like a weird part of the job when he is sent to perform beauty treatments on his waxwork.

The Museo de Cera in Madrid has held a statue of the Real Madrid superstar since December 2013, and it is one of the most popular of hundreds of celebrity waxworks.

And that might be something to do with the incredible likeness to its real-life twin, which is apparently down to a monthly visit from Ronaldo's stylist.

Staff from the museum have revealed that his wax figure gets a once a month check-up from the beauty professional with the main job to brush his hair - which is imported from India. 

'Cristiano told us to be sure his figure was perfect,' Gonzalo Presa, the museum's communication director told Cadena Ser Catalunya.

'He sent his own hairstylist to brush his figure once a month. Cristiano's (the waxwork's) hair is natural. It is not a wig and it comes from India.'

Real-life Ronaldo is next in action for Real on Saturday as the La Liga leaders visit Athletic Bilbao looking to keep nearest rivals Barcelona at arm's length.

Barca moved to within two points of Real with a 3-1 win at Granada at the weekend while Ronaldo was unable to inspire his side to victory over Villarreal.
