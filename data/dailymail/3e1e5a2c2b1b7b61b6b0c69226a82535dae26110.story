Controversial Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary, recently admitted it was time to put customers first.

And now, the carrier once voted second worst brand in the world, not to mention Britain's least favourite airline, is claiming to be Europe's number one for customer service.

The airline has announced that more than 92 per cent of more than 50,000 Ryanair flights in October arrived on time – a one percent improvement on the same month last year.

Putting customers first: The budget carrier  has called itself 'Europe's number one customer service airline'

Michael O'Leary has said he should have been nicer to customers sooner 

The no-frills airline carried 8.4 million passengers in the month and claimed to have received fewer than one complaint per 1,000 travellers.

A statement on its website added that 'more than 99 per cent of complaints were answered within seven days'. 

Ryanair said the passenger statistics for last month confirm it as Europe's 'number one customer service airline'.

This follows a website relaunch, mobile app, allocated seating and the ability to carry a small second bag on board flights.

Ryanair Head of Communications, Robin Kiely, said: 'Ryanair carried 8.4m customers in October with over 92 per cent of our 50,000 flights arriving on-time as we continued to improve our customer experience.

The airline has made a number of improvements including allowing passengers a second bag on board

'All Ryanair customers may now bring a small second bag on board, make faster bookings and register their details on our easier to use website and brand new app, travel with mobile boarding passes, enjoy "quiet flights" and allocated seating, and use their personal electronic devices at all stages of their flight, as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares in every one of our markets.'

In March this year, Ryanair revealed that it was undergoing a revolutionary image change.

Mr O'Leary said the airline had an 'Always Getting Better' plan, with the aim of 'fixing the things our customers don' like.'

The airline relaxed its  cabin baggage allowance, introduced allocated seating and reduced penalties for failing to print out boarding passes.

Even renowned hard-nosed businessman O'Leary seemed to be showing a softer side. 

Last month, in an exclusive interview with MailOnline Travel, Mr O'Leary admitted that 'We should have been nicer to customers earlier than we have been'.

It comes just a month after Ryanair was named one of the worst brands in the world by customers, second only to insurance company AXA.

Despite recent efforts to transform its reputation, the budget airline was one of the worst-performing brands overall in Siegel+Gale's 2014 simplicity index.

In a survey of more than 12,000 customers in eight countries, Ryanair was named the second worst-ranked brand, based on ease of customer use of a company's products, services, interactions and communications.
