Despite his background as a defender, Blind was deployed in a deep-lying midfield role on Sunday and impressed the Old Trafford faithful as he helped United to a 4-0 win against QPR.

Speaking of his new role, Blind added: ‘I think he can make me a better player in terms of positioning, where to stand and tactics in games because midfield is an important position to play and I hope I can get better at it every day.’
