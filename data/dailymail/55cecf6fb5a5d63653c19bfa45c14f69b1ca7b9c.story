It’s not exactly a life of luxury for newly incarcerated George Zimmerman, but at least he’s not without his Jolly Ranchers and Nutri-Grain bars.

Now accused of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin in February, Zimmerman checked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility in Sanford, Florida, last night.

As he was admitted to the jail last night, he purchased $79.84 worth of items at the prison's commissary.

A report from the Seminole County Corrections department listed the items, which included the essentials: Ivory and Irish Spring soap, deodorant, underwear and socks.

Among the snacks purchased on his first night were Nutrigrain bars, white cheddar popcorn, Jolly Ranchers, chocolate crème cookies and root beer barrels.

To pass the time behind bars, he also purchased playing cards and crossword and word search puzzle books.

Other items included thermal clothes, contact lens solution and several packages of beef sticks.

A separate booking report detailed his tattoos - the tragedy and drama theatre masks on his left arm and a cross on his chest that says 'Christine'.

The John E. Polk Correctional Facility, where Zimmerman is now held, has the capacity for up to 1,396 inmates.

While Zimmerman's cell is equipped for two inmates, he will be alone, and remain separated from the general population.

He will be allowed three hours of recreation time each week, and provided three meals a day: Breakfast at 4am, lunch at 10:30am and dinner at 4pm.

Zimmerman will have access to books and magazines from the jail's library cart, and he’s also allowed to have a Bible.

But just one night in jail has proven to be a strain on the 28-year-old, who claims he was acting in self-defence when he shot Trayvon, who was unarmed.

Law enforcement sources told ABC News that Zimmerman 'wept quite a bit' during the night.

Zimmerman’s attorney Mark O'Mara said 
after the court appearance today: 'He is tired. He has gone through some 
tribulations. He is facing second-degree murder charges now. He is 
frightened. That would frighten any of us'.

'He
has a lot of hatred focused on him right now,' the defense attorney 
said. 'I'm hoping that the hatred settles down now that we're moving 
forward'.

To prove 
second-degree murder, prosecutors must show that Zimmerman committed an 
'imminently dangerous' act that showed a 'depraved' lack of regard for 
human life.

The special prosecutor in the case, Angela Corey, has refused to explain exactly how she arrived at the charge.

But
in the affidavit, prosecutors said Zimmerman spotted Martin while 
patrolling his gated community, got out of his vehicle and followed the 
young man.

Prosecutors interviewed a friend of Martin's who was talking to him over the phone moments before the shooting.

His parents' lawyer has said that Martin was talking to his girlfriend, identified only as Deedee, back in Miami.

'During this time, Martin was on the phone with a friend and described to her what was happening,' the affidavit said.

'The witness advised that Martin was 
scared because he was being followed through the complex by an unknown 
male and didn't know why'.

'No public pressure': State Attorney Angela Corey, appointed to prosecute the Trayvon Martin case, said she charged Zimmerman with murder based only on her judgement of the law in Florida

One request: O'Mara (centre) asked the judge to temporarily seal evidence in the case, including witness statements, so it doesn't come out piecemeal

During a recorded call to a police dispatcher, Zimmerman 'made reference to people he felt had committed and gotten away with break-ins in his neighborhood.

Later while talking about Martin, Zimmerman stated 'these a------s, they always get away' and also said 'these f-----g punks,' according to the affidavit.

If convicted of the second-degree murder charge, he faces a mandatory sentence of 25 years in prison and a maximum of life.
