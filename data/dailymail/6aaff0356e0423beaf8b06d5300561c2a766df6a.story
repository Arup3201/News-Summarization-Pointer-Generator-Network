She has been the face of ABC World News for the past five years – but tonight Diane Sawyer will end her reign as one of America’s best known anchors.

The 68-year-old announced her departure a day earlier than most were expecting and tweeted: ‘See you tonight for my last anchoring - great adventures ahead!'

It is the fourth time that ABC has swapped anchors since the death of ABC veteran Peter Jennings in 2005.

Earlier this year, ABC announced that her replacement will be David Muir, who often sits in the anchor chair when Ms Sawyer is off.

He will officially take over the hot seat on September 2.

According to sources, Ms Sawyer felt that the time was right to make her exit and has done so on her own terms.

She confided in just a handful of close friends about her plan to leave and is leaving with little fuss or fanfare.

It is being suggested that she wants to slow down and take things easier.

But she has already signed up for a new 'adventure.'

She will be heading up an investigative unit for ABC News but will not receive the bumper $20million salary that she reportedly got when she was the face of World News.

Nevertheless she will remain at the heart of the news operation, working alongside reporters and editors who have been carefully chosen for the job.

Many of her new colleagues are said to be already working for Nightline and Good Morning America.

During her long career, Ms Sawyer has had several high profile roles.

In 1984, she became the first female correspondent on 60 Minutes, a CBS News investigative-television news magazine.

During her five years with 60 Minutes, the program regularly ranked among the top-five most-watched in the country

She moved to ABC in 1989 anchored the news magazines Primetime and 20/20 and later co-anchored Good Morning America.

The well-loved anchor has had many career highs including interviews with past and present world leaders including President Obama, Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro.

She has also landed scoops which include the first interview with Jaycee Dugard about her years of captivity and abuse at the hands of Phillip Garrido.

And the reporter and anchor managed to land an exclusive interviews with Amanda Knox.

And in the ongoing ratings battle among news broadcasters ABC World News has been scoring well against NBC's Nightly News.

In fact, according to Nielson, the network's ratings are at a five-year high.

Ms Saywer managed to attract an average audience of about 7.36 million viewers to World News last week.

In the coveted ‘news demo’ spot which is of concern to advertisers, ABC's World News led the pack.

It had 1.918 million viewers of adults 25-54, followed by NBC's Nightly News With Brian Williams with 1.860 million and CBS Evening News With Scott Pelley with 1.635 million.

Ms Sawyer is expected to jump back into the anchor chair for prime-time specials and big interviews.

And ABC is said to be quietly hoping that her exit will draw viewers to watch tonight’s broadcast, as she says her final goodbye.
