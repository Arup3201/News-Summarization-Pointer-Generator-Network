Prince Harry looked dapper in a suit and tie today to watch his cousin Alexander Fellowes marry shoemaker Alexandra Finlay.

Though it was a society affair, with a service at the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of 
Westminster and a wedding breakfast at Claridges, it had an informal feel with guests travelling between venues on a Routemaster bus.

Alexander — known as Beetle to friends — is related to Princes William and Harry through their mother: he is the son of Lord Fellowes, the Queen’s 
former private secretary, who is married to Diana’s middle sister, Jane.

Just family: Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas was nowhere in sight at the London affair

It's second wedding Prince Harry has attended this week as on Saturday he joined Prince William and Pippa Middleton to celebrate the marriage of James Meade to Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk

And his bride has a heritage of her 
own - her father is Old Harrovian stockbroker George Finlay, and she is a
great, great, great-granddaughter of distiller Johnnie Walker

Alexander's other 
cousin, Prince William, was not seen attending the nuptials - perhaps 
because he and the Duchess of Cambridge couldn't get a babysitter for 
their new son Prince George.

Prince
Harry's girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, was also not seen to be attending. 
But the party prince, 29, still had a blonde at his side as he was seen 
chatting and waling to the chapel to his younger cousin Celia 
Mccorquodale, 22.

The wedding guests were all taken to 
the chapel and then on to the wedding breakfast in a decorated 
Routemaster bus that had a heart and the words 'Wedding Special' in 
place of a destination on the front.

Bride Alexandra Finlay wore a traditional silk dress and carried a simple posy of wild flowers

Alexander and Alexandra announced their engagement in February after the groom proposed on a minibreak in Florence.

She told the Daily Mail at the time: 'I am thrilled. He whisked me off to Italy to propose and I've accepted.'

Chelsea-based Alexandra’s shoe firm Fins specialises in colourful loafers for men. She started the business four years ago with investment from the likes of Ben Goldsmith. Clients include Sting and film star Zac Efron.

Her Old Etonian beau cut a dash at Oxford, where he was a member of the Bullingdon Club and was once involved in a  prank in which a pub suffered £500-worth of damage.

These days, however, Alexander is an investment banker for the Spencer Partnership in St James's.

HRH Prince Harry attended the wedding of his cousin Alexander Fellowes who married Alexandra Finlay at the Palace of Westminster on Friday

The old-fashioned routemaster was hired as a 'wedding special' to take guests from the Abbey to the Wedding Breakfast.

The father of the groom is Lord Fellowes which is why the wedding took place at St Mary Undercroft Chapel at the palace

It is
the  second wedding Prince Harry has attended this week as on Saturday he 
joined Prince William and Pippa Middleton to celebrate the marriage of  
James Meade to Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk.

Harry also recently spent 24 hours in a giant freezer to simulate the conditions he will 
face trekking to the South Pole this winter.

Harry,
29, and a group of British servicemen and women with amputated limbs 
will take on teams from the US and Commonwealth in a charity race to the
Pole over 15 days in November and December.

The walking With The Wounded South 
Pole Allied Challenge will see them travel 208 miles across the 
Antarctic in temperatures as low as -50C pulling 11stone sledges. 

Get used to the cold: The youngest Prince rubbed his hands for warmth as he prepared for the South Pole by living in a giant freezer for 24 hours

The group practised putting up tents and using cross trainers inside British engineering design specialists MIRA's whole-vehicle environmental test chambers

The group were subjected to -55C at engineering design specialist MIRA's training base in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

They
practiced putting up tents without getting frostbite and skied on 
cross-trainers for 12 hours, two hours at a time with ten-minute breaks.

Exiting the cold chamber, Harry joked that the worst part had been 'going in.'
