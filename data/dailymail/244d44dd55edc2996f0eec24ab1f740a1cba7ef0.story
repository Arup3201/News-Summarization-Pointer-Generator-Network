Southampton legend Francis Benali has become the first recipient of the Barclays Spirit of the Game Award after his epic 1,000 mile charity run.

The 46-year-old, who played nearly 400 games for his hometown club over a 16-year career, stopped off at all 20 Barclays Premier League grounds along the way during a 21-day period.

Benali raised over £180,000 for Cancer Research UK in the process, after beginning at St James Park and fittingly ending up at St Mary's after completing the arduous challenge.

The Southampton faithful gave Benali a rapturous welcome on his return to the club after completing the run

Reflecting on his trip Benali said: 'I wanted to test myself with a physical and mental challenge that would put me beyond anything I've done before. 

'To grind out mile after mile after mile for 21 days back to back was a really tough challenge. 

'But anybody that's been affected by cancer knows the daily battles the victims face so I thought I can't quit, if I can't complete the run and arrive back at St Mary's it would have been a failure.'

David Wheldon, Managing Director of Brand, Reputation, Citizenship and Marketing at Barclays, added: 'We are delighted to announce that Francis Benali is the first recipient of our Spirit of the Game Award. 

'We wanted to reward those we go the extra mile for their club and community and Francis has certainly done just that. 

'His commitment to Cancer Research UK, Southampton FC and all those fans who supported him along the way deserves to be celebrated so it gives us great pleasure to present Francis with this award.'
