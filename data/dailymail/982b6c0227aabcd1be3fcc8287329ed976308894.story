Sir Roger Moore will today reveal he became the man with the golden bum after a blunder while filming James Bond.

Sir Roger, 86, caught fire during the shooting of the 1977 movie The Spy Who Loved Me – one of seven times he played Bond.

In the scene the villain Stromberg, played by Curd Jurgens, threatens to shoot Bond under the table.

Moore and John Glen, who edited the film, recall the incident in this morning’s edition of BBC Radio 4’s Reunion programme.

Glen said: ‘Stromberg has a gun under the table aimed at Roger’s crotch and at a certain time the special-effects man was to make the explosion. But he mistimed it and it finished up with Roger running around the set with his trousers alight.’

Moore added: ‘I was seriously on fire and it was terrible pain. I had to go to the sister every day and have Vaseline dressings changed on my rear end.’

Britt Ekland also ‘singed her bottom’ making the 1974 film The Man With The Golden Gun.

She said: ‘Roger and I were told exactly the timing between each explosion. We were both told it’s very important that you hit these spots and leave. [But] I was very scared so I did what any normal person would do and threw myself on the ground.’
