Teenager Jasmine Griffiths was bullied to death by cruel taunts on Facebook, her distraught parents have said

A teenager was bullied to death by cruel taunts on Facebook, her distraught parents said today.

Jasmine Griffiths, 18, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was found hanged at her home after receiving ‘dozens’ of messages telling her to kill herself.

Jasmine’s stepmother Kirsty, 35, said the unnamed bullies continued harrassing Jasmine even when she blocked them and also targeted her friends.

She said: 'It was Facebook that did it. It was all over it and that’s what started it.

'They had lots of profiles and they kept adding new ones to get to her when she blocked them.

'They said things like "go die in a hole", "you’re worth nothing", and "go kill yourself".

'She loved her family and her friends.

'It was not the kind of thing you would think people would say to an 18-year-old.

'Did they bully her? Of course they did.

'And when her friends went to stick up for her they went after them too, e-mailing them terrible things.'

Kirsty spoke out alongside Jasmine’s father Neil after a coroner chose not to include the Facebook allegations in the inquest into her death.

Dr Peter Harrowing said he could not be sure the hairdressing student intended to kill herself on the day she died and recorded an open verdict.

The hearing at Flax Bourton near Bristol heard how Jasmine was found dead after a party at her home in April last year.

College friend Rebecca Hemmett said her pal was excited about the party but had been upset by a text message.

Rebecca, who studied hairdressing with Jasmine, told the inquest: 'In the few days before the party she was making really weird comments like "what would you do if I killed myself?"

'I thought it was a bit strange but then it was Jasmine being Jasmine - she came out with silly things all the time.'

Jasmine's stepmother Kirsty, 35, said the unnamed bullies continued harrassing Jasmine even when she blocked them and also targeted her friends

The inquest heard Jasmine had a number of drinks and two or three lines of the stimulant Mephadrone - known as Mcat - at the party.

Friend Zoe Conway thought Jasmine was acting strangely as the party ended around 4am and begged her to come home with her.

Zoe said: 'She was not herself.

Fighting back tears, Zoe added: 'I didn’t want to leave her. I really didn’t want to leave her but she gave me no choice in the end.

'She practically pushed me out of the door.'

Jasmine was found by her brother the following afternoon.

Tests found traces of Mcat in her blood and a postmortem confirmed she had died from hanging.

Dr Harrowing, the assistant deputy coroner for Avon, told the 30 friends and relatives who attended the inquest he could not be sure she intended to kill herself.

After the hearing Jasmine’s dad Neil, 40, a hairdresser,  said: 'Jasmine was a bright and bubbly girl, always full of life and always last to leave the party.
