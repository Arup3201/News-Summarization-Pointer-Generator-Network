A mother is desperately seeking answers two months after her former male model son's body was found with its organs missing in the California desert.

Ray Singleton, a gay 24-year-old aspiring writer and filmmaker who married a celebrity stylist last year, vanished in July after flying from his Atlanta home to Los Angeles for a short vacation.

He rented a car for a trip to Las Vegas but as he drove through the Mojave Desert on July 9, his car broke down near Baker and he was picked up by a Highway Patrol Officer.

He was driven to a rest stop in Baker and once there, he called a friend who lived three hours away and asked for help, his family told Fox News.

Ray Singleton, a 24-year-old former male model and aspiring filmmaker, vanished in July after his rental car broke down in the Mojave Desert. His body was found with missing organs two months later

What happened? Ryan Singleton, 24, a former model who dreamed of becoming a filmmaker, vanished in July and his body was found in the Californian desert in October. His organs were missing

But when the friend arrived, there was no sign of Singleton and a missing person's report was filed.

It was two months before joggers came across Singleton's decomposing body, which was missing its organs, investigators told his mother, Iris Flowers.

She said she now knows little more about his death than she did then - when investigators called her and said: 'Ma'am, there were no eyes, there was no heart, there were no lungs, there was no liver, there were no kidneys.'

The San Bernardino County Coroner’s 
Office said there was no official cause of death after the body was 
found, but that 'the body was severely decomposed. Animals might have 
been involved.'

Although experts for the channel agreed 
that Singleton's organs were most likely scavenged by animals, she said 
she believes there is something more suspicious at work - like organ 
dealers.

Flowers told Fox News: 'I'm waiting for answers. I'm in a holding pattern right now... I don’t know anything other than that my son was found with no organs in his body.'

While she is certain that foul play was involved, she said she does not know of a possible motive.

His
partner, Kithe Brewster, who has styled celebrities from Beyonce to 
Gwen Stefani, also appealed for answers and has voiced his determination
to catch whoever was responsible.

'We still no [sic] nothing from California we still have no answers!' he wrote on Facebook.

Ray Singleton's body was found a few miles from Baker, California after his rental car broke down. He was last seen at a highway rest stop. Two months later, joggers came across his decomposing body

Loss: Singleton broke down as he drove in the desert and when a friend arrived to help him, he was gone

Barren: He called a friend from Baker in California and his body was found a few miles away by joggers

'But if you know anything about Kithe Brewster I can I will find them and the people who took him away will be caught! I can accomplish I will! I've always lived by this and I continue to live by this in all I do!'

He suggested that Singleton could have been targeted as he was openly gay, or he could have fallen victim to an organ theft ring.

He added that he does not believe his husband was killed where he was found, and instead suggested that he was killed and then put back there.

Nancy Scheper-Hughes, a medical anthropologist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told Fox it is 'highly unlikely' that Singleton was killed so his organs could be harvested.
