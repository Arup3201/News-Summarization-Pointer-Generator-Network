Pippa Middleton’s boyfriend Nico Jackson demonstrated a nifty backhand after the couple played tennis yesterday morning.

The 35-year-old stockbroker put a cheeky hand on the world famous posterior as the pair enjoyed an amorous clinch on the streets of London, as passers-by looked on.

Wearing her hair in a ponytail beneath a baseball cap and with a short tennis skirt, 29-year-old Pippa spent a couple of hours in the summer sunshine with her beau before they headed their separate ways.

The couple have been dating for around eight months, and are reportedly set to move in together.

Both sets of parents have been introduced over the last few months, and Nico has been on holiday to Mustique with the Middleton family, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

The pair were first seen together in September last year at the opening of London nightclub, Berkeley Square.

‘Nico is tall, good-looking and has the most amazing piercing blue eyes,’ said a friend.

‘He is incredibly charismatic and stands out from the crowd. He is a really good catch – everyone is after him.’

Tennis is one of their shared passions. Pippa, who attended Malborough College on a sports/all-rounder scholarship, is a keen player and last year won a place in the women’s first team at the exclusive Queen’s Club in West London.

It is apt that she was pictured in tennis garb yesterday, after writing about Wimbledon in her first column for Vanity Fair magazine earlier in the week.

She even made reference to her own claim to fame by mentioning the famous Athena poster of the Seventies showing a female tennis player, calling it a ‘tennis classic with another famous bum!’

‘All the boys at school had this on their bedroom walls,’ she wrote, admitting: ‘I’ve been sent similar cheeky ones by friends over the years.’ 

One of them was a 15th birthday card from her grandparents showing a cartoon rear-view of a tennis player in a very short skirt. 

‘If only they’d known what was to come!’  Pippa wrote.

She further recalled her love of the game, writing: ‘I first went to Wimbledon when I was eight years old and already a very keen tennis player.’

She even bought herself a postcard of the women’s singles trophy and signed it with the message: ‘I will win this one day’.

She also told her family that if she ‘had to get married’ it would be in tennis whites, but with ‘shorts, with no pleats or frills’.

Tennis is not the only sport Pippa 
and Nico share a passion for, and in March they both competed in a 
26-mile ski marathon in St Moritz, Switzerland.

Pippa
was cheered over the finish line by her parents, Carole and Michael, 
before she was embraced by Nico, who completed the course eight minutes 
ahead of her.

Unlike many of Pippa’s past boyfriends, Nico doesn’t come from a particularly wealthy or privileged background.

His parents, Martyn and Ulrike, run a ski and sportswear shop in Folkestone, Kent, where they live in a modest £250,000 home.

Nico was educated at The Harvey Grammar School in Folkestone and Kingston University in Surrey.

After graduating he made his fortune as a stockbroker and in 2010, he sold the leasehold on a luxury two-bedroom flat in a grand Georgian building in Kensington for £1.56 million.

The property is just around the corner from David and Victoria Beckham’s new rented home and actor Dustin Hoffman’s townhouse.

It is understood that his job at Deutsche Bank meant he was introduced to elite social circles where his good looks and charming manner allowed him to fit in effortlessly.

A neighbour of the family in Folkestone said: ‘I’ve known Nico since he was a boy.

‘Nico is always very well-mannered, the whole family is. I know Nico is terrific at skiing, maybe that’s where he met Pippa, on the ski slopes.’
