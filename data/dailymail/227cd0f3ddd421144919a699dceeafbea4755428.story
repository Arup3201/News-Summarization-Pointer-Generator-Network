The sound of her mother's voice has made a previously deaf three-year-old New York City girl dance with delight.

Kennedy Steele, who had never heard her mother before because she was born without auditory nerves, busted out her joyous dance moves after surgery at NYU's Langone Medical Center. 

She had an experimental procedure at the hospital that installed an auditory brainstem implant.

The implant now bypasses what's missing in her inner ear, according to CBS News. 

The FDA approved testing of the implant on children at Langone in New York and three other hospitals in Massachusetts, California and North Carolina.

Some older patients can already receive the implant. 

Mom Nickia Steele said: 'It's something I've been looking forward to for a long time.

'My family is looking forward to getting to communicate better with her. 

'That's been the most important thing.'

Doctors will follow Kennedy's progress for the next five years to see how her speech capabilities progress

The auditory brainstem implant, which is being tested in children, now bypasses what's missing in her inner ear

Doctors will follow Kennedy's progress for five years to see how her speech capabilities progress. 

It's unclear if the experience of hearing sounds will allow Kennedy's brain to understand language and get her talking, WCAX reported. 

Dr J Thomas Roland of Langone called the results 'quite encouraging'.

He said: 'We think that these kids are getting auditory information and are on a trajectory to develop oral language acquisition and oral speech.'
