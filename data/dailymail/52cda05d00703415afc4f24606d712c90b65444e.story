Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls claimed last week that Britain's families are in the grip of a crisis

Standards of living in Britain have climbed to among the best in Europe – despite claims by Labour that the UK still faces a ‘cost of living crisis’.

Families now enjoy the sixth highest quality of life in the EU due to a steadily recovering economy since David Cameron came to power, official figures showed yesterday.

The UK is now tied with Denmark and France in the living standards league table – ahead of Belgium and the Netherlands.

The figures, recorded by the Office for National Statistics, fly in the face of claims by Labour that Britain’s families are in the grip of a crisis.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last week said that ‘for most people there is no recovery at all’ and accused the government of having ‘no real action’ to raise living standards.

Amid jeering, he said Britain was experiencing ‘the slowest recovery for over 100 years’. Ed Miliband this week accused the Prime Minister of being ‘utterly complacent’ and ‘in denial’ about the rising cost of living – only to be told by Mr Cameron that Britain now has one of the fastest rates of growth among Western economies.

And despite fears by critics that the economic recovery is not trickling down to ordinary families, George Osborne said ‘Britain’s economic plan is working’ amid the doubling of economic growth forecasts. The figures, compiled by statistics agency Eurostat, show that living standards have improved since 2011.

Luxembourg, a tiny nation of only half a million people, tops the list and is followed by  Germany, which has seen its economy and exports boosted by the single currency. In 2011, when its economy was still in the doldrums, Britain was tied with Belgium in seventh place, and lagging behind France. 

But the French, under socialist president Francois  Hollande, have seen their standard of living flatline – while Britain has climbed. 

The quality of life table compiled by the Office for National Statistics reveals the UK economy is steadily improving

Life in the UK is now 14 per cent better than the average across the 28 EU member states, according to the figures. The worst countries are Bulgaria – where living standards are 51 per cent worse than the average – and Romania, where they are 50 per cent lower.

Norway and Sweden, which are not members of the EU, also enjoyed living standards that were well above the EU average. The ONS said: ‘In 2012 the standard of living in the UK was joint sixth highest in the EU with France and Denmark, up one place from last year.’ 

Its measurements include goods and services consumed by individuals, as well as other benefits from living in the UK such as free healthcare and education.

The figures relate to 2012, but are likely to have increased  further this year as the economic recovery takes hold. Last week the Government’s independent forecaster said the economy will grow at 1.4 per cent this year – almost twice as fast as previously expected. 

The Office of Budget Responsibility also upgraded the outlook for next year from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent. Both unemployment and inflation have also dropped.

Mr Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices if Labour wins power at the next election, in a move described as ‘economic vandalism’ and widely derided by industry experts.

But in last week’s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor said Labour had been proved ‘comprehensively wrong’ in demanding an end to austerity and said the annual deficit would be eliminated by 2018.

n The pay gap between men and women has widened for the first time in five years, figures reveal.

The difference in wages is now 10 per cent – up from 9.5 per cent in a year. Full-time male workers now get an average of £13.60 per hour, while a woman is paid only £12.24, said the Office for National Statistics.
