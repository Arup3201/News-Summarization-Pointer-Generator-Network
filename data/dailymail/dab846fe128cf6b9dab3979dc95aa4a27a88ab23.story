A controversial Spanish dolphin trainer who was coming to the US to work at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta has gone missing.

Jose Luis Barbero, 59, can allegedly be seen hitting and kicking dolphins in videos that caught the attention of animal protection groups, but he was still hired as a vice president at the aquarium.

The aquarium's newest hire, who was working on the resort island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain, has vanished.

Dolphin trainer Jose Luis Barbero, who was just hired by the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has gone missing

 Before he vanished, videos of Barbero, 59, (rear) allegedly hitting and kicking dolphins surfaced on the internet

After the videos (pictured above) started popping up on the web, Barbero began receiving death threats 

Barbero went missing before another video  accusing him of abusing dolphins was released yesterday, according to 11 Alive. 

He was last seen on Tuesday leaving his home, WSB TV reported. 

Balearic Islands emergency services are continuing to search for him. 

Georgia Aquarium CEO Mike Leven said, 'We are very concerned. 

'We hope he turns up soon and that everything is all right. Our thoughts are with him and his family.'

According to Leven, Barbero received death threats after the videos surfaced. 

The embattled trainer did respond to the videos on Facebook. 

In a translated post he said: 'I believe a response is needed to this brutal and cowardly campaign against my profession.

'I can only say from my lawyers' recommendations that this video is a montage created to provoke a campaign challenging my professionalism over 35 years.' 

 A former FBI agent was also hired by the Georgia Aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation

The most recent video allegedly shows Barbero being aggressive towards dolphins during a training session at a theme park in Spain. 

Animal advocacy group SOSdelfines said the videos are 'meant to show how captive dolphins are treated', according to the Dodo. 

The aquarium has questioned whether the videos of Barbero are authentic and used the terms 'extremely questionable' and 'crudely edited' to describe them. 

Aquarium leaders claimed to have 'thoroughly reviewed and vetted' Barbero as a candidate and also cited that he has 35 years of professional experience.

Experts were brought in to analyze the content of the videos.

A former FBI agent was also hired by the aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation.

It is unclear what Barbero's job status is at the  moment, but he it appears he is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium.

The Georgia Aquarium maintains that it has a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals

The aquarium released a statement about the Barbero investigation on Friday afternoon.

It said: 'Our search for truth into the allegations against Jose Luis Barbero continues. 

'Until our investigation is complete, we will not make any decisions regarding his employment, so at this time, Mr. Barbero remains in Spain.

'We are committed to making decisions based on factual information and very thorough analysis. 

'We have a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals and continue to investigate every aspect of this matter. 

'We appreciate your patience and support as we sort through this difficult situation.'

It seems that Barbero is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium at this time
