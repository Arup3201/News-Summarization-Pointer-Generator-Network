Luiz Felipe Scolari has emerged from his World Cup nightmare to take charge of his first training session on his return to Brazilian side Gremio.

The former Brazil national side and Chelsea manager put his new charges through their paces during a training session in Porto Alegre.

Scolari left his post as Brazil boss after a disastrous end to their World Cup last month.

All eyes: Scolari will be keen to enjoy similar success to what he achieved in his last two spells at Gremio

Respected: Scolari has a vast amount of managerial experience domestically and internationally

Brazil were humiliated 7-1 against Germany in the semi-final before being humbled 3-0 by Holland in the third place play-off, the two results sparking national outrage.

After suffering their heaviest loss in semi-final history against the Germans, Scolari's misery was compounded when the five-time World Cup winners lost again the Dutch in their last fixture - the first time since 1940 they had lost consecutive games on home soil.

The 65-year-old has returned to Gremio for a third time, after previous stints at the helm in 1987 and between 1993-96.

In his second spell in particular he enjoyed great success, winning six trophies in just three years as he began to establish himself as a highly reputable coach in Brazil.

If his record in Brazil prior to this is anything to go by he'll prove to be a big success again - that's for sure.
