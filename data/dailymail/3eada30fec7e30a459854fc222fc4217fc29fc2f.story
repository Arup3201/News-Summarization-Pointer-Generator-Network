Designer Alberto Moretti has proved he has the Midas touch by creating 24 carat gold shoes.

The Italian designer, who can count Jessica Chastain, Cameron Diaz and Elle Macpherson among his celeb fans, unveiled the golden heels for women and loafers for men at the Monaco Grand Prix at the end of May.

As you would expect of a designer shoe covered in precious metal, a pair does not come cheap with prices starting at 2000 Euros (£1,700).

The shoes, made from velvet and covered in gold, will only be on sale at five of the word's most exclusive department stores - Barneys in New York, Fred Segal in L.A., The Swank in Hong Kong, Level Shoe District in Dubai and Harrods in London.

Gold has featured heavily in Alberto Moretti's autumn/winter 13 shoe collection but the brand say their latest offerings are the world's first 24 carat shoe that can actually be worn.

Made in collaboration with HORO, the brand said the style has been kept simple as the gold speaks for itself as a luxury and stylish product.

'Both models (the stiletto and loafers) are simple with essential 
lines, the importance of the material that covers the entire surface of 
the shoe makes it unnecessary to any kind of decoration,' they state. 

Alberto Moretti, from Tuscany, established the label bearing his own name with his brothers in 2011 and within a few seasons has established a star - and royal - following.

As well as the Hollywood actresses previously mentioned, Lady Gaga has also worn his shoes. The pop star - famed for her eccentric style- wore a pair of bespoke stilettos to her perfume launch in Paris last year. They featured a high heel with gold detail.

He has also been given a royal seal of approval by Princess Tatiana of Greece and Denmark while our own Prince Harry is said to have worn shoes from the label's men's range.

Other male celebrity fans - who could perhaps soon be seen in the gold loafers next - are actors Ryan Gosling and Andrew Garfield.
