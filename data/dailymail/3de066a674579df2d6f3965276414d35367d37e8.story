A man who is accused of running over and killing his neighbour with his car apparently wrote a detailed 'action plan' of revenge on his computer.

Melbourne retired civil engineer Joseph Drago, 69, is charged with murdering Anthony Richard Dockerty over a dispute regarding Mr Dockerty's rowdy dog.

Police found an `action plan' on Drago's computer setting out attacks ranging from flooding Mr Dockerty's house to putting an inflatable kangaroo on the road at night in the hope he would crash, the court has heard.

'He has contemplated crime after crime after crime before the man died,' Mr Tinney told the court on Friday.

Victorian Supreme Court prosecutor, Andrew Tinney SC, said Balwyn North local Drago had complained to police after Mr Dockerty failed to appear at court last year when both were charged with offences relating to their dispute.

Mr Tinney said Drago told police in November: 'If you're not going to do your job I will and you're not going to like what I do.'

CCTV footage played to a previous court hearing showed Drago accelerating over Mr Dockerty, dragging him under his car some 116 metres down the road

On December 2 Drago drove to the Thornbury factory where Mr Dockerty worked to take photos of him.

The pair had an altercation before Drago climbed into his car, while Mr Dockerty stood in front of the vehicle to block his escape.

CCTV footage played to a previous court hearing showed Drago accelerating over Mr Dockerty, dragging him under his car some 116 metres down the road.

Drago's barrister Constantine Helliotis QC said the anti-social acts that took place between Drago and Mr Dockerty were not on the plan of action.

'There is no connection between what's on the computer and what happened in real life,' Mr Helliotis said.

Drago reportedly told police in November: 'If you're not going to do your job I will and you're not going to like what I do.'

Psychologist Patrick Newton said the plan was contemplated action rather than implemented action and Drago had lost perspective.

'People in heated disputes, protracted disputes, often consider things that are out of proportion,' Mr Newton said.

Judge Paul Coghlan said the extraordinary material found on the computer had not been properly addressed by Mr Newton's reports.

He adjourned the bail application to allow further psychological testing on Drago.
