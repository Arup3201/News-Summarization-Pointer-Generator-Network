Millions took to the streets to celebrate a night to remember as the country ushered in 2015 - and some clearly enjoyed the occasion more than others.

In Devon, a 27-year-old builder was hacked to death with an axe after a mass brawl broke out in the village of Tamerton Foliot. The victim, named locally as Tanis Bhandari, was attacked amid scenes of ‘major disorder’ as a pub was closing at around 1.30am.
