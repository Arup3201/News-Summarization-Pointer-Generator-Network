Manchester United's first-team squad were in full flow at training on Friday, as they prepare for a season-defining clash at Liverpool.

The rivalry between the two clubs goes back a long way, but in terms of money, this Sunday's game is more important than most of the previous ties.

Louis van Gaal put his charges through their paces ahead of a game that could define their finishing position this season.

There is no championship on the line, but instead fourth place and Champions League qualification rests heavily on this weekend's match. 

United currently sit fourth, two points ahead of Liverpool, and will hope to extend the gap to five points with a win at Anfield. 

Michael Carrick has recently returned from injury to regain his place in the starting line-up, and the oldest player in the United squad knows he must provide assistance to his team-mates.

'There is a responsibility that comes with the experience you have,' he told United Review. 'There is a lot of experience within the squad and there is also a group of younger lads and you try to help them and give them advice at certain times.

'I'm not one to sit everyone down and discuss things; it’s more about giving advice and little pointers at different times.'

'It's good to be back and I feel fine,' he added, when asked about his fitness. 'Once you get back, you just want a run of games and hopefully I can get that.'

Carrick missed the start of the season, before a run of games from December to January was halted by another injury.

He returned for United's game against Newcastle in March, and has impressed since.

'It's been a bit of a nightmare season for me injury-wise,' Carrick continued, 'and just at the time in my career where you’re getting a little bit older and you want to be playing as much as you can and enjoy your football. 

'I’ve had a good run over the years, though, and hopefully this is the only blip so I can bounce back and get a good run of fitness now.'
