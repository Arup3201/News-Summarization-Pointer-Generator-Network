Air France plans to cancel a number of flights as a result of possible national strike action throughout May. 

The month-long strike is because France's biggest pilots' union is unhappy about the rules surrounding their right to strike. 

Air France has said it believes the delays and cancellations could threaten its recovery.

The strike is being organised by the union SNLP France Alpa and will last between May 3 and May 30.

A spokesman for the airline said in a statement: 'This strike action is unusual both for its significance, lasting nearly a month, as well as for its methods which will penalize Air France flights at two peak times of day.'

France's largest pilots union is calling for strikes for two hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon and most of the affected flights will be cancelled, Air France said in a statement. 

Unions want a law repealed that forces pilots to inform their companies that they intend to go on strike for 48 hours before the walk-out.

This is because airlines need to get information to affected passengers in advance.

Connections at the Charles de Gaulle Paris airport, north of Paris, would also be affected

However, unions believe this law undermines the impact of their industrial action because it allows airlines to draft in pilots from other countries.

A recent EasyJet strike did not result in any flight delays or cancellations despite the fact that 85 percent of pilots walked-out, according to the union.

Air France CEO Frédéric Gagey has sent an open letter to the president of the union calling for him stop the strike. 

'To avoid this situation and out of respect for its customers, Air France will be forced to cancel the majority of flights operated by striking pilots.

'Only a very limited number of flights will be rescheduled,' it said.
