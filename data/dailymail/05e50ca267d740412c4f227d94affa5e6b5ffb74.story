Pippa Middleton turned travel expert to write her latest column for glossy magazine Vanity Fair, listing 'what she deems to be' the very best of the world's top ski resorts. 

Inviting her readers to 'boot up, clip in, and make fresh tracks', the 31-year-old contributing editor proceeds to recommend a series of luxury locations in the mountains, from Deer Valley in Utah to Verbier in Switzerland, a favorite with the British Royal Family - who are, of course, Ms Middleton's in-laws.

'Come wearing either a party hat or powder skis; there's never a dull moment at this resort,' she writes about the Swiss resort.

'Verbier is for serious skiers  who love off-piste and moguls,' she adds. 'On-piste skiing here isn't too challenging.'

Indeed, only last week Prince Andrew, his daughter Prince Eugenie and Prince Harry's former girlfriend Cressida Bonas were pictured enjoying a weekend getaway at the Swiss resort, staying in a luxury £22,000-per-week chalet.

Ms Middleton, who began writing for Vanity Fair in June 2013, is widely known to be a skilled and enthusiastic skier.

She has even competed in a number of cross country races at some of the very resorts featured in her recent column. 

In March 2013, the socialite and her banker boyfriend Nico Jackson took part in the 26-mile Engadin Ski Marathon in Saint-Moritz, Switzerland, alongside Ms Middleton's younger brother James.

The following year the couple slowed things down a bit in order to enjoy a more relaxed getaway in Lech Am Alberg, Austria. Both resorts are included in her Vanity Fair piece.

In total Ms Middleton recommends eleven resorts in the US, Canada and Europe, highlighting their various positive attributes of each one and in some cases suggesting which ability levels would be best suited to different resorts.

But while the author, who published her own party-planning book Celebrate in 2012, details her own personal trips to several of the resorts - praising the traffic-free roads in Zermatt, Switzerland and the pristine powder in Lech Am Alberg, Austria - she doesn't actually make clear whether or not she has visited all of the locations included in the column. 

Unsurprisingly however, given her fondness for the speedy snow sport, she still writes with authority when it comes to describing the pros and cons of each resort - even sharing her own unique observations about her preferred places. 

'Jackson Hole] has a decidedly Rockies feel, with lots of people wearing cowboy boots,' she says of the Wyoming-based resort, before recommending that visitors try out the National Elk Refuge sleigh rides.

She adds that visitors to the Swiss resort of Saint-Moritz should try and ski across the area's beautiful frozen lakes, saying: '[The frozen lakes] go on for miles, and a big highlight of the year is the Engadin marathon, which happens in March.

'The Cresta toboggan run, which I attempted five years ago on ladies' day, is not for the fainthearted but is fun to watch.' 

She also praises the 'ambiance' of Deer Valley in Utah, the 'long runs' of Colorado's Aspen resort and the 'good shops and restaurants' that can be found in Whistler, Canada.

Interestingly, although she is one of Vanity Fair's star contributing authors, alongside the likes of Monica Lewinsky and Diane Von Furstenberg, Ms Middleton's column failed to be featured on the cover of this month's issue.

Instead, the Royal in-law has been relegated to the 76th page of the publication - perhaps an indication that her column, once revered as one of the highlights of the magazine, has fallen out of the highest favor with her editors.

But that may not bother Ms Middleton particularly as it has been widely reported that she has been signed up as a correspondent for NBC's Today show. 

In November last year, the Brit paid a visit to New York, reportedly to meet with executives from the show and discuss her provisional contract, believed to be worth an estimated $500,000. 

Following her meeting, Ms Middleton jetted off to Jackson Hole, Wyoming - another location which is featured in her latest Vanity Fair column - where she was spotted at a hoedown dance with locals surrounded by cameras. It is believed that she was filming a test piece for the Today show.
