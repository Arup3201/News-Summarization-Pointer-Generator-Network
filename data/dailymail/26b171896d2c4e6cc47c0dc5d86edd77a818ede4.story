It's been served up as both masterful for taking attention off the breakdown of her 10-year marriage, and moronic for its new-age pretentiousness.Â 

But the psychotherapist who created the concept of 'conscious uncoupling' - two words being hailed the 'term of 2014' after Gwyneth Paltrow used it to announce her 'friendly divorce' to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin - said she has never met or worked with the actress.

However Katherine Woodward Thomas, who is also a yoga teacher, said the Iron Man star may have been one of her many anonymous online students, with a five-week Conscious Uncoupling course having been available for two years at a cost of $297.

Paltrow was undeniably aware of the true meaning of the term last week when she announced her divorce on her website, Goop, in an attempt to establish their separation as amicable, Thomas said.

Causing a stir: The way in which Gwyneth Paltrow chose to announce her separation from husband of 10 years, Chris Martin, created all kinds of controversy, with critics calling her pretentious and trying to make it seem her divorce was more special than others

Officially uncoupled: Paltrow met Martin backstage at a Coldplay concert in October 2002 and the pair were married in December 2003. They have now separated but will continue to 'co-parent' their two children

'No (I haven't met Gwyneth) but I teach online courses and I never really know who is taking the courses or not,' she told TODAY on Monday.

'The company that produces my courses is very careful to protect the anonymitiy of the clients that come in.

'I think most of us are pretty familiar with an antagonistic, angry process with ending a relationship, but it doesn't have to be this way.

'So a concious uncoupling is a breakup that is characterized by goodwill, by generosity and by respect.

'It leaves both parties feeling both parties feeling valued and appreciated for all that is shared.

'Its about two people striving to reduce the damage to themselves and theiry children, if there are children involved.'

Thomas went on to thank the couple for using their own journey to help and inform others.

'They took their time of personal heartache and they used it to really introduce an end to relationships that is healthy and less contensious,' she said.

Psychotherapist Katherine Woodward wrote a seven-week guide to finding one's true love but, after her marriage broke down, was compelled to write about handling divorce with ease, which she called Conscious Uncoupling

Thomas told The New York Times that she first found out Paltrow had used her term when she opened her laptop last week to a flood of emails about the two-year-old phrase.

However she was also quick to establish that 'Concious Uncoupling' - which she has transformed into a business - was first coined by a friend.

Thomas had written a book about a seven-week formula that could attract 'the love of your life', based on her own relationship with her then-husband.

However when the marriage ended in divorce, she felt compelled to write a follow-up.

She was discussing divorce one day with a filmmaker friend, who came up with the 'concious uncoupling' term on the spot.

Thomas calls this her 'eureka moment', and immediately rushed to purchase the URL, eventually creating a workshop on the phrase.

Still together: Despite announcing their separation, Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow spent the weekend vacationing in the Bahamas with their two children. On Friday night they were seen out with friends at a restaurant

Paltrow and Martin, meanwhile, seem to be keeping good on their uncoupling promise.

The estranged couple are currently on vacation together, along with their children Apple, 9, and Moses, 7, on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera.

The two enjoyed a parents-night-out on Friday at a beachfront restaurant with friendss and were seen sharing laughs.
