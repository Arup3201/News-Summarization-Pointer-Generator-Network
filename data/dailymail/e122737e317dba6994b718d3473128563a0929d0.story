As homes become ever smaller in busy cities, a new innovation could mean that bathrooms are able to be more compact.

A space saving toilet with a foldable bowl has been designed by British students to make the humble loo more efficient.

The Iota concept has a clever flush system that works when the toilet is moved into an upright position and saves water.

A space saving toilet with a foldable bowl has been designed by British students to make the humble loo more efficient. It works because the folding toilet bowl contains a built-in U bend that disengages from the waste pipe when in the seated position

Iota works because the folding toilet bowl contains a built-in U bend that disengages from the waste pipe when in the seated position.

When the flush mechanism is activated by folding the toilet into its upright position, the U bend re-engages simultaneously.

An air-tight seal ensures that waste stays where it should be.

An internal frame supports the bowl using a sliding hinge mechanism and a nylon roller.

The hinge mechanism keeps the toilet straight, while the roller takes the weight of the user and transfers it through the frame to the floor.

Designed by Gareth Humphreys and Elliott Whiteley who are students at the University of Huddersfield, Iota takes up a third of the space of a standard toilet when it is folded in the upright position and not being used.

The foldable loo is more efficient than standard toilets too as it uses just two-and-a-half litres of water per flush, compared to six litres for an average toilet.

While the toilet is currently just a concept, Mr Humphreys and Mr Whiteley have submitted a patent application for their design and are looking to sell the idea.

The duo reckon their innovation could save 10,000 litres per person, per year, in typical use.

Their Iota design has been entered into The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) Student Design Awards - Re-Invent the Toilet competition.

The competition challenges students to change the toilet and make it more environmentally friendly.

‘Ordinary toilets have many problems - one is an excessive use of water which is created by large volumes of water used to force waste around the water trap to leave clean water in the trap,’ Mr Humphreys and Mr Whiteley explained.

‘The current conventional toilet is also very big, thus impacting greatly on small bathrooms.

‘In order to solve these problems, a mechanism has been created to allow the bowl to be folded away.

‘Iota is an ingenious solution using considerably less water than a standard toilet, it has a remarkably small footprint when folded in the upright position and thanks to its rimless design it is much easier to keep the bowl clean,’ they added.

They believe their design fits well with the current trend of new build houses getting smaller as ‘saving space is a big concern.’
