A taekwondo black belt used her martial arts training to fight off a deadly tiger shark while taking a leisurely swim off the coast of Maui.

Mariko Haugen had been swimming with turtles and was just 25 feet from shore with her husband, Don, when she came face-to-face with the 12-foot shark.

Her reflex reaction was to throw some punches at the predator, and she managed to catch it flush on the nose – forcing it to turn and swim in the opposite direction.

‘All of a sudden, it was like Hollywood. You see the big jaws coming at you,’ Mariko said. ‘I can't say how terrifying that is.’

But Mariko, who was holidaying on the Hawaiian island, did not escape the scuffle unscathed.

She needed 60 to 70 stitches in her hand after a punch slipped off the side of the tiger shark’s snout and into its jaws.

Mariko was not bitten by the shark, but its razor-sharp teeth left a sizeable gash on her hand.

A California surfer who survived a shark attack says he punched the beast in the head until it finally released him. 

Scott Stephens says the great white pulled him underwater on Tuesday at a popular surf spot and let him go only after receiving the blows to its head.

Doctors say Stephens suffered at least seven deep lacerations, but none of his vital organs were damaged and was recovering well on Wednesday. 

The 25-year-old thanked the doctors who operated on him and strangers who came to his aid.

Scott says the attack will not discourage him from getting back in the water and surfing again.

‘I punched it twice with this hand,’ she told ABC as she held up her bandaged wrist.

She added: ‘I punched it this way, and that one contacted. But this (punch) kind of hit the side and slid into the mouth.

‘I credit my training in martial arts, my taekwondo, to prepare me to learn how to punch.’

After the shark had retreated, the couple, from Folsom, California, were able to swim safely to shore.

Although Mariko thanks her quick reflexes and taekwondo training, Don believes the couple were fortunate to escape alive.

He said: ‘I think we were really lucky.’

Tiger sharks, named because of the dark stripes found on the side of their bodies, have been known to attack humans before.

These sharks have gained a reputation
for eating anything, and will target smaller fish, turtles and even 
types of dolphin as food.

But Don is refusing to let the terrifying experience he and Mariko endured keep them out of the sea for long.

He
said: ‘I've always told my kids there's zero reasons to fear sharks 
because what is scary is breast cancer. Breast cancer is scary. That is 
one in eight.

‘Getting bitten by a shark is one in 4 million to visitors to Hawaii, so we should not have to worry at all.’
