While many streets across the country are decorated with festive greetings, the roads of Birmingham look distinctly less cheerful.

Rubbish has piled up around the city after collections were suspended for Christmas and Boxing Day leaving residents angry.

But homeowners are asking why the city's council did not organise an extra collection, or rearrange the delivery date so it would not clash with Christmas or Boxing Day.

Piles of rubbish litter the Moseley area of Birmingham, and residents fear the winds will blow the rubbish all over their community

Household waste in the area has built up over the festive period, and homeowners have demanded to know why a collection could not have been made

Those living in Bordersley Green in Birmingham say the winds threaten to scatter the rubbish everywhere.

Furious resident Lisa Wenner, 69, who has lived in the area all her life, said: 'The rubbish is 10ft high in some places, the winds are getting pretty high and if the bags aren't collected soon the rubbish will be blown everywhere.

'If that happens we are going to have rubbish in our houses and gardens, what would be done about that?

'Surely an extra collection could have been arranged for the day after Boxing Day?'

Local Ian Richards, 35, an account manager, added: 'I don't pay my council tax for my rubbish not to be collected just because it's Christmas.

'Surely if a service is going to be removed then we should get some money back?

'Did they not think that Christmas means far more rubbish? Far more for us to deal with?

Rubbish dump: The council says they widely publicised the fact that collections would not be made over Christmas

Residents have been 'shocked' that the council did not provide a Christmas rubbish collection

'I bet they blame government cuts or something, but they could have just rearranged it for the next day.

'As for seeing adverts about it 
across the city, well I certainly didn't see any, it came as a complete 
shock to me and my family.'

Mother-of-two Emily Clapham, 29, is frightened that the build up of waste will spread germs: 'The whole area is going to stink soon, it's raining here and the bags are becoming saturated with the water.

'Soon this is going to start breeding diseases, we should not have to deal with that, especially not at this time of year.'

Resident James Furnish, 45, said: 'We all have a bit more rubbish at Christmas, and when they don't come and pick it up what can we do?

'It's piled high down every street, you have to walked down the pavements everywhere, and sometimes it's started to blow into the road.

'They haven't even cleared the litter bins they provide on the streets, so those are overflowing as well.

'Pretty soon this whole area is going to start to smell awful. It's disgusting.'

Eric Pickles has warned councils they face a cut in Government funding if they do not reinstate weekly collections

A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said the collection dates had been 'widely publicised'.

He said: 'The bins are collected weekly, they were suspended over Christmas Day and Boxing Day and that was widely publicised.

'Collections resumed on the 27th and will be continuing over New Year, if they would normally have a collection on Boxing Day they will have on on January 2.'

Birmingham City Council could face the wrath of Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who warned councils last month that they face a cut in Government funding if they refuse to reinstate weekly bin collections.

Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles says a voluntary scheme has ‘stopped the rot’ and prevented more councils switching to hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes.But he threatened to go further - suggesting central Government grants to local authorities will be slashed in the long-term for those that refuse to bring back the weekly bin round.At least half the homes in Britain - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks.

The politician said in his vow to bring back weekly collections: 'I believe it’s a fundamental right for 
every Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their 
chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for 
it to be collected.'Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives.

They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory, when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks.

The Audit Commission downgraded councils in their inspections if they kept weekly collections and told them to adopt 'progressive' solutions of 'only emptying the refuse bin on a fortnightly basis or issuing smaller bins'.

The Coalition announced a £250million scheme to prevent more local authorities moving to fortnightly collections and persuade others to switch back.

Mr Pickles has approved bids from 85 councils.

But despite his strong words, just five local authorities have restored weekly collections in full.
