A dramatic new video captures the moment Canadian gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau arrived at Parliament yesterday.

The Muslim convert is seen jumping out of his car while holding a gun as terrified bystanders frantically free from the man, who had just killed Corporal Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial and would be shot dead himself just minutes later.

The video was released by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in a news conference where it was also revealed that the troubled 32-year-old may have been a dual citizen with Libya and that police have found no connection between yesterday's incident and one on Monday where a Muslim convert also killed a solider.

That man, who was described by authorities as 'radicalized,' hit and killed a solider with his car before being shot dead. 

Commissioner Bob Paulson described Zehaf-Bibeau as a Canadian-born petty criminal before showing the video and acknowledging his possible dual Libyan citizenship. 

Zehaf-Bibeau's father, Bulgasem Zehaf, was a Libyan citizen. 

It was also revealed that the young man was not on the watch list of 90 Canadians known as 'high-risk travelers' to the Canadian security forces, this despite earlier reports to the contrary.

Their investigation shows the young man arrived in Ottawa on October 2, to deal with securing a new passport, something his friends seem to back up in their statements about the young man.

'The passport was part of his motivation. His application was not rejected. His passport was not revoked,' said Paulson.

'He was waiting to get it and there was an investigation going on to determine to see whether he would get a passport.'

Abubakir Abdelkareem, 29, who often visited the Ottawa Mission, a homeless shelter downtown, said he met Zehaf-Bibeau there. 

He said Zehaf-Bibeau told him he had a drug problem in Vancouver but had been clean for three months.

Abdelkareem said that Zehaf-Bibeau wanted his passport to fly to Libya because he thought he could avoid drugs there. 

'As soon as I get it, I'm going to fly. ... Then there's no temptation,' Abdelkareem quoted him as saying.

But in the past three days, 'his personality changed completely,' Abdelkareem said. 

'He was not talkative; he was not social' anymore and slept during the day, said Abdelkareem, who concluded the man was back on drugs.

Lloyd Maxwell, another shelter resident, said that Zehaf-Bibeau had lived for some time in Vancouver, then Calgary, then came to Ottawa specifically to try to get a passport, believing that would be more easily accomplished in the nation's capital.

'He didn't get it, and that made him very agitated,' Maxwell said. 

Maxwell said that he suggested to the man that he might be on a no-fly list, and 'he kind of looked at me funny, and he walked away.'

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed on Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied recently for a passport, but said it believes he intended to go to Syria.

Earlier this week, the Mounties said that there are about 90 people in the country who are suspected of intending to join the extremist fighting abroad or who have returned from such activity overseas. But RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau was not among them.

Expressing horror and sadness at what happened, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother, Susan Bideau, said that her son seemed lost and 'did not fit in,' and that she hadn't seen him for more than five years until having lunch with him last week.

'So I have very little insight to offer,' she said.

Bibeau also said that she is crying for the victims of the shooting rampage, not her son.

'Can you ever explain something like this?' said Bibeau, who has homes in Montreal and Ottawa.

'We are sorry.'

After initially reporting that two or three assailants may have taken part in the shooting rampage, Canadian police conceded Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau was the lone gunman.

The bloodshed raised fears that Canada is suffering reprisals — perhaps so-called lone-wolf attacks — for joining the U.S.-led air campaign against Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria.
