Paparazzi are often wary of famous faces tiring of media attention and turning on them as Khloe Kardashian's husband Lamar Odom proved this week when he trashed a photographer's gear in a dramatic rampage.

The towering 6ft10 basketball player aggressively threw the photographer's equipment in the road while shouting... but these unpredictable beasts are a very different proposition.

Animal photographers have a whole different ball game if their subject decide to turn - they can be viciously attacked, maimed or even killed.

React: Animals are unpredictable to the photographers need to make sure they are able to react quickly to any aggressive behaviour

'As with anything there is an element of danger, but this is - after all - one of the reasons people are interested in the animals.

'As crazy as that might sound getting close to a predator is a thrilling experience.'

These pictures show nature photographers getting up close with snakes, cheetahs, rhinos and even lions, as they go to any lengths to get their perfect shots.

'The other guides and I are used to the animals and can read their signs of when they are stressed or had enough,' said Zane.

'The animals in these areas are all habituated which does not mean they are 'tame' but they are used to human interaction.

'As long as the guests are respectful of the animals space they are completely relaxed around people and do not alter their behaviour.

'If an animal does become irritated we will ask people to move away from the animal and give it some space.

'My main message to people when it comes to wildlife is to share it with each other as much as they can, as nature is there to be enjoyed and we should teach and learn as much as we can about the natural world.

'The more we all know about wildlife the better can understand how to protect it, and I believe photography is a perfect way to get people involved and excited about animals and the beauty of nature.'
