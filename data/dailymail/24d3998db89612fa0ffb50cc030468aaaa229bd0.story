America called for more military defections from Syria yesterday after a fighter pilot flew to Jordan and was given political asylum.

It was the first defection by a member of Syria's air force during the 15-month uprising against President Assad.

It is seen as a propaganda coup for the rebels because the air force has been viewed as fiercely loyal to the Assad regime

Washington 'welcomed' the defection and said it 'would not be the last'.

Syria denounced the airman, Colonel 
Hassan Hammadeh, 44, as a traitor and demanded their jet back â€“ an 
elderly Russian-made Mig 21.

Jordan said it had allowed the pilot 
to stay on 'humanitarian grounds' though it is anxious to avoid being 
drawn into the Syrian conflict.

It already has taken in 125,000 Syrian
refugees, including hundreds of army and police defectors, and Syria is
seeking their extradition.

Opposition sources said he had smuggled his family to Turkey before his dramatic defection.

'He (the pilot) requested political asylum in Jordan. He is being debriefed at the moment,' Jordanian Minister of State for Information Samih al-Maaytah said.

A Jordanian security source said the 
pilot flew from al-Dumair military airport northeast of Damascus and 
landed at the at King Hussein Airbase at 11am.

King
Hussein Airbase, named after the country's late monarch, is a military 
airport situated near the border with Syria, 50 miles northeast of the 
capital Amman.

Syrian state television named the pilot as Colonel Hassan Hamada.

It said communications were lost with his plane at 10.34am while he was on a training mission near the border with Jordan.

A Jordanian official described the defection as 'difficult to handle', referring to Amman's nervousness over possible a Syrian military reaction after months of border tension between the two countries.

It has been ignited by thousands of Syrians fleeing a crackdown on the revolt to Jordan.
