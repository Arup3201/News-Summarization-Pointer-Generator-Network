A priest who was severely injured during an attempted robbery inside his church managed to issue last rites to his fellow pastor who died from a gunshot wound following the senseless attack.

Father Kenneth Walker, 28, associate pastor at the Mother of Mercy Mission Catholic Church in Phoenix, Arizona, died in hospital after being shot on Wednesday night.  

Father Joseph Terra, the 56-year-old pastor at the church, was badly wounded but reportedly in a  stable condition today.

A fellow priest said it was his understanding that Father Terra was able to absolve and issue last rites for his young colleague despite his own extensive injuries.

Father Walker, originally from Maple Hill, Kansas, was ordained two years ago.

Reverend Fred Adamson, from the Catholic Diocese of Phoenix, told WNEM that the church did not have security but Father Terra was not afraid of anyone.

He said he believed that the 56-year-old priest was able to absolve and issue last rites for Father Walker, whom he had lived with for the past four years.

The burglary took place at 9pm local 
time, Phoenix Police 
Department spokesman Steve Martos said.

Father Joseph Terra, 56, was critically injured but managed to call 911 following the robbery

'Both victims are priests and the crime occurred in a living quarters attached to the church,' Officer Martos said.

He said that the attacks took place outside of the church's inner sanctum.

Father Terra managed to call 911 after the attack.

In the early hours of Thursday, parishioners gathered to pray outside the Mother of Mercy Mission Church.

Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said that the attacks on the two priests 'strikes at our core'.

So far no suspects have been located and no motive established but investigators were looking at surveillance cameras from the area surrounding the church, which is near the state Capitol. 

Police were waiting to also speak to Father Terra to find out more about the assailants.

Father Walker suffered a fatal gun shot wound and was pronounced dead at a hospital in Phoenix.

Father Terra suffered severe injuries and hospital staff were stunned that the priest was still able to communicate with them, the police spokeman said.

A statement from the archdiocese said: 'We are stunned and deeply saddened to learn of the tragic assault perpetrated last night against Fr. Joseph Terra and Fr. Kenneth Walker, two religious order priests who belong to the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter. Fr. Walker's life was taken. Fr. Terra remains in critical condition but stable.

'The reported attack occurred at Mater Misericordiae Mission in Phoenix. The police are still gathering information and trying to sort through the details of this senseless act of violence. We ask that people offer prayers for both priests, the religious community, their families and the parish. Eternal rest, grant unto him O Lord and let perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace.'

A green 2003 Mazda Tribute, which belonged to one of the priests, stolen from church property was later found unoccupied four blocks from the church.
