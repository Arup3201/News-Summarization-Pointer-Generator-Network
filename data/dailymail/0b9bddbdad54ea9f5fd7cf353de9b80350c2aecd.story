All bets are off for Britons from the moment they check-in for a holiday as beach body diets go by the wayside in favour of calorific indulgence at the airport and on the plane. 

New research has revealed that Britons consume an average of 3,402 calories between their arrival at the airport and landing at their destination, well above the NHS's recommended daily intake.  

Britons overindulge more than holidaymakers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany, who were also polled, saying their holiday began long before their arrival at their chosen destination.

The survey of 2,607 adults who had flown away for a holiday in the past 12 months shows the average Briton consumes between 900 and 1,400 more than health professionals say they should.

The results, collated by UK flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk, showed that the average Briton will consume 1,963 calories during this brief period in food and an additional 1,439 calories in alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks - a total of 3,402. 

Asked whether they felt they were over-indulging at the airport and in flight, a resounding 79 per cent said 'yes', with 53 per cent of respondents saying they were 'getting into the holiday spirit' and 28 per cent saying they 'no longer needing to diet for the holiday'. 

Germans come closest to Brits for pre-and-during flight consumption with a total of 3,107 calories, followed by travellers from Spain (2,350 calories), Italy (2,311 calories) and French (1,269 calories).

'These numbers are astonishing, particularly when you consider the average male should consume 2,500 calories per day and the average female just 2,000,' said  Jetcost.co.uk co-founder Antoine Michelat. 'Women are almost doubling their calorie intake within a matter of hours.'

Despite reaching for high-calorie treats during this brief period of their trip, Brits often save their pennies at the airport and on budget carriers that sell food. 

About a third of those polled (34 per cent) said they brought their own food from home with 68 per cent saying price from their main motivation, 45 per cent just want to be prepared, 42 per cent were eager not to eat into their holiday budget and 17 per cent had dietary requirements.

Sandwiches (37 per cent), crisps (31 per cent) and sweets/chocolates (25 per cent) were the most popular items taken to the airport by holiday makers, not the healthiest of options.  

While many choose to buy food on board, 34 per cent of Brits bring their own food from home

'We'd never recommend that anyone consume this many calories per day, let alone within such a short period of time,' added Michelat. 'Yes, we all like to have a blow out every now and then, but eating this much in one go is very bad for your waistline! This can be damaging for your health in many ways, particularly with regards to weight gain and conditions caused by weight gain.

'If you find yourself getting too carried away with food and drink, why not prepare your own food at home and limit yourself to that? If you're on a plane, there's a good chance that you're heading off on your holidays and you're about to have a period of time where you're going to overindulge for the duration, but try to think of the long term effects.'
