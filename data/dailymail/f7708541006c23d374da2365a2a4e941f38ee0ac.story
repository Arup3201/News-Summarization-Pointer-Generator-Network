Liverpool are hoping to agree a deal with Burnley for Danny Ings that would avoid the need for a tribunal when his contract ends in June.

Burnley have insisted Ings will not be leaving before the window closes but Liverpool are eager to sign the England Under 21 international.

Real Sociedad are also determined to land the 22-year-old and they would only have to pay £300,000 in compensation if they waited until the summer. 

Liverpool are keen to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings during this transfer window

The Reds do not want to become embroiled in a tribunal for the out-of-contract striker  

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is a firm admirer of Ings and rather than run the risk of missing out, the Reds are prepared to thrash out an agreement with Burnley.

The initial idea was for Liverpool to agree a deal with Burnley and then loan Ings back for the remainder of the season but that would have been a contravention of Premier League rules.

Burnley issued a statement on Friday saying that Ings was not for sale as the club focused their efforts on staying in the Barclays Premier League but there may yet be a twist.

If Liverpool are to do any business, it is most likely to be for Ings. There will be some minor outgoings, such as youngsters Sheyi Ojo and Ryan McLaughlin, but no major departures, at this point, are anticipated.
