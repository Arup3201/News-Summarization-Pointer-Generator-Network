This is the moment the habitual armed robber dubbed the Skull Cracker points his gun at the heads of staff as he robs a building society of almost £20,000 while on the run from open prison.

Michael Wheatley, 55, was handed his 14th life sentence yesterday - but could be out again in ten years.

He admitted holding up the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, four days after absconding from an open prison in Kent.

He was already serving 13 life sentences at the time, and failed to return from day release on May 3.Scroll down for video

Violent: Skull Cracker Michael Wheatley as he pointed a gun at staff while robbing a building society while on the run from an open prison

Criminal: Wheatley, jailed for life again yesterday, did not even cover his face as he committed yet another robbery in early May

Wheatley - who pleaded guilty to three offences related to the robbery - was jailed again at Guildford Crown Court, but the minimum term was set at 10 years, which means he will be eligible for parole by 2024.

On May 6 the manager of the building 
society he robbed had warned staff to be on their guard, having seen the media 
coverage of Wheatley's disappearance.

He entered early the next morning, posing as a man who had spent 20 years in Ireland and wanted to open a new account.

Jailed: Michael Wheatley, also known as the Skull Cracker, was given a 14th life sentence yesterday after pleading guilty to armed robbery

After
 twice coming in and chatting to deputy manager Christopher Gurdev, he 
was about to leave when he said 'one more thing", prosecutor Dale 
Sullivan told the court - 'At which point the defendant pulled out a 
handgun from within his jacket and pointed it at Mr Gurdev's head'.

The
 court was played CCTV from the robbery, which showed Wheatley forcing 
Mr Gurdev at gunpoint to unlock a door, take him into the back of the 
branch and hand him cash from a safe while shouting 'Give me the money'.

He also pointed the weapon at a female cashier.

Mr
 Sullivan said: 'The importance of the location of the robbery was that 
the branch was robbed by the defendant some 13 years ago.

'The
 manager had briefed her staff the night before about Wheatley, telling 
them to be aware of him because of the media coverage and his failure to
 return to Standford Hill'.

All
 but £850 of the money was recovered when Wheatley was arrested later 
the same day, Mr Sullivan said, but the gun, real or imitation, was 
never found.

He was captured on May 7 after four days on the run from the Category D Standford Hill prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.

During the Surrey raid he pointed a handgun at staff and made off with £18,350 - but was captured by police hours later in Tower Hamlets, East London.

Yesterday he pleaded guilty to robbery, possession of a firearm or imitation firearm while committing an offence, and being unlawfully at large.

The court heard that he previously robbed the same building society branch 13 years ago and staff had been told to be on their guard following his disappearance.

The court heard that Wheatley has spent a total of 46 years in institutions, starting at the age of six, and has been in prison on and off for most of his adult life.

Appearing
 via video-link from HMP Belmarsh in south east London, he showed no 
emotion and sat with his arms folded as Judge Christopher Critchlow 
passed sentence.

Judge
 Critchlow said it was a 'special case' because of Wheatley's prolific 
record of violent armed robberies and committing offences after being 
released from prison sentences.

Passing
 sentence, the judge told him: 'You went to the same branch which you 
robbed in about 2001. You therefore deliberately targeted this branch 
and planned this raid.

'You knew exactly what you were doing, having committed such crimes so many times. It is clear the public must be protected from you for a long time.'

The
 court heard that Wheatley has 23 previous convictions for robbery, two 
for attempted robbery and 18 for related firearms offences.

He was given his nickname after pistol-whipping innocent bystanders during previous robberies, including a 73-year-old woman.

Wheatley was sentenced on the basis that it was an imitation firearm.

Lionel Blackman, defending, said Wheatley went on the run after being refused parole after almost eight years in prison and then again last October.

He told the court Wheatley had been having therapy in prison in between parole attempts and had not applied while getting help.

But the therapy to deal with abuse he suffered as a child was stopped because of funding cuts last July, the court heard.

After his second failed parole attempt he was downgraded and moved to the Category D open prison.

Mr Blackman told the court: 'This is a case where a man has spent 46 of his 55 years in one institution or another'.

He continued: 'He was very much left to his own devices in the open prison. Not seeing on the horizon another opportunity to determine his release and disappointed not to achieve a release at seven and a half years or in October, he made the decision not to return to prison at all.

'The plan was to start a new life in Ireland. Regrettably he committed a robbery to fund that new life'.
