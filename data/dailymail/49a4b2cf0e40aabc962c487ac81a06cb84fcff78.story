French officials face a race against time to dispose of a beached whale - before it explodes with potentially fatal consequences.

The decaying 15-ton carcass has become so bloated with gas there is a high chance it could burst, wildlife experts have warned.

Authorities are now desperately trying to work out the best way of getting rid of it - and may even blow it up with dynamite.

Timebomb: French officials have been scratching their heads over how to dispose of this 15-ton beached whale which is at risk of exploding due to the build up of gas inside the animal

Risk: The decaying carcass has become so bloated with gas there is a high chance it could burst with potentially fatal consequences if anyone gets too close

The whale washed up on the beach at Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer, near Montpellier on the Mediterranean coast

Road access to the whale has been blocked and the area cordoned off to prevent people approaching or touching it.

Video from last year showing a whale exploding in similar circumstances showed just how dangerous - and potentially fatal - it could be.

The whale washed up on the beach at Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer, near Montpellier on the Mediterranean coast in early November.

Anais Cheiron, project manager of the national reserve of Camargue, said: 'Because of the heat, gases form inside the cadaver – hence, the bulging appearance of the whale.

'They accumulate until they explode.'

Easy does it: Marine biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen approaches a 45ft whale with an extra-long sharp knife in this video from last year after it washed up n a beach in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic

Mr Mikkelsen tried to cut open the sperm whale carcass which exploded in his face in November 2013

When an animal dies, bacteria inside the carcass produce methane as part of the decomposition process.

If this is not let out of the body gradually it builds up, exploding at the first opportunity.

Whales are the most extreme because their huge size makes the consequences of a gas build-up so much greater.

Living toads in Hamburg, Germany, started spontaneously combusting in 2005. 

It was thought crows were picking out their livers, leaving a hole, so when the toads puffed themselves up as a defence mechanism, their whole bodies burst.

And Royal funeral attendants hurriedly drilled a hole in the coffin of the overweight English king George IV to let out gases - after an apparent botched embalming job. 

The whale could be dragged out to sea and detonated using dynamite, he told daily newspaper Midi Libre, according to The Local.

But he said boats may not be able to get close enough to tow it because of sand banks nearby.

The other option would be to pop the carcass and cut it into pieces before loading it onto a van. 

Last year, the dangers of exploding whale carcasses were made all-too clear when a marine biologist was captured on gruesome video trying to cut one open - which exploded all over him.

The sperm whale was one of two which died last November after beaching in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic.

The creatures died after becoming trapped in a narrow channel, and residents of the 50,000-strong Danish community wanted to use the skeleton of one for a museum.

So it fell to unlucky Bjarni Mikkelsen, a marine biologist at the National Museum of the Faroe Islands, to cut open the carcass yesterday.

He had never cut open a whale before so he approached the pungent 45ft corpse gingerly.

As soon as he began working, the gas trapped inside exploded, spewing tons of organs and guts into the air.

The main part of the huge blast just missed him. 

Organs: Mr Mikkelsen stands apparently stunned as the whale's insides fly into the air in front of him

Gruesome: By the time the worker on the Faroe Islands turned round to escape, it was too late

He told MailOnline: 'The animal was more than two days old when we took it so we knew there would be some pressure on the inside, but nothing like what happened.  

'We couldn't imagine it would happen like that so it was a little bit more of a surprise.

'It wasn't a shock. We had expected something. In the situation I was more worried about something worse happening or anyone getting hurt.

'We were cutting along the dorsal part of the animal so when it exploded it did so in a very controlled way.

'It was very loud, I suppose. It's something everyone here is talking about.'
