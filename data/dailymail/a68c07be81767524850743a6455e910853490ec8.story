A toddler's father has accidentally sliced off one of her feet with a lawnmower.

Eighteen-month-old Roseanne Mendez was playing in her family's garden in North Fresno, California on December 7 as her father, Reyes Mendez, trimmed the edges of the grass.

The youngster was climbing on a swing set with her siblings and she came off the slide, the lawnmower cut off her foot, KMPH reported.

Mr Mendez ran to a nearby house and frantically asked neighbor Lisa Bertelsen to call 911.

Recovering: Eighteen-month-old Roseanne Mendez, pictured left in hospital and right with her mother, lost a foot to her father's lawnmower as he was cutting the grass near her slide earlier this month

'I came to their front yard,' she recalled to KMPH. 'Mom handed me the baby with a blood soaked towel on her foot.' 

The little girl was flown to UC San Francisco's Pediatric Unit and her foot was kept in a bag of ice.

When she arrived, doctors tried to reattach her foot but it wouldn't take. She continues to recover in hospital as her family stay nearby.

Her father, the family's breadwinner, has not been able to work since the accident and although they are staying at a Ronald McDonald House next to the hospital, they still need to pay for food.

Fresno Police Officer Paige McQuay, who responded to the call on December 7, has been fundraising for the family, which has four children. He recalled how he was deeply affected when he arrived at the scene following the call.

Accident: Police said no one was to blame for the freak accident. The family's lawnmower is pictured

On the mend: Roseanne was flown to a San Francisco hospital but doctors were unable to reattach the foot

'Immediately you start thinking about your children,' the father-of-five said. 'It could happen to anybody, any family.'

He said that after the accident, he wondered how the family would get by. 

'I knew the family was going to be hurting for money,' he said. 'I decided it would be beneficial to do what I could to encourage other people to help.'

One of his daughter decorated mason jars with signs reading, 'The Roseanne Mendez Get Well Fund', and places them throughout police stations.

A week later, they had raised more than $600 in the jars and the Fresno Police Chaplaincy also donated another $1,000 to the family.

Shock: Fresno Police Officer Paige McQuay, who responded to the scene, said he worried how the family would get by after the accident because Roseanne's father stopped working so he could be near the hospital

Thankful: He has raised thousands of dollars for the family and delivered it to them in the hospital at the weekend (pictured). He said the family were overwhelmed by the generosity of the public

McQuay personally delivered the money to the family in San Francisco on Sunday, and although the parents do not speak English, he said he could see how appreciative they were. 

'I could see them start shaking their heads and crying,' he said. Obviously they are sincerely, grateful for the help they are being given, without asking.'

A gofundme page has also been set up to raise funds for the girl and her family.

Police said no one is to blame for the 'freak' accident and that no charges will be brought.
