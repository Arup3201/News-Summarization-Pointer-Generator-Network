These photos of four to ten-day-olds were all captured by newborn portrait photographers Dan Cuellar and Heidi Belle, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The pair have photographed hundreds of tots since they started their business in 2008. Each session takes between 30 minutes and four hours.  

Dan and Heidi say they have been inundated with requests from parents to have their spring babies photographed.

Dan, 30, said: 'Spring is usually a really busy season for us. At this time of year we get lots of requests from parents.'

He added: 'You can’t really just ask a baby to do something.

'The trick to photographing newborns is really just waiting, keeping them warm and full.

'Once they are in a deep sleep you 
can pose them without waking them. You need to have a lot of patience 
and be willing to wait for the right moment.

'The age of the child is also very important. It’s usually best to photograph them when they are under two weeks old. 

'The first 10 days are best for getting the cute curly poses and longer amounts of deep sleep to pose and style them.

'After 10 days of age, they are more likely to be disturbed while sleeping.'
