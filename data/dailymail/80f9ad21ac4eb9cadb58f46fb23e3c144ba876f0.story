A strong 6.4 magnitude earthquake has reportedly struck New Zealand’s South Island with thousands of people feeling its impact.

GeoNet said the quake struck 35km north of the Canterbury town of Methven at about 6.48am on Tuesday, but both police and the Fire Service say they have not yet had any damage reports.

More than 2000 people have reported feeling the quake, some as far away as the North Island, GeoNet said.

The website reported there have been more than 20 aftershocks so far following the first earthquake, with the strongest reaching a magnitude of 4.2.

The quake’s epicentre was about 100 kilometres west of Christchurch, the ABC reports.

Christchurch suffered a devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquake that killed 185 people in 2011.

Buildings continued to collapse for hours after the quake struck because of aftershocks and witnesses said the ground 'moved like a wave'. Horrified, they saw buildings full of people crumble.

The quake was  the country's deadliest natural disaster for 80 years.

One witness to the quake, who is staying in Castle Hill, about 15km from the epicentre, told Nine News: ‘We were in bed when it happened and it lasted for about 15-20 seconds.’

One Twitter user, Martha Craig, wrote: 'Here at Kowai Bush near the earthquake’s centre. We’re fine, didn’t feel violent enough to break anything.'

'Nothing fell. Mind you we’re in the most charming bach and cocooned like babies. No more earthquakes now please,' she added. 

Due to continuing collision between the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates, New Zealand -  part of a geographic are named the Pacific ‘Ring Of Fire’ - records more than 14,000 earthquakes a year.

However, only about 150 are felt by residents and fewer than ten a year do any damage.
