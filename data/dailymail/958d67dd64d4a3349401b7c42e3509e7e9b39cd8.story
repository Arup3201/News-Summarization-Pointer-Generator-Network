A train security guard, who was allegedly the subject of a vile onslaught of racial abuse from a passenger, has received an outpouring of support from the community.

'Joe' has been commended for 'holding his own in a professional and peaceful manner' as a teenager, who has now been charged along with another man, hurled a tirade of abuse at the guard on a Brisbane train with the shocking footage going viral.

It shows a teenager screaming obscenities at the Queensland Rail Security guard, who is from Zimbabwe, after he was told to take his feet off the seat just before midnight at Indooroopilly station last week.

'The man 'Joe' who was from Zimbabwe has been 'overwhelmed' by the incident.'

'It is one of the challenges of living in Australia but when there is an attack on a member of our communities we go through all the channels to try and find the culprit.  

'Joes' employers, Securecorp, who are contracted by Queensland Rail, say they are extremely proud of 'Joe' in a 'de-escalating situation'.

'Securecorp would like to highlight and commend in particular, our security customer service officer who was personally subjected to this abuse on his 'professional conduct and adhering to correct protocol whilst managing the situation in regards to the safety of all involved,' said Securecorp's Craig Harwood.

'SECUREcorp would also like to thank the passengers and the general public for their support in this matter.'

'We were pleased to hear that the offenders have been charged by Queensland Police,' they said.

'We would like to thank members of the community who have left many messages of support on our social media sites.'

One facebooker said she has traveled on the Ipswich to Rosewood line with Joe on patrol many times and credited him on doing an excellent job.

'Well done security guard 'Joe' for holding his own in a professional and peaceful way,' she said.

'Thankyou for the long hours you work 'Joe' and for ensuring a safe environment for us all on the train.

Another said he wanted to pass on his regrets to the fellow 'Joe' who was vilified by a detestable 'young pup'.

'Joe' has more than earned our respect and admiration, with the admirable restraint and dignity he has shown.'

The vile incident has sparked rage within the community, a facebook page called 'Man Hunt To Find Racist Kader Boumzar' has been set up.

Before the teen was charged it said, 'If there is anyone who knows where this pr**k lives, his phone number or anything. Post it here. He has to apologize and suffer for his actions. He was very keen to fight the security guard. Lets see how good his fighting skills are.'

A woman who made a comment on one of the posts said her husband also worked for rail security, the same company as 'Joe'.

'This poor guard that was involved is a fantastic person that really didn't deserve this s**t to happen. Man this d**kh**d should never step foot on Queensland rail again! All the guards know who he is!'  

The rail spokesperson said staff were working with police to ensure safety and security was a priority across the network.

'Their right to come to work and be treated respectfully is something we take very seriously and a right everyone deserves.'

'We hope that this sends a message to those who disregard that right.' 

Queensland Rail wanted to also remind passengers that more than 8200 CCTV cameras are installed across the rail network including railway squad police officers, mobile security, dog patrols and transit officers who are patrolling. 

Kader Boumzar, a 17-year-old Brisbane man has been charged with two counts each of assault occasioning bodily harm and creating a nuisance on a railway and one count each of threatening violence, common assault and using a carriage service to menace or harass.

An 18-year-old Ipswich man has been charged with one count of creating a nuisance on a railway.

Both men are due to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court Monday.

The vile incident has even prompted a response from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who slammed the teenager in the video, labeling his behaviour as 'deplorable'.

Mr Abbott said he had been briefed about the incident, which he labelled as 'un-Australian', by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman.

'Just as I think it's un-Australian to defend death cults, I think it's un-Australian to abuse people in a public place just because you don't like the way they look, or you don't like the way they dress, or you make assumptions about what they believe,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Brisbane on Sunday. 

Mr Campbell who spoke to 'Joe' personally about the incident said he conveyed two things to the guard.

'Firstly, I thought he showed admirable restraint. I think he, from what I could see, responded very professionally in what was a very difficult situation and I have thanked him for his great job as part of the Queensland Rail team,' he said.

'Secondly, I have conveyed to him my absolute disgust at what he was subjected to. I've told him how totally unacceptable it was.'

'And I have said that whether or not he makes a complaint is up to him but I have assured him that on behalf of him and indeed the entire Queensland Rail team that we will be going after the individual or perhaps other individuals responsible for this racist attack.'

'It' s not on. It's unacceptable.'
