All Blacks fly half Aaron Cruden believes there will be added spice to Saturday’s opening Test against England because of New Zealand’s humiliating defeat at Twickenham in 2012.

Cruden's side had no answers in the 38-21 rout by England and the 25-year-old feels the result - their only defeat in 35 games - is still fresh in the mind of the Kiwi public.

This summer's tour is England’s first visit to New Zealand since that famous encounter and Stuart Lancaster’s understrength side must be prepared to feel the full force of the All Blacks at Eden Park, where the hosts are bidding to defend a 20-year unbeaten record.

Needle: New Zealand's Aaron Cruden believes there will be added spice to the opening Test against England

‘Our supporters and our fans know who the last side to beat us were and they fully understand the threat this English side possess,’ Cruden told Sportsmail.

‘It’s massive for us; rugby is the number one sport in New Zealand. The media are saying this is an understrength English side, but we don’t see that as the case at all. When they pull on the English jersey we know they will do everything they can to get the result for their team.’

‘We’ve got a pretty handy record at Eden Park but it’s something we don’t often talk about. It seems to be a bit of a fortress for us and hopefully that can continue.’

Cruden has taken over the No 10 jersey in place of New Zealand icon Dan Carter, who is playing no part in the three-Test Series following a sabbatical.

The 25-year-old will line up against Freddie Burns and, while team-mate Brodie Retallick was unable to name one England player earlier in the week, Cruden has clearly been doing some homework on his opposite number.

‘Freddie made his debut against us a couple of years ago and I’ve watched a bit of his footage,’ said Cruden. ‘He’s a good player; he’s got a sound right-footed kicking game and he’s a really good organiser. We’ve got to be aware of the threat that he poses and try to shut him down as much as we can.

Know all about him: The hosts kept a close eye on Danny Cipriani while he was with the Melbourne Rebels

‘We saw Danny Cipriani a little bit with his time at the Melbourne Rebels, but we don’t get to see as much of Freddie playing back in the UK. We just have to do our preparation and make sure we’re ready for whatever they throw at us.’

England coach Stuart Lancaster has had to turn to fringe players such as Burns, Rob Webber, James Haskell and Kyle Eastmond in the absence of regular starters from Saracens and Northampton.

They will all be hoping to make their mark and, similarly, Cruden also sees Saturday’s Test as an opportunity to put up his hand for a run of games in the starting jersey.

The 25-year-old edged out Beauden Barrett in selection and his long-term target is to challenge Carter to be first choice at next year’s Rugby World Cup.

‘You always want to be in that starting XV and I’m really excited and grateful to get the start this weekend,’ said Cruden. ‘For me it’s a case of understanding my role within the team and, whether I’m starting or on the bench, I just have to put my best foot forward and push my claim to get that starting jersey.

‘I looked up to Dan growing up a youngster and now to be able to rub shoulders, pick his brain and ask questions can only be beneficial for my game. The healthy competition that we have within the squad now really encourages you to keep getting better every day.’

Tough ask: Stuart Lancaster must cajole one of England's biggest performances in order to get anything
