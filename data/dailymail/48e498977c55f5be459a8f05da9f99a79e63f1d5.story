Once the laminated book of dreams, the Argos catalogue has been every child's Christmas companion since it first emerged in the 1970s.

A treasure trove of cutting-edge gadgets and must-have toys, it was the bible of the day's popular culture.

People would eagerly flick through the synthetic pages with a pen compiling a detailed list of product codes for Father Christmas to reference.

Throwback: This 1973 edition of the iconic catalogue is a telling glimpse into the fads of the day, and the nation's tastes. A secure family unit was a key marketing feature

In 2013, the front cover is cleared of smiling children and loving parents to make way for glitzy gadgets and bright colours with an advert for where to do your shopping

70s prices: Back then, a rowing machine would only set you back £13.95, compared to prices nearing £200 today. The models look like they're having a playful time

Now, exercise is a solitary activity, and the model looks strained; pushed to the limit. Compared to the basic stock in 1976, there are pages of equipment to choose from now

Three decades ago, the toys pages were void of beaming children and shiny colours to inspire their young shoppers. The pictures and toys are simple

Now, children want their own miniature versions of real-life cars like Mini Coopers that they can drive around with a remote control

Nostalgia: Vintage collector Anthony Voz was amazed by the reactions from nostalgic shoppers when he shared the images of this dull-coloured 1976 edition online

1976 Index: For shoppers desperate to flick straight to bread bins, dress forms, eternity rings, valet stands and typewriters, here are the pages

Children would sift through the wad of cutting-edge toys to note down product codes for Father Christmas. The news that the catalogues are ending was met with uproar

Sign of the times: The Six Million Dollar Man was one of the nation's favourite imports from America, and the figurine was essential for young boys. Ricochet Racers were loved but faulty

When store directors this year announced plans to go digital in the near future, millions of nostalgic shoppers were dismayed.

But today, in a wistful tribute to the institution, a collector has unveiled one of the store's first catalogues before the marketing revolution disappears into history.

And they offer an incredible glimpse into the ever-changing tastes of British shoppers.

In the booklet, found in a carboot sale by vintage collector Anthony Voz, models with Farah Fawcett-flicked locks and glossed lips and men with helmet hair and Adidas tracksuits posed with the 1976 must-haves, from instamatic Kodak cameras to metal typewriters and gas coal-effect fires.

Just three decades on, typewriters are vintage collectors items that can cost hundreds. These are as little as £29.95. And a box advertises £1 gift vouchers for a wedding present

Writers today need a laptop, which can cost £399.99 if you're lucky. The curved edges and soft, pastel colours of typewriters have been replaced with harsh edges and sleek black

No house was complete without a record player. The catalogue puts a great deal of emphasis on on manual control of the sound on there £25 machines

Before the advent of iPods and mp3 players, a portable radio was the must-have accessory for young things walking around Britain. The chunky devices were considered lightweight

Dramatic change: With technological advances, stereos can now be all shapes and sizes - usually enormous and dwarfing the sleek little iPhone nestled inside it

The whole booklet is a vision of orange and brown, featuring homes brimming with Ercol furniture and patio sun loungers, complete with bronzed men in blinding white exercise gear.

Customers are invited to by state-of-the-art twin turntables on which to play all those early Elton John LPs, listened to through wooden speakers (brown, of course).

It was the year of bell-bottom jeans, Rod Stewart, ABBA, and disco.

Cassette tapes took off, and people without a walkman strapped to their pocket simply weren't worth the time of day.

Alternative and herbal medicines such as acupuncture started moving into Britain and from China as the nation embraced spirituality.

Glass eating and star wars action figures also made their debut.

'Super' was the word on the street, where the trendy young things wore jackets inspired by The Fonz from Happy Days.

Watches are glistening gold and opulent - compared to today's practical, sleek, black gadgets.

Typewriters, adding machines, cassette players and ashtrays are just some of the things that either no longer appear or have a minimal amount of space now dedicated to them.

But it is not only gadgets which have changed, as the pictures also show how far the nation's obsession with body image and personal grooming has developed since the 1970s.

Whereas the 70s version shows a happy family gathered around the catalogue, the cover of the 2013 edition shows a tablet PC displaying the Argos website and a range of online purchasing options.

The contents pages of the old catalogue list just one page of 'Keep Fit equipment', whereas the 2011 version has a staggering 40 pages of various sports gear.

And while today's man looks for an electric razor which moisturises his skin as he shaves, a sideburn trimming feature was the USP which attracted the rugged 70s bloke.

When it was launched in 1973, Argos revolutionised the way we shopped.

Back then — before the computer age, and when there was only one commercial TV channel on which to advertise — the catalogue was a quick and inspiring way to reach customers at home.

The original allure of the catalogue was in its aspirational products and fantasy homes — all of which was in your grasp, with a little help from Argos.

While browsing the pages at home, you could compare these fabulous homes and the happy families in them with your own living room and life, which suddenly seemed somewhat lacking.

Having scanned and uploaded every single page, Mr Voz has shared the images which shed light on the way we used to live.

And he was overwhelmed by the response from people who had fond childhood memories of the products featured within.

He said: 'The images act as a way to connect with people to discover their stories, their past and their memories.

'For example, people see teddy bears that they owned, or games consoles that they longed to own as a teenager and the catalogues also shed light into how it was to live back then.

'Looking at the catalogues makes people remember parts of their life that they had forgotten.

'It is sad that the catalogues are being phased out but I guess it is a sign of the times.

'In many ways catalogue shopping was a radical approach back in the day and it has slowly been replaced by the web.

Vintage collectors now clamour for items like the Halina camera, top right, which went for £3.95 in 1976 and with film would be more than 20 times the price today

Shiny: Glittering colours, swirling patterns and optical zooms are the order of the day today and the page design crams far more information in around the cut-out images

The Highriser bike was at its height of popularity for teenagers to cruise around the streets, advertised by cyclist Hugh Porter, sporting some timely sideburns

Now: Style has been shunned for substance as customers are now given close-up views of the bike's suspension and details of the gear type

Gold: Accessories were glamourous in 1976, and there was never such a thing as too much gold. The layout is reminiscent of a jeweller's store, with simple boxed photos

Multi-purpose: Now, gold is gone. Watches are a practical device that can tell you the date, time, your location, and hydration levels. They resist water and have in-built alarms

The Man-Styler, which sold for £11.95, was a heavy-duty hairdressing kit for those bouffant manes that ABBA and Elton John inspired in the 1970s

Edgy: Grooming has now lost its soft, feathered edge in favour of lasers, bright lights and photoshopped graphics - and prices rocketing past £200

Playthings: The must-have toys of the day were air hostess dolls and Brownie dolls. There is also the first sign of 'tiny tears' dolls which drink, cry and wet their nappies

The tiny tears toys are still a favourite today, but marketed with an adorable young girl, and a tumult of extra accessories

'It is all about technology making things even more convenient and easy for the customer now.

'Let's see if it works out as great as the catalogues.'

Earlier this year Argos revealed plans to launch six 'digital only' stores which would do away with the traditional catalogue seen at its other 732 outlets in the UK and Ireland.

This month the stores attracted controversy after customers reserved items online for instore pick-up, only to find them closed when they arrived.
