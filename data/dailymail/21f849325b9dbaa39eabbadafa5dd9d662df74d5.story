The fact that Bryan Bedder even made it to a hospital is incredible.

Now able to feel his legs, doctors are astounded.

The revered celebrity photographer was surfing between jobs at Art Basel in Miami on December4 when he slipped, fractured his C5 vertebrae, and fell into paralysis. 

But one month in bed couldn't tear him away from his camera.

As part of his motor skills therapy, he has taken photographs of every single visitor who has come to his side since he was transferred to his home city of New York.

Journey: Bryan Bedder was left paralyzed after he fractured his C5 vertebrae while surfing on December 4

Documentation: As part of his rehabilitation, Bedder has photographed every visitor - mainly fellow snappers

It took days of practice to even pick up a camera.

The moving shots posted to Bryan's Instagram page include numerous photographers and photojournalists, as well as his wife Shawness Prestidge, young daughter Marlow, mother, and brothers - who gave him a shave.

Bryan remains in a head brace and doctors have no clear diagnosis of when or if he will fully recover.

After plummeting into a sand bar on the beach, Bryan remembers taking a breath then blacking out - with his face in the water. 

A trip outside: Bedder's melancholic photographs capture his slow, difficult journey through photos of others

Artistic: He had been in Miami for Art Basel shooting celebrities and art for the photo company Getty Images

The other side of the lens: Many of his subjects are usually behind the lens, like photojournalist Tony Behar

Friends: Bedder has been supported by friends, including photographer Michael Loccisano, throughout

Moving: The images, such as this of painter Jimmy Sheehan, capture day to day life in the New York hospital

Each photo captures the subject plus clinical elements of the hospital, like the poster behind Mark Von Holden

Strangers spotted him and rushed to pull him out of the water, saving his life. 

According to Shawness, spinal surgery has helped bring feeling back to his legs.

The biggest hurdle now is his hands.

'Bryan's leg movement, very suddenly came back in a big way,' Shawness wrote on Bryan's GoFundMe page. 'So we are feeling very positive about that.'

Recovering: Bedder can now feel his legs after undergoing spinal surgery and rehabilitation sessions

Devoted father: He has been helped along by his young daughter Marlow, who is regularly with him in the ward

Support: His wife Shawnelle Prestidge is with him every step of the way helping him raise funds for treatment

'Helping mom stay hydrated in Miami': This is a shot of Bedder showing his strength very soon after his fall

Brotherly love: His brothers came to visit and give Bedder a shave while in his hospital bed

She continued: 'It's his hands and fingers that will be his biggest challenge. 

'This poses the greatest hurdle considering that Bryan is a photographer. 

'He is so determined, that I know his sheer will is going to propel him to work HARDER than ever... but his triumphs may still fall short...

'So if there are any C5 photographers out there, please let us know your suggestions.'
