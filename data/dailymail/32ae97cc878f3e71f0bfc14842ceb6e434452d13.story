Al Qaeda claimed responsibility yesterday for the kidnapping of a 70-year-old American aid worker in Pakistan in August, and issued a series of demands for his release.

In a video message posted on militant websites, Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri said Warren Weinstein would be released if the U.S. stopped airstrikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.

He also demanded the release of all Al Qaeda and Taliban suspects around the world.

Concern is mounting over the fate of kidnapped American contractor Warren Weinstein

'Just as the Americans detain all whom
they suspect of links to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, even remotely, we 
detained this man who is neck-deep in American aid to Pakistan since the
1970s,' al-Zawahri said, according to a translation provided by the 
SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant messages.

The 31-minute video appeared on Jihadi websites, according to SITE.

'I tell the captive soldiers of Al 
Qaeda and the Taliban and our female prisoners held in the prisons of 
the crusaders and their collaborators: "We have not forgotten you, and 
in order to free you we have taken hostage the Jewish American Warren 
Weinstein,' al-Zawahiri continues.

He then goes on to directly challenge U.S. President Barack Obama.

'Obama has the power, capacity and 
authority to free,' al-Zawahiri said. 'He could also leave him in 
captivity for years and, if he does something stupid, kill him.'

'Your problem is not with us but with
(U.S. President Barack) Obama. We have raised fair demands ... So 
continue to pressure Obama, if you want your relative to be handed 
back,' Zawahri said, addressing Weinstein’s family.      

Zawahri
said the group’s demands for Weinstein’s release included the release 
of all those held by the United States at the Guantanamo detention 
centre and all others imprisoned for ties to al Qaeda or the 
Taliban.

He
also demanded and an end to air strikes by the United States and its 
allies against militants in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia and
Gaza.  

Zawahri
also demanded the release of high-profile militants including Ramzi 
Yousef, imprisoned in the United States for the 1993 bombing of the 
World Trade Center, and Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, serving a life 
sentence for plotting to attack the United Nations headquarters and 
other New York City landmarks.          

Mr Weinstein was abducted by at least eight armed men from his house in the eastern city of Lahore on August 13.

The house was protected by security 
but the captors were able to overpower and tied up Mr Weinstein's three 
guards, and pistol-whipped his driver.

Weinstein,
about 70 years old, had been working on a project in Pakistan’s 
northwestern tribal areas where Pakistani troops have been battling 
Islamist insurgents for years.       

Police and U.S. officials have not 
publicly said who they believed was holding him, but Islamist militant 
groups were the main suspects.

Mr Weinstein, who has a home in Rockville, Maryland, worked in Pakistan for several years and spoke Urdu.

He was the country director in 
Pakistan for J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S.-based firm that advises a 
range of Pakistani business and government sectors.

Mr Weinstein is experienced in foreign aid work, and was in Pakistan on an economic development project.

He had returned to Lahore the night before he was kidnapped from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.

He had told his staff that would be 
wrapping up his latest project and moving out of Pakistan, police 
official Tajammal Hussain told AP.

Mr Weinstein is based in Lahore and 
has been in Pakistan for seven years. The company headquarters' website 
describes Weinstein as a development expert with 25 years experience and
a Ph.D. in international law and economics.

He was in charge of a program that has been trying to help strengthen the competitiveness of various Pakistani industries.

The company has said Mr Weinstein is 
in poor health and provided a detailed list of medications, many of them
for heart problems, that it implored the kidnappers to give him.

'He's a short, funny man with a quick wit,' said Raza Rumi, a Pakistani journalist who last saw Mr Weinstein about a year ago.

'He's a very laid-back guy, not too worried about security issues, not really paranoid at all.'

Al-Zawahri took over Al Qaeda this 
year after Osama Bin Laden was killed in May by U.S. SEALs at his 
hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad.

Twelve days after Mr Weinstein's 
abduction on August 13, Lahore police said he had been freed, but they 
then retracted the claim.

Militant organisations frequently 
target foreigners in Pakistan, although it is rare for assailants to 
stage such a raid on a victim's home.

Kidnappings for ransom also are common
in Pakistan, with most of the victims being Pakistani. Criminal gangs 
are suspected in most of the abductions, though militant groups also are
believed to use the tactic to fund themselves through ransoms.

Americans in Pakistan are considered 
especially at risk from militant attack because the Taliban in the 
country oppose Islamabad's alliance with Washington and the U.S.-led war
in Afghanistan.

U.S. diplomats, aid workers and others are urged to take strong security precautions.

Lahore is the capital of the eastern 
Punjab province, a region bordering India that is home to several of 
Pakistan's top militant networks, some of which are suspected of ties to
Pakistani intelligence. Major attacks in Lahore include a 2009 ambush 
of Sri Lanka's cricket team that killed six police and a driver.

The unilateral American raid that 
killed Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden on May 2 in the northwest 
Pakistani town of Abbottabad further soured ties between the two 
countries and led to increased scrutiny on Americans living in Pakistan.
