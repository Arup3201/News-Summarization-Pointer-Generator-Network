One in three hospital consultants is now trained overseas, a report reveals.

The figure, a record high, is up from about one in four a decade ago and exposes the continual reliance of foreign medical staff in the NHS.

Senior medics in UK hospitals come from at least 108 countries – and the figure may be even higher, according to a House of Lords report.

The revelation comes amid warnings that patients are being put at risk because of language problems, poor training and a lack of understanding of British culture.

In September 2002, some 6,213 of the NHS’s 26,408 consultants came from overseas – a proportion of 23.5 per cent.

Ten years on, 13,208 of the 39,409 consultants in state-run hospitals are trained abroad – a new high of 33.5 per cent.

It means the number of foreign consultants has now soared by 112.3 per cent, while the numbers of their UK-trained colleagues has risen by just 29.7 per cent.

The figures, revealed in a  parliamentary question answered by health minister Earl Howe, also showed how NHS consultants were trained in at least 108 different countries.

The highest number come from India, with 5,122 – one in eight – trained on the sub-continent. Pakistan is next with 904 consultants, followed by Ireland on 848.

South Africa provides 765 consultants, Nigeria 576, Egypt 556 and Germany 506. 

There are now 408 Iraqi consultants working in the health service, 353 from Sri Lanka and 246 from Australia.

More
 and more doctors from debt-hit southern European countries still 
reeling from the euro crisis have also started working in the NHS.

Some 238 are from Italy, 205 from Spain and 189 from Greece. Another 186 were trained in Poland.

A total of 204 consultants do not have their country of origin recorded, meaning the total number of countries could be higher than 108.

 What is it about the Government that they can't train enough doctors here?

- Douglas Carswell

There are also 133 consultants from what is described as ‘West Indies associated states’, which includes a group of independent countries such as Antigua, Dominica, Grenada and Saint Lucia.

Leading cancer surgeon J Meirion Thomas recently condemned the ‘scandal’ of high numbers of foreign consultants when hundreds of eligible British students are turned down at over-subscribed UK medical schools.

Far too many had poor language skills, knew nothing about British culture and had not received rigorous and up-to-date training in their own country, he said.

He quoted a General Medical Council survey that said foreign-trained doctors were up to four times more likely to be suspended or struck off than their UK colleagues.

Last night Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘I’d rather be treated by a doctor born overseas than no doctor at all. But there is a chronic shortage of doctors in this country, so what is it about the Government that they can’t train enough here?’ 

A Labour source said recruiting from overseas is ‘incredibly expensive and often short-sighted’.

The Department for Health said the new training body, Health Education England, would ensure more UK-trained doctors to ensure a more ‘self-sufficient NHS’.
