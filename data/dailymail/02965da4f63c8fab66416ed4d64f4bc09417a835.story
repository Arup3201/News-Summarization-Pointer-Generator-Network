Two sisters of an Iowa state representative have been found dead of apparent gunshot wounds in the Pittsburgh home they shared, and police are investigating the case as a double homicide.

The bodies of 44-year-old Susan Wolfe and 38-year-old Sarah Wolfe were found Friday afternoon in their basement after they didn't show up for work, authorities said. Police found Sarah Wolfe's car around 1:15 a.m. Saturday parked nearly a mile away.

Sarah Wolfe was a psychiatrist for Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, and Susan Wolfe was a teacher's aide at Hillel Academy in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.

Pittsburgh police Lt. Daniel Herrmann said they don't have a motive for the killings, and there were no signs of forced entry. Family members, most of whom live in Iowa, said they're still trying to figure out what happened.

A sister, Mary Wolfe, is an Iowa Democratic state representative. Her website says she is the oldest of eight children, six girls and two boys.

On her Facebook page Saturday night, Rep. Wolfe thanked friends, neighbors and colleagues for their support.

'We are so grateful,' she wrote. 'Heartbroken, but grateful.'

The medical examiner's office has not released causes of death, but police say it appears the women had been shot.

'They're complex cases,' Medical Examiner Karl Williams said Saturday. "... Things change, 
bruising patterns change, different things if you wait a little while.

'We
 do it fairly routinely if we think we may be able to see other patterns
 of injury develop after a period of time,' Dr. Williams told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

On Thursday, Susan went to work at the Hillel Academy at the normal time - about 7:25 a.m. - and left about 5 p.m., apologizing that she couldn't stay late because she had an appointment at 5:30.

'[Susan always went to work] eager to start the day, greeted the children at the door, read them 
books while waiting for other children to arrive ... Her smile was 
infectious. She approached every day with optimism,' Dori Oshlag, the director of the center, said.

On Friday, when Susan didn't show up for work, Oshlag got nervous and began calling her house about 8:20 a.m. but got no answer. Text messages and emails also went unanswered.

'And by noon, myself and the staff and administration realized we had to 
make a difficult call to ask for help. The rest is history,' she said.

By noon, Oshlag and other friends who'd noticed the women were missing, started calling police. Authorities performed a wellness check just after 1 p.m. and found the bodies.

Each sister was pronounced dead at 1:48 p.m. Friday.

On Saturday, authorities found Sarah Wolfe's vehicle parked on the street about a mile from the home she shared with her sister.Â 

Each of the sisters had an excellent reputation amongst those who knew them best.

Sarah Wolfe's boyfriend, Matthew Bucholz, posted a note on Facebook describing his deceased girlfriend as a 'beautiful, brilliant funny woman who worked as a children's 
psychiatrist and was an old school riot "grrrl."...This whole thing is 
unimaginably sad.'

Authorities say they are not looking at Bucholz as a suspect in the murders.

Sarah Wolfe's former landlord described her as a dream tenant who often put her February rent in Valentines Day cards, and who baked cakes and brought them over to her house for no special reason.

'We were just so happy to have her,' former landlord Kelly Carter told the paper.. 'She turned out to be a model tenant and a model neighbor and friend.'

In November, Wolfe left her rental property and purchased the house on Chislett Street - where she and her sister were both found dead.

Shortly after moving in, Wolfe's house was burglarized, according to Carter, whom she asked for help fixing a broken window. Carter says she advised her to get a burglar alarm, although it's unclear whether she did.

'I 
really hope they find who did this. I can't imagine [Wolfe] hanging out with
 unsavory individuals. She's such a nice person that maybe someone got 
through,' Carter said.
