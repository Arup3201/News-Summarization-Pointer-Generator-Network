A teenage father who was trying to act as a 'peacemaker' in a late-night brawl has been left wheelchair-bound from a single punch which caused 'catastrophic' injuries.

Callum Bowling, 18, whose daughter Grace was born just six weeks earlier, needs further surgery to reconstruct his skull after the attack in Bolton town centre.

Tom Cooper, also aged 18, was jailed for 27 months after landing a solitary blow, which knocked Mr Bowling to the ground where his head hit the floor with 'very considerable impact'.

His victim was left with a catalogue 
of injuries including post-traumatic amnesia, epilepsy, poor memory and 
concentration, personality changes and behavioural problems.

Mr Bowling is no longer able to live with his fiancee because of his injuries, Bolton Crown Court heard on Monday.

Cooper, of Little Hulton, was jailed for causing grievous bodily harm.

The court heard how he hit Mr Bowling with a 'very forceful' blow on March 3 this year.

Saul Brody, prosecuting, told the court Mr Bowling, from Westhoughton, and Cooper had been in Bolton town centre with their separate groups of friends when a dispute broke out in the early hours of the morning.

Mr Bowling tried to act as a 'peacemaker' but Cooper punched him, and he fell to the ground.

He was rushed to Royal Bolton Hospital for treatment, where he was unconscious and put on a ventilator.

The young dad suffered bleeding on the brain and was transferred to Salford Royal Hospital for emergency surgery.

Mr Bowling, who used to live with his fiancee but now lives with his mother who cares for him, was discharged from hospital after two months but his condition deteriorated further, and he had issues with swallowing, balance and seizures.

The court heard his treatment is ongoing and he will need further surgery to reconstruct his skull.

Andrew McLoughlin, defending, told the court Cooper realised he would be jailed for the attack.

He added: 'He offers his sincere apologies to the family of Callum Bowling, and Callum Bowling himself, for the consequences caused and the ongoing consequences.'

Sentencing, Judge Maureen Roddy said: 'I know whatever sentence I impose is not going to restore your victim’s health. I know that whatever sentence I impose, his family are likely to think it doesn’t fit the crime, but there are rules and sentencing has to be within those rules.

'He has suffered in his physical, mental and psycho-social health. He will never be the young man he was. His mother will not have the son she had. 

'His daughter, who was only weeks old at the time, will not have the father she expected to have.

'The consequences of your act that night have been truly catastrophic for that family.'

The judge also paid tribute to Mr Bowling’s mother, Katherine.

She urged her to seek support, after being told she had received no help or compensation to help care for her son.

Outside court, Mr Bowling’s fiancee, Beth Sutton, said: 'Grace hasn’t got a dad now. He can’t even pick her up. He can’t feed her or change her nappy. He loves her to pieces and it kills him not to be a dad.'

His mother added: 'I was expecting to be quite angry but I’m numb. I don’t know how to feel.

'Callum has to take it day by day now. Before this happened, he was a very good, keen football player. He was an amazing dad.'

She said he now takes a Leeds United hat everywhere after meeting footballer El Hadji Diouf, who visited him at home and took him to a Bolton Wanderers match at the Reebok Stadium.

Mrs Bowling has also contacted the family of Adam Rogers, who launched a campaign when the 24-year-old died after a single punch as he tried to prevent a fight in Blackburn town centre.
