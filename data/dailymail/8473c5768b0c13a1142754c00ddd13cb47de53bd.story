The drunk passenger who stripped naked on the airport tarmac and challenged an airline captain to a fight has been identified as former postal worker Robert Scheer.

Mr Scheer, 52, was caught on camera as he stripped off at Manchester Airport after arriving on an easyJet flight from Malta.

He can be seen challenging the plane's captain to a fight before being slapped across the face by his female companion, believed to be partner Karen Grisdale.

Robert Scheer has been identified as the drunk passenger who took his clothes off at Manchester Airport

He also urinated on the side of the Terminal One building in front of a shocked crowd before being ‘dry Tasered’ - where the weapon is placed in direct contact with the target and activated - and arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly.

It is believed trouble began mid-flight when the traveller, who appeared drunk, became abusive and started swearing at fellow passengers.

A witness who asked not to be named said: 'He'd had an altercation with other passengers and the captain had come down the plane to calm him down.'

After coming off the plane, down the steps and on to the tarmac, he stripped to his black underpants and gestured towards the pilot.

The witness added: 'He must have been drunk because when he came off the plane, he took his top off and shouted "come on then" in a Manchester accent and was trying to get the captain to fight him.

'Then he carried on taking all his clothes off. I have no idea why. The woman he was with gave him a slap for it.'

The man put his clothes back on before entering Terminal One, where police arrived at 1.40pm.

They tried to control him but resorted to using a 'dry' Taser when he refused to co-operate. He was then arrested and escorted from the airport.

He was later ordered to pay a fixed penalty notice after the incident shortly before 1.30pm on Thursday, September 26

Mr Scheer, who formerly worked in a Royal Mail sorting office, was unavailable for comment when visited at his home.

Following the incident a police spokesman said: 'A 52-year-old man was dry tasered and arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in a public place.

'He was issued with a fixed penalty notice.'
