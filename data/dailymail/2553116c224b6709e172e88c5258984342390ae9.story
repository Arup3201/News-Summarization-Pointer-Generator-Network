A married man convicted of sexually assaulting a horse has been charged with possessing child pornography.

William Diemer, 31, was arrested on Monday after police found the sexually explicit material on his computer following a tip-off.

The Maine resident, who does not have children, was charged with 15 counts of possession of child porn and released on $5,000 unsecured bail.

The disturbing news comes after Diemer was jailed for raping a horse at the University of Maine, where he was a student, more than a decade ago.

The Maine Campus reported the then 20-year-old was caught sexually assaulting a horse in a barn at the university's Witter Farm on September 20, 2003.

He initially fled from the scene but was identified in video surveillance footage. The horse didn't need medical treatment.

A report from UMaine Public Safety read in court said the videotape showed Diemer in three different stalls over 30 minutes before he was he was discovered by farm staff.

Buckets were found upside down behind the horses.

In 2004, Diemer pleaded guilty to a cruelty to animals charge.

Witter Farm's Judy Finchum told the court Diemer should be punished under the full extent of the law.

'He should not walk among us, because he is the lowest of the low,' Finchum said.

He was sentenced to nine months in jail with all but 30 days suspended, underwent counseling and was prohibited from owning or possessing domestic animals for the rest of his life.

The university paper also reported two other horses were assaulted before the 2003 attack. Diemer denied responsibility for the assaults.

The attacker inserted a foreign object into the reproductive organs of a 20-year-old mare on August 5, 2002, and an older mare in May 2003, causing internal damage and bleeding.
