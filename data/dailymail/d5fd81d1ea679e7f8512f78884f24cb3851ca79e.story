Sergio Busquets has reassured Barcelona fans that Lionel Messi has no intentions of leaving the club.

Busquets spoke out following reports which suggested the Argentinian had fallen out with manager Luis Enrique.

The 26-year-old has no doubts Messi will be staying with the Catalan club, telling his club's official website: 'He controls his future and he has said he has no intention of leaving - and that's very important for us.

Sergio Busquets has reassured Barcelona fans that superstar Messi has no intentions of leaving the club

'All he was saying yesterday was the typical cliche that you never know what might happen in the future.

'People usually only know what they are told by the press but I think everyone has now had a chance to speak. We just want to be united, to be as one, and for the fans to be behind us.'

Busquets spoke very highly of his team-mate, describing him as a very 'down-to-earth' person - and expects the La Liga record goalscorer to see out the remainder of his career at Barcelona.

The 27-year-old has already scored 16 goals this season but missed out on the FIFA Ballon d'Or for the second successive year to fierce rival Cristiano Ronaldo on Monday night.
