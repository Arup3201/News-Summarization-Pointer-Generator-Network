Decorated war hero Ken Dawson, 89,  who is pictured wearing his treasured medals, was tricked out of his life savings by  jobless bingo caller Paul Youngs

A kind hearted war hero was tricked out of his life savings in a 'dastardly betrayal' by a jobless bingo caller he treated like an old comrade, a court heard.

Trusting veteran Ken Dawson, 89, befriended Paul Youngs even though the 53-year-old  was barred from their local social club where they both served on the committee.

The decorated former Rifleman who fought the Japanese in Burma wanted to give Youngs a second chance and helped him pay for a car, buy meals, and only asked in return for his assistance with the weekly shop.

Callous Youngs repaid the old man by using his bank card to withdraw £150 every week from his account over a four month period, which he spent on himself. 

By the time the thefts were discovered, when Mr Dawson checked his bank statements, he had lost up to £1,800 from his savings account.

Today as Youngs was jailed for 12 weeks, Mr Dawson said he had 'paid the price' for his good deed.

'I just thought everyone deserves a second chance and unfortunately I've found out the hard way that a leopard never changes its spots,' said the great grandfather from Burnley, Lancashire.

'I had put all my trust in him fought his corner and I thought he was my friend - yet he betrayed me in a most dastardly way.

'The army makes you realise and see things, you learn trust and respect - but unfortunately I put trust in this man like I would have done one of my old comrades and sadly I've paid the price. 

'I lay awake at night now and have trouble getting to sleep because I keep going through it all in my head and wonder how it happened, and why he did that to me.

'I am just pleased that he got sent down - it serves him right.'

The old man was 17 when he joined the First Battalion Cameronians Scottish Rifles and had served in India, Burma and Singapore winning five campaign medals.

As the oldest veteran at his local Royal British Legion he would lead the Remembrance parade in Burnley each year.

Burnley Magistrates Court was told the pair had met nine years ago at Rosegrove Unity Working Men's Club where Mr Dawson had been a committee member for 30 years.

Youngs, who at the time worked at a care home and lived with his late mother, joined the committee and became a caller at the club's bingo nights.

After he was barred Mr Dawson took pity on him.

The pair would go shopping together and on day trips to Blackpool. Mr Dawson would lend Youngs money and even lent him £3,000 to buy a car. 

On occasions Youngs would pay him back in full but on others, if he claimed to be struggling financially, the victim told him to leave it or forget about it.

Mr Dawson, a retired welder, added: 'Paul had been barred from the club but I wanted to stick up for him because it seems like the right the thing to do.

'Everyone makes mistakes and I even tried to get him back into the club.

'We used to go shopping every Saturday afternoon and I would give him my card to get out cash for me to cover the week.

'I had trouble getting out of the car so I'd give him my card and number to get £150 but he was getting double, £150 for me and £150 for him.

'Unfortunately when I got my bank statements I would put them in the drawer and it was only when I came to look at them that I realised what had happened and I felt sick to the stomach.

'I had more or less looked after him. I used to take him fishing every Tuesday and after we had been shopping I would take him for a meal once or twice in the week. I thought he was a friend and as a friend I always paid.

'When we first started going to the hole in the wall I could see what he was doing because he parked right against it - but then all of a sudden after a few weeks he started going round the other side of the building and he was taking longer to withdraw the money. 

'I don't think he is bothered or sorry for what he has done. In court he didn't even have the decency to look at me in the eye.

'It is a lot of money and my life savings and pensions I had worked hard for. I feel like I've been taken for granted.'

When he was quizzed by police, Youngs, of Stansfield Street, Burnley,said he had been out of work, was struggling with bills and the money was to keep him on the ' straight and narrow.' 

He admitted theft between March 29 and August 22 but claimed he only stole £1,200.

His lawyer Keith Rennison said in mitigation: 'He would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Dawson. 

'He is extremely sorry and extremely ashamed of himself, more particularly for the impact this has had upon Mr Dawson. Should the defendant get gainful employment, he will repay him in full.'

But sentencing JP Stephen Riley told Youngs: 'What you did involved a breach of trust to an extremely high degree. We want to punish you and protect the public.'

After the hearing Clifford Heaton, secretary for the Rosegrove Unity Working Men's Club, said. 'We all feel very disgusted at what Paul did to Ken especially as Ken trusted him so much.

'Needless to say Paul is barred for life - but I don't think even he would come back anyway because he would be too ashamed. We have spoken about putting a charity show on for Ken in the New Year and any proceeds to go to him and if he wants he can put the proceeds to the British Legion.

'Ken is a very proud man and this has upset him. Paul used to be a good lad at one time and used to be the Bingo caller here. These days people do not have a kind word to say about him.'
