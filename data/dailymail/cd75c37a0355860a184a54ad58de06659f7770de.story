Louis van Gaal's old coach Barry Hughes has claimed that the current Manchester United boss would have been better suited to a teaching role than one in the cut-throat world of football management. 

Welshman Hughes, who coached van Gaal at Sparta Rotterdam in the early 1980s, has admitted his surprise at seeing the Dutchman rise up the managerial ladder.

'Louis wasn't one I had marked down for a career in management... not for a minute.

'I always thought he would go back to teaching. I never believed he would stay in the game. I didn't look at him and think, "he's got something special, he could be a decent manager,"' Hughes told The Sunday People.

Despite Hughes' initial doubt at van Gaal's managerial capabilities, the former Netherlands coach has been in coaching for 28 years, the last 23 of which he has held a top European position.

Upon leaving Sparta Rotterdam in 1986, the club at which he played for the majority of his career, van Gaal had a short playing spell at AZ Alkmaar, before becoming assistant manager.

He then joined Ajax in the same role, before becoming the club's manager in 1991. From there, the Dutchman has managed his country in two separate spells, been in charge of Barcelona twice, Bayern Munich once, and now holds the top role at Manchester United.

Hughes though, maintains that it came out of the blue, and that he had never spoken to van Gaal about the possibility of coaching, despite working with him in the lead-up to the birth of his management career.

'When I managed him, I never had a discussion with him about coaching. He didn't come in and ask me about anything. Dick Advocaat...would ask questions as to why we did certain sessions - but never Louis.'

Hughes, the former Welsh international footballer who made a name for himself after discovering Ruud Gullit as a 15-year-old at Haarlem, began coaching in the Netherlands in 1966, and crossed paths with van Gaal in 1978 when he joined Sparta Rotterdam.

At the time, van Gaal was playing football semi-professionally, while juggling a side job as a PE teacher. Little did either of them know that 36 years later, he would be in charge at Old Trafford.
