Malicious: Chantelle McCluney, 23, laughed as the helpless victim was tortured in her Manchester flat

A mother-of-three lured a man to her home for a threesome, only to watch and laugh as he was  tortured by her boyfriend and another man.

Chantelle McCluney, 23, laid a honeytrap by inviting the victim to her flat in Harpurhey, Manchester, for a liaison with her boyfriend, Craig Hogan.

But when they arrived, the man was tied to a chair before being kicked, 
punched and forced to drink bleach.

They then burnt the man with an improvised flamethrower, created by spraying a can of deodorant at a cigarette lighter.

During the terrifying ordeal, he was also dunked in a
 urine-filled mop bucket, struck with a chair, robbed and forced to pose
 naked on a balcony for half-an-hour.

At one point McCluney had sex with another of her lovers, Andrew Doyle, as the humiliated man lay covered in blood on the floor – with Doyle kicking him throughout.

When detectives asked McCluney why she had sex while the helpless victim was still in the room, she said: 'I’ll admit it – I felt horny.'

Despite subjecting the man to 'inhuman' torture,  she was spared jail after admitting false imprisonment at Manchester Crown Court.

Judge Richard Mansell QC, gave her an 18-month, suspended for two years.

He concluded she had been under the influence of Hogan, after an ‘abusive’ relationship during her teens, and was in fear of Doyle.

The court heard that the victim, now 42, was so traumatised he did not speak about the ordeal for four years.

It was only when he went to counselling after a suicide attempt that he revealed the details of his horrifying experience and the group was arrested.

On the night of the attack, the victim, 
who says he has by flashbacks and ‘can still taste bleach’, was found 
wandering in the city centre in a ‘stupor’  with severe facial injuries.

At the time, he told police he had been robbed by strangers.

Weeks before the attack in October 2008, the man had been invited to a threesome with McCluney and Hogan, who he had met in jail. During that encounter, Doyle turned up at McCluney’s flat.

It emerged that McCluney and Hogan had been involved in a sex session earlier that day with him as well.

Liaison: The court heard how the mother-of-three had sex with another one of her lovers while the victim lay on the floor, covered in blood

The victim thought that Doyle ‘looked like a drug addict’, and told McCluney in a text that she should get tested for sexually transmitted diseases.

McCluney told Doyle, who was enraged, and recruited her and Hogan to get revenge.

The man, who begged for mercy, was pelted with eggs by the trio before being released with a warning from Doyle that his family would be shot if he spoke out.

Convicted robber Doyle, 24, was jailed for five years for false imprisonment, and convicted arsonist Hogan, 28, was jailed for four years. Both pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.
