Children are known for their brutal honesty and it's thanks to an innocent but tactless comment from her young son that a mother lost 13 stone.

Mother-of-two Agnieszka Roguska, 32, from Bristol, tipped the scales at 23st and was flabbergasted when her eight-year-old, Oliver, asked her why she was so fat.

It was thanks to his question that she decided to 'get a grip' and ditch her diet of crisps, chips and super-sized meals.

Oliver asked Agnieszka why her belly was so much bigger than other mothers. Until that moment, she hadn't realised how out of control her weight had got.

Now, just one year later, Agnieszka has dropped down to a healthy 10st, after following a strict diet and a regular exercise routine.

Agnieszka said: 'I remembered facing this same situation when I was a child as my mum was bigger than other mums were. 

'When I was a teenager, I remember other mums looking pretty and wearing nice clothes when my mum was hiding in the house from others with her weight problem. 

Agnieszka (left with Oliver before she lost weight, and right, together today) began to over eat when he was in Neonatal Intensive care and her diet got worse after her divorce

'At that time I promised myself that I would never be like my mum. I wanted to be that pretty mum in nice clothes that he could be proud of.'

Agnieszka's weight rose to 23st after she prematurely gave birth to Oliver just 27 weeks - more than three months early.

Little Oliver remained in a neonatal intensive care unit for months where Agnieska relied on quick snacks between visits.

Shortly after Oliver returned home, Agnieszka's marriage broke down and she began comfort eating, gorging on super-sized meals and fatty snacks.

Full-time mother Agnieska, now divorced, explained: 'Oliver's prognosis was not good and his stay in NICU took a huge emotional toll upon me.

'I did not have the time or the capacity to think or look after myself and that is when I began to put the weight on.

'When my son was aged one my relationship with his father broke down. Facing the end of my marriage was also extremely stressful and my weight continued to increase.'

But after Oliver confronted her Agnieszka lost 13st in just 12 months using the Cambridge Weight Plan.

She swapped her high fat, high calorie comfort foods and large portions for a strict diet, often using shakes, bars and soups to replace meals.

Agnieszka has now been crowned slimmer of the year by Cambridge Weight Plan after she beat off more than 2,000 competitors for the accolade and is determined to stay slim and fit.
