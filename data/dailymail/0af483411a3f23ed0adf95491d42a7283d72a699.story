An adorable lion cub got a taste of his own medicine after his father put a stop to his cheek with a giant roar.

In the incredible pictures snapped by French photography team Laurent Renaud and Dominque Haution, the cub tries to get the attention of his father by baring his teeth.

But the leader of the pride soon put his foot down as his lioness looked on by scooping his son up in his mouth with a mighty roar.

Mlle Haution, 55, said: "The baby cub wouldn't stop trying to play with his father and he was getting grumpy and telling him to stop.

"I think that the adult lion was teaching his baby to roar - it's what they do in the wild.

"The cubs weren't more than a few months old - they were adorable and hadn't developed sharp teeth."
