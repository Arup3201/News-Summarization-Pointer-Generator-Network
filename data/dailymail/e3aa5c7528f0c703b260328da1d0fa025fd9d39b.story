Florida polo millionaire John Goodman, convicted of DUI manslaughter earlier this month, has reached a settlement of $46 million with the family of the 23-year-old victim who died in the crash.

Goodman, 48, faces up to 30 years in prison after being convicted of drunk-driving manslaughter and leaving the scene of a crash that left Scott Wilson dead in February 2010.

The huge payout relates to lawsuits brought against the tycoon by the victim's parents’, Lili and William Wilson, and comes before Goodman’s sentencing on April 30.

Polo tycoon: John Goodman has reached a settlement of $46 million with Lili and William Wilson - whose son, Scott, died after Goodman crashed into his car

Justice: Lili Wilson leaves the courtroom after the guilty verdict was read out - she and her husband have reached a settlement with Goodman

The Wilson’s attorney, Christian Searcy, confirmed the 
figure to the Palm Beach Post and said that $6 million of the amount would be paid by The 
Player’s Club – the bar where Goodman was drinking before the crash.

The settlement comes after Goodman, 
the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida, 
adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins
last October, entitling her to up to a third of his biological 
children's trust fund, worth $300million.

Scott Wilson was only 23 years old when he was killed in the car crash

At the time the Wilson’s lawyers slammed the move as an attempt by Goodman to shield his assets.

The revelation of the $46 million pay
out also comes after last week’s news that Goodman’s lawyers had filed a
motion for a new trial based on alleged jury misconduct.

The motion was made after an 
alternate juror called Goodman’s lawyers claiming that it was ‘clear’ to
her that the other jurors had decided the defendant was guilty before 
the trial was over.

Prosecutors successfully claimed that
Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into 
Wilson's car two years ago, causing it to roll into a canal.

The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes.

Goodman left the scene and waited an 
hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery 
as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene.

After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit.

At trial Goodman said he was sure of 
one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the
crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to 
alleviate his pain.

After leaving a bar, he said his car 
suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my 
brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used 
to,' he said.

Unable to control the vehicle, it 
slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not 
aware he had hit another driver so left the scene.

If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed.

Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported.

'I ... drank it to alleviate, 
thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the 
reason his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving 
level when his blood was taken three hours after the crash.

Goodman’s lawyers are now hoping for a
new trial or for the conviction to be overturned after an alternate 
juror came forward saying the jury had broken pledges they made to the court.

Bill: The court is shown Goodman's receipt for drinks, allegedly bought for himself and others before the crash

The defense claims that the jurors 
ignored the court’s orders by discussing evidence before the end of the 
case, making derogatory remarks about Goodman’s wealth, and by reading 
media coverage of the case.

The motion detailed how an alternate 
juror reported the alleged misconduct to the court but when she did not 
hear back she called Goodman’s lawyers.

She told them that the jury of five 
men and one woman discussed the case among themselves ‘throughout the 
trial’ despite being told they shouldn’t.

'We all had things to say about the 
trial as it progressed each day,' the juror said in an affidavit. 'On 
one occasion I reminded the jury that we had been instructed by the 
court not to discuss the case until the end. In reply, I was teased by 
being asked by another juror if I had a crush on Mr. Goodman.'

The juror also claimed that members of the jury often mentioned Goodman’s wealth'

'Based on the negative talk about Mr.
Goodman's wealth and the issues discussed about the case, it was clear 
to me that these jurors had already made up their minds before Thursday,
March 22,' the juror stated in her affidavit.

Home sweet home: Goodman sold his mansion in Wellington, Florida to his children's trust for $3.8million and now pays $2,000 in rent each month

The motion details that one juror 
started writing a book about the case while the trial was still ongoing 
and that jurors made ‘false statements’ to cover up another’s 
‘prejudicial gesture.’

The juror who spoke to Goodman’s 
lawyers claimed that one of the jurors was keen to finish the case by 
Friday March 23 because they had a weekend boating trip planned.

Wilson was a University of Central 
Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer at the time of the 
crash. He had been driving home to Wellington to visit his family when 
Goodman ran a stop sign.
