With World Cup fever sweeping the States, celebrities have been queuing up to offer their words of wisdom for Jurgen Klinsmann and his team as they compete out in Brazil.

And ahead of the last-16 clash with Belgium on Tuesday night, former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson has given Team USA a very colourful pep talk.

Appearing on Fox Sports show 'The Buzzer', Iron Mike predicted the Americans would 'Kick Belgium's asses' in the knockout meeting in Salvador.

Patriotic: The former heavyweight boxing champion breaks into a chorus of 'USA! USA! USA!'

'Everybody thinks they're gonna walk all over us, especially the Belgians,' Tyson says. 'But that's not gonna happen, we're gonna surprise them.'

After a chorus of 'USA, USA, USA!' the former boxer gives a bizarre warning about Algerian referee Djamel Haimoudi and his team.

'You gotta be careful because the officials have been giving some bad calls, they're giving horrible calls,' he rants.

'You know they're gonna try and screw the Americans any chance they have!'

He concludes the team talk by promising the Belgians he will ram some chocolate where the sun doesn't shine, apparently whatever the result.

Concerns: Klinsmann admitted he had reservations over the appointment of Algerian official Djamel Haimoudi

The United States enter the second round game with Belgium in confident mood, having defied most people's expectations by advancing from a group containing Germany, Portugal and Ghana.

Tyson is alluding to Klinsmann's fears the appointment of French-speaking Haimoudi could do his team a disservice in the match.

Asked by a journalist at his press conference on Monday whether he had a problem that Haimoudi would be able to speak French to the Belgian players, Klinsmann remarkably claimed that he had.

'We hope it’s not a concern,' he replied. 'He did two games already and did them well. I hope he continues to referee in the perfect way he has so far.

'But is it a good feeling? No, because Algeria came from same group as Belgium and he speaks French like their players. He will be able to speak to their players and not to us.

'It is also the same country we beat in the last second at the last World Cup, but it is what it is.

'I know it’s tricky for FIFA to select the right referee for the right games.

'We respect the decision and hope that everything goes well. We will give him the benefit of the doubt.'
