Britain is set to enjoy a tropical heatwave this week which will bring the hottest day of the year so far.

But while temperatures are set to reach 28C (82F) on Wednesday, the Met Office has warned that this warmth will not come with 'wall-to-wall sunshine'.

Instead there will be thunder storms and widespread cloud, causing sticky and humid conditions.

It comes after heavy rain hit large parts of the UK over the weekend, affecting the Queen's Club tennis and the Isle of Wight Festival.

Rainy: As spectators cower underneath their umbrellas at the Queen's Club grass court championships in London yesterday, more storms are on the way along with hot temperatures this week

Bad weather: Despite the optimistic sign, festival-goers make their way through the mud at a wet and windy 2013 Isle of Wight Festival over the weekend

Meanwhile in Europe, some parts of France and Spain have seen temperatures reach 42C, and it is hot air from these countries which will make the UK so warm this week.

'This is going to be a warm week and Wednesday will easily be the hottest day of the year so far,' a Met Office spokesman said.

'The warm weather that France and Spain have been experiencing recently is being dragged over Britain.

'We believe that temperatures will be between 26C and 28C, and will feel very warm and humid.

'But it will not be wall-to-wall sunshine, it will be mainly cloudy with a chance of thunder storms.'

But by the end of the week Britain's changeable climate will take hold again, with temperatures dropping markedly.

'By the time we get to Thursday it will feel fresher and temperatures will be between 20C and 22C,' the spokesman said.

Warm: With the French Alps in the background, children enjoy the hot weather over Europe by jumping into Lake Geneva

It came as the Met Office prepares for a major summit on Britain's climate, after several years of summer floods and droughts, freezing winters and even widespread snow in May this year.

Leading meteorologists and scientists will discuss one key issue: is Britain's often terrible weather down to climate change, or just typical?

It follows the coldest spring in more than 50 years, as well as droughts and floods in 2012, the freezing winter of 2010 and incredibly widespread snow last month.

Forecast: The Met Offices say the UK will heat up this week with temperatures likely reaching 28C on Wednesday

Experts will travel to the forecaster's headquarters in Exeter on Tuesday.

Attendees are expected to debate whether the changing weather pattern in the UK, and in northern Europe, is because of climate change or simply variable weather.

'We have seen a run of unusual seasons in the UK and northern Europe, such as the cold winter of 2010, last year's wet weather and the cold spring this year,' a Met Office spokesman said.

'This may be nothing more than a run of natural variability, but there may be other factors impacting our weather.

'There is emerging research which suggests there is a link between declining Arctic sea ice and European climate - but exactly how this process might work and how important it may be among a host of other factors remains unclear.'
