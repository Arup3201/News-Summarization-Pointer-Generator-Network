A British woman is to take charge of one of the jewels in the crown of French industry as new CEO of Citroen.

Linda Jackson, 55, head of Citroen in the UK and Ireland since 2010, will take the driver's seat at the 95-year-old company from current chief Frederic Banzet on June 1.

The Warwick University graduate has more than 35 years experience in the motor industry, but is just the third woman to ever head up a major car maker.

In the driver's seat: Linda Jackson, the new chief executive of Citroen, takes over the company on June 1

Ms Jackson has presided over a 6 per 
cent rise in sales in her region in the past year alone, successfully 
moving the company away from a discounting culture and unprofitable 
fleet deals.

She told 
Autocar that she believes having her 'Anglo Saxon, British way of doing 
things will be a good thing in a diverse French company.'

Outlining
 her strategy to Auto Express, she said: 'We want to be more creative, 
affordable and offer things that really matter to mainstream customers

'We
 want to be innovative in design – we’ve been good at that in the past 
and new models like the C4 Picasso have shown that again.

'We want our cars to have useful technology like our touch screens that are easy to use and the air bumps on the C4 Cactus.'

Citroen is well known for its creativity, with its iconic but odd-looking 2CV one of the most successful cars of the 20th century and hailed for the quality of its engineering.

Ms 
Jackson is taking the the wheel at Citroen at a difficult time, with 
parent company PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe's second-biggest carmaker, 
struggling to stem losses in most of its traditional markets.

Outgoing
 chief Mr Banzet is a member of the Peugeot family, which is 
reducing its stake so the company can accept a €3billion cash injection 
from the French government and China's Dongfeng Motor Group.

France,
 Dongfeng and the Peugeot family will each hold a 14 per cent stake in 
the company, with the hope that the Chinese connection will help drive 
higher sales in the country, now the world's biggest car market.

The
 reshuffle comes just over a month after Carlos Tavares, a former 
Renault executive, took over from former Peugeot CEO Philippe Varin.

Strategy
 director Yves Bonnefont, who currently doubles as deputy head of 
Citroen, will lead the premium DS marque as it separates from Citroen 
under a recovery plan unveiled by Mr Tavares last month.

Ms Jackson and Ms Bonnefont will sit on the group's executive committee along with Peugeot brand chief Maxime Picat.
