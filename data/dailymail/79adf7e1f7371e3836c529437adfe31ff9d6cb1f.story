Lukas Podolski has paid tribute to Arsenal fans in a heartfelt Instagram post ahead of his proposed loan move to Inter Milan.

The German international arrived at Inter's training ground on Saturday, and is expected to sign for Roberto Mancini's side until the end of the season in a deal which will cost the Italians £1.5million.

And Podolski, who has emerged as a fan favourite in north London, says he can't thank Arsenal fans enough for all they have done for him and hopes to meet them again.

Podolski also caught up with new boss Mancini at the club's training ground and posed for a photo with the former Manchester City manager. 

'I can't express in words my gratitude towards Arsenal fans for all they have done for me in my years in London!' Podolski wrote. 

'Please know my heart always holds a place for you. I've loved every minute playing for Arsenal & I hope I have left my mark on the club & fans alike. 

'Hopefully we shall meet again! COYG #AFC #RedArmy #Fans #Poldi #Gunner #Thanks'

Lukas Podolski arrives in Milan where he is set to join Inter on loan until the end of the season

Podolski was the centre of attention, with Inter fans clearly delighted at his imminent arrival 

The 29-year-old wore a scarf with the club's famous black and blue colours as he signed autographs and posed for pictures at Milan's Linate Airport. 

Speaking to Sky Italia, he said: 'I spoke to Mancini and think he’s a great coach. He wanted me and I’m happy to be here. I know Serie A, it’s a very competitive League.

'I want to help the team get into the Champions League. Do I have a message for the fans? I am happy, Forza Inter and we hope to have a great season.' 

Podolski missed Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to Southampton on New Year's Day due to injury, and Arsene Wenger revealed that the club had received an improved bid from the Italian giants - he called Inter's previous offer 'farcical'. 

Podolski's move to Inter will net Arsenal £1.5million

Podolski's Arsenal days look like they could be numbered as he is set to sign a loan deal to Inter

The German  has flourished in the Champions League, scoring against Anderlecht (right) and Galatasaray

He has featured in thirteen of the Gunners' games this season but only managed to find the net three times, all of which came in the Champions League.

Podolski has flourished in Europe this season but has been given limited opportunities in the Premier League.  

Podolski would be joining up with a struggling Inter side who currently sit eleventh in Serie A and have only managed one win in the league since the beginning of November.

The 29-year-old has spent much of the season on the bench, making just 13 appearances for Arsenal 

Inter manager Roberto Mancini will be hoping Podoloski can help his side climb up the Serie A table
