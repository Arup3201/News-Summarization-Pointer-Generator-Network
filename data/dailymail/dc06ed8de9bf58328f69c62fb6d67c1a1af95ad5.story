A stranded cargo ship was busted out of ten-foot thick ice by a hulking Canadian icebreaker after a US Coast Guard ship got stuck.

The Arthur M Anderson had languished in frozen-over Lake Erie for five days on its way to Wisconsin after getting trapped by the hefty sheets of ice.

Its ten-strong crew were stuck on board - and hoped to be rescued by the US Coast Guard's Bristol Bay tugboat.

Breaking free: The Arthur M Anderson, front, was stuck in Lake Erie, and needed to be rescued by a Canadian coast guard ship, back, after a failed attempt by the U.S.

Stranded: The Arthur M Anderson, a 767ft cargo ship, was trapped in the ice on Lake Erie for five days

Savior: The Canadian coast guard's Griffon smashed through the thick ice and freed both ships

But that ship ended up getting stuck in the ice itself - at which point the Canadian coast guard was called in for help.

They dispatched the much large Griffon icebreaker, which has now rescued both ships from the ice.

The 234ft icebreaker first rescued the Bristol Bay, which would have run out of food had a Coast Guard helicopter not made an emergency delivery.

Worth a try: The U.S. coast guard dispatched the Bristol Bay to rescue the Anderson - but it got stuck too

The real deal: Canada's coast guard then sent out the Griffon, a much larger icebreaker, which rescued both ships

After helping the beleaguered rescue boat, which sailed home to Cleveland, the Griffon turned back for the Anderson, Cleveland.com reported.

It managed to smash a space around the ship then carve out a path for the Anderson to make it to Detroit.

Coast guard ships reported that the ice on the lake was often six feet thick, with some parts up to ten feet thick.

Because of strong winds over the lake, ice flows are broken apart then freeze back together on top of each other in 'wind rows', which are even thicker than regular ice.
