Jamie Redknapp has stated he finds it impossible how Liverpool can win the Premier League title this term following their third defeat in four top flight games.

The Reds crashed to a 3-1 loss at West Ham to follow up defeats by Aston Villa and Manchester City earlier in the season, which leave them six points behind league leaders Chelsea having played a game more.

The former Liverpool midfielder voiced concerns over the impact of selling Luis Suarez over the summer and the time it will take for Brendan Rodgers' summer signings  to settle.

'I don't put Liverpool in the equation to win the title,' Redknapp told Sky Sports.

'After selling one of the best players in the world, the best in the Premier League last season, it makes it impossible.'

'Now when you bring players in, it does take a little bit of time for them to bed in and settle. I want to see more from [Lazar] Markovic and [Adam] Lallana who are going to take time.'

'Top four should be the aim this year, the title no chance - not when you don't have Suarez in your team - he made such a difference.'

Redknapp also voiced concern over a Liverpool defence which has already conceded eight goals in five games this season, claiming summer signing Dejan Lovren is struggling to match his Southampton form in a team desperately in need of more leadership.

'Dejan Lovren was a really good signing, but he's struggling to find his way in the Premier League for Liverpool. The pressure is on and they have to adjust. The team needs more leaders and the top four is where they are.' 

Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher also criticised the Merseyside's club's defending, stating Rodgers' team have regressed.

Carragher tweeted: 'After losing Suarez Lfc were never going to score 100 goals + this season so had to be better defensively, they actually look worse now.'
