Faith healers, psychiatrists, psychologists: England have tried them at various times. But maybe there is one ingredient missing from this year’s World Cup preparations.

Rickie Lambert, the newly signed Liverpool striker, might suggest Southampton’s pre-season routine of walking over hot coals as a means to inspire the team.

For Lambert credits Southampton’s pre-season training camp, during which manager Mauricio Pochettino persuaded him to walk across the hot coals, as the reason for the extraordinary season that has seen him make his England debut and earn his £4million move to Liverpool.

‘Mauricio got some fella in to try and give you that winning mentality,’ said Lambert. ‘It was very interesting. One of his methods was to walk across burning coal bare footed.  It was a challenge, mind over matter. You knew nothing worse could happen to you during the season.’

It clearly did Southampton no harm, as it propelled them to eighth in the table. But Lambert does believe that the amount of conditioning and training undergone during pre-season under Pochettino is responsible for the presence of three Southampton players in this England squad, with Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw also included

‘That was the easy part walking on hot coals,’ said Lambert, 32, who spent most of his career in the lower leagues but who now can hope to play in the World Cup finals. ‘That was a relaxing afternoon. Mauricio took us away for 18 days to do all the conditioning work.

‘The pre-season he gave us was horrendous to do, but it benefitted us all, especially Adam. It gave him an extra yard of pace, an extra bit of strength., He's always had the skill, he's always had the vision. He's always had everything but (this season) he was able to shrug people off and he was able to run past people.

‘I am not saying he was slow last year or anything like that, but that's what I've noticed the most.  He's always been able to do everything else, but the fitness and the sharpness that the gaffer put into him is what I think has pushed him onto the next level.’

Pochettino, as an Argentine, might be an unlikely England hero; then again, he was the man who tripped Michael Owen in 2002 to give away the penalty which David Beckham converted for when England to beat Argentina. Pochettino it is who has helped turn Lambert, whose career had taken in Blackpool, Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers, into an international player.

‘I had never really been taught how to play as a lone striker,’ said Lambert. ‘I never really got taught to be a striker in the first place and then I never got taught how to be a lone striker. But he taught me. The thing that I was doing wrong most was the fact I thought I had to show for everyone on the pitch.

‘Whoever had the ball, I felt I had to run over and show for the ball, get on the ball. He was saying: “Take your time to wait until the right people have got onto the ball, like Adam and others further up the pitch.”

That's when you become effective and when you can make your movement, get on the ball and just channel all my efforts into the right places. After that, I had an understanding of how to play that position a lot better.’

Lambert, of course, was rejected by Liverpool as a teenager but now will be returning to his home-town club after the World Cup, which means he can finally be open about that tattoo on his right shoulder.

‘It’s a Liverpool tattoo and I got it after the 2005 Champions League victory. I was at Rochdale at the time. I didn’t go to the final but I managed to go to every home game in the Champions League. It was amazing. The semi-final against Chelsea was the best atmosphere I have witnessed in my life.’

Up until now, he has been coy about it, even hiding it from the likes of his England and Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard. ‘I don’t want to come across as a mad fan!’ said Lambert.

‘I’ve had to play it cool but the more I got involved with England, I did ask them (the Liverpool players) more questions about the manager and about how the club is run.

‘They have had nothing but good words to say, especially about Brendan Rodgers.  But that was before I knew there was any interest. I was a Liverpool fan just wanting to know how things were doing there.’
