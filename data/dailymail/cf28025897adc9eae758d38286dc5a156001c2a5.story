A woman who died after being overcome by fumes as she slept in her car between her four jobs had been desperately saving money to support a former boyfriend she met online and his three children.

The body of 32-year-old Maria Fernandes was found in her car in Elizabeth, New Jersey in August, after she became overcome by a deadly mixture of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gasoline container.

She worked four jobs, including two shifts at separate Dunkin Donuts and she apparently left her car running while she tried to rest while going between her jobs.

Now it has emerged that in 2012, Miss Fernandes met former boyfriend, Richard Culhane online and persuaded him to move from New York to Newark after he lost his job in construction.

Mr Culhane says she found him an apartment and paid his first month's rent before the pair moved in together.

And when they did begin to live together she would pick up the $600 a month rent, nearly double the price of her previous accommodation.

Mr Culhane adds that she then bought a tent and explained that it was for a homeless man she saw near work. She even bought suits for him and his three sons from a previous marriage when Mr Culhane's mother died for the funeral.

It has now emerged that Miss Fernandes was paying the rent for her ex-boyfriend Richard Culhane after meeting him online 

In 2011, the couple's landlord filed eviction papers when Miss Fernandes fell behind with the rent, although she was able to work out a restitution plan.

He said a state youth protection worker told him that if he wanted custody he needed a bigger apartment.

He and Miss Fernandes then found a three-bedroom for $1,100 a month and she took on a second job — supplementing pay from a bakery with earnings at a Dunkin' Donuts — to cover bills, he said.

When she quit the bakery, she picked up hours at a second Dunkin' Donuts and then a third. Co-workers said all her jobs paid at or just above the minimum wage — which New Jersey raised by $1 earlier this year to $8.25 an hour.

'I told her over and over, 'Quit one. You're working too much,' Mr Culhane said. 'But she said, 'No, I'm used to it now.''

The couple eventually split up in 2013 but even then she continued to buy toys for the children and often stopped by with video games for them.   

'Before she left, she was paying almost all of it,' Mr Culhane said of the couple's bills.

'She was like, 'I'll take care of you,' he said.

Earlier this year, Miss Fernandes entered a new relationship after creating a profile on a dating website, Gothscene.com calling herself 'Clueless.'

Her self-description as an animal lover interested in the supernatural and nostalgic for the 1980s caught the eye of Glen Carter, a 33-year-old Army veteran working at a Pennsylvania company that builds animal rescue vehicles.

'We were on the phone constantly from day one,' Mr Carter said. 'I wasn't expecting, you know, to have any serious relationship with her. It's just I was talking to her and the more I talked, the more we connected.'

As the summer began, they agreed to be a couple. Mr Carter, in the process of a divorce and having trouble making alimony payments, said he encouraged Miss Fernandes to visit and consider moving to Pennsylvania.

But the idea was cemented when Miss Fernandes took three days off from work in early August and they met for the first time, taking Mr Carter's daughter Hannah to Hersheypark.

However, after returning to Newark, she continued to keep up her busy working life.  

But three weeks after the trip, and after finishing work, Miss Fernandes tilted back the driver's seat, leaving the engine running, the windows up and the doors locked, to catch up on much-needed sleep but she never woke up.

She was found with the windows and the doors to the vehicle shut, and when emergency workers burst in they reported a chemical odor.

Hazmat was called to the scene upon determining Fernandes was dead.

The Star-Ledger notes that Miss Fernandes was only one of tens of thousands of New Jersey workers employed at multiple jobs.

'These are folks who would like to work full-time but they can't find jobs,' Carl Van Horn, director of John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, told reporters.

'They wind up in these circumstances in which they are exhausted. More commonly it creates just an enormous amount of stress.'

At least 7.5 million people nationwide are working multiple jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

For those who lost their jobs in the recession of 2008, many now working multiple positions still make less than their full-time wages and with little or no benefits.

'The average person who lost their job took a 10 per cent pay cut, (after returning to the workforce),' Van Horn said.
