The mother of a toddler who suffered a 
brain injury and burns cried in court on Thursday as a Massachusetts court was shown 
videos of her son cowering and being yelled at.

The footage was taken in November 2012 just before Jessica Linscott and her boyfriend Roland Dow left her son at a hospital and fled to Florida.

The 25-year-old, who is already in prison for child endangerment charges and witness tampering, testified against Dow who is on trial for allegedly beating and burning her son.

Emotional: Jessica Linscott cried in court on Thursday as she testified that Roland Dow struck her son in the head when he had a seizure

Trial: Roland Dow, pictured in court Thursday, is accused of severely beating and burning his girlfriend's son

She told the court she witnessed Dow strike her son in the head when he had seizures, and admitted that she didn't comfort her son.

Linscott claimed in court that Dow physically and mentally abused her, and treated her son 'worse than a dog you don't want'.

'I allowed
 a lot of things to happen that I shouldn't have let happen. I was being
 a horrific parent,' she said.

'I was neglecting my son's needs. I was 
putting Roland first and letting him take control of every situation.'

The mother claimed her boyfriend hated her child, and punished him at the slightest provocation.

If her son soiled his clothes, Dow would make him go in the shower to rinse off, 
holding him down and spraying him with water. Sometimes, the frantic 
toddler fell in the tub and got hurt as he struggled, she said.

'No
 matter what my son was doing, he was doing it wrong [in Dow's eyes],' she said. 'My son
 couldn't color the right way, he couldn't eat the right way, he 
couldn't talk the right way.'

Threat: Linscott, who is serving a sentence for child endangerment, says her boyfriend had physically abused her and her child

Abuse: The three-year-old boy was treated in hospital for burns and a brain injury

On the run: Dow and Linscott were arrested at a Florida theme park two weeks after leaving Linscott's son at a hospital and fleeing

Linscott said she let Dow abuse and terrify James in part because she feared he would do something even worse if she left him.

Linscott, who is serving a two and a half to seven-year prison sentence, told the court she had filmed her son so she could show doctors his behavior.

She claimed she believed he was having 'autistic fits' on purpose, and worried there was something seriously wrong with him.

In one video, which was filmed just a few days before her son was taken to hospital, he is seen stumbling and complaining that he had a 'tummy ache'.

Later, he was seen in the video cowering in a bathtub while being yelled at to stop having seizures.

In other videos, the three-year-old appeared stiff and unresponsive as he was sat on the toilet, or put in the bathtub.

Coached: In one video, not pictured, the child was filmed as Dow taught him what to say to social workers

Witness: Linscott testified against her boyfriend Dow, who is facing charges of assaulting her son

Arrest: The couple were arrested and charged over the alleged abuse suffered by Linscott's young son

The jury was also shown a video of the couple preparing James for a social worker's
 visit in 2012.

The video, which Linscott said Dow shot from 
under a couch, doesn't clearly show the couple or the boy, but their 
voices could be heard.

Dow
 is heard asking James, 'Do you like being here?', 'Anybody ever spank 
you?', and 'Ever go in the shower when you're really bad?'.

The little boy can be heard answering softly, 'yeah,' 'no' and 'no.'

When he was asked: 'If someone said I hit you, are they lying?' Dow answered himself with a stern 'Yes'.

Dow then could be heard saying to the boy: 'Hey, give me a hug. We're best friends, right?'

The
 couple fled to Florida after leaving the toddler at a hospital in 
November 2012. They were arrested at a theme park two weeks later.

During their absence, Linscott's son had been treated for a brain injury and burns on his wrist and fingers.

The boy was 'beaten to the point where 
he almost lost his life,' according to Massachusetts Live, which saw a court motion filed by 
Rockingham County Assistant District Attorney Patricia Conway.

The
 child, who is now five years old, is now being cared for by Linscott's 
mother. His father had died of a drug overdose before the alleged abuse 
began.

Denial: Dow, pictured at his arraignment in 2012, has pleaded not guilty to the abuse charges

Tears: Linscott wiped her eyes after breaking down during her arraignment in 2012

Dow's 
defense attorneys claimed in court that Linscott has a history of falsely accusing others 
when she felt threatened.

She testified that she lied to doctors and 
police before fleeing to Florida, but told the truth when a detective 
questioned her about the black eye Dow gave her while they were on the 
run.

Linscott
 said she was afraid to take her son and leave Dow because he had hit 
her, ripped out her hair, repeatedly choked her and once threw her down 
the stairs.

Although she did leave for three days when he threatened to 
slit her throat, she said she returned after he said he would kill 
himself.

Dow has denied all charges being brought against him.
