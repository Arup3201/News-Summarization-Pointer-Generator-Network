She loves to shock but even hardcore Miley Cyrus fans may have thought her performance at the MTV VMAs was too much.

The 20-year-old singer was joined by singer Robin Thicke on stage for a rendition of his hit single Blurred Lines and wasted no time stripping down to a tiny gold bikini.

Miley then proceeded to shake her pert derrière in the 36-year-old star’s face and draped herself all over him during the family friendly show.

Intimate: Miley thrusted her crotch in the audiences' faces

Even upon arrival the Barclays 
Center in Brooklyn, Miley made sure all eyes were on her as she danced 
her way down the red carpet in front of screaming fans.

While she’s famous for her twerking skills, the Can’t Be Tamed singer decided to try out some new moves for her audience. 

If Miley’s dancing wasn’t guaranteed
 to get the attention of the crowd, her outfit certainly did, as she 
stepped out in a bejewelled, vintage Dolce & Gabbana ensemble 
consisting of a crop top, which showed off her washboard abs, and 
matching pants.

 blonde hair was pulled back in her new favourite style, two mini buns,

spirits, as it was revealed before her red carpet appearance that she is
 to collaborate with Robin Thicke to Blurred Lines at the show.

‘They're
 friends and she loves the song. It's amazing. She comes out of a giant 
bear wearing a very provocative outfit,’ an excited pal told Us Weekly.

Miley
 and Robin both took to Twitter earlier in the day to tweet about the 
show but didn’t give any hint about their performances. 

Miley wrote ‘Today's already the f***ing
 best day ever! Just wait till VMAs tonight’ while 36-year-old Robin 
added ‘Who's ready for my performance at the @MTV #VMA's tonight? 
#VoteThicke.’

An image of the Smith family's priceless face during Miley's jaw-dropping performance became an instant internet sensation, but it turns out the reaction was actually captured during Lady Gaga's act. 'They were watching Lady Gaga's show-opening performance of Applause,' MTV clarified on Monday. 

Miley showed she has no
intention of curbing her raunchy image and in fact the only thing she shed was
her clothes as she stripped down to a bikini to perform Blurred Lines with
Robin after first singing her own hit We Can’t Stop.

While celebrities
including Ellie Goulding sang along at the Barclays Center, others weren’t so
kind with both Jaime King and Brooklyn Decker taking to Twitter to slam the
young starlet. 

Neither actress was
impressed with Miley’s performance, which included her shaking her butt in
Robin’s face and rubbing up against him, and both made veiled but catty
comments on the social networking site.

Brooklyn wrote, ‘I’m so
uncomfortable’, while Jamie added ‘A certain mortification swells over me when I
watch certain performers.’

English singer/actress Minnie Driver tweeted: '@vma Miley Cyrus needs an early night.'

Miley looked like she was having the time of her life and certainly grabbed attention in her bejewelled two piece which showed off her toned stomach

Miley recently addressed all the 
attention she's been receiving for her provocative style and love of 
twerking, noting that it's just a natural part of her growth.

'It's
 called puberty,' Miley said. 'Everyone's done it from the beginning of 
time. I'm just doing it, so you're zooming in on it and you're 
fascinated by it.'

What the...? Rihanna, Niall Horan and Harry Styles looked uncomfortable during the performance

The singer also revealed the reason 
behind her newfound love of pigtails, when in an interview with pal 
Kelly Osbourne on E!'s Fashion Police, Miley admitted that she sick of 
her short hair and is making an effort to grow it.

'I’m
 secretly tugging on it every night and taking [hair-growth vitamin 
supplement] Viviscal, I’m not going to lie,. But I’m going to rock it 
while I have it.'
