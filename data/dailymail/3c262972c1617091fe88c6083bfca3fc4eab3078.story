It’s the sort of thing that an artist may end up spending weeks or even months trying to perfect.

But this is the astonishing real-life ‘grease imprint’ of a pigeon which crashed into a kitchen window.

The image, spotted by Stuart Milligan, clearly shows the outline of its head, body and wings.

Mr Milligan was pictured looking at the imprint last Friday at his home in Dunblane, Stirling.

In July 2011 an owl apparently 
crashed into a window in Kendal, Cumbria, with experts saying the 
imprint it left behind was from the bird's 'powder down' - a substance 
which protects growing feathers.

And later that year in October 2011 
the imprint of a wood pigeon swooping was pictured after it crashed into
a home in Kingsclere, Berkshire.

Birds of all species have difficulty distinguishing between a pane of transparent glass and space or a passageway.

Some see the reflection of trees and the sky, not realising it is glass, which will reflect the most when it is darker inside than it is outside.

During mating periods male birds also become more territorial and are tricked into attacking their reflection, thinking it is an intruder in their space.
