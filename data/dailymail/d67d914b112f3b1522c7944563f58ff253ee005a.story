French bureaucrats gathering information for the national census may need to go back to history class after they sent a letter to Napoleon.

Official census body Insee addressed a letter to the late French emperor – and were told to forward their request to Saint Peter.

Insee is now facing questions about the accuracy of their work as Napoleon has been dead for nearly 200 years.

Dear Emperor: The official statistics body in France sent a letter to Napoleon Bonaparte, who died nearly 200 years ago in 1821, for the annual census

The letter caught the attention of a post office worker in Napoleon’s old hometown of Ajaccio on Corsica,’ Connexion reports.

The envelope was addressed to ‘Napoleon Bonaparte, 3 rue Saint-Charles, Ajaccio,’ and had been returned with a note reading ‘Died in 1821 - please forward to Saint Peter’.

The Corsican post office returned the letter to Insee, France’s national statistics body, with a sticker saying ‘Not known at this address’.

Napoleon Bonaparte, who was recently named the second most significant person in human history by American scientists, was born on the French Mediterranean island in 1769.

'No longer at this address': The letter was sent to Napoleon's home town Ajaccio on Corsica, and returned with a note to forward the request to Saint Peter

After rising in the ranks of the French Army, he became the Emperor Napoleon I in 1804.

He is most famous for his success as a military leader during the Napoleonic wars.

After his luck turned during a disastrous attempt to invade Russia in 1812 he was first to the island of Elba, before he returned to power only to be defeated at Waterloo in 1815.

He spent the last six years of his life imprisoned on the British island of Saint Helena where he died in 1821.
