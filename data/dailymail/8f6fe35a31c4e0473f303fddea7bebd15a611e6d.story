Britain's oldest newsagent is still working aged 96 - and was still doing his paper round until he was 88.

Charlie Reynolds, who started delivering papers 64 years ago, still gets up at 6am every day to cycle to his family shop in Swindon, Wiltshire.

The business, Reynolds Newsagent, is now run by his son Charlie jnr, 64, who opens up at 4.45am every day and works a staggering 76 hour week.

Britain's oldest newsagent: Charlie Reynolds, 96, still gets up at 6am every morning to work with his son in the newsagents in Swindon, Wiltshire

But Charlie snr still mans the counter every day during the busy morning rush. The pair are both due to retire together next year when Charlie jnr finally steps down after 50 years working for the business.

Charlie snr said: 'It keeps me active and I'm on first-name terms with most of the customers, so it's a social thing as well.

'I'm very lucky that I've kept my faculties and I still like to get around on the bike to get some exercise.

'I did retire in the 1980s but the workload was a lot for my son, so I offered to help and I'm still here now.'

Charlie snr was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1922 and worked as an apprentice boilerman before becoming a shipbuilder in Cowes during World War Two.

He married wife Phyllis in 1938 they returned to Swindon after the war in 1948 to follow in the footsteps of Charlie's sister Sue, who already ran a successful newsagents in the town.

Family store: The shop, near the Honda factory in Swindon, opened in 1962. Before that Charlie Snr had run a newsagents from his home

When it opened: The Newsagent and general store Charlie opened in the 1960s. he bought the property for less than £1,000

Charlie snr started a newspaper delivering 'round' which he ran from home until 1962 when he bought a shop in Ermin Street for less than £1,000.

He named it Reynolds Newsagent and originally ran a team of up to 15 paperboys each delivering up to 50 papers each.

Back then newspapers cost just one 1p each and the business made 1p profit per week on each property they delivered to.

Charlie snr and Phyllis, now 93, built the business into an Open All Hours-style local store.

He said: 'It was a very lucrative business in those days. I remember my sister and her husband being the first people I knew to have a motor car.

Community store: Charlie Reynolds opened the shop in 1961 and had his son - now 64 - working with him from the age of 15. Charlie Snr 'retired' in the 1980s after handing the management over to his son in 1979

Early days: A delivery form from October 1948 when Charlie began running his newspaper delivery service from his home in Swindon, Wiltshire

Delivery: A newsagents order form of all the magazines needed in one week in 1948 in the early days of the business

'We gradually built the business up and when the Honda factory opened up nearby it gave us a steady stream of customers every day.

'But it's very hard work. When we worked full time we were up long before 6am and worked in the shop until after 6pm every night.'

End-of-terrace shop: The store in Ermin Street, Stratton, opened its doors more than 50 years ago -when a loaf of bread cost the equivalent of just 5p and people smoked Woodbines

Receipt: A note from 1960 detailing purchases made by Charlie Reynolds from wholesalers for his store. The top entry reads '1000 Woodbines- £7.6'3'

Charlie jnr, an only child, was keen to join the business and started his first paper round aged 10.

He
left Kingsdown School in Swindon aged 15 in 1962 and started working 
for his father full-time shortly after he bought the Ermin Street shop.

Charlie jnr took over the business from his father in 1979 and has risen at 4am ever since to open the doors at 4.45am.

After getting up at 6am, Charlie snr cycles a few hundred yards from his home to the shop to start by 7am.

He serves on the counter during the busy morning rush before returning home by 10am to look after Phyllis, who now requires constant care due to her failing health.

Charlie jnr has had just one holiday in the last 50 years and works seven days a week.

His retirement will mark the end of the family business as his two grown-up children both have careers in other industries.

He said: 'It's very hard work, I don't know if anyone will want to take on the business - it is such a commitment.

'I've had the odd day off here and there and the occasional long weekend, but I've never had a proper holiday in 50 years.

'But we must be one of the oldest newsagents in Swindon and we really enjoy what we do.

'The shop has become a heart of the community, especially in the mornings when we always have a group of people standing outside the shop catching up on all the gossip.'
