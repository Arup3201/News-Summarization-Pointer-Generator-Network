A child with severe cerebral palsy has learned to sit up unsupported, to walk with a frame and to crawl unaided after joining a special school where his brain is ‘retrained’.

Sonny Pikett, seven, had problems eating and could not control his head, roll over or sit up until he became a student at PACE in Buckinghamshire.

The charity, which offers specialised education for children with motor disorders, helps to ‘retrain’ the brains of children like Sonny so as to bypass the damaged areas and teach others parts to substitute for them.

Sonny Pikett, seven, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was just a few weeks old

Sonny’s mother, Louise Taylor, 38, from Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, said: ‘It really works and Sonny has come on so much.

‘For me personally, it is remarkable. He’s so much more active and he enjoys social interaction whereas before he was almost scared.

‘He is now much happier and he enjoys going to school.’

Sonny was born two months early, at just 30 weeks gestation, and when he was born he was unresponsive.

He had to be delivered using forceps after Miss Taylor unexpectedly went into premature labour.

When he was delivered he was not breathing properly – he was in respiratory distress.

Until he was three, Sonny was unable to sit up unaided, crawl, walk or hold up his own head

As a result, he was rushed to the hospital’s special care baby unit and was put on a respirator.

It is still not known why he was born so early but he had to spend seven and a half weeks in hospital before he was able to go home.

Miss Taylor said: ‘We are very lucky to have him – he is a wonderful lad.’

She added: ‘We knew from a very early age that he would be disabled – we were told when he was seven weeks old that he had brain damage and would probably have cerebral palsy.’

Cerebral palsy is a general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.

These conditions are caused by a problem in the part of the brain responsible for controlling muscles.

The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or if it is damaged before, during or shortly after birth.

Causes of cerebral palsy include an infection caught by the mother during pregnancy, a difficult or premature birth, bleeding in the brain and gene mutations.

It is thought that in the UK about one in every 400 people is affected.

Symptoms include muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, uncontrolled body movements and balance and co-ordination problems.

Symptoms vary in severity from one person to another - some only have minor problems while others are severely disabled.

Some patients also have seizures, swallowing problems, difficulties with communications and learning difficulties.

There is no cure but patients can benefit from physiotherapy and occupational therapy.

Sonny failed to meet any of his developmental milestones and had problems eating and drinking, had a squint, was unable to control his head and could not walk, talk or sit up.

He was also hypersensitive to touch and to loud noises meaning he became distressed if he was exposed to loud sounds and when he touched something unexpectedly.

When he was three years old, Sonny started attending PACE in Aylesbury after Miss Taylor was told about it by a health visitor and it was recommended by another parent.

The charity provides an innovative education for children with motor disorders, such as cerebral palsy.

The centre provides a rounded education for children while making the most of the plasticity of children's brains.

It attempts to 'retrain' children's brains while they are still very malleable so that some of the undamaged parts learn to take over the function of some of the damaged parts.

It does this through repetition - encouraging children to carry out the same movements again and again until they are able to do them.

The centre also offers physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help with the children's development.

Miss Taylor said: ‘Within five minutes of going to PACE we were hooked.

‘Straight away we knew it was the right place for Sonny. We knew we wanted him to be there because of the positivity – At PACE they immediately offered to try and help Sonny and we liked that about it.’

She added: ‘Sonny is probably not going to be able to live a totally independent life, but we feel much more positive about the future.  

‘When he was first born we were given details of a bleak and uncertain future but he is now highly motivated and has made massive achievements since he started to attend PACE and we feel this will continue as he gets older.’

Sonny attends the centre full-time and has come on in leaps and bounds.

Miss Taylor told MailOnline: ‘He has become so strong by doing the activities daily.

When he was three, Sonny started attending a special school called PACE. Here specialists have worked on 'retraining' his brain so that the parts that are undamaged take on some of the function of the damaged parts

‘It has improved him so much and I believe it will continue to do so.’

She went on to explain that he is still unable to talk but that he can communicate by using a picture and word book.

She said he used to get frustrated when people couldn’t understand him but that he is now much happier and that he is also able to move around on his own by crawling or using a walking frame.

She explained that he also no longer becomes distressed by loud noises and that he can sit up and hold his head up independently.

He also now has much greater use of his hands which used to be clenched.

Miss Taylor said: ‘Every child with cerebral palsy has the right to this sort of intervention.

Sonny is now able to sit up unaided, to hold his head up, to crawl and to walk with a frame

‘I don’t know where we’d have been if Sonny hadn’t gone to PACE – thanks to the school he will now be able to lead as independent a life as is possible for him.’

She added: ‘PACE has helped us to understand cerebral palsy – now I understand why he used to react in certain ways.

‘There has been such a transformation – people always notice the huge changes in him when they haven’t seen him for a while.

‘They really have made a huge difference to him.’

Miss Taylor does not believe that Sonny will ever be able to live independently but she is confident that he will continue to improve at PACE.

She said: ‘I believe that he may well be able to speak and to become physically stronger.

Sonny's mother, Louise Taylor, says that the change in Sonny has been amazing since he started at the school

‘I don’t think he will ever live independently but I do hope he will have some degree of independence.’

Miss Taylor is now supporting a new campaign and parliamentary inquiry focused on getting a better deal for children with cerebral palsy across the whole country.

The campaign is being organised by Action Cerebral Palsy which is a consortium of charities working with children with cerebral palsy, including PACE.

One of the primary objectives of the campaign is to call for more consistent access to early and intensive support - such as that offered by PACE and which Sonny is lucky enough to have access to.

Sonny's parents do not believe that he will ever be able to live independently but they hope he will continue to improve while he is at PACE

Amanda Richardson, Chair of Action Cerebral Palsy said: 'We see every day the amazing progress that children with cerebral palsy can make, given the right support.

‘But we are fully aware that only a small proportion of the 1,800 children born with cerebral palsy every year receive the early and intensive intervention that can transform their lives.  

‘By joining forces, we aim to get a better deal for all children with cerebral palsy.'

The campaign is also fighting for the earliest possible diagnosis for people with cerebral palsy and better training for professionals working with children with the condition.
