The Spanish housing market really has hit rock bottom if this property is anything to go by.

A five-bedroom cave, built into the rocks of a hillside in Andalusia, is on the market for less than the price of a family car.

The unusual property, which includes a 700m-square plot of land large enough to build a swimming pool, has stunning mountain views.

Bring out your inner Fred Flintstone: This cave in Spain is yours for £11,000

Renovation required: The insides of the cave need a bit of love

The ‘Cave House’ - as it is being billed by sellers - is built into the rocks of Cuervas Del Campo near Granda – a popular holiday and retirement area in Spain.

It'll cost you 14,500 euros or £11,587 if you want to live like Fred Flintstone – a bargain compared  to the average price for a family home in Britain of £250,000.

The cave, being sold by Girasol Homes, is featured on property website Rightmove.com.

The blurb says the property needs renovation but enjoys ‘excellent views, good access’ and is ‘south facing.’ It also has its own private drive.

Despite not having any windows inside, the property enjoys plenty of light through the currently exposed entrances.

Hotspot: The cave is in an area of Spain renowned for its warm climate

A spokesman for Girasol Homes said yesterday: ‘This cave is located in the hamlet of Majaviejas, outside Cuevas del Campo, five minutes from town and naturist beach at lake Negratin.

‘Facing south and excellent views, there's a large plot of flat land in the front with plenty of room for a pool.

‘It has five bedrooms, but scope to enlarge. Water is connected at the entrance of the cave, and the electricity is 150 metres away.

‘Access to the cave is through a private road belonging to the cave.’

Handy: The cave is just an hour and a half from the popular south-east coast of Spain

Cuevas del Campo is one of the six picturesque villages that make up the area of Baza in the Altiplano region. It covers 60 miles and has a population of approximately 2,500.

The house is just a few miles from the picturesque Negratín Reservoir, which has its own beaches and water sports.

It is also just an hour and a half drive to the popular south-east coast of Spain.

Andalusia is the second most popular area for those looking to retire or move out to the country, after Valencia.

It is favoured for its lack of crime and all-year-around warm climate.

According to data collected by Spain’s National Institute of Statistics in 2011, there were 63,472 British people in Andalusia province.
