John Mayor was made aware of an alleged plot by Muslim extremists to infiltrate a number of schools in the Birmingham area, reports today suggest

Fears over an alleged extremist plot to infiltrate a number of Birmingham schools were raised to then Prime Minister John Major 20 years ago, reports suggest.

The leaders of three schools in Birmingham, West Midlands, are said to have written to education ministers and Mr Major over their concerns regarding extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir in the 1990s.

John Ray, a former governor at Golden Hillock School, even had a Westminster meeting with the education minister Emily Blatch, it is claimed.

Mr Ray today told Sky News: '(The Trojan Horse plot) reveals something, something that is true.

'It reveals a mess that the city council has not been able to check - the development of this whole infiltration of this ceding in of governors of one particular ideology.

'They are not people who have the welfare of these children at heart.'

Mr Ray resigned from his role at the school after 25 years in 2013 when it was taken over by the Park View Educational Trust - which is headed by Tahir Alam.

Mr Alam is accused of attempting to convert secular, state-funded schools to Islam.

However, Mr Rays's claims have been questioned by other senior members of staff at the school

Mohammed
 Shafique, another former governor, said: 'John Ray never expressed any 
concerns, never asked "why have you joined the governing body?"

'I'm
 quite concerned that he can actually say there was a mass movement to 
go into governing bodies. I certainly haven't experienced it at Golden 
Hillock School, or another school I was governor at.'

A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'There is absolutely no place for extremism in schools.

'Since 2010 we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our capability to deal with extremism in schools, including setting up a dedicated counter extremism unit within the Department for Education.

'We have also worked with Ofsted to strengthen inspectors' capacity to identify and report on extremism in schools.

'Ofsted has inspected a number of schools in the light of recent allegations and will report to the Secretary of State shortly. Retired senior police officer Peter Clarke has been asked by the Secretary of State to make a full enquiry into Birmingham schools and will report back this summer.'

The claims come as three schools inspected over the alleged Trojan Horse plot by hard-line Muslims have been given a clean bill of health by Ofsted.

Ninestiles School, an Academy in Acocks Green, Small Heath School, and Washwood Heath Academy, were all given good or outstanding ratings by the education watchdog.

The schools then published their results letters today - which concluded children-safeguarding standards were being met by the all of the institutions.

John Ray, a former governor at Golden Hillock School, claims he and officials from two other schools wrote to education ministers in the 90s raising their concerns over extremist group Hizbut-Tahrir

The schools are the first to publish the results of their inspections after the Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations.

In all, 21 schools have been inspected after the so-called letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.

Meanwhile today, Park View Educational Trust (PVET) which has been the focus of the most damning allegations, issued a statement criticising 'leaks' of other unpublished Ofsteds being reported in the media, stating it was causing 'unwarranted and unnecessary concern' for children and parents.

For its part, Park View, which runs three other city schools, has denied any wrong-doing, with trust chairman Tahir Alam calling the allegations 'a witch-hunt'.

Whatever the truth of the original letter, alleging the existence of a five-point plan to seize control of school governing boards by seeding them with hard-line Muslim governors, the fall-out caused Mr Gove in April to appoint as education commissioner Peter Clarke, the former head of the Met’s counter-terror unit.

A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is now expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned.

The Labour MP for Hodge Hill Liam Byrne, where many of the schools being probed are located, said the volume of leaks from those reports meant the entire investigation risked a descent into 'complete shambles', calling on the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted to publish their findings immediately.

Inspectors wrote to the three schools which today published their results on May 12.

At Ninestiles School in Acocks Green inspectors sent in by Mr Gove found children safeguarding requirements were being met, praising leadership and governance under executive principal Christine Quinn as 'outstanding'.

Headteacher of Small Heath School, Peter Slough, was told there were 'effective safeguarding procedures' in his classrooms, while leadership and governance was also 'outstanding'.

At Washwood Heath Academy, inspectors found governance and leadership to be 'good' adding students were 'well informed' both about other cultures and the risks of extremism and bullying, concluding pupils at the academy were well-rounded and believed it was 'acceptable to be different'.

At Small Heath, inspectors praised the high level of tolerance, stating in their letter to the head: 'A major strength of the school is that students value the differences between people of different beliefs, race and backgrounds.

'This has been achieved through a balanced curriculum for religious education and wide-ranging opportunities for personal development.'

Inspectors thought the school so good it went on to criticise local education authority Birmingham City Council because 'it has not done enough to help the school share its good practice with other schools in the city'.

At nearby Washwood Heath, students were found to be tolerant and well-behaved while there was consistently “strong leadership” from headteacher Beverley Mabey.

Inspectors concluded: 'They (students) know about risks related to religious extremism, sexual health, drug misuse, use of the internet and social media and different forms of bullying.

'Students are taught to respect the things that make people different such as sexual orientation, appearance, ability and race.

'Students say that it is acceptable to be different at the academy.'

Ofsted added the 'executive headteacher, and key members of the board of governors, have provided a strong lead on issues of religious extremism'.

Numerous media reports, quoting anonymous sources, have claimed Ofsted is poised to place several Birmingham schools into special measures after inspections sparked by an unsigned letter purporting to contain details of the alleged takeover plot.

Claims have also emerged that concerns about the management of a school embroiled in the row were first raised with council officials as early as 2008.

The Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council and West Midlands Police.

Meanwhile, PVET which runs Park View Academy, Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock School, said it would not comment on speculative and 'highly irresponsible' reports in the media based on Ofsted reports which had not yet been published.

Highlighting the academic success of Park View’s students, the trust said: 'If the inspectors who carried out both inspections at Park View Academy have ignored these achievements then we have to conclude that they are working to a different set of criteria than is normally used for an Ofsted inspection.'

The so-called Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year.

Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered.

It allegedly outlined a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools.

Whistleblowers at Park View have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body.

It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school.

The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area.

Police, the Government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in March.

The DfE has also appointed its own education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke for the investigation.

Yesterday, six schools at the centre of an alleged Islamist takeover plot are facing radical reform and even  closure after being officially judged as failing, it emerged last night.

A three-month inquiry has found the Birmingham schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated.

One of the six, Golden Hillock, was rated ‘inadequate’ in every criteria. A leaked copy of its Ofsted report says ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly.

However, three were today given 'outstanding' or 'good' results by the education watchdog.
