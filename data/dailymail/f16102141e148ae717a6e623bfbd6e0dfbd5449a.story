A councillor who left an expletive-laden message on a junior colleague's answerphone has been accused of being the 'Malcolm Tucker of local politics'.

Liverpool City Council’s Labour chief whip Councillor Alan Dean has been compared to the foul-mouthed spin doctor in the hit political comedy The Thick Of It after the voicemail was leaked online.

The character, played by new Doctor Who Peter Capaldi, is best known for his screaming tirades at Cabinet ministers and his underlings.

And Cllr Dean pulls a remarkable impersonation of Tucker in an answerphone message for former Labour councillor Jake Morrison.

'You have really p***** on your chips this time mate': Cllr Alan Dean, pictured left, has been compared to  Malcolm Tucker, the spin doctor in The Thick Of It, pictured right, after leaving a foul-mouthed rant on a young councillor's phone 

Cllr Dean can be heard on the voicemail asking Cllr Morrison 'what the hell he was playing at' after apparently telling a local paper he may step down after just one term in office.

He then continues his tirade, repeatedly swearing, before shouting: 'You have really p***** on your chips this time mate'.

Cllr Morrison, who became the city’s youngest elected councillor when he won an election aged 18 in 2011, was suspended shortly afterwards by the Labour party following complaints about his behaviour by fellow council member Wavertree MP Luciana Berger.

He claimed he was the victim of a 'witch-hunt' and wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband slamming Miss Berger as a 'privately-educated MP from London who has come to Liverpool to make my life a misery'.

He also complained to the city mayor 
that he wasn't happy that Cllr Dean was looking into Miss Berger's 
complaints because of the voicemail.

Cllr Morrison resigned from his post last month and has now uploaded the clip to Youtube and Facebook with the message: 'Just been clearing up my little desktop and found this voicemail I recorded.

'One for those know-it-alls who like to paint their own little picture about why I left the Labour Party.'

Cllr Morrison said he chose to release the tape now, more than three months after the phonecall, because: 'As time goes on, I’m getting criticised – people don’t know half the picture that went on and this is something I decided to do to quite clearly outline the way I was treated and something needs to be done about it.

'I just wanted to show people the way I was treated... it’s aggressive, it’s nasty, it was bullying as far as I’m concerned.

'The chief whip’s role is not just about punishing people, it’s about supporting people. Cllr Dean has been around in politics for 20 years, that’s how he speaks to someone who has been in it for two.

'He seems to think he’s the Malcolm Tucker of local politics.'

Cllr Alan Dean admitted he left the voicemail.

He added: 'It’s quite obvious that I left the voicemail message, I don’t deny that, I don’t retract anything I say in it.

'I was very angry at the time for what he had done and the way he behaved after all the support he got.'

Cllr Dean also denied that the tape reflected his typical style as party whip and claimed Cllr Morrison had 'stabbed us in the back'.

He added: 'I think people can draw their own conclusions from the fact of the date it was sent and the date it was published and that’s taken so long if he was so offended about it why has he published it so long [after]. I believe he’s got an ulterior motive in doing so.'
