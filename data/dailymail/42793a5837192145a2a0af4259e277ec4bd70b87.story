Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has broken 
his silence on the bullying scandal that has engulfed his team, saying 
he's appalled by the harassment Jonathan Martin reportedly faced.

Ross is due to meet with Martin tomorrow and said he had been contact with the former Dolphins tackle via text message.

The owner said the situation couldn't be a 'worse nightmare' and vowed to get to the bottom of the accusations and counter-accusations of harassment around his locker room.

'I think anybody would be appalled. When you first read that text that was reported, to me I didn't realize people would talk or text or speak that way to people,' he said at a joint press conference last night.

Tackling the issue: Team owner Stephen Ross said that he has been texting with Martin and plans to meet with him to discuss the allegations of abuse on Wednesday

His words of support for Martin appeared to be in stark contrast to the views of fans at Monday night's game.

Many showed up 
with handmade signs of support not for the alleged victim but his accused tormentor, Richie Incognito.

Incognito
has been suspended indefinitely following accusations he verbally abused Martin on a 
daily basis.

Ross will meet with Martin on Wednesday at an undisclosed location..

'I look forward to meeting with Jonathan Martin, discovering the facts,' Ross said.

'It couldn't have been a worse 
nightmare,' he said flanked by team 
president and chief executive officer Tom Garfinkel.

He added he wanted to create a locker room culture that 'suits the 21st 
century.'

The real estate developer who first bought a majority stake in the Dolphins in 2008 said he also planned to meet with Incognito saying he also 'deserved to be heard'.

The NFL is also investigating Martin's allegations against teammates, including Richie Incognito.

Martin,
24, is with his family in California and is due to undergo counseling for 
emotional issues. The 
6-foot-4, 320-pound player left the team two weeks ago.

His
attorney has alleged that Martin was harassed daily, and Incognito 
acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a 
racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap 
Martin's mother.

Incognito is white and Martin is biracial. Teammates both black and white have said Incognito is not a racist, and they've been more supportive of the veteran guard than they have of Martin.

Incognito, 6-3, 319 pounds, has long 
been labeled one of the NFL's dirtiest players with a reputation for 
out-of-bounds behavior off the field.

But
this season he was a member of the player leadership council, raising 
questions about the role of coach Joe Philbin, his staff and Miami 
management in the case.

A special investigator for the league 
will determine whether Incognito harassed Martin, and whether the 
Dolphins mishandled the matter.

Ross strongly endorsed Philbin, saying he had the 'utmost confidence' in the man he hired in 2012.

'Joe Philbin is probably one of the most organized people I've ever met,' Ross said.

'When
I interviewed him that stood out, but what also stood out was his 
character. I don't think there is a better person, a more respected 
person, a more caring person in the National Football League than Joe 
Philbin.'

While not holding Philbin responsible, Ross said changes need to be made in his organization.

'We need to look at ourselves. We have to examine everything internally,' Ross said.

'This
is so appalling to me. I know I'm capable of overreacting. I want to 
get everybody's feedback because we all know the football locker room is
a different workplace than most of us are accustomed to. I don't want 
to make any excuses.'

Ross 
said to he has formed a committee of advisers with five members who are 
tasked with protecting ‘me and them and the players from my 
overreacting, and having a code of conduct that suits the 21st century’.

‘Change is needed. We're going to make sure we're the best organization in the National Football League,' he said.

Also in question is the team's role in a May 2012 incident involving Incognito.

A police report said a female 
volunteer at a Dolphins charity golf tournament complained that 
Incognito harassed her, but he wasn't charged, and news of the case 
surfaced only last week.

Incognito, 30, has declined to say whether coaches ordered him to toughen up Martin, a second-year pro from Stanford.

Martin says he was harassed daily, and Incognito acknowledged leaving a voicemail for Martin in April in which he used a racist term, threatened to kill his teammate and threatened to slap Martin's mother

The scandal is the latest public-relations headache for Ross since he became majority owner of the Dolphins in 2009.

They've endured four consecutive losing seasons, their longest such streak since the 1960s, and often play in a half-empty stadium, their local popularity eclipsed by the Miami Heat.

Ross apologized to Dolphins fans 'for being in this position. I know we will come out of this as a better organization.'
