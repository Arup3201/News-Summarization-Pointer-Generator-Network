It's usually the players - not the spectators - who strike-out at baseball games.

But hopeless romantic David was thrown a curve ball after asking his girlfriend Jessica to marry him at a New Britain Rock Cats minor league game in Connecticut last week.

And judging by his reaction, it seems the brave Lothario wasn't prepared for the outcome.

SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH THE HUMILIATING REJECTION

Down on one knee: Spectators were shocked when 'Jessica' apparently rejected her boyfriend David's public proposal

All a ploy: The employee who acted out David looked anxious but excited as he prepared to ask his girlfriend Jessica if she will marry him

Romantic: The crowd saw David drop to one knee to propose

The couple were on the field answering questions when the announcer passed the microphone to David, who one commenter claims worked for the team.

'Will you marry me Jessica?' he asked.

Stepping back with her hands over her mouth, Jessica stammered: 'David, I'm sorry, I can't.'

She then sprinted out of the stadium as the announcer laughed.

'Sorry, I don't mean to laugh David, I don't think we've ever had this happen before,' he said.

The rejected suitor turned as red as his T-shirt as he ran out away, with the mascot still dancing around the field.

The Big Lead speculates the proposal could simply be a hoax, but the Huffington Post reckons 
the 'woman's off-microphone reaction seems pretty real'.Â 

Witness, John Poutre, commented on YouTube that he believed the proposal was legitimate.

'I was there, my first thought was that it was fake. But what would the point of that be?' he wrote.

'The
guy worked for the team in some way, he ran in the dugout (saw him 
later) and she ran out of the stadium. All I can say is KNOW THE ANSWER 
BEFORE ASKING!!!'

Shocked: Jessica, stepping backward, looks distressed as she rejects David's offer. Some believe her acting skills were lacklustre

Humiliating: David runs off the baseball field after Jessica tells him she doesn't want to marry him in the prank

Other Rock Cats fans, shocked at what they witnessed, took to Twitter to sympathize with David.

Donald
Salvesen tweeted on August 2: 'At the #rockcats game and we witnessed a rejected, 
on field marriage proposal. The crowd gasped, the players were laughing 
as the girl ran off humiliated. Very bizarre moment.'

Meanwhile, Anthony Falcone wrote: 'Just saw a rejected proposal onfield at this #rockcats game. So awkward and unfortunate.'

Professional
photographer Scott Blanchette managed to get a picture of the beaming 
wanna-be groom as he got down on one knee and held out his hands.

He
posted the image, which shows Jessica looking decidedly uncomfortable, 
wringing her hands, on Twitter with the comment: 'On field #proposal at 
the @RockCats game last night, she said no and ran off. :-('
