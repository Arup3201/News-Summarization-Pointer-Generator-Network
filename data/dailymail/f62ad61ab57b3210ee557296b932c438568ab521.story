Friends paid tribute to television chef Clarissa Dickson Wright, who has died at the age of 66

Friends of Clarissa Dickson Wright, the television chef and one half of Two Fat Ladies, who has died at the age of 66, paid tribute to her today.

Dickson Wright's agents, Heather Holden-Brown and Elly James, said she died on Saturday in Edinburgh’s Royal Infirmary and said she was 'loved dearly' by her friends.

They said Dickson Wright 'hadn't been well for a little while', and had been in hospital since the beginning of the year.  They declined to comment on the nature of her illness.

In a statement, the agents said: 'In recent years, Clarissa often said: "I’ve had a fantastic life and I’ve done everything I could have wanted to do and more".

'During her time in hospital, she was endlessly touched and impressed by the care of the doctors, nurses and support staff, aware of the pressure under which they worked and the fact that sometimes their work was not as valued as it should have been.

'Only a couple of weeks before her death, she was ringing friends asking them to check the (very occasional) general knowledge crossword clue she was struggling with.

'Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.

'Her fun and laughter, extraordinary learning and intelligence, will be missed always, by so many of us.'

Dickson Wright survived her on-screen cookery partner, Jennifer Paterson, the other star of Two Fat Ladies, who died from cancer at the age of 71 in 1999, bring the programme's four-year run to an end.

Brought together by television producer Patricia Llewellyn, who talked them in to making a pilot of the show, they were shown touring the UK in a motorcycle ridden by Paterson, with Dickson Wright in the sidecar, in search of good food.

Today Ms Llewellyn paid tribute to Dickson Wright, saying: 'Clarissa was possessed of a formidable intelligence, and held strong opinions, a powerful combination that made her a commanding presence on television.

'She had a fiery temper. We called her "Krakatoa" on location, because if you didn't notice the rumbling you could find yourself in trouble.

Dickson Wright's most recent TV work was a short BBC 4 series in 2012 called Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner

'She was a kind, generous and loyal 
friend with a fabulous sense of humour; I will miss her terribly, as 
will people all over the world.'

And a spokesman for the University 
of Aberdeen, where Dickson Wright was Rector from 1998-2004, said: 'She 
brought her individualism and style to many University of Aberdeen 
events - including the creation of a medieval feast in support of 
student hardship funds.

'She
 was very popular with the student body, bringing to this role an 
incisiveness which reflected her former career as a barrister.'

Edinburgh chef Tony Singh, who has appeared on shows including Ready Steady Cook and Great British Menu, said: 'Clarissa will be sorely missed.

'Her fun, feistiness and love for what she liked to cook and teach people about is what good food and great hospitality should be about.'

Dickson
 Wright, who lived in Inveresk, near Edinburgh, had had a long battle 
with alcoholism and her forthcoming birthday in June would have marked 
her 27th anniversary of ‘giving up alcohol’, a birthday which it was 
said 'meant much more to her than another year on the clock'.

Born in 1947, she was baptised Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright.

Her mother was an Australian heiress 
and her father was a surgeon to the Royal family but an alcoholic.  
Dickson Wright, who grew up in a nine-bedroom house in St John's Wood, 
north London, later described 'taking cover' when he was very drunk and 
'extremely violent'.

Initially trained as a lawyer, 
Dickson Wright - who inherited a fortune from her mother - became the 
country's youngest barrister at 21.  But crippling depression brought on
 by her parents' deaths led to her drinking, and alcoholism soon brought
 her legal career to an abrupt end.

She
 claimed that during her drinking years, she once had sex with an MP 
behind the Speaker's chair in the House of Commons, and by 1983 she was 
homeless and had to live with friends.

Always a keen cook, she worked as a cook in a St James’s club and in 
private houses, and went on to run the cookery bookshop Books for Cooks 
in London’s Notting Hill.  She then moved to Edinburgh, where she ran 
the Cooks Book Shop.

While she was living there, she met Patricia Llewellyn, who introduced her to Paterson, and after a successful pilot show, Two Fat Ladies 
was first broadcast in 1996.

Two Fat Ladies ran from 1996 until 1999 when it ended with the death of Jennifer Paterson from cancer

A staunch supporter of the Countryside Alliance, Dickson Wright once suggested people should badgers

Three years ago she published her prize-winning A History of English Food  in 2011.

In
 1998 Dickson Wright was made the first female Rector of the University 
of Aberdeen, taking up the role in memory of her grandmother, a native 
of the Granite City.

A keen member of the Countryside Alliance, two years ago, she incurred the wrath of the animal rights lobby when she suggested that Britons should eat badgers.

'It would solve the problem. There's going to be a cull, so rather than just throw them in the landfill site, why not eat them?' she said.

Her agent added today: 'Clarissa was born and raised as a Catholic and her faith remained with her, in her own personal way, for the rest of her life, a life lived fearlessly and with conviction.'
