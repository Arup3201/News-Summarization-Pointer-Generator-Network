Drunk inmates from Darwin Correctional Centre have been caught escaping prison grounds and returning with contraband including bottles of alcohol and 'green leafy substance'.

This was discovered when prison guards responded to an altercation involving five intoxicated prisoners were fighting over a mobile phone at about 12.35 on July 20.

Upon reviewing CCTV footage, police say at least four prison inmates jumped the prison fence on the night of July 19 between 7pm and 11pm.

A spokesman for the Northern Territory Department of Correctional Services says the prisoners from the low-security section, at Berrimah which is Darwin's eastern suburbs, had returned positive readings when they were breathalysed.

'They were transferred to maximum security immediately,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'This is now under police investigation.'

The spokesman said a search of the work release centre uncovered contraband including two empty bottles of spirits, five mobile phones, phone chargers, some 'green leafy substance' believed to be marijuana, scissors, tobacco and rolling papers.

It is believed the four men escaped and returned between scheduled head counts at 7pm and 11pm.

'It is alleged that four of the prisoners had climbed a fence to retrieve contraband items from someone on the outside,' the spokesman said.

'The five prisoners are still in maximum security and charges have not yet been laid.'
