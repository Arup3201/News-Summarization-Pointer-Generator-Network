A Brazilian teenager told today how he got through tight security to meet England players at the team's Rio hotel - just by waving an out-of-date room key card he'd found on the street.

Abraao Paiva de Mesquita, 18, claimed he walked straight past police, army troops and security staff at the Royal Tulip hotel to make it to the outdoor swimming pool, where members of the squad were relaxing.

Abraao, who lives in the nearby violent Rocinha favela, said he was never searched or asked for ID as he wandered the hotel's corridors looking for England stars.

And he managed to pull of the same 
feat for two days running before he was finally confronted by a member 
of staff, and asked to leave.

England
 fan Abraao collected selfies on his mobile phone with Roy Hodgson and 
eight players including Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, and even 
convinced goalkeeper Joe Hart to hand over his England shirt.

He
 said: 'It was simple. I just walked in and said I was a guest, and 
waved the magnetic room card that I'd found one day on the street.

'I knew it would come in handy one day.

'I went straight past hotel reception no questions asked, just saying good afternoon to people along the way.'

He said he would wait in a corridor leading to the hotel swimming pool, knowing the England players would have to walk past him.

He said: 'Football players are human too. I knew they wouldn't see me there and completely ignore me.'

Abraao also took selfies with Gary Cahill, Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshire and Joe Hart.

He said: 'I learned a bit of English before I arrived. I just said, 'photo, I and you' and they would oblige. When Joe Hart passed by I said, 'Give me your shirt. I am your fan'.

'I didn't get the photo I really wanted though, with Wayne Rooney. I'm hoping to find him before they leave. It's going to be a bit more difficult now though, now the security guards know who I am.'

After being chosen by Roy Hodgson as England's base during their stay in Brazil, hotel bosses at the Royal Tulip pledged to tighten security to ensure the safety of players.

The five star hotel, in Rio's Sao Conrado district, is just streets away from the sprawling Rocinha slum, the scene of frequent gun battles between drug gangs and the police in recent months.

In 2010 gang members on the run from police stormed the hotel, taking 35 people hostage. One woman was killed in crossfire.

Hotel bosses say it has undergone a £2million revamp, with the players' rooms enjoying new furniture, beds, flooring and air conditioning.
