January Jones eptomises the Hollywood blonde bombshell.

But the peroxide addicted Mad Men actress recently revealed that her constantly changing hair colour has sparked every glamorous girl's nightmare: hair loss.

'I have been every colour and now my hair is falling out in clumps,' the star, who is a natural light blonde, admitted. 'I’m going to have to shave it off and wear a wig.'

Hair crisis: While January Jones looked her best as she walked the red carpet at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, the newly blonde star has revealed her hair is falling out

January, who plays icy blonde Betty Draper on the hit TV series, has previously been a brunette and redhead in her acting career.  

Speaking about her ever evolving hair, she told ABC News: 'I like it all colours, it makes you feel different according to what colour it is, but I prefer to be blonde.'

But it seems the 35-year-old is paying the price for her luscious light locks.

According to experts, hair loss is caused by bleaching or dyeing treatments that take place too closely together.

The treatments strip your hair of its natural moisture and can damage the follicle leading to breakage.

Jo Hansford MBE, a hair colour specialist whose clients include Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Adele, said: 'Extreme changes in hair colour can result in very damaged and over-processed hair, which is why a lot of actresses use wigs when they need to change their look for a role.

'Colour changes from brunette to blonde can be achieved safely but they are never instant – the technique and application of the colour is crucial and it needs to be a gradual process to ensure the condition of the hair is not compromised.

'It is always essential to consult a colour specialist when considering any colour change, as they will recommend the safest way to achieve your desired result without damaging your hair or causing any hair loss.

And it seems that January isn't alone with both Lady Gaga and Kelly Osbourne also reportedly suffering hair loss because of hair dye.  

Damaged: January now says her constantly changing hair colour has caused it to 'fall out in clumps'

Kelly admitted three years ago to getting bald patches after a hair colourist forgot about her in the chair. 

Lady Gaga, a natural brunette, has also spoken honestly about the difficulties of maintaining her platinum blonde look.

'[I] must occasionally get a chemical haircut because my blonde hair is falling out,' she told People magazine.

'When I have a client who is forever changing their hair colour, I always make sure they're 100% committed to looking after it… especially when going this blond!

'I highly recommend the Nicky Clarke Intensive Moisture Mask, weekly, which hydrates the hair from within. I also make sure that they are using less heat during the lightening process by cutting down on straightening and by using heat protection sprays and oils/

'But my top tip: avoid tying your hair up wet. Your hair dries in its stretched state and then becomes brittle and susceptible to breakage,' added Ciaran Capuano, Colour Technician at Nicky Clarke

Fellow sufferers: Lady Gaga and Kelly Osbourne have both admitted to suffering from hair loss like January

Jason Cocking, celebrity hairstylist and Director of Lisa Shepherd London, said:
 'With more options for our hair than ever, it's hard to resist the 
temptation to try every new colour trend or catwalk style on offer.' Here are his top tips...

DON’T… -  Get distracted when dying your hairYou may think keeping the colour on longer will make it stronger, but it will also be stripping your hair of moisture. Try not to get too caught up in your favourite soap  – Always remember to watch the clock!-  Overlap the dyeWhen colouring your roots be sure not to colour over areas that have been dyed before. Dying it twice will do double the damage.-  Repeatedly use permenant dyes Try using semi-permanent colours; these will be gentler on the hair and will enhance the shine as well as improving the condition.  -  Be afraid to dye your hair every 6 weeksBe sure just to focus ONLY on the bits that need topped up e.g. the roots or grey hairs, don’t be tempted to do the whole head.DO….-  Try some daily moisturising treatmentsOn the week running up to dying your hair try to treat your hair every day to a conditioning treatment. E.g. Oribe’s Signature Moisture Masque.-  Always finish the dyeing process with a finishing treatment Try  Clynol’s Keratin Filler, a spray in treatment, which strengthens the hair.
