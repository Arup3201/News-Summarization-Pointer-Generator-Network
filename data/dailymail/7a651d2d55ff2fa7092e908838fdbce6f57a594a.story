A $5,000 reward is being offered to track down the person responsible for injuring Henry the Boston terrier so badly that he had to be put down.

A passerby found Henry limping badly and covered in burns in the El Monte area of Los Angeles and took him to a local animal shelter.

The shelter passed Henry on to a specialised Boston Terrier rescue organisation, Boston Buddies, in the hope of saving him.

Chemical burns: Henry the Boston terrier was so badly disfigured that only pictures of his face can be shown

When Charla Hall from Boston Buddies took him to the vet, he whimpered for the entire hour on the way from the pain of his burns.

She could only soothe him by stroking the small patch of his head that was not burned.

The vet said that some type of caustic chemical that had been poured on him.

In addition to the damage to his skin, one of Henry’s eyes was ulcerated – perhaps another result of chemical torture.

The only thing the vet could do was to put Henry down.

Justice for Henry: The public were so outraged by the cruelty Henry suffered that they raised money for a reward

Henry's injuries were so horrific that only pictures of his face can be shown as the rest of his body is too disfigured. 

Charla Hall, who was in tears, told local TV station KTLA: 'What I saw was the hardest thing that I have ever had to deal with

She could not believe that someone could be so cruel to such a 'small and kind' animal.

When Boston Buddies posted Henry’s story online, the public were so outraged that they offered donations for a reward to catch the person responsible.

Hall told KTLA: 'If that person could do this to an innocent dog, it’s only a matter of time before they progress to people.

'We’d like to do everything we can to get them off the streets.'

Henry did have a microchip implanted in him but unfortunately, the chip was never registered.

The L.A. County Department of Animal Care and Control has also opened an investigation.
