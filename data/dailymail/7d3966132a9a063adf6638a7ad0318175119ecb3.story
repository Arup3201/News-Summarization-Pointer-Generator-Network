She has wept, screamed, shouted and pouted her way through six whole series of The Only Way Is Essex.

But Lauren Goodger has decided to 'shut up' once and for all and has handed her notice in to TOWIE bosses.

The 25-year-old has officially left the reality show amid rumours she will join ITV's Dancing On Ice, when it begins in January.

Emotional: Lauren will make her final appearance in tonight's episode of TOWIE

Lauren will make her final appearance on TOWIE tonight (Wednesday), before bidding farewell to the show that made her a household name.

Representatives for TOWIE told MailOnline: 'I can confirm Lauren Goodger will be taking a break and won't appear in the next series of The Only Way Is Essex'.

The decision for Lauren to leave was mutual after six series on TV screens.

A source told The Sun newspaper: 'Lauren knows she is not an integral part of Towie any more, so she’s decided to jump ship.

'An opportunity to do Dancing On Ice came along and she's jumped at the chance.'

However, the door will always be open for her to return in the future with an insider telling Mail Online: 'The show has an open door policy now that will allow stars to come and go.

'We might even see Mark Wright return properly one day. We feel this evolves the show and keeps the format and genre fresh.'

Lauren hopes that she will be able to convert the public into liking her after they see a different side to her with the help of former Olympic skaters Jane Torvill and Christopher Dean.

Since starting on the show in October 2010 viewers have watched Lauren's troubled love life with Essex bad boy Mark Wright - even resulting in a brief engagement.

The pair split but Lauren has continued to profess her love for her ex constantly, even though she has had fleeting dates with other co-stars, namely Tom Pearce.

A new executive producer has been drafted in ahead of the next series and will be looking at getting fresh faces into the show.

A spokesperson for TOWIE said: 'All the cast will be reviewed before we start the next series of The Only Way Is Essex.'

Goodger rose to fame as her on/off relationship with Wright became compelling viewing before he moved on to bigger projects.

However, the curvy star is still not completely over him as she admitted earlier this month during a drunken text rant.

After being ejected from Faces 
nightclub she tweeted: 'I want to die just been asked to leave faces cos
mark was in there I am having a panic attack never been so hurt in my 
life I still love him.' (sic)

The
following morning she said: 'Shouldn't leave my phone laying around.. 
Drunken tweets never make sense! Anyway new day 2day can't wait for this
hangover 2 go!#dying x.'
