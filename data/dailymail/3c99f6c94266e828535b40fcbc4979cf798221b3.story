The most exciting thing about Jos Buttler is that he can hit 360 degrees — he can play almost any shot, anywhere.

That’s not to say we should be expecting him to open his box of tricks in a Test match. It would be completely unfair to burden him with that. But from what we’ve seen of him so far in limited-overs cricket for England, the boy has got some serious talent.

Nice move: Jos Buttler and England warm up with a game of touch rugby at Ageas Bowl on Thursday

His hand-eye coordination and bat speed are exceptional — a bit like Eoin Morgan’s. He has strong wrists, which may help explain his prowess at squash, and obviously a good deal of self-confidence. It’s a combination that can make him very hard to bowl to.

We saw during his fantastic 121 off 74 balls in that one-dayer against Sri Lanka at Lord’s in May that, by the end, they didn’t know where to bowl. He was just smashing them over extra cover for six.

Of course, Test cricket is a different beast. There are slips and a gully in pretty well all the time, and the edges that might fly to third man in a one-day game can end up in a fielder’s hands in a Test match.

There are times when I’ve watched him play red-ball cricket that he has gone hard at the ball early on and that can lead to nicks. So he’ll need time to adjust — just as he will behind the stumps.

You still need a technique to survive in Test cricket. Players such as Alec Stewart and Matt Prior  had exactly that and we saw at Lord’s with MS Dhoni that a keeper-batsman can struggle with lateral movement if his technique isn’t quite up to scratch.

But the natural talent is clearly there. He plays the ramp shot differently from Tillekeratne Dilshan with his Dilscoop. Dilshan goes down early and hits the ball back over his head, with the blade of the bat facing him.

Buttler stands up, shimmies across his stumps — but not so far that he’s exposing them too much — and watches the ball. He doesn’t try to overhit and keeps his head in line with the ball. He has a strong bottom hand and almost rubbery wrists, and has the confidence to go through with the stroke.

The result can be that bowlers then go wide outside off to stop him playing the ramp, but then he responds with a kind of reverse-scoop or swat over backward point. If the bowlers go full, he sets himself early and gets his front leg out of the way. Because his hands are so quick, he can latch on to anything that isn’t quite yorker length and has the leverage to hit it over the top.

There was a one-dayer against South Africa at Edgbaston in 2012 when they had set the field to stop him playing the ramp so instead he just stood up and hit everything in the V. He absolutely destroyed them.

The question is whether he can transfer this mindset into Test cricket, though of course all these exciting shots are mainly for the one-day game.

People have to realise he could take a while to adapt to the longer form, just as it took a while  for Buttler to convince everyone he could do a job for England in  limited-overs cricket.

But, with the English game at such a low ebb right now, he is definitely worth getting excited about.
