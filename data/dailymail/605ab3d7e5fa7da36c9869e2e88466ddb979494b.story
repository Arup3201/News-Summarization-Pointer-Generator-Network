A block of flats made out of shipping containers has been officially opened in a bid to tackle a city's housing crisis.

Brighton Housing Trust is using the 36 adapted containers to provide temporary accommodation for homeless people in the city.

The containers have been transformed into self-contained studio flats, and feature bathrooms, kitchens and plasterboard walls.

The flats include bathrooms and kitchens and have been furnished with beds, wardrobes, drawers, bedside cabinets and other household equipment

The housing trust and developer QED Property Ltd submitted the plans for the scheme to help solve the 'acute shortage of affordable accommodation' in the city.

High property prices averaging around £302,000, steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside city have contributed to high levels of homelessness.

Following the scheme's official opening last week, Andy Winter, chief executive of Brighton Housing Trust, said: 'Over the last decade, BHT has been successful in helping our clients secure and keep accommodation, but this is the first new accommodation we have been involved in producing for almost 15 years.

'There is an acute shortage of affordable accommodation in Brighton and Hove. 

'The number of street homeless people in the city has increased from 37 in November 2011 to 43 in 2012 and 50 in November 2013. 

'However, there is a wide consensus that the actual figure is more likely to be between 70 and 100.

'This development makes a small contribution to tackling the ever-increasing need for housing in the Brighton and Hove.'

The structures were designed for a social housing project in Amsterdam two years ago but the scheme had to be abandoned after hitting funding difficulties.

Ross Gilbert, from developers QED Property, said last week: 'It is just six weeks since the arrival of the first container on site. Today is the high point of this exciting and innovative housing project as the 36 residents move into their new homes.

'Our temporary use of land earmarked for future regeneration demonstrates just what can be done in the interim to help solve the acute housing shortage'

Retailer Homebase, which has used shipping containers in its adverts, has provided starter packs for the 36 residents.

The packs include beds, wardrobes, chests of drawers, bedside cabinets and kitchen and other household equipment.

Graham Heald, Homebase retail and distribution director, said: 'We are delighted to be supporting this creative initiative, which is supporting the local community with short-term, affordable accommodation.

'Although this isn’t a long term solution for homelessness, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a home they love, and so we’re providing starter packs to each tenant which enables them to do just that.

'By providing furniture, tenants will have a ready-made home waiting for them to move into, that will provide a comfortable and stable environment in their day to day lives.'

In October, MailOnline reported how shipping containers from China, transformed into studio apartments, were being billed as a solution to London's housing crisis.

Planning permission has been granted to the Forest Young Man's Christian Association (YMCA) to establish two sites featuring the containers in Waltham Forest, north-east London.

The 'mYPads' - which cost £20,000 each - are designed to allow young people to have their own rental accommodation but at a price that allows them to save up for a deposit.

Forward-thinking architects have come up with a new way to solve the UK's chronic housing shortage - converting garages into tiny homes.

A row of out-of-use lock-ups on a council estate are due to be turned into cosy bedsits for young professionals and people unable to find a home.

Tenants will have to pay just £11 a week for the mini houses, which are set to cost around £13,000 to convert.

Earlier this year an architecture firm unveiled plans to convert disused garages into a row of miniature homes

The designs were inspired by a row of garages which have been standing unused on the Lockner Estate in Dalston, East London.

Architecture firm Levitt Bernstein has proposed to set up its 'pop-up' homes in spaces like the garages which are awaiting permanent redevelopment.

Each home will measure 11.5 square metres, and contain a bed, kitchen and bathroom, with room for a small table and two chairs.

Every fifth garage is set to be turned into a communal area, with a laundry, extra kitchen equipment and a dining space.

The homes will be built off-site and assembled by apprentices - and if the site is redeveloped, existing units can be dismantled and used elsewhere.

The project is known as Pop-up HAWSE - standing for Homes through Apprenticeships With Skills for Employment.

It was the winner of a housing design competition organised by the Building Trust, a charity which aims to encourage sustainable architecture in deprived areas.

If it is successful, the scheme will be expanded to other parts of London and throughout the UK, concentrating on areas where there are lots of homeless people or a shortage of housing for the young.

The architects are already in talks with a number of local authorities in hope of launching similar schemes.
