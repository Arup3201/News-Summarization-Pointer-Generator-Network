Jonas Gutierrez has signalled his readiness to step into the depths of a crisis which is threatening to end Newcastle's season with a whimper.

The 31-year-old Argentinian has been used as a substitute in the Magpies' last two games after his return to the squad following a successful battle against testicular cancer.

However, as head coach John Carver prepares for Saturday's Barclays Premier League fixture against Arsenal at St James' Park with suspension and injury severely limiting his options, Gutierrez is offering his services in whatever role he is needed.

He told the Journal: 'Three years ago when we finished fifth, I played in many positions. I was playing in different positions because we had problems with injuries.

'I'm here to help. I work hard and I want to enjoy. Always, I have to do the best for the team.

'We have to finish in the top 10. We don't have any excuses. We have hard games up to the finish of the season, but we have to take points and finish in the top 10.'

A winger by trade, Gutierrez played as a full-back for his country at the 2010 World Cup finals, and that ability could come in useful during the remaining weeks of the season.

Skipper and close friend Fabricio Coloccini will miss the next three games after failing in a bid to have the red card he received at Everton on Sunday overturned on appeal, and with Steven Taylor and Paul Dummett out for the rest of the season through injury, Mike Williamson is the club's only recognised senior central defender.

That could mean a move inside for right-back Daryl Janmaat against the Gunners, and with the Dutchman currently the club's only fit specialist full-back, Gutierrez could be required to slot into a re-shaped back four, as Ryan Taylor has done in recent weeks, although Carver will hope to have Massadio Haidara ready for the weekend.

Newcastle have won only one of their last six games and scored just three goals in the process, and with leading marksman Papiss Cisse just one match into his seven-game ban, their hopes of a top-10 finish appear to be receding.

Gutierrez said: 'We don't have enough players at the moment. Colo is banned for three games. But we have to keep together and work hard for the manager.

'The manager will tell us what we have to do. We have to do it right on the pitch. No excuses, we have to do it better.'
