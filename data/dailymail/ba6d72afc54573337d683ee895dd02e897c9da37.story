A private sixth form is set to move lessons to start at 1.30pm every day because the school's teacher thinks his teenage pupils will study better after a morning lie in.

Instead of rising early for a 9am start, pupils at the £15,000-a-year Hampton Court House, in East Molesey, Surrey, will get to enjoy a lie in and work from 1.30pm until 7pm.

Head teacher Guy Holloway says the move for all sixth form pupils, set to kick in from September, has been made in light of research by neuroscientists.

He predicts that not only will his students aged 16 and upwards get a quality night's sleep, but their cognition and productivity will also be improved.

The co-educational school will have the latest start time in the UK, and will be the only one to begin lessons in the afternoon.

Experts say young people are biologically programmed to get up later, and that rather than this being down to laziness it is simply a shift in their body clocks.

In 2007 the Hugh Christie Technology College in Tonbridge, Kent, introduced an 11.30am start three days a week start for all students aged 14 and above.

And in 2010 Monkseaton High School, North Tyneside, moved its 9am start to 10am.. Both schools say the later start has boosted their student’s levels of concentration and exam performance.

However, Hampton Court House has gone further with its 'no mornings' regime.

'There are 168 hours in a week and how productive they are depends on how they choose to use those hours,' said Mr Holloway.

'At Hampton Court House we don’t think we have the answer for everybody, it’s about what works in our community.

'We want to get them into an environment where they can get quality sleep and their bodies are functioning well.'

Late start: Instead of rising early for a 9am start pupils at the £15,000-a-year school in East Molesey, Surrey, will get to enjoy a lie in and work from 1.30pm until 7pm

He said pupils would also benefit from reduced journey times as they travel to and from school after rush hour.

Year 10 student Gabriel Purcell-Davis will be one of the first of 30 A-level students to start at the later time.

'I want to wake up in my bed, not in my maths lesson,' said the 15-year-old.

Lessons for all other pupils at the school will still begin at 9am as usual.

The move is based on research by Russell Foster, who said teenagers have a biological predisposition to go to bed later and get up later.

Neuroscientists have also linked better sleep in teenage years with improved mental health.

Research
 associate Paul Kelley, who is working with Dr Foster on his latest 
sleep research at Oxford University, said moving sleeping patterns later
 benefited health and that teenagers performed better after a good 
night’s rest.

'You can’t train your system to get up at a practical time,' he said.

'It’s
 biological, just as your heartbeat, your liver function and a bunch of 
other things that all sync to natural biological time and that is not in
 your control.

'Anything you do to change the rhythmic systems of your body means your organs become desynchronised with each other and this is where people get ill and there is no fixing it by giving someone an alarm clock.

'Your body is not watching your wristwatch.'

The move has been met with scepticism from other school heads in the area.

Lesley Kirby, head of nearby Richmond Park Academy, said they had considered a slightly later start, but it would inconvenience teaching staff too much.

She added: 'It is also important for the main school to see sixth formers as successful role models who are carrying on their education and that is not present if they see them for a very short period of the day.

'Then what are these students going to do when they have a 9am lecture at university, or start work? They won't be able to go in during the afternoon.

'School is about training people in living effective lives and I don't think this is effective as it would be quite difficult to make the change back. I would also wonder how robust the science is.'
