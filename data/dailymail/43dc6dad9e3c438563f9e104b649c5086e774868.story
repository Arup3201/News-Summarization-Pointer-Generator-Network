The 'shattered' friends of coward punch victim Jake Stephenson have expressed their support, posting on Facebook that he is 'the most placid dude'.

Those close to the 21-year-old from the Nowra on the NSW south coast have expressed their disbelief that Mr Stephenson was in a coma, writing 'there is no way Jake would have started anything.'

'Prayers go out to Jake Stephenson and his family through this time. Can't believe how some people carry on. You can pull through mate,' posted one friend.

Coward punch victim has been identified as Jake Stephenson, from NSW's south coast

'Absolutely shattered to find out one of you're mates has been put in a coma from some f******* coward,' wrote another.

'So messed up! Can't believe this has happened to Stevo,' a friend of the South Coast man replied. 

Mr Stephenson was discharged from hospital on Sunday after his condition approved. Around the same time, a 32-year-old man presented himself to police.

Early on Monday he was charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm and will appear in court on November 19. 

On Sunday, Mr Stephenson and his alleged attacker were involved in an argument outside a fast food restaurant  in Bondi about 12.40am. 

Mr Stephenson ran off but was followed and punched to ground. He was then allegedly kicked in the chest as he lay unconscious on the pavement.

Eastern Suburbs acting superintendent Chris Stiles said the victim had been watching a soccer game before visiting Bondi with friends, 9News reported.

Mr Stephenson's friends were not there at the time of the incident. 

'I think all police and all local members of the community would be disgusted by the attack,' Supt Stiles said. 

Friends have expressed shock over the incident and say they are 'shattered'

Earlier on Sunday, police reviewed CCTV footage captured at a nearby fast food outlet with the hope it would help identify the attacker.

This incident was one of numerous violent attacks which took place at the beach-side suburb on Saturday night.

A man was hit in the head with a brick and robbed by two men just one street away from Campbell Parade.

Meanwhile, two women were assaulted, and a drunken brawl also broke out at neighbouring suburb Bondi Junction.

Police do not believe these incidents were related to the one-punch attack.

Supt Stiles said there was no link between lockout laws enforced in Sydney's city area has caused anti social behaviour in other suburbs.

'We're always prepared for a busy summer in Bondi. It's always busy. No different from any other year,' he said.

David Hona, 20, was sentenced to a minimum four years for bashing Michael McEwen (pictured) in Bondi last year

The latest cowardly attack comes as a young man who brutally bashed and stomped on IT consultant Michael McEwen in Bondi last year will remain behind bars until at least 2019. 

David Hona, 20, was sentenced to a minimum of four years and nine months with a maximum jail term of six years and nine months on Friday. 

The vicious and unprovoked assault left Mr McEwen in an induced coma for eight days, and doctors had to remove a part of his skull to save his life. 

Another young victim Jack Hansen-Bartel, from Adelaide, has spoken out last week about being the victim of an unprovoked attack at a nightclub in Koh Samui in Thailand in June.

The 20-year-old was celebrating after graduating from high school in Bangkok when he received injuries so severe that it will take about 18 months to undergo all of the required surgeries - and he is only expected to have an 80 per cent recovery.

Samui police charged two graduating students from an international school in China over the incident but six weeks later, the students made charges of their own against Hansen-Bartel, alleging they were protecting a female friend and claiming he was 'molesting' her but he denies these accusations.
