Promises: Labour welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves will vow to raise the minimum wage, introduce Living Wage contracts and build homes

Labour will today hit out at the ballooning cost of housing benefit for working families – despite opposing all attempts by the Coalition to cut the bill.

Shadow minister Rachel Reeves will unveil analysis showing that the number of employed people claiming the hand-out is set to double from 2010 to 2018. 

The extra cost during these years will be £12.9billion or £488 for each household in Britain, she will claim. 

In a speech at Pudsey, West Yorkshire, Miss Reeves will say it is wrong that a benefit meant for the poorest is increasingly propping up the income of low-paid workers.

She will also condemn the Tory record on welfare as one of ‘failure and waste’. 

Labour promises to cut the housing benefit bill by raising the minimum wage and encouraging firms to pay the so-called living wage. 

The welfare spokeswoman will say: ‘The number of working people claiming housing benefit is set to double because the Tory Government has failed to tackle low pay, insecure work and the cost-of-living crisis.

‘That’s meant thousands more people have been forced to rely on housing benefit to make ends meet. 

'Labour will raise the minimum wage, introduce Living Wage contracts and get 200,000 homes built a year by 2020 to tackle the housing benefit bill and ensure working people can make ends meet.’

Miss Reeves will also say that Mr Duncan Smith has wasted huge amounts with his flagship Universal Credit welfare reforms. She called for a three month pause while the National Audit Office investigates it.

‘Iain Duncan Smith promised a million people would be on Universal Credit by April 2014,’ she said. ‘But the latest figures show less than 6,000 people are claiming.

‘At the current rate of progress it would take a staggering 1,222 years for Universal Credit to be rolled out across the country.’

She will add: ‘Next May there is a big choice for the British people on social security.

‘A Tory economy based on low wages, failing programmes, waste and rising costs, or a Labour future with reforms to make work pay, tackle waste and reward people who do the right thing to get social security spending under control. That’s The Choice.’

Waste: The welfare reforms brought in by Iain Duncan Smith, left, should be paused, Miss Reeves said. But Welfare Minister Mark Harper, right, blamed Labour for leaving the Coalition with a 'culture of dependency'

A Conservative source said the level of housing benefit for working people began to rise under Labour – not under the Coalition.

Welfare minister Mark Harper said: ‘We inherited an out-of-control housing benefit system from Labour that created a culture of dependency. Their system saw some people claiming £104,000 a year of hardworking taxpayers’ money to live in expensive areas.

‘We’ve capped benefits so no family can claim more than the average family gets by going out to work and we’ve put an end to unlimited housing benefit. This is all part of our-long-term economic plan to build a welfare system that provides a safety net for those in need, while rewarding the willingness to work.

‘But Labour haven’t learnt their lesson. They voted against our housing benefit cap, they voted against our overall cap on benefits and they still plan to borrow and spend more by restoring the spare room subsidy – landing future generations with more debt than they can ever hope to repay.’
