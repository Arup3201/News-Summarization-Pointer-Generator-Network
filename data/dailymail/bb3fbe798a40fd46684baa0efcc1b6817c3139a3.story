Home to roost: Andrew Biddle, 45, has returned to New Jersey after months on the run

A boat racing champion who allegedly faked his own death at sea to avoid facing up to a string of fraud allegations has returned and surrendered to police.

Andrew Biddle, 45, went sailing with a friend in July off the coast of New Jersey - but their pontoon motorboat crashed at 11:30pm in what seemed like an accident.

Despite an 18-hour search by coast guards, there was no sign of Biddle - and a few weeks later police claimed the accident was cover so he could flee criminal prosecution for alleged fraud connected to his boating business.

However, after almost seven months on the run, Biddle has returned to Egg Harbor township, New Jersey, and has faced a court in a bail hearing, according to the Press of Atlantic City.

Biddle, who has won powerboat racing events in the U.S. and also in Britain, began the legal process Thursday, appearing at a bail hearing in Atlantic County Superior Court.

According to the paper, Biddle has until tonight to post a $50,000 bail or be taken to jail before facing the fraud accusations.

According to local law enforcement, Biddle committed a string of unscrupulous transactions as the manager of Professional Boat Sales, in Egg Habor, New Jersey.

Responsibility? Biddle's attorney said that a sense of responsibility towards his wife, left, helped drive him back

The allegations include selling a boat without paying its owner back, lying about the cost of items, and taking downpayments on a boat without ever providing it.

After the initial coast guard search, which spanned a 60-mile length of sea, authorities became suspicious of the boat crash.

Police in the township soon declared themselves 'skeptical' of the notion the crash was accidental - and some observed how unlikely the accident would have been for a seasoned sailor who knew the waters well.

Biddle's attorney seemed to imply he had been living as a fugitive at sea.

Mark Roddy said: 'I know him well enough to know his knowledge of the oceans is phenomenal. This is a guy who, had he wanted to stay out there forever, he could have.'

However, he would not discuss in detail where he had been. According to Roddy, he was called out of the blue by Biddle, who said he wanted to 'step up to the plate' and faces the charges.

The lawyer added that his sudden return was promptly partly out of concern for his wife and children.

It is not clear whether his time on the run will result in any additional charges.
