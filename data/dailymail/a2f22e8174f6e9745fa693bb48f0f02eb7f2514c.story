A young woman found unconscious during a police drug raid at a Sydney dance festival has died.

More than five thousand people attended the dance party at Mrs Macquarie's Chair on Saturday.

The Longueville woman was taken to St Vincent's hospital, Darlinghurst but later died, police said.

A 19-year-old Longueville woman (not pictured, unrelated stock image) has died from a suspected drug overdose after she was found unconscious at Sydney dance party Harbourlife on Saturday

The dance party was held at Mrs Macquarie's Chair near Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens

The 19-year-old was treated by paramedics at the scene and transported to St Vincents hospital, Darlinghurst where she died

Officers, meanwhile, arrested 78 people at the event for drug offences.

Inspector Stewart Leggat of City Central Local Area Command warned about the dangers of taking illegal drugs, emphasising there was no quality control in their production.

"Quite simply, you don't know what you are getting - seeking a synthetic high, could result in a serious injury or death," he said.

"If you know of a business or person who may be involved in the sale of illegal synthetic substances, please contact Crime Stoppers immediately. We don't need to know who you are, all we need is the information you have.

"The information you provide could save someone's life."

Investigations into the woman's death are continuing.
