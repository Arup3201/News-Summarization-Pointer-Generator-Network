Animal-lover Fran Bailey knows a pet is for life - so she has had the faces of five of her dead cats tattooed on her back.

Dedicated Fran, of Newtown, in the Powys region of Wales, had the pictures permanently inked on her skin so can always remember her beloved pets.

The life-size portraits of Tinky, Woody, Mr Brush, Mr Spock and Bella take up most of her back.

Tribute: But Fran, right, admits she probably won't get the five cats she currently cares for tattooed on her back as well. Pictured right is Woody, one of her dead pets

Fran, 23, said: 'I love my cats and I love my tattoo. A lot of people who have lost pets can relate to it.

'I
adopt sick cats because I wanted them to have somewhere to go - I took 
them home so they could live out their last days in comfort.

'If I keep going, tattooing all the pets I will have in my lifetime, I'd just be covered in cats.'

Fran took in the cats from animal shelters and cared for them at her home, nursing the pets back to health.

Each of the tattoos incorporates an element of the cat's personality - Tinky is shown with worms in his mouth

When they died, she decided to get a permanent tribute to the ill-fated animals - starting off with a set of small paw prints.

But the design grew, incorporating 'elements of each one's personalities' until it finally covered her whole back.

Fran, who works as a tattoo artist, said: 'I first started the tattoo for three cats and then added another two later.

'I've got five more cats now and if they die I think I'll pay tribute to them symbolically instead of getting more tattoos.'

Remembrance: Pictured is Fran's cat Brush, who is depicted wearing a monocle in the tattoo
