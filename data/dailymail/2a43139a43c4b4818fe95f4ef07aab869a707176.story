A group of mothers whose children are in various stages of cancer treatment have come together in a special act of camaraderie.

At the annual 46 Mommas event inÂ Boston last week, 46 mothers shaved their heads in a public ceremony, raising more than $200,000 for the St Baldrick's Foundation, which funds pediatric cancer research.

'Every mom there is a cancer mom,' co-organizer Maisy Yeager - whose son Zarek was just eight when he was diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia - told Yahoo Health. 'So you can talk, and everyone will understand what you're talking about.'

In a moving photo from the ceremony, all of the moms pose together, smiling as they show off their newly-shaven heads.

Another picture shows Allison Smith, from Indiana, who holds up a photo of her son Jackson, a brain tumor survivor. The poster reads: '46 Mommas - Shave for the Brave, 2014 Boston'.

The event, which is held in a different U.S. city every year, aims not only to bring these moms together so they can share their mutual struggles and feelings, but also to raise awareness of the importance of pediatric cancer research.

The fact that exactly 46 mothers are involved is a symbol for the statistic that each weekday of the year, 46 mothers in the U.S. are told that their child has cancer.

'It's horrible, hearing the words "Your 
kid has cancer,"' said Ms Yeager, who works as a pharmaceutical biochemist in Massachusetts. 'It's unimaginable, the dread of loss 
you feel.'

'Once you do this crazy, powerful thing together, 
it's like, boom, we're sisters'

Fortunately for Ms Yeager, Zarek survived the disease thanks to years of steroid treatments and surgeries.

But for 2,000 mothers in American each year, their child is not so lucky. 'Some have suffered 
way more than others - some are what we call "angel moms,'" explained Ms
 Yeager. 'It's not a great description, but it's the best one out 
there.'

This year's 'angel moms' included Annmarie Kulikowski, who lost her three-year-old daughter Elizabeth to a brain tumor, and Bonny Neufeld, whose son Matthew passed away at age ten.

Amazingly, these women still continue to show their support for their fellow 'cancer moms', turning their tragedy into motivation to keep fighting for the cause.

Texas native Courtney Moore, another co-organizer, shaved her head this year for her 14-year-old daughter Georgia, who fought and conquered acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012.

'We're all these women from all across 
the country, as different as can be,' she said of the 46 Mommas event.

'But it's a sisterhood 
almost immediately. Once you do this crazy, powerful thing together, 
it's like, boom, we're sisters.'

And Leslie Jermainne, whose son Brian was diagnosed with Stage III Burkitt's Lymphoma at the age of 15, said she was surprised at the emotions she felt after having her head shaved.

Understanding each other: 'Every mom there is a cancer mom,' said co-organizer Maisy Yeager (pictured with her daughter Ana). 'So you can talk, and everyone will understand what you're talking about'

'I thought I was going to turn into an emotional wreck while my head was being shaved. But instead, I felt very free and happy and empowered,' she told the Shoreline Times.

'It was 
like taking control away from cancer. It was an amazing event and to 
meet so many other mothers who understand and have endured what I have 
was very healing.'

According to St Baldrick's Foundation CEO Kathleen Ruddy, the 46 Mommas team has raised more than $1.5million through pledged donations since it was founded.

'Since the team's inception in 2010, 
these brave women have provided hope to so many across the nation and 
around the world,' she said in a statement.

'We are so thankful for their incredible efforts and 
unwavering support of the St Baldrick's mission to conquer childhood 
cancers.'
