AFL player, Adelaide Crows forward Tom Lynch has suffered a neck fracture, which was detected four days after he suffered the injury during last weekend's clash with Brisbane Lions.

A statement from the Adelaide Crows confirms that 'after complaining of soreness and pain in his arm, Lynch was sent for an MRI scan (on Thursday). It revealed a fracture.'

Initial X-Rays and a CT scan had not shown any fractures or serious injury.

On Sunday August 10, Lynch was involved in what the Adelaide Crows are calling ‘a sickening collision’ in the second quarter of the match at The Gabba in Brisbane, Queensland. 

On game day, Lynch was stretchered off in a neck brace after making front-on contact with Brisbane defender Justin Clarke, but scans on the day indicated Lynch had escaped critical neck damage.

Tom Lynch and Charlie Cameron of the Crows celebrate a goal during the round 20 match last weekend, before Lynch was involved in a 'sickening clash' in the second quarter. Four days later, Lynch discovered he has a small neck fracture which early scans did not show.

Lynch was allowed to fly home with the team when cleared of any serious neck injury and the club had been referring to the injury as 'a jarred neck', until the discovery the injury was far worse.

Lynch, 23, was experiencing soreness and pain in his arm, the club confirms in their statement.

When the young player was not showing signs of recovery by Thursday and continued to experience ‘the occasional tingle in his fingertips’, doctors ordered further scans, concerned there was more to the neck injury, according to 3AW radio.

Dr Peter Larkins told 3AW radio that Lynch has fractured C7 and T1 vertebrae in his spine and expects he will be in a neck brace for six weeks.

The club confirms that Lynch will wear a neck brace, but for an unknown period of time. They emphasise that the brace is only a precautionary measure, to prevent further damage.

Although initial x-rays and a CT scan did not show any serious damage, Tom Lynch discoverd four days later that he has suffered a neck fracture. Lynch is pictured injured and being stretchered off in the Adelaide Crows Round 20 match against the Brisbane Lions on August 10.

Tom Lynch will wear a neck brace as a precautionary measure to avoid further injury. The Adelaide Crows forward has had terrible luck with injury this year, undergoing surgery for a broken jaw from a collision with Melbourne Demons' Jack Viney.

Fellow Adelaide Crows player, Patrick Dangerfield says the players were worried when the incident occurred but relieved to see their teammate was able to move his arms and legs, according to Adelaide Crows media.

Earlier this year, Lynch required surgery for a badly fractured jaw, suffered from a bump from Melbourne Demons midfielder Jack Viney.

Lynch was also recovering during the pre-season from foot surgery, only to dislocated his shoulder on the eve of the new season, when he had been finally deemed fit to play.

Coach Brenton Sanderson laments that the 23-year-old is having a 'horrific season injury-wise.'

Sanderson also defends Lynch, saying that although Lynch has received criticism for ducking his head when he came into contact with Clarke’s torso, Lynch was possibly trying to protect his jaw, considering the forward had suffered his broken jaw earlier in the year in a similar altercation.

Tom Lynch (right) was Adelaide's top goal scorer in 2013 and had already scored two goals against Brisbane Lions, before he was involved in the serious collision in the second quarter of the Round 20 match.

‘You have to remember  earlier in the year... he (Lynch) came out and lifted his head he got his jaw smashed in half. I think this time, instead of lifting his head up in the contest, Sanderson kept his head down,’ Sanderson told Adelaide Crows Football Club media.

Adelaide’s 2013 leading goalkicker had already kicked two goals before he was stretchered off.

Adelaide went on to secure a 105-point win over Brisbane.

Lynch sat out last night’s narrow loss to Richmond. At this stage it is unknown how long Lynch will be out with injury.
