He is arguably the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin after performing David Bowie’s Space Oddity on his guitar while he was more than 200 miles above the Earth.

To date, Commander Chris Hadfield’s video – shot in the International Space Station (ISS) – has had 25 million viewings on YouTube and even has the backing of the rock star himself, who declared it the most ‘poignant’ version of his hit.

But as if that wasn’t enough, the ISS commander’s fan base has gone stratospheric after he used his free time on board the floating laboratory to snap a series of stunning photographs of planet Earth and upload them to the world via a NASA link after taking personal requests from people around the globe.

The outcome was 45,000 captivating images – a number of Scotland, where his family are originally from – and a selection of which now feature in new book You Are Here: Around the World in 92 Minutes, the title taken from the length of time it takes for the ISS to make one orbit of the Earth.

Tomorrow, the 55-year-old Canadian astronaut, who retired last year, will touch down briefly in Edinburgh and Glasgow as part of a tour of book signings and entertaining presentations about his photographs and life among the stars.

He laughs as he admits he is as thrilled to be returning to Scotland as he was on his repeat visits to space. Seriously?

‘I love Scotland,’ he says, emphatically. ‘My grandmother’s family are from the Borders and I’ve been to Scotland many times over the years. In the 1820s, her family sent the eldest son to Canada, sort of like a space probe being launched today, to see how it was. He ended up in Montreal and never looked back. The rest, as they say, is history.’

He added: ‘It’s kind of funny that I ended up doing the same sort of thing, but to space, all these years later.’

His crystal-clear images of Skye, the Trossachs and the Clyde and Forth estuaries thrilled thousands in the UK when they were broadcast last year.

Former First Minister Alex Salmond was so taken with the photographs that he tweeted the astronaut his praise as well as inviting him to visit. From the ISS, Commander Hadfield, who now has 1.2 million followers on Twitter, replied: ‘I’d love to visit Scotland again once back on Earth. I’ve been from Oban to Aberdeen, but there’s so much more to see and do.’

On his way back from his last space mission in May last year, when his plane stopped off briefly in Scotland en route to the US, he tweeted again: ‘On the ground in Prestwick, to refuel. Blue sky day. Nature smiling on us. Was 1st here in 1977 – who could have predicted this?’

The astronaut believes his images have been such a phenomenal success because they strike a chord in the heart of everyone.

He said: ‘Everyone’s curious about how their part of the world looks from space and how it fits into everywhere else. It’s such an unusual and unique perspective to see the world that way.

‘So, while I was in orbit, I was emailing my son and it was his idea that I should take photographs of Earth. He suggested asking everyone down below for their ideas. 

'It had an immediate impact, with requests coming in from people asking me to take their part of the world. It wasn’t just some sort of narcissism. People genuinely wanted to see how it all looked.’

He added: ‘It was terrific fun but it took a bit of planning. I would wake up every morning in the space station, launch the laptop in my sleep pod and log on to Earth Map. 

'I’d scan through to see where we were going to be getting close to, then I’d check out the weather to see if it was cloudy or stormy and when that country was going to be in daylight.

‘If I thought it was going to work, I’d set the alarm to give myself a ten-minute warning. Sometimes, still wiping the sleep from my eyes or, if I was working on an experiment, suddenly my alarm would go off and I’d float over using the handrail, grab the camera and get the best position at the window after checking out the sun and the angle.

The ISS has a three dimensional bay window with enormous panes. They can get a bit smeared from people floating into them or looking out all the time. But I’d look for an unblemished spot on the glass and start taking pictures. Once I was finished, I put the memory card in my pocket, continued working and uploaded the images to a NASA link overnight.

‘I never actually saw many of the images I took, so that’s the reason for the book.’

Divided up by continent, the selected images in the book represent one orbit of the ISS and his planetary photo tour is punctuated with fun and fascinating commentary on life in zero gravity.

A presentation by him tomorrow at the Glasgow Science Centre is a sell-out, with all profits from the book going to the Red Cross.

His favourite moments in orbit, not surprisingly, came during space walks, where the jaw-dropping beauty of the galaxy made it difficult to concentrate on the sometimes menial tasks in hand.

He said: ‘I’ve spent 15 hours outside, with nothing between me and space except a spacesuit. There is nothing like that feeling of travelling through the universe with the Earth in the distance.

‘As humans, we get used to being on our planet, looking up to the universe. But actually being in the universe, looking down on the planet, is awe-inspiring.

‘There’s a visual allure in space that can make it hard to keep your mind on the job in hand because there are so many amazing things to see. 

The endless depths of space fill your thoughts and every time you are carrying out a task, you find yourself checking on the view.’ His vivid description conjures up images of the blockbuster Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts caught up in a catastrophic set of events in space. ‘Has he seen it?’ I ask.

Chris Hadfield was the first Canadian to walk in space. He recently returned from a five month-stint in on the International Space Station where he served as commander

The man who was the top graduate of the US Air Force Test Pilot School in 1988 and the US Navy test pilot of the year in 1991 before being hand-picked a year later by the Canadian Space Agency to be an astronaut laughs as he says: ‘Yes, I think I was the first astronaut to see Gravity. Of course, the storyline is pure Hollywood and you have to suspend your disbelief. 

'But visually it’s great. I think it captures that fundamental sense of the enormity, of space being around you and the Earth somewhere nearby.’

His music video, a zero-gravity version of Bowie’s song, received more than ten million views in its first three days online and had a profound effect on many who saw it – including its creator.

The astronaut said: ‘Bowie said it was the most poignant cover of his song. Why? I think it’s because it crosses over from fantasy to reality. For years, the whole “Ground control to Major Tom” thing was an idea. Then a spaceman made it actually happen.’

Former First Minister Alex Salmond was so taken with the photographs that he tweeted the astronaut his praise as well as inviting him to visit

He added: ‘Maybe it’s my Scottish ancestry but I’ve always been musical on a local pub level and I’ve got one of those brains that remembers all the lines. But I’d never covered Bowie before.

MY brother and I had recorded a Christmas carol which I performed from the ISS. My son Evan encouraged me to try Space Oddity and to begin with I only did it to humour him.

‘I’d no idea it would take off the way it did. I recorded vocals and guitar. Back on Earth, Evan organised the piano accompaniment and other instruments. It’s now been watched more than 25 million times, which is frankly incredible.’

He has no regrets about never returning to space now that he’s retired. ‘I’ve led a varied life and I don’t sit around thinking about it. I’m moving on to the next phase.

‘I might go back to school and learn about palaeontology or the human genome. Or trying to address the problems of climate change.’

It’s clear that the astronaut will never leave the man. For someone for whom the sky has never been a limit, he is still aiming high.
