Britain’s most notorious prisoner Charles Bronson ‘smeared himself in butter before taking on 12 prison guards’ after Arsenal won the FA Cup, it has emerged.

The 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur fan, who is branded Britain's most violent and dangerous prisoner, admitted he ‘had another rumble’ after the Premier League team beat Hull at Wembley.

Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap at Full Sutton Prison in York, covered himself in butter - supposedly making it harder for guards to restrain him – before going on the rampage on May 17.

In a letter to Kate Kray, the ex-wife of London gangster Ronnie Kray, written two days after the incident, Bronson revealed how he was left with broken ribs after the scuffle.

Excerpts from the letter, which was obtained by the Daily Mirror, revealed how he had ‘visions’ of Mrs Kray’s husband, who died in 1995, just before he flew into a rage because of the football result.

He wrote: ‘I so wanted Hull to win, coz (sic) I'm Spurs. I got Lurpak and spread it on thick. Then a small cloud appeared.

‘I swear I see Ron’s face. It was eerie. Go on son, let ’em have it!

‘I know the mind plays games in moments of mad events but it is still a comforting thought Ron’s still around.’

Bronson has spent the last 40 years in jail - save just four months and nine days between crimes - with 36 of those years spent in solitary confinement due to his 'aggression'.

He was first jailed in 1974, aged 22,
 for an armed robbery on a post office and his jail time has been 
repeatedly extended for various crimes including taking prisoners 
hostage.

Over the years, he has been involved in at least ten jail sieges and the outbursts have seen him moved 150 times.

He was given a life sentence in 1999 for holding a prison art teacher hostage for 44 hours for criticising some of his sketches.

CCTV footage showed him leading his victim around like a dog with a rope around his neck.

He once boasted: ‘I’ve had more hostages than Saddam Hussein’ and reportedly ate a budgie after he became annoyed by its singing.

The latest incident comes just months after he allegedly attacked a prison governor at Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes after his artwork was again criticised.

Bronson has become a prolific artist 
during his time inside and, controversially, his surreal multi-coloured 
drawings have sold for up to £1,000 and been displayed in galleries 
across London and the south east.

Mrs Kray, 58, from Kent, told the Mirror how Bronson was mortified to discover his mother Eira Peterson, 84, was upset by the alleged attack.

She told the newspaper: ‘He got put back in the cage and started drawing Easter bunnies instead of his usual disturbing pictures. But he is really upset that he’s upset his mum.

‘He said, “Can you put my drawings in auction to send my mum on holiday?”’

The
 prisoner, who was born Michael Gordon Peterson but changed his name in 
1989 - is due to go on trial for the alleged attack on September 1.

Despite
 the latest incidents, the muscle-bound convict - who is said to do 
2,000 push-ups a day – recently claimed his violent days ended more than
 a decade ago.

Charles Bronson's mother Eira Peterson, 84 (pictured), is said to have already been upset by another alleged attack at Woodhill Prison during which the inmate allegedly assaulted a governor
