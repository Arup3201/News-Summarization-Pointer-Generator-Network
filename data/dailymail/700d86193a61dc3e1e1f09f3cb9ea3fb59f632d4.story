Andy Murray will not be attending the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards on Sunday despite being hotly tipped to win.

The Wimbledon-winner has been training in Miami for three weeks and said the 11-hour flight back to Leeds would be too disruptive to his schedule.

Instead the tennis ace, who became the first man to win Wimbledon for 77 years this summer, will appear via satellite but he is keen for his non-attendance to not be seen as a snub.

Andy Murray is hotly tipped to win Sports Personality of the Year after becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years

Murray is warming up in Florida following back surgery in September and has only just started playing practice points as he tries to prepare for next month's Australian Open.

Speaking the The Guardian, Murray said: 'I have training and rehab every day up until Christmas Day. When I leave for a tournament, I'll be on the road for five months in total â€“ and training on Christmas Day.

If Murray wins the award he will not be the first sports star to miss out on collecting it in person.

In 2007 boxer Joe Calzaghe had to be handed his award by Lennox Lewis in Las Vegas after travelling to watch friend Ricky Hatton fight Floyd Mayweather.

Andrew Flintoff also missed out on collecting his prize in person in 2005 because he was in Pakistan with the England cricket team.

'I won't spend it with my family or girlfriend. I don't want to do it and, likewise, I'd like to be at the awards, but these are the sacrifices I need to make in order to give myself the best chance at the Australian Open in January.'

Murray, the world number four, added: 'I have a great relationship with the BBC, from the recent documentary to my regular columns throughout the year and I don't want this to be seen as a snub.

'I'm looking forward to linking up with the show live on the night and being part of it all.'

Sources close to Murray described it as 
'genuinely a tough decision for him, as he realises the importance of 
the Awards and what a huge 18 months he's had, and what it means to the 
British public.'

It is believed that Lendl cautioned against the trip as it would disrupt Murray acclimatising to the warmer weather.

Murray's friend Ross Hutchins is also training with him, as is outstanding British prospect Kyle Edmund, 18.

Murray's
first tournament of the new season will be an exhibition event in Abu 
Dhabi on Boxing Day against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, before the official ATP 
season opener in Qatar.

Murray was also awarded an OBE but almost missed that ceremony too after being randomly selected to complete a drugs test that morning

From there it is off to the Australian Open where current champion Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who ended last season by regaining the world number one ranking, will be waiting.

Murray has always viewed the training camp as an essential part of his training regime, and missed last year's ceremony in order to stay in the US, and was presented with the third place trophy next to the hotel swimming pool.

A BBC spokesperson said of Murray's absence: 'We are of course disappointed that Andy Murray cannot be in Leeds in person but are very much looking forward to him joining us live on the night via link-up.

'We're looking forward to a fantastic night celebrating the 60th Sports Personality, with many former winners and some of the world's biggest sport starts attending.'

The
last winner who did not attend the ceremony was Joe 
Calzaghe in 2007 who was in Las Vegas at the time and in 2005 Andrew 
Flintoff was unable to receive his award in person as he was on tour 
with the England cricket team in Pakistan.

This year's other nominees include cricketer Ian Bell, Welsh rugby international Leigh Halfpenny, track athlete Christine Ohuruogu and Paralympic sportswoman Hannah Cockroft.
