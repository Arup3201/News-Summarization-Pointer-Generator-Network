A veteran jockey from Texas is facing felony charges after being accused of cheating during a race by using an outlawed electrical device to 'buzz' the animal and make it run faster.

A criminal investigation was launched after a photograph of Roman Eric Chapa, 43, taken near the finish line at Sam Houston Race Park on January 17, was widely circulated through the racing community.

Chapa won the $50,000 race while riding Quiet Acceleration but he has now been charged with unlawful influence on racing.

He appeared in court before a judge at the Harris County Criminal Justice Center Friday morning.

Cheat? Roman Eric Chapa, 43, is charged with unlawful influence on racing. He went before a Houston judge. An investigation was launched after a photo allegedly shows Chapa holding an electrical shocking device

Caught? Race Park officials said the photograph was snapped by a man contracted to take photos of the races for promotional purposes

Photo finish: The photo (magnified to show detail) shot by Jack Coady, shows what officials say is jockey Roman Chapa, 43, using a banned device -  a small beige object in Chapa's left hand

Court records say the device seen in Chapa's hand delivers an electrical shock to the horse.

Suspicions were only aroused when the photographer told them Chapa asked for the photograph to be removed from a website but did not give him a specific reason as to why, only that 'it was a bad picture.'

Chapa denies using the device during the race and claimed the picture was photoshopped because 'someone was trying to frame him.'

Sam Houston Race Park President Andrea Young released a statement: 'We are pleased to see the swiftness with which the Texas Racing Commission, Texas Department of Public Safety and the Harris County District Attorney's office have moved in their investigation of Mr. Chapa's January 17th mount at Sam Houston Race Park. 

These sorts of actions have no place in our sport, and are a disservice to the tens of thousands of people involved in our sport who play by the rules every day. We will continue to support this investigation in every way possible.'

The owner of the horse said he was shaken and upset by allegations his animal was 'buzzed' with the device. 

Mr Pish insisted he had never seen anyone using a similar device in his three decades in the sport and was appalled to learn it appeared to have been used on his six-year-old horse.

The married father-of-one who runs a racing stable in rural Cibolo, just outside San Antonio, Texas, told Daily Mail Online: 'This has been really painful to me and my family. 

Shocking: The device, which officials say is similar to the one pictured, is designed to deliver a shock to the horse in order to cause it to accelerate

Upset: Trainer Danny Pish (right) said that he was shaken by the claims of abusing the horse he has raised since birth but added: 'We are in a country where it's innocent until proven guilty.'

'I'm the breeder, I've raised this horse and have had him his whole life.

'If this was used on him - and we are in a country where it's innocent until proven guilty - then it would be very upsetting to me.'

Roman Chapa, 43, of Big Spring has been charged with unlawful influence on racing after being allegedly caught in the act of using the device in a photo taken near the finish line. 

The jockey was running in fifth place in the $50,000 Richard King Stakes at Sam Houston Race Park on January 17 when his mount, Quiet Acceleration, pressed to the front of the pack and won by half a length.

Track photographer Jack Coady snapped a photo of Chapa just before the finish of the $50,000 race, which Quiet Acceleration had entered at 10-to-1 odds.

According to the Paulick Report, the photo accompanied a write-up on the track's website about the day's races.

The day after the race, according to a probable cause complaint, Chapa contacted Coady, telling him to take the photo down from the website because 'it was a bad picture.'

After being confronted by Texas Department of Public Safety investigator Jeff Green, Chapa first denied having seen the photo, then claimed it was 'photo-shopped and someone was trying to frame him,' the complaint stated.

Two days after the race, Texas Racing Commission stewards suspended Chapa, pending an investigation and hearing.  

Chapa faces a felony charge and that a warrant was issued for his arrest on Tuesday, but authorities have so far been unable to locate him. 

There does not appear to be a direct precedent for prosecution of a jockey over use of such a device. 

The horse has earned career winnings of $200,000 Mr Pish said. Mr Pish is a trainer, but has also bred some horses for racing, including Quiet Acceleration. 

'He's done well in the past. Of the limited number of horses I've raised as a breeder, he's the best one,' Mr Pish said.

'He's had nine lifetime victories, ten if you include the race in question.

'I don't know how this device works because I know nothing about it. I know they are commonly used in dog training but they are not legal in horse training.

'It's illegal and I would never condone any illegal activity.

'I had no idea about any of this until the photo came out. I felt total disbelief, I just can't believe it's true.

'I've checked him out. His health seems to be good and I don't see any after-effects.'

Chapa, 43, is one of a number of jockeys who have ridden Quiet Acceleration to victory, helping the mount amass winnings in excess of $200,000.

Mr Pish said: 'Jockeys are free agents. They jump from horse to horse.

'They have an agent and I let him know about possible races and that I'm interested in a jockey.

'I have limited control other than giving suggestions as to how the horse may be ridden.

'Mr Chapa has ridden the horse in the past and he's won on him before. I was aware of his one prior conviction but I never dreamed he would do something like this.

'This sort of thing is not seen as acceptable within horse racing. If he's found guilty he should be punished.' 

Training ground: The horse's trainer is Dan Pish, who is based at these stables just outside San Antonio, Texas

In addition to the felony charge, Chapa faces the probability that the Texas Racing Commission will take way his license to race.

He has a checkered history as a jockey and has been suspended twice before for buzzing horses.

Chapa was sanctioned by Texas officials in 1994 for using a nail to spur his horse, Silver Sixes, at a qualifying race at the Gillespie County Fair. He was suspended from racing for nine months and fined $2,500, though at the time he was still an apprentice.

New Mexico racing officials suspended him for five years after he was reportedly caught using an electrical device back in 2007.

Chapa was also suspected of using a prohibited device after a Peta investigation in 2014 caught assistant trainer Scott Blasi on tape talking about the jockey using an electric buzzer.

'That silly-a-- Roman Chapa put it in his mouth in New Mexico,' Blasi was heard saying to jockey Gary Stevens and trainer D. Wayne Lukas. 

'They came in to shake him down, he stuck it in his mouth, then he spit it out in his wash bucket,' Blasi added. 

Chapa also received a sentence of 10 days in 2002 for a plea deal on cruelty to animals charges, after police said Chapa 'tortured an animal by beating it with a strap'.
