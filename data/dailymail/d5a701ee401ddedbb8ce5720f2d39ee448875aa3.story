HE is a cold-blooded assassin who has been waiting in the shadows since vanishing more than five years ago.

But now Agent 47 has returned. His motive? Revenge. A dish best served cold and he's been fine-tuning his recipe.

Hounded by the police, 47 finds himself in the middle of a dark conspiracy. He must embark on a journey through a corrupt and twisted world, in his quest for the truth.

Hidden warrior: Agent 47 carefully lines up his target from an apartment window

What the Hitman franchise does is deliver choice. You could walk up in the street and blast the target. Take him out from distance. Or, in true silent assassin fashion, set up certain booby traps and make the guy's death look like an accident.

Hitman: Blood Money was brilliant, but Absolution will be worth the wait. It has been built from the ground up, boasting a cinematic story, distinctive art direction and highly original game design.

It combines much-loved classic gameplay with completely new features for the franchise. The Glacier 2 engine is a remarkable piece of precise engineering - squeezing the last drop of power from the aging consoles and providing a visual tour-de-force on high-end PCs.

Everything has a sort of ‘Hollywood sheen’. From the dank, dark suburbs teeming with intricate details, to the vast, sun-kissed vistas which stretch draw distance to its limit.

The man himself is brilliantly detailed, too – his wrinkles and realistic skin are a far cry from the slightly cartoon-like 47 of the past.

Wonderful animations enforce the idea that 47 is a living, breathing man, who although skilled – is not quite invincible.

Hit in the making: If being quiet is not your thing, you can run in all guns blazing

Absolution has much more depth than before. One addition is ‘instinct mode’. This will let 47 predict enemy patrols – think Batman: Arkham Asylum spliced with Splinter Cell: Conviction.

This is optional so it won’t dictate the way you play. However, similar to Splinter Cell, if things get too hectic, you’ll be able to mark and slow-motion execute targets.

This is a refreshing move as ‘open’ combat in the previous Hitman games wasn’t quite as solid as it should have been.

In Blood Money, it was almost impossible to avoid the tendency to restart the level if a hit went wrong.

The player was often swarmed by (not-too-bright) AI guards who would bound gleefully into the path of a rapid-firing machine gun – resulting in a mini massacre.

Absolution also has a lovely touch, where, if you get too close to an enemy, the camera slows down – and you’ll see the guy double-take you.

Tense moments: Agent 47 must slip past these cops

They also have memory, so don’t expect to take a guy out when someone’s back is turned, for them to turn around and not realise ‘that engineer’ now looks nothing like the guy who was there a second ago.

Surprisingly, the developer has said that only 20 per cent of Absolution's players will see the game's ending.

Speaking to Official Playstation Magazine, Tore Blystad, game director for IO Interactive, said: 'We are using metrics a lot more now than we did, for good and for 
bad. The general player will probably never even finish the game, which 
is very sad. Or they might only play through it once.

'But the game is 
built for the people who want to go back through every single level and 
get all the stuff out of it. It’s built to last, rather than be a 
one-off experience.'

He added: ‘(Absolution) is both a familiar and yet significantly different experience to any of the other Hitman games, something our silent assassins will relish as well as those who are new to the Hitman world.’
