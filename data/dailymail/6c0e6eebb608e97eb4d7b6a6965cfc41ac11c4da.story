These dramatic photos capture a herd of elephants as they charge towards the Tarangire River in Tanzania during their seasonal migration - chasing away hundreds of buffalo cooling off in the shallow water.

Israeli zoologist Michal Samuni-Blank photographed the majestic elephants as they approached the river, where roughly 500 buffalo were escaping from the parched African heat.

The herd of roughly 25 elephants - both adults and calves - can be seen sloping down a grassy hill before breaking into a run as they get closer to the water - a scarce resource during the dry season.

Watering hole: Israeli zoologist Michal Samuni-Blank first captured roughly 500 buffaloes as they cooled off in the shallow water of the Tarangire River in Tanzania

Migration: The zoologist photographs the herd of thirsty elephants - roughly 25 adults and calves - as they make their way towards the water

Charge: The elephants, pictured in the foreground of the image, picked up speed as they approached the water, ready to chase away the lingering buffaloes

Startled: At the sight of the elephants, some of the buffaloes start to leave the shallow water and climb up the grassy hill on the other side of the river, pictured right

The elephants are then captured driving away the buffalo - who flee the watering hole at the sight of the stampeding herd.

The chase is made more dramatic by the cloud of dust that is kicked up by the animals as they charge over the parched African ground.

After chasing away lingering buffalo from the river bank in a dramatic pursuit, the elephants are left to relax in the water - where they are photographed frolicking and playing happily.  

But Dr Samuni-Blank, who watched the scene from 500 metres away at the Tarangire Safari Lodge, said that there was no physical contact between the two species. 

The zoologist, who is now based in New York, said: 'An elephant family - both adults and calves - approached the Tarangire river after a long journey. They started running towards the water when it came into sight. 

'Elephants are herbivores, but they are very protective of their young calves, so they started chasing away a huge herd of buffaloes. 

Round up: The elephants break through the herd of buffalo standing in the river, before continuing up the grassy bank on the other side

Protective: More elephants from the herd join in chasing the buffaloes. Dr Samuni-Bank explained that the usually docile animals would have been protecting their calves

Force: Ears flapping in the wind, the elephants can be seen running faster as they drive the lingering buffalo from the water- a scare resource during the dry season

Drama: Dust is kicked up by the animals as the chase intensifies. Dr Samuni-Bank described the experience as 'watching the National Geographic Channel in real life'

'The buffaloes fled the scene, running up the hill, away from the river. When all the buffaloes have left the river, the elephants started drinking and playing in the water. 

'The dust that the animals kicked up added mystery and excitement to the scene.'

During the dry season in September, water resources for animals, like elephants, are very limited. It forces the animals to go on long journeys through the scrub in search of something to drink.

Dr Samuni-Bank continued: 'The reaction I get is unbelievable and generally people can't believe I saw this. 

'They say it is like watching the National Geographic Channel in real life.

'I was thrilled to witness this, it was a very powerful moment and I appreciated every second of it.

'Elephants are highly intelligent animals and are usually very gentle with other creatures.

'Even though the elephants chased away the buffaloes they didn't physically attack any of them - throughout the chase there was no physical contact between the two species.'

Elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food, water and mates, and typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores, which will usually stay out their way.
