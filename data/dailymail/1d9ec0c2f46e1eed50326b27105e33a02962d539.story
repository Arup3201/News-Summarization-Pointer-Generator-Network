Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd resigned on Wednesday, saying he could no longer work with Prime Minister Julia Gillard, amid speculation he would mount a leadership challenge and plunging the government into a new crisis.                

Ms Gillard ousted Mr Rudd as prime minister in June 2010 and there has been ongoing tension in the Labor Party in recent weeks over the leadership.

He made the announcement at a press conference in Washington DC, where he had earlier met US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton.

Refusal: Julia Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd as prime minister in June 2010 and there has been ongoing tension in the Labor Party in recent weeks over the leadership

Announcement: Mr Rudd declared his resignation at a press conference in Washington DC, saying he could not continue without Ms Gillard's support

A recent poll shows Mr Rudd is preferred as prime minister by 57 per cent of voters compared with 35 per cent for Ms Gillard.

In October, Mr Rudd led by 61 per cent to 30 per cent.

About one-quarter of those who back Mr Rudd do not believe he should run for the leadership.

'The simple truth is that I cannot continue to serve as foreign minister if I don't have Prime Minister Gillard's support,' he said.

'I therefore believe the only honourable course of action is for me to resign.'

He said he would not be involved in a 'stealth attack on a sitting prime minister'.

'We all know that what happened then was wrong and it must never happen again,' he said, referring to how he was ousted.

The pair differed little on policy, but 
their battle threatens to lead to an early election and a defeat for its
economic reform agenda.

Rudd's supporters have called on 
Gillard to hold a leadership ballot, believing only he can stem 
haemorrhaging voter support, but a move back to Rudd risks losing the 
backing of independents who give the minority Labor government a 
one-seat majority.           

'If
they go down this stream it is a very high risk strategy and it would 
more than likely lead to an early election,' said Tony Windsor, one of 
the independents.       

Rudd
told a news conference in Washington he would return to Australia this 
week before deciding his future, but ended his announcement asking his 
ruling Labor party colleagues 'who is best placed to defeat (opposition 
leader) Tony Abbott at the next election?'.       

The
latest leadership turmoil has been fuelled by an ongoing poll slump, 
with Rudd's backers saying he remains more popular with voters and would
help revive party support ahead of the next election, due in late 
2013.

But while Rudd is more popular with voters, he is not as well liked within the Labor Party and he alienated may colleagues with imperious style when he was prime minister.              

Labor insiders say Gillard has the strong support of the ruling Labor Party, with Rudd supporters numbering around 30 of the 103 Labor Party lawmakers.             

Earlier, Gillard was reportedly considering sacking Rudd from the ministry in order to reassert her authority over the government.                

While Rudd would be unlikely to win a leadership vote, any surprise Rudd victory could force a snap election as he would need to re-negotiate support from the Greens and independents.    

Opposition leader Abbott has vowed to scrap the government's proposed taxes on carbon emissions and mining profits if he wins the next election.

Senior government ministers have in the past week urged Gillard to sack Rudd from the ministry due to the bitter and ongoing speculation that he wants to return as prime minister.       

'The simple truth is I cannot continue to serve as foreign minister if I do not have Prime Minister Gillard's support,' Rudd said. 'The only honourable course of action is for me to resign.'           

Weeks of leadership instability now undermines Labor's chances of holding power in the state of Queensland at a March 24 poll - the resource-rich state is also crucial for the national government's re-election.             

The Gillard government would be thrown from office if a general election was held now. Australia's next national election is due in 2013. 

Meanwhile gay marriage was the topic of table conversation when Prime Minister Julia Gillard, an opponent of  same sex-marriage, hosted a dinner for three gay couples at her official residence.

An Australian activist group won a charity auction and the guests used the three-course meal in the national capital of Canberra to lobby the prime minister to allow gay marriage.

Although Gillard’s Labor Party lifted its long-standing opposition to same-sex marriage in December, she remains against changing the law.
