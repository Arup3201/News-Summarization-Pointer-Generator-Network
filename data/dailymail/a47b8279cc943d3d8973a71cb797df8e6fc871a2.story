These two unidentified men are believed to have attempted to buy a woman's boy for $100 at a California supermarket

She refused the bizarre request, but he continued telling the boy he was very beautiful, NBC Los Angeles reports.

The woman tried to wait in the store's lobby until the man was gone and she believed it was safe to go, but upon heading to her car he drove over in a champagne-colored Honda Pilot.

Another unidentified man was in the passenger seat.

''Oh look, it’s you! It’s both of you. You’re so beautiful,'' she told police he complimented her again.

She demanded they leave her alone, but the man who complimented her got out of the vehicle, pulled a $100 out and asked to purchase the boy.
