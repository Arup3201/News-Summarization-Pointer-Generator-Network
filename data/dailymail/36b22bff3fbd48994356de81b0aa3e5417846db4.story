He’s certainly not the type of man you would expect to simply ignore somebody who left him angry.

And when Jeremy Clarkson had his Twitter account hacked yesterday morning by someone giving his 1.3million followers a link to ‘the fastest way to lose body fat in two weeks’, he vowed to take revenge.

The 52-year-old BBC Top Gear host said seven hours later: ‘I have been hacked by spammers. Luckily I have acquired a special set of skills over many years. I will find them. And I will kill them.’

Getting his own back: After Jeremy Clarkson had his Twitter account hacked by someone promising his 1.3million followers 'the fastest way to lose body fat in two weeks', he has vowed to take revenge

A tweet was first posted by hackers at 11:13am yesterday with a link to a website, but it was simply one of many scams which claim you can lose miraculous amounts of weight by eating acai berries.

Clarkson later responded with a tweet at 6:18pm to say he would find the hackers, and then another at 11:41pm, saying: ‘Unlike some people, I will find who hacked my account. And I will visit them.’

His first tweet was paraphrasing a quote from the 2008 thriller Taken, when Liam Neeson, who plays an ex-CIA agent trying to save his daughter,  says: 'I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.'.

Security journalist Graham Cluley said Clarkson probably 'either 
had his password phished, guessed or cracked, or granted a rogue
third party application rights to post from his account'.

He gave this advice on the Sophos Naked Security blog: 'Clarkson should change his password and revoke the rights of any application connected to his Twitter account that he doesn't recognise.'

Not happy: Clarkson also said on Twitter yesterday that he would 'find who hacked my account' and 'visit them'

It came on the same day that fast food 
chain Burger King found its Twitter account, which now has more than 
110,000 followers - up from 80,000 yesterday - had been hacked by a 
McDonald’s fan.

The branding of their page was changed to feature their rival’s food - and even their logo and name were changed, appearing as McDonalds @BurgerKing. But it has since changed back to normal.

A tweet at 2:59am today on the page, which has been recaptured by the company, said: ‘Interesting day here at Burger King, but we're back. Welcome to our new followers. Hope you all stick around.’
