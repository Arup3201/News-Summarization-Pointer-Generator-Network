Is this the new iPhone cable? This image purporting to show the new gadget's lead was leaked on Twitter by Veister, a charger making company

An Apple supplier has fuelled rumours that the release of the new iPhone is imminent by announcing it has begun mass production of a new, thinner display for a mystery customer.

Flat-screen maker LG Display said production of the screens, widely speculated for use in the next incarnation of Apple's iconic smartphone, remains in line with customers' product release plans.

'We just began mass production and we don't expect any disruption in supplies,' Han Sang-beom, chief executive of LG Display, a panel supplier for Apple products, told reporters in South Korea last night.

Mr Han made no mention of who the customer could be. His announcement came as a photo apparently showing a charge and sync cable for the new iPhone emerged online.

Apple is planning a major product launch on September 12, stoking speculation that the world's most valuable technology company will unveil its eagerly awaited redesigned iPhone.

The company is rumoured to be equipping the next iPhone with a larger screen after Samsung Electronics unveiled its latest Galaxy smartphone with a 4.8-inch touch-screen.

Sources have said that the panels for the new iPhone will be 4in corner to corner - 30 per cent bigger than current iPhones.

The iPhone screens will also be 
thinner than previous versions with the use of so-called in-cell panels 
which embed touch sensors into the liquid crystal display, eliminating 
the touch-screen layer found in current iPhones.

However, The Register reports that 
pundits have speculated that the revolutionary new design could lead to 
shortages, because the displays are harder to make.

The new iPhone 5? These images purport to show the new version of Apple's popular smartphone

Earlier this week a phone company 
leaked what it claimed is the official front cover of Apple's 
soon-to-be-released upgrade to its iPhone range, which appears to 
confirm a larger screen for the bestseller.

Phone repair shop UBreakIFix.com released two images of the 'iPhone 5'.

It follows rumours that the next 
iPhone will be thinner than ever, with a thickness of 7.6mm, making it 
two millimetres thinner than the iPhone 4S.

LG's announcement came as a single 
photo purporting to show a charge and sync cable for the next-generation
iPhone appeared on social messaging site Twitter.

The cable appears to be similar to 
previous iPhone cables, except of course that at one end is the 
notorious new smaller dock connector which will, at a stroke, make all 
previous iPhone accessories obsolete.

Well-informed sources have noted that 
the length of the cable is different to the standard length of previous 
Apple iPhone cables, prompting speculation that this is actually a third
party cable.

The image was posted by Shenzen Veister Tech, a Chinese maker of mobile phone accessories.

It is believed the iPhone 5 will be 
announced on September 12, with pre-orders opening immediately. The 
phone itself is expected to launch just over a week later on September 
21.

However, Apple fans in the UK may have to wait another two weeks until October 5 before getting their hands on a phone.

Apple are notoriously secretive and 
have not even revealed what they will call their next iPhone. It could 
be 'iPhone 5', or it may follow this year's spring iPad launch and 
simply be called 'the new iPhone'.

Last week, more component pictures 
appeared to confirm the controversial new 'dock connector', the power 
and data port which has been redesigned - leaving older charger cables 
and docks useless without adapters.

Change: This picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new iPhone, with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete

The photograph, shared by French tech 
website nowhereelse.fr, shows two components, one of which is said to be
similar to another apparently leaked picture of a part of the new 
iPhone.

As well as the new dock connector, the
part also seems to take in the headphone jack and the home button 
connector for the hotly awaited devices.

There was an outcry when it was revealed that the next iPhone would get a new docking port connector.

The newer, slimline port means that 
thousands of current Apple accessories will need a potentially clunky 
adapter to work with the 'iPhone 5' - or their devices will become 
unusable.

Leaks from the website iMore, which 
has strong sources 'close to Apple', earlier this month suggested the 
entire next generation of iDevices, including the iPod Nano, iPod Touch,
iPad Mini and future versions of the iPad, will use the new port.

The site believes a special connector 
will be released to connect older accessories - such as docking stations
and speakers - to newer versions of the range.

The 'nano-SIM' slot, containing the 
SIM card which connects a phone to the carrier network, has also been 
redesigned to be thinner, although this will be unlikely to cause much 
disruption to users as networks will provide replacements SIMs if 
necessary.
