A pair of EMTs just wanted a dinner break at Applebee's but their portable carbon monoxide detectors started going off before they could even take a seat.

Justin Gau and Kyle Page said they couldn't believe the sensors had picked up anything.

'I
 made Justin go outside once or twice to reset it to make sure it was 
functioning before we screwed up everyone's evening,' Page told ABC 7.

About 100 patrons and employees were evacuated from this Long Island Applebee's when a toxic gas was discovered

EMTs Justin Gau and Kyle Page said their carbon monoxide detector went off upon entering the restaurant

Once they knew the equipment was in order, they began an evacuation.

About 100 patrons and employees were sent out of the restaurant.

Though a few did report feeling ill, none accepted medical treatment.

The leak was tracked back to a faulty water heater, forcing CO levels far above normal.

While homes with gas stoves can register 15 ppm or .05 to 5 ppm for homes without a gas stove, the Applebee's was registering 80 to 250 ppm.

That's high enough to be fatal.

The EMTs portable detector warned the about the gas

The restaurant did not have a CO detector, and the gas is colorless, odorless, and tasteless.

'After they closed up, they shut down the ventilation system and the 
CO could have been pumping in there all night and whoever opened in the 
morning could have been a bad turn out,' Page told reporters.

The building was ventilated and the heater shut off.
