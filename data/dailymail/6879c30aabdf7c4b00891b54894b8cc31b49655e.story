Detectives found high levels of the poison in the man's blood after he was admitted to Leeds General Infirmary.

Detective Chief Inspector Lisa Atkinson, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Officers are currently conducting enquiries around the supplier of these tablets and that work is ongoing. 

'We have recovered a number of the tablets and they have been sent for forensic analysis which will take some weeks to complete.

'Based on what the man involved has told u,s we suspect the tablets may have been the source of the arsenic he has consumed.

'On that basis we are making people aware of the potential risk to their health of consuming similar tablets bought on the internet.

'While it is expected that he will make a full recovery we are told this is unusual for the level of arsenic in his system and that consequences could have been far more serious.'

Experts have, in the past, warned of the dangers of buying medicines over the internet, including erectile dysfunction drugs.

Many sites are known to sell fake, sub-standard or even dangerous medicines. 

More than £10 million is thought to be spent online by more than 300,000 men in the UK, believing they are buying the erectile dysfunction drug, Viagra.

An estimated two million Britons regularly buy medicines, including prescription drugs and those not available on the NHS, over the internet for a range of conditions.

Drugs companies have warned of the dangers of buying Viagra, pictured, and other erectile dysfunction remedies on the internet,  with some counterfeit medicines containing blue printer ink, toxic ingredients and powerful antibiotics that can cause an allergic reaction, diarrhoea or vomiting

The pharmaceutical company Pfizer, who manufacture Viagra, warns on its website of the dangers of buying counterfeit medications.

It warns that fake Viagra has been found to contain blue printer ink, amphetamines or speed, and a powerful antibiotic that can cause an allergic reaction, diarrohea or vomiting. 

In addition, too much of the active ingredient has been found in some fake drugs, causing potential harm, and binding agents including drywall that prevent the tablet breaking down in the body. 

Other counterfeit medication that claims to help combat erectile dysfunction has been found to contain toxic ingredients including boric acid, floor wax, brick dust and road paint.

Traces of ingredients that can have dangerous interaction with other medications people may be taking have also been found, as well as completely different medication with potentially harmful side effects.
