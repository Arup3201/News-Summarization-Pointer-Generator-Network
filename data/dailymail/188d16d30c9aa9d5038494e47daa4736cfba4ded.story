An 85-year-old woman was lucky to escape with her life after taking a wrong turn and driving 50 yards along a busy railway line.

The pensioner is thought to have been driving her 20-year-old grandson to the station when she became confused at a level crossing.

Instead of driving her silver Renault Clio straight over the lines on the A337 through Brockenhurst, New Forest, Hants, she turned onto the tracks.

It is thought she then panicked and drove along the commuter line towards Brockenhurst train station before finally stopping.

British Transport Police as well as Hampshire Police were scrambled to the scene at 9.35am yesterday morning.

Officers climbed onto the tracks to lift the distraught woman and her passenger to safety. Both were uninjured.

The busy rail route, a main line between Bournemouth, Dorset, and London Waterloo, had to be closed for nearly two hours while the car was lifted off the tracks by a crane.

Onlookers said the pair were lucky to escape with their lives.

Alex Capozza, from Bournemouth, Dorset, saw the car on the London-bound tracks as he turned up for work at the nearby Il Palio Restaurant.

Mr Capozza, 30, said: 'They are very lucky they were not hurt - the route is very busy at that time of the morning.

'There are trains every 30 minutes and the express train from Bournemouth to London which doesn't stop.

'Thankfully the signal box is quite close to where the woman stopped so they must have quickly raised the alarm.

'I saw the elderly lady in the car - she looked shaken. There was a police officer with her, trying to calm her down.

'Eventually they managed to carry her out. There were about 15 police there in total - standing between the crossing and the station.

'When I saw it, I just couldn't believe there was a car on the tracks.

'I've no idea how it happened, how she could have driven down the railway line so far without stopping.

'Surely you would realise you'd gone through the crossing the wrong way - it's pretty obvious.'

Mr Capozza continued: 'I've never heard of anything like this happening here before. It was a bit amusing.

'Thankfully neither of them were hurt. I think the lady was taken away in a taxi - I don't think she'll be getting back in a car again. The car couldn't simply be reversed off the tracks - it had to be lifted off with a crane.'

Helping hand: A crane is called in to move the Renault

A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'BTP and Hampshire Police officers attended the line, around 80 yards from Brockenhurst rail station, after a report a car had driven onto the line from the level crossing.

'The incident was reported to police at 9.35am.

'Paramedics from the South Central Ambulance Service also attended. An 85-year-old woman driver and 20-year-old man in the car at the time have been treated for shock, but no other injuries have been reported.

'The vehicle, a silver Renault Clio, was removed from the track by recovery vehicles, and normal train services resumed at 11.18am.'
