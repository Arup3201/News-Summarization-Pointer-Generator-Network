A growing number of schools are ditching traditional Christian assemblies in favour of reflections on topics such as iPhones, Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder, a Mail on Sunday investigation has found.

Up to 270 primary and secondary schools have been allowed to opt out of the legal requirement to provide a daily act of ‘broadly Christian’ collective worship – up from about 230 five years ago.

Documents obtained from local authorities under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws show that one secondary school, Acton High School in Ealing, included the ‘birth of the iPhone’, to highlight ‘communications’.

Traditionalists attacked the trend for robbing children of their understanding of a vital element of Britain’s heritage.

Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is the birthright of children in this country to become familiar with its identity – including its religious identity – which is, broadly speaking, Christian.

‘Moving from the nativity  of Christ to the nativity of  the iPhone shows the extent to which assemblies have become degraded.’

But Acton High School head Andy 
Sievewright said only a quarter of his pupils were from a Christian 
background, so the school did not have ‘a specifically Christian focus’.

Another Ealing school, Featherstone 
High, last year used assemblies to mark International DayAgainst 
Homophobia and International Women’s Day, highlighting figures such as 
US First Lady Michelle Obama and television host Oprah Winfrey.

Head Gerry Wadwa said only about seven per cent of  his pupils saw themselves as Christians. He added: ‘Our assemblies provide time and space for a reflection on a range of spiritual, moral, social and cultural issues.’

One school in North London, Norbury Primary, gave an example of an assembly during which the lyrics of the Stevie Wonder song Happy Birthday were explored.

A council spokesman said the song had been chosen for Martin Luther King Day because it had been composed to mark his birthday.

Schools have had to provide a daily act of Christian worship since the 1944 Education Act. But they can apply for an exemption to the local authority’s Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education, made up of school and faith representatives.

Most of the schools which apply have a large number of ethnic minority pupils, and in  a few cases parents have threatened to withdraw their children from Christian- based worship.

All 152 English councils were sent FOI requests, of which 110 said a total of 195 schools had opted out – which would be nearly 270 if extrapolated across the country.

Colin Hart, director of the Christian Institute, said that  in an attempt not to ‘upset anyone’, children were receiving an ‘appalling mishmash’ at assemblies.

He said: ‘You hear some of the things that children do in collective worship, such as  I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles being sung in primary school, and you have to ask, where is the relevance?’

But councillor Susan Hall, leader of Harrow Council, said: ‘A school assembly can tackle ethical issues without religious context, and examples or issues from the everyday world can be  used to make serious  points about morality  and society.’
