Accused: Dr Hal Hill, 52, is said to have put the toxic heavy metal into his wife's morning coffee

A respected Tennessee doctor who was nominated for a national award has been accused of poisoning his wife for at least five months by putting Barium into her morning cup of coffee without her knowledge.

Dr Hal Hill, 52, is said to have put the toxic heavy metal into wife Liesa’s beverage which he brought her in bed every morning in what seemed to be a tender, loving gesture.

In fact each drink was causing her to have stomach problems and feel lethargic, court documents allege.

Mrs Hill’s torture came to an end when she supposedly saw him doing it and secretly took a sample which she gave to police.

She was shocked when tests showed it contained a high level of Barium - which is used in mouse poison and can be fatal.

When Mrs Hill stopped drinking her morning coffee her condition mysteriously improved, and police told her her previous symptoms were consistent with Barium poisoning.

She has now filed an emergency order of petition against her husband and won temporary custody of their two children, aged 12 and 11.

The astonishing case suggests that behind the couple’s apparently happy marriage of 14 years and Dr Hill’s good standing in the community lay a dark desire to harm his wife.

Secret: Each drink caused Liesa to have stomach problems and feel lethargic, court documents allege

Dr Hill is a respected expert in infectious diseases in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and works at Memorial Hospital in Hutcheson and another medical centre nearby.

He has no record of disciplinary action against him and in March was nominated by the Hamilton

County Medical Society as a top local physician for National Doctor's Day.

His wife first noticed she was ill last year and according to the Times Free Press actually turned to her husband for treatment on what could be the problem.

But in the court petition she said that everything changed in March this year when ‘I found my husband putting an unidentified substance in my coffee, as he usually prepared my morning coffee for me’.

Mrs Hill's attorney Chrissy Mincy said that in the following months she lived a horrific ‘game of chess’ in which she inspected every piece of food or drink in the house before trying it.

 Devastating: Barium is used in mouse poison and can be fatal or lead to paralysis

Each day she would take a sample of the coffee and secretly gave it to officers who carried out more tests.

She also had to live with the fear she was being paranoid - or that her husband had actually be poisoning her.

Ms Mincy said: ‘She followed her instincts. I'm so glad she's able to be in the house by herself now. Because she went through hell.

Barium is a radioactive chemical with the symbol Ba and the atomic number 56.

The heavy metal occurs naturally in the environment and is silvery white in appearance.

Its most well known use is as Barium Sulfate in a contrasting agent in X-rays - the patient swallows a liquid containing a low dose and it shows up on the scan.

It is also used in mouse poison, as an alloy for spark plugs, steel deoxidisers and rubber products. Some light bulb coatings contain barium oxide.

Barium cannot be digested by the body so will cause poisoning if ingested, especially as it reacts when it comes into contact with water.

Those who work with the chemical are advised to wear flame resistant rubber clothes and a gas mask.

If somebody is poisoned with Barium they are advised to force themselves to throw up to get it out of their system, and go immediately to the emergency room.

Symptoms can include stomach problems, brain swelling, weak muscles and damage to the liver and kidneys.

It can also cause cancer and the effects of ingestion can last for a year.

‘This weekend she finally got a good night's sleep for the first time in months.’

She added that it ‘doesn’t seem like much of a coincidence’ that Mrs Hill’s condition improved the day she started drinking her coffee.

‘Before the results, everything was so incredible. Because it is hard to believe, it really is’.

Barium is normally used in the medical or chemical industry and is put into fireworks and matches.

It is also used in stomach X-rays as a contrasting agent.

Some kinds are absorbed into the body but it can be fatal if too much is consumed.

It also affects the nervous system 
and cause heart problems and paralysis, but is hard to come by and the 
poisoner may have got it from a nuclear pharmacy, which is not open to 
the public.

John 
Benitez, managing director of the Tennessee Poison Centre, said: 
‘Essentially what they (Barium molecules) do is they block one of the 
chemicals in our body that is used for nervous tissue and for 
maintaining control of heart rhythm called potassium’.

No
 criminal charges have been filed in the case and police admit they 
cannot say for sure who put the Barium in Mrs Hill’s drink.

The petition states that Dr Hill can 
only go back to the family home in Lookout Mountain if his wife’s lawyer
 and police are present.

Police have also searched the $350,000 property and come out with a number of bags marked ‘evidence’.

Rae
 Young Bond, executive director of the Chattanooga and Hamilton County 
Medical Society, which oversees Dr Hill’s license to practice, said its 
procedure was to wait until legal matters were resolved before taking 
action.

He said: ‘The Medical Society takes this matter very seriously and has a process to review the membership status of a member physician who has been convicted of a felony or found guilty of unprofessional conduct that brings the medical profession into disrepute.

The case of apparent spousal poisoning has already drawn parallels with ‘Milkshake murderer’ Nancy Kissel who drugged her husband with a milkshake laced with sedatives then battered him to death.

It has also been compared to that of ‘Black Widow’ Stacey Castor who poisoned her husband David with antifreeze.

A judge will review the order of protection and temporary custody order on August 14.

Dr Hill did not respond to requests for comment from local media.

Mrs Hill declined to comment.
