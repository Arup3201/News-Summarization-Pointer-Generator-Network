A woman who alleged she was raped at a party by four men, including two college football players in 1998, has discovered that all of the evidence in the case has been destroyed.

Brenda Tracy had not been named publicly until recently when she told her story to Oregonian sports columnist John Canzano.

But during a meeting with the president of Oregon State University she was heartbroken to learn that a catalogue of mistakes had been made and all of the evidence was gone.

Speaking out: Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon, bravely came forward to give her account of how she was brutally raped and sodomized 16 years ago

President Ed Ray had offered an apology to Tracy in November, after years of silence, and vowed to review the university's response  to see if there were actions the school could take now.

But during their meeting this month, which lasted more than hour, he handed her a two-page letter in a plain envelope. 

It outlined Oregon State's internal investigation into its handling of her alleged gang rape in 1998 by four men, including Beavers' football players Calvin Carlyle and Jason Dandridge.

And while he said the university condemned the alleged brutal rape, and stressed that the institution had committed a 'moral failure' in her case, nothing would be done.

Ms Tracy, who decided not to participate in the case told Canzano she now wishes she had.

She  told Ray: 'I'm stuck with this memory of four men surrounding me, high-fiving as they treated me like garbage. It just doesn't equate.'

OSU head football coach Mike Riley suspended two of the men for one game and was quoted as saying they had made 'a bad choice' - a remark he now regrets making

'I don't know how to feel about all these people not caring,' she said. 'I don't know what this says about me, or human beings in general.' 

The four men were arrested in 1998, but prosecutors didn't press charges because Ms Tracy decided not to participate in the case. Tracy told Canzano she now wishes she had. 

The Oregonian  found that the university community never responded after she reported the assault and poor decisions were made by local police and the district attorney's office. 

Evidence was destroyed years before the statute of limitations expired - despite the strong urging by a deputy district attorney to preserve it.

Ms Tracy told how she had decided in 1998 to go through with a rape examination and then to commit suicide because 'I was already dead.'

But the kindness of the nurse who did the rape examination got her through and inspired her also to become a nurse, she said.

She came forward 16 years later because she remained haunted by the words of Oregon State coach Mike Riley, who said two players had made 'a bad choice.'

Ms Tracy went to police in 1998 to say she was gang-raped, sodomized, robbed, and then re-victimized.

She told investigators the men stood around, watching it happen and cheering the others on. At one point, she said she begged one of the men to make it stop but none of her attackers did.  

Two Oregon State football players, defensive back Calvin Carlyle, 18, and running back Jason Dandridge, then 20, were named as suspects in the report. 

The other suspects were Michael Ainsworth 18, a Southern California high school football recruit and Nakia 'Ken' Ware, a 23-year-old community college defensive back who was on probation.

Larry Roper, who served 19 years as the vice provost for student affairs told The Oregonian: 'Sex assaults were murky.' 

If Tracy's report had escalated to a student-conduct hearing in 1998, it would have been Roper's duty to handle any appeal - but it didn't. 

Roper added: 'I look back now and think, '(Expletive), we could have really done something.'

'We had no idea back then how to conduct an investigation, it was a difficult road. There's no comparison between now and then. 

'There's no point in even trying to draw a straight line -- good luck -- because one doesn't exist.'

Pete Sandrock,the former district attorney of Benton County in December 1999, was tasked with the responsibility of investigating the case.

He said: 'I came upon my name in the story and I just let out a, 'Oh s—.'

Meanwhile, at Oregon State, the administration could not do anything, because Tracy had reported the alleged crime to an OSU sexual assault support counselor named JoAnne Dodgeson.

Dodgeson talked with Tracy and later obtained a copy of the police report. The counselor gave the 38-page report to the university's student conduct department.

It meant campus officials had access to the details, but made questionable decisions.

At the time of the attack, in 1998, Brenda Tracy was 24 years old and working as a waitress. 

The blonde with shoulder-length hair was 5 ft 10 inches tall and weighed 140lbs. She was a single mother to two boys, ages four and five.   

She took a late-night excursion from Keizer to Corvallis with her best friend, Karmen McFadden, who were supposed to meet up with her boyfriend and a group of friends.

But  the woman ended up naked, in various degrees of consciousness, on the living room floor with men taking turns to rape her.

Afterwards, none of the four suspects asked for legal representation. However, all were read their rights and each blamed the other. 

The suspects told police the 24-year-old vomited in the restroom, asked to be left alone and said 'No,' at different points in the course of the seven-hour ordeal.

Ms Tracy recalls waking up with someone pouring alcohol down her throat and her clothes tossed around.

She said she was assaulted with a flashlight and digitally penetrated, and someone put ice on her groin.

Ms Tracy told investigators that she woke up at another point and found Ainsworth on top of her having sex with her. 

The others, she said, were standing around the room, cheering. She told police she heard someone shout, 'Yea dog!'

Ainsworth told police he took Tracy's clothes off and had consensual sex with her. The other players mostly denied involvement in the rape. 

Police obtained a search warrant for the house and found five used condoms in a bathroom wastebasket, alcohol bottles and a bag of marijuana. 

They also took DNA samples, including hair and fibers. A toxicology report the following day came back negative for drugs. When she woke up, she got in the car and drove home.

All four suspects were arrested and booked into the Benton County Jail on charges of sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration and sex abuse. 

District Attorney Pete Sandrock had a solid case on his hands, with copious amounts of evidence, but Ms Tracy was hesitant to set the rape case in motion because her boyfriend was a former OSU football player.

'What happened to me was not my choice,' Tracy said. 'What they did to me was not my choice. They violated me. I was garbage to them.'  

Lois Krzeszewski, a former Oregon Department of Education employee, served as adviser to then-Oregon State President Paul Risser on the Commission for the Status of Women on Campus.  

She said: 'There was a lack of reporting when it came to sex assaults on campus. 'We had a real problem, and everyone knew it.'
