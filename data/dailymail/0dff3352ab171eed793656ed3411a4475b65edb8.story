Stuart McCall says he hopes to be appointed Rangers boss on a long-term basis – after agreeing to join the club until the end of the season.

McCall replaces Kenny McDowall with the remit to get the Ibrox club, rejuvenated off the field following Dave King’s successful ousting of the previous board, out of the Championship.

And, while he is urging the dozen out-of-contract players at Rangers to concentrate on winning new deals, he made it very clear that he’d like to stay on beyond the summer.

The former Motherwell boss said: ‘Yes. Regarding the players playing for their futures and new contracts, I’m in the same boat.

‘We’re here for the short term, we know that. But we’ve got an opportunity to put down a marker. If we can do well, who knows what will happen in the future?

‘I’ve enjoyed being back on the training ground. It’s a big, big challenge. Anyone who has seen the side over the last three or four months will know that. But it’s a massive opportunity, privilege and honour. 

McCall will be tasked with rejuvenating Rangers' promotion bid with the team   third in the Championship

‘I’ve got a million and one text messages wishing me good luck – and I’ll need them all. But look at quality of squad. They know we’ve underperformed. There is enough quality in there to do better.

‘Football can change so quickly. There is no magic pill for confidence, which has severely lacking. But sometimes a new voice can provide a spark.

‘Their main aim should be turning things around. There are 12 boys out of contract, go win yourself a contract. 

McDowall was a reluctant leader at Rangers and was boss for 10 games, winning just three of those

‘Be there at end of season, going around a full Ibrox to cheers, rather than hurrying down tunnel being booed off.’

McCall spoke to McDowall on Thursday and intends to make contact with former team-mate Ally McCoist, still technically on gardening leave from Rangers.

His reign began with hard work on Wednesday, calling the players in on their day off to go through an afternoon training session, explaining: ‘Our aim is to get out of the league. The quicker we could get down to it, better.

‘They got a group text at half eleven to come in for half two, which would have been tricky for some of them. We had meeting, set a few things out, went out and trained in lovely rain.

‘To cap it off, the under-20s beat Ross County 6-1, So we’re off to a good start! It was a great to get back on the coaching field and I look forward to progressing.

‘People say they don’t look fit. If you are playing with confidence, you look a yard quicker. 

Rangers interim chairman Paul Murray said in a statement that McDowall will 'always be welcome' at the club

‘Off the park, things look to be going great. I’ve always said it’s important to have Rangers people on the board.

‘You don’t need someone Ranger-minded as manager. But somebody who knows the league, knows players, knows Scottish football was probably right choice.

‘In an ideal world, you would want to come in to a club in pre-season. We’ve got to hit the ground running.

‘The supporters don’t want to boo and criticise, they want to get behind the team. This club has been kicked for too long.’
