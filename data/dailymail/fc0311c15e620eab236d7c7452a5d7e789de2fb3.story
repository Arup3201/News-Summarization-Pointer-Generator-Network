Divorce can be a turbulent time, so why not do it in extreme comfort?

That's the big sell behind Gideon Putnam Resort & Spa, a luxury resort in upstate New York's, latest venture.

Previously renowned for putting on lavish weddings the hotel and spa has turned it's attention to quick splits with $5,000 (£3,000) weekend divorce packages. 

For that amount you and your soon-to-be ex husband can make a weekend of it with access to the baths and spa, tennis, hiking, swimming, golf courses and  ice skating, in between trips to your attorney.

Sound like a nice way to break-up? The 'Divorce Hotel' has only two criteria: you must be a US citizen and  agree to use the attorneys and mediators provided by the hotel. A jolly on the golf course this ain't - you have to be fully committed to your forthcoming divorce.

Over the weekend guests work with mediators to finalise the sticky details into a signed agreement and, if they choose, the whole process can be filmed as part of a new reality show made by A. Smith and Co., the production company behind Gordon Ramsay’s 'Kitchen Nightmares'.

Program founder Jim Halfens told the New York Post, 'Practically, they are divorced after signing on Sunday.'

'After signing, all work is done and we send it to a judge who only puts a stamp on it to make it official.'

Halfens, who already runs similar projects in his native Netherlands, expects to start up his services at the end of September.

Rob Sgarlata, a hotel representative, stated, 'They want people to get into an environment that minimizes the stress of the situation and that's exactly what we offer.'

He added, 'We welcome all kinds of guests.'

Problems could arise when weddings and divorces are held at the same time but Sgarlata says the hotel will keep the milestones separate.

'We would be sensitive to having them in different parts of the hotel,' he said.
