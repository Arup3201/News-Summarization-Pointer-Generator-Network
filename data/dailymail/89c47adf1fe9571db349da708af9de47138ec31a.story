Dementia sufferer Sandy Simpson, 72, was able to walk out of his care home in Aberdeenshire and was spotted when he walked past his wife Morag

A man with dementia wandered out of his care home and was only spotted outside on his own when he walked past his wife.

Sandy Simpson, 72, has been living at Pitcairn Lodge in Aberdeenshire for the last 15 months after being was diagnosed with dementia.

But wife has decided to remove him from the home after a number of blunders by staff including the pensioner being left to sleep in his clothes and on a bare mattress, as well as being allowed to walk out alone.

She said that staff at the care home, run by by the Birmingham-based Embrace Group, did not seem to understand her husband's condition. 

She said she feels the pensioner has 'no quality of life' at the home. 

Morag Simpson, 64, said: 'I was out for a meal with the Rotary club when I just happened to see him marching past the window.

'He has pretty bad dementia so he must have slipped out through an unattended door.

'It's a farce that this could happen when you think that we pay £3,000 a month to keep him there and the Government pay an extra £1,000 on top of that.

'I'm just glad I happened to be there. Anything could have happened to him otherwise.' 

Mrs Simpson, who separated from her husband in 2012 but then became his main carer, said there was a lack of understanding at the home towards Mr Simpson, a father of two.

She added: 'The other night, I went in at 9pm to see what happened at bedtime.

'When I asked where his pyjamas were, the nurse told me he didn't have any, but I sent him in with several sets.

'By this time, the steam was coming out my ears. The staff had told me he would get up and go through to them in the middle of the night, so I asked if he was doing this naked.

'It was then that she told me he slept in his clothes. How is that acceptable?'

Mrs Simpson said when she helped her husband change she noticed he had no underwear on.  She also found him with a bare mattress and no pillow cases. 

The choirmaster said she believes one of the biggest problems is the high turnover of staff which denies her husband the continuity he needs to help manage his condition.

Morag Simpson, 64, claims the high turnover of staff at Pitcairn has not helped her husband's condition 

Mr Simpson was able to walk out of the £4,000 a month care home undetected by staff caring for him 

The pensioner was found by his wife on a bare mattress, as shown in a picture supplied by the 82-year-old's family. His wife discovered his pyjamas and were left in a drawer and he was left to sleep in his clothes 

'Sandy has no quality of life there.' added Mrs Simpson. 

She is due to remove him from the home at Kirkton of Skene, near Westhill, on December 20.

Instead she said she will take him home to live with her and employ carers to help her look after the pensioner.  

Mrs Simpson has become her husband's carer and said she is removing from the home to live back with her 

A spokesman for Pitcairn Lodge said it was investigating the issues raised and the claim that no one apologised after Mr Simpson was left to wander out alone.

He said: 'The health and wellbeing of the people we support is our number one priority and we are taking these concerns very seriously.

'Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment on the care needs of an individual, we are committed to ensuring all residents receive the high standards of care they expect and deserve.'
