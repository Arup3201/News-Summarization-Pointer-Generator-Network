Oscar Garcia is poised to leave Brighton this summer.

Brighton are eighth in the Championship and just five points off the play-offs yet the Spanish manager has grown frustrated with the club's transfer dealings and it's understood wants a different challenge.

Swansea and Norwich will both be alerted by his decision as the former Barcelona youth coach has impressed with his style and ability to keep Brighton in the hunt for promotion despite losing players such as Liam Bridcutt and Ashley Barnes.

Swansea are considering coaching changes in the summer. Although interim manager Garry Monk remains a key part of those plans, the club are weighing up alternatives with Ajax assistant coach Dennis Bergkamp and former Chile boss Marcelo Bielsa among them.

Norwich will seek a new coach to take over from caretaker Neil Adams at the end of the season following Chris Hughton's sacking.

Malky Mackay is among the favourites but will have to settle any outstanding wrangle with Cardiff owner Vincent Tan first.

Garcia, 40, is young and suits the profile both clubs are seeking as they look to maintain and impose a possession and passing style to stay in the Premier League.
