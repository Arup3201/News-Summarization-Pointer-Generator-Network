This was never going to live up to last season’s sensational semi-final at Twickenham but, as opening Pool games go, it really was very good.

Saracens have been unable to reach the stratospheric heights they touched that day, when they routed the French giants in April with one of the most astonishing English club performances ever witnessed.

Back-to-back defeats in domestic and European finals proved a bitter pill to swallow. But Saturday’s bonus-point win over the star- studded Top 14 outfit proved that performance was no fluke and reminded everyone that Mark McCall’s team are likely to be serious contenders again this season.

This was precisely the sort of advert the European Champions Cup organisers had in mind when they streamlined the competition.

Six tries from wingers and two wonderful fly-half displays —although, sadly for Stuart Lancaster, not from Owen Farrell — and some typically thunderous defence left the crowd delighted.

Charlie Hodgson was outstanding as he played all but five minutes of the match before being replaced by Farrell in his first game for a month following a quad injury.

Two penalties and two conversions were Hodgson’s haul, but his all-round contribution in the pivotal No 10 position deservedly earned the 33-year-old former England fly half the man-of-the-match award.

It will be hard to omit him against Munster at Thomond Park on Friday night, however much Lancaster would love Farrell to have more time on the field ahead of the autumn internationals.

‘Charlie’s been good all season and I thought he was good again,’ said McCall. ‘We’ll always do what’s best for the team but we’ve also got a plan in place which you’ll find out on Thursday.’

The likelihood is that Farrell —whose knee was heavily strapped — will start next week. But Hodgson has done his side proud once again in the younger man’s absence.

‘We’ve been to Thomond Park a few times over the years and not come away with very much,’ said Hodgson. ‘But we’ve definitely come on over the past couple of years and we’ll see if that’s enough.’

In David Strettle and Chris Ashton — who scored a brace of tries each — Saracens also possessed two razor-sharp wingers. And their pack, led manfully by captain Alastair Hargreaves, proved a match for the hulking giants from the Massif Central.

‘The two of them have been in outstanding form for quite some time,’ said McCall. ‘Not just this season but for the past 18 months. It depends what you want to do with England. Do you want to go for youth or do you want to go for experience? You’d be doing well to find two better finishers. 

Strettle will be unlucky not to be selected in the England squad after his performance

‘I’m just chuffed we showed this energy and intensity against a high-class team like that. They are the best team we’ve played all season.’

Scrum half Richard Wigglesworth was also on top of his game for the home side, creating Strettle’s first try with a superb, darting break and kicking intelligently.

‘He’s definitely the form scrum half in England and I hope Stuart Lancaster and his coaches agree with that,’ said McCall.

‘What he did for the second try was brilliant. He’s playing some great rugby.’

Ashton and Strettle both scored a try in each half with the sides going in at the interval level at 10-10. 

Charlie Hodgson was the man of the match on Saturday after a fine outing

Zac Guildford had touched down and Clermont’s excellent fly half Camille Lopez kicked a penalty and a conversion.

After the break, Strettle’s second try was world class, courtesy of sublime footwork in a tight space down the left-hand touchline.

Ashton crossed again on 63 minutes, just seconds after Sebastien Vahaamahina’s try had been ruled out for crossing, as Saracens took a seven-point lead which they held until the end.

The only downside for Saracens was a nasty-looking knee injury suffered by substitute hooker Schalk Brits when his boot stuck in the artificial Allianz Park pitch surface as he attempted to step off his right foot.

Saracens insist the composite rubber crumb pitch is no more dangerous than a normal grass playing track but McCall’s unnecessarily prickly response to legitimate questions about the subject seemed overly defensive.
