As a pro-snowboarder he earned $170,000 a year, lived in a 4,000 square-foot home and traveled around the world for international tournaments. 

But Mike Basich has since shunned the frantic lifestyle and opted to live somewhere far closer to his beloved slopes.

He now lives in a tiny, isolated cottage in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Truckee, California, and now lives with no electricity or indoor plumbing - but has 40 acres of slopes with no one else in sight.

Former pro-snowboarder Mike Basich has built a tiny, isolated cottage in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Truckee, California, complete with its very own hot tub (bottom left)

It is set in the middle of 40 acres of land with varying terrains - which he describes as his own private resort

The property took five years to build, and involved Basich moving 175 tons of rock and hand-mixing all of the cement used on the foundations and surroundings 

It is set in the middle of 40 acres of land with varying terrains - which he describes as his own private resort.

Speaking to Laura Ling from Seeker Stories, he described how the property took five years to build, and involved him moving 175 tons of rock and hand-mixing all of his cement.

Now he has his own sanctuary complete with a hot tub and a chairlift he made from scratch with his friends. It operates through an electronic motor. 

Each chair has it's own tray to carry lunch and a drink while the route up has sculpture  

'I like to think of it as getting back to the basics of humanity,' Basich said. 'I like feeling connected to the earth more than I could with a 4,000 square-foot house.

Next to the house is a chairlift he built from scratch with his friends. It took him eight months to complete

'It gave me the strength to do everything myself. The project was fulfilling a childhood dream.' 

The house is fitted with an oven, made with a door picked up from a junk yard, and a fire where Basich does all of his cooking and heating.

He sleeps in a bunk next to a stained-glass window and there are no curtains. 

'I go to bed with the sun and wake up with it. I don't feel like I'm trying to race time,' he added.

'Like in a city you always feel like you are in a rat race. And here it feels like you are in sync with what is actually happening.' 

Basich stopped participating in competitions around 15 years ago and now spends most of his time taking pictures.

As a pro-snowboarder he earned $170,000 a year, lived in a 4,000 square-foot house and traveled to a different country almost every week

Basich says the project fulfilled a childhood dream and has given him the chance to reconnect with the earth

Describing his lifestyle, the former professional extreme sportsman said: 'I go to bed with the sun and wake up with it. I don't feel like I'm trying to race time'
