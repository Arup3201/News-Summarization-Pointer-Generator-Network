A 19th-century steamer that was once used to smuggle weapons, transport cash and could still be filled with gold has been found off the coast of South Carolina.

The SS Ozama was discovered beneath 40 feet of water off Cape Romain, around 30 miles northeast of Charleston, researcher Dr. E. Lee Spence revealed on Monday.

Dr Spence first discovered the 1028-ton, 126-foot ship in  1979 while carrying out a magnetometer survey, but only positively identified it this year while carrying out research on other ships.

The researcher and treasure hunter, who is officially recognized as its 'true and exclusive owner', is now hopeful that it will still contain stashes of gold after its history as a smuggling ship.

The vessel, originally named the Craigallion,  was made in Scotland in 1881 and in 1884, it towed a dredge used in the construction of the Panama Canal from New York to Central America.

But the following year, it wrecked in the Bahamas and when it was salvaged and rebuilt, it was renamed the Ozama after a river in the Dominican Republic, where it often traveled.

Dr Spence told Discovery News that the vessel was used for 'extensive gun and money smuggling to Haiti'.

It was also used to carry money, including $300,000 in paper money to Haiti which was being used to replace a previous form of cash.

The vessel, originally named the Craigallion, 
 was made in Leith, Scotland in 1881 and, in 1884, it towed a dredge (the Nathan Appleton) used in the
 construction of the Panama Canal from New York to Central America.

But the following year, it wrecked in
 the Bahamas after drifting on to the reefs. The ship was salvaged by an American steamer and towed to Norfolk. It was renamed the 
Ozama after a river in the Dominican Republic, where it often traveled.

Discovery News reported that the vessel was used for 'extensive gun and money smuggling to Haiti'. Newspaper articles from the time said that gunpowder guns, rifles and boxes of ammunition were seen on the docks.

It was also used to carry money, 
including $300,000 in paper money to Haiti which was being used to 
replace a previous form of cash.

In November 1894, it hit the shoals 
of Cape Romain while traveling from Philadelphia to Charleston and 
suffered a hole in the engine room compartment. The water filled the fire rooms, destroying the engines, and the vessel sank. The crew escaped on boats to the shore.

When the ship headed on her last trip in
 1894, Haiti's president was believed to be near death, and the vessel 
would have carried guns or funds for supporting his regime or for 
fighting it, Discovery News reported.

It is believed that the funds 
would have been in gold.

'We don't know that anyone searched for her,' Dr Spence said. 'Newspaper accounts said she was traveling in ballast, without cargo. This would have discouraged any attempts at salvage...

'Ships reporting themselves as traveling 
in ballast, often carried money and even other cargo. When you are 
smuggling, the smuggled cargo often isn't listed or is intentionally 
miss-listed.'

He positively identified the ship by its engine, size, type of decking and where it was found.

He said that he is hopeful that whatever is on board the steamer is salvageable as the steamer is 'in surprisingly good condition with most of the ship relatively intact and sitting upright'.

Found: The SS Ozama, a 19th-century steamer, has been found 40 feet beneath the water in Cape Romain and remains largely in tact. Researchers believe there could be gold on the ship

Hunt: The team will now fully map the vessel underwater to see how stable it is before digging into it

'Whatever is still there, we have good 
reason to believe at least some of it will be intact, as I have already 
brought up some unbroken china,' Spence said.

'As you might guess, I am hoping to find gold, and gold should not only be intact, it should still be shiny.'

Spence and his team, whose work is being funded 
by United Gold Explorations Ltd., will map the wreck and try to determine how structurally sound it is before starting to retrieve it.
