Sir Bradley Wiggins has signed a short-term contract extension to remain with Team Sky until April, the team has announced.

The new deal will keep Wiggins with Sky until after Paris-Roubaix, which he has made a major target for the coming season.

After the famed race over the cobbles, which takes place on April 12, Wiggins will switch his focus to the track as he prepares for the 2016 Olympic Games, as well as a planned attempt at the hour record.

Wiggins said: 'Everyone knows what this team means to me so I'm really pleased to extend my contract until the end of April 2015. I've been with Team Sky from the start.

'I've had some amazing experiences during that time and I hope there are a few more to come. Sky's investment in cycling, and this team in particular, has helped change the cycling landscape in the UK and I'm proud to have played a part in that story.

'Paris-Roubaix is a special race for me and I'm determined to give it another go in Team Sky colours. It's one of the toughest races in the calendar and my aim is to improve on my ninth-place finish last year. After that I can focus fully on preparing for the Rio Olympics in 2016.'

There had been speculation last month that Wiggins might ride at least part of this season's Giro d'Italia, which starts in May, but that had already been ruled out by Sky team principal Sir Dave Brailsford.

Wiggins is due to launch a new Sky-backed development squad, dubbed Team Wiggo, this season, and he is expected to ride with that squad after Paris-Roubaix as part of a program tailored towards the track.

Wiggins, the first British winner of the Tour de France in 2012, joined Team Sky for its inaugural season in 2010, and has claimed 23 victories in Sky colours.

Brailsford said: 'We're delighted that Bradley's extended his contract with Team Sky into 2015. He's been with Team Sky since the beginning and during that time he's been an incredible ambassador for cycling and an inspiration to millions of people around the world.

'Rightly he still has big ambitions for the future and everyone at Team Sky will work their hardest to make his final chapter with us a successful one over the next few months.'
