Jordan Spieth has not slept for nearly 30 hours because he is too excited about playing at The Open.

His Dallas drawl can’t contain the buzz at being in Hoylake and even after a long flight from the United States his face is fresh and lights up every time he mentions this major championship - especially when he talks about winning it.

Spieth doesn’t turn 21 until the end of the month but there is a real chance he could lift the Claret Jug this week. He nearly pulled off one of the greatest wins in history at the Masters, leading by two strokes in the final round before a Bubba Watson masterclass prevented Spieth from breaking Tiger Woods’s record as the youngest ever Augusta champion.

In the zone: Texan Jordan Spieth is thoroughly looking forward to The Open... and feels he can win it

No fear: The 20-year-old has already shown he has all the shots in the book

Spieth announced himself to the world a year ago by becoming the first teenager to win on the PGA Tour since 1931. He’s already cracked into the world’s top 10 and is all but certain to play in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. In short, Spieth is a superstar in the making. If he wins at Hoylake this week, his status in America will soar into the stratosphere.

‘I wouldn’t be part of it if I didn’t think I was going to win - there wouldn’t be much point, right?,’ he says with a natural and easy grin when asked about his chances.

Despite his origins in Texas, Spieth loves life by the British seaside. ‘It’s better than I could have even imagined. It’s such a cool town. The golf is incredible,’ he gushes. If the present career doesn’t work out, a job with Wirral Tourism is surely his. But given that he has already earned $3.8million on the course this year, he probably doesn’t need to take it.

Spieth has had experience of links golf from the Junior Open to his full debut at Muirfield last year. ‘This is what it’s all about, this is really cool,’ he says, grinning again. Spieth thinks he has the key links shots in his armoury too. ‘I grew up playing in the winds of Texas and learnt how to flight my ball and keep it low, so that’s a shot I’m comfortable playing even with a driver.’

But Spieth’s ambitions stretch beyond even winning this Open Championship. He is setting his sights on rewriting the history books. ‘I would love to break Jack’s record of major championships and if I capture one soon then I think I’m on the best path of anybody,’ he says.

Hang on a second – is Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major titles really a target for him?

‘Yeah,’ he responds. ‘I believe that each and every time I enter a tournament I have the chance to win. I’m fighting as hard as I can to win. Maybe I can win 20 (majors), who knows. That’s quite a stretch, everybody’s going to laugh. But hopefully I’ll enter another couple of hundred. But, shoot.’

That little Texan exclamation is another reason why it’s impossible not to like Spieth. His bold claims contain no arrogance or bluster - he even insists there is nothing special about his golf. ‘There’s nothing in my game that stands out as ridiculously good. I don’t hit the ball extremely far. I don’t overpower golf courses. My iron play isn’t the best there is.’

He is just a charming, engaging American kid. But he also happens to possess a competitive fire that could burn through wrought iron.

Spieth admits he was so emotional during his Masters debut that his hands ‘were shaking from the moment I arrived until the end of the week.’ Yet under the most pressure he has ever felt, Spieth  basked in the fierce duel on golf’s grandest stage.

‘I controlled my emotions better than I could have imagined,’ he says. ‘That gave me the opportunity to settle in and play my game, use the adrenaline, feed off the crowd.’

But how is it possible for a 20-year-old to stay so cool? ‘I don’t think of my age,’ he insists. ’I don’t think it as disadvantage or an advantage. I was just battling against Bubba. We could be doing that on his golf course on Saturday afternoon but this happened to be the Masters.’

Spieth was ‘stung’ by the defeat but he has had a taste of the big time and wants more, starting this week. ‘Winning multiple majors in a couple of years may be difficult, but I also didn’t think I’d be here a couple of years ago. You never know what may happen. The only things I can control is doing right things off the course and working my butt off.

‘It’s all about grabbing those trophies and eventually leaving a legacy I’m proud of.’

Watch out, Jack. There are now two golfers coming for your record.
