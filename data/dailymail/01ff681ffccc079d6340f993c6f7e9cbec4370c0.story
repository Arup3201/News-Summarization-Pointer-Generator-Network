Rob Fielding, 43, from Aylesbury, was reading in bed when a moth flew into his ear - and stayed there

A father-of-three who felt a moth fly into his ear as he lay reading in bed had it buzzing around inside his head for three days.

Eventually Rob Fielding, 43, a marketing manager from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, sought medical help - and ended up needing a 90-minute operation to remove the insect from his ear canal.

He said: 'It was awful knowing the moth was flying around inside my head.  Every now and then, when I felt it move, it made me jump out of my skin.'

Mr Fielding was lying in bed on 8 August when he felt the insect land on his glasses and then buzzed into his ear.  He reached up to brush it away, but accidentally pushed it into his ear canal instead.

He hoped it would fly out but then endured three days of the insect buzzing in his head, making him twitch every time it moved.

Finally his wife Joanne, 41, sent him to Stoke Mandeville hospital in Aylesbury for help.

Mr Fielding said: 'The nurses were all very shocked when I told them what had happened.

'One of them used a light to look into my ear and all they could see was a leg wiggling around.'

Mr Fielding was referred on to an ear, nose and throat specialist in Oxford, and told he needed a ten-minute procedure to remove the insect.

But the operation ended up taking an hour and a half as his ear canal was prised open and the moth pulled out with a tiny pair of forceps.

Mr Fielding said: 'It was my cousin's wedding and my whole family were going to be there but we had to miss it because of the moth.  I was devastated.'

The surgeon had to delve two centimetres into his inner ear to reach the moth.

The father of Fred, eight, Betsy, six, and Meg, four, said: 'After shoving a funnel into my ear they managed to widen the passage and get the moth out with a tiny pair of forceps.

'It was incredibly painful as it was next to my ear drum.  It felt as if I'd just come off an aeroplane and my ears had just popped.'

The dead insect is now displayed on the Fieldings' mantelpiece as a souvenir of the unlikely episode. 

'The kids find it absolutely hilarious and are obsessed with showing everyone our new pet,' Mr Fielding said.
