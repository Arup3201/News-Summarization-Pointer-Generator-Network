'Negligent': Inayat Inayatullah told a patient apparently suffering from bowel cancer to eat mangoes

A scandal-hit GP told a patient displaying signs of bowel cancer that he should just eat some mangoes, a hearing has heard.

The patient was really an undercover reporter investigating Dr Inayat Inayatullah, who had been allowed back to work despite failing to spot the symptoms of a cancer patient who later died.

The reporter was working on a Dispatches documentary aired by Channel 4 which aimed to expose wrongdoing by doctors who had previously been disciplined.

Inayatullah is now facing a fitness to practice hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, where he is accused of failing in his duty to two undercover 'patients', as well as writing a prescription while suspended.

The Dispatches programme, broadcast in 2011, appeared to show the doctor telling a journalist who was presenting standard symptoms of bowel cancer, 'Get yourself some mangoes.'

The reporter, referred to as 'AC', visitedÂ  Inayatullah at his East London surgery complaining of stomach pain, constipation and passing blood.

The doctor spent much of the consultation talking on the phone before sending the patient away with laxatives.

When he returned for a second consultation a month later with the same symptoms, he was simply given stronger constipation medication.

'This man's complaint was constipation,' Inayatullah told the tribunal yesterday. 'When asked him to sit down, how I can help, he directly said to me constipation.

'He put emphasis from the start to the end that he had constipation. If he didn't say it was constipation, I would look at it.'

In 2006, the GP was put under strict conditions after it emerged that he told a young mother suffering from cancer that she just had swollen glands.

Linda Geden went to see Inayatullah in 2002 with a lump on her neck, but he only gave her paracetamol and later accused her of wasting his time when she returned.

She died four years later aged 38, and before her death she made a statement saying her illness 'would not have got to its stage or spread if Dr Inayatullah had done his job properly'.

However, he was allowed to return to work unrestricted in 2009 after a panel found his fitness to practise was not impaired.

He was suspended again after the Dispatches programme was broadcast two years later.

Another undercover reporter, known as 'JB', told the doctor he had a 'funny feeling in his arm' which his wife was worried about.

Inayatullah failed to take a proper medical history, examine the patient fully or provide a diagnosis on the basis of his symptoms, according to the General Medical Council.

He is also accused of falsifying his notes on AC, as well as writing a prescription for a third patient while he was forbidden from doing so.

The GP claims he gave the two fake 'patients' adequate consultations, and insists the prescription charge is the result of a 'conspiracy' involving the chemist who reported him to the GMC.

'Why is she ringing you and blaming me? I never did it, I never would do it,' he told the hearing. 'Why didn't she ring the police and say, "I've got a patient here?"

'This is somebody who has done it being very clever, trying to harm me by conspiring against me. This is a conspiracy of a high degree.'

The hearing continues.
