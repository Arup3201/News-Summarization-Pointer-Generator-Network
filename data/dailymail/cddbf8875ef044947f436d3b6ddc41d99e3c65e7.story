It’s about
 time we all started giving Harry Redknapp the credit he truly deserves.
 His reputation remains well and truly intact as one of the best 
managers England has never had. Let’s not underestimate the job he has 
done at Queens Park Rangers.

A bunch of high-earning, under-performing players - a squad rotten to the core - has been shaken up and transformed into Wembley winners in a short space of time.

It reminds me of the incredible job Redknapp did at Spurs – taking them from the relegation zone to the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a flash.

Credit where it's due: Harry Redknapp won promotion to the Premier League with Queens Park Rangers

Huge difference: The former Tottenham boss has transformed the dressing room atmosphere at Loftus Road

Thump! Bobby Zamora scored a late winner to sink Derby County in the play-off final at Wembley on Saturday

When he took over, Ryan Nelsen - a 
senior player Redknapp considered the best at the club - came to him 
saying he was leaving, and telling the boss he had ‘no chance’ with the 
QPR squad because it was ‘the worst dressing room’ he had ever 
witnessed.

Eighteen months ago QPR had a player who chose to pay a fine of two weeks' wages - £130,000 – rather than sit on the bench for a Premier League game.

In January 2012 Redknapp’s chairman signed a player for a huge transfer fee, put him on £100,000 a week, only for the manager to then find out he wasn’t fit and was ‘mentally fragile’.

Just over a year ago Redknapp had reason to believe an agent fed a ‘story’ to a newspaper to whip up more trouble in the QPR camp.

At the start of this season Joey Barton told his Twitter followers he would not be playing for QPR in the Championship. Somehow Redknapp turned this belligerent hate figure into a dedicated professional and a crucial part of their promotion picture.

The critics tried to pin the blame for the huge Rangers wage bill on Redknapp, when clearly most of the players had been signed under different management.

The Harry-haters laughed as Rangers flopped, and seized on their golden nuggets like: ‘QPR’s wage bill is bigger than Atletico Madrid’s.’ 

Redknapp didn’t sanction the wages – almost all the high-earners arrived before he did. And those on big money were awful flops who refused to perform and refused to move away from Loftus Road.

That criticism of Harry smacks of desperation, and yet I can’t quite work out why people seem to be so anxious for Redknapp to fail. His teams try to play decent football, and at Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Spurs he achieved unprecedented success in the modern era.

After a succession of players and agents were allowed to strip QPR of its money and its dignity,  Redknapp has restored pride in this terrific football club.

Redknapp 
arrived to find a dressing room full of bad players with bad attitudes 
on big money. That situation requires strong and clever management.

The
 fact that QPR now find themselves back in the Premier League tells you 
Harry not only got the stinking, sinking ship cleaned out and floating 
in calmer waters again, he’s also steered it in the right direction.

If you’re not prepared to give Harry Redknapp credit for that then your dislike of him is personal, and a little bit strange.

What's the smirk for? Jose Bosingwa was the epitome of everything that was wrong at QPR last season
