A video of a young person being allegedly verbally abused by an Australian police officer has gone viral

' I will f****** inflict some pain on  you if you don't shut your f****** mouth.'

The teenager seems shook up by the officers threats, however it’s not clear where the video was shot, or when, or what the young man might have done to trigger the cop's reaction.

The video was posted to the Facebook page Victoria Police Corruption. 

However when contacted by Daily Mail Australia, a Victoria Police spokesperson said while the photos are blurred, it does not look like a Victoria officer's uniform. 

According to the spokesperson, Victoria Police changed their uniform from light blue shirts to dark blue shirts over two years ago. She also said the shield does not appear to belong to Victoria Police. 

There was a mixture of comments left on the page from people who were confused at the officer's response. 

Many believe the video fails to show what exactly triggered the cop's aggressive abuse and claim there must be more to the story.

One commenter accused the officer of losing his cool saying: 'The police are "supposed" to be the professionals. They need to keep there cool in all situations.'

Another commenter sided with the cop, claiming youngsters flout the law and need to be taught a lesson. 

'A bit of instant justice is OK, young offenders do what ever they like knowing they will never be convicted and have little respect for anyone,' he said.
