The U.S.-based mission that sent Nancy Writebol to Liberia, is bringing some of their aid workers in the country home, SIM USA officials announced Sunday.

While none of the returning aid workers are sick or have shown any signs of having ebola, they will be quarantined upon their arrival back to Charlotte, North Carolina.

The quarantine will last at least three weeks since the missionaries were last exposed to people infected with the ebola virus, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said.

SIM USA president Bruce Johnson said in a statement that they are working with health officials to be as cautious as possible.

'We will continue to cooperate and collaborate with them and adhere strictly to their guidelines in the return of our missionaries to the United States,' Johnson said.

The aid group isn't releasing how many missionaries were in Liberia or when they will return to protect the privacy of their families.

The returning missionaries will arrive in an area of the Charlotte airport away from the public. The airport won't say exactly where the plane will be taken, according to a statement.

Meanwhile, SIM USA aid worker Writebol and American doctor Kent Brantly continue treatment at Emory University Hospital where they are being given doses of an experimental medicine.

MailOnline's calls to the hospital on Sunday were not immediately returned, so it's unclear what condition the two Americans are in.

However, Brantley broke his silence on Friday and issued a statement  saying he's getting stronger every day.

Writebol's husband David issued a similar statement that day, saying Nancy seems to be improving.

Meanwhile, conservative pundit Ann Coulter has written a scathing column critiquing Dr Brantly's choice to practice medicine in the 'disease-ridden cesspool' of Liberia. 

In an article on her website, Coulter writes that Dr Brantly's mission in Africa was negated by the cost of flying him out of the country and treating him at one of the nation's finest hospitals.

'Whatever good Dr. Kent Brantly did in Liberia has now been overwhelmed by the more than $2 million already paid by the Christian charities Samaritan's Purse and SIM USA just to fly him and his nurse home in separate Gulfstream jets, specially equipped with medical tents, and to care for them at one of America's premier hospitals,' Coulter wrote.

She goes on to list several others problems in America, and regions where Dr Brantly could have been effective practicing medicine.

'Right there in Texas, near where Dr. Brantly left his wife and children to fly to Liberia and get Ebola, is one of the poorest counties in the nation, Zavala County -- where he wouldn't have risked making his wife a widow and his children fatherless.

'But serving the needy in some deadbeat town in Texas wouldn't have been "heroic." We wouldn't hear all the superlatives about Dr. Brantly's "unusual drive to help the less fortunate" or his membership in the "Gold Humanism Honor Society." Leaving his family behind in Texas to help the poor 6,000 miles away -- that's the ticket,' she added.
