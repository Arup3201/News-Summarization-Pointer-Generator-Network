These pictures show soldiers leaving the last remaining British Patrol Base, PB2, in the Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

They left the base for Camp Bastion this week ahead of the UK's full withdrawal from the country in 2014.

The former key strategic location, in the green zone, will now be completely taken over by Afghan forces.

Preparing to leave, soldiers from the 1st Mechaized Brigade loaded up all remaining equipment for the journey to Camp Bastion.

The 1st Mechanized Brigade is one of the Army's seven deployable brigades and is part of 3rd UK Division.

It comprises armoured, mechanized and light role troops, making it capable of a wide variety of missions anywhere in the world.

The Afghanistan war was launched in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.

It
seemed to be close to resolution after three months, when every major 
Taliban city in the country had fallen and Al Qaeda leader Osama bin 
Laden was on the run.

But bin Laden evaded capture, and while America was waging war on Iraq, the Taliban regrouped and regained control in key areas of the country..

NATO blamed the shooting on an 'alleged contracted security guard'.

It did not say if he was an Afghan or foreign national and provided no other details.

It also did not provide the service member's nationality.
