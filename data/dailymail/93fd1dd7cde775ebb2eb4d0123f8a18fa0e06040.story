Pippa Middleton and American reality TV star Kim Kardashian are the proud owners of the most talked-about backsides in the world, and now the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister has acknowledged their similarities.

Pippa has written an article for the august political weekly The Spectator in which she compares her bottom with that of Kardashian, who posed naked and smeared in baby oil for a magazine.

‘The “Rear of 2014” award undoubtedly goes to Kim Kardashian, after her posterior exploded all over the internet last month,’ concedes Pippa, whose own backside was considered to be the rear of 2011 when she wore a tight-fitting bridesmaid’s dress to the Royal Wedding.

‘I must say that mine — though it has enjoyed fleeting fame — is not comparable. But the Kim butt story did make me pause. What is it with this American booty culture? It seems to me to be a form of obsession.’

The fetishisation of the bottom has been a defining trait of U.S. pop culture.

However Pippa, 31, adds with lofty condescension: ‘Kim’s aim, apparently, was to break the internet, but I’m not sure she’s going the right way about it.’

Kardashian, 34, declared this goal when she published the photographs of her posterior.

In one shot, the daughter of Robert Kardashian, OJ Simpson’s lawyer during his 1995 murder trial, was pictured dressed in a black cocktail dress, balancing a champagne coupe on her derriere.

She also posed for a full-frontal nude snap.

It is perhaps no coincidence that Pippa has written the article in the same week that Kate has been making her first official visit to New York with Prince William.

Pippa is thought to be planning a TV career in America, with the NBC network reported to be considering hiring her as a correspondent on The Today Show. 

Last month she was filmed in the Mid-West on a ‘test shoot’, throwing shapes on the dance floor with a succession of male partners.

Pippa and Kim have more in common than just their behinds. Both have influential mothers.

While Carole Middleton is rumoured to have encouraged Kate to change her course at St Andrews University so that she would meet William, Kim’s mother, Kris Jenner, manages the career of her six children and is the driving force behind their TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

Kim shot to fame in 2007 thanks to a sex tape with her former boyfriend Ray J, which has since been watched more than 93 million times online.

Pippa, however, eclipses that number given her appearance at the Royal Wedding was seen by an estimated audience of two billion.
