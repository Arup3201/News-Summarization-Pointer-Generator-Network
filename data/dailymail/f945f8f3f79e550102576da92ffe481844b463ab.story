An air traffic controller has been suspended after leaving his control tower unattended as a flight was approaching the airport in Guyana, South America.

The Ministry of Transport in Guyana said the controller and two other staff members have been suspended pending an investigation.

The controller abandoned his post ten minutes before a Caribbean Airlines Boeing 737 from Trinidad was due to land at the airport.

According to the Jamaica Observer, the flight had to circle Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Georgetown until a manager was able to guide the flight safely from the tower.

A Guyana Ministry of Transport spokesman said on Tuesday that the other two staff members who were suspended were a supervisor and a co-worker who had been scheduled to relieve the controller.

The controller walked off the job apparently out of frustration that his co-worker did not show up to relieve him of his duties last Friday.

At the time, a Caribbean Airways Boeing 737 with about 100 people on board was ten minutes from landing.

A manager went to the tower and took over.

Separately, the U.S. Embassy in Guyana warned last month that it had received 'unconfirmed threat information' about Caribbean Airlines flights from the South American country to the United States.

Americans were subsequently told to avoid using the carrier until the issue is resolved.

The warning about the unconfirmed threats was posted on the embassy's website, but no specific details have been released.
