Ladies, meet your new best friend- the world's first ever walk-in wardrobe made of delicious cake.

Not only is this a fashion-forward delectable treat that comes with edible dresses, it also comes kitted out with it's very own iPad.

The item, which comes with a price tag of £800, was made by cake sculptor Steph Parker, 25, from Birmingham.

Steph Parker has created a piece of furniture that any girl would love to have - the worlds first ever cake walk in wardrobe

The wardrobe is made completely out of cake and comes with edible dresses and its own built-in iPad

The cake, which took 40 hours to make, has three flavours - vanilla, chocolate and red velvet - and is large enough to feed over a hundred people.

Creator Steph said: 'It really is a girl’s best friend. You’ve got a wardrobe for your clothes, shoes and handbags, which you can also nibble and eat when you’re a bit peckish. It’s a perfect combination really.

'I’ve also built an iPad into the door so you can browse for clothes online.

'It took me 40 hours to make but I’m really pleased with it. It’s made out of three flavours - vanilla, chocolate and red velvet.

'You can store anything in it - but I’ve filled it with sugar dresses - to keep with the edible cake theme.

'It’s designed around Victorian vintage which I think is really stylish. It’s been pretty fun to do. It’s taken a long time bit it’s really different to anything else I’ve done.

'It would be great to have in your bedroom as you can get a piece of cake everyday when you’re getting dressed. It’s big enough to feed over a hundred people.'

The iPad comes with the Pink Mothballs App installed - which lets users borrow and lend dresses with their friends easily.
