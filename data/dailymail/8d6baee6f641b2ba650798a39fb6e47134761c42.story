Scouted at the tender age of 15, Naomi is still one of the world's most in-demand models despite working in the industry for nearly 30 years; it's no wonder she's dubbed a 'super'.

Need proof of her longevity? The Brixton-born model has been unveiled as the face of two major fashion campaigns this week - and it's only Tuesday.

On Monday, the 44-year-old was unveiled as the face of Burberry, alongside Jourdan Dunn. Today, she has has stripped off as the star of Agent Provocateur's SS15 campaign.

Looking good! Naomi Campbell  has been unveiled as the face of two major fashion campaigns this week, her latest? Smouldering as the face and body of Agent Provocateur 

The model and party girl thinks it's 'great' she's been chosen to front the lingerie brand's new line because, she says, it proves women of any age can be sexy.

'It's great to be the face of Agent Provocateur's Spring Summer 2015 campaign, especially in my forties!

The supermodel was selected for the campaign for just that reason, with Agent Provocateur's creative director Sarah Shotton reiterating the message.

Honoured: Speaking about her latest campaign, the 44-year-old said: 'It's great to be the face of Agent Provocateur's Spring Summer 2015 campaign, especially in my forties!'

She explained: 'Agent Provocateur proves that beautiful lingerie applies to, and is appreciated by, women of all ages.'

Naomi Campbell is meant to be Agent Provocateur’s 'mercurial femme fatale' with a killer instinct and a body to match, say the brand.

The steamy images of Naomi were taken by photographer and director Ellen von Unwerth, who specialises in erotic femininity and worked as a fashion model herself for ten years before moving behind the camera.

Sarah added to Style.com: 'Naomi and Ellen were perfect for this, as they both have such strong, individual personalities. 

'We chose Ellen, as her aesthetic mirrors the sensual, mysterious undertones of the campaign concept impeccably. Naomi is the ultimate Agent Provocateur woman: witty, gorgeous and confident.'

Naomi's schedule has been jam-packed lately. She and Jourdan Dunn, 24, teamed up for the first time ever for Burberry's all new SS15 campaign.

The British beauties are seen posing in a range of the popular brand's colourful coats and dresses, as they tote bags bearing Burberry's distinctive plaid pattern.

Nerves: Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house - Naomi recently admitted that even she gets nervous before a catwalk appearance, although she looks pretty confident in this shoot

The catwalk stars are joined in the Mario Testino-shot, Christopher Bailey-directed campaign by British musicians George Barnett and George Le Page.

'It is always a pleasure to work with Mario Testino; we came up in the business together 28 years ago, so have an understanding and ease in working together,' Naomi said in a statement.

'His photography is special and the results are always stunning. And I was thrilled to work with Jourdan Dunn for the first time - it was a lot of fun.

'But above all, it’s always rewarding for an artist to work on a campaign for a world-class product.'

South London native Naomi is returning to model for the label for the first time since her 2001 campaign alongside Kate Moss. 

Big name: As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has been star-studded

Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house - Naomi recently admitted that even she gets nervous before a catwalk appearance.

Speaking to Net-a-Porter's The Edit, she said: 'I still get scared. I cross myself before I go onto the runway. I pray my dress isn’t going to fall off.'

Her biggest fear, she says, is fear itself. 'If you feel fear, fear will come to you. Fear is a terrible thing to have and I’ve been aware of that since I was a kid. It can stop you doing things in your life. I don’t want fear to get hold of me.'

Luckily for Naomi, she's been able to share the experience with her 'fashion family' - a starry host of models, designers and photographers, who have helped nurture her along the way.

'I definitely spent more time around them than around my own blood family as I was traveling and working so much… Azzedine [Alaïa] is more like a papa; Gianni [Versace] was more like a brother,' she said.

Another day, another campaign: On Monday she and Jourdan Dunn, 24, teamed up for the first time ever for Burberry's all new SS15 campaign

As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has rocked and rolled between extremes but she is, above all, a survivor.

'I don’t have to justify myself to anyone. I took off almost five years from work,' she said. 'But I’m a Gemini and I like to keep moving and doing things and being there for friends. If I go against my instincts, there is always a consequence.'

And one special man has helped her along the way - and now she wants to help others. '[Nelson] Mandela always said to me: "Use yourself to help other people."

'I feel that now more strongly than ever before and I try to do that in the best way I can,' she said.

She is certainly doing just that - she's raised millions for causes including Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake.

In response to the current Ebola threat, she has launched the #CrushEbolaNow campaign with other celebrities, which aims to educate and raise funds to help fight the spread of the deadly virus.
