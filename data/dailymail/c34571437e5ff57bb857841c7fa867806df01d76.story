Super Bowl winners Sidney Rice and Steve Weatherford will donate their brains to medical research following their deaths.

New York Giants punter Weatherford and former Seattle Seahawks receiver Rice  hope to help scientists see the effects of concussions as they study brain injuries.

Speaking on 'Fox and Friends', Rice reckoned he had eight to 10 concussions during his NFL career, with the first coming as an eight-year-old.

'It was the first time I ever saw stars, aside from the cartoon shows.'

After winning the Super Bowl in 2014, Rice retired at the age of 27 due to fears over his long-term health.

Since his rookie year in 2007, Rice said head injures were being taken more seriously, but admitted the culture is a tough one to change.

'It’s just the way we’re brought up. I guess it’s the culture,' Rice said. 'You feel like you have to be out there on the field. It’s the competition that’s instilled in you. You love it, you want to be out there, but it’s very important that you pay attention to what goes on when you get a concussion.'

'There are a lot of issues that stem from brain injuries and it's not just professional athletes. This affects everybody,' Weatherford said.

'A lot of my team-mates and a lot of close friends have dealt with concussions and the depression that comes with that,' he added.

More than 4,500 former players are suing the NFL over head injuries suffered during their careers. They are nearing to a settlement worth about $1billion (£655m).
