Salisbury District Hospital developed its own moisturising cream for patients recovering from burns

An NHS hospital has become the first in Britain to sell a product commercially in a bid to make money.

Salisbury District Hospital, in Wiltshire, developed its own moisturising cream for patients recovering from skin grafts and burns.

The hospital has used the sunflower oil-based product for 24 years, since it was created by staff in the hospital's pharmacy.

It has proved so popular with patients since then, that the decision has been taken to sell it to the wider public.

The lotion, which has now been given a lavender scent, is being called 'My Trusty Little Sunflower Cream' and will cost £6.99 per tube.

Profits from the sales will be reinvested in patient care.

The cream works by replacing the skin's essential fatty acids which improves its texture.

Currently, 20,000 tubes have been manufactured and the cream is available through the hospital's website.

A spokeswoman for the hospital said the cream, which 
contains five per cent sunflower oil, was an alternative to expensive 
beauty creams.

It has also not been tested on animals and does not 
contain perfume.

Malcolm Cassells, finance director for the Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, said tens of thousands of pounds had already been invested in the product.

He said: ‘I would be disappointed if we hadn't recuperated our costs within the next couple of months.

‘We've invested in PR and marketing 
advisers to take us through the process as well as manufacturing quite a
 large number of tubes ready for the launch.’

He added: ‘We don't claim clinical 
properties for this cream, we claim it only as a moisturiser but we know
 this product is really good.

‘It
 has been popular with patients ever since we invented it and many have 
asked to have it available for purchase after their discharge.’

A hospital spokeswoman said: ‘We just thought the time was right for it to be released.’

A spokesman for the Department of Health said the cream was the first commercial venture by an NHS hospital as far as they were aware.
