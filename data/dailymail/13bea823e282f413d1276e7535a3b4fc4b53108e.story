Their families are now joined forever through marriage.

So it is appropriate that the coats of arms of the Houses of Middleton and Windsor are firmly entwined as well.

Although Kate’s ancestors include carpenters and coal miners, they had their own heraldic design drawn up in 2011, shortly before the royal wedding.

Kensington Palace released this photo of the new conjugal coat of arms for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

And yesterday the Duchess of 
Cambridge’s personal emblem was linked, for the first time, with that of
her husband to create a new ‘Conjugal Coat of Arms’.

Designed by the College of Arms in London, it represents William and Kate, in heraldic terms, as a married couple.

The
Middleton coat of arms – which was applied for by Kate’s father Michael
– features three leafy acorns to represent his children.

Acorns
were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks. Oak is also
a  symbol of England and strength, and West Berkshire, where the 
children were brought up, has many oak trees.

In
the centre of Kate’s emblem is a gold chevron representing the 
Duchess’s mother, Carole, at the heart of the family. Her family name 
was Goldsmith.

The insignia will be the couple's coat of arms forever, but parts of it could change

The two thin 
white chevrons on either side indicate, remarkably, the family’s love of
skiing and mountains, while the background colours of red and blue were
chosen as they are the principal colours of the flag of the UK and 
match William’s own shield.

William’s design is a version of the Royal Coat of Arms which was granted to him by the Queen on his 18th birthday.

It
shows the various royal emblems of the United Kingdom: the three lions 
of England, the lion of Scotland and the harp of Ireland.

It
is surrounded by a blue garter bearing the motto Honi soit qui mal y 
pense – Shame to those who think evil of it – which symbolises the Order
of the Garter of which he is a Knight Companion.

Both shields are 
supported by the Duke of Cambridge’s ‘supporters’ – a royal lion and 
unicorn, each wearing a three pointed collar, known as a label.

in England, Thomas Woodcock unveils the new Coat of Arms for Kate 
Middleton's family in 2011

The 
label has a red scallop shell derived from the Spencer coat of arms, 
which has been used by the ancestors of Princess Diana for centuries.

Flowing
out from the top of the Conjugal Coat of Arms is ‘mantling’, which 
represents the slashed cloth hung around the necks of knights fighting 
in the heat of the Middle East during the Crusades.

Timothy Duke, of the
College of Arms, said: ‘Any married couple who are both entitled to 
arms are entitled to combine them in a  Conjugal Coat of Arms.

‘There
are different rules and conventions as to how this works, depending on 
who the individual is, but as the Duke of Cambridge is a Knight of the 
Order of the Garter his is encircled by the blue garter bearing its 
motto.

‘As his wife is not,
a wreath was made to balance hers out decoratively. Obviously that will
change if she, in the future, is made a member herself.’

A
spokesman for Kensington  Palace added: ‘The Conjugal Arms will be the 
couple’s coat of arms forever, but parts of it could change as their own
circumstances and roles change.

‘It was approved by the Queen earlier this year and can now be shown publicly for the first time.

A
man has appeared in court accused of stalking the Queen. Derek Milne, 
37, is alleged to have made threats that they would both ‘die together 
on judgment day’. Dundee Sheriff 
Court heard he had made repeated phone calls from his home in Dundee to 
both Buckingham Palace and Balmoral, demanding to speak to the Queen.
He is also accused of writing  letters in which he asked for details of
the Queen’s movements. He was committed for trial and remanded in 
custody.
