Former penthouse pet and mistress of the late cardboard billionaire, Richard Pratt, has returned to court in hope of, this time, getting her hands on a share of his wealthy fortune.

Madison Ashton, who was once showered with gifts as Pratt's mistress, claims she was in fact in a de-facto relationship and it wasn't just a 'business' arrangement, the pair had.

It's familiar territory for Ms Ashton, who sued the cardboard baron's estate for $10 million in 2012.

She lost and also racked up a million dollar legal bill.

Madison Ashton leaves the Supreme Court in Sydney in 2012. Ashton quit the escort business to become the mistress of late billionaire Richard Pratt in return for promised cash payments and other inducements, a court has heard. She's again in court to appeal the 2012 decision which she lost

The court heard Pratt had a 'voracious appetite for young woman like Ms Ashton and that promising her five million dollars wouldn't have been very much money to such a wealthy man.

The Daily Telegraph reported she attended Supreme court on Monday to appeal the 2012 decision, saying the elderly billionaire had 'intentions to create legal relations' with her. 

The court heard the pair had a 'prostitute and client' agreement but in 2003 Pratt asked here to stop and become his 'kept mistress', in return for a few incentives.

The Daily Telegraph also reported, the court heard Pratt had a 'voracious appetite for young woman like Ms Ashton and that promising her five million dollars wouldn't have been very much money to such a wealthy man.
