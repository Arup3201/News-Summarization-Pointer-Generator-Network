A student loan would give most people the chance to broaden their horizons and improve their mind.

But one undergraduate decided she was more interested in altering her body – and chose to spend all £10,000 of her loan on rounds of cosmetic surgery.

Katerina Christodoulou, 21, was given an allowance by her family to cover her living expenses while she was taking her degree at the University of Essex.

Christodoulou, pictured in hospital after her breast operation, hated her shape so much she spent her student loan on £10,000 on numerous cosmetic surgery procedures

She also took out a student loan, hoping to save up the money for liposuction on her bottom, hips, thighs and knees.

Christodoulou was taking her last set of English Literature exams when her final loan payment came through in April 2013.

This
 left her with enough money to fund the liposuction, and her boyfriend 
at the time offered to cover the cost of a breast enlargement. The 
graduate, who ended up earning a 2:1 in her degree, said: ‘I know that 
some people might be quite surprised to hear that I spent my student 
loan on my body, but it was worth it for how I feel now.

‘I
 could have spent my loan on my studies but I was lucky enough to have a
 supportive family who helped pay for my books and social life.

‘This allowed me to save my money. My parents gave me their blessing and were really supportive whilst I saved up.’

Christodoulou was supported throughout university by her parents and was able to get by without the use of her loan, instead saving the money for her surgery

Instead of buying books for her English literature course at the University of Essex, Christodoulou bought liposuction surgery to remove stubborn fat from her thighs (left, before, right, after)

Christodoulou underwent breast augmentation surgery at the same time as her liposuction as she found it difficult to buy bras due to her breasts being two different sizes

Christodoulou,
 from Loughborough in Leicestershire, went on to ditch her chance to 
earn a lucrative contract at a law firm in order to pursue a career in 
modelling.

She is about to 
have another round of surgery – this time on her nose. ‘I’m a hundred 
times more confident than before,’ she said, adding: ‘I did think about 
using the money to put a deposit down on a house but then I thought why 
not use the money to make myself happy now?

‘I hated my natural shape, so I had liposuction.

‘The
 fat just wouldn’t shift, so I knew I couldn’t get rid of the excess 
weight without surgery. And one of my boobs was a 32A and the other was a
 B. They were deformed and it made buying underwear and bikinis 
impossible. It really was a last resort.’ Explaining her decision to go 
under the knife again, she said: ‘My nose isn’t awful or anything but it
 could be better.’

However 
this time she said she would not be paying for the surgery with her 
student loan, adding: ‘I am going to get my nose job done on a finance 
plan as I haven’t managed to save up for it so far.’

A
 spokesman for MYA Cosmetic Surgery Clinic, which performed 
Christodoulou’s procedures, said: ‘We believe everyone deserves to have 
the body confidence that they desire.

‘Katerina is an excellent example of an intelligent women who wanted to improve her self-esteem.’

Christodoulou says that when she graduated she was delighted as she finally had saved enough for her surgery
