A flurry of solar flares has been spotted on the sun by a Nasa telescope.

In just one day more than half a dozen were spotted, in addition to several ejections of material.

Videos and images show the explosions in all their glory as material races from the sun’s surface into the surrounding space.

According to Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) team a single, dynamic active region unleashed over half a dozen solar flares in about 24 hours from 25 to 26 August. The two larger flares were M-class (moderate) flares and the others were smaller flares. This animation shows an ejection associated with the flares

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.

Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks.

The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.

Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.

A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.

Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents.

The event was captured by Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory from 25 to 26 August.

Two larger flares seen were moderate explosions known as M-class flares, while the others were smaller flares.

Some of the images were taken in a wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light, which is ideal for observing flares.

The eruptions began with an explosive mid-level M5 flare.

The flares originated from a sunspot called AR2151, an intense region of magnetic activity on the sun’s surface.

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, but thanks to Earth’s atmosphere they pose little threat to people on the planet’s surface.

However intense flares can be known to disrupt satellites in Earth orbit.

Periods of intense solar activity can result in bigger and more visible auroras, as more solar wind interacts with particles in the atmosphere.

The flare under study can be seen on the middle-left of the sun in this image. Solar flares are releases of intense high-energy radiation from the sun, which we see as a bright light. They are sometimes accompanied by an emission of material known as a coronal mass ejections (CME)

One of the flares as spotted by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) can be seen up close here. Periods of intense solar activity can result in bigger and more visible auroras, as more solar wind interacts with particles in Earth's atmosphere

According to Noaa’s Space Weather Prediction Centre this particular event, while impressive, the flares didn’t pose much threat to our planet.

‘Given the location of this event, the associated coronal mass ejection is well off the sun-Earth line and no significant geomagnetic storming is anticipated as a result,’ they reported.

‘Region 2151 had a history of M-class flare production on its previous rotation.

‘This event is indicative of an uptick in activity from relatively quiet conditions as of late, though.

‘The sun is currently peppered with relatively small regions, all of which are unlikely producers of severe activity at this time.’

Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), artist's illustration shown, has has been in a distant Earth orbit since 11 February 2010. It will observe the sun until at least 2015, after which its mission could be extended. Its goal is to understand the influence of the sun on Earth and surrounding space by monitoring its atmosphere

Nasa researchers in California say the sun has gone through a period of increased solar activity

@highlight

More than six solar flares were spotted by the Solar Dynamics Observatory

The medium-sized and small flares were all unleashed in just one day

The increased activity poses no threat to people on Earth's surface

But flares can increase the size and reach of auroras from the poles
