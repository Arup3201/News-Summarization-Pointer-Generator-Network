Victor Voronov is suing husband and former figure skater Johnny Weir.

Voronov's lawsuit, published by The New York Post on Thursday, alleges that Weir lied when he publicly claimed Voronov tried to rape him during a March 'Access Hollywood' appearance.

The lawsuit also claims that Weir bit Voronov a little over a year after the couple's wedding, and that Voronov filed a temporary restraining order.

Lawsuit: Victor Voronov (right) is suing Johnny Weir, alleging that that Weir lied when he publicly claimed Voronov tried to rape him during a March 'Access Hollywood' appearance

'In or around February 2014, the parties filed for divorce as rumors began to swirl of Weir’s violent tendencies,' the lawsuit alleges. 'In a blatant bid to rebrand his image from that of a battering partner, Weir appeared on a nationally televised program and accused Voronov of causing the domestic dispute by attempting to rape Weir. This atrocious statement was false.'

Voranov's lawsuit alleges as many as 2.5million people watched Weir's remarks against his husband, and that Weir tried to gain viewers by tweeting about the appearance.

The suit also claims the couple tried a reunion but that 'Weir violently punched Voronov and proceeded to angrily throw dangerous objects at Voronov' in a second incident, leading to a second restraining order.

In text messages to a man known only as 'Victor,' Voranov's suit alleges that Weir wrote in May that Voronov 'has Herpes.'

Lies? Voranov's suit alleges that in text messages to a man named 'Victor' Weir wrote that Voronov 'has herpes'

'The statements made by Weir in the text messages are false,' the suit says.  

Voronov's lawsuit claims that in an August tweet, Weir '[accused] Voronov, an officer of the court, and an esteemed attorney, of impersonating a judicial figure.'

Voronov was allegedly attacked after he 'refused to allow Weir to steal his medication' in May, the suit alleges. 

The New York Post said 'Weir’s entertainment attorney referred questions to his manager, who was not immediately available to comment.'

A request for comment from MailOnline to Weir's manager was not immediately answered, either.
