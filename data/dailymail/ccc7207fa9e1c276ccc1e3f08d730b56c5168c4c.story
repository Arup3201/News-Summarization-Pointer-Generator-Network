A retired Army officer has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his wife of more than 40 years who he stabbed to death at their home.

Leonard Webb, 68, entered his plea on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Winchester Crown Court but denied the murder of his 64-year-old wife Doreen.

Police were called to the couple's home in Durrington, Wiltshire, in April last year where they found Mrs Webb who had been stabbed in the chest. Paramedics were unable to save her.

Judge Keith Cutler told Webb that his plea had been accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service and a sentencing hearing would be held at which psychiatric evidence would be presented.

A statement released by Mrs Webb's family after her death said: 'There are few words to describe her. Our mother and nanny was simply the best.

'They were happily married for over 44 years and shared so many precious moments together, travelling the world and being around for their family.

'We are all still trying to deal with, and understand, this situation. We would also like to give thanks to the medical team that attended the incident.'

Webb was a major on his retirement from the Army in 1993, the Ministry of Defence confirmed, and had run a military memorabilia business before his arrest.

Judge Cutler remanded Webb in custody under a mental health detention order and adjourned the case until a date to be set.
