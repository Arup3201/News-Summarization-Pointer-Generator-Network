Former Fulham and Chelsea winger Damien Duff has signed for Melbourne City on a one-year deal.

The 35-year-old, who left relegated Fulham last month, is the Australian A-League club's second major signing in a week after David Villa committed to joining on a 10-match guest stint following the World Cup.

Duff has a century of caps for the Republic of Ireland and more than a decade's experience in the English Premier League, including two winner's medals from his time with Chelsea.

Melbourne 
City coach John van't Schip said Duff would be a terrific example for 
younger members of the team while still performing on the pitch.

'His career speaks for itself,' he said.

'He has achieved almost everything at club level and has been a great player at an international level too.

'He
 comes to us straight from the English Premier League with Fulham, so he
 has been playing at the highest level against top teams and top 
players.'

Duff played for Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Newcastle United and Fulham in the Premier League.

City,
 known as Melbourne Heart until a name-change was ratified last week, 
still have room for a monster international signing as Duff's wages will
 come from inside the club's salary cap.

The
 club has two international spaces left, as well as an Australian 
marquee slot free, and are expected to make splashes with all three 
positions.

City also confirmed contract extensions to teenage talents Stefan Mauk and Benjamin Garuccio.

Mauk will be with the club for two more seasons while Garuccio is now contracted for the next three.

The club began pre-season training this week but Duff will not arrive in Melbourne until July.
