Change: Physicist Stephen Hawking has dropped plans to attend a major conference in Israel in June

Physicist Stephen Hawking has dropped plans to attend a major conference in Israel, sparking a new row over treatment of Palestinians.

The world-famous scientist had earlier agreed to attend the Israeli Presidential Conference, hosted by President Shimon Peres, in late June, but has now changed his mind. 

He has joined a boycott organised to protest Israel's treatment of the Palestinian after a number of Palestinian academics contacted him.

Tim Holt, media director at the University of Cambridge spokesman, initially said Hawking's decision was based strictly on health concerns. 

However, it has now been revealed that the withdrawal is politically-motivated.

A letter sent to event organisers said: 'I accepted the invitation to the Presidential Conference with the intention that this would not only allow me to express my opinion on the prospects for a peace settlement but also because it would allow me to lecture on the West Bank.

'However, I have received a number of emails from Palestinian academics. They are unanimous that I should respect the boycott. In view of this, I must withdraw from the conference.

'Had I attended, I would have stated my opinion that the policy of the present Israeli government is likely to lead to disaster.'

Mr Holt's initial statement said: 'For health reasons, his doctors said he should not be flying at the moment so he's decided not to attend.'

'The decision is for health reasons. He is 71 years old. He's fine, but he has to be sensible about what he can do.'

A University of Cambridge statement released after the letter, published in The Guardian were revealed, read: 'We have now received confirmation from Professor Hawking's office that a
 letter was sent on Friday to the Israeli president's office regarding 
his decision not to attend the Presidential Conference, based on advice 
from Palestinian academics that he should respect the boycott.'

Hawking suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

The news provoked an angry reaction from Israelis. Conference chairman Israel Maimon said Hawking's decision was 'unjustifiable and wrong.'

'The academic boycott against Israel is in our view outrageous and improper, certainly for someone for whom the spirit of liberty lies at the basis of his human and academic mission,' Maimon said, calling the imposition of a boycott incompatible with open, democratic dialogue.

The Israeli ambassador to Britain, Daniel Taub, called it a 'great shame', adding: 'Rather than caving into pressure from political extremists, active participation in such events is a far more constructive way to promote progress and peace.'

He noted that former world leaders including Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev and Tony Blair plan to attend the conference.

Hawking's decision was hailed by the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine as support for its goal of severing academics' connections with Israel.

'This is his independent decision to respect the boycott, based upon his knowledge of Palestine, and on the unanimous advice of his own academic contacts there,' the committee said on its website.

Samia al-Botmeh, of Birzeit University in the West Bank, called Hawking's decision 'fantastic'.

'We tried to communicate two points to him,' he said.

'First, that Israel is a colonial entity that involves violations of the rights of the Palestinians, including academic freedom, and then asking him to stand in solidarity with Palestinian academic colleagues who have called for solidarity from international academics in the form of boycotting Israeli academia and academic institutions.'

But a letter from Hawking to event organisers proves otherwise
