After challenging the President to a series of live debates, GOP frontrunner Newt Gingrich has said that President Obama can use a teleprompter if he wants to.

The Republican hopeful made the gibe at a speech in Naples, Florida. He said: 'If he wants to use a teleprompter, then it would be fine with me.'

Following cheers and laughter, he added: 'It has to be fair. If you [were] to defend ObamaCare, wouldn't you want a teleprompter?'

My turn: Newt Gingrich got a coveted endorsement from New Hampshire's largest paper

In challenging the President to a series of seven live unmoderated debates the GOP contender is taking a bold stance but his confidence may be misplaced.

While Obama is an exceptional orator, Gingrich has comfortably held his own in the debates.

But with his Republican competitors concentrating on attacking Obama rather than each other, he has not yet come any real pressure.

Gingrich appears to have an unlikely admirer in one-time adversary Bill Clinton.

Explaining Gingrich's recent popularity the former president told News Max: 'I think he’s doing well just because he’s thinking, and people are hungry for ideas that make some sense. He's being rewarded for thinking.'

Clinton refused to predict a GOP winner but praised Gingrich's performance in the debates.

'I still think Romney comes across as strong and forceful and knowledgeable and I thought Perry had a better debate last night, he did much better than he's doing,' he said.

In his new book 'Back to Work' Clinton called Gingrich 'creative, flexible, and brimming over with new ideas' and, in September, prophesised that the Republican would make a comeback.

New Hampshire's largest newspaper today endorsed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in the 2012 GOP presidential race, signalling that rival Mitt Romney isn't the universal favourite and potentially resetting the contest before the state's lead-off primary January 10.

'We are in critical need of the innovative, forward-looking strategy and positive leadership that Gingrich has shown he is capable of providing,' The New Hampshire Union Leader said in its front-page editorial, which was as much a promotion of Mr Gingrich as a discreet rebuke of Mr Romney.

'We don't back candidates based on popularity polls or big-shot backers. We look for conservatives of courage and conviction who are independent-minded, grounded in their core beliefs about this nation and its people, and best equipped for the job,' the editorial said.

Mr Romney enjoys solid leads in New Hampshire polls and remains at the front of the pack nationally.

A poll released last week showed him with 42 per cent support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire.

Mr Gingrich followed with 15 per cent in the WMUR-University of New Hampshire Granite State poll.

Rep Ron Paul of Texas posted 12 per cent support and former Utah Gov. John Huntsman found 8 per cent support in that survey.

Those
numbers could shift based on the backing of The Union Leader, a 
newspaper with a conservative editorial stance that proudly works to 
influence elections, from school boards to the White House, in the 
politically savvy state.

No longer the favourite: The New Hampshire paper's endorsement potentially resets the contest before the state's lead-off primary

Front and centre: The editorial endorsing Mr Gingrich was featured on the front page of the Union Leader

The front page one editorial, signed by 
publisher Joseph W. McQuaid, suggested that the only state-wide 
newspaper in New Hampshire was ready to again assert itself as a player 
in the GOP primary.'We don't 
have to agree with them on every issue,' the newspaper wrote in an 
editorial that ran across the width of the front page.

 'We
don't have to agree with them on every issue. We would rather back 
someone with whom we may sometimes disagree than one who tells us what 
he thinks we want to hear.'

'We would rather back someone with whom we may sometimes disagree than one who tells us what he thinks we want to hear.'

While Mr Romney enjoys solid support
in national polls, the large pack of Republicans has shifted all year 
from candidate to candidate in search of an alternative to the former 
Massachusetts governor.

That
led to the rise, and fall, of potential challengers such as Mr 
Huntsman, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Texas 
Governor Rick Perry.

Yet with six weeks until the primary, The Union Leader's move could shuffle the race and further boost Gingrich.

Endorsed: The paper praised Mr Gingrich's 'innovative, forward-looking strategy and positive leadership'

In recent weeks, he has seen a surge 
in some polls as Republicans focus more closely on deciding which 
candidate they consider best positioned to take on President Barack 
Obama.

 'A lot of candidates say they're going to
improve Washington. Newt Gingrich has actually 
done that, and in this race he offers the best shot of doing it again.'

'A lot of candidates say they're going
to improve Washington,' the newspaper wrote. 'Newt Gingrich has 
actually done that, and in this race he offers the best shot of doing it
again.'

As voters started 
focusing more on the race, Mr Gingrich has turned in solid debate 
performances and found his stride on a national stage.

He
has rebuilt his campaign after a disastrous summer that saw many of his
top aides resign en masse and fundraising summaries report million in 
debt.

Qualified: Mr Gingrich once served as the Speaker of the House

In New Hampshire, he brought on 
respected tea party leader Andrew Hemingway to lead his efforts and his 
team has been contacting almost 1,000 voters each day.

Rick Perry will be endorsed by 'America's toughest sheriff' this week, according to NBC News.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who fervently backs tough 
immigration laws and their enforcement, will campaign with Mr Perry 
later this week in New Hampshire, sources say.

Mr
Arpaio is currently under investigation by a grand jury for an alleged 
abuse of power: He famously provided pink underwear for inmates and 
created a tent jail in the desserts of Arizona.

Hemingway's
team of eight paid staffers in New Hampshire has been adding more than 
100 volunteers each day, campaign officials said.

Mr Gingrich's team has lined up leaders 
in the major cities and has started identifying representatives in each 
ward in the state.

Mr 
Gingrich has opened offices in Manchester, New Hampshire's biggest city,
along with Dover in the eastern part of the state and in the North 
Country's Littleton. He plans two more.

Mr Gingrich hasn't begun television advertising and has refused to go negative on his opponents.

Yet The Union Leader's backing could give him a nudge in New Hampshire and provide a steady stream of criticism.

Four years earlier, the newspaper threw 
its support to Arizona Senator John McCain's bid and used front page 
opinion columns and editorials to boost him and criticize chief rival Mr
Romney.

In the time 
since, Mr Romney has worked to court Union Leader publisher Joe McQuaid,
who often runs columns on the newspaper's front page under his 
signature.

‘The Union Leader's style is we don't 
just endorse once,’ McQuaid told The Washington Post in 1999. ‘We 
endorse every damn day. We started endorsing Reagan in 1975 and never 
stopped.’

Nobody's perfect: The newspaper said 'Newt Gingrich is by no means the perfect candidate'

Preferences: 'We would rather back someone with whom we may sometimes disagree than one who tells us what he thinks we want to hear'

Mr Romney and
his wife, Ann, had dinner with the McQuaids at the Bedford Village Inn 
near Manchester, hoping to reset the relationship earlier this year.

Yet it didn't prove enough and Mr McQuaid's newspaper seemed not to appreciate the outreach.

‘Newt Gingrich is by no means the perfect candidate,’ Mr McQuaid wrote.

‘But
Republican primary voters too often make the mistake of preferring an 
unattainable ideal to the best candidate who is actually running.’
