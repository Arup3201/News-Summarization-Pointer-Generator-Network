West Ham have sold the Boleyn Ground, their home for 110 years, to developers Galliard, paving the way for their move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016.

Plans for the site, called ‘East End Village’, include 700 homes.

Fans and residents are expected to vote on naming apartment blocks after West Ham legends such as Bobby Moore, Trevor Brooking, Geoff Hurst and Billy Bonds.

The site will also feature a claret-and-blue theme to reflect West Ham’s colours.

It is understood the purchase price fell short of the £71.2million the stadium is valued at in club accounts.

No financial details have been disclosed but a report in the London Evening Standard suggests that the club will raise less than the £71.2 million the 35,016 all-seater stadium is valued at in its accounts.

Once
 the site has been fully developed experts expect it to eventually be 
worth hundreds of millions of pounds with the apartments expected to 
prove attractive to fans, investors and other buyers desperate to get a 
foothold in the London property market.

Blocks of apartments will be built 
around central public gardens where the pitch is currently laid, 
following the example set by Arsenal’s former Highbury stadium home in 
Islington, north London.

A statement on the club's website
 read: 'West Ham United can confirm that Award-Winning local London 
developer Galliard Group has reached an agreement to purchase the Boleyn
 Ground Football Stadium once the club completes its move to the Olympic
 Stadium in 2016.

'Following a competitive bidding 
process, West Ham United selected Galliard Group as the purchaser for 
the site ahead of a number of other national and international 
companies.

'The club 
was impressed with Galliard Group's links to the local community and 
their commitment to honouring the history of the Hammers at the Boleyn 
Ground as part of their proposed development.'

The first match to be played at the iconic Boleyn Ground was against Millwall in 1904.

West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady added: 'We
 opted to reach an agreement with Galliard because they are a local 
London developer and employer with origins in east London. We know they 
are committed to working closely with the local community and Newham 
Council on proposals to transform the site into a residential and retail
 village, which will benefit the local community and east London's 
regional economy.

'The
 deal demonstrates that we have been true to our word by securing the 
regeneration of two areas of east London through our move to the Olympic
 Stadium in 2016.

'In 
addition, and most importantly for us, we can see that Galliard are 
passionate about working with West Ham United to engage their supporters
 to help deliver a fitting legacy that will honour the tradition of the 
famous ground. We are confident that West Ham United fans will be 
excited about their vision and the way they plan to respect more than 
100 years of West Ham history at Upton Park.'

Stephen
 Conway, chairman and chief executive of Galliard Group, said: 'Galliard
 is one of London's most successful regeneration specialists and has a 
proven track record in stadium land regeneration.

'Working closely with 
West Ham and Newham Council, Galliard now plan to undertake extensive 
consultation with local residents and businesses and the West Ham United
 Supporter Advisory Board in order to create a future for the site, 
which is respectful of the cultural and economic diversity of the local 
area.'

Galliard Group is 
committed to an open and wide ranging consultation on its plans for the 
iconic site, including full engagement with Newham Council, as the 
relevant planning authority, as well as with local residents and 
businesses.

Sir Robin 
Wales, Mayor of Newham, said: 'We have always maintained that West Ham 
United's relocation to Stratford had the potential to deliver an Olympic
 Legacy beyond Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as a key part of the 
comprehensive regeneration of Green Street and Upton Park. The prospect 
of much needed homes, jobs and community spaces for this area is an 
exciting one.'

Galliard's 
proposals seek to provide new homes and both complementary and 
innovative ground floor retail and leisure facilities, complete with 
underground parking. Galliard also plan to undertake discussions with 
the family of Bobby Moore regarding the proposed development of a 
beautiful central landscaped garden, which would be named the Bobby 
Moore Memorial Garden, providing a fitting tribute to the legacy of West
 Ham United at the iconic site.

Under
 proposals also being considered, fans and local residents would be 
invited to enter a poll to name each building after a legendary player 
or an historic event at the club.

In
 addition, Galliard have commissioned world-renowned sculptress, Frances
 Siegelman, to create a statue of Bobby Moore and other artwork 
celebrating the heritage of the football club, which would be located in
 the gardens and grounds of the new village. Under the plans, the 
current West Ham memorial garden by the front entrance to the grounds 
would also be retained, protected and incorporated into the new 
development.

Bobby Moore's 
daughter, Roberta Moore, is pleased that there will be a lasting tribute
 to West Ham United on Green Street. She said: 'I have always believed 
that there should be some form of permanent West Ham United presence at 
the Boleyn Ground site after the team leave and I'm really pleased that 
the centre point of the development is planned to be named in honour of 
my father.

'Hopefully 
the new sculptures and buildings being proposed will also help ensure 
that a lasting legacy to the club, my father and his team-mates is left 
at Upton Park.'

The new village, which will have a construction programme of some 30 months, has an anticipated completion date of late 2018.

What will be at the site to commemorate West Ham's history?We were impressed with Galliard Group's commitment to honouring the legacy of West Ham United at the site. They have plans to name the key buildings at the new site after West Ham United legends, decided through polls and competitions with fans and the local community.Subject to approval and consultation, they also plan to name the central area of the development after West Ham legend Bobby Moore and will be looking to create sculptures and works of art to remember famous players and moments from West Ham's history. These will all be created in conjunction with the players' families and fans.

What will happen to the remembrance garden?One of the most important aspects for West Ham in the negotiations with potential partners was the plans for the Memorial Gardens. We are pleased that Galliard Group plan to leave the Memorial Garden as it is so relatives and friends of loved ones can continue to come and pay their respects at the site.

Will the commemorative bricks be coming?Yes. All of the names and messages on the commemorative bricks currently in place at the Boleyn Ground will be transferred to the Olympic Stadium. The Club also have plans to offer fans the chance to place new bricks at West Ham's new home.

What else will be coming with West Ham to the Olympic Stadium?The Club are in discussions with the Supporter Advisory Board about what they want the Club to take to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Those discussions are ongoing but the key parts of the Club's history are likely to travel alongside items like the commemorative plaques for Club legends and the West Ham Pals Battalion from the First World War.

Will local residents and traders be consulted?Yes, Galliard Group are renowned for their consultation with local residents. They pride themselves on their engagement with the local community and will hold regular meetings and distribute a regular newsletter to local residents and businesses.

What if I'm interested in buying one of the properties?No properties will be released for sale until consultation is undertaken and planning is provided for properties to be built on the site. Only once this is done will Galliard Group look at selling properties on the site. Galliard Group are signatories to the House Builders Federation pledge that all of their London properties are offered for sale to Londoners/UK buyers first, before being marketed/sold overseas.
