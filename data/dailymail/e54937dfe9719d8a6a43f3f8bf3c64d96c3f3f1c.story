The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that Ebola could become a global health catastrophe to rival AIDS.

Dr Tom Frieden said: 'In the 30 years I've been working public health, the only thing like this has been AIDS, and we have to work now so that this is not the world's next AIDS.'

Since the Ebola outbreak last December, some 3,865 people had died from the disease in West Africa, according to WHO figures until October 5.

Fr Frieden added: 'Speed is the most important variable here. This is controllable and this was preventable. It's preventable by investing in core public health services, both in the epicenter of the most affected countries, in the surrounding countries, and in other countries that might be affected.'

His grave remarks came at the World Bank meeting in D.C. as the president of Sierra Leone today called on the world to send millions of dollars, hundreds of doctors and thousands of nurses to his nation to help fight what he calls 'a tragedy unforeseen in modern times 

'Our people are dying,' President Ernst Bai Koroma said today as he spoke via video conference at a World Bank meeting on the Ebola epidemic in Washington D.C.

He described devastating effects of 'this evil virus' - saying children are being orphaned, doctors and nurses are dying, and Sierra Leone's health care system is overwhelmed.

Koroma said the world's response has been slower than the spread of the disease, and its spread will threaten people everywhere.

The presidents of Guinea and Liberia also made pleas for more aid to fight the virus that has killed more than 3,800 people in West Africa.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called for a 20-fold surge in international aid to fight Ebola.

'For those who have yet to pledge, I say please do so soon,' he said. 'This is an unforgiving disease.'

At the meeting here, President Alpha Conde of Guinea made an urgent plea for money, supplies, medicine, equipment and training of health care workers.

'Our countries are in a very fragile situation,' Conde said through a translator. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia also appeared by videoconference to seek a rapid increase in aid.

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim endorsed pledges on Thursday from the United States and United Nations to guarantee medical evacuations for health care workers responding to the crisis, an effort to ensure that enough doctors and nurses are willing to risk their lives to help stop the disease. No details were given at the meeting.

Kim also said that more hospitals and local health centers must be built quickly to ensure that West Africans have faith that they can get the care they need in their own community, and no longer fear that Ebola centers are places that people go to in order to die.

Kim, a doctor who formerly led the World Health Organization's global AIDS treatment program, said studies of past disease outbreaks, such as the SARS virus, show that 80 percent to 90 percent of the economic impact comes from 'the fear factor that surrounds the outbreak.'

The most urgent humanitarian need -getting medical care to treat people in their own communities - is also the best way to stop the spread of Ebola into other nations and counter the fear that magnifies its economic damage, Kim said.

'Trying to block your borders or isolate those countries in some way is not going to work,' he cautioned other nations.

A World Bank report this week estimated that the economic toll of the largest Ebola outbreak in history could reach $32.6 billion if the disease continues to spread in West Africa through next year.

'Every dollar spent now may well be worth more than $20 or $30 spent in two months' time,' said David Nabarro, the United Nations special envoy on Ebola. 

'This is a moment when there must be no postponement of financing decisions, no postponement of action.'
