According to his peers, Eden Hazard has been the most consistent player in the Premier League since he signed for Chelsea. But to win his elusive first trophy for the club he has be more influential in Sunday's Capital One Cup final than another dangerous creator/goalscorer – Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.

Hazard, 24, was named in both the 2013 and 2014 PFA Premier League teams of the year, an accolade only Luis Suarez matched. Suarez is now in Spain while Hazard is odds-on to be picked again for this season's all-star line-up.

His nine goals and six assists in the Premier League this season have helped Chelsea top the league and also have him top of most Fantasy Football charts, scoring more points than even Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero.

But something is missing for the Belgian – silverware. Chelsea have won one trophy since he signed in the summer of 2012, and he missed the Europa League final win the following year under Rafa Benitez because of a hamstring injury.

In theory, Wembley should be a perfect stage for him to offset his talents. His ability to dribble at speed past defenders with a low centre of gravity is second only to Lionel Messi. There is end product too – he has had 52 shots this season.

Although he hasn't won a cup yet, he has shown he is a big-match player. He destroyed Pablo Zabaleta when Chelsea beat Manchester City at The Etihad Stadium last season, and set up Chelsea's goal in the corresponding fixture there this season.

When Chelsea played City at Stamford Bridge last month, Manuel Pellegrini picked Bacary Sagna at right-back rather than subject his experienced Argentine World Cup finalist to any more punishment from Hazard.

Kyle Walker faces a huge test to stop the motivated Hazard this weekend. Although Spurs beat Chelsesa 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, they will remember their trip to Stamford Bridge the previous month.

Hazard was at his imperious best and scored a cracking opening goal in Chelsea's 3-0 victory.

Fortunately for Spurs, they believe they have their own Hazard equivalent in their young Super Dane Christian Eriksen.

While most of the signings made by Spurs to replace Gareth Bale have flopped, Eriksen has been an unqualified success, and is arguably as important to them in the big picture as centre-forward Harry Kane who is grabbing all the headlines.

Eriksen has scored the same number of league goals as Hazard, nine, and while he only has one direct assist, his strikes are even more important than his rivals, often coming late to save or win matches.

He has won 18 points for Tottenham – compared to Hazard's 10. Overall, he has scored 16 goals in 48 league games for Spurs, and doesn't take penalties to boost his tally.

At 23 and having been educated at Ajax under Dennis Bergkamp, Eriksen can thread passes like a traditional No 10, drift out wide to cause problems and most notably is stunning at set-pieces. His most important one helped take Spurs to Wembley in the first place – a magnificent free-kick at Sheffield United in the semi-final.

Eriksen ended up scoring both Tottenham's goals in a 2-2 draw at Bramall Lane that took them into the final 3-2 on aggregate, latching onto Harry Kane's pass in the 86th minute for what turned out to be the 'winner'.

John Terry and the Chelsea defence will be aware that any foul on Kane could be punished by Eriksen's accuracy from free-kicks.

There will be plenty of big names and potential match-winners on show for the first major final of the season – Diego Costa, Harry Kane and perennial big-match player Branislav Ivanovic among them.

But the destination of the cup might eventually come down to which of the two quicksilver midfield magicians hits the heights – Eden Hazard or Christian Eriksen.
