She has topped Vogue's list of the 
world's most stylish women, is the face of countless fashion brands and bagged the British Fashion Council's Style Icon award for the third year running last month.

So it is safe to say that model and all-round style queen Alexa Chung knows a thing or two when it comes to fashion.

And one winter trend she definitely won't be sporting is sparkly Ugg boots- and she has got the full support of friend Lauren Laverne.

Fashion faux-pas: It seems that style queen Alexa Chung isn't a big fan of Uggs sparkly winter boots

Support: Lauren Laverne supported Alexa in her distaste of the boots

In a Twitter conversation, the pair slammed the £185 pair of footwear with 35-year-old Laverne tweeting a photo of the sparkly black pair with the caption: 'Please tell me these don't exist and that it's all a dream.'

Alexa, 28, replied: 'I'm so sorry...People have too much time on their hands, Lauren. Too much time and too much money and too little self respect. Tsk.'

Lauren Laverne was the first to tweet her dislike of the shiny Ugg boots

Tsk: Lauren's friend Alexa Chung was one of the people to reply to her tweet

To which the DJ answered: 'As you like, run clothes globally, I am assuming you are dealing with this

'*Having the person who did this killed.'

The fashion muse responded: 'They're on the hit list. Along with whoever brought back harem trousers.'

Sparkles: The £185 boot is also available in gold, red and blue

On Ugg's website, the boot is described: 'With star-like sequins, glimmering metallic heel guard, and the iconic comfort of UGG, the Classic Short Sparkles is equal parts classic and exquisite.

'Flecks of corresponding sparkle in the outer sole enhance the shearling lined silhouette of this celebrated short boot.'

It seems Alexa and Lauren beg to differ.

Ugg fans: Drew Barrymore, Tamara Ecclestone and Britney Spears all love their Uggs but would they don the sparkly variety?
