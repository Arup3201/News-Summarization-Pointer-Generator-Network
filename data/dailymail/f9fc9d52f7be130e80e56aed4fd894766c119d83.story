A former Rotary Club president allegedly arranged to have his wife killed because his marriage was colliding with his desire to indulge in bondage and masochism with other women.

Bob Bashara, 56, the son of a late Michigan judge, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Jane Bashara, whose body was found in her Mercedes-Benz in a shabby Detroit neighborhood in 2012. 

He's accused of coercing a handyman to strangle her in their garage in Grosse Pointe Park.

During the murder trial prosecutors called several witnesses to the stand including a bartender, a local Grosse Pointe business owner and a medical examiner who testified his wife, Jane Bashara, had very few defensive injuries - indicating she did not have the ability to fight back.

The handyman who prosecutors say Bashara hired, Joe Gentz, pleaded guilty to killing Bashara's wife in late 2012, saying Bashara paid him to kill to do so.

Bashara is currently in jail for trying to hire a hitman to kill Gentz, who was already behind bars at the time.

Again, Bashara denies having any role in his wife's death.

Balancing act: Prosecutor told jurors  at the conclusion of a long trial that revealed Bashara living a secret life in suburban Detroit

Prosecutors told jurors on Wednesday that the trial had revealed how Bashara lived a secret life in suburban Detroit. 

'He created one world; he was living in another,' prosecutor Lisa Lindsey said during closing remarks. 'And when those two worlds collided, Jane Bashara ended up dead.'

The prosecution said the life he created revolved around 'Master Bob' and his desire to maintain control and create a new life with his mistress. 

The prosecution used Bob's own words to tell pat of the story. First, pointing out how Bob worked to get police to investigate other theories, such as his wife Jane's alleged drug use and that she may have been killed by a drug dealer.

Bob's own emails took center stage and revealed his intense desire to be with his mistress and not his wife.

'He would say anything and do anything to be with Rachel Gillett. Several people have indicated such,' said Lindsey.

Bob's connection to Joe Gentz -- the calls, the text message and the desire to take him out -- was pointed out once again to jurors.

During the long trial, jurors heard testimony from police, the Bashara children, friends and even girlfriends who talked about Bashara's sex dungeon below a bar, the Hard Luck Lounge. He was known as 'Master Bob.'

Other woman: Mistress Rachel Gillett described details of the couple's kinky sex life during testimony

Bashara's mistress, Rachel Gillett, told the jury that they had talked about bringing another woman into their relationship. 

The defense admitted that Bashara had major financial problems but he knew his wife had a job and savings. His defence argued that it would not have made sense for him to kill his wife when he had a steady stream of income.me.

There is no dispute that handyman Joe Gentz killed Jane Bashara, but Lindsey said he was threatened and coerced to do it by Bob Bashara.

Jurors didn't hear from Gentz. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a minimum sentence of 17 years in prison, but then said he wouldn't testify against Bashara.

Kinky: Bashara's former business associate testified the married father of two had operated a sex dungeon under a bar he owned called the Hard Luck Lounge

Complicated: Jane Bashara's friend said she never trusted her husband, who constantly lied to her, took money and flirted. Others have suggested Bob relied on his wife's income and had no real reason to kill her

In closing remarks, defense attorney Michael McCarthy said there's plenty of reasonable doubt about the case.

He said that Bob Bashara's adultery doesn't make him responsible for murder.

'Bob had no desire for Jane to die. He and Rachel Gillett would continue to live this double life he had,' McCarthy said.

Lindsey will make a rebuttal argument Thursday before jury deliberations. 

With more than 70 witnesses and 500 pieces of evidence, one of the largest tasks for the jury will be keeping all of the pieces in place.

Bashara is already in prison for trying to have Gentz killed in jail, in 2012.
