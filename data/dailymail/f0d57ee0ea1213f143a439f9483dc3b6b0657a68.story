A routine traffic stop by a police officer landed a sheriff's office a surprise seizure of nearly $500,000 in drug money during a search.

The deputy pulled over the vehicle in Houston, Texas, off the I-10 East after noting the driver acting nervously when the officer approached the vehicle, Harris County Sheriff's Office said.

The driver told the deputy he was a construction worker who was just getting off work, but the officer noted the driver's clothes were too clean to have been worn in a building site, sheriff's officials said.

A routine traffic stop by a deputy in Houston, Texas, landed the county sheriff's office a surprise seizure of nearly $500,000 in drug money and packages of narcotics (pictured) linked to a notorious Mexican cartel

A search of the car, which was seized on Wednesday last week, found $448,000 in cash and several bags in the front seat. Both the money, bags and the vehicle were seized.

The driver said the Gulf Coast Cartel, a notorious Mexican drug trafficker syndicate, paid him to deliver the money, according to sheriff's officials.

The driver and the car were transported to the sheriff's office in Wallisville where a dog unit sniffed out the drugs in packages inside the vehicle. The driver was not arrested pending an investigation.

The seizure is the second in recent weeks for the Harris County Sheriff's Office which last week discovered $12,000 in another vehicle search. 

Mexico is struggling under the grip of deadly drug cartels - but the authorities are fighting back and in recent months have scored a number of hi-profile arrests of infamous cartel heads.

Last month, the security forces captured the leader of the once-feared Juarez Cartel in the country's restive north, the second drug kingpin which fell in just a number of days.

Vicente Carrillo, 51, long-time head of the Juarez Cartel, was a fierce rival of Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. 

The car was stopped off the I-10 and was seized and searched after the deputy noted the driver was 'nervous'

Carrillo's rival was the world's most wanted drug boss until his capture in February.

A two-year turf war between the two gangs unleashed a bloodbath in Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state on Mexico's border with Texas, making it one of the most violent places in the world.

Politicians and members of the security forces have long been linked to the deadly cartels.

Last month, a Mexican mayor and his wife were accused of being involved in the disappearance of 43 students who were believed to have been abducted by a 'narco' syndicate.

Jose Luis Abarca, who is mayor of Iguala and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa were both accused of having strong links with the Guerreros Unidos cartel.

Mr Arbarca ordered the arrest of the 43 students who were protesting against the drugs gang in September, and who were then handed over to the cartel.

The cartel is understood to have paid Arbarca a monthly retainer of up to $220,000 and effectively ran the city of Iguala in the Guerrero state. 

More than 60,000 have been killed in Mexico's drug wars between 2006 to 2012, according to Human Rights Watch.
