Year after year, the ladies of Liverpool dress to the nines and brave the goosebumps to parade around the Aintree racecourse in their finery.

And now the Beauty Bazaar from Harvey Nichols is landing at the Grand National to help the glamorous northerners avoid any last minute beauty mishaps.

The Beauty Bazaar will host an exclusive 
on-site ‘SOS’ tent: a one-stop beauty-fix area that will be on hand between 7am and 9pm to rescue rain damaged 
hairdos, solve chipped nail disasters and offer mak-eup touch ups.

There will also be semi-permanent lash application by Lash Parlour, high-definition eyebrows from Blink Brow Bar and a choice of make-overs from brands including Benefit, MAC, Bobbi Brown, Nars and more.

With as many as 156,000 people attending the Merseyside meeting, including famous faces such as Coleen Rooney and Carly Cole, it is no wonder that the ladies want to look their best.

The Beauty Bazaar located permanently within 
Liverpool's Harvey Nichols store has been taking bookings for the big 
day since January and are opening at 7am all week in the run-up to the event next Friday.

But what advice do Beauty Bazaar's resident experts have for those looking to impress this year?

Pray for sun: Last year's showers dampened the team spirit but the Beauty Bazaar hopes that its pop-up will tend to any beauty mishaps

'This season, colour brands such as Nars and Shu Uemura have been popular
with our Liverpool customers.

'Also it’s all about skin this season. Carita located on our first floor 
have a wide range of non-surgical facials that leave your skin 
rejuvenated and radiant.

'This means your make up with not only stay on 
for longer, but your skin will remain hydrated and glowing,' said a spokesman.

When it comes to Ladies’ Day at Aintree, there is no race more hotly contested than the one between the fashion pack. But from over-frilly dresses to streaky fake tans, some people still manage to get it wrong.

Last year's mishaps: It was streak central in 2012 as racegoers braved the rain

'Make sure you’re fully prepped. No one wants to experience a chipped 
nail, a streaky tan or a flat blow dry and The Champagne Nail Bar, The 
Studio by James Read and Electric Hair Lounge will 
ensure you’re looking your best.

'Instant tans are one thing to avoid in this weather. With the cold and 
possibility of rain or even snow, instant tanning should be avoided to 
prevent the possibility of streaking tans.'

See you at the starting line.
