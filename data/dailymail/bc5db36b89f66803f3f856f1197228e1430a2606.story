Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was last night at the centre of claims that his office relaxed rules to allow Tory special advisers to campaign in the Rochester by-election.

A Tory Party source said Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office head of ethics and propriety, had allowed telephone canvassing.

But such campaigning would appear to have required bending the rules of the strict code of conduct governing political activity by special advisers.

However, the source said: 'This went right to the top and it was clear this was within the rules.'

The row erupted after Theresa May's aides Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson were blocked as parliamentary candidates by Tory HQ. It is likely to prompt questions from Opposition MPs about whether other taxpayer-funded officials have broken rules by taking a direct role in a political campaign. 

Labour's Cabinet Office spokesman Jon Ashworth said: 'There are serious question marks here which Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood needs to clear up. I will be asking him to provide answers about what guidance has been given.'

Sir Jeremy is a powerful force at No10. David Cameron once joked: 'Remind me, Jeremy, do you work for me or do I work for you?' Critics claim he was complicit in the culture of 'sofa government' when Tony Blair was PM. He was nicknamed Sir Cover-up after preventing the Iraq War inquiry from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Mr Blair and George W Bush in the run-up to the conflcit.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's director of communications, Steve Lotinga (left), was paid £105,000. William Hague still employs Arminka Helic (right) on a salary of £70,000 – even though she has now been elevated to the Lords. One of George Osborne's advisers, Rupert Harrison (centre), received a 19 per cent raise last year, taking his pay to £95,000

The news comes as it emerged that the multi-million-pound pay of ministers' special advisers has soared by £1.2million in just one year – despite David Cameron's pledge to cut the cost of politics.

There are 103 so-called 'spads' working in Whitehall, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £8.4million, figures published yesterday show. This is 17 per cent more than the £7.2million last year, and far higher than the £5.9million during Gordon Brown's last 12 months in power. The number of spads is up on the 98 in place a year ago and 71 just after the Coalition took office.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's director of communications, Steve Lotinga, was paid £105,000. Mr Clegg has 20 spads – which Labour points out is more than the number of female Lib Dem MPs. The Prime Minister has 26.

William Hague still employs Arminka Helic on a salary of £70,000 – even though she has now been elevated to the Lords.

One of George Osborne's advisers, Rupert Harrison, received a 19 per cent raise last year, taking his pay to £95,000. The Tories had promised at the last election to cap the number of spads, and the Liberal Democrats pledged they should be paid out of political funds, not taxpayer coffers.

The latest figures, released by the Cabinet Office, show that six advisers are being paid £100,000 or more, with the list topped by Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn and his director of communications Craig Oliver, who each received £140,000.
