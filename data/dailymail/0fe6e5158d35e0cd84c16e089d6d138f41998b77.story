Rupert Murdoch showed his softer side today as he paid an emotional tribute to his late mother, telling 1,000 mourners at her funeral: ‘Her love gave me more than I could ever hope to repay’.

The billionaire media mogul spoke at Dame Elisabeth Murdoch’s memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne, Australia - also attended by his wife Wendi Deng, 44, and other relatives.

Mr Murdoch, 81, said his mother ‘lived entirely’ for her late husband Sir Keith Murdoch, who died six decades ago, and she never remarried because she did not find herself in love with anyone but him.

‘She knew we started out with many 
advantages in life, but the greatest advantage was the one she gave us 
all - we knew that we were loved,’ the News Corp CEO told the cathedral.

‘It was OK 
to stumble,’ he said of his mother, who died on December 5 aged 103. 
‘She just wanted to make sure we understood the gravity of our actions 
and the impact our choices had on others.’

The
tribute came after 18 months of intense scrutiny in Britain and the US 
over the phone-hacking scandal that resulted in the closure of his 
168-year-old News of the World newspaper in July 2011.

Mr
Murdoch added that the concept of ‘love’ for his mother was something 
‘strong and reliable’ and she wanted it to be ‘something that brings you
comfort and peace when you're lonely or troubled’.

Dame Elisabeth, who married Australian journalist and newspaper publisher Sir Keith aged 19 in 1928, was appointed a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 1963 for her extraordinary charitable work.

She was patron of more than 100 charities, as well as being mother to four children including Rupert, Janet Calvert-Jones and Anne Kantor. Her eldest daughter Helen Handbury died eight years ago.

Mr Murdoch emphasised that his mother 
was strict with her children. In a well-known reflection of this, none of the
tabloids the media mogul owns in Australia have ever dared to print topless Page 3

The funeral was attended by a number of prominent Australians, such as former prime minister John Howard, 73, and comedian Barry Humphries, 78, who was there with his wife Lizzie Spender, 62.

Also present were Dame Elisabeth's grandson Lachlan Murdoch, 41, and his wife Sarah, 40, along with their children Kalan, 8, and Aidan, 6, as well as another ex-prime minister in Malcolm Fraser, 82.

Mr Murdoch also spoke about how his 
mother once specifically insisted that architects designing a children’s
hospital lowered the windows so that children could see outside, 
reported the AAP agency.

She
was involved with horticultural, ballet and prison organisations, as 
well as helping children in care and the mentally ill. The Reverend 
Andrew St John said she was ‘certainly’ a ‘cheerful giver’.

Mr
Murdoch praised her for giving Sir Keith ‘a life of happiness that 
other men can only envy’ and for always putting ‘the needs of the less 
fortunate before her own’ through her ‘unmatched generosity’.

The
service, which took place at 11am local time (midnight GMT), was also 
broadcast on big screens outside the cathedral in Federation Square 
where it was watched by hundreds more people.

Dame
Elisabeth died peacefully in her sleep a fortnight ago. She is survived
by three children and 77 direct descendants, including five great-great
grandchildren, and would have been 104 in January.
