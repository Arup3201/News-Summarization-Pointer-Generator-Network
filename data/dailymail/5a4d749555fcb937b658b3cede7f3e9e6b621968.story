A jilted wife who is selling her estranged husband's half of a romantic Bali holiday on eBay has seen the bidding soar to $50,000 a day before the auction is due to end.

Sarah-Jane Bell, from north Brisbane near Caboolture, started looking for a new travel partner online after she booked a surprise holiday to the Indonesian holiday island with her husband, but he left her by leaving a note on the bed.

The 24-year-old posted the ad to eBay on Sunday, and has since attracted 75 offers with the bid sitting at $50,000 on Thursday morning. The trip originally cost her just $2500.

Sarah-Jane, from Brisbane, is selling her estranged husband's half of a holiday to Bali on eBay

Ms Bell said she returned home on September 20 last year to find that her husband (pictured left) had gone

She has received  75 offers with the bid sitting at $50,000 on Thursday morning

Ms Bell said she was only looking to recuperate the $300 name change fee on the ticket when she first posted to ad, offering to sell return flights and accommodation in Kuta for anyone willing to spend nine days with a 'complete stranger'.

'I didn't expect it to go this far,' she told the Today Show.

Her eBay stunt has paid off the holiday and given her more than $47,000 in spending money - with the dollar amount expect to climb even higher before the auction ends on Friday morning at 9.48am AEDT.

The Virgin Australia return flights Ms Bell booked cost $1264 for two people and the room at luxury Kuta Beach Heritage Hotel cost just over $1200.

The newly single 24-year-old clarified that she was not looking to have a steamy getaway - despite the fact she will be sharing a king size bed with her travel partner.

'First thing is it's not a sexed up holiday in any way, shape or form. I just want to really reiterate that,' she said.

'Basically I am looking for someone who is crazy but down to earth and wants to experience it all but really indulge at the same time.'

Ms Bell was shocked when she returned home on September 20 last year to find that her husband - who she does not wish to identify - had left her a note saying he was no longer in love after eight years together.

'He still isn't able to give me a definitive answer as to why he left and why he doesn't love me anymore,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's pretty gut wrenching to be honest but everything happens for a reason and I've tried to put a positive spin on the whole thing.'

There have been 32 bids placed since the listing was posted on Sunday, with the current bid sitting at $4300

Ms Bell, who said the couple got married in 2012 on their six-year anniversary, added she had no idea the break up was coming.

'He'd been working away from home quite a lot last year, which put a bit of turmoil on our relationship, but I thought we were stronger than that,' she said.

Ms Bell said following the split she offered the Bali trip to three of her closest friends but when they weren't available she decided to take a gamble and sell it on eBay.

'Unfortunately, due to a series of unfavourable circumstances, my husband decided to pack up and call it quits, leaving a note on the bed when I returned from work,' she wrote in the listing.

'The rest is history, and that's why I have opted for the exciting option of none other but to AUCTION the return flight and accommodation with myself right here!'

The 24-year-old said she would accept bids from males and females, but they must be aged between 18 and 32.

'I'm not looking for a relationship out of this, if anything more comes from it I'm not saying no but I'm not saying yes, I'm open to the experience,' she said. 

Bidders must message her after placing a bid and agree to a phone call, and the winning person must agree to a lunch 'meet and greet' before the departure date on February 3.

The 24-year-old said a number of people had already been in contact, adding that she doesn't have a specific type of person she hopes will win.

'I just want someone down-to-earth and ready for a bit of adventure,' she said.

Sarah-Jane says she is 'adventurous' and promises plenty of exciting experiences, including scootering around Bali and 'many' pub crawls

Ms Bell says she is 'adventurous' and promises plenty of exciting experiences, including scootering around Bali and its rainforests, 'many, MANY pub crawls', trying strange Indonesian foods and visiting the Monkey Temple.

She describes herself as an avid animal lover and a happy-go-lucky individual who is 'looking for the next exciting adventure in life.'

'Don't quite know what I am looking for in life, as it seems like the life plan I had has been completely turned upside down,' she said.

'All I do know is I don't want to live with a life full of regrets.

'Happy to try everything once in life, and maybe twice if I didn't learn the first time around haha!'

She said her potential travel partner must be aged between 18 and 32 and agree to meet before the holiday
