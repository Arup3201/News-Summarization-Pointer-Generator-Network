Hoodie ban: Jason Corkovic argued against an Order imposed on him which restricts him from wearing a hoodie jumper

An armed robber who claimed a hoodie ban would violate his human right  to ‘keep his head dry from Manchester rain’ was told by a judge to use a flat cap instead.

Jason Corkovic insisted that he needed to wear a hoodie because he hoped to work in the building trade when he was released from prison and might need one.

The astonishing claim was made by his lawyer, Jane Miller, after the 41-year-old and two accomplices were convicted of a plot to rob £90,000 from a cash delivery van.

‘There are factors such as rain to contend with,’ she told a judge.

‘When one walks down the street one likes to keep one’s head dry.

‘I wonder whether to prevent a person from wearing a top with a hood, being a gentleman in Manchester, which has a propensity to endure rain, might be to have his human rights interfered with.’

But Judge Roger Thomas QC told Corkovic he should wear a traditional flat cap instead.

‘Let’s not be silly about this – you say Mr Corkovic is a gentleman, well then, he can use a furled umbrella,’ he added.

‘Or what about a flat cap?

'There was a time 50 years ago when every man was walking around with a flat cap.’

Justice campaigners last night condemned defence lawyers for playing the ‘human rights’ card.

A spokesman for Families Against Crime
said: ‘If Corkovic wants to talk about human rights, let’s talk about 
the rights of the driver of the security van he was about to rob – 
surely he has a right to go about his job without fear or injury?

‘Too often these days defence lawyers 
are playing the “human rights card” and it is a disgrace. It is becoming
a default setting in solicitors and barristers. This latest case is 
laughable – especially referring to him as a “gentleman”.

‘I don’t know what his lawyer was trying to achieve but she failed rather spectacularly.’

Judge refuses: Judge Roger Thomas QC thought the argument was 'silly' and made some suggestions as he refused the plea

What to wear: Judge Thomas suggested Corkovic use a furled umbrella or wear a flat cap, an accessory even worn by Brad Pitt

Miss Miller made the plea after Corkovic was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of conspiracy to rob a security van.

Earlier this year, Corkovic was jailed
with his uncle, Paul Corkovic, 48, and, Jason McFeely, 39, after they 
were caught planning to rob cash vans following a police surveillance 
operation.

They had been plotting to rob  a 
£90,000 cash delivery from a Stockport supermarket on April 19 and were 
caught armed with a machete and sledgehammers.

Crucially the gang had tried to conceal their faces with ‘snoods’ – a type of scarf – when they were caught by police.

After the sentence, Greater Manchester
Police applied for a Serious Crime Prevention Order, which bans the men
from wearing hoods within 50 metres of shops, banks and cash delivery 
vans, and from travelling in the same vehicle. They are even barred from
wearing false moustaches and beards or possessing any type of face 
coverings in public.

Judge Thomas rejected the arguments of Corkovic and granted the Serious Crime Prevention Order.

Violent plans: The trio were caught with a bag containing this sledgehammer as they prepared for the robbery

Longest-serving armed robber: Also in the bag was a machete, confiscated by police, as Corkovic prepared for the crime which follows other crimes he committed including a a violent £275,000 spree for which he was given a 23-year sentence for

Corkovic, of Salford, who was also 
behind an attempted robbery at a post office in 2010, admitted 
conspiracy to rob and attempted robbery, and was jailed for nine years.

Paul Corkovic – who in 1996 became the
region’s longest- serving armed robber when he was jailed for 23 years 
after a £275,000 spree – was jailed for 18 years.

McFeely was jailed for 13 years.
