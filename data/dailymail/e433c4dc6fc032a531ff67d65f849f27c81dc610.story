Tottenham have been rebuffed in a £15million bid for Real Sociedad winger Antoine Griezmann.

Sociedad want his buy-out clause, £25m, with Monaco and Chelsea also showing interest.

The tricky attacker impressed for France at the World Cup in Brazil, after being thrust into the starting line-up when Franck Ribery was ruled out of the tournament through injury.

Meanwhile, Spurs are pressing ahead with their attempts to sign Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin but manager Mauricio Pochettino may turn to PSV Eindhoven winger Memphis Depay if they fail to persuade Sociedad to sell Griezmann.

Chelsea also have a keen interest in the France international, 23, also and have been watching him closely most of last season.

The Stamford Bridge club have already bolstered their attacking ranks this summer, signing Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa from Barcelona and Atletico Madrid respectively.
