Stuck waist deep in mud, what started as a sunny seaside stroll almost turned into a tragedy for these women and their dog.

They were among three walkers rescued by firemen at the same spot in two separate incidents over the space of four hours.

The drama unfolded in Kent, where storms caused huge mudslides from the clay cliffs. This left large, boggy deposits that crusted over as they dried in the sun, giving the appearance of being firm enough to walk on.

Trapped: This is the terrifying moment two women got stuck waist-deep in a mudslide while walking their dogs in Herne Bay, Kent

Dramatic: Firefighters and members of the coastguard used inflatable equipment to save the trapped pair

Lucky: The dog was virtually unscathed after the dramatic incident. A commuity safety manger said dog walkers should not 'be putting their lives at risk'

However, as these unnamed women found to their cost, anyone stepping on them was in danger of plunging in after a few steps.

In
 the first incident on Sunday, a dog-walker tried to cross the hazardous
 patch between Herne Bay and Reculver at 11.30am with two small dogs 
when it gave way. As the tide rose, she tried desperately to prise 
herself out – but the thick, clinging mud proved too much.

Whitstable’s
 lifeboat was used to ferry ten firemen to nearby shingle from where 
they could lay an inflatable bridge called a mud-path across the 
cliff-fall so they could rescue her without sinking in themselves.

Relieved: The woman comforts her Alsatian-cross after the harrowing experience on the bog in Kent

Separate incident: Hours earlier, a 60-year-old woman got stuck in virtually the same spot after she had taken her dog for a walk

Rescuers rushed to the scene to help the woman who had been walking near Reculver in Herne Bay, Kent

A platform was extended to the woman by firefighters while she lay rooted in the bog

The
 unidentified woman, who was stuck for an hour, was brought back to 
safety with her dogs, which were too light to sink into the mudslide. 
Yesterday, lifeboat helmsman Dave Parry said: ‘It might have looked 
solid enough to walk across, but she got halfway and sank. The tide was 
lapping around her.’

The 
second incident happened at 3pm when two women, one in her 40s and the 
other aged around 70, fell waist-deep after helping their Alsatian, 
which was stuck.

Firemen again used a mud path to rescue them. The pair were treated for shock before taking their dog home for a good bath.
