A plume of smoke blocks out the sun in Wofford Heights, California, as a wildfire rages out of control in and around the Sequoia National Forest

Hundreds of 
homeowners have been evacuated as more than a thousand firefighters 
battle a wildfire ripping across central California.

The
 fire burning in and around the Sequoia National Forest doubled in size 
in 24 hours and came within a mile of a community about 30 miles 
north-east of Bakersfield.

Sheriff's
 deputies walked the streets of the town with bullhorns to wake sleeping
 residents and banged on doors to urge them to escape, authorities told 
the Associated Press.

'They
 were out there walking the streets through the night,' said Forest 
Service spokesman Cindy Thill yesterday. 'I just got off the phone with 
someone who said the sheriffs got to them at 2 this morning.'

Fire crews are facing a race against time to control the fire before hotter, drier weather sets in, she added.

By
 last night, the Shirley Fire had burned through 3.1 square miles (1,984
 acres) of bone-dry trees, grass and chaparral, destroying at least two 
structures, according to fire service spokesman Jay Nichols.

He
 told AP the fire, which broke on on Friday night, was 10 per cent 
contained, despite winds of up to 20mph fanning the flames at mountain 
ridges yesterday afternoon.

Fire
 officials were anticipating a spread towards the evacuated homes in 
Wofford Heights, a community sandwiched between the fire and Lake 
Isabella, a popular leisure spot, he said.

More
 than 1,100 firefighters were working in steep, rugged terrain, aided by
 retardant-dropping air tankers and water-dropping helicopters that can 
fly throughout the night.

More
 fire crews were expected to join the fight.

Humidity expected to stay 
low and wind guests forecast to reach 30mph by Wednesday would 
complicate efforts to contain the fire, according to Accuweather.com,

Authorities
 planned to keep the augmented crews working through a 'swing shift' so 
they don't lose any time during shift changes to make progress, said 
Forest Service spokesman Jennifer Chapman.

'Our
 current outlook for the forecast is such that we are really ramping up 
suppression operations over the next couple of days because it's going 
to be even hotter and dryer at the end of the week,' she told AP.

Camping,
 horseback riding, rafting and other activities in the Sequoia district 
were so far unaffected by the fire, said the Forest Service.
