Children educated at private schools earn almost £200,000 more by their early forties than pupils who go through the state system, a new study has revealed.

Researchers said they had identified the scale of the private school salary ‘premium’ for the first time.

Even after taking into account the ability and family background of pupils, private school pupils earn ‘substantially more’ – nearly £58,000 by their early forties.

The study by the Social Market Foundation think-tank found that private schools tend to be more effective at improving pupils’ results and sending them to university.

Children educated at private schools earn almost £200,000 more by their early forties than pupils who go through the state system, a new study has revealed

The findings prompted calls for leading fee-paying schools to be opened up to all pupils – regardless of their family wealth - using public money.

Emran Mian, SMF director, said: ‘Take two people of the same ability at age 11 and with the same parental background, track them forward, and the pupil who attends independent school is likely to earn substantially more – a total of £58,000 more on average just between the ages of 26 and 42.

‘Our research suggests that a significant driver appears to be that independent schools typically progress the education of pupils more during their school years than state schools.

‘On this basis, limiting the opportunity to attend independent schools to those who are able to afford the high fees seems inequitable.’

The research tracked thousands of Britons born in 1970 and analysed their earnings between the ages of 26 and 42 – the age group it is currently possible to study.

It found that pupils who attended fee-paying secondary schools earned an extra £193,700 between those ages compared with their state-educated peers.

After taking into account test scores at age 10 and a child’s family background, the premium dropped to £57,653.

But the report said: ‘Even once family background and early age test scores are taken into account, those who go to independent schools are more likely to achieve higher salaries in later life, indicating a strong “school effect”.’

The research suggests that private school pupils go on to earn £3,600-a-year more than pupils of the same ability and family background who go through the state system.

Over the course of an entire working life, the premium could exceed £150,000.

Fees for secondary day schools are typically £12,500-a-year.

The report suggested the difference between private and state school earnings diminishes further among pupils who go on to gain university degrees.

But it added: ‘Having been to an independent school does increase later-life earnings above and beyond the fact that it increases the likelihood of achieving a degree.’

It said: ‘Independent school pupils with a degree earned on average about 20 per cent more than their degree-holding state school educated counterparts by age 42.’

The report said that teachers in private schools tended to be better qualified and class sizes were smaller.

They were also better resourced and enjoyed greater freedom from the state.

An analysis of exam results suggested that pupils at independent schools progressed more quickly than similar pupils at state schools.

‘An independent school premium does exist,’ said the report. ‘Some of this is due to the quality of the student intake, but our analysis has shown that a meaningful proportion is likely due to the learning environment provided by the schools.’

The report went on to back a scheme proposed by the Sutton Trust, a social mobility charity, which would involve opening up dozens of top independent schools to pupils of all backgrounds.

Participating private schools would receive the same funding per pupil as local state schools but would also be able to charge fees on a means-tested basis, with the poorest families paying nothing.

Extending the scheme to 100 leading schools would cost £215million, the report concluded.

But the plan has found little favour with the Tory and Labour front benches. Education Secretary Michael Gove has said his focus is on improving state schools.

Sir Peter Lampl, chair of the Sutton Trust, said private schools should be ‘ladders of opportunity’ rather than ‘bastions of privilege’.

In a foreword to the report, Sir Peter said the ‘stark truth’ was that a day pupil at a private school is 55 times more likely to win a place at Oxford or Cambridge and 22 times more likely to go to a top-ranked university than a state educated child.

‘This is a shocking waste of potential,’ he said.

‘This report clearly sets out the advantages that can be gained from a good private education. We need to open those opportunities to more young people, transforming the independent sector to ensure that successful day schools recruit once again on merit rather than money.

‘Forty years ago, most of the best independent day schools in this country were open to children of all backgrounds. Today, unless your parents can find £12,500 a year after tax, access is by and large denied.’

Backing the report, Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The evidence is overwhelming that independent schools confer a massive advantage on their pupils.

‘Rather than knocking independent schools down, we should be opening them up on a meritocratic basis. If we’re serious about establishing ladders of opportunity for the bright kid from the council estate or rural backwater, this is the way to do it.’
