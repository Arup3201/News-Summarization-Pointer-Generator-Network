Scotland and Northern Ireland have been shielded from spending cuts of around £800million because of ‘flaws’ in the formula used to calculate how much public money they should receive.

A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed the unfairness of the so-called Barnett Formula – which decides how funds are distributed between nations of the UK – is getting worse, with every person in Scotland an extra £113 better off than people in England and Wales, and £110 per person in Northern Ireland.

As a result of spending reviews in 2010 and 2013, devolved administrations were spared cuts totalling around £600million in Scotland and £200million in Northern Ireland.

The formula’s creator, Lord Barnett, who died earlier this month, had called for reform of the 35-year-old system, which he said was unfair and out of date. But the Treasury insisted it ‘will continue’.

The report’s author, David Phillips, said: ‘Scotland and Northern Ireland avoided cuts that England and Wales have faced.’

Tory MPs said the report will fuel new pressure on ministers to reform the spending formula which dates from the 1970s. But the Treasury insisted the Barnett formula ‘will continue’.

Former minister Christopher Chope said the report would fuel public anger about the injustice of the formula – and insisted it could not remain in place. ‘What this shows is that the formula is flawed and is not fit for purpose. Any suggestion that it can be left in place unchanged is not going to be acceptable to people in other parts of the UK.’

‘This is one further example of the injustice of it and the lack of transparency.’

‘My constituents are concerned that they cannot get free prescriptions and help with long term care for the elderly and free tuition fees, when these are things that are freely available in Scotland.’

The existing formula, which has been the source of resentment in England for many years, means that public spending per head is £1,623 a year higher in Scotland than in England.

Around two thirds of English MPs want to axe Barnett, including 83 per cent of Conservatives.

But during the Scottish referendum campaign, amid panic about the prospect of a yes vote for independence, all three party leaders pledged to continue using the formula.

Today’s report reveals that technical details in the way business rates are allocated across different parts of the country is making the discrepancy worse.

As a result of the spending reviews in 2010 and 2013, devolved administrations were spared cuts totalling around £600 million in Scotland and £200 million in Northern Ireland, compared to England and Wales,

In the decade from 2000, the flaw was worth some £400million to Scotland – meaning it is now some £1billion higher than it otherwise would be. That amounts to three per cent of the Scottish Government’s budget.

The problem could get even worse, as further taxes when further taxes - stamp duty, land and landfill taxes - are to be devolved early next year.

Ministers are yet to decide how the grants will be adjusted as a result – raising fears it could mean England and Wales are even more worse off.

The report’s author David Phillips, a senior research economist at the IFS, called for the issue to be corrected

‘The Barnett formula looks set to remain in place for some years to come. This appears to rule out a move to a needs-based formula,’ said Mr Phillips.

‘But it makes it more important than ever to examine the Barnett formula to see if it is working in the way intended, and if flaws are found, to fix them.

‘Problems with the way the Barnett formula treats business rates mean that Scotland and Northern Ireland have avoided hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts that they would have faced under a corrected formula - cuts that England and Wales have faced.

‘It is important to get the interaction between devolved taxes and the Barnett formula right. Whatever is decided about which taxes should be devolved, it is crucial to get right the seemingly technical issue of exactly how changes in revenues from those taxes translate into changes in funding.’

The Barnett formula decides how central funds are distributed between the nations of the UK.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland, business rates are fully devolved to the administrations in Holyrood and Stormont, while in England the formula treats them as a contribution towards the Department for Communities and Local Government’s budget for local authorities.

The anomaly means block grants to Scotland and Northern Ireland being cut by much less than the average reduction faced by departments serving England, the IFS said.

Business rates are only partially devolved to Wales at present, with full devolution set to occur in April 2015.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The arrangements for business rates in Scotland and Northern Ireland have been in place since devolution in the late 1990s.

‘Like all other areas of spending, the treatment of local government spending in the Barnett Formula is based on the level of devolution of services, not on individual revenue streams like business rates.

‘The leaders of all three main UK parties have been clear that the Barnett formula will continue. As the report suggests, we will therefore need to put in place arrangements to ensure that neither the UK Government or Devolved Administrations gain or lose from further devolution. 

Ensuring that the risks and rewards associated with decisions taken by the devolved administrations are borne by them, and that mechanisms exist to adjust the block grant accordingly, will be a key consideration.’
