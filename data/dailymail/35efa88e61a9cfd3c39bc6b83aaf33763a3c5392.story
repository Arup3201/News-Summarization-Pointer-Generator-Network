A masked thug has taken to YouTube to threaten boxing champion Amir Khan and crow about allegedly 'knocking him out' when he reportedly attacked the boxer and his brother.

Police are investigating the video which followed reports Khan, 25, and younger brother Haroon, 20, had beaten off six would-be car-jackers in Digbeth, Birmingham, in the early hours of Monday morning.

The pair were allegedly targeted by a gang of six, and the former world light-welterweight champion reportedly knocked one of them out with a flurry of blows, before he and his brother drove away.

Boxer Amir Khan has refused to comment on the claims

In a video posted on social networking sites yesterday a masked man gave his own foul-mouthed version of events and shrieked a series of threats to the Bolton-based champ.

He screams into the camera: 'I'll rip your f****** head off. You know the truth, we know the truth. You got knocked the f*** out.

'Next time you can bring an army. Who gives a f*** if you're Amir Khan. You're not a hero here, you're a zero.'

The video, which looks like it was filmed in someone's living room, came after the reported punch-up in Adelaide Street, Digbeth, when the boxing brothers were said to have been targeted by robbers, who were trying to steal Amir's £100,000 Range Rover.

In the two-part video, the masked man holds aloft belongings including a bag, wallet and car keys, which he claims belong to the former world titleholder.

The footage has led to a West Midlands Police's now investigating the incident, after they originally said they had been called to reports of a disorder but had not found any sign of an assault.

A spokesman said: 'We originally said we are not investigating the alleged incident, but have now revised our position.'

Officers are trying to untangle the details of what exactly happened.

Amir Khan's representative refused to comment on the allegations.

On
the day of the alleged fight Amir Khan tweeted a comment which seemed 
to dismiss the story that he was attacked that said 'silly rumours pple make up.'

He laughed off reports about the attack in a press conference about his future fights the day after the alleged attack, by showing his undamaged hands and face.

The thug, who filmed it in what appears to be a living room, told the boxer that he would 'smash him up' if he came back to Birmingham

Amir Khan was born in Bolton, Lancashire in 1986.

He began to box competitively at just 11-years-old.

The 2004 Silver medal Olympic podium Amir Khan has become Britain's highest-profile boxer

He became the World Light Welterweight Champion in July 2009  after beating Andreas Kotelnik.

In 2007 Khan was convicted of careless driving and given a six-month driving ban and a £1000 fine.

He was punished for hitting and breaking the leg of Geoffrey Hatton in 3006. Mr Hatton was using a pelican crossing in Bolton while Khan was travelling at 47 mph in a 30 mph zone and overtaking in the wrong lane.

Another version of events that night, which reported that the gang were defeated by the Khan brothers, clearly rankled the man on the video, who wore a balaclava to conceal his face while he shrieked into the camera.

He screeched: 'Ask him to explain this: Why have I got his f***ing Porsche keys, you waste, why have I got this Louis Vitton f***ing wallet - it's yours, you waste, and it's got your €500 in it.'

At one point, the man points to video footage of Khan's being hit by Breidis Prescott in 2008 and taunts: 'Look at those legs wobble. Does this man look like he can knock out six men? He looks like a samba dance. Your chin looks big on TV.

'You're not welcome in Birmingham, every time you come we're going to smash you up.'

In an official statement last night, a West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'Police are investigating reports of an alleged criminal incident on Adelaide Street, Birmingham at around 1.23am on Monday, October 8.'

Detective Inspector Dawn Miskella said: 'Police are investigating reports of an alleged criminal incident on Adelaide Street, Birmingham at around 1:23am on Monday 8 October.'
