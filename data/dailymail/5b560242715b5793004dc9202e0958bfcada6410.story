The widow of Chad Littlefield, the friend of American Sniper Chris Kyle who was gunned down at his side, has found happiness two years after the horrific events at Rough Creek shooting range.

As Eddie Ray Routh, 26, begins his life sentence for the murders of Littlefield, 35, and Kyle, 38, who he shot in February 2012, Daily Mail Online can reveal that Leanne Littlefield has remarried and that she and new husband, Texas Ranger Jason Bobo, welcomed their first child, a son, Alex, just last month.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online Leanne's father, retired firefighter Thomas Montgomery told of the family's gratitude at his daughter's second chance at happiness after such devastation, describing her new life as 'a blessing.'

He said: 'She feels very happy with her new life. She's remarried and re-located. We feel like it's just a real blessing.'

He explained that the family's main focus has been on protecting and shielding Leanne and Chad's daughter, Morgan, now 8, from the details of the case as played out in Stephenville Courthouse across the past two weeks.

New happiness: Leanne Littlefield and her new husband Jason Bobo, who she married after the devastating loss of her first husband Chad.

Blessing: Leanna Bobo and her husband Jason posted this picture on social media from their wedding. Her father says her family feels that the marriage is  'a real blessing'

Remembered: Chad Littlefield, his wife Leanne and their daughter Morgan in the picture they used on the program for his funeral

Neither Leanne nor her parents, Thomas and Kit, were present at the trial. Mr Montgomery said he 'didn't see that it would serve any purpose' for them to be there.

He said: 'There are two kiddos to think about now. We know we can't shield her forever. The truth will become apparent in time but for now she knows her daddy is gone and he's in heaven and we just want to protect her as much as possible.'

Leanne, now 36, was just 22 when she married Chad, then 23. Five years later their daughter, Morgan, was born.

The day before he died Littlefield told his parents that his life was 'scary good.' He had a good job; Leanne – then a principal at Walnut Grove Middle School in Midlothian – had a good job. They were financially secure. Life, he said, was 'awesome.'

Then, a few minutes at Rough Creek shooting range, where Kyle and Littlefield had taken former Marine Routh to help the PTSD sufferer assimilate to civilian life, destroyed everything.

It is testament to her strength of spirit that Leanne has managed to rebuild and find a new life and a new love in Ranger Bobo whom she married last summer.

He joined Ellis and Navarro County Rangers in 2010 and IS responsible for liaison with other law-enforcement agencies in the counties.

Last March Ranger Bobo was honored by the US Attorney's office in Dallas.

He was awarded for his investigative assistance in a multi-agency investigation that began as a kidnapping/barricaded subject. A resultant search warrant revealed a street sweeper destructive device, 12 firearms, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, rifle magazines, marijuana, surveillance cameras and $150,000 in cash.

Jason Bobo is a Texas Ranger

According to Mr Montgomery the end of Routh's trial and his conviction is another vital step in the healing process and in moving forward with their new lives as a couple and a family.

He said: 'We feel that the jury was just. I'm no psychiatrist. I mean the guy admitted to doing it and it just came down to what to do with him.

'You know at one time he seemed to be teetering [between sanity and insanity]. Is that cured? Probably not. But we do what the law says and we put him in jail and we keep him there. I don't know if that's good or bad or indifferent.'

Unlike Taya Kyle, whose life has been focused on promoting her late husband's memory through public speaking, book tours and supporting Clint Eastwood's biopic 'American Sniper' by attending the Oscars, Leanne has chosen a different path.

According to her father: 'Leanne's the direct opposite of Taya in personality and I'm not kicking Taya. Taya's a tough old girl. I'm sure she went through some pretty gut wrenching feelings every time Chris Kyle was deployed and she's very very tough.

Proud: Leanne and Jason Bobo welcomed their first son, Alex, with this message on social media

Victim: Famed U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, pictured with his wife Taya, was also shot dead by Routh. The two men had taken Routh to a shooting range to help him with his PTSD when they were killed

Guilty: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was convicted of capital murder by a jury in Texas after just two hours of deliberations on Tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole

'But I hope for her that now this is over she can back off and get her life to calm down some.' 

Mr Montgomery expressed a hope that all the families involved might now find a way towards some sort of peace.

He said: 'I hope everybody can move forward – the Littlefields, the Kyles and even Routh's family because he's got parents and relatives too. I can't imagine how they feel.

'They've got to live with it for the rest of their lives just like the rest of us have to live with our loss all because of the actions of one guy. We're just so grateful for the blessings that Leanne has found.'

The Kyle and Littlefield families have both given their blessing to the passing of a bill that will see a stretch of highway named after Chris Kyle, 38, and Chad Littlefield, 35.

Daily Mail Online can reveal that the families have been assured by senate representatives that the Texas 84th Legislature currently sitting will push through the necessary bill.

The move comes as an online petition to have the stretch of HWY 287, which runs through the men's hometown of Midlothian, named in their honor has gained close to its target 7,500 signatures.

Taya Kyle gave her blessing to the motion last month with the Littlefield family joining her in support shortly before the trial began.

A previous attempt to have the Highway renamed in March 2013 was unsuccessful. But the publicity surrounding Eddie Ray Routh's trial and the release of Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning biopic, 'American Sniper,' has seen a surge of support for the motion.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online Jerry Richardson revealed: 'There had been talk of naming a school after them but a highway seems more fitting to me. Schools can come and go but that road will always be there in their honor.'
