A row has erupted after claims a Russian orphan wrote to Vladimir Putin begging him to allow his adoption by an American family - a move barred by a controversial new Kremlin law.

The plea from Maxim Kargapoltsev, 14, apparently highlighted how dozens of Russian children have had their hopes of a new life in the US crushed by new legislation which has turned them into 'political footballs.'

But Russian officials yesterday denied any letter had been received by the Kremlin.

Plea: Maxim Kargapoltsev, 14, (centre) has asked President Vladimir Putin to allow his adoption by American couple Mil and Diana Wallen of Virginia (pictured)

The boy, who is reported to have a debilitating genetic disease, has communicated with the Wallen family in Virginia for seven years.

He proudly posted pictures of himself with his US 'parents' and is evidently distraught that he has been banned from becoming their child.

His adoption from a grim orphanage in
Chelyabinsk was going through its final hurdles when the Russian 
parliament slapped a ban on all adoptions to America - in apparent 
revenge for new US curbs on visas for Moscow apparatchiks involved in a 
corruption scandal.

Maxim reportedly asked President Putin to 'come out in favour of children,' in his letter

'I
would be very grateful if you come out in favour of children,' said 
Maxim's emotional letter, according to reports disputed by officials.

'Put everything under strict control, but do not deprive children of their right to obtain a family,' he said, 'I beg the State Duma (parliament) and Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin] to approve this adoption.'

In December Maxim posted a map of Woodstock, Virginia on a social site saying with apparentÂ  delight: 'This is where I'm going spend my next Christmas!'

In Tweets before the ban, he wrote to the Wallen's (whose first named are believed to be Mil and Diana): 'I remember you every day! I miss you very, very much!!!' He wrote in November: 'I love you to the moon and back!!!'

The disease from which he suffers was not identified but the US family had agreed to pay for his treatment which is not available in Russia.

'Maxim has strong relations with his American family and I do not think those bonds should be broken,' said Margarita Pavlova, the regional children's rights envoy in the region.

'It is hard to say how the situation will develop from here.Perhaps they will adopt some amendments to the law.' But she warned that Mr Putin was unlikely to bend. 'The probability is very low,' she said.

Loving: In Tweets before the ban Maxim wrote to the Wallen's - 'I love you to the moon and back!!!'

'There
is a chance to treat Maxim in America and the Wallens are willing to 
pay,' she said, 'he could get a good education in that family.'

Denis Matsko head of Maxim's orphanage yesterday claimed the boy did not have a genetic disease. 'He has certain health problems -- just like we all do,' he said.

Supporters of Mr Putin's United Russia Party claimed Maxim was coerced into writing the letter while others said he must have been aided by an adult.

Hopes: In December Maxim posted a map of Woodstock, Virginia on a social site saying 'this is where I'm going spend my next Christmas!'

'This is all being done in order to make Russia look bad again,' said MP Yekaterina Lakhova. 'To provoke a child like that -- I just cannot imagine how someone could do that.'

Kremlin children's ombudsman Pavel Astakhov said the story amounted to 'shameless speculation' and said the US family could still pay for the child's treatment - but could not adopt him.

The US curbs on Russia were imposed after claims that senior officials were involved in a corruption scandal that led to the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow jail, and a subsequent cover up.

Moscow hit back by banning any US adoptions of Russian children. Around 1,000 orphans a year - many seriously disabled - have been adopted by caring US parents and dozens were in the final stages of approval.

Some 60,000 children have been adopted to the US since the Soviet Union collapsed over two decades ago.

Such adoptions are now banned, sparking an outcry that the children involved are now being used as 'political footballs' caught in a diplomatic war between Moscow and Washington. Thousands of Russians are expected to protest the adoption ban this weekend.
