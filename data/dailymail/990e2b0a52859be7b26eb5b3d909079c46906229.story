Cardboard cutouts of lynching victims were found hanging from ropes around the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, apparently linked to protests over the death of Eric Garner.

Three of the effigies were pictured around campus - one hanging from a gate, another from a tree and one on the floor held up by an activist.

The lifesize cardboard figures - which seemed to resemble historical lynching victims from 1911 - was printed with a slogan linked to protests over Eric Garner's death by apparent chokehold at the hands of the NYPD.

Lynched figure: A cardboard cutout of a young man - believed to be 1911 lynching victim Lawrence Nelson - was found on campus at the University of California in Berkeley

Cut-out: Police are investigating the incident, in which another cut-out labelled Laura Nelson was found. It had #ICan'tBreathe written on it - which is a slogan picked up by Eric Garner protesters

Each of the three figures read 'I can't breathe', which are the final words of Garner as he was filmed being taken down and killed by a group of officers.

It was unclear who set up the highly-visible effigies, which appear to have been set up to coincide with a protest event Saturday afternoon.

Police are now trying to establish who is behind the protests - which the university said are likely to have a racial element.

A spokesman for the school told USA Today: 'It certainly could have been racially motivated, so we're taking it very seriously and are very interested in finding out who did this and what the intention was'.

Online: People used social media to share images of the cut-outs. A university spokesman said that racial issues could be at play

Spencer Pritchard, a 21-year-old student involved in the demonstrations, said he hoped the effigies were the work of 'someone who wanted to bring attention to the issue.'

The demonstrations coincided with protests nationwide, where as many as 50,000 protests converged on major cities around the country to protest over police killings of black men.

One of the figures shown on the effigies was named as Laura Nelson, a black woman who was lynched in Oklahoma in 1911, the year written on the figure.

Her 18-year-old son, Lawrence, was also killed after a mob broke into their jail cell and carried them to be hanged. The two were in prison for allegedly shooting dead a sheriff's deputy.
