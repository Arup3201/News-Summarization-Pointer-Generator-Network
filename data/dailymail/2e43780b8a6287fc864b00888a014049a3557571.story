Several UK airports have been selling a magazine which contains an article explaining how to build a bomb while you wait for your flight. 

According to the feature in Wonderpedia, which was written by Evan Booth, 31, from North Carolina, £120 of items can be bought in duty free after passing security which can be used to make explosives. 

It goes on to explain where in the airport you can go to build a suitcase bomb, shotgun and even a crossbow.

Bosses at BAA have ordered the magazine which costs £3.25 to be removed from shelves in WHSmith.

The magazine was also being sold at Gatwick, Luton and Stansted airports.

WHSmith has said it has contacted the publisher about the magazine. 

Publisher H Bauer told The Sun: 'Our aticle was simply an analysis of independent research which had been published on and offline over the last several months. 

The publisher said Wonderpedia acted 'entirely responsibly' because it had edited the original research.
