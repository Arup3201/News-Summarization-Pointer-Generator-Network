St Paul's protesters were handed a two-month reprieve yesterday after the authorities offered to allow them to stay until the New Year.

In a humiliating climbdown, the City of London Corporation said it would abandon legal action against the campers if they leave peacefully in early 2012.

But protesters are already aiming to stay through the Olympic Games next summer – which would guarantee international attention for their cause and embarrassment for the Government.

Hard at work: A protester with a mask of David Cameron on his head cleans the Occupy London camp area outside St Paul's Cathedral.

And a clash between campsite and 
authorities is likely before next weekend, when Saturday’s Lord Mayor’s 
Show will bring tens of thousands of spectators to the City, and 
Remembrance Sunday, as both feature services at St Paul’s.

As late as Tuesday morning the 
Corporation was preparing to hand the camp a 48-hour eviction notice, 
but was forced to change its policy after the Cathedral publicly backed 
the protesters.

Four of the protesters then met 
representatives from the local authority in an attempt to resolve issues
in a non-violent and non-confrontational manner.

Chancellor George Osborne was last night on collision course with Church leaders after it emerged he has serious doubts about moves to bring in a ‘Robin Hood’ tax on bankers.

The European Union tax will hit shares, bonds and currency deals – but bankers fears it will harm London’s position as a financial centre.

As one of the central planks of the protests at St Paul’s Cathedral, the tax is also backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams. He said: ‘There’s an impatience with a return to “business as usual” – represented by still soaring bonuses and little visible change in banking practices.’

But a private letter by Mr Osborne to bank chiefs claims the ‘necessary international consensus does not exist’ to impose the tax.

As part of last night’s deal, the 
City of London Corporation asked protesters to reduce the number of 
tents to enable access to St Paul’s churchyard and abide by health and 
safety legislation.

Tina Rothery, 49, who attended the 
meeting, said: ‘They want a slight but visible reduction of tents, but 
otherwise we can stay until the New Year.

‘I think this is a huge climbdown for
the City of London. At the start of this week it was taking legal 
action to evict us and about to hand us our notice. Now it is allowing 
us to stay until the New Year.’

The offer will now be discussed at 
the camp’s general assembly, which is held twice a day, and with a vote 
on the proposal expected today.

But many protesters have already 
expressed a desire to stay long-term under the cathedral. Camp spokesman
Ronan McNern said: ‘Some of our camp say it should be a permanent 
back-drop and we should be here for the Olympics and beyond.

‘But things are changing so fast that
we can’t really say anything for certain. Guessing at any sort of 
timeframe is something we can’t really do. We’ve had offers of  better 
tents so we can upgrade the camp which would enable us to stay for 
longer.’

The looming difficulty for City 
authorities now is the annual Lord Mayor’s Show next Saturday, when a 
parade of 6,000 people, including a large military presence, attracts 
thousands of spectators.

Mr McNern said: ‘We won’t take the 
tents down for either Remembrance Sunday or the Lord Mayor’s Show but we
will work with St Paul’s.

‘We’ll be provocative but peaceful. 
We want to get people involved but not anything disruptive. We want this
to be a safe space for campers and visitors, and it’s not about 
interrupting the cathedral’s work.’

Protest leaders have met with St Paul's officials to discuss were health and safety and to ensure that upcoming events at the cathedral run smoothly

There are now around 24 Occupy tent protests around Britain.

One such rally is taking place in Bristol, where tents have been pitched on the cathedral-owned College Green for the past three weeks.

Bristol City Council has declared the protest illegal but those on the Green are understood to be ready with a legal challenge if an attempt is made to move them.
