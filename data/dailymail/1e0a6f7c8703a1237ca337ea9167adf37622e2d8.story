Motoring groups accused the Office of Fair Trading of ‘a whitewash’ yesterday after the watchdog ruled out a full inquiry into petrol prices.

The OFT, which launched a probe last year, claimed there was no evidence drivers were being ripped off.

For years motorists have complained that pump prices soar when the price of crude oil rises, but fail to drop if it then falls.

Motorway service stations could be forced to advertise their prices on the hard shoulder so drivers know how much they will be charged before turning off

Drivers pay up to 8p a litre more at motorway services than at other forecourts, the OFT found

But in a surprise decision, the OFT ruled
out a full inquiry – saying there was ‘very limited evidence’ that 
prices were being kept artificially high.

Despite acknowledging ‘widespread mistrust’ by motorists, the OFT ruled ‘competition is working well’ in the petrol industry.

It said price rises were mostly caused by rising crude oil costs and tax rises.

The ruling was slammed as ‘a 
whitewash’ by critics. They said the decision was ‘bitterly 
disappointing’ and ‘a missed opportunity’ to give a fair deal to drivers
by making the issue of fuel pricing more transparent.

FairFuelUK spokesman Quentin Willson 
said: ‘Every motorist and business in Britain instinctively knows that 
something’s not right.

‘UK consumers will be bitterly disappointed. The nation will feel let down. Quite frankly, I’m shocked.’

Road Haulage Association chief 
executive Geoff Dunning said: ‘We asked for transparency but all we got 
was a whitewash. The OFT acknowledges that high pump prices are a result
of high crude prices, not competition.

The Office of Fair Trading said sharp rises in fuel prices was cause by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies

‘So why when the barrel price drops, is that not reflected at the pump?’

And the AA noted that since the start 
of the year, the cost of filling a tank has risen with petrol now 
costing 134.08p per litre and diesel 141.42p.

AA president Edmund King said drivers 
will be ‘bitterly disappointed and frustrated’ by the OFT. He said: 
‘Wholesale price surges that shot up 10p a litre and collapsed just as 
quickly appeared at the pump in days – but took weeks to fall away.’

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said many would find the OFT report ‘hard to believe’.

Pre-tax petrol prices in the UK are amongst the lowest in Europe, the OFT said

But he noted the OFT was right to identify that British motorists pay the highest fuel tax in Europe, at 60p in every pound.

‘The OFT does identify the true cause 
of drivers’ misery – the Chancellor and crude oil prices,’ Professor 
Glaister said. ‘About 60 per cent of the pump price is accounted for by 
fuel duty and VAT.’

The Petrol Retailers’ Association 
‘condemned’ the OFT ruling, which left garages having to ‘explain the 
unexplainable’ to angry motorists on their forecourts.

Tory MP Robert Halfon, who spearheaded
the Commons campaign against rip-off fuel prices, said the scandal 
still needed to be addressed.

He insisted: ‘Whatever the OFT says, 
high prices at the pump are crushing families across Britain. Oil 
companies bear responsibility as well as the Government.’
