RSPCA inspectors investigating an illegal dog fighting racket involving Pit Bull terriers discovered up to six of the animals were being trained to keep fit on a treadmill, a court heard today.

Officers discovered the manually operated running machine along with syringes and scalpels during raids on three properties in East Lancashire where the dogs were seized.

One of the confiscated dogs had a big chunk missing from its ear while another had a head injury. Investigators from the animal welfare organisation examined one cottage and found carpets and wood boards with spatters of blood on them.

Details of the investigation emerged at Hyndburn magistrates court in Accrington where a father and son and a family friend faced a total of 16 charges including causing a dog fight to take place.

Darren Wheatcroft, 47 and his son Callan, 21, who live together at Accrington, are accused of keeping and training three bull terrier type dogs for use in connection with an animal fight, and having various implements, designed or adapted for use in a dogfight. They are further accused of causing an animal fight to take place.

Simon Whitworth, 33, of Oswaldtwistle is charged with causing unnecessary suffering to four bull terrier type dogs named Sheba, Beauty, Dingo and Bebo by failing to ensure they were treated by a vet after being injured. 

He is also charged with having a dangerous dog, possessing implements designed or adapted for use in connection with an animal fight and keep premises for use for an animal fight.

All three suspects deny the charges and face a trial later this year in which 29 witnesses are expected to be called to testify. 

Prosecutor Chris Wyatt told the hearing said RSPCA officers found various dogs during raids on the homes of Whitworth and the Wheatcrofts.

He added: 'There are six dogs mentioned in these proceedings, five of which following a seizure were found to be Pit Bull dogs and banned by the Dangerous Dog Act. The team found possession of items used in dog fighting. A tread mill was found which is used for training dogs.

'This is not like you see in a gym. It is a manual one. There were syringes and scalpels. This is stuff you would not expect to find in a normal persons house.'

Two of the dogs were at Mr Whitworth premises. One had injury to its ear. The other had an injury to its front left leg.

One of the offences alleged against the Wheatcrofts is that they were involved in the arrangement of dog fights due to messages seized from electronic devices.

Whitworth is accused of keeping a premises used for animal fighting. When the team entered the property they found carpets and wood boards with splatters of blood on. It all adds up to being used for animal fighting.

But defence lawyer Alex Rostron acting for all three men told the hearing: 'They have not been training dogs to fight. They say they play no part in that because they did not arrange any dog fights. They are not training them and not fighting them.'

All three men were bailed pending a preliminary hearing at Burnley magistrates court next month.
