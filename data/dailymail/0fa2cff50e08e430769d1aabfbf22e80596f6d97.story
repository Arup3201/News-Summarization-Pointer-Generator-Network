Teenage thug Shawn Tyson was jailed for life for the shocking murder of James Cooper and James Kouzaris.

The pair were gunned down during a botched robbery in the popular tourist town of Sarasota three years ago after stumbling into a rundown housing estate.

Tyson, who was aged just 16 at the time, received a life sentence without the possibility of parole after being convicted of first degree murder.

Killer: Shawn Tyson was sentenced to life in prison for murdering James Cooper and James Kouzaris

In June he launches an appeal against the sentence - and plans to play the race card in a bid to get his conviction quashed.

Tyson is black and 11 of the jury who sat during the week long trial in March 2012 were white.

The jurors in the town which is predominantly white were drawn from a pool of 80 people.

Lawyers for the killer also plan to claim witnesses were offered immunity from prosecution if they gave evidence in the trial.

The prospect of Tyson walking free - or even winning a re-trial - has stunned family and friends of Cooper,24, and 25 year old Kouzaris.

'We thought we had seen the last of this nasty piece of work and it just feels us with horror that he could get the conviction overturned,' said a friend of the Cooper family.

'It is inconceivable that he will win the appeal. I do not think the family of either men will be able to stand it.'

Cooper, from Warwicks, and Kouzaris, from Northampton, had been drinking at a downtown bar in Sarasota when they decided to walk to their holiday home in the early hours of the morning.

Police believe they were drunk and ended up walking through a crime plagued area called Newtown where they were confronted by Tyson whose face was hidden by a bandana.

The teenager had been released from jail hours just earlier for a shooting incident when he ordered the pair to hand over their wallets.

He made them drop their trousers before shooting them dead.

Tyson later boasted to friends that he had "done" the pair and hid the bullet casings and .22 handgun used in the murder.

Police in Sarastoa launched massive hunt for the killer as they feared the negative publicity from the deaths of two holidaymakers would hurt the town's main industry of tourism.

There were no eye witnesses to the shooting, but Tyson was seen in the vicinity of the murder hours before and lived on the estate where it took place.

Although bullets matching those that killed the British tourists were found at his home most of the case against Tyson was circumstantial.

The key evidence came from a former friend who told the court he was asked to dispose of the gun.

Tyson's lawyers plan to tell the Appeal Court in Lakeland that the friend and others who gave evidence had been offered immunity from prosecution for crimes they committed if they gave evidence.

They also say the jury was racially biased against Tyson and he did not receive a fair hearing as he is black.

Prosecution lawyers will argue that the jury reached their decision based on all the evidence that was presented at the trial.

'The verdict was reached without of improper reliance on evidence vouching for the veracity of key witnesses,' said Assistant Attorney General Cerese Taylor.

Tyson, now aged 19, never spoke at his trial and has shown no remorse over the murders.

At the end of the trial two friends of Cooper and KouZaris, who met at university, lashed out at President Obama for failing to make any comment about their deaths.

Paul Davies and Joe Hallett said letters had been sent to Mr Obama but did not get a reply.

They said the deaths of their friends was not worthy of 'ten minutes of his time.'

The rebuke follows Mr Obama's personal intervention into the shooting in Florida of a young black teenager by a white neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman.

Zimmerman was later cleared of murder with his acquittal causing outrage.

Tyson is black, and his attorneys will likely use the predominantly white jury in their client's favor
