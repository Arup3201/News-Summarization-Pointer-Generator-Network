He almost lost his balance when he sat down at the start and briefly lost his composure when someone dropped the F-word but, the subject of Rio Ferdinand aside, this felt like a happy homecoming for Ashley Cole.

Not always everyone’s cup of tea during a Premier League career spent at Arsenal and Chelsea, Cole returned to England for the first time as a Roma player on Monday and was quite the charmer.

There were no hard feelings towards Chelsea for ending his eight-year stay at Stamford Bridge this summer and an acceptance that Italy has yet to see the best of him.

There were even a few wisecracks. When a question was put jointly to him and Rudi Garcia, Cole waited for the Roma coach to finish a long-winded answer in Italian before saying: ‘I agree with him!’

For Chelsea fans who are still coming to terms with seeing Frank Lampard playing — and scoring — against his old club, it will feel even more peculiar to consider the possibility of two of their 2012 Champions League heroes facing one another with different clubs at the Etihad  on Tuesday night.

Asked if he was surprised to see Lampard score four goals in three games for Manchester City, Cole said: ‘Not really. I think everyone knows what Lampard brings to every team.

‘It’s another experienced player for City and he brings goals. He scored one against Chelsea. He probably didn’t like that but he’s paid to do a job.

‘It will be nice to see him but I never expected to play against him. I don’t think Chelsea were wrong (to let them both go). A decision was made and I’m fine with it. I had eight great years there and I still speak to the staff and players.

‘I’m not playing that well. I won’t get carried away. I need more games. I’m enjoying my football and hopefully I can emulate what I achieved at Arsenal and Chelsea.’

Cole will be the most experienced Champions League player on the pitch with 105 appearances, three more than Lampard. But he was left out of the 5-1 win over CSKA Moscow in the opening Group E fixture, as well as one of five consecutive Serie A victories.

One criticism is that he does not get forward from left-back as much as he used to. ‘That’s because I’m old!’ said the 33-year-old. ‘When I get used to the league and the way we play, I’ll attack a bit more. 

Ashley Cole has endured a slow start to his Roma career

‘I’m loving Italy, to be honest. Of course it’s different to the Premier League which is fast and furious. Serie A is slower, though we like to attack and play fast.

‘I loved playing in the Premier League, but this is something different for me now.’

The Italians know that City’s last-minute defeat to Bayern Munich has put more pressure on the Premier League champions to win tonight. Victory for Roma, meanwhile, would put them in a commanding position in the group after just two games.

‘Of course it will make it more difficult for them to qualify,’ said Cole. ‘We don’t want to think that far ahead but it will make it hard for them to catch up certainly and put us top of the group.

‘It’s a new experience for some of our players but we’re confident that we can challenge the top teams, come to City, play well and maybe don’t lose the game — that’s the main thing. I think everyone knows how good City are now. They have been champions twice. They have (Yaya) Toure, (Edin) Dzeko, (Sergio) Aguero, (Joe) Hart and then they sign Lampard.

‘These players are known worldwide because they win things. They have won the Premier League and now they will be aiming to win the Champions League as well.

‘But there is pressure on them. They have big players and I know some of them — Hart and (James) Milner and Lamps — will always want to keep on winning, but there’s less pressure on us.’
