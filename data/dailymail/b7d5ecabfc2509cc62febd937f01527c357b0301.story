Sam Boon (pictured) died in 49C heat when he collapsed and medical aid did not get to him for two hours

A teenager who died in extreme heat during a school expedition to Morocco was being supervised by a rookie instructor, an inquest heard.

Sam Boon, 17, collapsed in front of classmates on a five-day trek in temperatures of 120F (49C).

Newly qualified trek leader Stephen Bates tried to resuscitate him, but failed, the hearing was told.

It took two hours for an emergency vehicle to arrive – and when Sam eventually reached a medical centre he was pronounced dead.

The emergency vehicle was a minivan, rather than a fully equipped ambulance, his father Ken, 55, said before the hearing.

Sam, a student at the Business Academy of Bexley, in Kent, had raised more than £1,000 to join the 17-day trip to Morocco organised by the World Challenge company.

The itinerary was to include a trek to Amezmiz in the High Atlas foothills and a few days helping to build a school.

The cause of his death has not yet been determined but it is thought he may have suffered heat exhaustion.

Yesterday Ben Compton QC, for the Boon family, told Bromley Coroner’s Court that during an assessment, team leader Mr Bates had been advised to stick to an ‘easy lead’ trek becase of concerns that ‘he might have difficulty communicating with young people’.

He asked Sam’s teacher William Pemberton, who helped to organise the trip in July 2012: ‘Would it have concerned you if you had known that Stephen Bates had only recently qualified as a student leader, that  in fact he had never been to Morocco – this was his first expedition?’ 

Mr Pemberton said: ‘Absolutely. We were told by World Challenge that their expedition leaders had knowledge of the areas.’

The inquest heard Sam, who was 
studying for A-levels in maths and physics, took medication to prevent 
bed wetting before he died.

Users of the drug, Desmomelt, must drink no water for an hour before use and limit intake for eight hours.

Sam’s
 mother Karen, 51, said he had suffered from nocturnal enuresis, or bed 
wetting, but this had significantly improved in recent years.

Coroner Selena Lynch asked if he would have told anyone on the trip.

Mrs
 Boon replied: ‘No, not on that trip. He used to carry a couple [of 
pills] in his wallet but he did not  necessarily take them.’

Sam, who lived in Abbey Wood, 
South-East London, was 6ft 2in and over 20st, but while he would have 
been classified as obese his teachers said he was fairly active and 
healthy.

His mother said World Challenge gave little information on fitness training, although the company denies this was the case.

Sam Boon's mother insisted her son, who was 6ft 2in and weighed more than 20 stone, had been physically active ahead of the Morocco trip

She
 said parents had been assured that there was helicopter evacuation 
available for emergencies, adding: ‘I knew it wouldn’t be like it is 
here. But I thought there would be some sort of protective bubble.’

But she admitted Samuel's written application for the trip had not included details of his medication for bed-wetting.

She found three DesmoMelt tablets were missing when his belongings were recovered after his death, the court heard.

'If he took any he would have taken them in the hotel because he was sharing with two other people,' Mrs Boon said.

Eleven
 pupils from the Business Academy in Bexley, south east London, went on 
the trip, and had raised funds to support the expedition.

They had been due to work on a rural project for seven days after the trek, but the trip was cut short after Samuel died.

At the time of his death, temperatures in the region were reported to have risen as high as 49C.

Mrs
 Boon told the court that her son, who was classed as obese with a Body 
Mass Index (BMI) of 36, walked regularly before going to Morocco and 
often played golf with his father.

'He was up for going out with friends,' she said. 'He walked to school every day, which was 20 minutes to half an hour each way, and he walked our dog most days.'

'He was not a couch potato?' coroner Selina Lynch asked.

'No,' Mrs Boon replied. 'We knew he was going to be walking five hours a day. I didn't think that would be a problem with breaks.'

Mrs Boon told the court that a presentation she attended from the trip's organisers had placed an emphasis on safety.

Organisers
 had claimed a satellite telephone, emergency beacons and a helicopter 
evacuation would be available in emergency situations, she said.

Before
 today's hearing, the teenager's father, Ken Boon, said in a statement: 
'Sam collapsed on the second day of the trek and had to wait for two 
hours by the roadside in extreme heat for evacuation, which came in the 
form of a minibus rather than an ambulance.

'Whilst
 the expedition leader and the school staff did everything they could on
 the ground to try to save him, they, along with our son, were badly let
 down and we hope the inquest will answer our questions as to why this 
happened.'

Mrs Boon told the
 court her son, who was studying Maths and Physics A levels, was an 
'easy going, laid back young man' who had previously stayed away at V 
Festival with his friends in 2011.

The inquest continues.
