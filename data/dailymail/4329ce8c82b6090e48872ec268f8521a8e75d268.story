WalMart will have to pay for hundreds of thousands of dollars of groceries bought by Louisiana food stamp recipients after a computer glitch gave them unlimited funds on their government-issued credit cards.

The Louisiana Department of Children and 
Family Services, which oversees the Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card program in the state, said 
WalMart could have instituted an emergency $50 limit for each customer, 
but chose not to - and as a result, the retail giant must foot the sizable bill.

It comes after dozens of welfare families with EBT cards picked the shelves bare in stores in Springhill and Mansfield on Saturday and walked away with up to ten shopping carts filled with meat and other groceries - in a spending frenzy described by local officials as 'worse than Black Friday'.

At 9 p.m. when cards started working again, customers left their carts sprawled out all over the store

Emergency Benefits Transaction cards (EBT) have designated amounts of funds that under-financed individuals can use to buy food each month

When Walmart employees noticed EBT cards weren’t showing spending
limits, they called the corporate office and were advised to allow shoppers to
use the cards anyway. 

Other stores in the towns
 temporarily closed or stopped accepting EBT cards. Wal-Mart instead 
called in police to help control the chaotic crowds of shoppers who 
flooded the store.

'It was definitely worse
 than Black Friday. It was worse than anything we had ever seen in this 
town. There was no food left on any of the shelves, and no meat left. 
The grocery part of Walmart was totally decimated,' Springhill Police 
Chief Will Lyn told ABC News.

Word spread across the towns about the loophole and hundreds of families flocked to the two Walmart stories.

Chief Lyn said he saw some families ring up bills up more than $700. The average monthly food stamp allotment in Louisiana is $136 per person.

'I saw people drag out 8 to 10 grocery carts,' Lyn said.

An entire line of full food carts were left unattended after food stamps went back online on Saturday night

WalMart stands by its decision to let families take advantage of the loophole. A spokeswoman said whatever money the company lost from the spending sprees won't have animpact on the corporate bottom line.

'We did make the decision to continue to accept EBT cards
during the outage so that they could get food for their families,’  Walmart representative Kayla Whaling told KSLA.

The
 lack of card limits was due to a power outage during a routine 
maintenance test by Xerox, an EBT vendor. EBT cards contain 
government-funded amounts of money catered to each individual's 
financial needs.

There were no arrests made that night and witnesses told KSLA that the incident was a 'natural human' response to free food.

Walmart shelves in Springhill, Mansfield were cleared in an EBT glitch and stores were forced to stop selling food

From 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., a frenzy of shoppers filled their carts to the brim with as much food as they could get their hands on.

When the cards came back online at 9 p.m., people abandoned their carts full of food in the middle of the Walmart and left as they didn't have the money to pay.

One woman who tried to ring up $700 worth of food only had .49 cents on her card. She was held by police for ‘stealing’ but was let go on the condition that she would give the food back to Walmart.

After the stampede Walmart had to stop selling food at 9 p.m. Their shelves were stark and both empty and full carts were left all over the store.

A spokesman for Walmart told KSLA that the company continued selling to shoppers 'so that they could get food for their families.'

When asked by KSLA whether or not Walmart would somehow be refunded for the loss of produce, Walmart representative Kayla Whaling responded that they were, ‘fully engaged and monitoring the situation and transactions during the outage.’
