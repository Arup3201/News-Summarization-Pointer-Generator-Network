New rules: George Osborne said yesterday that a basic command of the language would be a condition for receiving out-of-work payments

Benefit claimants who cannot speak basic English will see their handouts docked.

George Osborne said yesterday that a basic command of the language would be a condition for receiving out-of-work payments.

Announcing the new language requirements to MPs, the Chancellor said: ‘From now on, if claimants don’t speak English, they will have to attend language courses until they do. This is a reasonable requirement in this country.

‘It will help people find work. But if you’re not prepared to learn English, your benefits will be cut.’

Around 100,000 people on jobseeker’s allowance and related benefits have worse English than the average nine-year-old, according to official statistics.

They will have to take classes to get up to ‘entry level two’ – the standard expected of the nine-year-olds.

The £100million annual cost of the scheme will come from the anticipated £250million a year saving from making claimants wait seven days – rather than three – before they can receive unemployment benefits.

Lessons to improve the language skills of the workless already cost £50million a year.

The Chancellor’s move in his spending review was the centrepiece of a huge shake-up of the welfare state.

The unemployed will have to attend a job centre every week instead of every fortnight. And jobless single parents will have to start preparing for work once their youngest child turns three.

Treasury officials said they wanted to ‘change the entire mentality’ of job centres. Claimants will have to write a CV and start looking for a job before signing on – rather than the other way round.

Mr Osborne also confirmed a strict cap on welfare payments from April 2015 that will cover housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and pensioner benefits. The state pension will be excluded.

The Chancellor called the cap a ‘limit on the nation’s credit card’ and ‘proof that Britain is serious about living within its means’.

Future governments will have to comply with the cap by cutting benefits – or explain to Parliament why not. The Chancellor also said the Government was considering further restrictions on the right of foreigners to claim benefits.

He said ministers were ‘hemmed in’ by European rules which do not allow them to stop new arrivals claiming handouts.

'Too liberal': Akosuah O'Ansah, with daughter Na'ima, criticised job centres

Akosuah O’Ansah from Ghana fully supports the move to force immigrants claiming benefits to learn English, saying the UK is ‘too liberal’ to foreigners.

The law graduate, who has been living in London since July 1994, was forced to give up her job in banking to take care of her daughter in October 2011.

She said she reluctantly signed up for benefits after finding it was more financially viable than working and paying for childcare.

Now her daughter Na’ima Akansurum is one-year-old, she is keen to get another job.

But she said job centre staff had told her ‘not to worry too much’ about returning to work until Na’ima is three.

Miss O’Ansah, 35, said she thought making job seekers visit the job centre once a week was a good idea because it might persuade them to get a job.

And she said it was important for immigrants to learn English to get their benefits because it would help them to integrate into their community.

She said: ‘Why would you stay here and not want to speak English?

‘England is too liberal, it is like Ghana, it is open to everyone.

‘As an African myself it is quite shocking when you go to the GP and people can’t speak English.’

Former Tory former cabinet minister John Redwood urged Mr Osborne to go further.

He asked: ‘On the welfare reform, would you look at the idea that any non-British citizen coming to our country should have to work for a period and pay taxes before being eligible for any welfare benefits?’

Mr Osborne replied: ‘One of the challenges, and one of the debates we find in this country and other European countries, is about the eligibility to benefits for people who move here.

‘That’s something where we are hemmed in by European law but there may be opportunities within European law to make some adjustments and we are looking closely at those.’

John Cridland of the CBI business group said: ‘It is encouraging to see that Government will have greater control of the welfare budget through the new cap.

'The Chancellor has carefully walked a tightrope of protecting growth, while making sizeable savings to pay down the debt.’

Richard Hawkes, of the disability charity Scope, said: ‘Disabled people will be extremely concerned about the cap on welfare.

‘After £28.3 billion of cuts, disabled people can’t bear any further squeezes on their living standards.’
