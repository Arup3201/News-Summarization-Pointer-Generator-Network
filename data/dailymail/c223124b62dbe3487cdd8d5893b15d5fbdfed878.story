People with homes in the infamous ‘Tornado Alley’ live in fear of the destruction that can be wreaked by devastating twisters.  

But one scientist thinks states in the centre of the U.S. could be protected from destructive storms, by erecting three giant walls.

The physicist said that the walls, which would measure 1,000ft (300m) tall, could stop the flow of air from north to south to prevent the formation of tornadoes, but a number of scientists are sceptical about the idea.

One physicist thinks states in centre of the U.S. that lie in the relatively flat area of 'Tornado Alley' could be protected from destructive storms by erecting three giant walls

A tornado, or 'twister', is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cloud.

Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches Earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust.

The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300mph (483 kph), stretch more than two miles (3.2km) across and stay on the ground for dozens of miles, or more than 100km.

Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica.

However, the vast majority of them occur in the Tornado Alley region of the U.S. - they can occur nearly anywhere in North America.

An F5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers.

Rongjia Tao, of Temple University, Pennsylvania, told USA Today: ‘If we build three east-west great walls in the American Midwest....one in North Dakota, one along the border between Kansas and Oklahoma to the east, and the third one in south Texas and Louisiana, we will diminish the tornado threats in the Tornado Alley forever.’ 

To support the vast height, the walls could have to be around 150ft wide and the magnitude of the structures would be enough to weaken flows of air that are responsible for the formation of the deadly twisters, Dr Tao will explain at the American Physical Society in Denver next week.

The largest of the storms in Tornado Alley are formed from violent clashes between warm northerly flows of air and cooler southbound air.

Huge tornadoes form in the region as it is relatively flat from the Dakotas to Texas with no mountains to disrupt this flow of air and weaken it.

But giant walls could potentially solve this problem and cripple the air currents, according to Dr Tao.

However, not all scientists agree that his idea could be effective.

Rongjia Tao of Temple University, Pennsylvania, proposed the building of three east-west great walls in the American Midwest (illustrated), which he claims will 'diminish the tornado threats in the Tornado Alley (shown by the orange ring) forever'

Tornado researcher Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla told USA Today that Dr Tao’s idea simply ‘wouldn’t work’.

He cited China, which has plenty of mountains as an example of why not, as the country has deadly tornadoes despite its east to west mountain ranges.

Dr Brooks said: ‘This is essentially a case of a physicist, who may be very good in his sub-discipline, talking about a subject about which he is abysmally ignorant.’

The project would also be incredibly expensive with walls potentially costing $60bn for 100 miles, according to Dr Tao’s estimates.

Meteorologist Mike Smith of AccuWeather Enterprise Solutions dismissed the plans for the walls as ‘nonsense’.

He said: If supercell thunderstorms with F-5 tornadoes could laugh, they would have a hearty chuckle as they “attacked” the wall. If tornadoes can go up and down mountains (and they can!), they would go over/through the wall.’

The aftermath of a tornado in Oklahoma last May, which killed 24 people and destroyed 1,200 homes. While scientists are keen to find ways of curbing nature's destructive power, a number of experts have dismissed Dr Tao's idea of erecting giant walls in 'Tornado Alley' as 'nonsense'
