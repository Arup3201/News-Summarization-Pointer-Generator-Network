Dramatic footage following the Sunday shooting of a New Hampshire man shows his devastated fiancée overcome with the news he was dead after an armed attack on his home, possibly at the hands of his own brother.

Jen Lord’s unthinkable trauma managed to get even worse as fiancé Eddie Hoffens’ brother and roommate David told a friend ‘he shot the guy and was afraid that he also shot his brother Edgar’ before being hauled off by police for tampering with evidence.

That 'guy' was the brothers’ reported attacker Charles Cable and both he and Eddie are dead. And while the two Manchester brothers have a history of discord, with David pleading guilty last month to threatening to kill Eddie, the 21-year-old repeatedly told police he ‘didn’t mean to do it.’

Wrenching: Jen Lord of Manchester, New Hampshire is inconsolable in dramatic photos taken after she learned of the shooting death of her fiance Eddie Hoffens

Devastating: Initial reports indicated that Jen Lord's fiance was gunned down by his own brother during an armed attack on their Manchester, New Hampshire home

According to Jeffrey Hastings, the photographer who took the wrenching photographs, police took David Hoffens, 21, into custody after he ran from the scene and disposed of a gun.

Hoffens had allegedly just been involved in a confrontation that left both his brother and an attacker dead at their Lake Avenue home.

Charles Cable, 20, was found face down outside the home in a puddle of blood. He would later die at a hospital.

According to the Union Leader, Eddie Hoffens, 22, would be declared dead on arrival after he was found at the base of the home’s stairs Sunday just before 4pm.

Victim: 20-year-old Charles Cable, pictured, was killed when he apparently came to the Hoffens' home armed for an attack. Cable has a history of run-ins with the police and was himself stabbed some 10 times in a May attack

David’s confessor and childhood 
friend Eric Woodard said he called Eddie’s phone Sunday and Lord 
answered, too overcome to even speak.

It
 was when he contacted David that he learned the scope of the tragedy. 
Woodard told police that’s when David said he ‘shot the guy and was 
afraid that he also shot his brother Edgar’ after ‘the guys’ pulled  a 
knife on him.

Initial reports suggested that David accidentally shot Eddie during an armed confrontation with Cable at their home.

However,
 complicating the case are an additional admission of guilt from Dan 
Morgan—boyfriend to the brothers’ mother Cynthia Hoffens—and a history 
David has of threatening his older brother.

Morgan told police he is the one who 
accidentally shot Eddie while he was pointing the gun at Cable. He 
claims it was David who shot Cable.

But just last month, David pleaded guilty to threating to kill Eddie.

‘I’ll slit your throat,’ he admitted to telling his brother.

No
 one had been charged in the homicides as of Monday afternoon, but David
 was arrested and charged with tampering with evidnce by detectives who 
found him at an area bakery.

David
 admitted to investigators that he’d fled the scene on foot and ditched 
the gun and holster. The holster has since been recovered.

According
 to the Union Leader, David also admitted to obstructing justice after 
threatening to kill Eddie by ripping phone lines from the wall so he 
couldn’t call 911.

David and Eddie’s sister Samantha Hoffens took to Facebook in her jailed brother’s defense:

‘We
 are trying to get 2500$ to get David out on bail. If anyone can help 
please let me know. I will also be trying to put together a fund for my 
brothers funeral. Thank you.’

Hectic: The scene that developed at the Hoffens' apartment after the 4pm shooting was chaotic as investigators tried to make sense of the situation. At left, police take a statement from an unidentified man

Two dead: Cable was rushed to the hospital after he was found bleeding from the head but breathing. He later died at an area hospital. Eddie Hoffens was pronounced dead on arrival

Awaiting charges: Despite the graveness of Sunday's apparent crime and police assurances there is no public danger, no one had been charged for the murders as of Monday evening

For his part, the late Charles Cable has also has a history of encounters with the law.

At the time of his death, Cable was waiting to be tried for charges he assaulted his girlfriend and and her mother in October.

Cable
 was on the other side of the law back in May when he suffered as many 
as 10 stab wounds during an early morning knife attack.

David Hoffen’s bail was set at $25,000 and a probable cause hearing set for December 5.

Plot thickens: Police must now put together the pieces in an increasing confusing plot line. Despite David's purported confession to a friend, his mother's boyfriend also admitted to police that it was he who shot Cable

Gory: Both victims were found outside this  home on Sunday. Eddie was dead at the scene and Cable died later at a hospital after he was found face down in a puddle of his own blood
