Boss: BG Group had been planning to pay chief executive Helge Lund (above) a £12million 'golden hello' on top of his annual pay of up to £13million

The major energy firm which proposed a £25million pay package for its new boss has scaled back the deal following shareholder outrage – to around £18million.

BG Group had been planning to pay chief executive Helge Lund a £12million ‘golden hello’ on top of his annual pay of up to £13million.

But following mounting criticism and the prospect of a revolt over the deal, the firm has been forced to cut this back.

Because of new targets tied to the firm’s financial performance against industry peers such as BP and Shell, the company estimates that he will now receive around £4.7million from the welcome package instead of £12million.

A vote on the deal, which had been planned for two weeks’ time, has also been scrapped because the new package is in keeping with the company’s existing pay rules. 

Had the vote gone ahead, it was likely the company would have suffered an embarrassing defeat.

Four of its largest investors had criticised the deal publicly, with several major pension advisory groups also coming out against it.

‘The board should never have put shareholders in this position,’ said Martin Gilbert, chief executive of fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management – one of BG’s top ten investors. 

‘We were very surprised the board chose to give him these awards in the first place.’

Pressure is now increasing on the company’s pay chief, Sir John Hood, to step down. Sir John, the former Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, concocted the original pay package. 

He gets £153,000 a year for his part-time role, which includes leading the remuneration committee.

BG has admitted it used ‘expert’ pay consultants when setting pay levels, but a source added: ‘The remuneration committee is ultimately responsible for pay matters, including this package.’

BG, which was demerged from British Gas in 1997, admitted it had been forced into the decision. A statement said: ‘The board believes that Mr Lund is an exceptional candidate. 

'However, a significant number of shareholders questioned the structure of the package. Both the board and Mr Lund recognise and wish to respond to shareholder concerns.’

BG was previously accused of ‘blackmail’ by shareholders after warning that Mr Lund was not obliged to join the firm if investors did not support the £12million package. 

Yesterday it confirmed that he would be joining, despite his awards being scaled back.

The move was widely welcomed by business leaders who had previously criticised the pay deal. 

The Institute of Directors applauded the climbdown after describing the initial package as ‘excessive and inflammatory’.

Simon Walker, the IoD’s director general, said: ‘While substantial, the total remuneration now falls within proper limits for a company of BG’s size and international importance.'
