A Tory MP yesterday branded his accuser ‘vindictive’ and called for a change in the law after a rape case against him was dropped by police.

Mark Pritchard, 48, said he was maliciously targeted by a former lover and called for those accused of rape to be allowed anonymity until they are charged.

The MP for The Wrekin said the law on sex offences – which grants alleged victims anonymity but not the accused – should be reviewed so that ‘fairness plays a greater role’.

Anyone who makes an accusation that they are the victim of a sexual assault is given anonymity for life, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

But the same protection is not granted to the alleged perpetrator.

Critics claim the system is unfair because it allows innocent suspects to have their reputation dragged through the mud.

But the Government has defended the system - with many MPs arguing that naming suspects has often encouraged other victims to come forward, helping to convict attackers who may otherwise have escaped justice.

David Cameron today said there were ‘real issues’ with rape suspects anonymity.

He said: 'I think it needs very careful thought before going down that road.'

But the outspoken backbencher could face a fresh police inquiry after revealing sensitive details that could identify the woman who accused him.

Among his remarks, Mr Pritchard disclosed that the pair were in a ‘consenting’ relationship, described the woman as ‘single, well-educated’ and gave her approximate age.

Senior figures in the criminal justice system will take a dim view of Mr Pritchard’s actions if they threaten to discourage other women from contacting police.

Last night Scotland Yard refused to be drawn on whether the politician has broken the law but a spokesman said it would ‘assess’ any complaint carefully.

Mr Pritchard’s ordeal began in early December when he attended Holborn police station in Central London and was arrested over the rape claim.

Speaker John Bercow published details of the arrest in a Commons daily order paper.

But after six weeks on bail Mr Pritchard – who divorced his wife Sondra in 2013 – was told yesterday he will face no further action as there is not enough evidence.

Speaking outside the House of Commons, Mr Pritchard claimed the woman had ‘concocted a vindictive and outrageous story’.

‘To be falsely accused of anything is an awful thing,’ he said. ‘Sadly, as an MP, sometimes you have a target on your back. Of course she remains anonymous. The law on anonymity does need to be reviewed and fairness does need to play a far greater role in these cases.’

Mr Pritchard is a prominent member of the Tory Right and a leading Eurosceptic who was secretary of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers

Mr Pritchard, MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire, was arrested and questioned by police on Tuesday following an allegation that he raped a woman earlier this year 

Mark Pritchard is one of Parliament's most-colourful MPs – a self-made businessman who grew up in an orphanage before entering the Commons in 2005.

The Tory backbencher is one of the party's most Eurosceptic MPs and admitted that he came close to joining UKIP earlier this year.

Since his election almost a decade ago, Mr Pritchard has been involved in a series of high profile political clashes – including with the Prime Minister.

During the 2005 leadership election he asked David Cameron if he had ever taken a Class A drugs.

He was also briefly the toast of the Tory backbenches after taking on Commons speaker John Bercow – shouting at him that he was 'not f****** royalty'.

He added: ‘The last few weeks have been a testing time. I’m glad it’s all over.’

Victims of rape and other sexual offences were given anonymity under the 1976 Sexual Offences Act.

Government ministers, prosecutors and police chiefs are desperate to encourage victims of sex crimes to come forward. New figures are expected to show that the number of rape cases going to court has risen significantly after years of decline.

Legal expert David Banks said Mr Pritchard’s comments will be examined closely and could land him in court. ‘Regardless of the outcome of any police inquiry or prosecution, anyone who makes an allegation of rape is entitled to anonymity for life,’ he said.

‘Any comment that identifies the victim to anyone by revealing specific details is potentially a breach of the law.’

He added: ‘The Crown Prosecution Service has been quite aggressive in pursuing that kind of publication as it could put off others from coming forward.’

Mr Pritchard’s call for those accused of rape to be granted anonymity has re-ignited a long-running debate.

He was backed by fellow Tory MP and former Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans, who was cleared last year of a string of sex offences.

Mr Evans said: ‘Sex crimes have a special stigma … I know the weight that will have been lifted from his shoulders … that has been progressively crushing him for the past six weeks.’

But Downing Street made it clear the Government is unlikely to revisit the issue after a 2012 review found it could interfere with the judicial process.

Speaking on local radio, Prime Minister David Cameron said it ‘needs very careful thought before going down that road’.

Last year, Mark Pritchard and his estranged wife became embroiled in a row on Wikipedia over who was to blame for the break-up of their marriage.

In July 2013, Sondra Pritchard, wife of Mark Pritchard, allegedly used the website to accuse her husband of 'abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage' even though he claimed to be a 'devout Christian'.

Under 'spouse' it refered to his wife by her maiden name of Sondra Spaeth and added that divorce was pending.

Shortly afterwards the entry was deleted. But a tit-for-tat Wiki war ensued as the account of their split was changed on the MP's profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events.

Most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the Houses of Parliament where both worked at the time – Mrs Pritchard as her husband's Commons office manager.

Even more remarkably, some of the anonymous Wiki entries appeared to involve a code which echoed opera buff Mr Pritchard's role as treasurer of the Parliamentary opera group.

One of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as Figaro2000, after Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro.

In a statement, he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her 'in person'.

He said: 'I informed my ex-wife, in person, that I was going to file for divorce the day I left home. Over subsequent days, I confirmed that decision through another conversation, a legal letter, and by text.

'Since then, friends claim she may have abused the Wiki site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims. I did not edit any item on my Wiki page.'

The 'text' claim was added to Mr Pritchard's profile on August 1: 'The couple separated in April 2013, following Mr Pritchard, a devout Christian, abandoning Sondra and the marriage on 29th April by text.'

Mr Pritchard's fightback started on August 6, when allegations against him were deleted by Figaro2000.  

The only mention of his wife of the Wikipedia page now reads: 'In July 2013, Mark Pritchard announced that he was divorcing his wife of 15 years, Sondra, following their separation in April 2013.'
