Under fire: Sony executive Amy Pascal, pictured at LAX on Saturday, hopes The Interview will save her job

One particular email conversation between Ms Pascal and Hollywood film producer Scott Rudin appeared to mock Barack Obama.

The emails, initiated by Ms Pascal, suggested that the President would prefer movies such as Django and 12 Years A Slave and films starring black actors.

Another set of emails released saw Ms Pascal call Hollywood actor Adam Sandler an 'a**hole'. 

The Sony Pictures Chair addressed her work situation as she touched down at Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday.

When asked by photographers if the u-turn on the decision to not to release The Interview would 'be enough to save your job', Ms Pascal replied: 'I hope so', the New York Post reports.

Digital demand: James Franco and Seth Rogen are shown in a still from The Interview that has found success with online sales and rentals of $15 million

The Interview took $15million in online rentals, and also hauled in $2.8million from 331 theaters since opening on Christmas Day with $1.8million taken in over the weekend.

The political comedy starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, who also co-directed and co-wrote, was set for a wide release on Christmas Day on about 3,000 screens but was given a limited release in the wake of the Sony Pictures cyber attack.

Sony also made the movie available onine via YouTube, Xbox Video and Google Play.

The Interview has been rented or downloaded more than two million times since being released online on Tuesday, according to an article on Sunday by Variety.

It quickly became Sony's highest grossing online release ever.

The Interview also surpassed other recent video on demand success stories such as the Chris Evans post-apocalyptic drama Snowpiercer that has earned $7 million on demand.

'I'm so grateful that the movie found its way into theaters, and I'm thrilled that people actually went out and saw it,' Rogen said in a statement.

'We are very pleased with how it is doing both theatrically where we are seeing numerous sell-outs across the country, and online where it remains at the top of many charts,' added Rory Bruer, Sony's president of worldwide distribution.

However, Sony appears to have taken some security measures regarding the film, after it was revealed that  producers cut a scene depicting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un participating in a gay orgy.

The scene was described in a version of The Interview's script released in the hack attack in November, but did not appear in the film.

Sony staff who spoke with The Sunday Times called the version released last week a 'redacted version' and expressed hopes that the full unedited movie would be released on DVD in a 'director's cut version'.

Sony initially decided not to release The Interview after an alleged cyber attack by North Korea on their internal system on November 24. 

Hackers released several upcoming Sony movies as well as personal details of thousands of employees and the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity.
