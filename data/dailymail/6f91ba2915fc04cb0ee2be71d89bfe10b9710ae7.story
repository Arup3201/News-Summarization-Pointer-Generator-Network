An elderly couple were attacked in their home by a pair of machete-wielding thugs while they watched television. 

The 70-year-old pensioner - who wished to remain anonymous - was punched repeatedly in the face and his wife, 69, was also threatened with the large blade.

The raid took place in Birch Avenue, Chadderton, Oldham, on Tuesday evening while they were watching television at about 6.20pm. 

The elderly couple - who wish to remain anonymous - were attacked as they watched television on this road

When the pensioner opened the door to his house in Chadderton, he was punched repeatedly by the offender 

When the couple heard the doorbell ring, the husband answered the door and was confronted by two men who forced their way in to the house. 

The pensioner tried to push the offenders out the door but was punched by one repeatedly in the face. He was left with a bloody lip and shoulder injury.   

Hearing the disturbance, his wife ran to his aid into the hallway of the £200,000 property. 

By this point, the offenders were half-way up the stairs and were seen holding a machete. The thugs demanded to know if the couple had a safe, and threatened them with a blade. 

The wife managed to run from the house, screaming for help and both offenders fled in panic, empty-handed.

The first offender was described as black, about 6ft 2in tall, well-built and in his mid-20s. He had prominent eyebrows, a large nose, and was wearing a dark grey woollen hat with a black scarf around his face.

His accomplice was also black, about 5ft 8in tall, in his mid-20s with a slim build. He was also wearing dark clothing and was carrying a stainless steel machete said to be about 18 inches long, three inches wide and with a slightly curved walnut handle.

Police are now appealing to anyone with information to come forward.

Det Con Kelly Bragg said: 'The motive for this appalling attempted robbery is unclear. We cannot be certain if it was a case of mistaken identity or for whatever reason the offenders have deliberately targeted this address.

'What is for certain is that an elderly couple have been left extremely traumatised after the sanctity of their home was invaded and they were violently assaulted. For those reasons it is imperative we locate the offenders as soon as possible.

'I would therefore urge anyone who has information about this incident, or perhaps know who may be responsible, to call us and help us put these dangerous offenders behind bars.'

Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
