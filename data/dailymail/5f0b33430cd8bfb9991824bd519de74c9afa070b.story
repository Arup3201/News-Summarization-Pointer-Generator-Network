David Cameron dramatically played the patriotic card yesterday by accusing Ed Miliband of trampling on the rights of the English by blocking ‘home rule’ measures for England.

In a move designed to upstage the Labour conference, which started on Friday, the Prime Minister raised the stakes in the bitter war of words that has raged since the Scottish referendum.

Mr Cameron called on Mr Miliband to drop his opposition to Tory plans for ‘English votes for English laws’ to match devolved powers for Scotland, which have been promised now the Scots have voted to reject independence.

He accused Labour of ‘overriding’ the rights of the English and Welsh – and warned it could lead to a fierce backlash.

Mr Cameron called on Ed Miliband to drop his refusal to back Tory plans for ‘English votes for English laws’ to match devolved powers for Scotland, which have been promised after Scots voted 'No'

The provocative move came as a Mail on Sunday poll showed big support in England for Mr Cameron’s home rule measures.

English voters say the three party leaders were ‘panicked’ into a last-minute pledge of more cash for Scotland because they feared Alex Salmond and the Scottish Nationalists were heading for victory.

Labour reacted furiously to Mr Cameron’s new attack on Mr Miliband. They believe his ‘English votes for English laws’ plan is a Tory trap – because it would mean scrapping the voting rights of 41 Scots Labour MPs at Westminster, potentially wrecking Mr Miliband’s hopes of forming a government.

In effect, Mr Cameron is turning the row into a personal battle with Mr Miliband to prove which of them stands up for England. 

In a hard-hitting article for today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Cameron says: ‘The challenge to Labour and Ed Miliband is clear: either resolve this issue with us, or explain to the people of the rest of the UK why they shouldn’t have the same powers as we are devolving to the people of Scotland – why, for instance, Scottish MPs should be able to vote to vary income tax rates in England, when the Scottish Parliament is going to be setting Scottish income tax rates in Scotland.’

A Labour aide accused Mr Cameron of ‘cynicism’ – and said his package of measures had been ‘drawn up on the back of a fag packet’.

But Tory chiefs are convinced they have forced Mr Miliband on to the back foot with the surprise move to tie extra money and home rule for Scotland to similar measures for England and Wales. Labour MPs have waded in, claiming Mr Miliband must do more to show he is ‘pro-English’.

In a message aimed directly at Mr Miliband, Mr Cameron writes in The Mail on Sunday: ‘Millions of people in the rest of the UK have been asking: “Why can’t we have the same powers and rights as Scotland?”

‘Why should Scottish MPs be able to vote on English schools, English hospitals, English or Welsh income taxes, when English or Welsh MPs would have no say in such matters in Scotland? It is fundamentally unjust to have the views of the people of England and Wales overridden in this way.

There was a ‘crying need’ for England and Wales not to be discriminated against, he argued, adding that if the rights of the English and Welsh were trampled on it could lead to serious trouble.

The ‘English question’ was ‘a basic unfairness at the heart of our democracy’ – and must be put right.

Mr Cameron will host an ‘English votes for English laws’ summit at his official country residence Chequers tomorrow. 

He has invited senior Tory MPs including John Redwood, who has led the campaign for a new English Parliament, and Conservative grandees Peter Lilley and Bernard Jenkin to discuss the issue with Cabinet Ministers Michael Gove and William Hague.

Mr Salmond yesterday claimed Mr Cameron had already started to go back on his vow to give Scotland a better deal, saying people had been ‘tricked by Westminster into believing there would be an immediate offer of extra powers… and within 24 hours of the polls closing they start to tear up the commitments.’

The Tory-Labour feud came as it emerged Alistair Darling is poised to quit politics after being upstaged by his old boss Gordon Brown in the ‘No’ campaign. The former Labour Chancellor says he will decide soon whether to resign from his Edinburgh seat at the next Election.

Alistair Darling led the No camp to victory in Thursday’s referendum, but was eclipsed in the last days of the campaign by Mr Brow

Mr Darling led the No camp to victory in Thursday’s referendum, but was eclipsed by Mr Brown, whose passionate oratory was credited with winning over wavering Yes supporters. 

It was particularly galling for Mr Darling, 60, who until a few weeks ago had barely been on speaking terms with Mr Brown since falling out over how to handle the economic crisis when they were in power.

Asked if he would stand again, Mr Darling – who has been tipped for a possible return to the front bench in a reshuffle later this month – said: ‘I am making my mind up.’

The news came as Mr Brown gave another barnstorming speech in which he promised to force Westminster to stick to its promise of extra devolution for the Scots – and dispelled any speculation about his own future by saying that he was ‘too old to be the comeback kid and too young to be an elder statesman’.

Mr Brown, 63, said ‘the eyes of the world’ were on the party leaders in Westminster over the pledge to give the Scots greater devolution.

‘These are men who have been promise makers and they will not be promise breakers,’ the former Prime Minister said.

Mr Brown said a draft Scots Home Rule Bill would be ready by ‘in time for Burns Day’ – January 25 – but it cannot become law until after next year’s General Election.
