The Church of Scientology ran a 
60-second commercial in several major metropolitan markets including New
 York and Los Angeles during Super Bowl XLVII on Sunday causing a stir 
among viewers.

‘To the curious, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,’ an unseen narrator says in the commercial while attractive, intelligent-looking people gaze directly into the camera. ‘To the ones who just want to know about life, about the universe, about yourself.’

The controversial religious institution aired a shorter 30-second version of its ‘Knowledge’ spot in select cities during the AFC Championship two weeks ago. The video ran on television for the first time more than a month ago.

Odd appearance: The Church of Scientology ran a 60-second commercial in several major metropolitan markets including New York and Los Angeles during Super Bowl XLVII on Sunday

On-air proselytizing: 'To the curious, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge,' the commercial's an unseen narrator says. 'To the ones who just want to know about life, about the universe, about yourself'

Knowledge is power: The spot is part of the Church's new 'Knowledge' campaign, encouraging its members to take certainty in themselves

The organization paid close to $8 million to air the spot during the big game, which is the largest one-day televised event in terms of ad spending.

The ad features young actors as well as images of libraries, caverns, scriptures, outer space, and a mysterious-looking fortuneteller stroking a crystal ball, among other cryptic scenery that runs over soft, hypnotic music.

The spot that aired during the Super Bowl, entitled ‘Knowledge,’ was actually published on the Church’s YouTube page in December, but hit the mass market last night.

As of Monday morning, the video has nearly 89,000 views. The ad is in-line with one of the core beliefs of the religion, which include knowledge, responsibility, and control.

Within the past month, the controversial organization has uploaded nearly two dozen videos, many of them tours of different branches of the Church across the country.

More ads were broadcast during other prime time events this year, like the Golden Globes, Miss America pageant, and the NFL playoffs leading up to the Super Bowl.

‘Not cute questions, big questions, one’s that matter,’ the unseen narrator says. ‘To the rebels, the artists, the free thinkers and the innovators who care less about labels and more about truth.’

The ad is similar to Apple's classic 'Think Different' commercial from 1997, media observers noted, using the same basic format, a deep-voiced male narrator, and slow, inspirational music.

Representatives from the Church told MailOnline that it has been running television spots since 2009, with this particular ad debuting on the religion's website in November 2012.

A spokesperson said via email: 'As a matter of policy, we do not disclose the ad budget. However, we are very happy with the interest that the ad has generated.'

The reaction on Twitter and other social media sites was one of mockery, with several jabs from people in the video game industry.

'If your church has an ad during the Super Bowl it's stops becoming a religion and starts becoming a punch line'  Kevin Dent, chief operating officer of the mobile video game network P4RC  wrote on Twitter after the spot ran.

'Hey America, if The Church of Scientology has enough cash to advertise during the Super Bowl, maybe it shouldn't be tax exempt,' IGN.com editor Scott Lowe wrote.

The general consensus on social media was one of confusion, amusement, and wry entertainment. One Twitter user, @JoshCharles, wrote: ‘good game but so-so commercial (sic)… like the bud light stevie wonder and cars. Com wolf one. But scientology? What?’

But everyday viewers weren’t the only ones poking fun at the spot. Bill Maher wrote: ‘I saw an ad for Scientology, I joined, and then Destiny’s Child reunited! That s*** works – thanks, Tom Cruise!’

Doree Shafrir, the executive editor of Buzzfeed, tweeted: ‘Love how everyone in LA thinks the Scientology ad was local. Nope, THEY’RE COMING FOR ALL OF US.’

The Church of Scientology and its network of corporations, non-profits and other legal entities bring in more than $500 million a year from the organization's paying members and other revenue sources according to a 2008 report in Upstart Business Journal.

The church is run like a franchise, as each of its locations is separately incorporated and has its own local board of directors and executives responsible for that church's activities and financial operations.

The first Scientology church was incorporated in December 1953 in Camden, New Jersey, by the religion's founder L. Ron Hubbard, his wife Mary Sue Hubbard, and their colleague John Galusha.

Hubbard, a science fiction writer, said at that time, 'A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology.'

The church's current members include several celebrities. Among them are actors Tom Cruise, Jason Lee and Juliette Lewis, rapper Doug E. Fresh, musician Beck and television host Greta Van Susteren.

The organization has come under fire in recent years for alleged accounts of bigotry, deceptive means of recruitment and smear campaigns against its opponents, among other reported violations.

The Scientology commercial's YouTube page, which went live on December 18, had just 60,000 views as of Sunday night, compared with more than 7 million views for Volkswagon's much talked about 'Get Happy' Super Bowl commercial, which was posted on YouTube last week.

Original run: The controversial religious institution, which some have compared to a cult, aired its 'Knowledge' spot in select cities during the AFC Championship two weeks ago

Closing words: 'In the eternal debate for answers, the one thing that's true is what's true for you' the commercial's narrator concludes

To the curious. The inquisitive. The seekers of knowledge. To the ones who just wanna know. About life. About the universe. About yourself. Not cute questions. Big questions, ones that matter. To the rebels, the artists, the free thinkers and the innovators. Who care less about labels and more about truth. Who believe non-conformity is more than a bumper sticker. That knowledge is more than words on a page. You're young. You're old. You're powerful beyond measure and the fuel of that power is not magic or mysticism, but knowledge. The things you see. The things you feel. The things you know to be true. Sure, some will doubt you. Let 'em. Dare to think for yourself. To look for yourself. To make up your own mind. Because in the eternal debate for answers, the one thing that's true is what's true for you.
