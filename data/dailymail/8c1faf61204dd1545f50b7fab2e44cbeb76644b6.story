Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign after a flurry of abusive text messages sent to his paying fans.

In appalling texts seen by Sportsmail, the Seasiders’ chief has called one fan a ‘retard’ and told him to ‘enjoy the rest of his special needs day out’.

Oyston could now face an FA investigation, even though he sits on the Football League’s board of directors.

Supporter Steve Smith was labelled a 'retard' and ‘intellectual cripple’ by Oyston, whose beleaguered side lost 6-1 at home against Bournemouth on Saturday and are bottom of the Championship.

One rant from Oyston, who had abuse hurled at him as well, read: ‘Stop texting f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium.

‘You are banned because I think you are a p****.

‘Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.’

Oyston has also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: ‘I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission’.

Smith wants the FA and Football League to take action.

‘The texts are disgusting, politically incorrect and show that Karl needs to be put through the fit and proper person’s test. Let’s not forget he is supposed to be a figurehead in football,’ he said.

‘Karl treats this club like a cash cow and has no interest in what happens on the pitch. I did a radio interview recently and the presenter told me not one person rang in to support Karl.

‘His position is untenable. He’s been untouchable for years and the FA haven’t done anything about his actions.’

Ismail Kaji, who has a learning disability and works for the charity Mencap, said that the ‘disgusting’ language made him ‘sick’.

‘I would feel ashamed however to support any football club that has a chairman who uses such disgusting language to people with a disability,’ he said.

‘This language is just as bad as using racist or homophobic words. There is no difference and it makes me sick.’

The FA say they are ‘aware of the matter’ while the Football League offered no comment. Blackpool were unavailable for comment.
