From witnessing the breathtakingly beauty of the Guerrero mountain range to getting food poisoning in Morocco, David Brain experienced more than just feats of brilliance while filming World’s Most Talented.

The 31-year-old co-host of the interactive talent show, which will be broadcast for the first time tonight, travelled to India, Mexico, Italy, Argentina and Morocco and caught up with four people from each country.

His first stop on the tour was India, a place he ventured through on planes, trains and bikes and described as ‘crazy on every single level’ – a billing that stunt couple Mr and Mrs Budati certainly lived up to.

Filmed in the middle of a jungle, Mr Budati demonstrated his outrageous ability to rest a coconut on his wife’s throat and slash it in two with a machete, leaving her entirely unharmed.

Discussing the stunt, David Brain told MailOnline Travel: ‘The local village came down to watch the event and all of them were really calm – I was this flappy English bloke who wasn’t sure about it.

‘I was genuinely worried. My facial expression as it is seen on the show was real.’

According to Mr Budati, he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm – a state of mind every Indian competitor seemed to possess, remarked David.

Serenity was also a theme in Argentina, where David got to witness what would retrospectively become one of his favourite performances of the series – Gaucho cowboy Martin Tatta  performing horse yoga.

‘Martin Tatta was one of my favourite performers for personal reasons – I’m a bit wary of horses,' said David.

‘His relationship with the horse was just so good, so calming. He uses no equipment and never uses violence or a whip, the bond is created by total respect and trust – it was a real moment.’

The London-based presenter even admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself, he would have chosen Mr Tatta’s, as the skill would impress his partner – a horse enthusiast.

‘It would have to be the horse yoga, even though there are things that were definitely cooler. She [his partner] would be pleased if she came in and saw me with one relaxed on the floor,’ he said.

‘Also, I like the idea of serenity and chilling out, especially as I live in London, and Martin’s performance was the purest moment of utter serenity.’

Despite the moments of tranquillity experienced on the trip, David also endured his fair share of turmoil and a bout of food poisoning in Morocco certainly took its toll.

David said: ‘We filmed India and Morocco together and I was careful that everything was piping hot and that I wasn’t going to eat meat in India – I was militant.

David described Aziz Salhi as a real showman and was impressed by his strength and ability

The presenter noted that the road had been closed and 500 people had turned out to witness Aziz Salhi's show of strength

‘So when I got to Morocco I felt like I had survived India and paid a hefty price for playing with the rules. All I’m saying is don’t have the Caesar salad in Casablanca.’

Morocco however did bring about some of David’s favourite moments and he recalls going to visit strongman Aziz Salhi, who holds off accelerating cars and keeps hold off accelerating motorbikes.

‘He was one of my favourite spectacles – a real showman. He told us that he had spoken to the government and that they were shutting down the roads for his stunt.

‘We were dubious, but we drove to the place and there must have been about 500 people, which included police and motorbike gangs outside the town hall.

David was impressed by the youngster's showmanship and stated that he had a 'Christina Aguilera level of attitude'

‘There was a lady there who must have been about 700-years-old, her son, or grandson, [the performer] wheeled her to the front and there were motorbikes doing wheelies next to her – I thought she was going to pass out.

‘Their crowd control was motorbikes doing doughnuts. Health and safety would never allow that to happen in the UK, but no one was hurt.’

Moving on to Italy, David found more excitable people and none encapsulated the sentiment more than father and son team Antonia and Vincenzo Scapicchio, the pizza freestylers.

‘Italy is a really nice place,’ said David, ‘the people look like they have walked out of a beauty advert.

Not sure what to make of it! David admits that he was slightly confused by the pizza freestylers' act

‘And in the middle of all these young and hip people is a man and his son, who eat a lot of pizza, throwing pizza dough.

‘It looked like they were stripping. I thought I was having some weird dream. Part of me felt like it was the best thing I had ever seen and the other part was thinking what are they doing?

‘The kid was really working the camera though, with a Christina Aguilera level of attitude.’

David’s visit to Mexico also brought about its fair share of interesting characters, and the country itself had a profound effect on the presenter.

He said: ‘At first I was annoyed that I was going to Mexico instead of Sweden. I am marrying a Swedish girl and she was saying that I know the country and could do a good job there.’

‘But Mexico was so much fun. It was a place that really got me. Not so much Mexico City, but when we travelled to Acapulco we drove through a mountain range and it was just stunning, absolutely gorgeous.

‘People say it’s dangerous but I didn’t experience any of that, just very nice, friendly people.’

David’s meeting with Eduardo Flores while in Mexico, however – a man who head-butted a nail into a piece of wood – was less easy on the eye.

‘He was there banging his forehead on this nail. I held it and it was definitely a nail,' said the presenter.

‘He was smashing concrete blocks up with his fist, and at the end he was really pumped and grabbed and shook my hand. When I took my hand away it was covered in blood.’

Other performances that caught David's eye during the series included a man named Khivraj Gurjar, who performed bike yoga while perched precariously from the side of a mountain in India.

Describing the temperature as ‘hotter than the surface of the sun’, David explained how Mr Gurjar was completely serene as he balanced from his BMX.

David enjoying himself by having a few midday drinks with breakdancing group Impacto Crew  in Mexico

A breakdancing group called Impacto Crew, who the presenter admits getting slightly drunk with in the midday Mexican sun, also evoked fond memories for the presenter.

'There were 40 people doing shots of Tequilla, singing songs and dancing. It was a crazy atmosphere but the acts were fantastic,' said David.

However, not all performance went entirely to plan over the course of the series and a number of incidents saw proceedings become momentarily stalled.

The performance of a young limbo skater called Gagan Satish resulted in some off-screen controversy with parents complaining that their children were not picked in place of the youngster.

Young limbo skater  Gagan Satish was eventually able to perform after an argument momentarily hampered the show's progression

'They were shouting at one another and driving their cars away to prevent him from performing,' recalls the presenter.

Nature also played its part, with heavy rain in India temporarily hampering archer Jayalakshmi Sariknoda hopes of competing on the show.

While rain and wind in Argentina halted the progression of tightrope walker Sebastian Petriw.

In the end however all the performances were completed, and given the complexities involved, the filming of the show was ultimately a success.

World’s Most Talented with air tonight at 9pm on Watch and the first episode will see India compete with Romania for the coveted crown.
