The Tour de France begins in Yorkshire on Saturday with British hopes firmly resting on the shoulders of Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish.

Froome is aiming to defend the overall winner's yellow jersey - or maillot jaune - having triumphed in the 100th edition of the race last year, while Cavendish is targeting regaining the green points jersey, awarded to the best sprinter, which he won in 2011.

Here Sportsmail takes a look at the main competitors for the yellow, green, polka dot (King of the Mountains) and white (best young rider) jerseys.

Ready: Sky employees from Leeds unveil the world's biggest jersey ahead of the 2014 Tour de France

Geared up: Yorkshire will host the Grand Depart, with Froome looking to retain his yellow jersey

Yellow jersey (general classification winner) contenders

Chris Froome (Team Sky, 10-11 favourite)

Speculation surrounded whether or not 2012 winner Bradley Wiggins would feature in Team Sky's squad for the Tour in the build-up to the race but he has been left out and 'Froome-dog' has the nine men he wants to mount his bid for glory.

Froome is odds-on to deliver his second - and Team Sky's third - yellow jersey on the spin, with his all-round ability placing him ahead of the pack.

The 29-year-old's versatility on the climbs and in the time-trial stages should give him the edge but, although he won the Tour de Romandie for the second consecutive year, he has suffered from injuries and illness recently that could wreck his chances.

Favourite: Team Sky's British rider Froome has a great chance of retaining his yellow jersey

Versatile: Froome (in yellow) is strong at climbing as well as time trials, which should give him the edge

Mentor: Froome (right) with Team Sky team principal Dave Brailsford during the 2013 Tour

Absent: 2012 Tour winner Bradley Wiggins (centre) was not selected by Team Sky

Alberto Contador (Team Tinkoff-Saxo, 6-4)

Two-time Tour winner Contador finished fourth in last year's edition following a return from a two-year drugs ban but he has won both the Tour of the Basque Country and the Tierro-Adriatico already this season.

The Spaniard will surely be Froome's main challenger and will push him hard in the mountains.

Threat: Spain's Alberto Contador is Froome's most likely challenger in this year's Tour de France

Vincenzo Nibali (Astana, 10-1)

The 29-year-old Italian is an accomplished climber and, with Grand Tour victories in the Giro d'Italia (2013) and Vuelta a Espana (2010) already under his belt, Nibali is experienced.

A win here would give Nibali a full set of Grand Tour wins and he will have to perform exceptionally well in the mountains to deliver that.

Experienced: Italian Vincenzo Nibali is looking to complete his set of Grand Tour wins

Alejandro Valverde (Movistar, 14-1)

The 2009 Vuelta a Espana champion has returned to form in recent months and the unusually versatile Spaniard - he is a strong sprinter as well as a strong climber - could spring a surprise.

Form: Movistar's Spanish rider Alejandro Valverde has been getting back to his best recently

Andrew Talansky (Garmin-Sharp, 33-1)

American Talansky won the young rider classification white jersey in 2013 and has followed that up with a Criterium du Dauphine victory this year.

It is probably too soon for the 25-year-old but he is a dark horse for this year's race.

Outsider: US rider Andrew Talansky of Team Garmin-Sharp is a dark horse for the general classification

Green jersey (points classification winner) contenders

Peter Sagan (Cannondale, 8-15 favourite)

The Slovakian has competed in two Tours and won the green jersey on each occasion so it is hard to look past the 24-year-old.

He is not just a pure sprinter but is very strong on long stages and can climb a bit too, meaning he is always there or thereabouts when it comes to collecting points on a stage.

Always in green: Slovakian Peter Sagan is looking to win his third straight points classification

Marcel Kittel (Giant-Shimano, 9-2)

Kittel won the most stages last season and the German looks to be the new sprint sensation.

He is an out-and-out sprinter though so will have to rely on stage wins if he is to take home green.

Raw pace: German sprint sensation Marcel Kittel won the most stages during last year's Tour

Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-Quick Step, 5-1)

The same applies for Cavendish who will need to gather as many stages as possible - starting with the Grand Depart on Saturday in Yorkshire which could see him wear yellow for the first time ever too - if he is to regain the jersey he won in 2011.

Cavendish out-sprinted Kittel in the Tirreno-Adriatico earlier this year but they have barely competed aside from that so it will be interesting to see if there are any psychological scars left over from last year.

The 29-year-old Manx rider has a team built to deliver him stage wins so Cavendish could upset the odds and walk away with green.

Regain: Manxman Mark Cavendish is hoping to win the green jersey he first claimed in 2011

Rivalry: Cavendish (left) and Kittel (right) will be competing for sprint stage wins this year

Sprint king: After struggling a little last year, Cavendish is hoping to return to the top of the charts

Andre Greipel (Lotto-Belisol, 14-1)

The German leads the stage victory rankings for 2014 with 11 already this year but is often overshadowed by Cavendish and Kittel. He will struggle to hold off his most consistent competitors.

Quick: German Andre Greipel has already won 11 stages so far this year and could claim the sprinter's jersey

Alexander Kristoff (Katusha, 16-1)

Not a sprinter but more a stage rider. He had a brilliant spring, dominating the classics, but tends to come into his own after long, arduous stages with sprints at the end. Difficult to see the Norwegian gaining enough points.

Unusual: Norwegian Alexander Kristoff is more of a stage rider than a sprinter in reality

Polka dot jersey (King of the Mountains) contenders

Alberto Contador (Team Tinkoff-Saxo, 7-2 favourite)

Chris Froome (Team Sky, 4-1)

Rivalry: Froome (right) or Contador (left) will likely claim the Kings of the Mountains jersey as well

Pierre Rolland (Team Europcar, 9-2)

Rolland seems the most likely to claim the polka dot jersey outside of the big two. The Frenchman won the white jersey in 2011 and he claimed the 19th stage of that race at the summit of Alpe D'Huez, highlighting his climbing credentials.

Joaquim Rodriguez (Katusha, 6-1)

His climbing prowess has brought him ten Grand Tour stage victories, as well as the mountains classification in the 2005 Vuelta a Espana. At 35 he may be starting to show signs of aging but he is still capable of claiming the stage wins necessary to bolster his chances.

Thomas Voeckler (Team Europcar, 12-1)

Unusually Team Europcar have two riders more than capable of claiming the King of the Mountains jersey. Frenchman Voeckler won this jersey in 2012 and always performs well at his home race so he could deliver once more.

Pride: Frenchman Thomas Voeckler is hoping to claim polka dot jersey glory for his home nation

White jersey (best young rider winner) contenders

Thibaut Pinot (FDJ.fr)

A disastrous end to last year's Tour seems to have fuelled the Frenchman and if he shows his true form he should claim the white jersey. Prone to an implosion though, so by no means guaranteed.

Romain Bardet (Ag2r-La Mondiale)

Stage wins may be more likely for this strong climber but, as another French hope, the home crowd will be cheering him towards a high general classification finish.

Second fiddle: Pole Rafal Majka will ride for Team Tinkoff-Saxo's leader Contador at the Tour

Rafal Majka (Team Tinkoff-Saxo)

The Pole led his team at the Giro this year and finished in white there and could do so again. However, he may have to sacrifice his own position for team leader Contador and that may cost him.

Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-Quick Step)

Another Pole with big ambitions but his form has let him down. Kwiatkowski seriously struggled in the Dauphine and will need to find some extra pace from somewhere if he is to challenge.

Jon Izaguirre (Movistar)

An extreme outside shot to win, but Izaguirre will hope to follow Valverde and possibly shoot up the rankings alongside his fellow Spaniard by doing his donkey work in the mountains.

Unlikely: Spaniard Jon Izaguirre is an extreme outside shot to win but could claim the white jersey
