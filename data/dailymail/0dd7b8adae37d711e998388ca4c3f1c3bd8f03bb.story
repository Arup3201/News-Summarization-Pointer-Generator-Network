Norman Baker, pictured last year, is rebelling against civil servants' order that he must be chauffeur-driven between his office and the House of Commons

When politicians are embroiled in rows over Government chauffeurs, it is usually because they have abused the privilege.

But not so colourful Home Office Minister Norman Baker, who is rebelling against an order to use a driver by demanding that officials provide him with a ‘ministerial bike’ instead.

The Liberal Democrat, whose appointment to Theresa May’s team was the biggest shock of the autumn reshuffle, says civil servants have told him he must be chauffeured the quarter-mile between his desk at the Home Office and the Commons.

When he told them that he would rather pedal and asked them to provide a bicycle, they refused – on the grounds that it would be an ‘unacceptable burden’ on the taxpayer.

Last night, Mr Baker hit out at what he described as a ‘ridiculous, Yes Ministerish jobsworth’ attitude. 

‘I object to the fact that they are trying to put me into a car with a chauffeur against my will,’ he said.

‘I pointed out that it would be much quicker and cheaper for me to cycle. But they said that while the car was already paid for, providing a bike would be an additional cost to the taxpayer. It’s nonsense. 

‘It would be cheaper and also better for the environment.’

Mr Baker, 56, added: ‘I could provide my own bike, but I regard it is a matter of principle.’

It is understood that the row has gone all the way to Sue Gray, the  Cabinet Office’s Director General of Propriety and Ethics, who has backed the officials.

And last night the Home Office, which spends £136,000 a year on chauffeuring its Ministers around, was sticking to its guns.

One of Mr Baker’s own spokesmen said: ‘Ministerial travel is governed  by the Ministerial Code, which states that arrangements must be efficient and cost-effective.

The Minister said he would rather cycle the quarter-mile distance between his desk at the Home Office and the House of Commons (pictured)

‘Providing bicycles would mean additional and unnecessary cost to the department when arrangements are already in place. For short journeys, and where practicable, Ministers can walk or use public transport.’

Mr Baker’s appointment was surprising because he once wrote a book claiming British spies covered up the death of Dr David Kelly, who exposed Tony Blair’s ‘dodgy dossier’ on Iraq.

However, sources say relations between Mr Baker and Mrs May are ‘surprisingly cordial and pragmatic’.
