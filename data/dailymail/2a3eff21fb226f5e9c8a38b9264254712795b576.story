Indonesia declared its independence from the Netherlands on August 17, 1945 in one of the first acts of post-war decolonisation.

The colourful independence celebrations draw upon the many traditions of Indonesian culture, including bizarre tests of agility and strength.

During World War II Indonesia had been invaded by Japan and following their surrender Indonesian nationalists declared independence.

Initially, the Dutch resisted the nationalists, holding onto the country they called The Dutch East Indies.

The Dutch tried to resist the independence movement, eventually accepting defeat after four years following pressure from the United Nations.  

One of the most bizarre parts of the Indonesian independence celebrations is the Panjat Pinang competition where men clamber up greased poles 

The Panjat Pinang game was introduced to Indonesia by the Dutch colonists, who placed prizes at the top of the pole during special occasions for entertainment 

Because the poles are covered in grease or oil, one man is unable to clamber up unaided as they are unable to grip and climb at the same time 

As a result, the men form teams where they help each other on the understanding that they split the goodies from the top of the pole equally 

In an amazing feat of strength, one man grapples with the base of the pole while his friends use him as a ladder to get to the goodies from the top

This man is guiding down a brand new bicycle which has been lowered from the top of the pole by a team mate who managed to scramble to the top 

In some cases, two or three men will stand on each other's shoulders as they defy the laws of gravity in a bid to unhook the prizes from the top of the pole

As well as bicycles, which are generally the top prize, other gifts include electronic goods, and even food

Women and children look on from the ground and cheer on their friends and relatives as they try and dislodge the goodies from the top of the pole 

The men have to co-operate with each other to work their way up the pole, here one of the men wraps his arms and legs to anchor himself, allowing his friend to climb

One of the biggest celebrations is in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, which also features a flypast by members of the Indonesian airforce 

Here one man stands on his friend's head, while on the right a man tries to climb over his friend who is gripping on half-way up the pole 

In a remarkable display of dexterity, this man uses his feet to lower this full-size adult's bicycle from the top of the pole so it won't be damaged 

The poles are nut trees which are chopped down in advance of the celebration and loaded with gifts and secured upright 

The independence celebration is a major day out for Indonesian families who decorate buildings and homes in the red and white national colours 

The Panjat Pinang competition is designed to teach young people the importance of working together for the common good 

But some Indonesians believe that because the tradition was introduced by the Dutch colonists it should be banned as it is demeaning 

A more recent objection concerns the large number of nut trees which are chopped down in advance of the celebration  

The Dutch colonists introduced the tradition in the 1700s for their own amusement where they would place trinkets at the top of the greased poles

Unsurprisingly, the strongest man is positioned at the bottom of the human pyramid while the lightest, most agile climber makes his way to the top

For those Indonesians who are unable to clamber to the top of a greased pole, another competition involved competitors eating crackers 

Women are not allowed to participate in the pole climbing competition, but they are allowed to take part in a special sack race which is also very popular 

Other competitions involve a marble and spoon race, where participants grip a metal spoon with their teeth and walk while balancing a marble 

Another bizarre game played on independence day is cone football, where players cover their faces with a cone and race around after the ball
