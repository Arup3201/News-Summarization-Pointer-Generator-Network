South Africans of all races, ages and political persuasions paused for six minutes and seven seconds this morning to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela on the first anniversary of his death.

Across the country crowds gathered to ring bells, sound sirens and blast vuvuzelas before observing several minutes silence in a touching tribute to his 67 years in public service.

It was a time to remember his struggle against white-minority rule and also to reflect upon the country's failure to capitalise on the freedom he fought for.

Veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle lay wreaths at the foot of a statue of Mr Mandela in Pretoria and crowds sang 'Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika' (God Bless Africa), the adopted national anthem.

There was a worldwide outpouring of grief when South Africa's first black president died a year ago from a lung infection aged 95.

Mr Mandela, also known by his clan name of Madiba, spent 27 years in prison for fighting white-minority rule in South Africa.

US President Barack Obama paid homage to the former leader saying that his life will impact the paths of generations to come.

'One year ago the world lost a leader whose struggle and sacrifices inspired us to stand up for our fundamental principles, whose example reminded us of the enduring need for compassion, understanding, and reconciliation, and whose vision saw the promise of a better world,' Mr Obama said.

'As we pause today to remember the legacy of Madiba, I hope we can all take a moment to reflect on how Mandela's life has inspired our own, and will impact the paths of generations to come - including the next generation of world leaders, as while Mandela left behind a world more just and free, there is much more work to be done.

'On this day, and on every day, we honour his spirit and his memory.'

Fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu called on South Africans to emulate Mr Mandela's example.

'Our obligation to Madiba is to continue to build the society he envisaged, to follow his example,' said Archbishop Tutu. 

'A society founded on human rights, in which all can share in the rich bounty God bestowed on our country. In which all can live in dignity, together. A society of better tomorrows for all.'

Official ceremonies to mark the passing of the former  leader will include an interfaith prayer service and a cricket match.

Over the weekend, artists and performers will hold centre stage at the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which has launched an exhibition in honour of the life and work of its namesake.

Motorcyclists across the country have also been called on to dedicate their traditional Sunday morning rides to the anti-apartheid hero.

One of his granddaughters, Ndileka Mandela, said South Africans were still upholding Mandela's legacy and honouring his memory by living by his values of peace and reconciliation.

'That's just the spirit of who granddad was, that even after a year that he's gone peace still prevails, people still upholding his legacy and what he stood for, because he stood for peace and reconciliation,' she said.

The anniversary has also given people the chance to reflect on the disappointing pace of change since 1994 and vent frustration at President JacobZuma and his ruling African National Congress (ANC) party.

'This moment should call upon us to pause and to reflect on
the life of South Africa's greatest son,' said Acting President
Cyril Ramaphosa, standing in for Zuma who is visiting China.

Ephraim Mabena, 55, a veteran of the anti-apartheid armed
unit Mr Mandela helped set up, called him an inspiration and a
legend, saying: 'The sad part is that he is no longer with us.' 

Twenty years after the leader he swept the ANC to power, pledging to
ensure universal access to quality education, jobs and houses,
very little of the optimism that engulfed the country remains.

'Mandela was in a different struggle. The current leaders
are in their own self-serving struggle,' said student Paballo
Nalane, 23, in a crowd at Nelson Mandela Square in Johannesburg.

A quarter of the working population - and 60 percent of the
youth - is without a job. Society remains starkly unequal,
fuelling crime and social unrest, and confidence in Zuma's
leadership is at an all-time low.
