A schoolgirl is feared to have become the youngest victim of a super-strength ecstasy-style drug that has claimed up to ten lives this year.

Ellie Jones, 16, suffered breathing difficulties at a friend’s house and died in hospital less than 90 minutes later.

Yesterday police revealed that traces of PMA – also known as pink ecstasy – had been found in her system. The drug, nicknamed Dr Death, is sold to revellers for as little as £3 a pill.

Ellie Jones, 16, died last Saturday after developing breathing difficulties while at a friend's house. She is believed to be the ninth victim of the drug 'Dr Death'

It resembles ecstasy but can be five times as strong. However it takes longer to have an effect, prompting some users to take more pills – and unwittingly give themselves a fatal overdose.

Detectives investigating Ellie’s death have arrested six people, including three boys aged 16, on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs and perverting justice. All have been freed on bail.

Officers are also working closely with schools, colleges and drug agencies to warn youngsters about the dangers posed by PMA.

Ellie collapsed at a friend’s house in Warrington at about 3.30am last Saturday. Paramedics treated her at the scene. She was taken to hospital but died shortly before 5am.

Although PMA was found in her system, it has not been confirmed as the cause of her death.Derbyshire Police are already investigating four deaths linked to the drug.

They include Rachel Clayton, 34, and her partner Emma Speed, 30, who were found at their home at Macclesfield last month, and student Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, who died in January.

Ellie is believed to have taken the super strength form of Ecstasy which can cause dangerous increases in body temperature. Paramedics tried to save her life but she died in hospital

The deaths of five people over the Christmas and New Year period in a 60-mile radius of Manchester were also linked to PMA.

Cheshire Police Superintendent Martin Cleworth said: ‘We have a duty to warn people about the potentially fatal consequences taking this drug can have, and would urge people to obtain urgent medical assistance on behalf of anyone suspected to have taken PMA who suffers difficulty breathing, muscle spasms, nausea or starts to vomit.

‘If anyone has any information about who may be supplying this fatal drug, I would urge them to contact police, so we can continue to do all we can to remove them from our streets and prevent anyone else going through the heartache Ellie’s family have gone through.’

Ellie attended St Gregory’s Catholic High School in Warrington, where headmistress Noreen Fawkes said her death  had had a ‘profoundly sad effect’ on everyone.

In an online tribute, one friend, Chloe Ford, posted: ‘She never failed to make someone laugh’.

Another, Ruth Ann Collopy, wrote: ‘Don’t think I ever saw her around school without a smile on her face! RIP Ell.’

PMA has also been linked to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Norway and Denmark.

The pills – often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and stamped with a McDonald’s-style M – are made from a different amphetamine from that used in ecstasy.

Cathy Fitzgerald, from Warrington’s Drug and Alcohol Action Team, said: ‘Drugs have a big effect on people’s health and wellbeing and so we would strongly advise not to take any illegal drugs or “legal highs”, as they all come with great risk.

‘If you or someone you are with find yourselves suffering from the symptoms of this drug, it’s vital that you seek medical attention straight away.’

The deaths of Charlotte Woodiwiss (left), 20, and of Jordan Chambers (right), 19, are also being blamed on 'Dr Death'

Gareth Ashton (left), 28, and Dale Yates (right), 18, are also thought to have taken the drug before they died

‘Dr Death’ tablets are often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and have the chemical name PMA, they are a type of amphetamine known as Paramethoxyamphetamine and are also referred to as 'Mitsubishi Turbos', 'Pink Ecstasy', or 'Pink McDonalds'

Tributes have been left outside Ellie's home and police are working with schools and colleges in the area to educate people about the dangers of taking 'Dr Death'

'Dr Death' has been linked to eight other deaths in the UK as well as to deaths in Canada, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. Picture shows a tribute left outside Ellie's house
