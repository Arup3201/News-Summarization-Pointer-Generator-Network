MPs are blocking a plan by Speaker John Bercow to install a ‘bullying helpline’ for Commons staff amid fears it would be swamped by the volume of complaints.

The proposal followed a string of allegations about MPs shouting, swearing, hurling staplers and sacking staff by Post-it note.

The Mail on Sunday has learned Mr Bercow is also investigating claims that sexual harassment is ‘out of control’ at Westminster, with staff too frightened to blow the whistle in case it jeopardises their job prospects.

Thwarted: Commons Speaker John Bercow attempted to close a loophole so MPs' staff could complain about bullying, but he was voted down at a recent meeting of the House of Commons Commission

A complaints procedure already exists for officials employed directly by the Commons – but it does not apply to MPs’ staff. When Mr Bercow suggested closing the loophole at a recent meeting of the House of Commons Commission – its supervisory body – he was voted down.

Sources say MPs from the three main parties insisted they could not meddle in the relationship between MPs and their staff.

But one said: ‘The employment thing is a fig leaf. If you set up a helpline it would be absolutely inundated. Do you know what this place is like? It would be carnage.’

Talk of MPs mistreating staff is rife, with some said to get through ‘dozens of employees’ because of their tempers.

Mr Bercow has also asked, discreetly, for information about sexual harassment in the Commons, having been told there might be a ‘problem’ with some high-profile individuals.

One union official said last night: ‘The problem is, MPs are judge and jury. If there’s bullying or other misbehaviour, staff have to complain to the MPs themselves.’

In the thick of it: MPs have allegedly shouted, sworn, hurled staplers and sacked staff by Post-it note
