The idea of free-falling off a 100m cliff would be a petrifying thought for most of us.

But not for French tourist and avid climber Vladimir Lennert, who was excited at the prospect of swinging off the famous Hanging Rock in Blue Mountains National Park, 50 km west of Sydney.

The 21-year-old was joined by three other friends two weeks ago as they jumped 10m and swung off the famous cliff while overlooking the scenic valley views.

When Mr Lennert spoke to Daily Mail Australia about his experience, he seemed unfazed.

'We were just looking for something to do on our rest day so we decided to do this just for fun,' he said.

'It's an awesome place to be rope swinging with a really nice view. It's not too scary if you don't think about it too much. So it's not a big deal.'

Filippo Rivetti, who happened to be at the right place at the right time, said he felt anxious while photographing the daredevils.

'They asked me if I wanted to jump with them but I said maybe next time because I'm not an expert climber,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was actually at Hanging Rock for another job and it was just a coincidence that I saw the guys.' 

Mr Lennert has been travelling for 8 months and says Australia is 'an awesome country for rock climbing'.

He had been staying in the Blue Mountains for about a month before he was told about Hanging Rock nearby.

'I didn't know about this place but someone told me it was popular so I thought I better check it out,' he said.

He acknowledged that it was probably one of the highest cliff he's ever jumped off.

A documentary, titled The Edge, was also filmed at the overhanging golden block of sandstone.
