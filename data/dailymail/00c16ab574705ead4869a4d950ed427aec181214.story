A gang of Eastern Europeans were yesterday found guilty of subjecting girls as young as 12 to horrific sexual abuse.

Two adults and three boys were convicted of rape and sexual assault in what prosecutors described as one of the worst cases they had ever seen.

A court heard how the group, of Czech, Slovak and Kurdish origin, groomed five vulnerable girls between 12 and 14 and then abused them in a range of locations, including near a playground, in 2012.

Zdeno Mirga and Hassan Abdulla, who were both convicted of rape

Eighteen-year-old Zdeno Mirga, described by one girl as the ‘boss’, was convicted of eight counts of rape and one count of inciting child prostitution following a trial at the Old Bailey. One of his victims told how Mirga would take her to parties and ‘share’ her for money to buy vodka and cannabis.

Angela Rafferty, prosecuting, told the court: ‘He encouraged her, often very forcefully indeed, to give others sex. He did this using the power he had over her at the time, or threatened her, and sometimes he used violence against her.’

A child sex gang has been found guilty at the Old Bailey of a series of rapes against five vulnerable girls

Hassan Abdulla, 33, was convicted of four rapes and three counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Two boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of various counts of rape and sexual assault. A third was found guilty of sexual activity with a child, but cleared of rape.

The Crown Prosecution Service said the case was one of the worst examples of child sex abuse it had ever seen. The court had earlier heard how a 13-year-old victim was forced to perform sex acts on up to ten attackers in a park as one urged: ‘Rape her.’

A team of interpreters were brought in to work on the case, which lasted two and a half months. Judge John Bevan QC said: ‘Because some of the defendants do not speak good enough English, despite having lived here a long time, three interpreters have worked full time during this case, at a cost of over £30,000.’

The judge will sentence the gang, from Peterborough, on February 20.

Speaking after yesterday’s verdicts, detective superintendent Gary Ridgway of Cambridgeshire Police said: ‘These girls were targeted simply because they were vulnerable. They were seen as easy targets and exploited by this group of teenage boys and men who abused them for their own sexual gratification.

‘The victims, who were as young as 12, were subjected to horrific ordeals. But they have shown incredible strength throughout this process – in particular by giving evidence at court in order to bring these people to justice. We are committed to helping those girls pick up the pieces and move on with their lives.’

The Home Affairs Select committee has called on the Government to introduce special courts to ensure child sex attackers are brought to justice. It discovered that some victims found the trial of their abusers more harrowing than their crimes, following marathon cross-examinations by teams of aggressive defence barristers.

Investigation: Peterborough City Council said it had called for a serious case review

The latest case comes after seven Oxford men, mostly of Pakistani heritage, were convicted at the Old Bailey last year of running a paedophile sex ring. That trial had followed another, almost exactly 12 months earlier, concerning nine Asian men based in Rochdale.

Peterborough has seen a sizeable influx of immigrants in the past ten years, leading to racial tensions in the city. The 2011 census revealed that only 70.9 per cent of the population was white British, compared with 85.7 per cent ten years earlier.

In 2001, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, 17-year-old Ross Parker was murdered by a group of Muslim youths in the city, in what the judge described at the trial as a ‘racist killing’.

Extra police officers were called in to patrol the city centre in May 2004 following four nights of violent clashes between Pakistani, Afghan and Iraqi men which left homes damaged and cars on fire.

Two months later, a festival organised by the city’s Indian community to celebrate diversity ended in more violence as Pakistani and Iraqi groups clashed.
