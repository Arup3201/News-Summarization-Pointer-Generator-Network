Quiet day at the office: Radio 1 Djs including Fearne Cotton, pictured, today, were banned from speaking

Listeners of Radio 1 witnessed something of a first today when they tuned into the BBC's popular music station to hear... music. And only music.

Presenters Nick Grimshaw, Fearne Cotton, Scott Mills and Greg James are being forced to keep schtum for 12 hours - with Twitter as the only outlet for their usual chatter.

Continuous music has played from 7am until 7pm - and judging by the reactions on Twitter, listeners were pleased to have some respite from the vocal inputs of the station's DJs.

The station, which is keen to attract
a somewhat younger audience than the 30-year-old crowd who used to tune
into Chris Moyles, announced the stunt as the end to their Even More 
Music Month of September - which saw 'some of the biggest names in 
music' perform in the station's live lounge including Justin Timberlake 
and Laura Mvula.

The only verbal interruptions came in the form of from news updates from the Radio 1 Newsbeat team, Chris Smith and Tulip Mazunda.

Those who were desperate to get some 
of the usual banter during today's spell of quiet were invited to turn 
to the station's official Twitter feed, @BBCR1, where the four DJs were 
granted a chance to let off steam.

From
the start, listeners expressed their relief at the calm, with Jack Goff
tweeting at the time of Nick Grimshaw's usual breakfast show: 'Been 
listening for almost 2 hours now and not heard Nick Grimshaw's voice 
once. #perfect'.

Several Twitter users said that it was good to hear the station doing what it was designed for.

Noises off: At 7am, Radio 1 announces that silence will reign... and Twitter will become the platform for the presenters' prattle

Relief: Nick Grimshaw's breakfast show was the first moment listeners heard - and relished - the sound of music uninterrupted

Sound of silence: Listeners said that it was a change to hear a music station playing actual music

Miffed: Some Twitter users confessed that they missed the casual banter of the Radio 1 presenters as music rang out over the airwaves

Bemused: The stunt passed some listeners by for several hours before they realised the presenters were nowhere to be heard

Michael Ridout tweeted: 'It's so good listening to the radio when there's no talking. Well played'.

There
were, however, one or two who apparently missed the friendly chit-chat 
of Fearne et al.

Twitter user 
Harry Foster wrote: 'Don't like
that #Radio1 aren't letting the DJs talk today. That's what I listen 
for'.

And Neil Phillips was
one who confessed that he hadn't even noticed the difference, tweeting -
at around 3.30pm - 'Listening to #radio1 since 7.50am, only just 
noticed no one is talking. In a world of my own'.

Meanwhile, the presenters themselves appeared to have adopted coping strategies to deal with this day-long challenge.

Phew! Challenge complete, Fearne Cotton, left, leaves the BBC Radio 1 studio after the challenge, which kicked off with Nick Grimshaw, pictured right, this morning

Fidgety Fearne: The presenter finds it tough to get used to the alternative to usual listener phone-ins

A picture is worth... Fearne Cotton creates doodles to describe the songs that are coming up. Any guesses?

Fearne Cotton seemed to get a bit 
angsty without any verbal feedback, and began demanding more interaction
from Radio 1 listeners.

In the end she took to inflicting 'doodles' on the Twitter feed to help listeners 'guess' which songs were coming up.

Scott Mills apparently found the challenge almost impossible, tweeting after less than an hour: 'I WANNA TALK!!!!'

And the DJs eventually made do with 'writing along' to the lyrics of songs such as Mariah Carey's We Belong Together.

Chatterboxes: Greg James, left, and Scott Mills, right, were forced to keep silent throughout their shows

Too tough: Scott Mills almost caves in on his airwaves silence, relying on Twitter to release the tension

Write-along: The presenters do their best to join in, but it just isn't quite the same on Twitter...

Of course, there was still time for those endearing antics for which the Radio 1 team are so beloved.

Scott Mills's sidekick Chris at one stage took over the Twitter feed while Mills had gone for a break and changed his profile picture.

Greg James - who took over from 4pm - joked that he had spent the previous day scheduling tweets so he could bunk off in Brighton.Â 

By 7pm, all will be back to normal, and the presenters will return to their usual slots on Monday morning.
