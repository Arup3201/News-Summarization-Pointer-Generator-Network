Supporter: Alan Duncan MP said the couple should have a right to defend their property

Two alleged burglars shot during a break-in have both now been discharged from hospital and put in police custody, officers revealed today.

And homeowners Andy Ferrie, 35, and his wife Tracey, 43,  who were arrested on suspicion of grievous 
bodily harm, are still being held, it also emerged.

Police were given extra time to question the couple who were arrested after dialling 999 in the early hours of Sunday when their 
home near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, was broken into by four men.

Businessman Mr Ferrie, who runs a 
mobile home and caravan repair business, has told police he fired a 
legally-owned shotgun at the alleged intruders, injuring two.

At around the same time, one of the injured men called an ambulance, and the second man later admitted himself to hospital.

Now police say the 27-year-old man was discharged from hospital this afternoon and are now in police custody.

A spokesman said: 'The two men who did attend hospital, aged 33 and 27 years old, are now in police custody for questioning.'

As the couple remained in custody, their local MP, Tory Alan Duncan, spoke out in support of them, declaring they were the ‘victims’ and should be free to defend their property.

International development minister Mr Duncan argued: ‘If this is a straightforward case of someone using a shotgun to defend themselves against burglars in the dead of night, then I would hope that the police will prosecute the burglars and not my constituents.

‘The householder is the victim here  and justice should support them and prosecute the burglars.’

The two men and two alleged accomplices were all arrested at the hospital and the pair’s injuries are not life-threatening.

Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie

Last night, Mr and Mrs Ferrie were still being held by police, more than 36 hours after the terrifying raid.

The case comes as the Government 
prepares to introduce legislation to clarify the law on a homeowner’s 
right to defend their property from intruders. The debate first rose to 
prominence in 1999 when farmer Tony Martin shot dead 16-year-old Fred 
Barras at his Norfolk home.

The farmer received a life sentence 
for murder at Norwich Crown Court in April 2000, but this was reduced by
 the Appeal Court to five years for manslaughter and he was released in 
2003.

Last night the millionaire businessman
 who led the campaign against the conviction of Mr Martin said the 
arrest of the Ferries showed the rights of homeowners were still 
unclear.

Malcolm Starr added: ‘I do not think 
people should suffer the trauma of being arrested and held in a police 
station when they are visited by uninvited people in the middle of the 
night. The benefit of the doubt should lie with them.’

Magistrates yesterday granted 
Leicestershire Police an extra 36 hours to question the Ferries, along 
with the four men aged 27, 23, 31 and 33 who are being held on suspicion
 of aggravated burglary.

Mr Ferrie’s mother, Susan Spilner, 56,
 from Uppingham, Rutland, said the couple had been the victims of 
burglaries three or four times previously.

‘One of them was quite nasty,’ she added. ‘They have not been injured but property has been stolen.’

The couple first rented the cottage in Welby between 2001 and 2006 before buying their own home in Melton Mowbray.

But they moved back to the cottage 
this summer while they arranged a move to Australia, which is planned 
for next year. They decided to emigrate to a warmer climate because Mr 
Ferrie suffers from stiff joints. The hamlet where the cottage is 
located consists of just a church and handful of farm buildings and 
cottages.

Mr Ferrie’s stepfather Maris Spilner, 60, said his step-son was a ‘decent man’.

He said the shooting was ‘out of character’ but added: ‘If someone breaks into your home, it’s a violation of your privacy.’ 

Mr Ferrie’s father Joseph, from 
Syston, Leicester, added: ‘Andy and Tracey are law-abiding people who 
have never been in trouble before.

‘They live in the country – there are 
 rats and all sorts and it is not unusual to own a shotgun. They would 
have been asleep in their beds, perhaps they heard the dogs barking and 
reacted. They must have been frightened. Anybody would be in that 
situation.’

Lyn Codwallader, a former neighbour 
who lived in Welby at the same time as the Ferries during their first 
stay in the hamlet, said the remote spot was an ‘easy target’ for 
burglars.

‘We moved in on the Saturday and were 
burgled by the Monday,’ she added. ‘They [Mr and Mrs Ferrie] were broken
 into as well that week and that was years ago. It is because it is in 
the middle of nowhere.’

The four suspected burglars, aged 23, 27, 31, and 33, were all arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary

Melton Mowbray was described by residents as a quiet, rural community

Announcing plans to clarify the 
legislation into the issue in June last year, Justice Secretary Kenneth 
Clarke said people were entitled to use ‘whatever force necessary’ to 
protect themselves and their homes from intruders.

His statement came shortly after Peter
 Flanagan, a 59-year-old engineer, was arrested on suspicion of murder 
after stabbing to death an armed burglar in Salford. Mr Flanagan was 
later released without charge after prosecutors said they were satisfied
 he had acted ‘in self-defence’.

The following month, grandfather Cecil
 Coley, 72, was freed without charge after he stabbed an armed raider to
 death when a gang smashed their way into his florist’s shop in Old 
Trafford, Manchester.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman  said 
that legislation in the Legal Aid,  Sentencing and Punishment of 
Offenders Bill, which comes into force later this  year, ‘clarifies that
 if you do react instinctively to repel an intruder you will not be  
punished for it – as long as you use reasonable force’.
