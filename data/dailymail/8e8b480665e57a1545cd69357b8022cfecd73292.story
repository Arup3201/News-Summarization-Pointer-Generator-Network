It's official: we are a nation of Sauvignon Blanc fanatics.

The dry white white has been revealed as the most popular tipple in almost every British town, city and county, a new study has shown. 

It also revealed that Glasgow has the greatest penchant for Grenache, Bournemouth likes painting the town red with Merlot and Malbec and Chardonnay comes out tops in Berkshire.

The research was conducted by British wine merchants Laithwaite's Wine, which polled more than 400,000 of its customers.

Analysing more than a hundred grape varieties and wine regions, Laithwaite's Wine found that Sauvignon Blanc came out on top with only Berkshire bucks the trend, drinking more of our second favourite grape, Chardonnay.

Drink up! Britons love their Sauvignon Blanc 

The dominance of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay in the UK paints only half the national picture however as a closer look at the figures reveals that our wine tastes are far more varied and diverse

Studying the wine orders of each town and city in the UK reveals that Glasgow has the greatest penchant for Grenache, with the highest proportion of bottles sold here.

Bournemouth is painting the town red with the highest percentage sales of Merlot and Malbec.

Residents of Hammersmith and Fulham are keeping Beaujolais Nouveau fashionable, Rosé is most at home in Ramsgate and Slough leads the way in enjoying a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon.

When it comes to sparkling, Liverpool came out on top as the city with the highest percentage of Prosecco drinkers. 

Unsurprisingly, Champagne flutes are filling up most frequently in the City of London and Westminster.

Beth Willard, Wine Buyer at Laithwaite's Wine says: 'It's great to be able to draw up the first 'Grape Britain' wine map.

1. Sauvignon Blanc

2. Chardonnay

3. Merlot

4. Cabernet Sauvignon

5. Shiraz

6. Grenache

7. Pinot Noir

8. Tempranillo

9. Pinot Grigio

10. Malbec

'What it shows is that, while Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay have a huge nationwide appeal, we are actually a nation of wine connoisseurs, with our own unique tastes and preferences, and a willingness to be adventurous in our selection.

'We've seen a slight shift in the nation's palate over the last few years to wines made from lesser known varieties and from less mainstream regions. 

'Wines from Romania and Hungary are becoming more popular than traditional favourites like Italian Pinot Grigio. Sauvignon Blanc's dominance at the top of that list might soon be challenged.'
