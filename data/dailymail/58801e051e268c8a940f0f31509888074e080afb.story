A ram raider's attempt at a quick getaway was thwarted by police when he tried to flee the scene of the crime in a lorry cab with a top speed of less than 60mph.

The hapless thief had reversed the truck into the front of a luxury jewellers store in Southampton, Hampshire, jumped out of the cab and stolen a haul of expensive Rolex watches.

But his plan began to unravel when the lorry got stuck in the shopfront stopping him from driving away.

Drama: Onlookers gather around the scene after a ram raider smashed a truck into the front of a jewellers shop in Southampton, Hampshire, and tried to steal Rolex watches

Thwarted: The bungling ram raider's truck got caught in the front of the jewellers shop and he couldn't drive the vehicle away

Damage: A police officer inspects the front of the jewellers shop which was reversed into by the lorry

The would-be raider managed to unhitch the cab from the trailer and waved at witnesses who were filming the incident on their mobile phones.

Police gave chase moments after the incident and tried to pull the cab over moments after he drove away from the store, leaving the trailer blocking the road.

But with a top speed of just 56mph, the crook made it less than two miles from the crime scene before he was stopped and arrested by officers who recovered the watches.

Leeanne Bowers, 25, a supervisor at a model shop opposite the jewellers, described the raid as 'comical'.

Hapless: The ram raider unhooked the cab of the truck and drove away from the scene leaving the trailer blocking the road

She said: 'I was talking to a customer at the front of my shop when I saw a lorry outside which seemed to be attempting a three-point turn.

'It started reversing towards the jewellers but didn't stop and smashed into the glass at the front. I couldn't believe it.

'The driver got out of the cab, walked over to the display and started to fill his pockets with jewellery. He looked so smug.

'He then walked casually back to the cab, threw his haul inside, and tried to drive away but realised he was stuck. It was so comical.

'By this time a lot of people had started to film the incident on their mobile phones, but he didn't seem to care - he even looked over and waved.

'He got back out, unhooked the cab and eventually raced away, dodging buses and other traffic.'

She added: 'When he first smashed into the window and got out, I thought he was going over to apologise. I couldn't believe it was a raid.

'He made no attempt to cover himself up and looked so normal.'

Charmaine Smith, 23, who was also working in a nearby shop, said: 'He was reversing and went through the window.

'He moved forward and out of the cab and walked around. He took his clips off the back of the lorry and unclipped it from the cab.

'He got back in and sped up the road and through the traffic lights.'

Slow getaway: The raider made it less than two miles from the shop before he was caught by police as his getaway vehicle had a top speed of just 56mph

Arrest: Police recovered the watches that were stolen and arrested a 54-year-old man from Portsmouth

Susan Rolling, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: 'An articulated lorry had been reversed down the road and into the jewellers window, where the driver helped himself to watches.

'The thief fled from the scene in the white Mercedes cab of the lorry, leaving the trailer behind in the jewellers window and blocking the busy road.

'A few minutes later, police spotted the Mercedes cab.

'When officers attempted to pull it over, the driver reversed the cab into the police car.

'No one was injured, and police arrested a 54-year-old Portsmouth man.'
