If the secret to a happy marriage is doing whatever your wife wants, this pair are on course for a lifetime together.

The couple celebrated their engagement by recreating famous moments from the bride-to-be's favourite chick-flick.

Cindy Gauthier, 31, and Jean-Nicola Barile, posed up for a shoot inspired by 2004 romance The Notebook. The film is a favourite of Ms Gauthier, who says that she's often told she looks like female lead Rachel McAdams.

'At first I wasn't comfortable with having regular engagement photographs, so our photographer introduced the idea of a theme,' she said.

'We talked about the shoot for a while and decided on The Notebook - it's a film that we both love.

'I borrowed my sister's dress for the photo shoot and my friend styled my hair. It all came together really nicely.'

The photoshoot took place in Chertsey, Quebec, Canada, and took five hours. The Notebook is a romantic drama film set in the 1940s about a couple who fall in love on Seabrook Island, North Carolina.

'The weather was really lovely for the shoot. It started to get a bit overcast, but that was perfect timing for the kissing in the rain scene,' said Ms Gauthier.

'One of my favourite parts of the day was being pictured in the canoe. It was so much fun'

Chelsea Gray, owner of the Blushing Bride Studio in Quebec, took the photos.

'All
 of our couples get the engagement shoot included in the wedding 
package,' she said. 'It's really great to get to know them before the 
big day too.

'I hadn't seen The Notebook until the night before the shoot. I sobbed the whole way through.

'The
 red vintage truck was a completely lucky find. We were driving around 
the country looking for inspiration when we came across the perfect 
truck at the side of the road, we got so excited.' 

'Lucky find': The couple and their photographer spotted this vintage red truck, like one from the movie, as they were driving around their location looking for good spots to take the photographs

Ms Gauthier and Mr Barile had their Notebook photos taken in July 2010 and the couple, who are from Quebec, tied the knot in September that year.
