Shaquan Duley, 30, has been jailed for 35 years for the murder of her two toddlers

An unemployed and mentally ill South Carolina mother has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for killing her two young sons, then putting them in her car and staging a crash into a river.

Shaquan Duley, 30, said nothing during the hearing except a very quiet 'yes sir' as Circuit Court Judge Edgar Dickson asked her questions.

Dickson said he appreciated Duley taking responsibility but she needed to be punished for what she did.

'The sentence I hand down today does not reflect in any way this court minimizing the horror of what you did to your children, your family and this community,' Dickson said.

Duley faced 30 years to life in prison after pleading guilty earlier this month to two counts of murder in the deaths of her sons, 2-year-old Devean and 18-month-old Ja'van in August 2010.

The mother made no deal with prosecutors.

After pleading guilty, Duley tearfully apologized for what she did. She also said she was happy that God let her keep her memories of her sons.

'In spite of whatever I've gone through,' Duley said. 'I still have hope and joy in my heart that one day I will see them again.'

The case brought back heartrending reminders of Susan Smith, who rolled her car into a lake in Union County with her 3-year-old and 14-month-old sons in the back seat in Union in 1994.

But the cases differed in big ways. 
Prosecutors said Smith's sons were alive when her car went into the 
lake, and she killed her boys because a man with whom she had an affair 
broke off their relationship.

Prosecutors
said Duley suffocated her sons with her hands in a motel room before 
strapping them into their car seats and driving to the river 10 miles 
away.

She killed them because she was depressed over failing online classes and not having a job.

She
also was upset the father of the boys didn't have anything to do with 
them and just had a fight where her mother said she was a bad parent, 
investigators said.

Duley first told police she fell asleep before running off a bridge over the North Edisto River.

But
there were no skid marks or damage to the bridge. Instead, 
investigators think she drove to a boat ramp and got out of her car 
before letting it roll into the river.

Duley's attorney said she intended to stay in the car and kill herself.

She
also tried to commit suicide a couple of other times by taking an 
overdose of headache medicine and trying to cut her wrist with a box 
cutter after killing her sons.

Police at the time said she confessed after initially lying about the deaths and trying to make them look accidental.

'She
was a mother that was unemployed. She had no means of taking care of 
her children,' then-Sheriff Larry Williams said in 2010.

A state-appointed forensic 
psychiatrist found last summer that Duley suffered from mental illness 
but that she knew right from wrong and knew what she was doing when she 
killed her children, Pascoe said.

The father of Duley's children was never located, the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office said.
