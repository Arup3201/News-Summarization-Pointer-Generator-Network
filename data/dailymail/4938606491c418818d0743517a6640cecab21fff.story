Murder investigation: A 13-year-old girl has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was found dead down a remote country lane near Everton, pictured, in North Nottinghamshire

A police spokesman said: 'All five people have been arrested on suspicion of murder and all are from the South Yorkshire area.

'Officers from South Yorkshire Police have also been assisting the investigation.'

Tonight police cars stood guard at both ends of the muddy lane - called Middle Cross Lane - where the body was found.

A white tent had been erected by forensics teams investigating the death. The results of a post-mortem examination have so far proven inconclusive.

Residents who live nearby were not answering their doors tonight.

However one resident, who did not want to be named, said there had been rumours the man had been a drug dealer from Doncaster whose body had been dumped in the lane.

Speaking at the Sun Inn pub in Everton, the resident, said: I know very little apart from what we've got from the police.

'There has been talk in the village that it's a drug dealer from Doncaster who was found dumped but that's all I've heard.

'Sniffer dogs have been up at the scene and I think the body was taken away yesterday by the police.

'I doubt it's anyone from the village. I can't imagine anyone here doing anything like that. Its a nice area around here.'

Detective Chief Inspector Phil Cox, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Although we have made five arrests detectives are continuing to make enquiries in the area.

'We are keen to speak to anyone who might have seen something unusual in the area, particularly between Friday 1 February and the afternoon of Saturday 2 February.'
