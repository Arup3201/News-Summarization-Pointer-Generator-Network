Poor taste: The cafe named a sandwich after prosecutor Giovanni Falcone, who was murdered by the Mafia in 1992 for his efforts to defeat them

An Austrian cafe named sandwiches after victims of the Mafia - and sparked an international row.

Italy's foreign ministry complained to Austrian authorities on Saturday about the Vienna pub's bad taste products.

Customers of Don Panino can order a Giovianni Falcone, named after the prosecutor killed by a Mafia bombing in 1992.

The sandwich is 'the greatest nemesis of the Mafia in Palermo but unfortunately grilled like a sausage'.

A Peppino Impastato offering on the menu is 'a big-mouthed Sicilian, cooked by a bomb like a chicken in a barbecue'.

It is named for the anti-Mafia activist who rebelled against his mobster father, used his local radio prgoram to ridicule Cosa Nostra, as the Sicilian Mafia is known, and was found blown up on a railroad track in 1978.

The foreign ministry said that Italy's 
charge d'affaires in Vienna 'intervened to sensitize' local authorities, after Don Panino's menu upset Italians in Vienna and public opinion in 
Italy.

Joking about those who have died fighting the Mafia is 'offensive' and 'unacceptable', the ministry said.

Other dishes on the menu are named after top Italian mobsters as well as Tommaso Buscetta, the mobster turned supergrass whose testimony helped convict hundreds of Mafiosa in Italy.

The Italian owners, Marco and Julia Marchetta, opened the cafe in 2009 to sell sandwiches 'full of the delights typical of our own country', reports the Independent.

The Don Panino is believed to have closed its doors following the criticism and has taken down its website.

Italian state TV said the pub was run by Italians, and that Italians living in Vienna were behind the drive to close it.
