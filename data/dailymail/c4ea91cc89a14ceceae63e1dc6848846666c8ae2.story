A 'degrading and dangerous' Facebook page which invites followers to name and shame women and their sexual behaviour has caused an uproar after gaining more than 10,000 likes in just a few weeks.

The page, called 'Prague Sluts' because it refers to women in the capital of the Czech Republic of Prague, was set up three weeks ago and asks followers to send in pictures of 'easy girls' and to write short descriptions about them.

Now it has been flooded with thousands of 'likes' and hundreds of photos showing scantily-clad local women.

Pictures that were uploaded to the Facebook page show two women posing for selfies

Photos posted on the page are often accompanied by comments speculating on the women's sexual exploits

The identities of the women pictured on the Facebook page are not concealed like they are in these images

Typical comments include things such as: 'She lost her virginity when she was 13 and has slept with half of Prague. She's a real slut.'

Although it doesn't give the women's real names, there is no attempt to hide their faces so identifying who they are is easy to those who know them.

Critics have now slammed the page saying it is damaging to the women's reputations and to their safety.

Facebook commentator Nikola Dvorakova wrote on the page: 'Can you prove that the things about the girls posted on this page are true?

'I don't think you realise what harm this can brings to those accused.'

And women's rights campaigner Jitka Bezdekova also waded into the debate, calling the site 'abhorrent'.

This photo of two girls standing together was also posted on the relatively new Facebook page

A photo grab of the page shows it has attracted nearly 10,000 followers since it first began operating

The Facebook page, which has been labelled 'degrading and dangerous', has gathered thousands of followers

She said: 'This is an abhorrent site and is completely degrading and dangerous for the young girls who find themselves being put on the page.

'They have not given their permission for their photos to be used in this way and despite asking for them to be taken down they are ignored by the people behind the page.'

A local police spokesman said: 'We are looking into the matter and if there is a clear case of defamation or breach of privacy we will take action.'
