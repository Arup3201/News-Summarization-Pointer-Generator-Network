The mother of Baby P will be given detailed advice on how to hide her identity when she leaves jail in the coming days to avoid being tracked down and attacked by vigilantes.

Tracey Connelly, who allowed her son Peter to be tortured to death by her boyfriend, will be told to change her name and appearance after she was refused a new identity funded by the taxpayer.

The 32-year-old is expected to be freed by a parole board this week and will leave Low Newton jail near Durham for a
parole hostel 'within days' where she will start her reintegration back into society.

Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is set to walk free from prison this
week without a new identity and will be advised how to hide. She was jailed in 2009 
over the death of her son Baby P, Peter Connelly, right

She is already said to look markedly different from her notorious mugshot, having ballooned to 22st while in prison.

But probation officers will also advise her to change her name by deed poll, change to colour of her hair and have it cut differently.

After just five years in jail experts believe she poses ‘no danger to the public’, despite committing a crime that horrified Britain.

'She will be subject to intense supervision and monitoring once she is freed and that will go on for years to come,' criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher told the Mirror.

There is a danger that she is at risk from vigilantes, so steps will be taken to prevent that. She will receive advice and coaching on not giving away her identity, and that could take several weeks.

‘Steps will be taken to keep her safe including moving her to a new area, a change of appearance and name.’

Set to leave: Connelly - who is at Low Newton jail (pictured) in Brasside, County Durham - has applied to the Parole Board to have her case reviewed, who are expected to let her go after five years in prison

Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing 
nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend 
Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

Peter was just 
17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his 
mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate 
injuries, including a broken back.

The case provoked a national 
scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a
series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life.

Sickened
by the depravity, 132,000 people joined ‘hate groups’ on social 
networking internet sites calling for Connelly, Barker and Owen to ‘burn
in hell’.

Some threatened to violently attack them when they are eventually released.

Despite widespread horror at her imminent release, ministers have 
decided she should not be granted lifetime anonymity and round-the-clock
police protection.

Indefinite sentences: Tracey Connelly's 
boyfriend Steven Barker (left) and his paedophile brother Jason Owen 
(right) were both convicted of causing or allowing Peter's death

Anonymity orders are rare and only four are currently in force.

These
apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert 
Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi
for Soham murderer Ian Huntley.

So instead she will have to use her own initiative to avoid detection, and  has already told friends she wants a new boyfriend when she is released.

But even her own mother believes she should never leave prison.

Mary O’Connor said: 'She should never come out. But even if she does, I won’t be seeing her again – she’s out of my life.

'She wants me to move to Kent with her, but I said no.'
