The Oxford Union was in fresh turmoil last night after its treasurer resigned over the society’s handling of a sex scandal which has seen its president arrested on suspicion of rape.

Charles Malton, 20, a history student at Christ Church, Oxford, left four days after the prestigious debating society’s leader Ben Sullivan, 21, was taken in by police.

Mr Malton’s resignation letter to acting president Mayank Banerjee, of St John's College, said: ‘People are innocent until proven guilty and I have every hope that Ben will prove to be innocent. However, the way in which many within the Union have handled this situation over the last few weeks is not behaviour that I would wish to associate myself with.’

Prior to the arrest, Mr Malton voted for the Union to pay £1,200 in legal fees for Sullivan to take action against a student news website.

The Tab Oxford had alleged Sullivan was a member of a drinking club called The Banter Squadron, which he later admitted was true.

Mr Malton said his position had become ‘untenable’ following Sullivan’s arrest on suspicion of rape and attempted rape of two female students last year.

The debating society has been a breeding ground for notable figures since it was founded in 1823, with William Gladstone, Herbert Asquith , Edward Heath, Tony Benn, Benazir Bhutto, Michael Foot, Sir Robin Day, Gyles Brandreth, Jeremy Thorpe, Lord Heseltine, John Buchan, Foreign Secretary William Hague, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, among its former presidents.

But its leadership has been in crisis ever since allegations began swirling about Sullivan, a banker’s son from Kensington, west London, who studies history and politics.

He was held by Thames Valley Police for several hours on Wednesday before being released on bail.

The Oxford Union did not respond to requests for comment.
