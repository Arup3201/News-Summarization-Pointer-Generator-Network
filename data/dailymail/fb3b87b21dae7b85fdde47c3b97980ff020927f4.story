An eight-year-old girl will complete 600 acts of kindness in memory of her late grandmother this month.

Alex McKelvey of Washington state thought of the idea in 2013 after losing her grandmother, Linda, and set out to complete 60 random acts of kindness by March 22, 2014 - which would have been her grandmother's 60th birthday.

But because she enjoyed giving to others so much, the first-grader, who has completed 487 acts to date, will have completed 600 acts of kindness by March 22, 2015.

The first-grader, who has completed 487 acts to date, will have performed 600 acts of kindness by March 22, 2015 (above Alex and her mother Sarah pictured while volunteering at the Rescue Mission that provides food and shelter for those in need, her 472nd act of kindness)

Alex, and her mother Sarah, had decided to do the first set of 60 acts of kindness in September 2013 after Linda passed away instead of mourning, according Q13Fox.

'We bought coffee, ice cream, donated various things, went to IHOP and left a very cool tip for one of our waitresses, and we ended the day by going on a toy shopping spree for St. Jude's' Children's Hospital,' said Sarah, a caseworker for Greater Lakes Mental Health.

She added: 'Alex had so much fun that day, you could see the joy on her face and so we said why not add an extra zero and go for 600?'

Alex said that she chose 600 because it was 10 times more than 60, but she dreams of reaching many more people, according to the News Tribune. 

The young girl said: 'We're going to do thousands, then a million. I'd like to reach so many people.'

So far, Alex and her mother have volunteered at food kitchens, given gifts to teachers and staff at school, handed out care packages and candy treats, to given out laundry pots filled with quarters and detergent to people at a laundromat.

All of the acts of kindness to date have been documented on an Instagram account Alex's mother started (above Alex and Sarah after going on a shopping spree for toys to donate to St. Jude's in the 60th act of kindness on March 22, 2014)

'We're not rich or close to it. But we decided to use our finances a little differently,' said Sarah. 'We're giving up a few luxury things, and we've chosen to live a simple life.'

Alex's dad, Army Sgt. Richard McKelvey, has also participated but he said it is mostly the two women in his life who are spreading the good deeds.

Together the family most recently repainted the Youth Center at the Lakewood YMCA, and also were able to give the center new board games and a piece of art thanks to their own financial contributions, online donations and contributions from stores.

All of the acts of kindness to date have been documented on an Instagram account Alex's mother started with the hashtag 'FORLINDA'.

Sarah said that she amazed by Alex's heart and her spirit of giving (above Alex and Sarah pictured on Mother's Day last year)

Sarah recently wrote a post ahead of Sunday when Alex will have completed 600 acts of kindness.

She wrote: 'Last year it all started by doing 60 acts of loving kindness that we bunched together like coffees and ice creams. 

'This birthday we wanted to reach further by doing 61 different acts that day and figured we had better make a list to keep the day organized.

'We are so happy to see so many new followers and Alex loves when I read her all the fabulous and kind comments you have left. It truly makes all our hearts swell with love. 

'Thank you to you all for choosing to follow Alex on this journey of loving kindness in memory of her Nana. Much love and stay tuned.'

Sarah said that she amazed by Alex's heart and her spirit of giving.

She said: 'I think "if an 8-year-old can do this, why can't anyone?"'
