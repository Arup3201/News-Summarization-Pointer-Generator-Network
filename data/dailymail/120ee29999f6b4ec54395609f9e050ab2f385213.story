An Iowa lottery worker who illegally played the lottery won a multimillion-dollar jackpot in 2010 then asked others to help him claim it, authorities have said. 

Eddie Raymond Tipton, 51, of Norwalk, Iowa, has been charged with two felony counts of fraud.

Authorities had been trying to identify the winner of the $14.3 million Hot Lotto ticket since a New York lawyer tried to claim the prize shortly before the one-year deadline in 2011. 

Tipton, who is the director of information security for the Multi-State Lottery Association, is being held at the Polk County Jail on a $10,000 cash-only bond.

The association oversees several popular lottery games, including Hot Lotto and Powerball and employees are banned from buying tickets or winning prizes.

When attorney Crawford Shaw tried to claim the jackpot with the winning ticket in his hands, lottery officials confirmed the ticket was valid. But they refused to pay because Shaw wouldn't name anyone involved with the purchase and handling of the ticket. 

He later withdrew the claim and said he didn't know the winner's identity. Authorities have not said whether Shaw or anyone else would face charges in the case.

Authorities released a convenience store video in October which purported to show the mystery winner, in an attempt to help identify him. 

At the time it wasn't known if the winner was involved in possible fraud or was was the victim of a crime.

A former co-worker of Tipton's subsequently contacted authorities and tipped them off.

Detectives then  analysed the ticket purchaser's voice in the video and matched a license plate in the parking lot of the convenience store to Tipton.

Authorities say Tipton contacted two men in Texas asking for help to claim the jackpot anonymously. One man attended school with Tipton; it's unclear how Tipton knows the other man.

The men then contacted Shaw and a Canadian man for further help, according to an arrest affidavit. 

Shaw and the Canadian man listed themselves on a newly created trust to collect the lottery prize. 

Tipton won $14.3 million playing hot lotto and was dobbed in by a colleague who recognised him on a tape authorities released in the hope of identifying the person who had purchased the winning ticket

While trying to claim the ticket Shaw told lottery officials the trust's proceeds would go to a corporation in Belize, a country known as a tax haven.

Shaw soon withdrew his claim and said he didn't know the winner's name. In October, officials had said Shaw was cooperating in their investigation.

Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich yesterday said the case was one of the strangest in the history of the lottery.

'We believe this is the largest lottery jackpot ever to be claimed, only to have that claim withdrawn.'

The prize money was eventually returned to the states participating in Hot Lotto. The Iowa Lottery gave away its share during a 2012 promotion.
