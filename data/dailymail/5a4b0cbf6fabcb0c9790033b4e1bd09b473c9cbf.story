'Terrorists have previously attacked or planned to attack such places, including nightclubs, bars, restaurants, international hotels, airports and places of worship in Bali, Jakarta and elsewhere in Indonesia,' DFAT said.

'These types of venues could be attacked again.' 

The terrorist bombings on a Bali nightclub in 2002 killed 202 people, including 88 Australians. 

'You should take particular care to avoid places known to be terrorist targets,' DFAT said.

DFAT say terrorists have previously attacked nightclubs in Indonesia, like the Bali bombings in 2002 (pictured), and has warned these venues could be targeted again

'Tourist areas and attractions throughout Indonesia and tourists travelling to or from these places, including those in tour groups or tour buses, could be targeted.' 

It comes as the US government warned of a potential threat against US-associated hotels and bank in Surabaya, north west of Bali.

'Terrorist groups remain active throughout Indonesia despite police disruptions,' DFAT said.

'Police continue to conduct operations against these groups and have stated publicly that terrorist suspects remaining at large may seek to attack western targets.

'In planning your activities, consider the kind of places known to be terrorist targets and the level of security provided at venues.'
