Billionaire Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay had almost $30,000 in cash when he was arrested earlier this month for driving under the influence.

Irsay, 54, was preliminarily charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and four felony counts of possession of illegal prescription drugs following a March 16 traffic stop in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel - and he had $29,000 in cash, said police.

The cash was stashed inside a metal briefcase, two laundry bags and his wallet, along with a shocking amount of prescription medicines, authorities said.

The arrest report showed a dozen items listed as prescription drugs, but did not offer any further information, according to the Indianapolis Star.

The arresting officer forced Irsay to 
sit on the hood of his car while the Toyota Highlander was being 
searched because he was unable to stand up, according to the report.

Irsay took a breathalizer, but the results were redacted, and the cop 'believed Irsay to be intoxicated on a substance other than alcohol,' the Star reported.

In
 an inventory of Irsay's vehicle, 'multiple prescription drugs were 
discovered in pill bottles,' police said. 'These Schedule IV 
prescription drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles 
found in the vehicle.'

Irsay's attorney, James Voyles, and spokeswoman, Myra Borshoff Cook, didn't immediately return messages seeking comment.

The
 billionaire has been in and out of rehab over the years and has said he
 kicked his addiction to prescription painkillers - but sources close to
 the businessman say otherwise.

Friends say Irsay has been battling his drug problem for some time, and that his arrest could be a blessing in disguise.

'He's a sick, sick man,' one source told the Indy Star. 'He desperately needs help.'

According to the Star, Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances.

The
 night of his arrest, Irsay drove at a slow rate of speed, stopped in 
the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, 
Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release.

'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said.

Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't drink...haven't in over 15 years.'

Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment.

Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay.

A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs.

League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would.

'The league's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel,' Aiello said.

Irsay, who lives in Carmel, became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Along the way, Jim Irsay held virtually every job from ball boy to general manager. Forbes magazine estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion.

Meg Irsay filed in November for divorce from her husband of 33 years, citing an 'irretrievable breakdown' of the marriage.

A joint statement issued by the couple said Jim Irsay would retain full ownership of the Colts and his other business interests.Â  The couple, who married in 1980, have been separated for a decade and are the parents of three adult daughters.

Since taking ownership of the team, Jim Irsay has made a reputation for himself by buying the scroll manuscript of Jack Kerouac's beat poem 'On the Road. 'for $2.43 million and often takes to Twitter to post comments ranging from the Colts' inner workings, popular music, and idle thoughts.
