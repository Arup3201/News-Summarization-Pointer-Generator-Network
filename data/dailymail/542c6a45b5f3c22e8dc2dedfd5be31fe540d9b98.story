Ricky Burns hopes his move up to the light-welterweight division can breathe fresh life into his career after back-to-back defeats.

The Scot will make his debut at the 10st weight limit on Saturday night at the Leeds Arena against Alexandre Lepelley, who is a late replacement for Esteban Gonzalez.

It has been a tough few months for the durable 31-year-old, who first broke his jaw in a hard-fought draw against Raymundo Beltran in a bout many thought the Mexican won.

He then lost his WBO lightweight crown to Terence Crawford and any hopes of another world title tilt were dealt a blow when he was outpointed by unbeaten Montenegrin Dejan Zlaticanin.

While there were calls for him to end his career, Burns said he felt drained attempting to boil down to 135lbs and that moving up to the next weight division could be a huge boost.

'The Zlaticanin fight was a more crushing defeat than actually losing my world title,' said Burns, who has also won a world title in the super-featherweight division.

'I should have been punching holes in him. When I look back at it, I was really, really struggling to get the weight off, it just wasn't budging and it did affect my performance.

'During the fight I knew what was happening, but I couldn't get out of the way of his shots. He was looking for the big overhand left hooks and every time he threw it I knew it was coming, but I couldn't evade them.

'Trying to boil myself down to 9st 9lbs was just draining the energy out of me, so fingers crossed that up here it's a new start.'

This will be Burns' first fight outside Scotland since defeating Michael Katsidis in November 2011 at Wembley Arena, with his last six bouts taking place in Glasgow.

The bill is headlined by Leeds featherweight Josh Warrington, who will be guaranteed a raucous reception as he attempts to claim the vacant European title against Italy's Davide Dieli.

Also featuring is light-middleweight Brian Rose as he attempts to get back to winning ways following his world title defeat to Demetrius Andrade earlier this year. He fights Ignacio Lucero Fraga.
