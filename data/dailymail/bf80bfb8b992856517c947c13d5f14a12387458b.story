Two brothers both lost a leg in the Boston Marathon bombings and were among the 183 injured and up to 10 victims who had a limb torn off.

Liz Norden said one of her sons called her from his ambulance to say, 'Ma, I'm hurt real bad.'

Her sons, both roofers and graduates Stoneham High School, went to the race to watch one of their friends compete in Monday's race.

They were among the 183 injured, 23 of whom are still listed in critical condition Tuesday morning. As many as 10 had limbs amputated.

There were nine children, the youngest of whom is just 2-years-old, among the wounded. An 11-year-old boy had shrapnel tear into his leg and a nine-year-old girl lost a leg.

'He
 was waiting for his mom to go through the finish line to take pictures 
of her and shortly before she got there, the bomb went off,' family 
friend  Janene Sides said.

Shrapnel tore into his leg, seriously wounding the sixth grader whose 12th birthday is in a couple of weeks.

'Dad was up on the bleachers looking down and the crowd got chaotic and he found him lying down,' Sides told ABC News.

Emergency
 responders quickly applied a tourniquet. Aaron's father was separated 
from him and his parents did not immediately know which hospital their 
child had been rushed to.

Aaron is expected to stay in the hospital for one week.

The chief of emergency services at Massachusetts General said he had never seen such horrific injuries in his 25 years of experience. 'This is what we expect from war'

Doctors described treating injuries more commonly seen in the battlefield.

Some patients had up to 40 pieces of shrapnel inside of them.

'I've never obviously been in combat,
 but people I've trained with have been and this is as close as I can 
imagine it would be,' said Dr. Vivek Shah who had just finished 
competing in the race when the two bombs went off.

'Just, basically piles of victims. Everything I saw was a traumatic amputation, basically.'

Shah,
 an orthopedic surgeon at New England Baptist Hospital in Roxbury 
Crossing, Mass., said he saw injuries along the sidewalks on Boylston 
Street.

'In all my medical training, I have not seen things that I saw. Everything was traumatic,' Shah told ABC News.

Dr. George Velmahos, a trauma surgeon, at Massachusetts General Hospital said this afternoon, he saw, 'completely mangled and shredded limbs. We found spiked points in many - - like nails without heads.

'The EMTs deserve praise for getting them here so fast.  Another couple of minutes and some would be dead. The EMTs distributed the patients in a way that no one hospital would be overloaded.'

His colleague, Alasdair Conn, chief of emergency 
services, said, 'This is something I’ve never seen in my 25 years here .
 . . this amount of carnage in the civilian population. This is what we 
expect from war.'

There are 29 patients at Massachusetts General, eight of whom are in critical condition.

Dr. Michael Epstein, who works in the 
emergency department at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said 
at least 24 victims were in their care.

The injuries ranged from eardrum 
damage to those with life-threatening injuries, with some suffering 
'extensive damage', he added.

Brigham and Women's treated 31 patients, many of whom had orthopedic wounds. Five victims are still listed in critical condition as of Tuesday morning.

The youngest patients were taken to Boston Children's Hospital. Seven have been discharged with two remaining in critical condition.

There were also nine patients at Tufts Medical Center.

Destruction: Witnesses are describing how twin bomb blasts turned the 26th mile of the Boston Marathon into a war zone

Witnesses have described how twin bomb 
blasts turned the 26th mile of the Boston Marathon into a war zone, 
littering the final stretch of the race with disembodied limbs, wounded 
runners who lost their legs, and a lone shoe with flesh still in it.

'There were people all over the ground,' said Roupen Bastajian, 35, a state trooper from Smithfield, RI, who had just finished the race.

'We started grabbing tourniquets and started tying legs,' he said, helping victims while still wrapped in his post-race heat blanket.

'In 28 years, this is definitely the worst I've seen,' Boston Fire Department District Chief Ron Harrington told NBC News.

'Bodies and body parts. Blood all 
over. A little boy lying in the street. A young woman in her twenties. 
Both dead. It was mayhem. I saw two people with arms hanging loose, and 
one without a leg.

The homemade explosives were believed to have been made using pressure cookers and metal ball bearings, designed to look like discarded trash and placed inside black dufflebags.

Initial
 tests showed no use of C-4 or other high-grade explosives, suggesting 
that the packages detonated in the attack were crude explosive devices, 
federal law enforcement officials said.

The
 two detonated explosives were packed with metal objects and placed low 
to the ground, which could explain why so many victims lost feet, calves
 and ankles in the horrific explosions.

Massachusetts
 General Hospital trauma surgeon George Velmahos said today that a variety of 
sharp metal fragments were extracted from victims, including pellets and
 nails.

'The experience has been overwhelming; …we’re suffering emotionally for what happened to the people of Boston and many others,' Velmahos said
