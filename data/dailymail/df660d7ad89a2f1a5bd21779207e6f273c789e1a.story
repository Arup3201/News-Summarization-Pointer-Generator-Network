Do you dread winter? Hate stepping outside because no matter how much you wrap up, you end up freezing?

Then a new range of heated clothing could be the answer to all your woes.

TechNiche has launched a selection of clothes that can heat up to a toasty 60°C.

Cosy: A new range of heated clothing - such as the vest, pictured - could be the answer to winter shivers

The IonGear battery-powered vests, jackets and gloves use lithium batteries and carbon filaments to generate heat and are adjustable so a wearer can choose the temperature according to the weather.

Its makers say the clothing is aimed at those who work outdoors, exercise outside, compete as an athlete in extreme weather or just feel the cold very easily.

After stepping back indoors, a user simply recharges the battery and the garment is ready to use again the next day.

Electric: The vest contains three pads (pictured) - one in each front side and one across the lower back - fitted to a 7.4V battery and have a temperature controller with three settings

The vest and jacket contain three pads - one in each front side and one across the lower back - fitted to a 7.4V battery and have a temperature controller with three settings - low (40°C), medium (50°C) and high (60°C).

The clothing starts to warm up within one or two minutes of being switched on and can stay warm for up to nine hours, depending on what temperature you set it to.

The battery fully recharges in around four hours and has around 500 charges in it.

The heating elements, battery and temperature controller can all be removed to wash the clothing.

Hot to trot: Items in the heated range include the gilet vest (pictured left) and sturdy gloves (pictured, right)

Heat: The gloves have elements built into them which run along the back of the hand and each finger

The gloves have heating elements built into them which run along the back of the hand and each finger, and each glove has its own battery and multi-level temperature controller with four settings ranging from 32-57°C.

A spokesman for TechNiche said: 'We have the solutions you need to beat the cold while at work, rest and play. 

'We offer products that allow you to work longer in extreme cold conditions, keeping your mind on the job and helping you perform better.'

The clothing (gloves pictured, right) warms up within one or two minutes and can stay warm for up to nine hours, depending on what temperature you set it to. The battery fully recharges in about four hours

As well as its heated products, TechNiche has grown to become one of the largest manufacturers of cooling vests in the world.

The cooling vests are used by top athletes including Formula 1 teams, ProCycling teams and several national football teams in the Brazil World Cup last year. 

The vest costs £151.10 excluding VAT, £176.10 for the gloves and £194 for the jacket.
