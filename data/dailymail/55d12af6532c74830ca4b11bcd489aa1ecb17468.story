It seems that fox trot and tango aren't the only things the contestants try for the first time on Strictly Come Dancing.

According to the expert tanning team, who work like a well-oiled machine backstage on the BBC show, lots of the stars tried fake tan for the first time too - and some have become hooked on getting a glow. 

The stars of Strictly Come Dancing, who this year include pop stars Pixie Lott and Frankie Bridge, Essex hunk Mark Wright and TV presenter Caroline Flack, get through an astonishing 10 litres of spray tan solution each season.

The celebrities (and professionals) spend their Friday afternoons in the spray tanning booth getting ready for Saturday’s live show.

Each of the stars will then have their skin ‘finished’ by a team of tanning experts who are ready, tanning mitt in hand, to perfect their skin for the cameras. 

The backstage tanning team get through a staggering 108 tubes of St.Tropez Skin Illuminator and over 70 bottles of St.Tropez Tan Enhancing Moisturiser keeping the dancers’ skin hydrated and glowing under the studio lights.

Although some of this year’s contestants, like Frankie Bridge, have been regular tanners for years - Judy Murray, Pixie Lott, Mark Wright and Sunetra Sarker have all lost their tanning virginity in the Strictly tanning booth.

Tanning virgin: According to the St. Tropez's tanning team, who work backstage on Strictly Come Dancing, Mark Wright had never tried fake tan before - but they quickly changed that

You better believe it: Jules said that Mark's jaw hit the floor at the results of his first-ever tan and he couldn't believe how natural it looked

Speaking about working backstage, Jules Heptonstall, official tanner on the show, said: 'Strictly Come Dancing is one of those incredible experiences for the celebrities and one by one, they embark on their Strictlification - and that includes their spray tans.

'Pixie Lott had never had a spray tan before, and now she’s hooked and thoroughly enjoys her regular weekly tan with me.

'Sunetra didn’t realise spray tans can be used on darker skins, after her first spray she instantly saw her complexion evened out and her skin tone lifted - she was heard screaming "I LOVE IT!".'

Contrary to popular belief, for healthy-looking Mark Wright, this was his first experience of fake tan, too. 

'Mark Wright amazingly had never had a spray tan before, I told him he was a shame on Essex, he laughed and in he got – his jaw hit the floor at the results and he couldn’t believe how natural it looked,' said Jules.

'Judy Murray also loves her spray tans - we give her light glows to complement her truly Celtic skin, she’s absolutely loving being so glamorous,' he added.

And as for the biggest tanning addict of Strictly 2014? The crown for this year’s ‘Tanning King’ goes to BBC Radio 1’s Scott Mills, who apparently can’t wait to get in the spray booth each week.

Jules said: 'Scott Mills loves his spray tans, but we’ve had to devise a totally different schedule for him as he misses his slots during rehearsals due to his show. Luckily Scott lives close to me so I can be at his for a treatment at the drop of a hat.'

Since the bronzed and buffed class of Strictly 2014 stepped onto the dance floor in September, the self tanning brand  has seen a dramatic 230 per cent increase in sales of their tanning products - dubbed ‘the Strictly effect’. 

Strictly fans across the UK are queuing up at tanning counters in order to recreate the golden skin of their favourite celebrities as they light up the dance floor each weekend.

Pals: Jules is very close with Millie Mackintosh and does her tan for special occasions
