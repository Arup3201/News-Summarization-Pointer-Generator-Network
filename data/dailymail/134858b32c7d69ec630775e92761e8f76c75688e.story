Houston Rockets forward Chandler Parsons may have had to let down a fan when she asked him to prom, but he made sure she had a memorable evening.

The 6ft 9in basketball player sent a party bus to take Stephanie Flores and her friends to their dance.

Parsons was first contacted by Stephanie on Twitter a few weeks ago, as she tried to convince him to escort her to prom on May 31.

When her first messages went unnoticed, she encouraged her Twitter followers to help get her noticed by sending messages to Parsons.

After her sister Monica sent a tweet to Parsons saying: 'My sis wants to make her dream come true by having you escort her to prom! She'd even love just a response,' the player contacted the teenager.

In a tweet he thanked her for the invite
but explained he wouldn't be in Houston on prom night, before adding: 
'I hope you have a great time!! Be safe.'

Not to be outdown by Miami Heat's player Dwayne Wade, who turned up at a fan's prom last month to give her roses and hug, Parsons planned a special treat for the teenager.

Stephanie, who had been excited to even receive a response from her sporting hero, was astounded when the Houston Rockets and Parsons then sent the sleek party bus for her and her friends to enjoy.

She took to Twitter to post a picture of her posing outside the party bus in her prom dress, and with a Rockets' foam finger and towel.

In a final message she tweeted to Parsons: 'Thank you so much for making my prom even more exciting! My friends and I are extremley grateful for the party bus!'
