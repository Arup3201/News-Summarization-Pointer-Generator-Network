It was also at the centre of a police inquiry in 2012 after more than 100 teenagers broke into the mansion and held a party, during which a Pablo Picasso lithograph worth $30,000 was stolen.

Originally, the Government asked for $6.45million for the mansion, but its required repairs were estimated to cost $1million. The buyer, who remains unnamed, ended up forking out $5.05million.

Sitting on a 17-acre lot, the stunning mansion features  a media room, a 200-foot-long ballroom and bar, a game room, nine full baths and two half baths, according toSFGate.

It also includes a gym, a library, four swimming pools with a waterfall, a pool house, a tennis court, a children's playground and a separate au-pair suite.

Meanwhile, the owner can park their array of luxury vehicles in the four-car garage, as well as enjoying the use of a helicopter landing pad.

After building the mansion, Shipsey lived in it for six years before being convicted of embezzling nearly $1million from union pensions in 1997.

Following his departure, Lazarenko - who has been ranked the 'eighth-most corrupt official in the world' by an international watchdog group - moved into the property.

1991 - Designer George Michael Shipsey lives in the mansion for six years, before being convicted of embezzling nearly $1million from union pensions in 1997.

1997 - Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko moves into the property.

2006 - Lazarenko is handed a nine-year prison sentence for charges of fraud, money laundering and trafficking in stolen goods. The mansion is seized by the U.S. Government.

2006-onwards - Mansion is rented out to numerous tenants, including Hollywood actor Eddie Murphy. 

2012 - The property hits the headlines again after a rare Pablo Picasso lithograph is stolen, along with laptops, candlesticks and leather jackets, during an elicit teen party.

September 2014 - The U.S. Government sells the mansion to an unnamed buyer for just $5.05million.

While there, he was convicted of fraud, money laundering and trafficking in stolen goods, which saw him embezzle around $200million from the Government of Ukraine, according to the United Nations.

He was handed an amended nine-year prison sentence in August 2006 and the property was seized by the U.S. Government. 

In subsequent years, the mansion was rented by a number of tenants, including Murphy, who stayed there while shooting a movie.

In 2012, the property hit the headlines again after the Picasso lithograph was stolen, along with laptops, candlesticks and leather jackets, during the elicit teen party on May 27.

Incredibly, two weeks later, the artwork was found propped up against a fence by hiker Greg Atamaniuk, who was walking half a mile from the mansion and instantly recognised the print.

At the time, Mr Atamaniuk, who then called the police, told the Marin Independent Journal: 'It's something that you don't find usually on your morning hikes.' 

Novato police Sgt. Eric Riddell added: 'It appears the unknown suspect(s), placed the painting there and intended it to be found.'

The 1957 artwork, which is entitled Femme au Chignon and depicts a woman with her hair pulled into a bun, was reported missing by a caretaker on May 28, the day after the teens broke in for the party.

The lithograph was one of 50 prints sharing the title Femme au Chignon, or woman with bun.

During the break in, the teenagers entered the house and managed to get away before officers could arrest anyone, Novato police Sgt. Eric Riddell said.

A caretaker, who has not been identified, notified police officers after he found the teens drinking in the property. Three teens returned a day later and, once again, escaped before authorities arrived.

They had gotten in and basically ransacked multiple rooms in the house,' Riddell told the newspaper.

The county of Marin later filed claims on the property to collect $2.1 million in back taxes and late payment fines.
