Two gay bars are embroiled in a bitter courtroom battle over the right to be 'queer'.

Nigel Martin-Smith, the music promoter who formed Take That in 1990, is suing the owners of a recently-launched venue in Birmingham called 'Queer Street' in the High Court.

He claims they are exploiting the reputation of Bar Queer, a bar and club on Canal Street in Manchester's Gay Village, which he has owned through companies since it opened in 2003.

Copycat? Gay venue Queer Street opened in September in Birmingham

Suing: Mr Martin-Smith has owned Bar Queer, a popular venue on Manchester's Canal Street, since 2003

Mr Martin-Smith contacted his lawyers in September last year, when The Nightingale (UK) Ltd, a company headed by the director of Birmingham Gay Pride, Lawrence Barton, opened ‘Queer Street’, in Hurst Street, Birmingham.

The music mogul was complaining about the use of the word 'queer' by the new bar.

In a High Court writ issued by Bar Queer Ltd, barrister, Robert Onslow, says the venue 'has accrued goodwill in its business which has become exclusively denoted by the word "Queer"'.

He argues that as much as £60,000-a-month has been spent on fortifying the bar’s reputation by advertising in the gay press and magazines since it opened.

Mr Onslow claims the 'exclusive goodwill' attached to the word 'Queer' 'extends nationally', is the property of the Manchester bar and Queer Street is causing public confusion.

Not happy: Music promoter, Nigel Martin-Smith, who formed Take That, right, feels his Manchester bar has accrued 'goodwill' since it opened in 2003 which his Birmingham rival is exploiting

The former boyband manager is demanding an injunction requiring the 'obliteration' of the word 'Queer' from 'all articles and premises' in connection with the Birmingham bar, along with damages and legal costs.

The barrister added that Bar Queer’s goodwill could be 'tarnished and diluted' unless its Birmingham rival is forced to change its name.

Andrew Norris, for the owners of Queer Street, disputes that Bar Queer’s goodwill exends across the UK and says in his clients’ defence: 'It is denied that the Queer Street name and logo give rise to a likelihood of deception in the minds of the relevant public.

'The only element common to the name and logo of both bars is the word Queer. Both bars are directed towards the gay community. The word Queer is commonly and colloquially understood as describing someone who is gay, thus Queer in these circumstances has a descriptive meaning.

'References to queer bars or nightclubs would be understood by members of the relevant public to be a reference to a bar or nightclub that was directed to members of the gay and lesbian community.

'It is admitted that a bar has traded in Manchester under and by reference to the name QUEER for several years. It is admitted that the bar has acquired a reputation and goodwill in the gay community in and around Manchester. It is denied that any such goodwill extends throughout the UK.

'If the claimant is the owner of the alleged goodwill, it had only limited value,' concludes Mr Norris.
