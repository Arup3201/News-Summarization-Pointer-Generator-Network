Red faced police chiefs have been forced to put out a stolen vehicle alert – after one of their cars was taken from the driveway of an officer’s house.

A Metropolitan Police officer parked the unmarked blue Skoda Superb estate outside his home in Brentwood, Essex, on Thursday, but that night a thief broke in to the house and snatched the car keys.

The £25,000 vehicle is fitted with discreet blue lights and two-tone horns. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We want to make motorists aware this car is not being driven by a police officer so they should not pull over if requested to do so by the driver.

‘The driver is likely to be the individual who stole it.’
