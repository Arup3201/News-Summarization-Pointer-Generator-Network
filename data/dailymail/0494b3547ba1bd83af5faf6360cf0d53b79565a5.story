There are plenty of good moments to catch some extra sleep while on your way to work in the morning, but perhaps while falling out of your seat isn't one of them.

However, stunned commuters on the Underground in London watched an exhausted worker doing exactly that.

Passengers on the central line filmed the man as he snoozed away with his arms folded across his chest, seemingly unaware that he was halfway to the floor.

As the train carriage sways along the Tube tunnel, the man wobbles from side to side but amazingly manages to stay upright.

In true Underground style, nobody dares look at the man, and instead awkwardly look away as he sleeps with his legs in the isle.
