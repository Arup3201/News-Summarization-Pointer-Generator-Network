An actress pleaded guilty today to sending ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg after telling the FBI her husband was responsible.

Shannon Guess Richardson, a mother-of-six who has had minor roles in 'The Walking Dead' and 'The Blind Side', entered the plea in Texarkana, Texas in a bid to her cap prison time at 18 years.

Richardson, 35, was arrested in June after 
authorities said she tried to implicate her then husband, Nathan 
Richardson, after he had filed for divorce.

Prosecutors claimed Shannon Richardson 
mailed three letters from New Boston, outside Texarkana, then went to 
police and claimed that her husband had done it.

Plea: Shannon Richardson, pictured after a court appearance arrest in June, has pleaded guilty to sending ricin letters to President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and blaming it on her husband

She told investigators she found a suspicious substance in their refrigerator as well as addresses for Bloomberg and Obama written on a note on his desk.

The
letter that was sent to Obama, according to a federal indictment, said: 'What's in 
this letter is nothing compared to what ive got in store for you mr 
president.'

But prosecutors said investigators noted inconsistencies in Richardson's statements and later learned that she had purchased materials online to produce ricin, a toxin that can cause respiratory failure if inhaled.

She was charged with one count of possessing and producing a biological toxin.

Poses: Her husband said Shannon, who had had minor roles in TV shoes, had always wanted to be famous

Blamed: After sending the ricin letters to Obama and Bloomberg, she allegedly called the FBI and said that she had found notes written by her husband Nathaniel (right) to the president

Her attorney, Tonda Curry, said last month that she and prosecutors agreed to a deal capping Richardson's sentence at 18 years.

Prosecutors say Richardson faces life in prison for the charge to which she pleaded guilty.

A federal judge ultimately will sentence Richardson at a later sentencing hearing, which has not yet been scheduled.

'Shannon is anxious to admit her role in ordering the components to make the ricin, her role in the letters that contained the ricin, and to tell the government who else was involved in those offenses,' Curry said.

Curry did not say more about Richardson's possible motives or whom she might name.

While in custody earlier this year, 
she gave birth to her sixth child, who is now in the custody of her 
ex-husband. Attorney John Delk said that the baby weighed less than two 
pounds when it was born.

Probe: Investigators can be seen outside the couple's home in New Boston, Texas in June

Locked up: Richardson's lawyer said the plea deal is expected to cap her sentence at 18 years

Richardson already has five children from previous relationships, age 4 to 19.

Her husband Mr Richardson, an army veteran, has said she was desperate to become famous.

'She really wanted to be an actress,' he told ABC News in an interview in June. 'She wanted to get her face out there.'

Ricin, a highly toxic substance, is found naturally in castor beans, but it takes a deliberate act to manufacture it and use it to poison people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Exposure to even a small amount of ricin can cause death and no known antidote exists.
