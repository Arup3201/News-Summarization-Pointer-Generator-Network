The handyman who walked into a police station and admitted to strangling the wife of a wealthy Detroit businessman was released from jail Friday afternoon because authorities claimed they didn't have the evidence to charge him with murder.

The release of Joseph Gentz, despite his confession, is just the latest bizarre twist in the unfolding murder mystery of Jane Bashara, who was found dead January 25 in her Mercedes SUV eight miles from her home in the wealthy Detroit suburb of Gross Pointe Park.

Gross Pointe Park police offered no 
explanation as to why they let Gentz go, saying only: 'Our job as 
investigators is to prove facts beyond a reasonable doubt. In doing so, 
we must conduct a thorough and complete investigation.'

Gentz reportedly told police he killed Mrs Bashara after her husband Bob hired him as a hitman.

Free man: Joseph Gentz was released from jail, despite confessing to murdering Jane Bashara. He claimed he was hired as a hitman by Mrs Bashara's husband Bob

When police began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Police named Mr Bashara the lone 'person of interest' in the case, but he denies he had anything to do with his wife's murder.

Instead, his lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible.

Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death.

Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family.

'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press.

Strangled: Jane Bashara was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 eight miles away from her home. Bob, right, is said to have been having an affair

'I was horrified because he said he killed dear Jane. I was scared and I wanted some protection over here.'

Mr Bashara's lawyer said he requested police protection and surveillance for his house a a result of Gentz going free.

The attorney, Mr Griem, says he expects Joseph Gentz, who claims he was 
hired by Bob to murder Jane, to be charged for her murder.

Painting a possible scenario Mr Griem 
told a press conference that Gentz was owed about $2,000 by Mr Bashara, and
may have turned up at the house to collect his money.

He
imagined: 'A dispute arose over billing demands made on Bob Bashara by 
Joe. Discussions got heated in the past month,' 'My scenario is Jane 
pulls into her driveway, Joe walks up demanding money, and an argument 
ensues.'

Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge

Griem hypothesized that Gentz could have startled Jane in the garage, causing her to shout and, reacting in anger,  Gentz could have killed her.

'From what we've been told [about the] cause of Jane's death, it would seem that would be the type of thing that could happen between two people,' ABC reported.

 Gentz could  be charged by Grosse Pointe Park police today, otherwise they would be forced to release him after his 72-hour holding period expired.

Gentz walked into a police station earlier this week to admit his part in the murder. He said he acted as the hit man.

Police had found a cheque from Bashara to Gentz the day before Jane's death.

'If there's a trial, that's going to be exhibit one for the defense,' Griem said today. 'Who would ever consider hiring a hit man with a cheque signed by that individual?'

Griem claimed that Bashara had passed a private polygraph test.

Investigators also confirmed they found a 'sex dungeon' in the basement of a property owned by Bob Bashara.

The room, filled with whips, chains and a bed, sits beneath the Hard Luck Lounge in Grosse Pointe Park - where Bashara was drinking on the night his wife was killed.

Rebecca Delodder and others who live near the Hard Luck Lounge told WJBK-TV that Bob Bashara was often seen coming in and out of the basement over the past few years.

Griem insisted reports of the alleged affair and S&M lifestyle were not relevant to theb case and could prejudice any future trial.

'Whether or not Bob has an alternative lifestyle, that doesn't make him a criminal. That doesn't make him a wife killer. What it does, it makes it very difficult for us to get a fair trial if he's charged,' Griem told ABC News.

A tow truck driver found 56-year-old Jane Bashara's body eight miles from her affluent home in the upscale 
suburb of Grosse Point in a rundown part of Detroit.

Her
husband had reported the mother missing the night before when he said 
he returned from work to find her missing but the TV and lights on.

Police
also confirmed that Mrs Bashara was murdered at her home and then 
dumped in her car before being driven to a run-down area of Detroit.

Broken fingernails and bruises on her body were a sign that she 
'fought for her life'.

On the evening she died, Bashara told police he spoke to his wife on the phone, but records show this was not the case.

He had been at the Hard Luck Lounge drinking rum and coke when a man - said to be Gentz - arrived and joined him for a drink around 7.30pm, according to a police source.

The Detroit Free Press reported that Bashara and his mistress were looking at a 3,300-square-foot house, a five-minute drive
from his home off Middlesex Road. The five bedroom house had an asking price of almost $245,000.

Bashara initially told police about the night his wife died: 'I got home and she wasn’t 
around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Bob 
Bashara told 7 Action News on Thursday.

'As
9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more 
people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard 
from her and they hadn’t.

'I
had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I 
involved the police because I was concerned there might be something 
wrong.'

After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing.

Speaking to the Detroit Free Press last week, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and 
did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere.

'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through
in the last moments of her life.'

Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company.

The Detroit News reported that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities.

'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7. 'It's hard on their kids to hear something like that. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was not him.'
