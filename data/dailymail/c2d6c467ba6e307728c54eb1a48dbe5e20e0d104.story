A fugitive treasure hunter who allegedly failed to pay back his investors after discovering the greatest lost treasure in U.S. history has been arrested in Florida after more than two years on the lam.

Tommy Thompson, 62, and his long-time companion Alison Anteike were found on Tuesday in their two-person suite at a Hilton in West Boca Raton, where they had been living for two years, and were taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals Service.

The duo are awaiting a hearing in Florida before being extradited to Ohio, where a federal civil arrest warrant was issued in 2012 after Thompson failed to show up to a court hearing, said Brian Babtist, a senior inspector with the U.S. Marshals in Columbus.

Thompson made history in 1988 when he found the sunken S.S. Central America, also known as the Ship of Gold.

The vessel sank in a huge hurricane 200 miles off South Carolina in September 1857, claiming the lives of 425 people and thousands of pounds of California gold, contributing to an economic panic.

But in 1988, Thompson and his crew brought up thousands of gold bars and coins from the shipwreck, in what was considered a technological feat at the time.

Much of the gold was later sold to a gold marketing group in 2000 for about $50 million. 

But the 161 investors who paid Thompson $12.7 million to find the ship never saw returns from the sale. Two of them sued - a now-deceased investment firm president and the Dispatch Printing Company, which publishes The Columbus Dispatch newspaper and had invested about $1 million.

That legal battle is ongoing, and those close to Thompson say it was his undoing.

Gil Kirk, who heads a Columbus real estate firm and is a former director of one of Thompson's companies, told The Associated Press last year that Thompson never cheated anyone.

Kirk said proceeds from the 2000 sale of the gold all went to legal fees and bank loans.

'He was a genius, and they've stolen his life,' Kirk said of those who sued.

Thompson went into seclusion in 2006, moving into a mansion called Gracewood in Vero Beach, Florida. Six years later, after the arrest warrant was issued, Thompson vanished.

When the property's caretakers searched it soon afterward, they found prepaid disposable cellphones and bank wraps for $10,000, along with a bank statement in the name of Harvey Thompson - his nickname in college.

The statement showed a $1 million balance, a real estate agent for the property said in court records.

Caretakers also found a book called 'How to Live Your Life Invisible.' One marked page was titled: 'Live your life on a cash-only basis.'

Columbus attorney Rick Robol, who at one time defended Thompson's company, has said there's no proof Thompson stole anything. He said he's been concerned about Thompson's health, which is why he called the arrest 'the best thing that can happen for everybody.'

No criminal charges have been filed against Thompson, but Babtist said the treasure hunter will likely be ordered held in custody until he appears before an Ohio judge to give an accounting for the gold's sale and his actions.

'I don't imagine he's going to get any bond because he's already been a fugitive and knowingly evaded law enforcement,' Babtist said.

'I don't know what kind of means he has as far as money goes, but I'm sure they don't want to take any chances with him leaving the country or absconding again.' 

Found: He was finally tracked down to a Hilton hotel in West Boca Raton, where he had lived for two years
