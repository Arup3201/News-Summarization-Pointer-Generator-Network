It is a problem that affects some five million Britons. But tinnitus – or at least the risk of developing it – could be tackled by drinking three or more coffees a day.

The findings, from a study involving nearly 70,000 women, suggest caffeine may have a protective effect against the condition – a constant ringing in the ears that can drive some victims to suicide.

Decaffeinated coffee did not have the same benefit.

Pain: Tinnitus is a crippling condition - but could be treated by drinking coffee, a controversial study suggests

Researchers in Canada who tracked coffee-drinking habits in middle-aged women found those who drank three to four cups a day were 15 per cent less likely to develop tinnitus and those on more than four cups were 20 per cent less at risk.

The results, published in the American Journal of Medicine, are controversial because it was thought that too much caffeine made the ringing worse.

But after a 2010 study found tinnitus 
sufferers who cut caffeine out of their diets saw no improvement, with 
some actually getting worse, scientists decided to look at whether the 
world’s most widely-consumed stimulant might be beneficial.

Rock chick: There are fears loud music gigs could put young people's hearing at risk

Tinnitus is caused by nerve damage in the inner ear. It can be caused by exposure to loud music, an ear infection or even a cold.

The damage results in an abnormal stream of impulses that the brain interprets as constant sound.

Many of us suffer temporary tinnitus that lasts no more than a few hours, often from a cold or from going to a loud concert.

But for around one in 100 people, it becomes a long-term affliction.

Experts
 fear growing numbers of younger people are being affected, due to a 
gradual rise in noise levels generally and the use of earphones at high 
volumes.

There is no cure but treatments include counselling and relaxation techniques.

This is where patients listen to 
background noise, such as gentle music, waves crashing on a shore or 
even the hum of traffic, to distract their attention away from the 
tinnitus.

In 2010 rock fan Robert 
McIndoe, from south-east London, stabbed himself to death after he 
suffered months of constant ringing in his ears from attending a concert
 by the band Them Crooked Vultures.

The
 married father-of-two, who was 52 when he died, died after repeated unsuccessful attempts to get treatment.

Experts at the University of Western Ontario and at Harvard School of Public Health came up with their theory after analysing data from one of the world’s biggest studies into women’s health.

Puzzling: Researchers admitted they are baffled by how caffeine might prevent tinnitus, but said it may have something to do with how the stimulant affects delicate hair cells in the inner ear

The Nurses Health Study II detailed the health and lifestyle habits of more than 65,000 nurses in the US. All were aged between 30 and 44 at the beginning of the study. Over 18 years, more than 5,000 went on to develop tinnitus.

Researchers admitted they are baffled by how caffeine might prevent tinnitus but said it may have something to do with how the stimulant affects delicate hair cells in the inner ear.

They said further research is also needed before doctors can recommend increasing caffeine intake and to confirm that men may benefit in the same way as women.

In a report on their findings they said: ‘Higher caffeine intake was associated with a reduced risk of tinnitus.

‘The majority - approximately 70 per cent – of caffeine intake was from coffee consumption but we did not find an association with decaffeinated coffee.

‘This suggests it is caffeine rather than another component of coffee that was associated with a decreased incidence of tinnitus.’
