At long last, the shadows are lifting. Garrett, the Master Thief is back with this announcement trailer for Eidos-Montreal's next title: THIEF.

And unluckily for current-gen owners, it is in development for the new wave of consoles and PC. There is still no word on whether it will feature on Xbox 360 and PS3.

Now you see him, now you don't: The Thief games have had a huge impact on the 'sneak-em-up' genre, inspiring games such as Splinter Cell and the more recent Dishonored

There is a rising tide of fear in The City. Hatred saturates every stone and whilst the rich prosper, the less fortunate face misery and repression. Ravaged with sickness and famine, they wait for something to change.

Similar to last year's hit, Dishonored, THIEF is a first-person adventure featuring intelligent design that allows players to take full control. Expect levels to be 'slightly sandbox', giving you the freedom to forge your own path through the game.

Garrett is rumoured to have a 'Focus' mode, which enhances his vision and highlights objects of interest. It can also slow down time, making pickpocketing easier.

Expect weapons such as the blackjack, compound bow and claw (for grappling) to feature heavily in the gameplay, too.
