Tottenham's Milos Veljkovic is joining Middlesbrough on a three-month loan deal.

The 19-year-old is set to stay at the Riverside Stadium until January initially but may extend the loan until the end of the season.

The Serbia Under 19 international said: 'Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka called me to talk about the possibility. I am happy to get the chance. In January, a loan could be extended to the end of the season.'

Veljkovic plays in the Under 21s for Spurs at Liverpool last April but has struggled to break into the first team

Veljkovic, who can play in defence or midfield, has featured twice for Spurs after coming on as a substitute in matches against Sunderland and Aston Villa at the back end of last season.

But chances have proved limited under new manager Mauricio Pochettino, with Veljkovic failing to appear in any competition this season leaving his first team opportunities limited at White Hart Lane.

Middlesbrough have enjoyed a positive start to their Championship campaign and sit just a point off the top in fifth place after 11 games as they target a first return to the Premier League since 2009.
