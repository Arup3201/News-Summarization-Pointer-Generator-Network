With its heady mix of romance, villainy and a quest for a diamond that once belonged to Blackbeard, new Sky One drama Moonfleet is the quintessential swashbuckling tale.

Starring Ray Winstone as loveable rogue Elzevir, the drama also introduces newcomer Sophie Cookson as the beautiful Grace Mohune who gets an unexpectedly personal look at the world of smuggling when she falls for Elzevir's protegee John Trenchard (Aneurin Barnard).

But while Grace is fictional, the women who inhabited the often-terrifying world of 18th century smuggling gangs were not - and frequently, they were just as frightening as the men.

Notorious: 18th century smuggler and pirate Anne Bonney made a career from seafaring crime

The earliest recorded female smugglers were Anne Bonney and Mary Read who eventually graduated from trading in counterfeit goods to full-blown piracy.

Bonney, who was born to a poor Irish family in Cork in 1702, became particularly notorious - largely as a result of her relationship with fellow pirate and smuggler, Jack 'Calico Jack' Rackham.

Together with Rackham and Read, an Englishwoman who had, while disguised as a man, fought in the Royal Navy, she stole a ship named the Revenge and rampaged up and down the Caribbean, harrying British shipping and sneaking illicit goods under the noses of local officials.

But unlike Grace, who gets her happy ending eventually, Read and Bonney did not. By 1720, the pair were on the run and were eventually taken by pirate hunter, Captain Jonathan Barnet while enjoying a rum party with another English pirate crew off the coast of Jamaica.

Although both women escaped the rope by pleading pregnancy, the pair ended their lives in squalid Jamaican prisons - in Read's case, less than a year after her arrival.

While Read and Bonney are among the most famous, most female smugglers led considerably less colourful lives.

In the 18th century, smuggling was rife in the UK, largely thanks to the introduction of the excise tax - introduced in 1688 to help pay for the English Civil War.

Danger: Although Grace's tale finishes well, most smugglers ended their days in prison or penal colonies

Initially, it applied only to chocolate, coffee, tea, beer, cider and spirits but was later widened to include salt, leather, and soap.

Worse, parliamentarians were unable to resist increasing it and by the mid 18th century, taxes on tea had skyrocketed to 70 per cent.

As a result, smuggling gangs boomed, with women among those flocking to join them.

Much of the contraband trade was focused around the south coast, including Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Dorset, where Moonfleet is set.

As Robert Louis Stevenson writes in Kidnapped: 'Few places on the British coast did not claim to be the haunts of wreckers or mooncussers.

'The thievery was boasted about and romanticised until it seemed a kind of heroism. It did not have any taint of criminality and the whole of the south coast had pockets vying with one another over whose smugglers were the darkest or most daring.

'The Smugglers Inn was one of the commonest names for a bar on the coast.'

Although barred from most of the more dangerous and arduous roles, women would work alongside the men to dilute illegally imported brandy before selling it on, or would gather and dry leaves to blend with smuggled batches of tea.

Later, as magistrates and law enforcers devised better ways to spot illegal cargo, women were, according to Marie-Louise Jensen, author of historical novel Smuggler's Kiss, used to help sneak illicit cargo into the country using their voluminous skirts to conceal the contraband.

Even alcohol could be hidden under layers of petticoats; decanted into a pig's bladder which was then tied around the waist under the skirt.

Sadly, like Read and Bonney, Britain's female smugglers rarely got their happy ending. Punishments were severe and most of those caught faced lengthy periods in jail or even transportation to Australia.

Although Moonfleet's John Trenchard eventually makes it home to his love, for many 18th century jailbirds, an Australian penal colony really was the end of the adventure.
