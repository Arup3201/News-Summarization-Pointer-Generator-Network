A widow who lost her husband to cancer three years ago is now fighting a battle with Hallmark to create end-of-life sympathy cards.

Activist and artist Regina Holliday has been petitioning for the immensely popular card company to create a line of hospice cards that are meant to say goodbye to friends, loved ones, and acquaintances. 

Though the greeting card company has plenty of ‘Get Well Soon’ cards and sympathy cards if the worst should happen, there are no cards specifically designed for someone in terminal care.

Available options now: Two current options from Hallmark's 'Get Well Soon' section, neither of which Mrs Holliday believes appropriate for a person who is terminally ill

Speaking to MailOnline from her home in Washington, Mrs Holliday said that she hopes to change the way the card giant looks at end of life, saying that the flow of cards to her husband Fred stopped as soon as he was moved into hospice care for his terminal liver cancer.

Fear of the unknown: Mrs Holliday says thatnot knowing what to say or how to say it stops many people from sending cards to people in hospice care

‘When my husband Fred and I were in rehab, we had all these great cards saying fight the good fight, you can do it, cheering you on, thinking you could actually have an effect on cancer.’

But when Mr Holliday’s cancer worsened and he was moved to hospice, the flow of well-wishes and cards stopped abruptly. ‘People didn’t know what to say,’ the mother of two explained.

‘Some people would send “Thinking of You” and a few sent “Our Deepest Sympathy” cards. My husband actually chortled and said, “I’m not dead yet!”’

Mr Holliday passed away from cancer on June 17, 2009.

Mrs Holliday, who worked several years at a retail store that sold greeting cards, said she started working on the idea when her husband was still alive. 

Adding a row of cards clearly labled as ‘end of life,’ she said, will show people there’s an option for that difficult time in life, and start a dialogue on how to say goodbye to loved ones. 

‘People are scared to say goodbye. And because they’re so scared, they don’t do it,’ she said. 

Mrs Holliday wrote on her blog that Hallmark did not recognize the word ‘hospice’ or ‘end of life’ in its search engine, instead pointing out a card for a Bat Mitzvah.

According to ABC News, Mrs Holliday tried for a year to get in touch with company representatives to address End of Life cards.

Loss: Fred Holliday was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer and passed away in 2009 in hospice care

Options: In response to Mrs Holliday's request, Hallmark offered a series of cards like these; the widow points out that the card on the right still doesn't have the right message

In her latest effort, she created the Change.org petition, which has more than 3,200 supporters.

Finally, Hallmark introduced nine greeting cards specifically for people in hospice care.

One card features a curly script with the words ‘Caring thoughts are with you’ on the cover.

Inside, the card reads: ‘Nothing can ease the difficulty of what is happening in your life, but every day – you are wished a little peace of mind.’

Another more twee card shows an illustrated sheep with the accompanying text: ‘I’m not sure what to do, I’m not sure what to say… But one things’ for sure – I promise to pray!’

'I began advocacy before Fred died. He 
saw this beginning and he's incredibly proud. He got to see that and I 
know he’d be so happy.'

Another one reads: ‘Cancer is tough, but you are tougher!’

Mrs Holliday told MailOnline that while this is a step in the right direction, the message is still off, especially to patients who are not religious or who simply will not win the battle against the disease.

‘If you’re going to talk about win and lose, cancer just won,’ she said, adding that people may mean well with their words of encouragement, they may not be the words a very ill person wants to hear.

Hallmark spokesperson Linda Odell told MailOnline that while it is true the company doesn't carry cards 'that specifically say "hospice," we do have quite a few that address the need Mrs Holliday has quite accurately expressed tp provide support and care for people at the end of life.'

She added that many of Hallmark's cards can be personalized 'if the suggested message is not quite what the individual is looking for.'

The company also wrote in a recent news release that they have ‘nearly 100 cards to help people share words of support for a range of life situations, including cancer treatment, terminal illness, grief support, recovery/rehab, and other difficult times, as well as cards for caregivers.’

The new line of hospice care cards will be appearing in Hallmark Gold Crown stores throughout the year. 

‘I began advocacy before Fred died. He saw this beginning and he’s incredibly proud. He got to see that and I know he’d be so happy. 

‘Before we hit hospice, it was the worst part of our lives, and I’m so glad that I can do this for him,’ she said.
