Ceefax will take its final bow tonight as the beloved text service succumbs to the final stage of the UK's switch to digital television broadcasts.

The world's first teletext service will finally end after 38 years on the BBC when Olympic champion Dame Mary Peters switches off analogue transmissions in Northern Ireland.

As the corporation prepared to finally pull the plug on the service, the Plain English Campaign announced a lifetime achievement award for its 'clarity' and use of 'everyday words'

One of the very last pages from Ceefax to air on BBC Two: The service will finally be switched off in Northern Ireland tonight after 38 years of broadcasts on the BBC

Former prime minister Sir John Major said it would be 'much missed' and could be 'proud of its record' of offering an 'instant window on the world'.

Launched September 23 1974, Ceefax gave viewers the chance to check the latest headlines, weather forecasts and TV listings in a pre-internet era where the only alternative was to wait for the next bulletin to be aired.

Initially developed by BBC engineers looking for ways to transmit subtitles, Ceefax was made possible by exploiting 'spare lines' in the analogue television signal that broadcast encoded information.

Its first editor was veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, a former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer who initally updated 24 news pages himself by feeding punch tape into machines.

Breakthrough: Prior to the launch of the service viewers who wanted to find out details of news headlines had wait for the next television or radio news broadcast

Olympics 1984: The popularity of the service grew slowly at first, until the Eighties when millions invested in new teletext-enabled TVs

With few Ceefax-capable television 
sets in use at the UK at the time of its launch, the popularity of the 
service grew slowly until the Eighties when millions invested in new 
teletext-enabled TVs.

The 
full service at this time included recipes for dishes prepared on BBC 
cookery programmes, share prices, music reviews, Blue Peter project 
how-to's and an annual advent calendar.

Audience
figures peaked in the Nineties when Ceefax had 20million users who 
checked it at least once a week - but with the internet revolution just 
around the corner the popularity of the service would not last.

The
launch of the UK's digital television signal, which can carry much more
information, and the announcement of the staged switch-off of the 
analogue TV signal tolled the death knell for the service.

End of an era: Special broadcasts will tonight mark the end of the Ceefax service

BBC Northern Ireland and UTV will tonight screen a simulcast reviewing the era of analogue TV and Dame Mary Peters - 1972 Olympic gold medallist in the pentathlon - will push the button ending the transmission at 11:30.

These days when online journalists want to publish stories, all they have to do is click a button on screen to make a story live and viewable by readers all across the planet.

By comparison, the early days of Ceefax proved anything but hi-tech.

Journalists at the BBC Newsroom would monitor stories coming in on the wires, and when a story was to be updated they would type at a production terminal to create a Ceefax page.

Then they had to produce a yard-long punched tape before running down two flights of stairs to the BBC's Central Apparatus Room and load into a reader which actually transmitted the pages.

After returning to the news room they checked for mistakes. If, at that point, a spelling mistake was found the journalist had to go through the whole process again.

Viewers can check Ceefax itself during the evening to see a special graphics countdown on page 100. Meanwhile BBC weather presenters will pay tribute to the service by using Ceefax-type pixelated maps on the forecasts.

The Plain English campaign also paid tribute to the service with a lifetime achievement award recognising its commitment to communicating information to viewers as quickly and clearly as possible.

Responding to the accolade Steve Herrmann, editor of the BBC News website, said: 'It is an honour for us to receive this lifetime achievement award, and it stands as a tribute to all the journalists who have worked on the service over the years, and the care they have taken in writing every story.'

Former prime minister Sir John Major, who has previously told how he checked Ceefax pages to keep up to date with cricket scores between Downing Street meetings said the service will be 'much missed'.

'At moments of high pressure - with little time for detailed examination of the news - Ceefax headlines offered an instant window on the world,' he said.

'From breaking global news to domestic sports news, Ceefax was speedy, accurate and indispensable. It can be proud of its record.'
