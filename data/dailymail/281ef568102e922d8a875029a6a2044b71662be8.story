A teenage brother and sister have been jailed for orchestrating a 'revenge rape' on a young girl after telling her: 'snitches get stitches'.

Aliyah Weekes, 19, instigated a sex attack carried out by her younger brother in an alleyway on the 15-year-old victim, who she accused of spreading rumours.

She was sentenced to four-and-a-half years' detention in a young offenders institute today for her role in what a judge called a 'truly wicked' crime.

Her 18-year-old brother Lacquan Weekes, who carried out the attack, was detained for five years at the Old Bailey after he was found guilty of rape following a trial.

Aliyah Weekes and a 16-year-old girl were also convicted of aiding and abetting the attack. The youngest defendant was spared a custodial sentence and given a youth rehabilitation order for 18 months.

Sentencing the trio, Judge Jeremy Donne said: 'This was no game. This was no childish folly. This was a wicked crime and one that Aliyah Weekes, you determined upon over the space of about an hour during which the victim was detained.'

The sex attack happened after the victim confronted by the two girls in a park in Willesden, north-west London in April.

The victim was forced into an alleyway and made to perform a sex act on Lacquan Weekes, while a group of youths watched nearby.

Judge Donne said: 'This was a revenge rape and this poor girl was being punished. She was accused of spreading stories. Her explanations were rejected.

'She was very distressed throughout this. She must have been terrified. To compound her fear was the added humiliation that all of this was happening before a group of other youths who were nearby. This was a truly wicked offence.'

The judge said he held Aliyah Weekes 'principally responsible' for the incident, which he said would not have happened without her involvement.

She had told the victim 'snitches get stitches' when she accused the victim of telling secrets about her and the 16-year-old. The victim was also threatened with being put through an even more horrific ordeal.

The judge said  Aliyah Weekes was 'principally responsible' and the court heard Lacquan Weekes poses a 'high risk to the public

In an impact statement, the victim's mother said she had changed from a 'bubbly and carefree' girl to being 'jumpy and withdrawn' with a 'lack of confidence and trust in people'.

Her family had also been targeted in 'acts of intimidation' including having a brick thrown through their window, the court heard.

Lacquan Weekes, of north-west London, smiled and chatted to his sister in the dock as the court heard that he poses a 'high risk' to the public.

The judge said Lacquan Weekes, who has previous convictions for battery and possession of drugs, had shown 'not one iota of remorse' for the crime and said his behaviour while on remand had been 'appalling'.

Paul Stanislas, for Aliyah Weekes, also from north-west London, said she had played 'no more' than an 'instigator role' in the attack. Michael Chambers, for her brother, said he had a 'very troubled background'.

Clare Gordon, representing the youngest defendant, said she neither 'perpetrated nor instigated' the incident.
