Former senator John Edwards launched a verbal attack on his mistress Rielle Hunter when he found out she was pregnant, calling her a 'crazy slut', his former aide testified today.

Taking the stand for the second time, Andrew Young told the court Edwards was 'very angry and concerned' when he found out about the baby in 2007 and told Young there was only a one-in-three chance the baby was his.

He also told the court about the intricate system of check writing used to hide funds given to Edwards my millionaire Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, which he said 'felt and smelled wrong' even though he was assured it was all legal.

It also emerged today that Edwards' 
secret weapon in the trial is his Harvard law graduate daughter Cate - 
who was said to have been whispering legal advice in her father's ear 
throughout jury selection and opening statements - in which the 
prosecution called him a 'master manipulator'.

When Andrew Young returned to the witness stand today, he said he worried about secretly using money from wealthy donors to support the former U.S. Senator's pregnant mistress during the candidate's 2008 presidential bid.

'It just all seemed crazy. It felt and smelled wrong,' he said.

Young is the federal government's key witness in the criminal campaign finance case against Edwards, who failed to capture the Democratic presidential nomination. The former aide was granted immunity from prosecution for his testimony.

Young told jurors how he coordinated three-way phone calls between himself, Edwards and Hunter to keep the affair secret from Edwards' wife, Elizabeth. Hunter also met up with John Edwards at hotels on the campaign trail, Young said.

Hunter for a time worked as a videographer for Edwards' campaign, but she lost her job after Edwards' wife found out about the affair.

Young said he and Edwards tried to 
figure out where they could get money to support her and eventually 
settled on heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, an Edwards admirer who is now 
101.

Mellon had offered to help Edwards 
with campaign expenses after he took a beating in the press for his 
expensive haircuts. Young said he did not tell her the money would be 
used to cover expenses for Edwards' mistress, who had threatened to go 
public about their relationship.

'I told (Mellon) that we had a 
non-campaign expense that would benefit Mr Edwards, and we needed her 
help,' Young told the court.

Mellon eventually wrote seven checks 
totaling $725,000 to her interior decorator. The decorator then sent the
 checks to Young's wife to co-sign using her maiden name, Young said.

In the checks' memo lines, Mellon used descriptions such as 'chairs' and 'antique Charleston table', government exhibits showed.

Edwards says he did not know about 
the money from Mellon, but Young said the two men discussed seeking the 
payments and whether the arrangement using the decorator and Young's 
wife was legitimate for a presidential campaign.

'He said it was completely legal, that it was a non-campaign expense,' Young said.

He has not yet discussed how other payments from campaign finance chairman Fred Baron came about.

Edwards' defense is expected to go 
after Young's credibility during cross-examination. During opening 
statements on Monday, the defense said Young pocketed most of the donor 
money and used it to help bankroll a $1.5 million home for his family.

Young thought Edwards was his 'ticket to the top', the defense said.

When things soured, he recruited others to testify against Edwards in the criminal prosecution, according to the defense.

The defense also tried to undermine him yesterday by revealing that he had a one-night stand with another witness in 2007.

U.S District Court Judge Catherine C. 
Eagles said that former Edwards aide Andrew Young slept with a young 
campaign employee and also contacted three other witnesses in the past 
two weeks to consult with them about their planned testimony.

Prosecutors say Edwards, 58, 
manipulated Young into soliciting more than $900,000 from two wealthy 
donors to hide the affair and pregnancy, and avoid destroying his 
campaign.

They say Young was so dedicated to 
Edwards that he agreed to falsely claim paternity of mistress Rielle 
Hunter's baby at Edwards' request.

According to the New York Post, Cate Andrews sat directly behind her father yesterday in the federal 
courtroom in Greensboro, North Carolina.

Edwards and his attorneys consulted 
with her at least six times in the 45 minutes it took to whittle down 45
 jurors to the final 16, almost making her the fourth member of his 
legal team.

Cate was also active during Edwards 
campaign for presidency in 2008. She temporarily gave up practicing law 
after her mother Elizabeth died from breast cancer in December 2010.

She now runs the Elizabeth Edwards Foundation, which provides educational opportunities to underprivileged children.

The judge ruled that lawyers for Edwards
 could mention the improper contact to
jurors in opening arguments on Monday, but barred them from using the term 
'witness tampering' or telling the jury that Young had a one-night
stand with one of the other witnesses in 2007.

'It wasn't just a marriage on the
line,' said prosecutor David Harbach.

'If the affair went public it
would destroy his chance of becoming president, and he knew it. ...He made a
choice to break the law.'

The judge seated 12 jurors and four alternates Monday morning.

The panel is
made up of nine men and seven women drawn from central North Carolina, the
state that elected Edwards to serve one term in the U.S. Senate.

Each had already given Edwards' campaign the maximum
$2,300 individual contribution allowed by federal law.

Edwards denies having known about the
money, which paid for private jets, luxury hotels and Hunter's medical care.
Prosecutors will seek to prove he sought and directed the payments to cover up
his affair, protect his public image as a 'family man' and keep his
presidential hopes viable.

It is alleged as part of this, Young and his wife invited the pregnant
Hunter to live in their home near Chapel Hill and later embarked with her on a
cross-country odyssey as they sought to elude tabloid reporters trying to
expose the candidate's extramarital affair.

Former aide Young later fell out with Edwards and
wrote an unflattering tell-all book, 'The Politician.'

And just recently, Young and Hunter ended a two-year legal battle over ownership of a sex tape the
mistress recorded with Edwards during the campaign, agreeing to a settlement
that dictates that copies of the video will be destroyed.

While Young is expected to be a witness for
the prosecution, the defense is likely to call Hunter to testify.

After years of adamant public denials,
Edwards acknowledged paternity of Hunter's daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in 2010.

The girl, now 4,
lives with her mother in Charlotte and is visited frequently by Edwards.

And despite rumours Edwards and Hunter were looking to get married, a recent sighting reported to the New York Post claims the one-time secret romance is no more.

The old flames were seen eating together at
 Rooster's Wood Fire Kitchen in Charlotte where they often take their 
daughter Frances Quinn, four, and apparently looked far from a couple in
 love.

A staff member at the restaurant said: 'They
 didn't seem romantic. You would think that they were a married couple 
if you didn’t know them. He sat across from her in a booth.'

Hunter's publicist Rosemarie Terenzio confirmed the couple see each other often but not romantically.

She
 told the Post: 'No, she wasn’t ever engaged to him. They see each other
 often. They raise Quinn together and they do so extremely amicably.'
