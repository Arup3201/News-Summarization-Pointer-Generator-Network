If it was up to Kanye West, we'd all be strutting around in flesh-coloured body stockings next season.

As ridiculous as it may sound, that may well be the case as the musician-come-designer has received an abundance of praise for his range for Adidas from fashion editors, authorities, and influencers.

The collection made its way down the runway on the first day of New York Fashion Week yesterday, comprising of full body stockings, see-through skin-coloured crop tops and visible nude pants. It's certainly a new take on underwear as outerwear - one certainly not for the faint hearted.

The Kanye West Adidas Fall 2015 collection received an abundance of praise from fashion elite - but do the public agree it's a hot look?

To win praise for his fashion is certainly a step forward for Kanye - now Femail are testing whether his clothes will be as popular with the public.

Writer Deni Kirkova, 24, from London, trialled the full flesh-coloured body stocking look, stepping out on a London High Street  to find out what the reaction from onlookers would be.

She paired an American Apparel bralet (£12.50), crop top (£10), leggings (£14) and - of course - a £6 pair of pants, from Marks & Spencer, worn over the top, all in a beige flesh tone, topping off the look with a Kim K style parka jacket from Topshop.

Speaking about her outfit, and whether she thought it worked, Deni said: 'The problem is visible pants. It's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now, and it's a bit of a laugh, but I wouldn't dare go out like this seriously. 

'A nude crop top and leggings, though, could work. You'd have to tone this down a notch to take it from catwalk to High Street.

'I'm quite surprised that people on the street generally liked my outfit to be honest - some fashion know-it-alls praised how bold it was, noting the Kanye influence, and said that the jacket and lipstick went well with the all-nude look. 

'Some though, of course, said that the pants were too much.'

Deni's look was inspired by Adidas Originals x Kanye West Yeezy collection seen in New York on Thursday.

The designer's wife Kim Kardashian, 34, turned up wearing an ensemble from the range. She liked the look so much, she even posted an Instagram photo of herself, adding: 'My look for the Yeezy show!!!!!! Yeezy head to toe!!!!!'

Critics similarly seemed to enjoy Kanye's latest fashion offerings with Vogue saying: 'Kanye West's New collection with Adidas lives up to the hype.'  

He had the fashion bible's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, and top designer Alexander Wang sitting front row.

Everyone from builders to couples and fashionistas to old ladies seemed to like the bold look, much to Deni's surprise

The problem for Deni was visible pants. 'It's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now, but I wouldn't dare go out like this seriously'

A review posted on the fashion magazine's website said: 'Hems were raw and frayed, tops billowy, bottoms either skintight to slide into newly unveiled suede stiletto boots or cinched and ready to be tucked into aforementioned Boosts. 

'There were immaculate flak vests and officer sweaters that looked like they’ve actually taken shrapnel, and everything was said to be unisex... On display, in rigid lines of expressionless youth, it was at the very least satisfyingly instigative for a line of sportswear.' 

Refinery 29  noted that Kanye's collection probably would sell well saying: 'It was a lineup of oversized jackets, sweatshirts, sweaters, and leggings, interspersed with Vanessa Beecroft-esque nude-colored underwear. 

'A camo parka that Kim Kardashian also wore was a highlight, and we thought the oversized backpack was a clever accessory that'll probably make it into a healthy stack of editorials.' 

Kanye claims that he wanted the collection to be made up of 'solutions based clothing,' saying, 'I don't want the clothes to be the life, I want the clothes to help the life.' 

It is also thought that it will have a relatively low price point compared to other designer clothes meaning the pieces can be snapped up by his fans. 

Now that the fully nude spray-on look has won approval from fashion darlings and the man on the street, will you be trying it out?

Deni says maybe a nude crop top and leggings could work - without the pants. You'd have to tone this down a notch
