Morgan Schneiderlin feels Southampton can hang on to second place in the Premier League, and possibly even catch leaders Chelsea.

Ronald Koeman's side have won seven of their last eight league fixtures and are just four points adrift of unbeaten leaders Chelsea in second spot.

'For a few games now there has been a lot of expectation and we responded well,' the 24-year-old told Southampton's official website. 

Southampton can catch Premier League leaders Chelsea, according to midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin

'We are ready to kick on, we know that after Saturday we are going to have another break, the mood is very good but we know it can change very quickly.  

'It is important to us before the international break to have a good result against Leicester so we are able to enjoy our national duties.

'Before whatever break it is important to get a victory, but we want to keep second place and to catch Chelsea.'

Schneiderlin will be looking to pick up his seventh France cap in a friendly against Albania next Friday but is remaining focused on Leicester for the time being.

'They have some good players, they did very well against Manchester United (a 5-3 win),' he added.

Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama have formed a formidable partnership in Southampton's central midfield

'We need to be on our toes to win the game. Deep inside, we know we have something good to do this season, but we know we have to work hard.'

Victor Wanyama is likely to partner Schneiderlin in midfield on Saturday having scored crucial goals in recent weeks and, with a fully-fit squad to choose from, Koeman is pleased to have a welcome selection headache.

'It's always a difficult situation,' he said.

'I was a footballer, I understand that kind of problem because that's difficult for the players, but all of them are acting in a professional way.

'Wanyama has scored two times in 1-0 games. That means a lot. I'm happy about all the midfield players, but sometimes one is a little bit more disappointed as they will not start the game, but that is part of the job.'
