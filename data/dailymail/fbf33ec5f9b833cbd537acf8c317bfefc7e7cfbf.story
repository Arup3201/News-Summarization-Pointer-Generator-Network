Infowars founder Alex Jones has been ridiculed live on British television by host who called him an 'idiot' and 'the worst person [he'd] ever interviewed.'

Jones was on BBC One’s Sunday Politics with The Times columnist David Aaronovitch to discuss the secretive Bilderberg Conference, which has been taking place over the past week in England.

The controversial radio host began outlining some of his more outlandish theories of governments plotting to 'disappear people' when he was abruptly cut off.

As Neil, 64, and Aaronovitch discussed the oft-maligned meeting of the world's most influential and elite power players, Jones, 39, ranted loudly about his conspiracy theories until Neil cut him off by ending the segment.

But not before Neil shared his own feelings.

'You are the worst person I've ever interviewed. David, thank you for being with us. It's gone half past 11. You're watching the Sunday Politics,' he said.

The presenter then added, ‘We have an idiot on the program today' and circled his ear indicating that Jones is crazy.

In the moments leading up to Neil's abrupt send-off, Jones shouted his conspiratorial rallying cry as the bemused Aaronovitch sat by the wayside.

‘Hey listen, I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up,' said Jones, between shouts directing people to his website 'Infowars.com.'

'This isn't a game,' shouted the Texan. 'Our government, the US, is building FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) camps.

‘We have an NDAA (National Defense 
Authorization Act) where they disappear people now. You have this arrest
 for public safety, life in prison. It's basically off with their heads,
 disappear them.

‘Take them away. Infowars.com! Liberty is rising. Liberty is rising. Freedom will not stop. You will not stop freedom. You will not stop the republic. Humanity is awakening. Infowars.com.

‘No, you guys are crazy, thinking that 
the public's too stupid. You're crazy, thinking the public doesn't know.
 You're crazy, thinking the public isn't waking up.’

'You are the worst person I've ever interviewed. We have an idiot on the program today'

Mr Jones also told the program that the creation of the Euro was a 'Nazi German plan' and said Bilderberg, also a Nazi concoction, is 'heavily involved in the EU plan'. He added: ‘We have forced them from cover to admit they’re puppeteers above the major parties.'

Neil later tweeted, 'The moment Alex Jones knew he was no longer on air he stopped.'

Meanwhile, a headline at Infowars.com now reads 'Alex Jones Storms BBC, Confronts Bilderberg Member.'

The Bilderberg Conference is an international group of politicians, business leaders and academics who meet behind closed doors - this year at a luxury country hotel near Watford, Hertfordshire.

Piers Morgan has felt the roar of Alex Jones on live television.

Morgan, 48, brought the radio talk show host onto his CNN show in January to explain why he thought the journalist should be banned from the U.S. for his views on gun control.

The topic had been the focus of Morgan's prime-time shows for a period following the December 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Jones, however, spent nearly all of the time screaming at Morgan at the top of his lungs, calling him a 'redcoat foreigner' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to 'take our guns.'

Morgan later wrote about the confrontation in the Mail On Sunday, saying Mr Jones was 'ranting and raving like a gorilla at the zoo who’s just seen the morning bucket of bananas arrive'.
