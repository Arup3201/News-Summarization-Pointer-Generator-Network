Texas Governor Rick Perry's mug-shot has gone viral after he turned himself in at Travis County Courthouse in Texas

He turned himself in at a Texas courthouse after being indicted on two counts of abuse of power.

But after posing for a smirking mugshot, Texas Governor Rick Perry's police photograph has gone viral, inspiring hundreds of memes.

From starring in his own movie, to gracing the cover of GQ for the annual indicted governors issue, people have been quick to add their own special touches to the smug shot.  

He arrived at the Travis County Courthouse on Tuesday for booking on one felony count of abuse of official capactiy and one count of coercion of a public servant.

The Republican governor formally entered a not guilty plea and said he would 'fight this injustice with every fibre of my being' and prevail.

'I'm here today because I believe in the rule of law. I'm here today because I did the right thing. I'm going to enter this courthouse with my head held high knowing the actions I took were not only lawful and legal but right,' he said.

'This issue is far bigger than me, it's about the rule of law, it's about the constitution which allows not just the governor but every citizen to speak their mind free of political interference or legal intimidation. 

'This indictment is nothing short of an attack on the constitutional powers of the office of governor. There are important fundamental issues at stake and I will not allow this attack on our system of government to stand.'

Perry even made the cover of this spoof GQ for the annual indicted governors issue and was given a pair of comedy glasses in one of the memes after removing his own for the picture

Perry was indicted by a  jury in Austin last Friday over his veto of $7.5million  in funding to a public integrity unit headed by Rosemary Lehmberg, the district attorney for Travis County.

The Texas Governor called for her resignation after she was convicted of drunk-driving in April last year and carried out the veto when she refused to step down. 

Austin Police Department released his mug-shot to the public and people quickly took to twitter to correct the lack of glasses and add their own special touches.

There was even a reference to Robert Burt, the Maine teen who showed up for his booking photo wearing a T-shirt bearing his mug shot from a previous arrest.

Minutes after he was fingerprinted at the courthouse, the Texas Governor  posted a photo from his official Twitter account of him outside Sandy's Hamburgers in down-town Austin.

The photo shows Perry holding an ice cream cone, with his arm around a woman. 

His attorneys, David Botsford and Tony Buzbee, are standing nearby with their own ice cream cones.
