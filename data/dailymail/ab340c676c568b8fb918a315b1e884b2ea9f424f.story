Lord Justice Leveson (above) stressed that the possibility the second part of the inquiry may not go ahead has not affected his approach to the first part

Lord Justice Leveson  yesterday hinted he may ditch the second part of his inquiry into the Press, which was due to look specifically at News of the World phone hacking.

He said waiting for the conclusion of any potential criminal  trials meant it would be ‘very many months, if not longer’ before his inquiry could begin.

He suggested consideration should be given to the value of his investigation, which he said would involve ‘enormous cost’ to the taxpayer and would simply ‘trawl over’ previously heard material.

Although he did not rule out pressing ahead as planned, Lord Justice Leveson said it was ‘in everyone’s interests’ to allow the first part of his inquiry to go ‘as far as it possibly can’ in case the second part is abandoned.

When the Prime Minister announced the inquiry, at the height of the controversy over phone hacking in 2011, he said Lord Justice Leveson should conduct his investigation in two parts.

The first was to examine the ‘culture, practices and ethics’ of the media, including contacts and relationships between the Press, politicians and police, and make recommendations for a new regulatory regime.

Rupert Murdoch at the Leveson Inquiry last week. When David Cameron commissioned the probe in the wake of revelations about phone-hacking at the News of the World in July 2011, he gave Lord Justice Leveson a remit to carry out an inquiry in two parts

The second was to investigate the 
‘extent of unlawful or improper conduct within News International, other
newspaper organisations and, as appropriate, other organisations within
the media’.

Labour MP Chris Bryant, whose phone was hacked, told BBC Radio 4's World At One: 'All I ever wanted... was an inquiry into what went on at the News of the World'

It would also look at allegations of 
corrupt payments to police and allegations that the police failed to 
respond properly to the initial phone hacking allegations.

Last night Chris Hutchings, a lawyer 
acting for some of the hacking victims, said: ‘It would seem very likely
that, in the course of the ongoing criminal proceedings, much of the 
evidence as to unlawful or improper conduct at News International will 
be addressed and findings made. In those circumstances, it would make at
least aspects of any part two redundant.’

The board of News Corporation  last 
night dismissed claims by members of the Commons culture, media and 
sport committee that Rupert Murdoch is ‘not fit’ to run his global media
empire.

Their unanimous vote of confidence 
came as Labour and the Liberal Democrats piled pressure on broadcasting 
regulator Ofcom to speed up a report on whether Mr Murdoch is a ‘fit and
proper person’ to control Sky TV. Ofcom yesterday insisted it would not
be ‘rushed into a knee-jerk reaction’.
