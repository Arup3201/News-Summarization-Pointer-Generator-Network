Raheem Sterling has put contract talks on hold until the summer, Brendan Rodgers has confirmed.

Liverpool have been in negotiations for several months with the 20-year-old and his agent over a deal to replace the old one which expires in 2017.

And the Reds boss confirmed it will not be resolved until after this season's conclusion. 

Liverpool's Raheem Sterling has put his contract talks on hold until the summer, Brendan Rodgers has said

Sterling's current deal runs until 2017, and he had been in negotiations with Liverpool over an extension

'Not between now and the end of the season,' said Rodgers. 'It has been made clear by Raheem's agent. I repeat that this is the best place for his development and it is clear.'

Sterling is set to start as Liverpool face a huge clash with Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday, with a place in the top four of the Premier League at stake. 

'It is an important game,' continued Rodgers. 'I don't think the result will have an overriding factor but it will certainly give you a great boost psychologically if we were to win. We want to win, we want to be competitive. '

Rodgers also confirmed that captain Steven Gerrard, who returned from injury at Swansea on Monday night, will have a big part to play between now and the end of the season, but refused to say whether he would be guaranteed a start or not.

Rodgers also backed Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left), saying he is committed to the team

'It is very simple with me and Steven,' said Rodgers. 'I think it has been really unfair on the boy. 

'When he was out injured, people tried to sensationalise a story about him getting in the team. It might not be the story you want but he is committed to the team. 

But his support to Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen has been fantastic. I see people trying to predict the team but he hasn't been fit. He is going to have a big part to play, and is a wonderful, wonderful player who has so much still to give.

'Even when he doesn't start, he comes off the bench and gives calmness to the team. Playing or not playing, Steven's professionalism is outstanding. He is fit, available and whether he starts or comes off the bench, he will be ready to make a contribution.'
