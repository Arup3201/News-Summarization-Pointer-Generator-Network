London Mayor Boris Johnson said he backed the freedom for people to spend their money however they wished, even if it meant being foolish

If people blow their pensions on luxuries and end up living in a rusted Lamborghini eating dog food that is ‘their look out’, Boris Johnson has claimed.

The London Mayor defended plans to allow people approaching retirement to withdraw all of their pension pot as a lump sum, instead of having to use it to provide steady income for the rest of their lives.

Mr Johnson said the changes to annuities announced in last week’s Budget is ‘all about trusting people to run their own lives’.

Up to 400,000 people will benefit immediately from the coalition's radical pensions shake-up, David Cameron has said.

Under the changes workers nearing retirement will be allowed to withdraw the cash they have built up in private pension pots.

With no need to take out an annuity - paying regular sums for the rest of their life - pensioners will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like.

If follows anger from pensioners about the dismal payouts that annuity providers offer.

Critics claimed the law was needed to stop people squandering their money because they do not realise how long they will live.

Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said last week he was ‘relaxed’ about how people use the money, adding: ‘If people do get a Lamborghini, and end up on the state pension, the state is much less concerned about that, and that is their choice.’

Today he received the backing of Mr Johnson, who said the remarks ‘made me stand on my chair and cheer’.

The Conservative Mayor of London said that when people reach a pensionable age they should be allowed to run their own lives, and ‘not be treated like children’.

‘It may well be that buying a Lamborghini is not always the right move,’ he said in his Daily Telegraph column.

‘There may indeed be some foolish old 
people who end up living in a rusting and motionless Lamborghini and 
eating tins of dog food, because they have gone for the luxury car 
without making adequate provision for the rest of their needs.

‘There might be some pensioners who spent their declining years plying the streets with a Lamborghini minicab.

‘As
 I am sure Steve Webb meant to imply, the Lamborghini option is not 
going to be for everyone – not when the average pension pot is £25,000.

‘But
 the point is that it is their look-out; it is their savings; it is up 
to them to decide what to do with it. It is that sudden rush of freedom –
 the empowerment of millions of people – that naturally appals the 
left.’

People should be free to buy Lamborghini with their pension pot if they want to, says pensions minister Steve Webb

Chancellor George Osborne announced moves to scrap rules that force most pensioners to use their direct contribution funds to buy an annuity, even though the rates can be poor.

Although most of the reforms will apply from April next year, a number will be brought in from Thursday to ensure people close to retirement do not miss out.

Individuals with total pension savings of £30,000 or less will be able to take the full amount as a lump sum, nearly double the current £18,000 limit.

The minimum annual income required to access a pension fund flexibly will also be cut from £20,000 to £12,000, while access rules will be eased so people with substantial pots can draw higher incomes.

But Mr Johnson risked fuelling concerns about a housing market boom by saying ‘huge numbers’ of people would now sink their retirement savings into property.

The coalition argues that hundreds of thousands of people will benefit from the decision to scrap rules that force most pensioners to use their direct contribution funds to buy an annuity, even though the rates can be poor.

Mr Cameron will use an event with meeting Saga members in Brighton today to insist the changes represented core Tory values.

Speaking ahead of his visit, the Prime Minister said: ‘This is about our values. It's about backing those who work hard, save and do the right thing.

‘And it's about saying that the best people to look after their money are those who earned it in the first place.

‘Labour have been all over the place. First they come out with the patronising nonsense that people can't be trusted to spend their own money sensibly. Then they back our plans. Then they're not sure.

‘So the contrast is clear: while Labour dither and flail around for ideas, we have made long-term changes that will give millions greater security in old age.

‘Labour ignored Britain's savers, we are on their side. Labour punished those who work hard and play by the rules, we are on their side.

‘This is an historic change - the biggest revolution in pensions and savings for 100 years - and I'm proud the Conservatives have delivered it.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband made no mention of the pension changes in his Budget speech in the Commons last week, and the party has appeared contradicted about its response.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves insisted the party backed the shake-up in principle.

‘We support reforms to the pension market, so people can get a better deal and have more flexibility, especially at the moment, when people are just not getting a very good deal on their annuity,’ she told Sky News' Murnaghan programme.

She argued that the Government had not ‘gone far enough’ in the Budget, and should also impose a cap on fees and charges by pensions and annuities firms.

But shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna declined to say whether Labour would vote in favour of specific legislation.

And shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said there were ‘some serious concerns underneath the scrutiny’ of the policy.
