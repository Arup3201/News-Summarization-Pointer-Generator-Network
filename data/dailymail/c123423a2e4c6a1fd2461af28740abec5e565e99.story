The ECB agreed their central contract severance deal with Kevin Pietersen on Friday afternoon.

Pietersen's advisers Angus Porter, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association and lawyer Bob Mitchell, from Harbottle & Lewis, negotiated his pay-off.

It's understood the terms include a confidentiality contract that will prevent Pietersen, who was sacked by England this week, from speaking out until his annual ECB deal was due to expire at the end of September.

This will still allow Pietersen the opportunity to cash in on the lucrative Christmas market with a tell-all book about his England career.

It also means he is now a freelance cricketer allowing him to gain the best possible terms in the Indian Premier League auction next week now that he is contractually free to play in the entire tournament.

Pietersen's camp were keen to finalise his central contract exit before the claims by his supporters, led by Piers Morgan, of what went on in Australia started to impact on the confidentiality issue.Â
