A restaurant is going against the trend of stores banning customers from bringing in their guns - by offering a 10% discount to those who do.

Bergeron's Boudin and Cajun Meats in Port Allen, Louisiana, is cutting the price for anyone who comes in with their firearm.

Owner Kevin Cox said the initial idea was to entice police officers who were on duty to come in but he extended the policy when other customers asked for the deal.

Patrons who flock to the store, which specializes in cajun meats and fried catfish, now say they feel safer when sitting down to their favorite meal.

Mr Cox told WAFB: 'If you have a gun on you, I'm going to give you a discount.

He added: 'Everyone is banning guns. Target is banning guns. Everywhere is banning guns, and they need to realize this is where people with guns are going to go. 

'I want to take the opposite approach. How can I make this place safer?' 

The local restaurant has 500 customers in daily and Mr Cox has said he hands out up to 15 discounts a day.

'My friends and relatives would come in with their guns on their holster. I felt good about that. It made me feel safer that they were there with their gun so why not include all good citizens with the officers too,' said Cox.

Customer Steve Moore supports the policy and believes it protects his Second Amendment rights.

He told the station: 'I think it protects the restaurant. It discourages people from breaking in. If they think someone may have a gun and it's concealed, you'll think twice about coming in and robbing somebody.'

Olivia Carambat stopped by for lunch last Thursday with her Smith and Wesson 38.

She said: 'There's so many people who are trying to take our guns away and the government makes stricter gun laws. They forget that we really do, we're given the right in the Constitution to keep and bear arms.'

Louisiana has open gun laws which mean you are free to carry a firearm if you are over the age of 17 and  those around you can see it. No licence is required to purchase a rifle or shotgun.

Customers now say the feel more safe and would 'think twice' about robbing the popular local venue
