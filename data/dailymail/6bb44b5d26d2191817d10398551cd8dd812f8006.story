The twin of one of the children survived 
the blaze that was reported to authorities just before midnight Saturday
 in a two-story brick home in the Far Rockaway section of Queens.

Tragic: Paramedics rushed tiny Jai'Launi Tinglin, 4, and his half-sister Ayina Tinglin, 4, to St. John's Hospital in cardiac arrest, but doctors were unable to save them

Khalid Baylor, spokesman with the Fire 
Department of New York, said the fire was accidental, but he wouldn't 
elaborate on exactly what caused it.

Within minutes of police and firefighters
 arriving, the children were carried outside and rescue workers tried to
 resuscitate them as neighbors watched. The fire was under control less 
than an hour and a half later.

The two 4-year-olds, a boy and a girl, were pronounced dead at St. John's Episcopal Hospital. Police have identified the boy as Jai'Launi Tinglin and the girl as Ayini Tinglin. They shared the same father.

Their 4-year-old sister - Jai'Launi's twin - was hospitalized in stable condition at St. John's.

The children's 63-year-old grandfather and a 55-year-old woman survived the blaze and are in stable condition. The woman's relationship to the others is unclear.

A firefighter who suffered a minor injury was treated and released from a hospital.

Diane Tinglin, 28, stepmom of all three children, could barely hold it together as she described the tragic loss to the New York Post.

'Those were really good kids. All I can I think about now is how he [Jai'Launi] was fine, he was playing in the yard …' said Tinglin, who then broke down into screaming tears.

'Oh my God, I’ve been holding it back all night, trying to be strong! But those kids … '

Firefighters carried the limp bodies of the tots out on their shoulders, witness Calmen Masri, 24, said.

'They took (the kids) out and started doing CPR. One was wearing what looked like a nightgown. You could tell they weren't going to make it. I had to look away,' Masri said to the New York Daily News.

The three children were visiting their grandmother, the dad’s mom, and grandfather when flames broke out.

At St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan offered prayers for the children who died in the fire.

'We hold up to the Lord the needs of those for whom this Easter Sunday morning might still seem like the darkness of Good Friday. We think of that family that lost those two little children in the fire last night here in New York,' Dolan said.

The fire occurred in the seaside community of Far Rockaway, a narrow strip of land hit hard by Superstorm Sandy in October 2012, when fires destroyed dozens of homes as the ocean met the bay.
