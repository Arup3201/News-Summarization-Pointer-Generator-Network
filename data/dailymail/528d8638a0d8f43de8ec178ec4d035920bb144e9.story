A South Korean soldier who went on the run after allegedly killing five colleagues has been captured after shooting himself in hs military officials said today.

A Defence Ministry spokesman said the 22-year-old sergeant, identified only by his surname Yim, shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself.

He said Yim has been taken to a nearby hospital.

A massive manhunt was launched for Yim after authorities said he killed five comrades and injured seven others near the North Korean border on Saturday night before fleeing his frontline army unit with his standard issue K2 assault rifle.

Trick: The ploy was used because the fugitive, who allegedly killed five colleagues and wounded several more before going on the run, needed quick medical treatment, said a Defence Ministry official

Yesterday, he fired on the troops chasing him, injuring a platoon leader.

Today, officials said a South Korean soldier was wounded by suspected friendly fire.

Troops
 had surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost
 and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father.

Yim's parents also used a loudspeaker to try to persuade him to surrender.

It
 was not clear what triggered the rampage and there was no indication 
that North Korea, South Korea's bitter rival, was involved.

Yim
 was due to complete his nearly two years of mandatory military service 
in September, according to defence officials. Initial personality tests 
last April put him within a group of soldiers who needed special 
attention and were unfit for frontline duty, a Defence Ministry official
 said.

But tests last November concluded that he had improved and could 
serve in the frontline area.

The
 rampage comes as South Koreans grapple with worries over public safety 
in the wake of an April ferry disaster that left more than 300 people 
dead or missing.

And some in
 Seoul have raised questions about the discipline and readiness of South
 Korea's military, which is under near-constant threat from a North 
Korea that has recently staged a series of missile and artillery drills,
 traded fire with the South near a disputed maritime border and 
threatened South Korea's leader.

A Defence Ministry spokesman said two of the wounded were in a serious condition, but added that all three were expected to survive (pictured, soldiers from Yim's outpost)

'Due
 to a shortage of troops, even some soldiers on the list of special 
attention had to be on border guard, which requires soldiers to be 
heavily armed.

Needless to say, the military needs to come up with 
remedial measures to this problem,' the Korea Times said in an 
editorial.

Hundreds of 
thousands of troops from the rival Koreas are squared off along the 
world's most heavily armed border.

The Korean Peninsula is still 
technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an 
armistice, not a peace treaty.

Shooting
 rampages against fellow soldiers happen occasionally. South Korea's 
military maintains a conscription system requiring all able-bodied men 
to serve about two years because of the North Korean threat.

In
 2011, a 19-year-old marine corporal went on a shooting rampage at a 
Gwanghwa Island base, just south of the maritime border with North 
Korea.

Military investigators later said that corporal was angry about 
being shunned and slighted and showed signs of mental illness before the
 shooting.

In 2005, a 
soldier threw a hand grenade and opened fire at a front-line army unit 
in a rampage that killed eight colleagues and injured several others.

Pfc Kim Dong-min told investigators he was enraged at superiors who 
verbally abused him.
