Mauricio Pochettino has warned Younes Kaboul that captaincy privileges do not extend to favours when it comes to team selection.

Pochettino chose Kaboul to be Tottenham’s captain ahead of Hugo Lloris at the start of the season after Michael Dawson left for Hull City.

But the France defender has lost his place in the team, with the Spurs boss settling on Jan Vertonghen and Federico Fazio as his central defensive partnership.

Mauricio Pochettino selected Kaboul as his captain at the start of the 2014-15 season      

Pochettino said: 'It’s a football decision, no other explanation. When you decide to pick the starting 11 it’s not because he’s captain or his name is different from another.

'You pick the player because it’s your job and it’s my decision. The captain means that you are a leader but because you are a captain you are not sure of starting 11. I am the head coach and I decide the players for each game.'

Apart from the Europa League tie at Besiktas, when Tottenham were already sure of qualification for the knock-out stages, Kaboul has not started since a 2-1 defeat at home to Stoke in early November.
