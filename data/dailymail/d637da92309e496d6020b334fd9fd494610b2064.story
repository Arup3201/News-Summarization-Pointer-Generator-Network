The Pope has written to the Russian President urging him to tell President Obama and other world leaders at the G20 summit to oppose a strike in Syria.

The letter was the latest in a series of moves by Pope Francis to prevent involvement in Syria's bloody civil war.

He has sent tweets condemning a potential war and declared today a day of fasting and prayer for peace in the war-torn country, according to Time.

Pray for peace: Pope Francis takes part in a vigil after writing to G20 leaders as he calls for a peaceful resolution in Syria

In his letter to Putin and other G20 leaders he wrote: 'I make a heartfelt appeal for them to help find ways to overcome the conflicting positions and to lay aside the futile pursuit of a military solution.'

'Let there be a renewed commitment to seek, with courage and determination, a peaceful solution through dialogue and negotiation of the parties, unanimously supported by the international community.'

The Pope's push for a peaceful resolution was echoed by the Catholic Church in the U.S. as Cardinal Dolan and American bishops wrote to Congressmen calling on them to vote against military intervention. 

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops also wrote to President Obama, saying the Pope had 'made it clear that a military attack will be counterproductive, 
will exacerbate an already deadly situation, and will have unintended 
negative consequences'.

The Pope has also taken to Twitter to push for a peaceful resolution after the Syrian regime was blamed for a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400 people.

He started the week with a tweet on Monday that read: 'War never again! Never again war!', followed by: 'How much suffering, how much devastation, how much pain has the use of arms carried in its wake.'

On Tuesday, he tweeted: 'We want in our society, torn
apart by divisions and conflict, that peace break out!'.

This was followed by: 'With 
utmost firmness I condemn the use of chemical weapons.' 

On Thursday, the 76-year-old's message was: 'With all my strength, I ask each party in the 
conflict not to close themselves in solely on their own interests. 
#prayforpeace.'

He has also set aside Saturday, the birth of Mary, as a day of fasting and pray for peace in Syria. A vigil will be held in St Peter's Square from 7pm to midnight.

Concern for the Christian minority in Syria also led to a meeting between the Vatican's foreign minister and world ambassadors, to discuss the dangers of extremists opposing Assad's regime, according to the Catholic Sun.

The Vatican adheres to just war theory, which means military action must meet a strict set of criteria, including damage by the aggressor being lasting and 'the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated'.

The Pope's view on Syria follows his predecessors' reactions to conflict. Pope Benedict opposed intervention in Libya, Pope John Paul spoke out against the Iraq war and, during the Panama invasion, Manuel Noriega took refuge in the Vatican embassy.
