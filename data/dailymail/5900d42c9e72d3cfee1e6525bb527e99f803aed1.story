It might not have seemed like it at the time, but Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes his side's 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace back in November was the best thing that has happened to them this season.

The November 23 loss at Selhurst Park saw Liverpool drop as low as 12th in the Barclays Premier League, but a spectacular turn in form since has seen Rodgers mark the defeat as the turning point that sparked a top-four charge.

Victory over champions Manchester City on Sunday stretched the Reds' unbeaten run in the league to 11 games and they are now just two points behind Manchester United in the race for Champions League qualification.

Rodgers spoke alongside former Palace boss Neil Warnock on talkSPORT on Monday morning and joked that his opposite number should take some of the credit for Liverpool's hot streak.

Speaking about Warnock, Rodgers said: 'He should (take credit). That was the defining moment, fair play to them, they were excellent on the day.

'I needed to come away from that and look at the team. We were certainly nowhere near the level we had been in the past 18 months. That was turning point.'

Rodgers' tactical switch to 3-4-3 has been lauded as a major contributor to the change in fortunes, but the Northern Irish manager revealed he had already trialled the system earlier in the season - with mixed results.

'I'd looked at it (3-4-3) at the beginning of the season, but thought I needed to change something,' Rodgers said. 'We played it away at Newcastle, and in cup competitions - nobody picked up on it. 

'We played well at Newcastle, Raheem Sterling was in a wide role - it didn’t suit him, I had to go away and make it work for him.

'It’s come together quite well now we've been able to work on it more - they (the players) believe in it. Other people have to work out how to play us.'
