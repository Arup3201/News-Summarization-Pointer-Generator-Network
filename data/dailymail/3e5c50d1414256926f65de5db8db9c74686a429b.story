The family home of a distinguished British commander who ordered the Charge of the Light Brigade has gone up for sale - with a guide price of £1.65million.

The 15-bedroom mansion was given to the family of Lord Raglan in recognition of his military career at some of the greatest battles in history.

In his early career, Lord Raglan served at the side of the Duke of Wellington during the Battle of Waterloo, during which  his arm was amputated and he had to ask for it back to remove his wedding ring.

Lord Raglan went on to be the senior commander of British Forces during the Crimean War - during which he gave the orders for the charge immortalised by Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s poem and its famous line: 'Into the valley of death rode the six hundred.'

The property is currently owned by Lord Raglan's Los Angeles-based descendant and recruitment consultant Henry van Moyland

Lord Raglan was the commander in charge for the ill-fated Charge of the Light Brigade, later made famous by Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem

Lord Raglan was 66 when he died of dysentery the following year - and never saw the huge mansion which was bought for his family by friends and admirers.

An inscription over the porch states: 'This house with 238 acres of land was purchased by 1623 of the friends, admirers and comrades in arms of the late Field Marshal Lord Raglan GCB (Knight Grand Cross) and presented by them to his son and his heirs for ever in a lasting memorial of affectionate regard and respect'.

Lord Raglan - Field Marshal FitzRoy James Henry Somerset - was portrayed by Sir John Gielgud in the 1968 film 'The Charge of the Light Brigade'.

The house, called Cefntilla, is located in the rolling Monmouthshire countryside and has been passed down through the generations.

At its height in 1964, the estate ran to more than 1,000 acres and included six farms after the fourth Lord Raglan expanded on the original 238 acres.

But it has been sold off bit by bit over the years and the unmodernised mansion house and 62 acres of land is being sold after the death of the fifth Lord Raglan, FitzRoy Somerset, in January 2010.

The Grade-II listed property, called Cefntilla, dates back to 1616 but it is believed to require expensive refurbishment work. Pictured is a dining room

The Charge of the Light Brigade on October 25, 1854, was one of the bloodiest battles of the  Crimean War.

On that fateful day, the British light cavalry - led by Lord Cardigan - were sent into a frontal assault on a well armed and prepared Russian artillery.

It's believed there was a problem in the chain of command and Lord Raglan had thought he was sending the 600 men to a completely different, retreating, artillery unit.

Instead the charging cavalry met a ferocious and heavily armed resistance - the brigade was quickly forced to retreat and in the process, suffered huge losses. There were 245 casualties, which included 118 dead.

The charge was immortalised in literature after it was the subject of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem 'The Charge of the Light Brigade'.

The poem reads: 'Half a league, half a league, Half a league onward, All in the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. “Forward, the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!” he said. Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. 

“Forward, the Light Brigade!” Was there a man dismayed? Not though the soldier knew Someone had blundered. Theirs not to make reply, Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die. Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred.

'Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them Volleyed and thundered; Stormed at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of hell Rode the six hundred.

'Flashed all their sabres bare, Flashed as they turned in air Sabring the gunners there, Charging an army, while All the world wondered. Plunged in the battery-smoke Right through the line they broke; Cossack and Russian Reeled from the sabre stroke Shattered and sundered. Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred.

'Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon behind them Volleyed and thundered; Stormed at with shot and shell, While horse and hero fell. They that had fought so well Came through the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth of hell, All that was left of them, Left of six hundred.

'When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made! All the world wondered. Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred!'

The Grade II-listed property is now owned by one of Fitzroy’s nephews, Los Angeles based recruitment consultant Henry van Moyland, who has decided to finally sell off the family’s crown jewel.

Estate agent Knight Frank describe Cefntilla, which dates back to 1616, as one Britain’s finest country mansions - but it will need millions invested in it to bring it up to standard.

A spokesman said: 'It is one of Monmouthshire’s finest houses with beautiful grounds and extensive parkland.

'For the last 150 years has been the seat of the Lord Raglan but the original Jacobean house can be dated by the fireplace in the Great Hall, inscribed "1616".

'It fell into disrepair but was rescued in 1858 by the Raglan Memorial Committee who purchased the house and estate for the widow and descendants of FitzRoy Somerset 1st Lord Raglan, who had died in the Crimean War whilst leading the British expeditionary force.'

The family’s landmark collection of Crimean and Napoleonic War memorabilia was also sold for £2m earlier this year.
