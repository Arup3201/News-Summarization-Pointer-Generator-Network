Scotland's capacity to score goals that somehow manage to be both wondrous and worthless seemingly knows no bounds.

From Archie Gemmill’s majestic solo strike against Holland in Argentina in 1978 to Gordon Strachan’s inch-perfect finish against the Germans in Mexico eight years later, Scotland seem to have cornered the market in tear-stained souvenirs for generations.

When Ikechi Anya raced clear to beat Manuel Neuer and make it 1-1 in Dortmund last month, it briefly looked like the age-old script had been fed to the shredder. Sadly, it proved to be wishful thinking.

Still, in the aftermath of that 2-1 defeat to the newly-crowned world champions, the Watford man rightly basked in his moment of glory. He took to Twitter to proclaim his amazement at putting one past the world’s finest goalie, something he admitted he couldn’t even do on his FIFA computer game.

Endearing though Anya’s reaction was, nothing could dress up a familiar failing for the national team - that far too many of our finest moments down the years have ultimately counted for nothing.

Sitting inside Ibrox on Monday, the kid from Castlemilk reflected on the high watermark of his football career with a rueful smile.

When the subject turned to the need for it not to be merely a flash in the pan, he was typically on the front foot.

‘When you have that feeling you want to work twice as hard to relive it,’ he said. ‘I don’t want to be just the person who scored against Germany. Ultimately we lost the game so it wasn’t even a winner.

‘I’d like to be remembered as one of the team who qualified for 2016. The work ethic stays the same and nothing changes.

‘I don’t think the goal will change me drastically. When you play with higher quality players you will improve. I don’t think the confidence given to me by the gaffer will change. The view that we can achieve anything remains the way this squad feels.’

It’s not hard to see why Strachan has hung his hat on the 26-year-old. Notwithstanding the fact this boy can shift at a fierce rate of knots, he can play and he can finish.

He also possesses an engaging, effervescent personality, and is a beacon of positivity and belief. The type you can’t have too many of.

Such has been his impact for his country over the past year that, despite Watford sitting fourth in the Championship, Strachan feels bigger clubs – Celtic for one – would be a better fit.

‘In football, rumours are spread around all the time,’ Anya straight-batted. ‘Until things are concrete, I don’t think you can speculate.

‘I phoned him (Strachan after his comments) because I just wanted to thank him personally for what he’s said. The game against Germany was a year to the day basically to when I made my debut against Belgium.

‘I thanked him after my first cap and then when I saw the selfless comments I wanted to thank him again. He could play Premier League players ahead of me but he has faith and for that I’m grateful.

‘Having the confidence of a manager of that pedigree is only going to give you confidence. There is no fear when you walk onto the pitch and that is the best thing a player can have. That particularly applies to a player in my position, where you have to make things happen.’

Not a day passes when Anya doesn’ t reflect on his eventful journey to this point – via Castlemilk, Wycombe, Halesowen Town, a string of B teams in Spain then redemption via Glenn Hoddle’s academy that preceded a move to Watford.

‘I used to have to get three buses when I started my apprenticeship at Wycombe and I decided to live at home,’ he recalled.

‘I had to get up at 5.30am and get one bus to Oxford city centre, one to Wycombe and then another to the training ground. I’d always get there early and that’s why now I’m still at the training ground early.’

All those hard miles have been worth it in the long run. As the son of a Nigerian research assistant and a Romanian economist, Anya’s formative years were spent dreaming of one day running out at Ibrox. Come the visit of Georgia next month, he’ll finally have his way.

‘I didn’t go to games as a kid. I didn’t start playing football until I went to England because my dad wanted me to concentrate on my studies first. I used to watch the games on TV, though.

‘I hope my first game at the ground will now be for Scotland. This is the first time I’ve been in the stadium.

‘It is a bit crazy. As a kid, this is the team you support. When I approached the stadium today, I was like: “Wow!”. This is quite a big deal.’

Come October 11, the old place should be pulsating. If Germany away on the opening night was a shot to nothing, the clash with the Georgians offers no room for error. Home games against the flotsam and jetsam of Group D have to serve up no less than three points if qualification is to become a reality.

‘Even against Germany, we went into that with the intention of trying to win it,’ Anya continued.

‘First half we were maybe a little tentative but we put on a good performance in the second - and we’re going to go into these two games (against Georgia and Poland) to win them.

‘I saw an interview with Stevie Naismith a couple of weeks back when he said this Scotland squad has more quality than any other he’s been in.

‘I haven’t been in previous squads but I know when I come here there is such intensity and quality in training. I am always impressed.

‘I can’t compare it to anything else and it is all relatively new to me, but I think we have as good as chance as anyone to qualify.

‘It is part of the progression going on in Scottish football that it will be regarded as failure if we don’t qualify. We need to assume that responsibility and qualify. If we use the performance against Germany as the bar, we’re going to win a lot of games.’
