A tiny Portland home listed for $30,000 has just been sold.

The home, called Skyline, features one bedroom and one bathroom and was designed by Eric Bohne, according to its listing.

Skyline, which the listing says was 'thoughtfully handcrafted from salvaged materials,' also has just 160 square feet of space.Â

The home reportedly features 'a split level living room/sleeping area which can sleep up to 4 adults in two queen size beds or allows for a sleeping area and living room,' the listing says.

Alongside this arrangement is a bar with wooden stools. Near the front door are a series of shelves that can hold small items.

An 'ingenious ladder in the bathroom allows easy access to overhead storage,' and Skyline's 'floor and walls are made of salvaged cedar and fir,' it also says.

The house is currently leased by Caravan - The Tiny House Hotel, the listing notes. Guests at Caravan can stay in a number of different small homes for $125 per night, not including tax.

Earlier this year, married hotel owners Deb Delman and Kol Peterson hosted an open house to view Skyline, Oregonlive.com reported.

'Skyline is our funkiest tiny house and feels and looks very "Portland,"' Delman told the website.

Creature comforts: A small kitchen is also included, which comes with a microwave and minifridge

Well-read: A series of shelves offers space for books, magazine, and even tea

Functional: The 'ingenious ladder' above the toilet leads to a storage space
