Accused fraudster: Craig Siegel is charged with defrauding 19 people in a rental scheme and dumping urine over the head of a building inspector

A Florida man under investigation for fraud was arrested Monday after throwing a bucket of urine at a building code inspector on his property.

The inspector was on Craig Siegel’s Siesta Key property because he built an addition last year without building permits and also was running a scheme defrauding potential renters, authorities said.

Police charged the 44-year-old chiropractor with 19 counts of fraud for his rental scheme. He was also charged with criminal mischief and battery on a code inspector for dousing the worker in urine.

The inspector was on site at 7.20 a.m. to ‘dismantle the modifications,’ according to the Herald-Tribune.

Seigel had other ideas, and dumped the bucket of urine on him to stop the work, police said.

Authorities accuse Seigel of duping people into paying for what they thought was rent on a 12 bedroom mansion when in reality it was a five bedroom McMansion.

Payments totalling about $53,000 were made to a rental company owned by the accused urine thrower.

Victims either accepted their downsized fate or found other accommodations, sources told WWSB. Others demanded their money back.

Seigel insisted they sue him because the money was gone.

(I said) You give me my money back,’ victim Denise Blair recalled to WTVT. ‘He said no, we are not in the financial position to do that.’

But he did have the money to make more than $170,000 in contributions to a retirement account last year, officials said.

He is being held in jail on a $55,000 bond.
