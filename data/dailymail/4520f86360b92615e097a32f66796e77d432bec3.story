Justin Rose knows all about the magic of The Open Championship and the unrivalled buzz generated by the massive audience it reaches through being shown on BBC television.

In 1998, the Englishman went from being a shy, gangly 17-year-old known only among the golfing cognoscenti to the talk of British sport. 

Just a month after Michael Owen slalomed through the Argentina defence to score ‘that’ goal at the World Cup, Rose holed an unforgettable 60-yard pitch shot on the 72nd hole of The Open at Royal Birkdale to eventually finish joint fourth.

It was a stunning performance, and Rose and Owen became linked in the minds of sports fans owing to the fact they were both rarely-gifted teenagers and everyone had been able to watch both events.

Now Rose fears that vital avenue with regard to exposure of golf to a new audience will be cut off if, as expected, live coverage of the game’s most prestigious event is transferred to Sky.

‘I think having golf coverage on free channels is important to the growth of the game,’ he said. ‘You can see it through the massive support Andy Murray receives and that’s largely because Wimbledon is still on the Beeb. It resonates because everyone watches it.’

Rose’s dismay is echoed by Ryder Cup colleague Stephen Gallacher, who believes the decision to hand over all live coverage would have a far-reaching impact on the game.

The down-to-earth Scot is fully aware that most of the UK players who became superstars, like Rory McIlroy, Ian Woosnam, Sir Nick Faldo and Graeme McDowell, came from the sort of working-class households who struggle to afford Sky. 

‘I think the decision is going to have a big impact on British golf in general,’ said Gallacher.

‘It’s a real shame the R&A is making this decision as not everyone can afford satellite television and while the Sky coverage is great, it’s going to be very disappointing for those who wait all year to watch BBC coverage of The Open.’

That theme was taken up by 2012 winner Ernie Els, who admitted he was amazed the R&A could even be thinking of giving The Open to Sky.

‘I am really surprised and can only conclude that Sky must be offering huge bucks for the R&A to be considering it,’ said the big South African, who lives for part of the year in the UK.

‘The BBC may not be so great following the golf ball with their cameras these days but think of all that tradition.

‘It’s going to have a huge impact on golf in Britain. Everyone has got the BBC but not everybody is going to pay to watch Sky. I have quite a few friends who still refuse to pay for Sky. The great thing about the BBC coverage is you can just sit there all day and watch, with nothing but uninterrupted coverage.’

Rose used to do exactly that when growing up. However, he recognises the world has changed and believes the BBC has been letting the sport down in recent years. ‘I think the image of the game has struggled under the BBC and you can see that with their Sports Personality of the Year awards,’ he said. ‘Some of the winning European Ryder Cup teams could and should have been honoured.

‘The fact also that Rory McIlroy didn’t win the major award last year comes down to the fact so little golf is shown on the BBC these days and much more on Sky. It clearly impacted on that decision.’

An announcement on the next television contract is expected within the next fortnight.
