The questions start now, even before Radamel Falcao pulls up a seat at the British consulate in Miami to take the interview necessary for his UK working visa.

Those loose ends need to be tied for the Colombian to earn his wonderful living as a Manchester United player. But then the real examinations start - the test of his reconstructed knee after a terrible injury; the test of his abilities after a season spent between treatment room and the fields of a lesser competition; the test of his commitment within a week of that ‘Hala Madrid’ tweet.

All being well, he will take his significant bag of tricks onto the field for Colombia against Brazil in the Sun Life Stadium in Miami on Friday night.

Porto: 87 games, 72 goals.

Monaco: 22 games, 13 goals.

OVERALL: 200 games, 172 goals. 

United have already seen one expensive signing excel in an international friendly this week, Angel Di Maria taking a stride in answering those who feel this £60m signing was a luxury the club could do without. He was magnificent, his outside-of-the-boot assist for Sergio Aguero in Argentina’s 4-2 win over Germany the work of a rare talent. He had two other assists and a goal on Wednesday.

So, over to Falcao, a man who cost £6m to rent from Monaco for a year, whose salary comes to £280,000 a week. The hope at Old Trafford is that the formalities with his visa will enable a debut against QPR on September 14.

At his best, he is a striker who might just make up for the obvious defensive and midfield deficiencies in the United squad. Conceding three doesn’t matter if you score four, and all that. His record in front of goal is brilliant.

Injury lay-off: Falcao missed the World Cup with a cruciate knee ligament injury

At River Plate – 45 goals in 105 games; at Porto – 72 in 87; at Atletico Madrid - 70 in 91; at Monaco 13 in 22. For Colombia he has 20 goals from 51 games.

They are fantastic numbers, those of a wrecking ball in front of goal. They compensate for his slight lack of a wider contribution – he has assisted only 12 goals for team-mates since moving to Europe in 2009, a period in which he has scored 155 in 200 games. So goals will be the main measure of his success at United.

And to do that, his left knee will need to be strong. For all the excitement about the player United have signed, it must be set against a record of only two starts since he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in January. Will he still have that acceleration, that agility to twist and turn before finishing?

Early days: Falcao made his name at River Plate in Argentina before moving to Europe

It is not an ideal backdrop to his first major role at one of the world’s truly elite clubs, even if United have seen far better days. It goes without saying that his record at Atletico, his only spell in a major league, was all the more remarkable because he lacked the support that Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi enjoy. But with a bigger club comes bigger pressures, not least when Falcao is seen as one of the major players responsible for getting United out of the incredible hole they dug.

And how committed is he to that cause? How frustrated is he that he won’t be part of the Real Madrid side defending their Champions League crown, a competition in which Falcao has not appeared since 2010? Five days ago he tweeted it was a ‘dream come true’ to join Real.

His father, Radamel Garcia, explained: ‘The deal with Real Madrid did not happen because if you have money and you go to the market to buy a shirt or a pair of trousers, you have to decide whether to buy it or not.

Short stay: Falcao spent only one season at Monaco before joining Manchester United this week

‘Real Madrid chose not to. I don’t know, I have the feeling they wanted the player for free with a number of conditions. In any case, they bought the trousers and shirt they wanted and they considered that to be better. We have to accept it.’

It all leaves plenty of questions. Another surrounds the decisions next summer, when Falcao will be 29. It will be interesting to see if United then see worth in a deeper investment, or if their top-four aims have been achieved via this short-term project.

So much will be learned in the coming weeks. If Falcao is over his injury, his Real disappointment and can adapt to the biggest pressure of his career, Manchester United might just have signed the best out-and-out striker in football. And what a coup that would be. He needs his visa first.
