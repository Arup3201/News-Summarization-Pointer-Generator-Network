When a fresh-faced dancer from Sydney's Northern Beaches met a Colombian photographer in Paris, little did she know she was about to be thrown into the world of a European cocaine ring.

Robyn Windshuttle was 21 years old when she travelled to the French capital to dance with world-famous cabaret troupe The Bluebell Girls and later on the Moulin Rouge.

It was her first day in Paris in 1976 when she first caught a glimpse of a Colombian man - only known as Daniel - and the attraction was immediate.

Ms Windshuttle has now penned a book about her 10-year relationship with Daniel, who turned out to be a drug dealer, called 'Dancing with a Cocaine Cowboy'.

When they first met, Daniel told Ms Windshuttle he was a photographer and because he was carrying a Nikon camera at the time, she had no reason to doubt his story otherwise.

But soon the 21-year-old realised her 'glamorous life' of 'flashy cars, fur coats, diamonds and gold' was funded by profits of a Colombian drug syndicate operating in Paris with the help of her new lover.

During her long-term relationship with Daniel, Ms Windshuttle said she had witnessed a number of drug raids. It was Daniel who introduced her to cocaine - but Ms Windshuttle said she was never an addict. 

Two years after meeting Daniel, she gave birth to Danielito (pictured with Ms Windshuttle and her former Colombian lover)

'It's a bit like having a glass of wine at night. You'd do a bit of cocaine at night,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Despite popular opinion, Ms Windshuttle said the cocaine scene was never a 'sleazy' one.

'I don't actually know the full details [of the operation] and he never told me what was going on,' she said. 

'Colombia's gross domestic product was cocaine...and cocaine was a drug for the elite and there was money to be made.

'It's a party drug and people who were high-profile lawyers were the kind of people who did cocaine.' 

Most of the expat dancers rented accommodation close to Le Moulin in impossibly tiny studios 

that cost the earth. There were a couple of sisters from New Zealand, some Australians and lots

of British girls and boys. We’d catch up and chat about our lives and swap the latest gossip in 

between costume changes or waiting in the wings: who was sleeping with whom; who was going

to be axed; what work was in the wind. But I rarely socialised with my dance friends outside of

work because Daniel was the focus of my life. Of an evening he’d zoom me to work in his flashy

BMW then usually meet me after the show for a late supper before we headed off into the night.

There was always a party somewhere and new friends, a trendier club, a fancier restaurant.

Wherever there was cocaine there were the wealthy, the chic, the artistic, the models, and Daniel

was at the centre, vibrant, charming, engaging. Usually it would be close to dawn before we finally

slid into bed, aroused by the charge of cocaine. Our desire for each other was insatiable, our

erotic play steamy, lascivious and sensual. Lustful pleasure and intimacy consumed us. 

 

I savoured the subdued times too; usually when we had outdone ourselves in the night scene

we’d restore our souls with a quiet stroll along the Seine, a movie or a wander up narrow

laneways into obscure book stores, galleries and gardens. The Bee Gees’ new album Saturday

Night Fever was playing in all the nightclubs and we couldn’t get enough of it. ‘How Deep is Your

Love?’ still resonates with me 30-odd years later, as does the Bellamy Brothers’ ‘Let Your Love

Flow’. Occasionally I’ll hear them play and am immediately transported back to the time

when Daniel and I were immersed in a blazing romance. 

Ms Windshuttle said she adapted well to her new lifestyle because she was 'really in love' with Daniel and - growing up on Sydney's Northern Beaches - she was accustomed to the drug scene.

'You would see people smoke drugs and they still do,' she said.

'People were growing pot at the back of high school and growing bushy weeds in greenhouses in Warriewood. 

'So I wasn't frightened of being surrounding people doing drugs. We were hippies smoking dope.

'I was optimistic and I didn't think anything bad was ever going to happen.'

Ms Windshuttle said she still keeps in contact with Daniel despite their relationship ending 30 years ago

Two years after she met Daniel, Ms Windshuttle gave birth to her first child, Danielito, who she says is evidence of the love she shared with the Colombian drug dealer.

But soon the bliss of a child soured as Daniel's infidelity started eating away at their relationship.

'Daniel was a bit of a Lothario. I had doubts about his fidelity,' Ms Windshuttle said.

'His dalliances became unbridled infidelity, and I tried to ignore it for a long time.'

Ms Windshuttle's only other solace - apart from her son - was dancing.

During her decade-long relationship with Daniel, her career as a dancer also took off and took her to Hong Kong, the UK, Amsterdam, Milan, Ibiza and Monte Carlo.

The tall and blonde stunner also did a stint at the world-famous cabaret house, Moulin Rouge, in Paris.

'It was fabulous. There were full houses every night,' Ms Windshuttle said.

'There were feathers and diamantes. It was a very glamorous show and it was one of the most prestigious shows.

'It wasn't until later when I grew up, I realised that I had accomplished a lot and had such success. I was very proud.'

Ms Windshuttle had been a dancer since she was six years old and danced for the Moulin Rouge

Finally the instability of her lifestyle and Daniel's indiscretions led Ms Windshuttle to take back control of her life.

At 28, she and her son moved back to Australia and settled in Mosman, but Daniel soon followed.

'For the next three years, I would visit him in Europe and he continued to provide for us,' she said.

'Then when he was deported from Australia [for drug-related offences] that was the end of the relationship.'

Ms Windshuttle, who is now 59 and lives in Forster on coastal New South Wales, said she still kept in touch with Daniel - in his 70s - who lives in Colombia.

'It's hard not to stay connected. We remain connected in a bizarre way,' she said.

'The ties have never really been cut even though we've lived separate lives for 30 years.'

Dancing with a Cocaine Cowboy is published by Allen & Unwin and is now available online.
