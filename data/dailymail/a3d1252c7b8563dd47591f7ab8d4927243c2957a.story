Mothers invited to a conference on breastfeeding were told by the government it was 'not appropriate' to breastfeed at the event. 

The summit on nursing babies entitled 'Shifting the Curve - Sharing the Challenge' was scheduled to take place at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium next month. 

The Scottish government invited dozens of volunteers and NHS workers to the event. 

But mothers who asked to bring babies to the conference were told by officials the venue 'is not designed to accommodate breastfeeding'. 

Dr Lesley Taylor, pictured with son Tristan, 14 months, said she was 'shocked' by the government's decision

Dr Taylor, with Tristan and Cameron, four, also runs Supporting Public Breastfeeding in Scotland. She said the government was being hypocritical in excluding mothers from breastfeeding at an event promoting it

Elise Stirling, pictured right with her seven-month-old daughter Tabitha, said the decision to exclude mothers from the summit was 'preposterous' 

Mothers were told in an email the conference on breastfeeding was 'not designed to accommodate mothers who are still breastfeeding' 

Elise Stirling, who runs parenting consultancy Bond, Baby!, said she was sent an email by organisers informing her it was 'not appropriate' to breastfeed at the event, after she told them of her dietary requirements because she was breastfeeding.

Ms Stirling, who lives in Falkirk, told MailOnline: 'Their reason for turning us away was very flaky, they made it all about the babies, implying that despite breastfeeding my baby on demand (the very thing they are meant to be encouraging) that I would still be welcome without my baby. 

'I replied that this was still discriminatory (and illegal, if they followed through on it) and the ​next reply I got was a group email to multiple respondents saying that they had updated the arrangements and it was now suitable. 

'The point is, though, that nursing mothers don't need extra facilities, they just need a chair and their baby - the rest is all natural.

'Most people in other lines of work wouldn't take their baby to work with them. Lots of these ladies either work voluntarily while breastfeeding themselves or work from home to spend time with their children. 

'The summit was open to "anyone who works with parents and children" and many of these women struggle to find relevant, affordable cpd to keep their professional learning up to date. To exclude these women was preposterous.

'There was no apology or admittance of guilt provided in the final email, just an assurance that the matter had been resolved.'  

The summit on breastfeeding will take place at Murrayfield Stadium, in Edinburgh, on February 24

Labour MSP Elaine Smith (pictured) said it was 'astonishing that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome at a conference on the very issue' 

Campaigner Dr Lesley Taylor, 31, told MailOnline: 'Everyone was quite shocked. When mothers are breastfeeding they don't need any accommodation, they just want a seat to sit on.  

'But they were told the summit could not "accommodate" breastfeeding. The advert for the event said the Government is trying to break down the barriers to breastfeeding.

'So by excluding mothers from breastfeeding they are being hypocritical.' 

She added: 'The government has now said they are happy to accommodate mums at the event, but I hope they don't set aside a separate area so they cannot attend the session.' 

Dr Taylor added that women who emailed officials to check whether children could come, received a reply saying the event was 'mainly aimed at professionals and service providers' and requesting that 'babies and infants are not brought along'. 

Fellow campaigner Labour MSP Elaine Smith added: 'It's astonishing that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome at a conference on the very issue.' 

The Scottish Government has now backed down and arranged for facilities to be provided for the event following the complaints. 

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'A statement was put on the event website advising attendees that the conference was mainly aimed at professionals and service providers, and that facilities for mothers were limited. 

'However, the number of mothers with babies planning to attend the event was underestimated. Consequently we have already arranged for an extension to the baby changing facilities, and a quiet area for mothers and babies to ensure that all who wish to attend can.'

The event was organised to address the relatively static rates of breastfeeding in Scotland over the last decade. 

Experts will come together to share the latest evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding, review what is working well and identify ways to drive up rates.

A key focus will be on increasing rates of breastfeeding in the most deprived areas in order to help reduce health inequalities.

Mothers planning to attend a summit on breast feeding were told it was 'not appropriate' to do so at the event

The conference also comes in the wake of strong political debates on the subject in recent months. 

The exclusive Claridge's hotel was widely criticised last month when a woman was asked to cover herself with a 'ridiculous shroud' while breastfeeding her three-month-old daughter.

Louise Burns said she burst into tears when staff members at the five-star venue asked her to cover herself and her baby with an oversized napkin in order to avoid 'causing offence' to other guests.

Also last month, Ukip leader Nigel Farage said breastfeeding mothers should 'sit in the corner' rather than feed their babies in an 'ostentatious' way, while London Mayor Boris Johnson said breastfeeding mothers 'can do it in a sort of discreet way.'
