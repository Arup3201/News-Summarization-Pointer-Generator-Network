After various meetings between Chelsea’s directors, plus frantic telephone calls to owner Roman Abramovich, the club wisely went with the main man.

Jose Mourinho is the most powerful and convincing voice at Chelsea, perhaps the only person who can get through to those who racially abused the Parisian commuter, Souleymane S.

‘I’m not the right person so many politicians, so many people directly involved in something that is difficult for society,’ he pleaded. And yet, deep down, there was no other person to take care of this in public.

The reality about Mourinho’s sombre appearance at their Cobham training centre on Friday afternoon is that, for once, it was not an act.

His dismay and disappointment, at the moment he referred to ‘the humiliation’ of the black commuter, was evident. At times he paused for reflection, struggling to articulate his feelings on this subject.

Mourinho said: ‘We feel ashamed, but maybe we shouldn’t. I refuse to be connected with these people. I support the idea of the gentleman coming to the match, even though I don’t know whether (he) loves football.'

Chelsea have written to Souleymane, inviting him and his family to the second leg at Stamford Bridge.

Souleymane, in an interview given to BBC Radio 5 Live, argued that Chelsea hold a degree of liability.

‘Chelsea are partly responsible and I have brought a complaint,’ he said. ‘Chelsea need to call my lawyers and they haven’t done that yet, unlike PSG. I haven’t had any reply from Chelsea. Nothing.’

A club spokesman on behalf of Abramovich added: ‘We were appalled. The club would also like to apologise unreservedly to Souleymane for the behaviour of a small number of individuals and their unforgivable actions towards him.’ 

‘I’m not saying there’s no racism in football,’ Mourinho added. ‘But it’s society, it’s underground, it’s public transport, maybe this is not football. Maybe the people with the Chelsea scarf, or the Chelsea flag, maybe they don’t even like football or don’t like Chelsea. 

'I feel ashamed to be connected to this sad episode. My feeling is the feeling of everyone at the club. We are very sorry. We want to fight it. We feel ashamed and we want to apologise to the gentleman.

‘Even if he doesn’t like football, put him in the director’s box, people will give him a reaction and he will realise that Chelsea is completely the opposite of what happened.

‘I’m sure he will get a fantastic reaction, in a way where the fans can express how sad they were about it.’

The Chelsea manager had only watched footage of the despicable incident once, turning on the television at his home in the early hours of Wednesday morning after he was alerted by the club’s head of communications. 

The players felt it too, with most of the conversations on the plane home after their 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain revolving around the incident on the metro.

‘The players had the same reaction as we had,’ Mourinho said. ‘I am sure this dressing room is always a dressing room with big principles of equality. We had everything, not just race but also religion.’

To Chelsea’s credit they have acted with speed and courage to identify five individuals already — three on Thursday and two more yesterday — and suspend them from Stamford Bridge while police in Paris and London continue with their investigations. On Friday night the Metropolitan Police released three images of Chelsea fans they wish to speak to in relation to the incident.

Chelsea fan Caroline Rice has started a campaign entitled 'An invitation to Souleymane' in a bid to show the Paris resident he will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge.

Rice is attempting to raise £2,000 in order to invite Souleymane, his wife and children to London for a weekend.

The campaign had already raised £347 by Friday afternoon.

Pressed on the appropriate punishment, if Chelsea or the authorities are capable of proving a case against anyone singing ‘we’re racist, we’re racist, we’re racist, and that’s the way we like it,’ Mourinho’s solution was final.

‘Everybody has to know that the club is ready to finish it,’ he said. ‘No more Stamford Bridge for them. Unfortunately this will not be the last episode — emphatically.’

It was depressing to hear Chelsea’s manager utter those words, but deep down we know it is true.

‘I imagine myself in that same situation, I want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport. It is difficult to believe this can happen in modern times.’

As Mourinho made his way through this minefield, he was also asked to distinguish this incident with the FA’s proven case of racial abuse directed at Anton Ferdinand by Chelsea’s captain John Terry.

Chelsea’s manager had been expecting it and there was an admission, perhaps for the first time by the club, that some inappropriate comments had been made. He insisted, though, that Terry is not a racist.

He added: ‘The only thing I know is 100 per cent, John is not a racist.

‘He had a bad episode, I don’t know, maybe. But I assure you, and you ask every player who has shared the dressing room with John, they would tell you he is not a racist.’

Sadly, he can’t say the same about a section of Chelsea supporters.
