A multi-million pound penthouse flat near London's Regent's Park is at the centre of an acrimonious legal battle between a wealthy sheikh and the wife he married and divorced twice. 

The High Court in London heard that Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khojah, 89, was 'outraged' when his ex-wife and mother of his two children, Melina Abuchian, 63, laid claim to the £20million flat in north London.  

The story of the ex-couple’s extraordinary life together emerged when a judge revealed that they had married in 1979, had two children, as well as homes in Jedda, London, Paris and Cannes, divorced, remarried - and were now divorced again.

The 89-year-old sheikh and his 63-year-old wife are fighting over a flat in this block in Regents Park, London

The sheikh divorced Mrs Abuchian for a second time in an Islamic Talaq ceremony in May this year, the court heard, but the 63-year-old said she had now made her home in London and needed somewhere to live. 

Senior family judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Abuchian claimed to have moved permanently to London in September last year as her marriage collapsed.

But her ex-husband, a successful property developer, disputes that the penthouse is really her home and has been trying to get his ex-wife out of the flat since March.

Mrs Abuchian, however, has responded by winning a temporary injunction against him and his off-shore company, which owns the flat, preventing them from selling it from under her.

The court was told that Sheikh Abdul was 'outraged' that she had resorted to the English courts, insisting that their divorce was a 'deeply, deeply' Saudi Arabian affair.

Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Abuchian can continue her legal battle for the flat in the English courts

He bought the flat in the 1970s, it was revealed, but was now 'very anxious to get on and sell the property' for fear of the hyper-inflated central London property market collapsing.

He asked Mr Justice Mostyn to block his ex-wife’s campaign, disputing the amount of time they had spent at the flat during their married life.

However, Mrs Abuchian insisted that, although she liked her 'beautiful home' in Cannes, she now 'intended to live in London for the rest of my life'.

She said she had made her 'permanent base' in Regents Park and she 'simply wished to live out the rest of my life in a safe and familiar environment'.

In May, she had obtained an 'investor's visa', entitling her to stay in Britain for a five-year renewable period, the court was told.

Mr Justice Mostyn said that, although the flat was formally owned by a Dutch Antilles company, Sheikh Abdul had stated it was really his.

The judge ruled that Sheikh Abdul had 'come nowhere near' to landing 'a knock-out blow' to his ex-wife's case.

His decision means that Mrs Abuchian can continue her fight in the English courts to keep the flat and for other financial provision from her ex-husband's fortune.
