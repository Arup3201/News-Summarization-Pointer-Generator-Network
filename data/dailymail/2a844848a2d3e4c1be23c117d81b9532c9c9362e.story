A mall Santa and his elf have been fired after they turned away a seven-year-old girl with autism because she was there with her service dog, Pup-Cake.

Abcde Santos, whose name is pronounced 'Ab-Suh-Dee', her family and the dog waited in line for 30 minutes to see Santa at The Shops in Mission Viejo, California on Sunday.

But as she neared St Nick, he turned her away.

'To her dismay, Santa was afraid of her service dog,' family friend Julie Miller wrote in a statement on the dog's Facebook page.

Turned away: Abcde Santos and Pup-Cake (pictured at Halloween) were turned away by Santa, who was scared of the dog, her family said. After they explained he was a service dog, he claimed he had allergies

Miller explained that they believe Pup-Cake, who is a pit bull, was turned away because of 'what we can only assume is the influence of BSL (breed specific legislation)'.

'Those dogs eat people,' the Santa said, according to the family. 

The family offered to remove Pup-Cake from the building so that Abcde could speak to him or even wave at him from afar, but Santa refused.

They explained that Pup-Cake was a trained service dog and was lawfully allowed to be there. 

Santa then claimed that he had allergies and turned them away, Miller explained on the Facebook page.

Best friends: As her service dog, Pup-Cake recognizes when Abcde is becoming distressed

Together: Pup-Cake joined the family in 2009 and they have seen a marked difference in Abcde since

'For an autistic child to wait in line for 30 minutes, that's an accomplishment in itself,' Miller said. 

'Santa still refused to see the child; sending her away heartbroken leaving a family to comfort a child instead of celebrating her accomplishments.'

She added that Pup-Cake is a small pit bull who has received Canine Good Citizen training as well as socialization, obedience and public access training.

The Santa, whose real name is unknown, and his elf were hired by the mall through an outside agency, The Noerr Programs.

Following uproar online, the mall said they would be replacing the Santa 'with one that is more compassionate to our guests' needs.' They were fired on Monday.

'We look forward to welcoming back the Santos family and Pup-Cake for a special Santa experience,' the mall added.

The family, who are declining interviews, wants people to know about the Americans with Disabilities Act, which bans discrimination against people with service dogs, Miller told the OC Register.

'They want people to get educated not about autism or pit bulls, but about the disabilities act so that little girls like Abcde won't go and see Santa and end up crying,' Miller said.
