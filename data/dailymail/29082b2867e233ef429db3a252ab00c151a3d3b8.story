The deadly Ebola virus could be used by terrorists to create a dirty bomb capable of killing large numbers of people in the UK, a Cambridge University disease expert has warned.

As fears grow over the spread of the disease across parts of West Africa, biological anthropologist Dr Peter Walsh said that although the risk of it reaching the UK was small, a group such as Al Qaeda could use the virus to create a weapon.

There is currently no vaccine and no cure for Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of its victims.

Although there have been calls for the introduction of fever-screening cameras at UK airports in the wake of the current outbreak, Dr Walsh told a newspaper that should an infected air passenger unwittingly bring Ebola to Britain, medical experts would be able to stop the virus spreading further.

'A bigger and more serious risk is that a group manages to harness the virus as a power, then explodes it as a bomb in a highly populated public area,' Dr Walsh told The Sun on Sunday.

'It could cause a large number of horrific deaths.

'Only a handful of labs worldwide have the Ebola virus and they are extremely well-protected. So the risk is that a terrorist group seeks to obtain the virus out in West Africa.'

The current outbreak of Ebola has already claimed 729 deaths from 1329 confirmed cases in the West African 
countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia. The fatality rate in the current epidemic is about 60 per cent.

The outbreak is unusual for West Africa as the disease is typically found in the center and east of the continent.

Early symptoms of an Ebola 
infection include fever, headache, muscle aches and sore throat, while in the later stages of the disease victims begin bleeding both 
internally and externally, often through the nose and ears, and suffer organ failure.

Among those infected are American doctor Dr Kent Brantly, 33, 
who contracted the virus while in Liberia. He has been brought back to 
the U.S. for treatment in a special isolation ward, and was today said 
to be improving.

However, 
the top U.S. health official Dr Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, has said it was still too soon 
to predict whether he would survive.

A
 second U.S. aid worker who contracted Ebola while working in the same 
facility as Brantly, 59-year-old missionary Nancy Writebol, will be 
brought to the United States on a later flight as the medical aircraft 
is equipped to carry only one patient at a time.

The virus is not airborne and is transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

However, WHO director-general Margaret Chan has warned the virus is currently moving faster than efforts to control it.

She said: ‘This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives, severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries.’

Speaking at a meeting in Guinea’s capital Conakry, she told the presidents of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast that the virus could be stopped, but warned that some cultural practices such as traditional burials were helping it to spread.

Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline, said today it had halted flights to Guinea because of concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus.

Treatment: Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where American Ebola victim Dr Kent Brantly is being treated

Responding: Reporters gather at the entrance to the hospital after an ambulance transporting Dr Brantly arrives. He was said to be responding well to treatment, although experts say it is too early to tell if he will survive

The Dubai-based carrier said flights to the Guinean capital of Conakry were suspended beginning Saturday until further notice.

The airline will continue flying to the West African nation of Senegal, which borders Guinea, saying it 'will be guided by the updates from international health authorities'.

The Foreign Office refused to confirm if British citizens who contract the virus abroad would be flown back for treatment, saying only: ‘Procedures are in place but we are not going to speculate on what we would do in any individual case.’

Labour MP and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee has urged ministers to consider introducing fever-screening cameras at UK airports as up to 10,000 passengers arrive in the UK every week on 30 direct flights from West Africa.

South Africa, which has fewer direct flights from the region than the UK, introduced infra-red thermal imaging cameras at two major airports in April, in an early response to the ebola threat, while Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana, and Nigeria have pledged to introduce temperature screening at airports.

However critics say the cameras can give ‘false positives’ – including people with minor illnesses and those who are hot after a dash through the airport.

Mr Vaz said: ‘As far as I’m concerned any measures – including additional screening – which are felt necessary to reassure the public should be taken.

‘Prevention is always better than cure: We don’t want to have our first taste of ebola before taking action.’
