Angry residents this week accused TV producers of inciting racial hatred as they met to discuss filming of a documentary on immigration in their road.

Residents of the Derby Road area in Southampton came face to face with the Love Productions crew and vented their anger about the show called Immigration Street.

The programme is billed as a follow on from Channel 4's controversial Benefits Street which aired earlier this year and sparked a nationwide debate about welfare in Britain.

Last night, furious residents with banners and placards heckled creative director Kieran Smith, telling him: 'We don't want you here'. 

The creators of the controversial show Benefits Street are currently filming a follow up series called Immigration Street in Southampton, which has angered locals who say it is placing a 'stigma' on the community

The show has provoked a furious backlash from locals - who last night called for the show to be cancelled

Residents then accused Mr Smith and the production company of ‘inciting racism’ by calling the programme Immigration Street.

He failed to win over the public at the tempestuous meeting, held at Maytree Primary School on the street, and was interrupted regularly.

From the outset, audience members turned up with banners reading ‘Go Away Love Productions, We Don’t Want You Filming Here’.

One furious resident said: 'Do you realise the stigma that you are bringing on a community? For you it’s a six-to-eight-week project - for us it will go on for a generation. Do you appreciate that?'

Filming has been taking place over the last few months, with the production company saying the show will ‘reflect the honest experiences of people who have settled in the UK and [have] come to consider it as home’.

Local Kate Gladders said she saw people being filmed outside the centre and one of them had ‘quite distinctive National Front markings’.

More than 200 locals attended the meeting last night and TV show producers were routinely heckled and booed

She said: 'I personally think you chose that particular person because you wanted to incite some racial disharmony in the community.'

But Mr Smith responded: 'We are not cherry-picking vulnerable individuals and we are not here to cause racial tension.'

Derby Road was picked by Love Productions to be the focus of the programme, which is due to be aired on Channel 4 next year.

Kieran Smith, creative director for Love Productions, told the audience the show's name conveyed the message it was an area 'transformed' by immigration over several decades

Mr Smith said the name, which is still a working title, conveyed the message that the street had been ‘transformed’ by immigration over several generations.

Any resident who was filmed would have a chance to see the footage before it was used, and he denied residents were offered cash to take part.

Several times, he was asked what it would take for the company to decide not to continue filming the programme.

But Mr Smith said he was not in a position to cancel the programme or make changes as it would be a joint decision between Love Productions and Channel 4.

He said: 'What we wanted to do with this series is find a street and we found Derby Road in an area which over the years has been transformed by immigration.

'What we’re not doing is saying that everyone who lives in it is an immigrant.

'What we wanted to do was to observe and reflect who lives in one street.'

Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead was one of the politicians who had urged Love Productions to stay away when the plans were first announced.

He addressed the meeting, organised by Newtown Residents’ Association, and urged Love Productions to think again.

Speaking afterwards, he said: 'I think the meeting showed that this company has picked the wrong community.

'Residents have said they want nothing to do with this and they really ought to listen to that.'

Two senior Labour city councillors - Jacqui Rayment and Satvir Kaur - also addressed Mr Smith at the meeting and urged him to listen to the residents.

Before the meeting, residents living on Derby Road and the surrounding community said the show would evoke national emotions.

Skip Bawa, 58, a social worker from Northam Road, said: 'This is a multicultural community that has a lot of culture, passion and harmony.

'This would evoke all sorts of emotions nationally and bring up the old chestnut of immigrants coming to our country and taking our jobs and houses.'

Dil Bhakar, 34, a marketing consultant from Derby Road, added: “I think it’s really disgusting. It’s not a true representation of what the local community is about and it is just a commercial move to get more viewers. It should be stopped.'

Mr Smith told MailOnline he was invited to the meeting but there had been a gathering before that and he felt 'people had been a bit whipped up to not really listen'.

He also completely rejected claims the show was inciting racial disharmony.

Immigration Street is not the first Love Productions show to attract controversy.

Its predecessor Benefits Street was a five part series first aired in January 2014 which provoked hundreds of complaints to police, broadcast watchdog Ofcom, and Channel 4.

Among them were claims it portrayed criminal activities, foul language and misleading portrayals of those on benefits.

Some critics labelled it ‘poverty porn’ and said it painted a false picture of life in modern Britain.

Those starring in the series, including single mother White Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly), were also subjected to death threats by Twitter trolls.

The show even attracted fierce political debate and was the subject of the Prime Minister's Questions in early January.

Channel 4 was criticised for demonising those living on the breadline, while some of the residents claim they were misled into appearing.

'I genuinely don't understand that. One, why would we even want to do that, and two, how would we ever be allowed to do that?

'There are places in the country that if that was our intention we could have filmed a neighbourhood a lot less harmonious, a lot less cohesive.

'It just seemed that a lot of people weren't prepared to listen to that so really our hope is that people will start to listen.'

He said production for the TV show will continue.

He added: 'My hope that the misinformation that is out there can be corrected and that was the hope of the meeting last night. That we can try again.'

Channel 4 is screening the show sometime next year and a spokesperson said claims of racism were 'pure fiction'.

'We understand immigration is a much debated issue which is why Channel 4, as a public service broadcaster has a duty to explore it and not shy away from difficult subject such as this.

'Anyone who does not want to be in the series won’t be but we intend to continue to film with residents who are very happy to share their experience of living on Derby Road.'
