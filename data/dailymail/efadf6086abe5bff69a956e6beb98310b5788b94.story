This is the moment a brave Indian woman confronted a fellow passenger who she claims molested her during a flight from Mumbai.

The woman lambasted the man on camera in front of the entire flight after he allegedly touched her inappropriately through the seat gap on the Indigo flight in January.

The alleged victim later filmed a second clip at Bhubaneshwar airport, in which she shames the man into making an apology.

As he looks in the camera, a man who appears to be the same person says: 'I made a mistake'.

According to a message posted alongside the footage, the incident unfolded after the man allegedly touched the anonymous passenger during the flight.

Although the woman did not react the first time, she decided to confront the man on camera after he allegedly prepared to touch her for the second time, according to the post.

In the video, the furious woman zooms in on the man as he tries to shield his face from the camera.

She then shouts: 'You are asking for forgiveness? Why? Because I'm a girl and you have the right to touch me anytime, anywhere you want to?'

She then adds: 'What forgiveness are you asking for? Did you do it only once? Was it by mistake?

'I will call the security. I will make a complaint. You thought you could do it again right?'

In the second video, the man is filmed in what appears to be the airport, as he is quizzed by the alleged victim and another man.

In the video, he says: 'I'm prepared to face any consequence for it.'

He then adds: 'I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I made a mistake, madam, I made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes in life. I made a mistake. It's a big mistake.'

He also pleads with the woman to stop filming, saying: 'I've got the punishment already. I've got the punishment already... I already faced the humiliation.'

In the video, he says: 'I'm prepared to face any consequence for it,' before adding: 'I made a mistake. I made a mistake, madam' 

But the girl continues to ask the alleged harasser questions, before saying: 'You decided the action; I will decide the reaction.'

The woman also suggests that the man has offered to give her a written apology over the alleged incident.

He then says: 'For touching you, I want to give you a written— I request you.' 

The clip was posted by Shreyas Rao, who says the video had been forwarded to him by the 'brave girl' who allegedly suffered the attack. 

He captions the clip with a statement from the girl, which says: 'This man on the seat behind mine, put his fingers in the seat gap to touch me!

'I was very shocked for sometime to react. By then the flight went to landing mode. Then the moment flight touched down, I got up. Saw his hand was again on the side ready to take up any opportunity to touch me!!!

'I created such a scene, humiliated him in front of the whole flight! He thought like usual girls will keep quiet and he can get away with this! I have lodged an FIR now!'

The statement goes on: 'He is a very rich man of Bhubaneswar and is now very humiliated in front of the people who know him.

'Cant believe the ordeal i had to go thru but being silent is a crime! The police officer was very helpful and the Indigo staff remained with me throughout. The man is under police custody currently.

'I clicked his pictures and made videos, shouted so loud that the entire plane came forward to see him! i made sure i humiliate him as much as possible because i know law will do nothing' 

The alleged incident took board an Indigo flight from Mumbai to Bhubaneshwar. 

According to the alleged victim, the man was arrested and remains in custody. That could not be independently verified by MailOnline.  

A spokesman for Indigo said: 'An unruly behavior was reported on IndiGo flight 6E 553 enroute from Bombay to Bhubaneswar on January 27, 2015.

'During the flight a lady passenger complained of misbehavior from a co-passenger sitting behind her. Our IndiGo crew on board immediately alerted the Captain in command who further alerted the CISF staff and consequently the FIR was lodged in a local police station in Bhubaneswar.

'IndiGo is cooperating with the investigating agencies.'

She added: 'Customer satisfaction is core to our business, and we are sensitive to such untoward incidents onboard.

'We regret the inconvenience caused to the passengers, and hope to serve them once again on-board IndiGo.'
