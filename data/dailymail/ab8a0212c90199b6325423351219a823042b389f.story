If you asked most people, they'd say this is completely nuts.

But a husband and wife team in south-east India make a living out of being one of the country's most impressive stunt acts with a daredevil routine based mostly around slicing coconuts.

Bhramaramba Budati lets her husband smash and slice them on her body when she performs in villages across her native Andhra Pradesh region.

Here, the 39-year-old housewife and mother-of-two are pictured in Prakashan showing off her acts of strength.

They include smashing tiles, tube lights and blocks of ice across her body alongside husband Balashankar Budati, 40.
