A California man gunned down his wife and her two children in their home on Monday night before turning the gun on himself, police believe.

Neighbors reported hearing the Fontana, California family arguing before the violence broke out.

The mother's oldest son, 16, went to the house to check on the family after he had failed to hear from them and found them dead, authorities said.

He discovered his mother and siblings, a 10-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl from a previous marriage, riddled with bullets. It was not clear how long they had been out of contact with the teen.

The stepfather, said to be in his late 
30s or early 40s, was found dead with a single gunshot wound to the 
head. Police believe he killed himself.

A handgun was found and no suspect was being sought, police spokeswoman Martha Guzman-Hurtado said.

'Everything that has been confirmed so far indicates it could be a murder-suicide but that has not been confirmed,' Guzman-Hurtado said.

'They are questioning other people before making that conclusion.'

Neighbors told the KNBC-TV that they heard screaming and gunshots about 10pm following an argument in the house.

It appeared all four lived in the home, Sgt Imhof said. The victims appeared to be a family but identifications by the coroner are pending.

Neighbors in the quiet California neighborhood were shocked by the murders. Many said their children played with the boy and girl who were murdered

Detectives found the bodies and blood spread throughout the house but had stopped the investigation while they sought a search warrant.

'There is some amounts of blood in 
different areas of the house,' Fontana police sergeant Doug Imhof told reporters.

Jonathan Garcia, 22, lives across the street and was watching television at about 8.30pm when he heard yelling, he told the Associated Press.

'I hear "get down, get down!" I recognize that as a cop's voice,' he said.

Garcia said he looked through the window and saw police in SWAT gear with submachine guns.

'So I come outside. They're all rushing at the house. There's a younger kid, probably 16 years old. He's screaming and yelling ... he's saying "that's my mom! That's my mom!"'

Police handcuffed the frantic teen as he called for help, Garcia said, adding: 'They were still trying to figure out what happened.'

Garcia said a woman outside the house was crying and kept screaming in Spanish: 'They're all dead, they're all dead. He killed them all!'

Garcia said the family had lived in the home about three years.

'They were friendly. My dad talked to him (the husband) every now and then,' Garcia said.

Guzman-Hurtado said the last time police visited the home was in June 2010 for an unspecified code-enforcement matter.

'It's a sad day in Fontana,' Guzman-Hurtado said. 'This is one of those days where we're all supposed to be celebrating with family, making new memories with family as we say goodbye to 2013 and welcome the New Year. It's not a day to be mourning lives lost.'

The home is in Fontana, a city of about 200,000 people in San Bernardino County about 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
