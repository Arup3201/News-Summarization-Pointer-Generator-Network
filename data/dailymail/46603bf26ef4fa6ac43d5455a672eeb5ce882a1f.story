Two men have been found dead in the Hudson River after one either fell or jumped into the river and the second jumped in after him.

Police have identified the two men as Elias Serrano and Edwin Cruz who are both from Newark, which is about 10 miles from the area where they were found.

They were with a group of friends near the Eighth Street pier before police were called to the scene at 5.35am on Sunday.

Searching for clues: Police and scuba crews from New York and New Jersey responded to a 5.30am call on Sunday morning and their bodies were found after a 90 minute search

One friend said that he had realized Serrano, 20, was in the water and moments later Cruz, 24, jumped in after him.

The friend, Angel Duran, would not tell NJ.com if Serrano purposefully jumped in the water.

The father of another friend said how Cruz had just spoken with him shortly before the incident.

'At 4:30 a.m. I spoke with Edwin and he told me he was looking after my son,' Peter Baez said.

'Thirty minutes later I got a call from my son, who was shaken and scared. He told me something had happened.

'I've known them for over 20 years. I used to live in Newark. This is a terrible tragedy. They were both starting out.'

Skeptical: One of the victim's brothers did not believe that his brother would have purposefully jumped in the water

NBC New York reports that the NYPD scuba unit spent 90 minutes in the water before finding the bodies at 7.55am and 8.10am.

Hoboken police said that the incident is still underway but have ruled out foul play, according to NJ.com.

The cause of death for both Cruz and Serrano is said to be drowning but the reason why they were in the water in the first place has yet to be determined.

'I question what the police are telling me,' Serrano's brother Ricardo Morales said.

'Something must've happened. My brother was a good kid. He was studying to be an electrical technician and worked at warehouse,' he told NJ.com.

Morales was one of Serrano's nine siblings who were at the police department when next of his death was confirmed.

Their mother collapsed in grief and had to be rushed to a local hospital to be treated with oxygen.
