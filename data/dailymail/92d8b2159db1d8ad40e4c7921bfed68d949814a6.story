A 69-year-old has been struck down by a crippling infection that lay dormant in his body for 20 years.

Ray Squire lost six stone while suffering from discitis – an infection he picked up while swimming off Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in 1992.

Tropical medicine experts believe that he probably picked up the bug, which left him unable to walk for weeks, as a result of swallowing sea water.

However, it was only two decades later that it struck, suddenly leaving him in agony and unable to walk.

Mr Squire, of Pentre Maelor, Wrexham, North Wales, was in hospital for seven weeks while he fought the infection.

One year on, he is still on morphine for the pain.

He said: ‘The past year has been absolutely horrendous. There were times when I didn't think I was going to make it.

‘When you're in unbelievable pain for 24 hours a day it just wears you down.’

In 1992 Mr Squire and his 67-year-old wife Iris, spent six weeks travelling around Australia.

He spent seven weeks in hospital and, a year later, he still requires morphine for the pain in his back

When he returned he was fit and well.

However, last April, when the couple were holidaying in Devon he started to feel unwell.

The former truck driver said: ‘By the time we'd arrived on the coach I was in terrific pain, and by the time we'd got home I couldn't move from my bed.’

Discistis is an infection in the disc space of the spine, which can lead to the disc eroding and being permanently damaged.

Symptoms include severe back pain and a mild fever.

It may resolve on its own if untreated, or it may progress to a chronic infection or even cause an abscess to form.

The cause of discitis is still unclear - it can be triggered by post-operative complications or from a separate infection, such as a urinary infection or a unknown bug, as in Mr Squire's case.

Treatment usually involves antibiotics, and a back brace or plaster cast.

When he got home, Mr Squire underwent
 a scan at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, the results of which were sent to 
the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine for an expert opinion.

Doctors
 then broke the news that he was suffering from discitis - an infection 
in the disc space in his spine - and he was admitted to the Orthopaedic 
Hospital in Gobowen, Shropshire, to be treated with intravenous 
antibiotics.

The main symptom of the condition is severe back pain which can lead to loss of mobility.

It is treated with antibiotics.

He said: ‘Doctors told me I may have picked up a bug up in the Tropics, but it's still a mystery as to how - most probably I swallowed something.

‘We had an apartment in Cairns and I chose to go swimming in the Barrier Reef, but Iris never did.

‘The doctors said it can lie dormant for years, and I never even knew.

‘My doctor said he has been practicing for 28 years and had never come across the condition before.

‘Eventually I went home but still I couldn't even wash or dress myself.’

It is believed that Mr Squire got the infection from sea water while holidaying with his wife, Iris, in Australia

Mr Squire is now on the mend, but says the healing process will take at least another year.

He said: ‘I'm more or less back to normal now, but I still have to take morphine for the pain.

‘I can drive my car now, but walking is still very difficult.

‘I've just got to wait until I get back where I was.’
