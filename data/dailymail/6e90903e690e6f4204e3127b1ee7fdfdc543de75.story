Johnny Weir announced in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday that he and on-again-off-again husband Victor Voronov are back together again.

The figure skating fashion cop broke the happy news of their second reconciliation in as many months in a 4am tweet along with a plea for privacy and a bit of understanding.

'My husband and I have happily reconciled,' wrote the 29-year-old. 'Please respect our privacy and integrity at this time.'

Aaaaand we're back! Figure skating fashionisto Johnny Weir took to twitter in the pre-dawn early monring hours Tuesday to announce that he and once-estranged husband Victor Voronov have again agreed to bury the bejeweled hatchet

'Love is dangerous,' he went on. 'Love is safe. Love is ugly. Love is beautiful.'

Weir and Voronov had been putting on a high-profile display of all love's aspects since first announcing their split in March.

'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together,' he tweeted back on March 19 in a subdued start to a roller coaster and very public breakup that ensued.

Days later, Weir told Access Hollywood of the 'personal hell' he was experiencing when the cameras turned off during his stint as a Sochi commentator because of Voronov, who he called abusive.

'Some of my closest friends have seen him hit me before,' he said at the time.

Not to be outdone, Weir's non-practicing, Georgetown-educated attorney husband shot back with accusations of Weir's infidelity.

TMZ revealed court documents in which Voronoz painted himself as a victim of Weir's theatrical self obsession and said Weir cheated on him with a porn star and a club owner.

TMZ also posted a photo allegedly showing a nasty little bite mark on Voronov's arm left by Weir after a spat.

According to Radar, it subsequently leaked that Weir used gay sex hookup app Grindr on which the skater sent  full-front naked selfies to other men.

The battle raged, though with fewer tantalizing public details, until around mi-April.

Real victim? The couple's dog Tema became a source of drama as Voronov accused Weir of holding the canine hostage

Weir and Voronov married in what looked to be a match made in heaven back in 2011, but a little over two years in, things publicly started to go down hill fast.

Because they also went uphill just as quickly--and on more than one occasion--here is a timeline of the breakups and makeups and some of the juicy bits therein.

Breakup, March 19: Weir announced the split via a tweet that read, 'My husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts, and I wish him well.

Weir quickly decided he no longer wished Voronov well as he accused the out of work lawyer of physical and emotional abuse.

Voronov shot back with accusations of mÃ©nage Ã  trois infidelities, Weir's own violent streak (he said Weir bit him) and a claim that the skater was holding their little dog Tema hostage.

Makeup, April 14: Voronov reportedly agreed to reconcile and move back into the couple's home, but only if Weir agreed to publicly apologize.

The next day, Weir hit back with a sexually explicit 5-page 'post-nuptial' agreement.

Breakup, April 16: it was revealed that the couple were not patching things up after all, which Voronov publicly blamed on Weir's mother Pamela.

Weir remained mostly silent after this breakup.

Makeup, May 6: Weir took to Twitter at 4am to happily announce his second reconciliation with Voronov in two months, writing:

'To love hard, is the greatest gift, even with all it's flaws. Keep shining.'

That's when makeup number one came as Voronov agreed to move back in with Weir so long as he agree to a list of stipulations that included a public apology from Weir and written agreement that the skater's mother must butt out of their married life.

Weir then shot back the next day with a bizarre 'post-nuptial agreement' with the reality star's own demands.

The 5-page document included a list of no-no's like extramarital sexting and mutual masturbation outside the marriage, denied each the right to be 'in close range' of any exes and required bi-yearly STD tests from both parties.

Something 
about the list must not have settled well with Voronov, because the 
following day the couple were off again thanks to Weir's mom Patti, who 
Voronov told Us Weekly was 'definitely the source of the breakdown of 
our marriage.'

Fast
 forward to 4am on Tuesday morning and, without revealing how fences 
were mended or if his mother finally butt out, Weir happily announced he
 was back with Voronov.

He tweeted following his announcement:

'To love hard, is the greatest gift, even with all it's flaws. Keep shining.'
