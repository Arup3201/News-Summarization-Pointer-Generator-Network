You'd think Prince Philip would go easy on the politically incorrect jokes when opening a new cardiac centre.

After all, it was just over a year ago that the 91-year-old Royal had heart surgery after suffering chest pains.

But the outspoken Prince proved he’s incorrigible at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, telling a Filipino nurse: ‘The Philippines must be half-empty – you’re all here running the NHS.’

Royal quip: The Duke of Edinburgh told this Filipino nurse at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital  her country must be 'half empty', because so many of her compatriots have come to the UK to work for the NHS

Are there any of you left? The 91-year-old joked with the Filipino nurse and her colleagues during a visit to Luton and Dunstable Hospital to open a new cardiac centre earlier today

The Prince made his remark as he opened a £5.5million facility on Tuesday. The nurse seemed to take his joke in good humour and laughed.

The 91-year-old royal, who calls 
himself 'the world's most experienced curtain puller',  asked when the hospital would
 get a helipad to save him a journey by car. He had apparently been keen
 to visit after undergoing heart surgery himself just over a year ago.

As he visited the new cardiac centre, the Duke was presented with a gold plated coronary arterial stent - similar to the one used during his own surgery.

‘Ah - a spare, just in case!, ’ the smiling Duke quipped, before attempting to perform the procedure himself using the equipment on the new wing.

Buckingham Palace said last night that it would not comment on a 'private conversation'.

Royal sources insisted, however, that 
the prince would never intend to cause offence and liked to make the odd
 joke 'to put people at ease'.

Happy greeting: Prince Philip shakes the hand of the Filipino nurse as he makes her giggle with his joke

On good form: The Duke of Edinburgh was in a 'jovial' mood and joked about the hospital installing a helipad to save him the car journey

Royal opening: The Duke of Edinburgh visited the hospital to unveil a £5.5million cardiac centre

'It was a very jovial visit, with lots of laughing all round. The Duke was on very good form,' they said.

The hospital spokesperson added: 
'Staff greatly enjoyed the opportunity to meet the Duke of Edinburgh. We
 regard all conversations he had with our staff and guests as private 
and therefore would not comment on them.

'Luton is a very cosmopolitan town and the working staff at Luton and Dunstable Hospital reflects that.'

The latest figures suggest that 16,184 of the 670,000 nurses in the UK are from the Philippines – which has a population of 94.8million.

Viewed by some as 'refreshingly open' 
but by others as somewhat politically incorrect, Prince Philip has 
always possessed a propensity to shock.

Last year the Duke followed tradition
 as he walked past a pretty young woman in red and exclaimed 'I would 
get arrested if I unzipped that dress!’

Prince
 Phillip and the Queen were on a Royal visit to Bromley, Kent, when he 
spotted 25-year-old Hannah Jackson, turned to the policeman standing 
next to her and gestured towards her eye-catching zip-up dress.

Former Scottish Tory leader Annabel Goldie (left) was asked by the Duke of Edinburgh if she wore tartan knickers at a papal reception in 2009. And the prince was in a spot of bother again in 2001 after telling a 13-year-old Andrew Adams (right) he would need to lose weight if he wanted to be an astronaut

In 1986 he told British students in Peking: 'If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.'

Seven years later, he told a Briton 
living in Hungary: 'You can't have been here long. You've not got a pot 
belly.' His remarks apparently alluded to the Hungarians' love of food 
and drink.

Closer to home, he caused a storm 
while touring a factory in Edinburgh in August 1999 when he remarked 
that a fuse box 'looked as though it had been put in by an Indian'.

Again in Scotland, he outraged locals 
when he asked a driving instructor he met on a walkabout in Oban in 
1995: 'How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them
 past the test?'.

His other foot-in-mouth remarks 
include telling a group of teenagers from the British Deaf Association 
in Cardiff who were standing near a loud Caribbean steel band: 'If 
you're near that music it's no wonder you're deaf.'

On February 11, the Duke of Edinburgh attended Sunday morning church Service at Sandringham Church, Norfolk, and left this policeman chuckling with an off-the-cuff comment that was not reported

Some of his off-the-cuff remarks have proved more amusing, however.

When asked if he knew the Scilly Isles, off the coast of Cornwall, he joked: 'Yes, my son owns them.'

And of his daughter, Princess Anne, he jested: 'If it doesn't fart or eat hay, she is not interested.'

Phil Dampier author of Prince Philip: 
Wise Words and Golden Gaffes said: 'This is a classic Prince Philip 
comment. I have no doubt that he doesn't mean to offend and the nurse 
took no offence. He makes these comments to break the ice and put people
 at ease.

'That said, there is no doubt that 
sometimes he does overstep the mark and people are genuinely taken aback
 or upset by his comments.'

Mr Dampier pointed out that when the 
prince asked an islander in the Cayman Islands during a 1994 visit: 
'Aren't most of you descended from pirates?', the man appeared to be 
genuinely offended.

The Duke is well-known for his 
outspoken comments, here are some of his most memorable:
