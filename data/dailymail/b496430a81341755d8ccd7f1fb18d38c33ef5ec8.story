A 15-year-old Santa Ana, California girl tragically died two days after she was seriously injured chasing after a mugger who swiped her new iPhone.

Rubi Rubio was walking her 7-year-old sister from home on July 3 when a man came up and stole the phone, fleeing in a light grey or silver Pontiac driven by another unidentified man, local police said.

Rubio, who had just got the iPhone as a reward for good work in school, chased after the thief and grabbed onto the back of the car near the intersection of Warner and Towner streets.

Rubio was gravely injured when the driver swerved to throw the teen from the vehicle and onto the street. 

Rubio was taken to the hospital where her family stood watch for two days hoping she would recover.

But the girl's condition deteriorated and on Saturday she passed away.

'She only opened her eyes, looked at me for like five seconds and said "mom" and that was the last word I heard from her,' Rubio's mother Marisol Hernandez told KCAL.

Police are still searching for the man who stole the iPhone, which was later recovered after being thrown from the vehicle.

The suspect has been described as an Hispanic man in his late 20s to early 30s, 5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10 inches tall with medium build.

He was last seen wearing a black baseball cap, white tank top and light colored jeans.

Friends and family have described Rubio, who celebrated her Quinceanera this year, as a happy girl who always had a smile on her face.

'They have no heart,' friend Maria Saucedo todl NBC Los Angeles. 'That was dumb, what they did to her.'
