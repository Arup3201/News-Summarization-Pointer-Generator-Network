A self-proclaimed financial whizz-kid - who once spent £200,000 on a single bar bill - appeared in court today accused of running an unauthorised investment scheme.

Foreign currency trader Alex Hope, 24, of Docklands, east London, hit the headlines in March 2012 when he reportedly bought Britain’s most expensive round of drinks at a nightclub in Liverpool.

But he was arrested at his flat during a raid by City of London Police in April this year on suspicion of financial services offences and fraud.

City rules state that while Hope is allowed to trade currencies to make his own profit, he must have a licence from the Financial Standards Authority to work on behalf of others.

Hope, wearing a navy blue suit, white 
shirt, black v-neck sweater and no tie, spoke only to confirm his name 
and address when he appeared at City of London Magistrates’ Court today.

He was joined in the dock by Raj Vanbadlo, 55, who is charged with involvement in the investment scheme and of withdrawing £95,000 in alleged criminal proceeds.

Hope, a former Wembley stadium catering manager, reinvented himself as a day-trading currency markets expert and spent £125,000 on a giant bottle of champagne as part of his huge bar tab.

He is also said to have entertained the likes of Coleen Rooney and England footballer Adam Johnson at the PlayGround nightclub in Liverpool’s Hilton hotel.

Hope was charged by the Financial Conduct Authority over the allegedly unauthorised investment scheme which is believed to have collected £5million.

He faces two charges of carrying on a regulated activity without authorisation, two offences of unauthorised financial promotion and one count of fraud by false representation.

Vanbadlo faces two charges of unauthorised financial promotion, one count of carrying on a regulated activity without authorisation, one charge of inviting others to engage in an investment activity, and one count of withdrawing criminal proceeds.

Vanbadlo, of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, and Hope are yet to enter any pleas. The pair were released on conditional bail ahead of a preliminary hearing at Southwark Crown Court on July 30.
