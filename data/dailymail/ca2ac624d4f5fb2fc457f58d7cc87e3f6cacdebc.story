Norwich are facing a fight to keep John Ruddy at the club for their tilt at an instant Premier League return.

The goalkeeper will consider his future at the Carrow Road should a Premier League club offer him regular first-team football next season.

He just missed out on selection for England's World Cup squad and knows staying in the top-flight will enhance his chances of remaining in Roy Hodgson's thoughts.

Heading for the exit? John Ruddy could leave Norwich after their relegation from the Premier League

National pride: Ruddy knows he must be playing in the top-flight to catch the eye of England boss Roy Hodgson

While the 27-year-old feels emotionally attached to the Canaries, he would find it hard to resist a move back to the top-flight.

However, the keeper is unlikely to consider leaving Carrow Road for a club without the guarantee of first-team football.

Uncertain future: Palace could move for Ruddy with Julian Speroni's position in the balance

Ruddy rejected a move to Chelsea last summer over fears that he'd spend the majority of his time warming the bench.

Crystal Palace are monitoring Ruddy's situation as fears grow over the future of current No. 1 Julian Speroni.
