Guilty: Patrick Moran, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in Washington on Wednesday morning

The girlfriend of a Congressman's son has told police he did not attack her and instead she broke her nose after falling when her high heel snapped.

Her claim is despite the fact her boyfriend, Patrick Moran, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in Washington on Wednesday morning.

The 23-year-old son of Democratic Virginia Rep. Jim Moran, had reportedly been dating Kelly Hofmann for six months when the incident took place at outside a bar earlier this month.

According to a court document, seen by the Washington Examiner on December 1, a police officer outside the Getaway at 1400 Meridian Place NW observed Moran 'grab a white female by the back of her head with his hand and slam her head into the metal trash can cage in front of the nightclub.'

The female identified herself as Kelly 
Hofmann and said the pair had been drinking heavily and arguing inside 
the bar about Moran talking to another woman.

After the incident at 1:23am, Ms Hofmann was bleeding from her nose, and her right eye was 'extremely swollen,' the report said.

An ambulance technician told police her injuries looked like a broken nose and skull fracture under her right eye and Ms Hofmann was taken to Howard University Hospital.

But on Wednesday Ms Hofmann released a statement contradicting the police report:      

'This was an accident that has been blown out of proportion. The statements in the police report are inaccurate. Pat and I were arguing, one of my high heels gave out, and I fell into the side of a trashcan. On impact, I fractured my nose. False conclusions were made as a result. I hope our privacy will be respected.'

A source close to Rep. Moran told ARLnow.com said
that Ms Hofmann did not press charges and testified in Morans' defense 
adding that she suffered from no broken bones and is back at work.

Moran’s court-appointed attorney, Gretchen Franklin, told the Washington Post that the couple were still together and that prosecutors declined to dismiss the case even though Hofmann wanted them to.

Patrick Moran is one of Jim Moran's four children and in a statement to Washington City Paper, Rep. Moran described his son and his girlfriend as 'good kids.'

'I hope their privacy will be respected,' the congressman said.

'They look forward to putting this embarrassing situation behind them.'

His office released the following statement about the incident: 'The Congressman strongly condemns domestic violence. As was stated in court by both his son Patrick and his girlfriend Kelly, the situation was an accident.

'They were the only two people involved in the scene. In that sense, their statements are the only ones that matter.

'They are both very embarrassed by the situation, which involved drinking, and they are looking to move past it, and ask for their privacy to be respected.'

Although he was originally charged 
for felony domestic violence assault, Moran got off on simple assault 
and was sentenced to probation.

A D.C. Superior Court judge suspended a 90-day jail term and sentenced Moran to one year’s probation.

He will also have to complete domestic-violence counseling and 50 hours of community service.

Caught in the act: The video shows Patrick Moran discussing how to cast fraudulent ballots

It is not the first time this year that Moran has hit the headlines - in October he was forced to resign from his father's re-election campaign after he was caught on video discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots.

Patrick Moran had been a field director for his father's campaign.

The resignation came hours after Project Veritas, an organization led by activist James O'Keefe, released a video showing an undercover operative pitching a voter-fraud plan to Patrick Moran.

In the past Jim Moran, who has represented Northern Virginia in Congress since 1991. has also been accused of domestic violence.

His second wife, Mary Howard Moran, called the police on her then-husband in 1999, claiming that he'd hit her, although no charges were filed over the alleged assault.
