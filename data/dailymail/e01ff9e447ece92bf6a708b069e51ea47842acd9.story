Hooves clash, teeth are bared and dust clouds billow around a whirl of black and white.

These stunning pictures capture the moment a pair of zebras kick, bite and tear at each other to earn their stripes as leader of the pack.

Ruthless: No mercy is spared by either party as the male zebras engage in terrifying territorial combat

The male zebras, believed to be around 
four years old, were photographed engaging in the spectacular display of
male dominance in Etosha National Park in north-east Namibia, Africa.

One zebra, believed to be the herd leader, is seen being antagonised and threatened by another younger male.

After a couple of attempts to ignore the intruder, the pack leader strikes with terrifying power and accuracy.

While
they make very little noise during their brutal engagement, the creatures
kick up the surrounding dust while they battle it out to get to the 
top.

Wildlife photographer Judy Malloch camped out to watch the zebras in hoof-to-hoof combat.

Mrs Malloch, 69, said: 'It was fascinating. The zebras are very frisky and love to run and jump.

Don't try me: Tensions arise when a young buck tries to rile the leader of the herd with a few mocking nibbles, but the boss isn't having any of it... yet

'One Zebra was antagonising the other - he seemed to want to challenge the male to show dominance.

'They are usually very placid but sometimes they get into combat situations where they can become very mean.'

Mrs Malloch spotted the zebras among 30 others which were returning from a water hole.

Upper cut: Things start to get nasty as one zebra goes for the leg and the other takes a chunk out of his opponent's ear

'They were battling to dominate the group,' said Mrs Malloch.

'The fighting starts and it can get very aggressive. They can break another zebra's leg when they kick - it's pretty brutal.

'They fight for a while and then cool off for a bit. If it's not too hard they will come back and battle.

Headlock: The two zebras, believed to be around four years old, hurl all their weight into each blow of the battle

'They
pin each other on to the ground and then they will break up for a bit.

'One decides it's not going to give in and they go on to bite the other 
around the neck and leg area.

'The others in the group stand around and watch. Some ignore it but others want to know what is going on.'

All-out war: Wildlife photographer Judy Malloch took the incredible shots in the early hours of the morning

Mrs Malloch and her husband Gary travel frequently, particularly in areas with diverse wildlife.

She said: 'We stayed in four different camps during our stay.

'But we wanted a safari where we are really in control and can stay in locations for as long as we need to.

Steer clear: Other zebras watch from the sidelines, curious to find out who will win the bloodthirsty battle

'The zebras were fascinating. They are beautiful and unusual. Each is one of a kind.

'They want to fight for their family and being in their prime, the zebras battling can be quite furious.'

The fascinating pictures, which were taken during the morning hours, show the animals in their true natural glory.

Surrender: The aggressor is defeated, order is restored, and the herd returns to its quieter state of normality

'They are beautiful creatures,' said Mrs Malloch.

'Their creators did a great job of designing them. Each one is an individual and they're fascinating animals.

'They're very interesting to watch. They protect one another no matter what.'

The fight quickly subsided as the zebras settled their differences.

Mrs Malloch added: 'They got back to normal very quickly. Everything quietened down and they got back to worrying about their food.

'Luckily we didn't see anything on this occasion that resulted in damage. One turned away and gave in, before saying "you win!" to the other.'
