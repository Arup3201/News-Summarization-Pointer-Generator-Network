A well earned holiday seems to have done the Queen a world of good.

The Queen was seen at Kings Lynn station this morning looking refreshed in a tailored mauve coat.

The monarch, who has not been conducting official duties since the traditional Christmas day church service attended by the Royal family, was spotted boarding a train back to London after her Christmas break at the Royal residence in Sandringham, Norfolk.

The 87-year-old braved the chilly weather and fierce winds on the platform in a snug-looking button down coat with matching silk trim which fell below her knees, which she wore over a dress of the same shade.

Appearing to be returning to the capital without Prince Phillip, her Majesty wore a pair of plain black gloves to protect her hands from the cold, and seemed to be clutching one of her signature head scarves in her left hand as she was guided along the platform by security staff and network rail personnel.

She has been staying in her beloved Sandringham estate since 22 December, where she led 30 members of the Royal family to the traditional Christmas church service just half a mile from Sandringham house.

The house, set in 24 hectares of stunning gardens, allows ample opportunity for the Queen to indulge of her love of the countryside and its pursuits.

As has become tradition, the Queen accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children when she attended a church service on the Sandringham estate early this month

Her Majesty will need her renewed energy levels as, together with 92-year-old Prince Phillip, she is preparing to embark on a fresh year of milestones and major events, including an historic trip to meet the new Pope in his Vatican B&B and a state visit to France.

Earlier this month the couple visited the Church of St Peter and Paul, which is on the Sandringham estate, where they were greeted by a host of well-wishers.

One cheeky child even gifted Prince Philip with a box of chocolate éclairs instead of the traditional flowers as the royal couple left the church – which the Duke looked delighted to receive.
