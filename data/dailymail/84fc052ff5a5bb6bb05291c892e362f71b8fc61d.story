Air traffic control tapes released Sunday shed light into the cockpit as a student pilot navigated his broken plane into an emergency landing on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx.

Pilot Michael Schwartz had taken out two female passengers for a flight around the Statue of Liberty on Saturday when he encountered engine troubles on the way back to Danbury, Connecticut.

He called air traffic control around 3:20pm asking for guidance and remained levelheaded even when the controller didn't come up with a ton of options for possible landing areas.

'Mayday, mayday...we're losing engine power,' the pilot of the Piper Pa-28 says.

Owner: The plane is registered to Michael Schwartz of South Salem, New York. The other two women on board were not identified

In the call he asks for a place to 
make an emergency landing, and the air traffic controller points out 
that La Guardia Airport in Queens is five miles away.

'I'll never make it, where do I touch down?'

At that point the air traffic controller struggles for a while to think up another option

'I'm
 not sure where you can touch down if you're not going to make it,' he 
says before throwing out the idea of Harlem River or Major Deegan.

He
 quickly changes his mind on landing on the Major Deegan however since 
its populated and points the pilot in the direction Van Cortlandt Park 
which is 1,100 acres.

By then it was too late.

'I'm at less than 1,000 feet,' Schwartz said just as he landed on the freeway.

Mr Schwartz made the landing, saving himself and the two passengers and without hitting any of the cars on the freeway.

'Looks
 like we made a pretty good landing here,' he said once on the ground. 
'Looks like there isn't much damage to the aircraft at all.'

Only option: The air traffic controller suggested landing in Van Cortlandt Park, but Mr Schwartz was too far off

Witnesses were astounded as the plane made its shaky descent on the highway.

One quick-thinking maintenance worker rushed to help alerting cars to move out of the way as he saw the craft coming in.

'The propeller wasn't moving and it went down right over us,' Jarel Paul, who was driving along the road with friends, told the Daily News.

He added that as they spotted the plane, one of his friends was yelling: 'It's flying low, it's low.'

The two passengers have not been named but it was revealed the plane was heading back to Danbury, 
Connecticut, after the pilot and passengers had taken a flying visit 
around the Statue of Liberty.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, Schwartz's wife spoke of her relief and pride.

'It is amazing. I'm just thankful he learned how to land well,â€
