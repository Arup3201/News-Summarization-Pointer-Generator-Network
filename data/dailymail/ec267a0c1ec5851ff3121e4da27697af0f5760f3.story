President Barack Obama jets off to India in the wee hours of Saturday morning, in the hope of making progress on climate change negotiations and national security talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

The visit is largely ceremonial, though, timed to coincide with Republic Day festivities, which mark the day in 1950 when the country's Constitution took effect. But global warming is on the agenda, along with other issues including India's intensifying disputes with Pakistan.

The president will not visit Pakistan, unlike on his previous visit. He and the first lady plan to be back in Washington, D.C. early on Wednesday so he can partcipate in a farewell ceremony for outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel. 

America's military draw-down in Afghanistan and ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran will also be on the menu in India. 

'From the time the president took office, he's made increasing U.S. engagement with India a top foreign policy priority, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications Ben Rhodes told reporters on Thursday. 

But the world's two largest democracies have seen deep tensions in recent years.

So the White House was caught off guard when Modi invited Obama to be the first American president to attend the Republic Day events. Obama will be the first U.S. president to visit India twice while in office.

'It took us by some surprise,' said Rhodes. 'There's a great affinity between the United States and India and our people, but there's also a history that is complicated and that would have made it seem highly unlikely that a U.S. president would be sitting with India's leaders at their Republic Day ceremony.'

After some internal deliberations, the White House accepted Modi's offer. The president and first lady Michelle Obama arrive in New Delhi early Sunday, local time, for a three-day visit that includes a fresh round of bilateral meetings, an economic summit with U.S. and Indian business leaders and a visit to the famed Taj Mahal.

The city of Agra, where the monument is located, has mobilized 600 people to clean streets, round up stray dogs and clear cows from the streets.

Authorities have ordered a lockdown around the complex.

'There are a lot of spit stains and such that need to be washed away. The streets need to be spick and span,' said India's former chief archaeologist KK Mohammed, who has guided world leaders around the white marbled mausoleum.

'You cannot have a VVVIP of the world come to the Taj Mahal and let him see that,' Mohammed told the Agence France-Presse news agency. 

The president's visit is expected to be heavy on symbolism and lighter on substantive advances. Indian political commentator Ashok Malik said expectations for concrete deliverables during the visit are 'below the standards usually set by U.S. presidents when they travel across the world for a three-day visit.'

Still, U.S. and Indian officials appear to agree that even a symbolic show of solidarity between the leaders would be a sign of progress after recent difficulties.

While military cooperation and U.S. defense sales have grown, Washington has been frustrated by India's failure to open up to more foreign investment and to address complaints alleging intellectual property violations.

India's liability legislation has also prevented U.S. companies from capitalizing on a landmark civil nuclear agreement between the two countries in 2008.

Relations hit a new low in 2013 when India's deputy consul general, Devyani Khobragade, was arrested and strip-searched in New York over allegations that she lied on visa forms to bring her maid to the U.S. while paying the woman a pittance. 

The official's treatment caused outrage in New Delhi, and India retaliated against U.S. diplomats.

For Modi, hosting Obama at the Republic Day parade caps off a year of high-profile diplomatic maneuvers by a leader who was once shunned by the international community and even denied a U.S. visa in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the Indian state where he was the top elected official.

The visit ties in neatly with Modi's election promise that he would turn around Asia's third-largest economy. And it could send a message to Pakistan and China – India's closest neighbors and rivals – that Modi has a powerful ally in the United States.

'Modi has used the invitation as a way of signaling that the United States really looms large in his calculations for where he want to take India,' said Ashley Tellis, a senior associate at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

U.S. officials say they hope the improving relationship between Obama and Modi will have payoffs in the policy arena.

The White House plans to push India on climate change, particularly after reaching a sweeping agreement with China on limiting carbon emissions. The president will also be accompanied on his trip by several U.S. business leaders in hopes of forging new partnerships with India.

The centerpiece of Obama's visit will be Monday's celebrations, which are partly a Soviet-style display of India's military hardware and partly a Macy's Thanksgiving Day-type parade with floats from across the country highlighting India's cultural diversity.

The parade, once a huge attraction, has lost much of its sheen for India's elite over the past decade. But it continues to draw tens of thousands of visitors eager to view the spectacle at least once in their lifetimes.
