Primitive organisms may have existed on Mars during a period when life was forming on Earth.

This is according to a recent study by Opportunity rover which suggests Mars may have been capable of supporting microbial life for hundreds of millions of years.

Opportunity, which celebrates 10 years of Mars exploration today, has uncovered evidence that benign, neutral-pH water flowed on Mars around four billion years ago.

Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission.

Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years.

The rover is currently at 'Solander Point' at the rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars.

The rover hasn't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet.

During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals.

Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water.

The evidence comes from samples from the rim of a 3.7 billion year old crater, named Endeavour, and is believed to be the earliest evidence of water activity yet discovered.

Opportunity investigated the rocks at a spot dubbed Matejivic Hill.

The samples revealed a type of clay that commonly forms on Earth when water flows through fractures in the rock.

The finding adds to the more-recent Curiosity mission, which found evidence of ancient habitability 3.5 billion years ago.

‘These [benign] water conditions existed over a long period of time,’ Ray Arvidson, lead author of the new study and Opportunity deputy principal investigator told Space.com.

Scientists believe that that life first started on Earth nearly four billion years ago.

Professor Arvidson suggests life may have been able to survive on Mars for longer stretches that previously believed, at a time when life was getting a foothold on our own planet.

‘Maybe not globally,’ he told he told SPACE.com. ‘[Habitable environments] could have occurred here and there regionally. And it may not have been for the whole time continuously. We don't know.’

Opportunity touched on Mars ten years ago today, three weeks after its twin, Spirit.

Both robots were tasked with 90-day missions to seek out signs of past water activity on Mars. Spirit was declared dead in 2011, but Opportunity is still operational.

Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. 10 years later, and it is still active on the red planet
