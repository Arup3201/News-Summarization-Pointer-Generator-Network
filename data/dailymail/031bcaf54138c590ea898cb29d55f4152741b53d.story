Clash: Mr Justice Saunders demanded an explanation for the PM's strong statement

David Cameron was embroiled in an extraordinary clash with an Old Bailey judge yesterday as he was accused of almost wrecking the final stages of the £100million phone-hacking trial.

Mr Justice Saunders reacted furiously to the Prime Minister’s decision to brand Andy Coulson a liar as the jury was still deliberating over two charges against the former Downing Street spin doctor.

The judge also hit out at other politicians – including Labour leader Ed Miliband, Chancellor George Osborne, London mayor Boris Johnson and John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons media committee – who ‘made strong comments’ about Coulson.

He wrote to Mr Cameron demanding an explanation for his comments, which were attacked in court as ‘ill-advised and premature’ and said to be unprecedented from a prime minister during a high-profile criminal trial.

The judge contrasted the politicians’ indecent haste to comment on the case with the restraint shown by journalists.

He said: ‘The Press in court have been extremely responsible in their reporting of this case but when politicians regard it as open season one cannot expect the Press to remain silent.’

A Government source accused the judge 
of being at fault, having not applied reporting restrictions until the 
case was concluded. ‘He opened the stable door and expected the horse 
not to bolt. It is a ridiculous state of affairs,’ the source said.

Coulson
 was found guilty on Tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones and is 
expected to be sentenced next week.

Carpeted: David Cameron was accused by Coulson's QC of using the verdict to score political points

The jury was discharged yesterday 
after failing to agree verdicts on charges that he and former News of 
the World royal editor Clive Goodman made corrupt payments to police. Prosecutors will decide on Monday whether they will face a retrial on 
these charges.

On the dramatic final day of a trial which dragged on for eight months:

Mr
 Cameron hired Coulson weeks after he resigned from the News of the 
World following the 2007 jailing of Goodman for a phone-hacking offence.

In the Commons, the Prime Minister insisted the Leveson Inquiry into 
Press standards had examined his failure to heed warnings about the 
risks of taking Coulson into No 10 and Coulson’s vetting process 
‘exhaustively’ and found him not to be at fault.

The
 Old Bailey heard that the judge had contacted Downing Street to demand 
an explanation for Mr Cameron’s televised statement on Tuesday, after 
the first verdicts, in which he said Coulson had given him ‘false 
assurances’.

Mr Justice 
Saunders said: ‘The jury were not aware of that before and it is a 
matter which is capable of affecting Mr Coulson’s credibility in their 
eyes.’

Clearly exasperated,
 he told the court he would have expected Mr Cameron and other 
politicians to wait for the jury to complete their decisions before 
making comments, adding: ‘I don’t know whether it was just done in 
ignorance or whether it was done deliberately.’

It
 was the second time the Prime Minister has been criticised for 
jeopardising a high-profile trial. Late last year he was rebuked for 
comments about a trial involving TV chef Nigella Lawson.

Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron had taken legal advice from Attorney General Dominic Grieve about what could be said.

Mr
 Miliband said Mr Cameron would go down in history as ‘the first-ever 
occupant of his office who brought a criminal into the heart of Downing 
Street’.

'I don't know whether it was just done in ignorance or whether it was done deliberately'

Mr Justice Saunders

The News of the World’s former managing editor, Stuart Kuttner,
 who was also cleared during the trial, said he and his former 
colleagues were the victims of a state-sponsored stitch-up.

The
 74-year-old told Channel 4 News he and others were ‘rounded up’ because
 police and prosecutors wanted to ‘take on the Press’.

‘What lies behind it was, in my view, an absolute unmerited assault on a free Press,’ he added.

Three
 former news editors at the paper and private investigator Glenn 
Mulcaire have admitted hacking and will be sentenced next week with 
Coulson.

In an apparent 
justification of the huge costs of the case, Greg McGill, a senior 
lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘This case was not about
 whether phone hacking took place or whether public officials were paid 
for information – there are a significant number of recent convictions 
which show that both did happen.

‘This
 has been a lengthy and complex trial which was required to explore a 
culture of invading privacy. The judge agreed that the evidence was 
sufficient for consideration by the jury.’
