Paris may be at risk of losing its reputation as the city of love after installing glass and wooden panels on a historic bridge where tourists from around the world have famously attached tens of thousands of ‘love locks’.

Glass panels have replaced the traditional railings and wire fencing on part of Pont des Arts to prevent amorous couples from attaching padlocks inscribed with their names, initials or messages of affection.

There are plans to add a third see-through panel and expand the experiment to other bridges as the French capital cracks down on ‘visual pollution’ and attempts to make the blighted bridges safer following a dangerous incident earlier this year.

Killing the romance: Glass panels have replaced traditional railings and wire fencing on part of Pont des Arts

Tradition: Tourists attach padlocks inscribed with names, initials or messages and toss the keys into the Seine

Pont des Arts, a little footbridge over the River Seine, is one of the city’s best-known symbols of romance thanks to the ‘love locks’, but it is at risk of losing its identity if its metal fencing is replaced with glass panels.

That would satisfy Paris officials and residents, who have long bemoaned the tradition of attaching a padlock as a symbol of undying love and tossing the key in the river. 

Paris Deputy Mayor Bruno Julliard told Le Parisien: ‘Paris is the capital of love, we are all very proud of that, but there are more beautiful ways of showing that love than by putting padlocks on a bridge.’

He said the locks are a costly hazard because they are damaging the city’s bridges and jeopardising visitors’ safety due to the added weight.

Losing its identity? Pont des Arts is a symbol of romance in Paris thanks to the 'love locks'

In June, part of Pont des Arts’ railing collapsed under the weight of the locks, forcing police to close the iconic structure while repairs were made.

Earlier this year, two American students who live in Paris launched a ‘No Love Locks’ campaign

The metal bridge was originally completed in 1804 but it had to be rebuilt in the 1980s due to damage caused by aerial bombings during the First and Second World Wars.
