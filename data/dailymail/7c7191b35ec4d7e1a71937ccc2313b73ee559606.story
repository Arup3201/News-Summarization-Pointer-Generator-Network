Martin Murray is potentially one victory away from a clash with middleweight knockout artist Gennady Golovkin. 

The Kazakh stopped Marco Antonio Rubio in the second round in Los Angeles on Saturday night, his 18th consecutive early finish.

And the 32-year-old will return to the ring in Monaco in February for what will be his third visit to the principality.

Assuming Murray overcomes Domenico Spada this weekend, he will be among the favourites to face the IBO and WBA 'Super' champion.

Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler admitted Murray is a 'natural' opponent for his charge and that American broadcaster HBO are keen on the fight.

Other options for Golovkin include Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr and fellow world champion Miguel Cotto. 

Murray's fight against Spada is his third and final on his promotional deal with Golden Gloves which he signed earlier this year. 

The 32-year-old has twice before fought for a world title, drawing with Felix Sturm and losing to Sergio Martinez.

But he may have faced his toughest opponent to date on Saturday when he came face to face with Titan the Robot.

Standing at 8ft tall, the robot was in St Helens to promote the town's The Aliens Are Coming event. TItan has previously appeared on Big Brother and on stage with Rihanna.
