Outburst: Patrick Mercer branded Mr Cameron a 'despicable creature'

A senior Tory MP was last night accused of launching a tirade of abuse against David Cameron in which he allegedly described the Prime Minister as an 'a**e'.

Former Army colonel Patrick Mercer was also claimed to have witheringly dismissed Mr Cameron as 'a despicable creature' and 'the worst politician in British history since William Gladstone'.

The extraordinary remarks were allegedly recorded at a party in Central London last week.

Mr Mercer, a former homeland security 
spokesman for the Tories, denied making the comments even though The 
Mail on Sunday understands that the tape-recording has been played back 
to him.

However, the politician, 55,
 did admit suggesting that Home Secretary Theresa May would probably 
have to resign in the wake of the row over border agency controls being 
relaxed.

In the recording, obtained by the Sunday People, he claimed the Prime Minister would be ousted by next year.

Asked if backbenchers would launch a leadership coup, Mr Mercer replied: 'He'll go in the spring. He'll resign in the spring.'

According to reports last night, the Newark MP was taped as he attended the annual autumn party of The London Magazine.

He gave an address at the event after writing an article he titled: 'Rioting: A Very British Business.'

Criticism: Mr Cameron, pictured this week, was allegedly branded 'the worst politician since Gladstone'

Former BBC reporter Mr Mercer was joined at the event by the corporation's Middle East correspondent Jeremy Bowen.

Mr Mercer, an adviser to the literary magazine, was allegedly recorded saying:

Flattering comparison? The 19th century Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone

• 'Cameron was an a**e. That's a matter of fact, not politics.'

• 'I would take a beggar off the streets... rather than have Cameron.'

• 'He is the worst politician in British history since William Gladstone.'

• He wished Mr Cameron was never born

But in a statement last night, Mr Mercer said: 'I did not make those remarks.'

He told the Sunday People he had a 'friendly conversation' and talked about a lot of subjects.

The row comes four years after Mr Mercer was forced to resign as the Tories' homeland security spokesman when he made comments on race in the Army which Mr Cameron condemned as 'unacceptable'.

Mr Mercer had said that he had met 'a lot' of 'idle and useless' ethnic  minority soldiers who used racism as a 'cover'.

The former Sherwood Foresters colonel also appeared to say that being called a 'black b******” was a normal part of Army life.

At the time of his remarks the MP, who served in Northern Ireland and was commended for gallantry in 1990, said he 'deeply' regretted any offence he had caused.

The outspoken politician, who went on to be a security adviser to Labour
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown, was among backbenchers who rebelled last 
month over a referendum on European Union membership.

Mr Cameron put out an immediate statement about that incident apologising for Mr Mercer's comments, adding: 'We should not tolerate racism in the Army or in any walk of life. Patrick Mercer is no longer a shadow Minister.'
