Two RAF jets were scrambled from their base in Cyprus to urgently investigate Syrian planes that had crossed into international airspace, it has emerged.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed that unidentified planes legally crossed into Cypriot skies from the east of the country last Monday.

But it is understood the behaviour of the aircraft raised suspicions at RAF Akrotiri, less than 200 miles from Syria, prompting the rapid response.

The MoD deployed six Typhoon jets at the base in Akrotiri, Cyprus, las month as a 'purely a prudent and precautionary measure to ensure the protection of UK interests'

The aircraft retreated before any action was taken by the two RAF air-defence Typhoons.

A pair of Turkish F-16s are also believed to have been launched in support of the investigation from their base in Incirlik, Turkey.

The Syrian planes are believed to have been Russian-made Sukhoi Su-24s, a heavily-armed fighter bomber that can reach Cyprus, 200 miles from Syria, in just 15 minutes.

A spokesman for the MoD said: 'The MoD can confirm that Typhoon Air Defence Aircraft operated from RAF Akrotiri on Monday to investigate unidentified aircraft to the east of Cyprus; the aircraft were flying legally in international airspace and no intercept was required.'

A military source told the Sunday People: 'Recent intelligence reports have warned of an attack on Akrotiri.

'The RAF Typhoons were launched after sensitive airborne early-warning radarpicked up the "contacts" floying low and fast.'

Akrotiri is one of Britain's largest overseas bases and is home to more than 1,300 personnel. It was used in the air campaign against Gaddafi's Libya in 2011.

It comes amid rising global tensions with Syria as the U.S. seeks to build support for military strikes against President Bashar Asssad's regime.

Number 10 indicated last week that Britain is not expecting its military bases such as RAF Akrotiri to be used by allies in any air strikes.

RAF Akrotiri is used by the RAF as a base for overseas operations in the Middle East and also for training.

A week ago, six RAF Typhoon jets were sent to Cyprus in what the MoD called a 'prudent and precautionary measure'.

On its website, the MoD says Typhoon Jets provide the RAF with a 'multi-role combat aircraft, capable of being deployed in the full spectrum of air operations, from air policing, to peace support, through to high-intensity conflict'.
