Video footage has surfaced of an octopus making an amazing escape from an Alaskan fishing boat by squeezing itself through the tiniest of gaps.

The creature can be seen slithering towards the side of the vessel before improbably disappearing through the narrowest of spaces.

The footage was recorded by fisherman Chance Miller who offers guided tours of the Chiswell Islands in Alaska.

In the video, Miller can be heard telling his astonished passengers that the octopus will feel its way towards the water and squeeze its entire body through the tiny gap. 

It is an idea that everyone else seems only to willing to laugh off. 

'It's like trying to get my wife in her wedding dress,' scoffs one person. 'It ain't gonna happen.'

But much to everyone's surprise the creature proceeds to do just that,even if It isn't the speediest of disappearing acts. 

The North Pacific Octopus is the largest in the world. It has a 10 meter arm span and lives on average for 3-5 years.

The Chiswell Islands are a group of rocky, uninhabited islands in the Gulf of Alaska, which are only accessible by boat or plane.
