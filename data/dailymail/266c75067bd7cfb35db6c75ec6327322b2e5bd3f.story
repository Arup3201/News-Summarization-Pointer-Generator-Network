Death: Jimmy Mubenga (pictured with his wife) was being deported to Angola when he died

Three G4S detainee custody officers are to be charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of Jimmy Mubenga, the Crown Prosecution Service said today.

Mubenga, 46, was on a British Airways flight bound for his native Angola when security guards noticed he was not breathing. The father-of-five later died in hospital.

Officers Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig will now be charged with manslaughter after earlier inquest found that Mr Mubenga had been 'unlawfully killed' during his deportation.

The G4S guards had been tasked with removing Mr Mubenga on a British Airways flight to his native Angola in October 2010.

The inquest found Mr Mubenga died of cardio-respiratory collapse, where the heart stops beating and a person stops breathing.

Prosecutors decided in July 2012 that no charges should be brought in relation to Mr Mubenga’s death.

The case was reconsidered by the CPS after the inquest last year recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.

Kaler, 51, from Bedfordshire, Hughes, 53, from Hampshire, and Tribelnig, 38, from Surrey, have been charged with unlawful act manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter as alternatives, the CPS said.

However, G4S will not face charges of 
corporate manslaughter charges after the CPS decided there was 
insufficient evidence for such a prosecution.

Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of CPS 
Special Crime, said: 'We have completed a fresh review of all of the 
evidence relating to the death of Jimmy Mubenga, including the new 
evidence arising from the inquest, and decided that three men should be 
prosecuted for manslaughter.'

'There is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig.'

'Criminal proceedings are now under way and the defendants have a right to a fair trial.

Adrienne Makenda Kambana, Mr Mubenga's widow, said: 'My children and I have waited a long time for this decision. We hope the CPS will now move this case forward quickly. We feel like we are another step closer to getting justice for Jimmy.'

Mark Scott, solicitor for Mr Mubenga's family, with Bhatt Murphy solicitors, said: 'The family look to the Crown Prosecution Service now to ensure that they prosecute the case with the rigour and robustness required by the evidence available to them.'

'It has been a three-and-a-half year struggle for the family to get to this point and they hope to get on with their lives once this final challenge is met.'

Kaler, Hughes and Tribelnig will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on April 7.
