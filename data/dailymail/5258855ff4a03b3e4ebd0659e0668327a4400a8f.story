Parents who were saved from a sinking sailboat in Texas along with their seven children have been revealed as federal fugitives wanted in connection with $1million wire fraud.

Donald Brian Winberg, 43, Karlien Richel Winberg, 33 and the youngsters aged from one to 12 were rescued from Galveston Bay after their yacht flipped over in October.

They were brought safely to shore, lucky to be alive, but gave rescuers fake names and used aliases while they were being treated in hospital. Their one-year-old child and the mother were admitted overnight and released the next morning.

The FBI noticed them on local Houston TV reports, including dramatic footage of a baby being carried out of the water, and identified them as two suspects wanted for stealing millions from customers who believed they were investing in hay fields.

A trial date had been set for January but it was cancelled when the pair left the area. 

Officials now believe they have left the country and could have travelled to Mexico.

According to the Houston Chronicle, warning signs started to appear when authorities noticed the pair had bought the yacht with $20,000 cash the week before it sank.

The vessel was left in the water for a month before it was retrieved to regulations stipulating it must stay in the place it submerged for 20 days to allow the owners to return. 

They had been staying on the boat at the Watergate Yachting Center, but had been asked to leave due to disturbances. 

The boat was left in the water for a month after the incident and when detectives searched it, they reportedly found enough supplies for a long trip.

The parents had told officers that they were heading off on a long vacation to Mexico. 

Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset told the paper: 'We're just thinking of the kids and what will happen to them if the parents get arrested.'

Escape: Following the rescue, the parents told authorities they were leaving the area to go on a long vacation to Mexico. They are wanted in connection with $1million worth of wire fraud 

Jean Mahavier, a neighbor, told KHOU: 'It sat there for a month with no concern whatsoever. Boat that size doesn't come for nickels and dimes.

'It seemed clear to us neighbors, they were running from somebody. I understand they are wanted for something and it needs to be tended to.'

San Leon Volunteer Firefighter Chief Scott Lyons was involved in the rescue on the night. He told the station that the baby was blue and 'wasn't breathing'.  

According to the indictment in Colordao, the couple claimed they were running successful hay-making companies in Texas and Idaho. 

They would even show potential investors around the fields, but were in fact cheating them out of their money. 

The Winbergs were last seen in a 2004 Nissan SUV with Texas plates.
