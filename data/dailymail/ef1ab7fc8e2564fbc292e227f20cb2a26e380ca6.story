West Ham midfielder Diego Poyet is on a mission to make a name for himself in the Premier League - so people no longer refer to him by his father's name, Gus.

The 19-year-old has just recently returned to Upton Park after a month's loan at Championship side Huddersfield.

And Poyet could feature for the first time in three months for the Hammers, when he comes head-to-head against his father on Saturday, as Poyet Snr's Sunderland side entertain the high-flying Hammers at the Stadium of Light.

Gus Poyet will come face-to-face with his son, Diego, on Saturday as his Sunderland side face West Ham

He told The Sun: 'Do I get called Gus? Yes, I do - just five minutes ago I got called Gus! People forget.

'Even when I am playing, people are always comparing me, but when they see me play, they see we're different players. 

'Hopefully in the coming months I will be called Diego more. It would be nice for people to know of Diego Poyet at the end of the season.'

Sam Allardyce's side can move up to third in the table with a win over the Black Cats, as they look to continue their fine run of form in the Premier League.
