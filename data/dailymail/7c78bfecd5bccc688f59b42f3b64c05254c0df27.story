She's already made a solo porn film in a bid to pay her astronomical bills to raise her 14 children.

And over the weekend, Nadya 'Octomom' Suleman went to yet another desperate length in a bid to fund her family - by stripping.

The single mother, 37, was reportedly paid $5,000 (£3,220) to strip down to just her knickers as she grinded on-stage to the sounds of Rihanna at a Florida club on Friday night.

Making her debut on Friday 13th, Nadya was showered with dollar bills as she came out on stage at The Playhouse Gentlemen's Club in Miami.

For her first dance, she wore an Eyes Wide Shut-inspired PVC ensemble of mask, thigh-high boots, corset, bra and pants, while carrying a riding crop.

She then removed her outfit to the sound's of Rihanna's S&M, ending up in just her boots and knickers.

For her second dance, she changed 
into a sexy schoolgirl costume of pigtails, knee-high stockings and 
checked skirt as she performed to Rihanna's Rude Boy.

However, it appeared lapdancing isn't as easy as it looks, with Nadya apparently struggling to maintain a sense of rhythm.

One fellow dancer told the Miami Herald newspaper:
'She's really stiff .Oh my God, she can’t dance. But it’s good for the 
rest of us girls because she made it a busy Friday night. We’re going to
get extra tips.'

At one point, a fellow stripper had to help her remove her gloves as she struggled to remove the clingy PVC material.

Apparently the West Park club ended up attracting 400 customers - twice as many punters as usual.

As
well as the chance to pay $200 for a private one-to-one dance from the 
mother-of-14, customers could also buy 'I saw Octomom naked at the 
Playhouse South' T-shirts.

Nadya was apparently paid $5,000 for two 12-minute sets, not including tips and then $10-a-time for autographs.

Punters who wanted their photos taken with the burgeoning adult entertainment star had to pay $25.

The
club owner Greg Louis said it had been a great coup for the club to 
secure Nadya's performance: 'The phone’s been ringing off the hook. 
Several people asked me if it was really Octomom or just an 
impersonator.'

Nadya was originally set to perform at rival club T's Lounge, but cancelled after the manageress reportedly made negative comments about the single mother.

T's Lounge failed in a legal battle to ban her appearance after a Florida judge threw out the case on Thursday.

Nadya's stripping role comes two months after she made a solo porn film Octomom: Uncovered.

Nervous? Nadya looked quite calm backstage, despite making her stripping debut

In April, she reportedly filed for bankruptcy after running up to $1million in debts.

Octomom leaped to fame in 2009 when it was revealed she conceived octuplets through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), despite having six other children, no job and no partner to support her.

Despite her racy ventures, Nadya insists she has turned to God and will remain celibate until her children turn 18.

Top billing: Octomom was quite the draw for the Miami club, which attracted twice the amount of punters as normal
