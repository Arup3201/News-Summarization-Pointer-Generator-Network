Germany's demands for a ‘budget tsar’ to oversee tax and spending across the eurozone caused uproar yesterday.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said Brussels should have greater control over national budgets – including the right to send them back for changes.

But the call – made in a speech in Berlin just hours before last night’s European Union summit – sparked outrage across Europe.

Many governments fiercely oppose handing control of their national finances to unelected bureaucrats in a foreign capital.

Mrs Merkel’s demand came as more than 70,000 anti-austerity protesters took to the streets of Athens as part of a general strike.

Petrol bombs, bottles and chunks of marble were thrown at Greek police.

Officers responded with volleys of tear gas and stun grenades. One 65-year-old demonstrator later died of a heart attack.

In London, Treasury officials said 
the German proposals only related to the 17 eurozone countries and would
not include the UK. ‘We have made it very clear that this is something 
we are not going to do,’ said a source.

In
an address to Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, Mrs Merkel endorsed a
proposal for the EU’s monetary affairs commissioner to become an 
enforcer of the bloc’s budget rules.

Germany hopes that having a budget tsar will stop governments overspending and protect Europe against further bailouts.

‘We are of the opinion – and I speak 
for the whole of the German government on this – that we could go a step
further by giving Europe real rights of intervention in national 
budgets,’ said Mrs Merkel.

She added that she was ‘astonished’ by the Europe-wide opposition to the proposal and insisted that Germany was not ‘isolated’.

French President Francois Hollande insisted the creation of a budget tsar was not up for discussion at the Brussels meeting – the 22nd summit since the start of the eurozone debt crisis three years ago.

In a stinging rebuke to Mrs Merkel, he said: ‘The only decision that we have to take, to confirm, is putting in place a banking union by the end of the year. The first step is a banking supervisor.’

Mr Hollande – France’s first 
socialist president since the 1980s – wants a new banking supervisor put
in place as soon as possible to help support struggling lenders across 
the eurozone.

But European 
officials are struggling to thrash out the details, meaning few concrete
decisions are expected to emerge from the latest meeting of the EU’s 27
leaders.

Mrs Merkel insisted that ‘quality must come before speed’ in setting up the banking supervisor.

‘There
are a lot of very complicated legal questions, and I am not making the 
issue more difficult than it actually is,’ she said.

‘No major decisions are likely at the summit.’

Mrs Merkel has a far thornier relationship with Mr Hollande than she did with his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy.

Berlin
and Paris now no longer agree a united position before summits and 
strong-arm the rest of Europe into going along with their plans.

With
unemployment skyrocketing and growth grinding to a halt across the 
continent, the back-and-forth is beginning to frustrate some European 
officials.

Jose Manuel 
Barroso, who is president of the EU’s executive arm, the European 
Commission, criticised the heel-dragging ahead of the meeting.

‘There is not all over Europe the same sense of urgency,’ he said.

once again, the protests have turned violent with masked anarchists

Pressure is mounting on Spain to request a bailout – something the government in Madrid is reluctant to do.

‘It would be helpful if Spain asked for aid,’ said Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council. ‘But it is up to Spain to make up its mind.’

Yesterday’s general strike in Greece grounded flights, shut down public services and closed schools, hospitals and shops.

A three-hour stoppage by air traffic controllers led to flight cancellations for thousands of holidaymakers. Islands were also cut off as ferries stayed in ports.
