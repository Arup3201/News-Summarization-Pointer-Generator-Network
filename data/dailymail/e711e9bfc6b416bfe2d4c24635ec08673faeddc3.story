Snatcher: Brad Cooper, 47, was arrested earlier this month for picking up a 14-year-old at the boy's house in Massachusetts and driving him more than 2,000 miles back to his home in Chandler, Arizona. Cooper plead not guilty to more than 20 child sex abuse-related charges on Monday

A 47-year-old Chandler man has been accused of posing as a 16-year-old to lure a Massachusetts boy cross country.

Brad Cooper of Chandler appeared in Maricopa County Court for the first time on Monday as he pleaded not guilty to more than 20 counts of child sex-abuse.

Cooper was arrested on June 11, after local police found a missing 14-year-old boy from Pittsfield, Massachusetts at his home.

According to court documents, Cooper posed online as a 16-year-old named 'Trent Thompson' to start talking to the victim in April.

Cooper even spoke to the boy's mother over the phone as 'Trent', trying to convince her to let her son move to Arizona.

When she didn't agree, the two started talking about running away together and eventually Cooper showed up at the boy's home in Pittsfield to pick him up.

The two then drove back more than 2,000 miles to Cooper's home over a period of three days, making stops in New York, Indiana and Oklahoma.

After his arrest, Cooper admitted to engaging in several sexual acts with the minor while on the road and back in Chandler.

The boy was officially reported missing on June 6, and found five days later in Chandler when local police were notified of his disappearance.

When police showed up at Cooper's home on West Morelos Street, they questioned the man and found the boy nearby.

He is being held in Arizona without bond on 22 charges and could face further legal repercussions in Massachusetts.

A hearing date has been scheduled for mid-August.Â
