A mother who drowned after she drove into a pond frantically called her husband as her vehicle began sinking and told him that someone had driven her off the road, he has revealed.

Jennifer Lee Wolfe, a 35-year-old mother from St Petersburg, Florida, died in hospital after she was found inside her 2004 Honda early on Monday morning.

'She begged me to come find her, she said nobody stopped and nobody saw what happened,' her devastated husband James told WFLA. 'I heard her kind of scream, and then it sounded like water.'

Mrs Wolfe was driving home from a nearby Walmart around 12.30am when she approached a turn on 28th Street North but continued to drive straight rather than take the bend - causing her to strike a sign post in the center median and sending her across the lanes and down an embankment.

Loss: Jennifer Lee Wolfe, 35, called her husband James after she drove into a pond and began sinking

Tragedy: She said that someone had driven her off the road as she drove home in St Petersburg, Florida - but when rescue crews found her, she could not be saved and she was pronounced dead at hospital

Left behind: Mrs Wolfe, who was studying to be a nurse, is pictured with her husband and two sons

She hit a retention pond and as she 
began sinking, she called 911 - but hung up. Operators tried to call her
 back but there was no response and they could not locate from where she
 had made the call.

She then called her husband and told him she had been run off the road by another vehicle, TBO reported.

Investigators
 say the accident happened at about 12.36am. It is not know when she 
called her husband, but he contacted police at 12.57am.

He
 traveled to the scene and met with Pinellas Park police and Pinellas 
County deputies who found her unconscious inside her minivan at 1.16am.

Rescue crews pulled her from her vehicle and rushed her to Humana Northside Hospital, but she was pronounced dead.

Happier times: The couple are pictured together on their wedding day with one of their sons

Last words: James Wolfe said his wife begged him to find her - but she cut out and all he heard was water

Deadly route: She was driving north on this road when she failed to turn and ended up in the pond, left

Wreckage: Wolfe's Honda minivan, pictured, was pulled from the pond early on Monday morning

While pulling her minivan from the 
pond, dive crews also found another vehicle in the pond and removed it, 
but they said it is unrelated to the crash.

A Facebook profile for Mrs Wolfe suggests she had two young sons and studied nursing alongside being a stay-at-home mother.

St Petersburg police are continuing to investigate the cause of the crash and asked anyone with any information to contact them.

They
 have not elaborated about if another car did indeed driver her off the 
road and it does not appear that Wolfe had time to give a description of
 that vehicle, Fox13 reported

They closed the area of the crash - 28th Street North before Roosevelt Boulevard - for investigations but roads have now opened.

Scene: Emergency crews work at the scene on Monday morning but Mrs Wolfe could not be saved

Discovery: Bizarrely, authorities also found another car beneath Wolfe's in the pond, pictured, but they said it was not connected to the crash. The investigation into the cause is continuing
