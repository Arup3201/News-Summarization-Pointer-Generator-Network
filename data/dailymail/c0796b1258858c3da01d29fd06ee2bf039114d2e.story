Women are far more likely to buy a set of lingerie online if it's modeled on a brunette over a blonde, or on a plus-size model rather than an 'in-betweenie' - according to new market research.

Adore Me, a fast-growing online lingerie retailer, has built its business around painstakingly testing which models, themes and poses lead to more sales, and the results are somewhat surprising.

According to its findings, published by Fast Company, photos featuring boudoir props get fewer clicks, as do 'open-mouthed' models, but when a model touches her hair rather than puts her hand on her hip, sales can double.

Adore Me uses a marketing ploy called A/B testing, which involves shooting every set of underwear in a variety of ways - on two different models for example - and randomly serving half its online audience with one photo and half with the other.

Whichever picture invites more clicks and leads to more sales is then used going forward, and each month, underwear that hasn't sold well will be re-shot using different models, poses or themes.

According to the company, using the right model is crucial, and matters more than the price of its lingerie. 

Switching the same set of underwear to a different model can halt sales, even with a $10 discount.

Notably, Adore Me's most popular and thus most lucrative model is Brazilian beauty Simone Villas Boas, 27, who has golden brown hair, blue eyes, washboard abs, an ample bosom and puffy lips.

'No-one' with blonde hair has so far sold well, the research shows.

For its plus-size collection, A/B testing has revealed that using genuinely plus-sized models - U.S. size 12 and up by definition - works much better than using 'in-betweenies', who are in between teeny sample-sized and plus-sized.

And the ethnicity of its models bears little influence on buying patterns.

Consumer-driven: The brand also posts side-by-side shots to its Instagram account and asks its followers to state their preferences (pictured) 

'We had some super strong sellers on the African American model, and we had some super bad sellers on the African American model, it was all about the way she behaves in the picture,' says Adore Me's founder, Morgan Hermand-Waiche.

'That's what makes the beauty of the A/B testing. It doesn't cancel out an ethnicity and a genre; it's all about the emotion.'

Mr Hermand-Waiche, a self-confessed 'geek', was born in France and studied math and computer science at Ecole de Mines, before attending Harvard Business School and launching Adore Me in 2010.

His stringent testing methods are clearly working. In just four years, the company has hauled in $5.6million in revenue.
