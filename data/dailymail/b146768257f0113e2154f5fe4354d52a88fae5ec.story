Dozy thieves had to abandon their car after it broke down when they squeezed four stolen cows into it.

The crooks used a blowpipe to tranquillise the animals before loading them into their Proton Wira motor, which has folding rear seats.

One cow was placed in the boot and the other three squeezed into the rear of the car.

On the run: The crooks took flight, abandoning the car and the cows about seven miles from the farm they had stolen them from

As the three crooks fled the scene of the crime - two on motorbikes and one driving the car - in Bukit Mertajam, Malaysia, on Friday, however, the car broke down under the weight of the four beasts.

The crooks took flight, abandoning the car and the cows about seven miles from the farm they had stolen them from.

Deputy police chief Chin Soo Song said: ‘They drove away but their car broke down a short distance away, forcing them to abandon the vehicle and its booty.’

The thieves are still on the run.
