This is the first picture of the 11-year-old boy whose parents have been arrested on suspicion of neglect and child cruelty after allowing his weight to balloon to 15st.

The couple, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk were caught out when they met with social workers with the explicit intent of trying to get a wet room installed at home - but were investigated.

They claim that teachers encouraged them to contact a social worker for the state-of-the-art wet room which would have cost over £2000 as a trick to make authorities drop in.

Overweight: This is the 11-year-old boy whose parents allowed him to balloon to 15 stone - but blamed genetics

According to The Sun police stepped in after doctors raised concerns about the boy’s welfare following two visits to hospital earlier this year.

Yesterday the parents admitted that they called their obese son ‘Wee Chubby’ because of his size – but blamed genetics rather than his diet and lifestyle.

Both parents have been arrested on child cruelty charges and been bailed.

However his mum is adamant that the wet room would have made life easier for them as their son had refused to go upstairs - but it led child protection services to show up a month later.

Following a meeting with social workers this week, the couple have agreed to a letter of intent over the boy’s care outlining what they will do to help him lose weight. If they fail to stick to the terms, legal proceedings will be started to take the boy into care.

The 5ft 1in schoolboy has a body mass index of 41.8 – close to double the healthy level. According to the NHS’s online BMI calculator, the healthy weight range for his age and height is from 6st 14lb to 9st 7lb.

A social services report is said to record that he fell over during a school swimming session and was unable to stand up by himself. It also details admissions to teachers that the boy – who is supposed to be on a strict diet – had eaten takeaways and been to a milkshake parlour.

The boy’s 20st father said yesterday: ‘My son’s always been big. He was born with shovels for hands and spades for feet. Everyone on my side of the family is big.

‘There’s nothing we can do about it. I only eat occasional kebabs. Our son’s favourite snack is steamed broccoli – and he’s still big.’

The father, 49, and his unemployed wife, 43, told The Sun they try to encourage their son to play sport by giving him toy guns to fire in their garden at home.

He also plays regularly on his Nintendo Wii, a computer games console in which players depend on physical movements to control actions on the screen. The couple had signed up to a voluntary plan to tackle the boy’s weight when they were threatened with legal action earlier this year, but it brought no improvement.

Concerns were raised by teachers at the specialist school he attends for help with autism, and the parents agreed to see a social worker.

But doctors at the boy’s local hospital called police after he was twice admitted for treatment in March, and officers then visited the family’s home.

The boy’s mother, who describes herself as ‘chubby’, said the family were trying their best to help him.

‘The idea they could take away my son scares me so much,’ she said. ‘I’m nothing without my kids. His weight isn’t that much of a big deal … it’s genetics – you can be genetically fat.’

Police said it would be ‘inappropriate’ to comment on the case, but added that a child’s welfare was ‘paramount’ in such situations and that officers only intervened when ‘other attempts to protect the child have been unsuccessful’.
