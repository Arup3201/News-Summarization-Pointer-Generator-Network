Everton have revived interest in Sunderland target Ever Banega.

The Argentina international is keen to leave Valencia after struggling for a regular place in the starting line up before being sent out on loan to Newell's Old Boys last season.

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet looked to be pole position to land the 25-year-old ahead of next season.

But new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, a compatriot of Banega, is also a fan and is keen to explore a move for the £5.5million-rated midfielder.

Banega was left out of Argentina's World Cup squad and will now concentrate on securing his next move.

He was sent out on loan to Newell's Old Boys last season and is likely to be available for around £5.5million this summer.
