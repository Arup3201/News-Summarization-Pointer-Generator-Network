Denmark has finally vowed to ban sex with animals because the practice is 'damaging the country's reputation' as well as being non-consensual.

The country has become a magnet for animal sex tourists in recent years and has even seen a surge in animal brothels - as bestiality is banned almost everywhere else in Europe. 

Danish agricultural minister Dan Jorgensen said he will outlaw the act - closing the legal loophole following mounting pressure from the international community.

Ban: Danish agricultural minister Dan Jorgensen made the decision to outlaw sex with animals claiming the country's reputation was suffering as it had become a magnet for animal sex tourists

He told Danish daily Ekstra Bladet: 'I have decided that we should ban sex with animals. This is because it constitutes an attack on the animal, which naturally cannot consent to sex. 

'It is also damaging to our country's reputation to allow this practice to continue here while it is banned elsewhere.' 

A recent Gallup opinion poll revealed that 76 per cent of Danes supported a ban on animal sex. 

The bill, which also requires changes in the country's welfare animal laws, will be introduced by the Danish government in 2015. 

Speaking in a VICE documentary, Danish animal rights activist Karoline Lundstrom recently commented: 'I don't think the Danish government is doing enough to protect the animals. 

'They need to do something to protect zoophilia in Denmark.' 

Bestiality has been illegal in England since 1290 under the reign of Edward I, but many of our European neighbours including France, Germany, Belgium and Holland have only outlawed the practice in the last ten years. 

Non-consensual: The Danish politician pointed out that bestiality 'constitutes an attack' as animals are unable to offer consent

Sweden banned zoophilia, another term describing sex with animals, in April 2014 in a move backed by the country's Rural Affairs Minister, Eskil Erlandsson. 

'There should be no doubt whatsoever that bestiality is unacceptable,' The Local cited him as saying.

In 2012 the same ban was passed in Germany. 

Chancellor Angela Merkel's government introduced the new law against the practice, saying animals should not be used 'for personal sexual activities or made available to third parties for sexual activities… thereby forcing them to behave in ways that are inappropriate to their species.'

Bestiality is still legal in Finland, Hungary and Romania.
