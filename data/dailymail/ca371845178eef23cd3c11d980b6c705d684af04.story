Radamel Falcao insists that he is fully fit and ready to be a success for Manchester United despite another misfiring display against QPR.

Falcao returned to United's starting line-up on Saturday as Louis van Gaal's side ran out 2-0 winners at Loftus Road but the Colombian was not among the scorers.

He told reporters afterwards, however, 'I am fine. I feel really good. I am playing without any sort of fitness problems.

'It was a very important 90 minutes for me. I need to play and I am very happy that I did. Obviously I really hope to score soon but the opportunities will come, I am sure of that.'

Falcao joined United in a £6million loan deal from AS Monaco last summer but has struggled with injuries and form since arriving in England, netting just three goals in 14 games so far.

Against QPR, the 28-year-old failed to add to his tally although keeper Rob Green did pull off a couple of smart stops to deny him.

Manchester United are yet to make a decision on whether to make Falcao's loan deal permanent for £43m at the end of the season.
