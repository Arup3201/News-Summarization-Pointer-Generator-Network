Perhaps Geraldo Rivera should choose a quieter area for interviewing Occupy Wall Street protesters next time. Maybe he shouldn’t bother at all.

The veteran Fox News presenter was forced away from the demonstrators on Sunday as they chanted ‘Fox News lies!’ at him in Manhattan.

The 68-year-old was trying to talk to protesters when crowds recognised him and he walked away with his bodyguards to chants of ‘Goodbye!’

Geraldo Rivera: The veteran broadcaster (centre) was forced away from the demonstrators on Sunday as they chanted 'Fox News lies!' at him and his crew

First time around: Rivera was trying to talk to protesters when crowds recognised him and started chanting 'Na na na na, hey hey hey, Goodbye!'

The demonstrators were reacting to what they perceive as intense criticism from Fox News of their protest movement over the last few weeks.

Protesters tried to speak to Mr Rivera as he walked away to the sound of: ‘Nah, nah, nah, nah; hey, hey, hey; goodbye!’.

Many Republican politicians and right-wing thinkers have been critical of the protesters, with Herman Cain labelling them 'jealous’.

But the demonstrations, which are now entering their fourth week nationwide, have now spread to more than 25 cities in the U.S.

Mr Rivera is an experienced broadcaster who once interviewed Michael Jackson before his trial for child molestation charges.

Mr Rivera's team used a blog post to hit back at suggestions he was forced to walk away.

'Their chants did not send us packing,' it said. 'In fact, through the crowd's chanting, we completed the remaining two topics and five interviews. Then, 12 minutes later, having covered all the topics planned and interviewed all the guests invited on the program, coming back on camera from an edited piece on the similarities between Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox, Geraldo delivered (a) wrap to close the show.'

He joined Fox almost 10 years ago and has also covered the Afghanistan war, Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iraqi elections in Baghdad.

In November 1988 his nose was broken and his face cut during a skirmish during the taping of a programme called ‘Teen Hatemongers’.

The violence broke out during a heated talk show debate between white separatists and black civil rights campaigners.

Mr Rivera is not the first Fox News reporter to have suffered at the hands of a volatile crowd, reported Opposing Views.
