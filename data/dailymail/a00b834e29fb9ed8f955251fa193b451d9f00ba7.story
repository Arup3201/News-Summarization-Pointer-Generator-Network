David Cameron will today seek to quell unrest over ‘bribes’ for Scotland – as senior Tories insist laws giving England equivalent powers must be passed within months.

The Prime Minister has invited 20 MPs, including some of his fiercest backbench critics, to his country retreat, Chequers, to thrash out plans for ‘English votes for English laws’.

Many Conservatives say powers over tax, welfare and spending must only be ceded to Edinburgh if Scottish MPs are barred from voting on them at Westminster.

David Cameron is committed to the timetable for devolution agreed by the three main party leaders, according to a No 10 source

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, who is to stand down after last week’s No vote on independence, yesterday claimed Mr Cameron had tricked Scots voters.

But No 10 sources insisted that he was committed to the timetable for devolution agreed by the three main party leaders. ‘No ifs, no buts, that will occur,’ said one.

Plans for English votes for English laws would be unveiled at the same time, in January, but separately, the source said.

All three party leaders will face uproar from many MPs if they press ahead with powers for Scotland but not England.

Tory chief whip Michael Gove said at the weekend it would be ‘impossible’ to hand powers to Scotland without reassessing the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster. Mr Cameron said on Friday that further devolution must take place ‘in tandem with, and at the same pace’ as the dilution of Scottish MPs’ rights. The No 10 source said: ‘These issues will be considered in parallel and at the same time.’

But Mr Salmond said No voters would feel ‘tricked’. He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘The Prime Minister wants to link change in Scotland to change in England. He wants to do that because he has difficulty in carrying his backbenchers on this and they are under pressure from Ukip.’

Former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign, told the Andrew Marr programme: ‘The agreement reached by the three parties, as far as I am concerned, is non-negotiable. Anyone who welches on that will pay a very heavy price for years to come. There is a separate issue about what further constitutional change comes to the UK.’

Graham Brady, head of the 1922 committee of backbench Tories, said it was likely MPs would only approve powers for Scotland alongside a move to English votes for English laws. Mr Brady, invited to Chequers with former frontbenchers John Redwood and Bernard Jenkin, said it was a ‘basic principle of fairness and justice’.

He added: ‘We’ve already got two classes of MPs. Since the devolution settlement was first introduced 15 years ago, we’ve had Scottish MPs who have been able to vote on laws relating to England when they can’t vote on the same matters relating to their own constituencies. So there is an unfairness there that already needed rectifying; the case is even stronger as we transfer more power.’

Mr Redwood, leader of the Tory campaign for a proper English settlement, called for a Commons vote on the so-called West Lothian question before the next election.

Such a vote would put Labour MPs who disagreed on the wrong side of public opinion. He said: ‘If the other English MPs in other parties vote us down they will have to explain why.’

A No 10 source played down the idea, saying it was ‘not ruled out’ but depended on what a Cabinet committee chaired by William Hague proposed.

Sir William McKay, the former clerk of the House of Commons, considered modest restrictions to the role of Scottish MPs in a report for the Government last year. He said more powers for Scotland would mean going further, and suggested that laws only affecting England should be passed via a double majority voting system, gaining the support of a majority of English MPs as well as a majority of the Commons as a whole.
