The youngest of six British soldiers blown up by a Taliban bomb joked about his death in a final letter to his family which was read out at his funeral today.

More than 500 mourners turned out to say a tearful farewell to Private Chris Kershaw, 19, as he was laid to rest at his parish church in the village of Idle, near Bradford, West Yorkshire.

Family and friends packed the church of Holy Trinity while many more stood outside as the service was relayed over a loud speaker.

Final farewell: The Union Flag-draped coffin of Private Christopher Kershaw is carried into Holy Trinity Church in the village of Idle, West Yorkshire by his comrades at his funeral

Loved his job: Pte Kershaw,  a member of the 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, never stopped living life to the full, his mother Monica (right) said in a tribute read out at the service 

Pte Kershaw, a Warrior driver, was one of six to die when their armoured car was ripped apart by a Taliban bomb 25 miles north of Lashkar Gar in Helmand province on March 6.

Like all front-line service men and women, he had been encouraged to write a final letter home to his family in case he was killed.

Pte Kershaw wrote to his family: 'This is to inform you of the unfortunate death of, well, me. I would like to explain that even though I don’t know how I died I am sure it was from some heroic act.

'In the long run, I was doing the job I loved. This was my dream job and even though it had its ups and downs I loved every second of it.'

True hero: The 19-year-old's coffin was draped in the Union Flag with his cap, uniform belt and medal on the lid and entered the church as the Band of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards played Amazing Grace

Paying their respects: Mourners arrive for the funeral, where many stood outside the packed church as the service was relayed on a loud speaker

Chris was buried with full military honours including volleys of shots fired over his grave.

Yesterday’s service was overshadowed by a second family tragedy.

As well as burying his son, his grief-stricken father Brian was also struggling coming to terms with the loss of his mother Joan.

In his thoughts: A soldier bows his head during the funeral service

Joan Kershaw died aged 87 on Wednesday less than 24 hours before the service.

It was Joan’s husband Fred, who served with the Black Watch in World War Two, who inspired Chris to join up.

Major Malcolm Birkett, Commanding Officer of the rear area group of the third Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, said: 'It is a sad occasion.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to Brian who lost his mother yesterday.

'He is not only having to bury his son, but has lost his mother as well.

'Chris’s grandfather was in the Black Watch and told him what it took to be an infantry soldier.

'Chris sat and listened to his stories and took it to the next level by becoming a modern infantry soldier.'

A family friend said: 'Joan absolutely adored Chris and he adored her as well. She had been ill for some time and was not expected to attend the funeral because she was unwell.'

During the service, tributes were paid by Chris’s sister, Sarah-Louise Kershaw, and his mother, Monica.

Sarah-Louise said: 'Chris always was and always will be a true hero. I am so proud of my brother, my best friend, and a true Yorkshire warrior.

'Just remember Chris to look down on us and know you will live forever in our hearts. I love you so much.'

Major Birkett said: 'He loved everything about the army and aspired to be an NCO. He was like the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket.'

Monica Kershaw said in a statement read out to mourners: 'Chris was born two and a half months early. Although he had a shaky start to life, it never stopped him living it to the full.

'Chris has been taken away but will stay in my memory forever.'

An Mod spokesman said all the soldiers were encouraged to write a final letter home which was only sent to their family if they were killed.

The deaths of Pte Kershaw, Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, were the single biggest loss of British life in Afghanistan since 2006 and took the total number of British military fatalities since 2001 to more than 400.

They were killed in a catastrophic double blast when the huge bomb triggered a second explosion of ammunition inside their Warrior armoured vehicle.

This reduced the 40-ton Warrior to a 'riddled shell', meaning it was impossible for any of its occupants to survive.

It was the worst single episode for UK troops in Afghanistan since a Nimrod crash killed 14 in 2006, and the biggest-ever loss to insurgent action.
