A New York partygoer has spoken of his shock after being hit by a drone at a hi-tech 'home of the future' party.

Publisher Stephen Kosloff tweeted shocking images from the party, organised by gadget website Gizmodo, of his blood-stained t- shirt after an out of control drone hit him in the head.

The drone, which is believed to have had technical problems, hit Kosloff in the ear and forehead.

Stephen Kosloff (right) was hit by the drone at a Manhattan party showing off hi-tech toys. His encouter left him shocked and covered in blood - although he admitted he simply carried on with his night out.

'I am now the only person I know who was wounded by a #drone at a @Gizmodo party. #tech' he tweeted.

'A few folks had the drone on a table, and they fired it up again,' Kosloff told The Awl

'Next thing I know, WHAM!!!!!!! Right in my f**king head. The drone.'

'The ordeal was 'mildly upsetting; not very painful, but a big shock, ' he said.

'It knocked me pretty good.'

However, he admits the ordeal did not ruin his evening, and praised staff at the event, who helped him.

'but I'm not washing the shirt,' he tweeted.

'When people ask about the blood I can say 'I was hit in the head by a drone.''

However, he did have some advice for party planners.

'Drones make bad party toys'.

Quadcopters have become an increasingly common sight, with dozens of manufacturers producing low cost versions that can be used for everything from surveillance to walking dogs.
