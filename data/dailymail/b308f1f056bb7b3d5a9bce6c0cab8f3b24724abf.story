Victims of crime face a ‘cruel postcode lottery’ to get help under plans that have triggered a fierce row between London Mayor Boris Johnson and Ministers.

Johnson has blasted the Ministry of Justice for reforms that will hand out victim support budgets according to how many people live in each area,  not by local crime rates.

Mr Johnson’s officials believe each crime victim in the capital will get the equivalent of £24 worth of support, while those living in the countryside could get up to £166 per head. 

Mayor of London Boris Johnson has criticised proposed reforms by the Ministry of Justice which would see victim support budgets based on an area's population

In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson wrote to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling: ‘I am disappointed that the allocation has not been more intelligently crafted because there is now a real risk that funding levels will not match demand in London.’

Stephen Greenhalgh, Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime in the capital, last night added: ‘The Government needs to think again before victims of crime are victims again of  a cruel postcode lottery.’

Javed Khan, chief executive of charity Victim Support, said: ‘It is unfortunate that some areas will benefit more than others.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are making more money available than ever to help victims cope and recover from the effects  of crime.’
