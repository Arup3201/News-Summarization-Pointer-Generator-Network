Being married for less than seven years and in your forties makes you most likely to have a secret fling, according to a new report.

If you’re a fortysomething woman, live in the South East, are educated to GCSE level, earn less than £20,000 and have been married for less than seven years then you’re a classic case for an affair, the latest research shows.

Men indulging in covert affairs are more likely to be in their late forties or fifties, live in the South East, have a degree, be self-employed, earn between £20,000 to £30,000 a year and be married for less than seven years.

The latest research shows that being married for less than seven years and in your forties makes you most likely to have a secret fling

The survey investigated which ages, professions, regions, length of marriage and other lifestyle factors are most prolific in people who cheat on their partner.

For both men and women, more than half had been married for less than seven years before they thought about seeking an affair, with eight to 14 years of marriage being the second most category and the numbers steadily declining the longer a couple had been together.

Men who are self-employed are most likely to have a secret fling followed by those in executive management.

For women, the most common cheaters are among housewives, followed by secretaries.

There also seemed to be a link between affairs and how much people earn. Below £20,000 was the most common salary bracket (50 per cent for women and 29 per cent for men) and between £20,000 to £30,000 was second most common.

For women, it's their naughty forties when their eyes wander but for misbehaving men it's their fifties

For men only though, there was another spike in those who earn over £60,000.

For women, it is during their forties when their eyes wander, with 24 per cent of women looking for an affair aged between 41-45 and 21 per cent aged 46-50.

For their male counterparts 19 per cent of cheaters were aged between 46-50, 18 per cent were aged 51-55 and 16 per cent between 41-45.

The most well-behaved age category were the 18-25s.

Where you live could also dictate your secret lustiness. The South East outnumbered all the other regions by a long way (39 per cent of women and 34 per cent of men).

The Midlands was next most common for men and the South West came in second place for unfaithful women.

Ireland and Scotland were the regions with the lowest number of forbidden liaisons.

Having two children, it seems, doesn’t bode well on fidelity with 37 per cent of philandering women and 30 per cent of philandering men having two children with their established partner.

But having none at all also seems to lend itself towards forbidden trysts (30 per cent of men and 28 per cent of women embarking on affairs were child free).

According to maritalaffair.co.uk, which conducted the research, the most overwhelmingly common reason for cheating, which out beat any other category five-fold, was lack of intimacy.

While many may not openly admit so in front of their partners, a significant majority of both sexes agreed that an affair could save a marriage.
