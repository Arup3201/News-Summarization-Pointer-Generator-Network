Dangerous: Billy Joe Craven has been jailed for life after a vicious attack on a stranger, during which he punched her 30 times

A judge has described CCTV footage of a man's vicious attack on a woman as among the 'most harrowing' he has ever seen.

Billy Joe Craven, 19, punched his victim 30 times in 20 minutes, raining blows on her face and head until she was unconscious.

He pounced on his 25-year-old victim yards from her home as she returned from a New Year's party in Chapelfields, York, partially stripping and then attempting to rape her.

Handing chef Craven a life sentence at York Crown Court, Judge Stephen Ashurst, said the victim's injuries, including multiple bone fractures, were so severe that she was unrecognisable.

The attack was captured on CCTV and Judge Ashurst said: 'It is one of the most harrowing pieces of footage I have ever seen.'

He told Craven, of Chapelfields: 'The sexual violence upon her was self-evidently degrading and the brutality of the violence puts this case in my judgement into an exceptionally serious category.'

He added: 'Your disturbed personality and history of sexual misbehaviour makes you dangerous to the public.'

Alan Mitcheson, prosecuting, told the court that Craven had been out celebrating with workmates after finishing their New Year’s Eve shift.

Two colleagues had warned him about his sexual overtures to their partners, but he persisted.

He left them at 3.45am and wandered around streets near his mother’s home until he came across the woman as she arrived outside her house.

Craven only ceased the horrific attack when he heard a passer-by calling the police and ran off covered in her blood.

The passer-by gave chase but lost him in the maze of streets.

The victim, left lying on the ground, was found suffering from hypothermia 30 minutes later.

Craven later went to York Hospital, astonishingly claiming to police that he been robbed, but his only injuries were grazed knuckles.

As he brazenly gave a witness statement to officers, they arrested him because they had found his party hat and rucksack at the scene of the crime.

Mitigating, James Bourne-Arton said the attack had not been life-threatening or planned.

Craven pleaded guilty to sexual assault, attempted rape and causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Judge Ashurst jailed Craven for life with a recommendation that he not be considered for parole for at least five years and seven months and put on the sex offenders' register for life.

He was also banned from working with children.

Detective Chief Inspector Nigel Costello, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'I am satisfied with the life sentence imposed and hope that it brings some comfort to the victim.

'This was a truly vicious attack and, in my 22 years' police service, I have never seen anything more harrowing than the CCTV footage that captured the entire offence.

'The level of injuries sustained by the victim made her unrecognisable.

'Her injuries, both physically and psychologically, will require further treatment to aid her recovery.

'However, she has been extremely brave in how she continues to rebuild her personal and professional life.

'I hope the life sentence helps her to put this horrendous ordeal behind her.'

DCI Costello added: 'Billy Craven is a very dangerous individual and someone that the authorities responsible for his release will have to consider carefully as to whether he will never be a threat to the public again.

'I thank the witness in this case who had the courage to investigate what he encountered and then intervene by calling the police and giving chase to Craven as he fled the scene.'
