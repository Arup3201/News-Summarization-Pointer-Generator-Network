Older people who carry out at least 200 hours of voluntary work a year reduce their risk of high blood pressure by 40 per cent

Volunteering for the WI or helping out at a charity shop could save your life by reducing your blood pressure, according to new research.

Older people who carry out at least 200 hours of voluntary work a year  - which equates to 25 days of eight hours - reduce their risk of high blood pressure by 40 per cent.

The condition, known medically as hypertension, is one of the main causes of stroke and heart disease - Britain’s biggest killer.

A study last week found about a quarter of over 60s in the UK regularly help the Women’s Institute, the Scouts and other such organisations, more than any other age group.

The researchers believe the reason these activities improve blood pressure could be that people who devote their time to others enjoy more friendships and social connections than they would otherwise.

Professor Sheldon Sneed, of Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said: ‘As people get older, social transitions like retirement, bereavement and the departure of children from the home often leave older adults with fewer natural opportunities for social interaction.

‘Participating in volunteer activities may provide older adults with social connections they might not have otherwise. There is strong evidence that having good social connections promotes healthy ageing and reduces risk for a number of negative health outcomes.’

The study, published by the American Psychological Association’s Psychology and Aging journal, says voluntary work may be an effective way of preventing high blood pressure without the use of drugs.

Every year high blood pressure leads to more than seven million premature deaths across the globe through heart disease and stroke.

In the UK there are estimated to be about 62,000 unnecessary deaths a year from stroke and heart problems because of poor blood pressure control.

For the study 1,164 participants aged 51 to 91 from across the US were recruited and asked about any voluntary work, as well as various social and psychological factors.

At the first interview in 2006 all had normal blood pressure levels but when measured again in 2010, those who had been doing 200 hours or more a year for charity were 40 per cent less likely to have developed hypertension.

The researchers said the specific type of activity was not a factor the important thing was the amount of time spent.

Psychologist Rodlescia Sneed, who led the research, said: ‘Everyday, we are learning more about how negative lifestyle factors like poor diet and lack of exercise increase hypertension risk.

‘Here, we wanted to determine if a positive lifestyle factor like volunteer work could actually reduce disease risk.

‘And, the results give older adults an example of something that they can actively do to remain healthy and age successfully.’
