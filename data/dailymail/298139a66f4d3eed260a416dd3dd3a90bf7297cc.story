A swarm of bees caused a stir when they clustered around the nether regions of a statue in a busy city centre.

Thousands of the insects settled on the figure of Talos in the crowded centre of Cambridge.

Two police officers were sent to keep people away and a nearby restaurant closed its doors and windows as a precaution.

Filipa Goncalves, 23, who works at a nearby YO! Sushi, said the bees arrived around noon on Sunday.

She said: 'The bees were spread out all over the place. Then they started moving to the statue. The customers were a bit concerned so we closed the doors.

'I have seen lots of people taking photos. I think it has raised people’s curiosity as they have landed around the crotch. It looks like a pair of pants.'

Call the Midwife star Stephen McGann tweeted a joke about Talos’ 'bee codpiece'.

A beekeeper eventually arrived to remove the swarm.

In Greek mythology, Talos protected Crete from pirates and invaders.

The scare came two days after a swarm of bees sent shoppers fleeing from a London branch of Topshop, while another caused alarm at a shopping centre in Bournemouth.
