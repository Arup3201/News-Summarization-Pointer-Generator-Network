A karate instructor who murdered a churchgoing teenager as she babysat two young children was jailed for 25  years today.

Tony Bushby, 19, tricked promising student Catherine Wynter into going out with him by using fake Facebook friends and then stabbed her to death as she looked after her niece and nephew.

The horror unfolded on Boxing  Day last year as she babysat for her sister Sabrina who was spending  the night away from home with her boyfriend.

Tricked: Promising student Catherine Wynter was murdered whilst babysitting in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire

Her elder sister had warned Miss Wynter, 19, to ‘lock the door and not let anybody in’.

Bushby stabbed her 23 times and left her body locked in the house with the youngsters overnight.

When her mother went to check on her 
the following morning, she was told by the children, aged three and 
four, ‘Grandma, Katie’s dead.’

She followed a trail of blood and 
found her daughter lying dead on the kitchen floor at the house in 
Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in a pool of blood.

Following the murder, Bushby went to 
his family home nearby and destroyed his mobile, to cover up what had 
happened and destroy evidence.

Police visited him after examinations of Miss Wynter’s laptop and phone led them to conclude he was her boyfriend.

When detectives studied his computer, 
they found he had  set up a fictitious circle of friends on Facebook – 
all of whom  he had used to communicate with Katie, convincing her  they
were real.

The profile pages for Dan  Tress, Cyn Darwin, Shane Pleuon and Krystal Stanguard featured photographs Bushby had found online.

He was behind all the characters and 
they reflected his ‘obsessions and interests (with) all things dark and 
evil’. He even went on to blame one of his creations, Dan Tress, for 
Katie’s murder.

Bushby denied murder but was convicted by a jury at St Alban’s Crown Court on Tuesday.

Miss Wynter’s mother Joy Davis told how her world had ‘crashed around’ her following the murder of her daughter.

In a victim impact statement read to 
the court, Mrs Davis said it was ‘impossible’ to describe the 
devastation the loss of Katie had caused.

She described her daughter as ‘truly unique, one-in-a-million and irreplaceable’.

‘She had an innocence about her and it was because of  that innocence that she died,’ she said.

‘Christmas should be a peaceful happy 
time but for my family its meaning has been changed forever, and we will
never be able to celebrate in the same way.

‘I have been robbed of a future with 
my daughter.’ Mrs Davies added: ‘All the evidence shows that Bushby had 
planned to  kill Katie – why, what had she done to him?

‘What in his eyes was a game to him, grooming her, controlling her... He is evil and we will never forgive him.’

Sentencing Bushby to life with a 
minimum term of 25 years, Judge Andrew Bright QC described the murder as
‘planned and premeditated’.

He said: ‘Although there was no sexual
assault I am satisfied that your motive was a sexual one and that you 
derived sexual excitement from inflicting those injuries upon her.

‘I am satisfied you intended to kill 
her and made sure you had done so before leaving her in a pool of blood 
in the kitchen where her young charges were to find her.

‘In the months leading up to the 
murder you created fictional friends in order to gain Catherine Wynter’s
trust and to say things on Facebook designed to mislead her.’

Judge Bright added that Bushby posed a ‘very real  danger to women.’
