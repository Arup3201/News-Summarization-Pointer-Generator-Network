Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal and chief executive Ed Woodward have made Arturo Vidal their prime target after securing the signature of Angel di Maria on Tuesday.

United have denied interest in Vidal all summer but have belatedly got involved in serious talks, as they have with Ajax over utility player Daley Blind.

Van Gaal's chief reservation about the Chile star - who carries a £30million price tag - is his injury record.

Knee surgery last season prevented him playing for Juventus since the end of March, although he did he recover in time to feature for Chile at the World Cup.

The 27-year-old's dynamism would be a welcome addition to United's much-maligned midfield - as the club's misfortunes continued with a 4-0 defeat by League One outfit MK Dons in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night.

If United were to sign Vidal it would take their  spending past £150m this summer, after breaking a British transfer fee record to land Di Maria.

All smiles: United completed the signing of Angel di Maria for £60million from Real Madrid on Tuesday

The Argentina star has penned a five-year contract at the club that will net him £6.5m a year after tax after completing his £60m move from Real Madrid.

'I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester United,' said Di Maria.

'I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Spain and there were a lot of clubs interested in me, but United is the only club that I would have left Real Madrid for.

'Louis van Gaal is a fantastic coach with a proven track record of success and I am impressed by the vision and determination everyone has to get this club back to the top – where it belongs. I now just cannot wait to get started.'

Di Maria was not signed in time to travel to Milton Keynes  but is expected to make his debut at Burnley in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday.

United manager Van Gaal said: 'Angel is a world-class midfielder but most importantly he is a team player. There is no doubting his immense natural talent.

'He is a tremendously fast and incisive left-footed player who puts fear into the most accomplished defence.

'His dribbling skills and his ability to take on and beat opponents are a joy to watch. He is an excellent addition to the team.'
