Seventeen-year-old Rudy Hummel hasn't let one of the coldest winters in decades, drenching rain or clouds of mosquitoes prevent him from sleeping outside every night for a full year. What began as an experiment, however, became a mission to raise money for those without a roof above their heads.

'I’m not going to claim to have any idea 
what it’s like to be homeless, but it opened my eyes to the fact that, 
yeah homeless people are there,' Hummel told Arise News this past 
January, The Blaze reported.

Hummel was preparing yesterday to spend one last night in his treehouse at his family's home in Hermantown, near Duluth, making it 365 straight nights outside.

He endured 76 subzero nights in a snow 
cave. The Boy Scout would pitch a tent while traveling, even using a 
hotel's deck. By his count, he slept outdoors in 30 different places.

Hummel's experiment became a fundraiser 
along the way for Habitat for Humanity and the Hawk Ridge Bird 
Observatory in Duluth. He invited friends over to sleep in his yard for 
his last night and urged other people following his adventure to donate 
and join them by sleeping out wherever they are.

Winter nights weren't so bad, Hummel said, even when it got down to 27 degrees below zero one night. His cave, a hollowed out pile of snow called a quinzhee, kept the temperature about 10 degrees warmer than outside. But mostly he relied on layers — a fleece liner inside a mummy bag inside two other sleeping bags, with two or three quilts over that. He'd wear up to three layers of pants and up to seven shirts.

'The worst nights of all were actually during summer, the really hot, humid nights' that often turned stormy, he recalled. 'I would be completely drenched with my own sweat.'

Two nights were especially tough, Hummel said. One was last summer, at Woodland Caribou Provincial Park in Ontario, when he used a hammock with a mosquito net.

'There were so many mosquitoes that I couldn't get to sleep because the buzzing was so loud,' he said.

And
 there was a rainy night as the snow melted this spring. He decided his 
quinzhee was unsafe so he pitched a tent on the driveway and got soaked 
moving his gear.

'That's the only night where I've actually been cold,' he said.

'The wind would rattle the tarp around, I 
couldn't get much sleep, the tarp leaked, the rain flew in through the 
side 'cause of the wind. The thunder kept me awake,' he told NNCNOW.com.

Hummel's parents were proud of their son despite having their own concerns for his safety.

'Ugh.
 I wanna be like him. I just... he's got more together at 17 than I do 
right now really, in many ways,' said Rudy's dad, Mark Hummel.

Mark is thankful for the way his son has dedicated his life to making a difference in society.

'I like to think in general that children stand on the shoulders of 
their parents, and generation after generation we can grow and evolve as
 people and as humanity, but man he came up with a really tall ladder on
 top of my shoulders,' said Rudy's dad.

Hummel said he got the idea last April
 to spend every summer night in his treehouse. In August, he decided to 
go for a full year. In December, he turned it into a fundraiser and 
started a website with links to his two charities.

He chose Habitat 
because he could have gone inside anytime, but knew that some people 
don't have that choice. He also picked Hawk Ridge because he learned 
that the squirrels, owls and other creatures sharing his backyard 
weren't just visitors. He had raised about $4,000 as of Thursday.

Hummel
 had mixed thoughts about the end of his experiment, mainly because his 
bedroom was in 'dreadful' shape after a year of disuse.

'I
 will have to do a significant amount of cleaning before I can lay in my
 bed,' he said.

'It's amazing how much stuff accumulates in a place you 
don't use.'

His parents are 
proud, but his mother, Gail Johnejack, laughed at the suggestion that 
she might be happy to have him back safe inside.

'If he pulled this off I'm pretty confident he could pull whatever off,' she said.

Rudy plans to put his unique experience into writing.

'A scout leader in my troop has offered to help me try to put together some stories into a book, so I'll take him up on that. Maybe it won't get published but it will help me at least immortalize these memories for myself,' said Rudy.

Rudy's friends say that he has a big heart but that it continues to grow every day.

'If you compare him to the rest of us, he's the biggest giver amongst us,' said Rudy's friend, Andrew Clauson.
