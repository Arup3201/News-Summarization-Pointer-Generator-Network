England manager Roy Hodgson has described Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane as having 'come on leaps and bounds'.

Hodgson is considering naming the 21-year-old in his England squad for the first time, having taken notice of Kane's goalscoring exploits at White Hart Lane.

Kane scored two goals against Chelsea in Tottenham's 5-3 win and is being tipped to be involved in England's next game against Lithuania on March 27.

Hodgson's selection, however, could have repercussions for Gareth Southgate, the England Under-21 manager ahead of the European U21 Championship in June. 

'Harry is one of those players – Andros Townsend being another one – who didn't exactly burst on to the scene in his club side and get straight in,'  Hodgson told SiriusXM FC.

'They got loaned out first and sent out to different places to learn their trade, if you like, or at least pick up some important aspects of their trade.

'We have watched [Kane] for a while and I worked with him briefly in the Under-21s when I filled in for one game. Harry has come on in leaps and bounds and I'm not surprised because I know [former coaches] Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand very well. 

After a stunning first half of the season Kane is now in line to make the step up to the England senior side

'They have worked with him at Tottenham and they always believed in him as a goalscorer. It's tremendous to see people like him doing so well and quite strange that in the Under-21s a year or two ago we were bemoaning the fact we didn't think our forwards were up to the level of the midfielders. 

'And yet suddenly Kane, Saido Berahino and Danny Ings are all doing exceptionally well. It will be a headache for Gareth who he picks to play in the summer.'

Hodgson reserved special praise for Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin, too. 

'Charlie is doing very well,' he continued. 'He's another one who has come through the lower leagues and, a bit like Rickie Lambert, I'm sure people have watched Charlie many times and dismissed him because he doesn't run like the wind. 

'You can be a good footballer sometimes without needing to run like the wind and Harry Redknapp has brought the best out of him for QPR.'
