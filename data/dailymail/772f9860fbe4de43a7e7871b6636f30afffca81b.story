Shaun Fagan, who died while receiving treatment for pneumonia at the Harley Street Clinic in central London 

A doctor in charge of a father-of-two who died at a Harley Street clinic says a senior nurse failed to check his oxygen tube when she noticed it had slipped.

Doctor Rashid Suleman told an inquest he believed 50-year-old Shaun Fagan's life could have been saved if the nurse Lermo Lindero had properly checked his oxygen tube when she noticed it had slipped.

Mr Fagan, 50, was receiving treatment for pneumonia at the Harley Street Clinic in central London when he suffered cardiac arrest after his air supply was affected.

The independent financial advisor was starved of oxygen as staff attempted to resuscitate him, Westminster Coroner’s Court was told.

Despite managing to stabilise Mr Fagan, he suffered 'catastrophic' brain injuries and his family were forced to switch off his life support machine eight days later.

He was married to wife Sandra and had two sons.

His family slammed the care he received at the clinic and say doctors prevented them having one last conversation with him.

Sports fanatic Mr Fagan, of Mill Hill, north London, was admitted to Barnet Hospital with chest pains on September 16.

He was then transferred to the clinic with a severe lung infection two days later.

Dr Suleman also blamed the experienced nurse for errors during attempts to reinsert the tube when it became clear it was not providing an air supply.

Shortly after he gave evidence at Westminster Coroner's Court this morning, Coroner Fiona Wilcox adjourned the hearing to enable Nurse Lindero to seek legal representation.

Financial analyst Mr Fagan was starved of oxygen and suffered a cardiac arrest when his ventilator tube slipped while he was treated for pneumonia at the prestigious Harley Street Clinic on September 22 last year.

Nurse Lindero told the inquest she had noticed Mr Fagan's ventilator tube, known as an ETT, had slipped 'one to two centimetres' from his mouth when she went to assess him after seeing his heart rate drop.

But she said she did not check it was correctly in place and failed to pass the information on to Dr Suleman when he answered the emergency call after the patient went into cardiac arrest.

Dr Suleman told the hearing he received a 'brief account of events leading up to the cardiac arrest' from Nurse Lindero when he arrived in Mr Fagan's room.

Coroner Wilcox asked Dr Suleman: 'Was any mention at all made of the ETT?'

He replied: 'I was not made aware of any incidents at all regarding the ETT.'

Coroner Wilcox said: 'If Sister Lindero did have any concerns about the ETT, for example if it had moved, would you expect that information to be passed on?'

'Yes,' Doctor Suleman said, adding: 'A clear airway is first and foremost the important thing when managing a cardiac arrest.

'On initial inspection of the upper airway I found the tube was not going through the vocal chords but was disappearing out the back and into the oesophagus.

'I informed the team it was dislodged. I cut the tube and removed it and asked for an oxygen mask.'

By the time the mask was placed on Mr Fagan's face, he had been starved of oxygen for at least 15 minutes, causing him 'catastrophic' hypoxic brain injuries, the inquest heard.

Dr Suleman went on to describe how Nurse Lindero, described by the Coroner as a senior member of staff with many years' experience, then hindered his attempts to reinsert a new ETT.

He said: 'In this case, she went on to remove the bougie [a guiding aid for the air tube before I had sufficient time to advance the ETT far enough for it to be in the trachea.

'Given the importance the lack of oxygen in Mr Fagan was, I immediately removed the tube and reinserted the oxygen mask instead of wasting time looking for other ways to confirm the position.'

Mr Fagan had then been without oxygen for at least 15 minutes and Dr Suleman told the inquest it was his experience that patients would start to suffer brain injury between three and five minutes without air.

Coroner Wilcox, addressing Dr Suleman, said: 'If support had been given to Mr Fagan at about 6.31am, could his brain injury have been averted?'

'In my opinion, yes,' he said. 'Steps should have been taken to confirm whether the airway was secured or in the appropriate position.'

Coroner Wilcox then adjourned the inquest until next month to allow Nurse Lindero to seek legal representation.

Her decision to delay the hearing, which had been expected to conclude today, reduced members of Mr Fagan's family to tears in the public gallery.

The Coroner said: 'The evidence we have heard this morning has taken this inquiry in a different and unexpected direction.

'The evidence clearly suggests there was an omission by Miss Lindero that may have caused or contributed to Mr Fagan's death.

'It is properly arguable that, had she done something to rescue that compromised airway, we would not be here at all. Because of the seriousness of that I feel we have no choice but to adjourn.'

Earlier Doctor Carlos Gomez, in charge of Mr Fagan’s care, told the inquest: 'He was in severe respiratory distress, struggling to breath, move or talk.

'He was receiving oxygen through a tight-fitting mask, but we decided to put him on a ventilator to pre-empt him requiring emergency breathing assistance.'

Mr Fagan’s wife, Sandra, said she and her sons were not informed of the decision to place him on a ventilator, robbing them of their last chance to speak to him.

In a statement read to the court, she said: 'The nurses said they were putting lines in him for the antibiotics and would be about 30 minutes.

'After about an hour-and-a-half I became troubled as still no-one had come to see me. They never said anything about putting him on a ventilator.

'I was particularly upset about the complete lack of communication. It would have been better if they would have explained what they were doing and why.'

Dr Gomez said that in hindsight he 'regretted' not keeping the family informed.

He said: 'I wish Mrs Fagan had the chance to say goodbye.'

Mrs Fagan said she had serious concerns about the treatment her husband had received at the Clinic, adding: 'He was a fit and healthy man.

'He loved golf and exercising at the gym. He had a very active social life, attending charity events.

'I have lost my husband and my two sons have lost their father. I have a number of concerns about his treatment at the Harley Street Clinic.

'I don’t understand how they allowed this tube to become dislodged when he was paralysed for so long.'

Mr Fagan was given sedation drugs after he started to resist the ventilator and was pumped with five different types of antibiotics to try and fight the lung infection, the inquest heard.

But on September 22, six days after he was admitted to the Clinic, he suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after 6.35am as he lay paralysed in bed.

Data recorded on the ventilator showed Mr Fagan’s oxygen levels had plummeted in the minutes leading up to his cardiac arrest.

Coroner Fiona Wilcox asked Dr Gomez: 'Would it be fair to say this dislodging led to a lack of oxygen and then the damage to his brain and his subsequent death?

'And would it be fair to say that, but for the dislodgement, this death wouldn’t have occurred at this time?'

Dr Gomez replied: 'Yes'.

Nurse Lermo Lindero, who rushed to Mr Fagan’s room after seeing his heart rate drop on monitors at the nursing station, told the inquest: 'His heart rate slowed down to 40 from 60 or 70.

'At the time, the line was flat and there were no numbers on the screen.

'I heard a colleague say they had increased the oxygen to 100 per cent. Then I saw the ETT (oxygen tube) was one to two centimetres away from his lips.”

She added: 'The saturation probe was not in the right place. It could have been disconnected from the monitor.'

Asked if she checked the connection, Ms Lindero said: 'No'.

Asked what she did next, the nurse said: 'It did not come to my mind to do anything because it happened quickly.

'I told my colleague to perform CPR and put out the call. People arrived in less than two minutes.'

Claire Fazan, of Leigh Day Solicitors representing the family, said: 'The inquest being on the anniversary of the events in question has obviously been very distressing for the family.

'As you can imagine they are enormously distressed that they now have to wait even longer for answers. Beyond that, they have no comment to make.'
