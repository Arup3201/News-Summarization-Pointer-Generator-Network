'Outrage industry': Comedian Rowan Atkinson blamed the law for creating a society of an 'extraordinarily authoritarian and controlling nature'

Ministers agreed to scrap a law 
outlawing ‘insulting words or behaviour’ last night after a campaign led
 by comedian Rowan Atkinson.

Home Secretary Theresa May announced a dramatic U-turn yesterday saying the government would ditch the contentious words from the Public Order Act amid fears that they are strangling free speech.

The Blackadder and Mr Bean star led a coalition of campaign groups complaining that the legislation has been abused by over-zealous police and prosecutors to arrest Christian preachers, critics of Scientology, gay rights campaigners and even students making jokes.

The government caved in yesterday after suffering a humiliating defeat in the House of Lords before Christmas.

Mrs
 May told the Commons that the word ‘insulting’ would be removed from 
Section 5 of the Public Order Act, as part of the Crime and Courts Bill.

She
 told MPs: ‘Looking at past cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions 
could not identify any where the behaviour leading to a conviction could
 not be described as “abusive” as well as “insulting”. 

'He
 has stated that the word “insulting” could safely be removed without 
the risk of undermining the ability of the CPS to bring prosecutions.

‘We
 will issue guidance to the police on the range of powers that remain 
available to them to deploy in the kind of situations I described, but 
the word “insulting” shall be removed from Section 5.’ 

The climbdown was welcomed by civil liberties campaigners.

Tory MP David Davis said: ‘I welcome this sensible decision by the Home Secretary. The only effect of this law was to chill public debate and depress freedom of speech.’

Reform Section 5 campaign director 
Simon Calvert said he was “very pleased” by the Government’s statement, 
adding: ‘This is a victory for free speech. People of all shades of 
opinion have suffered at the hands of Section 5.’ 

Nick
 Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, 
said: ‘It should not be the police’s role to intervene when someone 
feels they have been insulted and the Home Secretary and her Coalition 
colleagues should be applauded for accepting this important change.’ 

Comedian
 Rowan Atkinson blamed the law, introduced in 1986, for creating an 
‘outrage industry’ and a society of an ‘extraordinarily authoritarian 
and controlling nature’.

The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted the most egregious abuses of the old law.

A sixteen-year-old boy was arrested under the legislation for peacefully holding a placard that read ‘Scientology is a dangerous cult’, on the grounds that it might insult followers of the religious movement.

In 2005, an Oxford student was arrested for saying to a policeman: ‘Excuse me, do you realise your horse is gay?’. 

Thames Valley Police said the arrest had taken place because he had made ‘homophobic comments that were deemed offensive to people passing by’.

Gay rights campaigners from the group Outrage! were also arrested under the Act when they protested against supporters of the Islamist fundamentalist group, Hizb ut-Tahrir, which was calling for the killing of gays, Jews and unchaste women.

In a victory for the Mail, the Bill also contains a commitment to shake-up Britain’s lopsided extradition laws.

The legislation says there will be a so-called ‘forum bar ‘which means more suspects are likely to face trial in the UK - rather than be packed off to America.

A hearing will take place before a judge to examine the details of any offence which the Americans want to end in extradition.

If prosecution is possible in both the UK and abroad, the courts will have the power to bar prosecution overseas. This will be done of it is ‘in the interests of justice’.

Supporters believe that - if the ‘forum bar’ had already been in place - Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon could have been spared his decade-long fight against extradition. He was only saved, in October last year, after the Mail’s lengthy Affront to British Justice campaign.
