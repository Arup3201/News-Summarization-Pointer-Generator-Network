A spokesman for the Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has denied reports that a number of detainees jumped off a roof in a suicide attempt on Christmas Island earlier this week.

He said there was no basis to the claim, and apart from that the government does not comment on reports of individual acts of self-harm.

'The minister is advised reports of multiple suicide attempts by women on Christmas Island are not correct,' the spokesman said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments were also echoed by the Immigration department, who said 'It would be highly irresponsible and dangerous to allow government policy to be determined on the basis of such threats.'

Sri Lankan asylum seekers prepare to enter the magistrate's court in the southern port district of Galle on Tuesday

The 41 refugees face court after being handed back to their country by Australia when a boat was intercepted off Cocos Island in late June - although their government declared they would not risk persecution if returned

Earlier in the week Tony Abbott said the Australian government would not be subjected to 'moral blackmail' when it comes to assessing who is given asylum in Australia following reports nine mothers on Christmas Island attempted suicide in the hope their children would by allowed to stay.

The latest claims come as the government finally admitted in the High Court that they had intercepted a ship carrying 153 Sri Lankan asylum seekers in the Indian Ocean outside Australian territorial waters.

On Thursday, a report in The Australian defined the apparent suicide attempts as 'minor acts of self harm' in an attempt to be transferred to the Australian mainland.

In relation to the same incident, according to The Daily Telegraph asylum seekers returning to Sri Lanka had their iPhones, credit cards and digital cameras siezed by Australian authorities.

At the detention centre on Christmas Island, reports have emerged of at least nine Sri Lankan mothers attempting to take their own lives in the past week once told by immigration officials that they would never resettle in Australia due to arriving before July 19, 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Maurice Blackburn lawyer Jacob Varghese, who represents 72 asylum seeker babies, said the women were in a ‘state of utter despair’ about the welfare of their children.

Mr Abbott said he had not seen the report, but added: "If true, it is a harrowing tale".

However, he said the government would not capitulate to 'moral blackmail' when it came to border protection.

'This is not going to be a government which has our policy driven by people who are attempting to hold us over a moral barrel - we won't be driven by that,' he told the Nine Network on Wednesday.

'No Australian government should be subjected to the spectacle of people saying "Unless you accept us, I am going to commit self harm".'

The Sri Lankan group was charged for attempting to leave the country illegally with 27 granted bail and five remanded in custody while nine children were discharged

Meanwhile, up to one dozen Sri Lankan mothers have attempted suicide on Christmas Island in the hope that their then orphaned children would get to reside in Australia

Officials told the High Court that a boat carrying the refugees had been intercepted last week. They are still on the customs vessel in the Indian Ocean outside Australian territorial waters while their fate is decided.

The government promised to give three days' notice before attempting to return the group, which includes about 40 children, some as young as two.

Meanwhile, 41 asylum seekers who were handed back to Sri Lanka by Australia appeared in court to face charges of attempting to leave the country illegally. Five remained in custody while 27 were granted bail. Nine children were discharged.

The group had been intercepted off Cocos Island in late June and their government declared they would not risk persecution if returned.

Late on Monday, the High Court granted an urgent temporary injunction preventing the return of the 153 to Sri Lanka ahead of Tuesday's hearing in Melbourne, where Commonwealth Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson undertook to give 72 hours' notice before moving them.

Refugee rights activist Ian Rintoul said the decision will come as an ‘enormous relief’ to the asylum seekers.

‘It is only a temporary fix, but it's blown a bit of a hole in the government's treatment of asylum seekers,’ he said.

The government had previously declined to reveal any details about the boat, citing its longstanding policy not to comment about on-water operations.

But Mr Gleeson told the High Court on Tuesday Australian authorities had intercepted the boat 12 miles from Australian territorial waters which meant their future would be determined by the Maritime Powers Act, not the Migration Act.

The matter will return to court within 21 days for a directions hearing.

There are also 153 Sri Lankan asylum seekers held onboard the Australian customs vessel in the Indian Ocean since being intercepted in the last week

The fate of the Sri Lankan asylum seekers held at sea would not be decided for a least another three weeks
