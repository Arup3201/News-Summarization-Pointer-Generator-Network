The TrekDesk fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work

We’re often told that walking 10,000 steps a day will help keep us trim and stave off diseases such as heart disease and cancer.

But with today’s hectic pace of life it can be difficult to find the time.

Now an American company has come up with what it claims is the solution – exercise while you work.

TrekDesk, as it is known, is a desk that fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work.

The manufacturer claims the height-adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health, reduce stress, prevent disease and strengthen muscles.

Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours.

Incredibly, it also claims to boost mood and productivity – although it remains hard to fathom how productive typing while walking would be. 

A statement on the company’s website says: ‘In fact, many studies have shown that your concentration and productivity will increase walking with a treadmill desk.

'You will notice immediately that you do not suffer from the daily bouts of fatigue that may plague you after lunch and later in the day. Increased blood flow to the brain also keeps you sharp and attentive.’

Despite the possible difficulty of such multi-tasking, it adds: ‘There is a  distinction between a workout at work involving slow movement with a TrekDesk Treadmill desk and what people normally associate with exercise at a gym.’

The desk, which costs £300, is designed to fit over any treadmill and measures 72x34inches. It also features a manuscript holder, allowing you to read books, magazines or manuscripts while you type, talk and walk.

There are even two cup holders in case you work up a sweat – but the manufacturer maintains the level of exercise isn’t vigorous enough to cause sweating. 

Research published last month found that lounging in a chair for too long can double the risk of diabetes, heart disease and death.

The findings indicated that sitting is bad in itself, irrespective of other time spent exercising or playing sport.

Professor Stuart Biddle, from the University of Loughborough, who was one of the researchers, said office staff should take a stand for health by refusing to sit down at meetings and moving their work station to the nearest filing cabinet.

The study, published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, analysed research data on people with different levels of sedentary behaviour.Compared with the least sedentary, those who spent the most time sitting down had a 112 per cent greater risk of diabetes.

Similarly, the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes was increased by 147 per cent in the most sedentary, and death linked to heart disease by 90 per cent.

However one of the problems many of us face is the lack of time to exercise, said Steve Bordley, CEO of TrekDesk Treadmill Desk.

‘TrekDesk was designed specifically for individuals whose employment or daily schedules confine them to a desk all day. Study after study has confirmed that staying in motion will increase health and productivity, it is not a surprise that more physical activity would also increase levels of life satisfaction as well.’
