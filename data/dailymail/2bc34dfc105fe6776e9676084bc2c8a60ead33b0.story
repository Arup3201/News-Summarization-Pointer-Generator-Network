Lingerie has always been a popular Christmas gift for a man to give his girlfriend or wife.

But that doesn't mean he ever gets it right.

Over £100m-worth of 'lingerie let-downs' lie gathering dust under beds and in the bottom of drawers thanks to bad choices made by men when it comes to purchasing underwear gifts for the women in their lives, according to new research.

You're pants: Men splash out an average of £42 per underwear set for their wives or girlfriends, but one in five women never wear them

The nationwide study reveled that two-thirds of British women have received lingerie as a present from their partner, with men splashing 
out an average of £42 per set. Yet, one in five women have never worn 
the gift, and 23 percent said they’d worn it only once.

1. Crotchless knickers - 58%

2. Leather PVC knickers - 58%

3. Edible underwear - 44%

4. Fishnets - 42%

The poll of 1,600 British women by designer lingerie destination Fox & Rose also found that the underwear women most dread receiving are crotchless underpants, followed by leather lingerie and edible smalls.

Amanda Lorenzani, co-founder of Fox & Rose said: 'For many men, 
lingerie is a confusing and intimidating world, but it's crucial they 
make the right choices if they want smiles rather than slaps on 
Christmas day.

'Men should ask themselves, is my partner a fashion 
trendsetter or a classic dresser? What's her personality type - wild and
dominating or demure and dainty? And of course, the all important 
sneaky peak in her lingerie draw to find out her correct size!'

The study also showed that older doesn’t necessarily mean wiser when it comes to lingerie - 40 per cent of 
women aged 45 to 54 have never worn their gift of lingerie, double the national average.

A helping hand: To help men choose lingerie gifts that really hit the spot, Fox & 
Rose has launched its free Gentlemen's Lingerie Lifelines advice site

Regionally, women from Edinburgh are most satisfied with their lingerie gifts, 
with all respondents in the Scottish city having worn their lingerie at least 
once.

Perhaps this is because women in Edinburgh are showered with the 
most expensive lingerie - £55 on average.

Rose has launched its free Gentlemen's Lingerie Lifelines advice site, 
offering tips on everything from size and style to a glossary of 
lingerie terms.

Ms Lorenzani continued: 'Fifty Shades of Grey has certainly generated 
demand for more adventurous lingerie sets, but the line between sexy and
sordid is very fine.

'Every woman wants to feel great about herself and
receiving the right lingerie set can do that. Men need to be asking 
themselves just a few simple questions to ensure their partner feels 
like Brigitte Bardot as opposed to Jenna Jameson in their lingerie 
gift.'

The poll also asked women which types of lingerie styles they most 
dreaded receiving, with crotch- less knickers (60%), Leather/PVC (58%), 
Edible (44%) and fishnets (42%) ranked as the most unpopular gifts.

A brouhaha over bras: Play it safe and choose something your partner is likely to wear

1 Know her sizeCheck her underwear drawer to get the right sizes. It's sneaky but works wonders. Look at the labels to find out what bra size and knicker size she wears. If that's not possible and she has protected all her clothing with deadlocks, choose a beautiful silk robe.2 Be taste sensitiveThis will bring you serious brownie points. What style of knicker does she normally wear? Does she like little thongs, short style knickers or a classic lace knicker? If she's not a fan of red suspenders, don't try and tempt her out of her comfort zone. If she is feminine, go for one of the stunning nude or pale lingerie sets and show her you pay attention. If she's a seductress opt for a more sultry look in classic black. At Fox & Rose we've made this easier for you. Just Shop By Fox if she is a vamp or Shop By Rose if she is elegantly feminine. And don't forget most women are both!3 Make it specialDesigner lingerie is a treat. We find that men either veer towards safe options or opt for ill-fitting and (usually) unwanted crotchless knickers! Most women enjoy receiving beautiful underwear they wouldn’t necessarily buy themselves. Be bold, go for something versatile and different. Try a flowing yet sexy negligee (often referred to as a babydoll dress) paired with a minimal thong for a luxuriously sensual look, for example.  If you're stuck, opt for the Fox & Rose ethos and buy her something bold and edgy as well as something classic and feminine and cover both looks.

4 Stay on trendVintage
is classic, yet sexy. Go for a vintage inspired look with high waisted 
knickers or corset style bra to accentuate your lover's assets. Or opt 
for a limited edition print. Some labels such as Stella McCartney 
Lingerie, La Perla and Ell & Cee are fashion-inspired and you'll 
demonstrate some serious style knowledge if you manage to channel this 
season's key trends into her designer lingerie collection. Damaris is an
excellent choice for a truly special gift, whereas Mimi Holliday never 
fails to delight and Maison Close is perfect for a sensuous touch.

5 Be practicalAsk for help - whether you're buying on or offline. You can email one of our designer lingerie gurus at Fox & Rose if you have any questions. Most retailers enjoy helping out their male customers so don't feel embarrassed: they are there to help you pick the perfect gift! And don' forget to opt for the gift wrapping…stunning packaging is essential and you won't have the chore of making it look beautiful either.
