A video shows the moment little Emmett Perrin mistakes a razor for a comb and giggles as he shaves all his hair off - and amazingly his mom seems to find the whole episode hilarious.

Chanda Campbell came across her son carrying out the DIY haircut when she heard laughing coming from the bathroom at the family's home in Saskatchewan, Canada.

And while many mothers would have been horrified to see their child rapidly losing all their hair, Chanda takes a more lighthearted approach to her son's mistake.

Chanda Campbell came across her son Emmett carrying out the DIY haircut when she heard laughing coming from the bathroom at the family's home in Saskatchewan, Canada

'Tell the camera what you're doing,' she says to Emmett.

'I'm combing my hair,' the little boy replies, giggling.

Chanda starts laughing as she responds: 'Doesn't look like you're combing it, it looks like you're shaving it there bud.

'I don't think you're going to be able to comb it for a while there dude.' 

'Looks good, I like it,' she adds, as Emmett displays his half-shaved head to the camera, before telling him he's done 'a fantastic job'.

The cute video, which Chanda posted on her Facebook page, has already been viewed more than five million times, and has even been sent into the Ellen Show.

The mom said that Emmett did in the end finish the haircut with a little help from his dad.

'It's only hair it will grow back,' she added. 'Little cold for no hair but by the time I got in the bathroom there was no turning back.'

Speaking to CBC News, Chanda explained that since Emmett wasn't hurting himself she decided to let him carry on with the haircut. 

'We thought we'd just enjoy a fun moment in our life,' she said.

The mom added: '(Emmett's) quite the character. He's a very busy four year-old. He's usually quite the comedian most of the time. He's always got lots of funny one-line things that he says, and he's a pretty smart kid for his age.'
