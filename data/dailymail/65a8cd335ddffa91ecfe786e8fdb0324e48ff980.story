V. Stiviano made her television debut in an interview with Barbara Walters, now she'll pour her heart out to Dr Phil - therapist to the stars.

In preview clips of an interview set to air on Wednesday's episode of Dr Phil, Stiviano talks about loving her new-found fame and how she rollerblades to deal with stress.

Papparazzi have been hounding Stiviano ever since tapes she recorded were released in which Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling can be heard making racist statements.

Loving the limelight: V. Stiviano talks about relishing her new-found fame and how she rollerblades to deal with stress in a taped interview set to air on Wednesday's episode of Dr Phil

Acting crazy: In preview clips of the interview, Dr Phil calls out Stiviano's strange behavior - including wearing her now-signature visor while rollerblading  

The scandal led the NBA to ban 80-year-old Sterling from the league for life and turned Stiviano, 31, into an overnight celebrity.

When asked by Dr Phil if she likes being in the spotlight, Stiviano responds: 'Absolutely!'

'Are you kidding me? I get to experience first-hand what it is to be a celebrity in LA,' she says. 'I have to think about what I'm going to wear, how I'm going to do my hair.'

But Dr Phil calls out some of her behavior as attention-seeking, especially wearing her now-signature visors (which he calls a welders' hat) while rollerblading.

Attention seeker: On the day Sterling was banned from the NBA for making racist statements in private conversations Stiviano recorded, his much younger girlfriend was pictured out rollerblading and wearing an unusual visor for 'privacy'

On Tuesday Stiviano left her apartment and headed to pray at Our Lady Of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles

Fortunately for other drivers on the road she took off her roller skates before getting behind the wheel

She even ditched her massive visor - if not her name plate hat

She has plenty of cars to choose from and today went for her subdued black Bentley

'We all have different ways of coping, we all have different ways of dealing with issues,' a defensive Stiviano shoots back. 'Some of us drink, some of us exercise, some of us rollerblade. You live in Hollywood, you deal with Hollywood - so you tell me how should I have acted?'

In a press release about the interview, a show spokesman promises that Stiviano will answer questions about the 'specific nature' of her relationship with Sterling and why she recorded their private conversations.

'Stiviano speaks to her criminal history; the many names she's gone by over the years and the reasons why; her specific job description and title, and is nearly brought to tears when Dr Phil asks her if she is in love with Donald Sterling,' the release reads.

When asked why she agreed to the interview, Stiviano said: 'I think you're the best. I'm here to clear the air, to tell the truth'.

Dr Phil has been itching to interview Stiviano, and talked about wanting to speak with both her and Sterling in an Access Hollywood segment earlier this month.

'She's been wearing what looks like a welders' helmet - I'm not sure what that is. Maybe she's an arc welder by trade? I don't know. I'm confused about the whole thing,' he said on the show.

The interview is set to air Wednesday at 3pm and comes just after the NBA formally moved to vote Sterling out of the league.

When the tapes were first released, NBA commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league for life, hit him with a maximum fine of $2.5million and asked the board of governors to remove him as owner. 

Force to sell: When the tapes were first released, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, hit him with a fine and asked the board of governors to remove him from his team. The league announced Monday that a vote will be held on June 3 to decide Sterling's fate

In a Monday announcement, the league said they would hold a vote on June 3 to determine whether Sterling will keep his team or not. If three-quarters of team owners agree, Sterling can be forced to sell the Clippers.

Also on Monday, police were called to Stiviano's home after an attempted break-in.

Stiviano wasn't at home at the time of the 11:30am incident, but her brother and sister were and reported that robbers broke glass on one of the front windows and tried to open a second window before being scared off.

However, authorities weren't called to the residence until 2:50pm - several hours later.
