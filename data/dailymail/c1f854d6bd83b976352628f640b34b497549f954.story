The sister of Charles Manson murder victim Sharon Tate has described her elder sibling's killers as 'little creeps, nothing special' as she pledged to fight for the rest of her life to make sure they remain behind bars.

Debra Tate was just 16 when her sister Sharon, the actress wife of Roman Polanski, who was eight and a half months pregnant, was slaughtered by Manson and his 'family' on August 8, 1969.

Three of Tate's friends - Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger and Wojciech Frykowski - were also brutally stabbed to death at her Beverly Hills home while the murderers wrote 'DEATH TO PIGS' in their victims' blood on the walls in the hope of starting a race war that Manson named 'Helter Skelter'.

Sharon Tate was eight-and-a-half-months pregnant when she was stabbed to death by Charles Manson and his followers at her Beverly Hills home. Her sister Debra described her killers in a recent interview as 'nothing special and little creeps'

Debra Tate, sister of slain actress Sharon Tate, reacts after convicted mass murderer Charles Manson was denied parole at his 12th parole hearing for the 1969 Tate-Labianca murders on April 11, 2012

Stephen Parent was a fifth victim that night - he had driven to the property to see caretaker William Garreston and had stayed on for a beer at the guest house. He was shot multiple times when he wound down the window at the electric gate as he left. 

In a new interview with People, Debra Tate, now 61, relived the moment 45 years ago that her family found out Sharon had been brutally murdered, saying: 'It made me what I am.'

Debra is known as an outspoken advocate for victims' rights as she and her family continue to attend every parole hearing to keep the Manson family behind bars. 

Manson, now 79, was denied parole for the 12th time in 2012. None of those convicted has ever been paroled and one of the killers, Susan Atkins, died in prison last year after being denied compassionate release when she was terminally ill with cancer.

Debra, who recently released a new photo-book of her sister called, Sharon Tate: Recollection, scorned the mythology that has built up around the Manson family. 

She said: 'They're not supernatural, they're not the devil, they're nothing special, they're just little creeps.'

Debra described the life-changing moment that she found her 26-year-old sister, who was fast becoming a Hollywood 'It' girl following her role in Valley Of The Dolls two years earlier, had been killed.

She told People magazine that her mother was eating coffee cake with a neighbor while her younger sister Patti, 11, watched cartoons. Debra had been taking a shower when her mother wrenched open the door and collapsed in front of her as she said that Sharon was dead.

Ms Tate, who lived in Riverside, California and has a daughter, said that her sister's murder changed her family forever. 

Her mother Doris fell into years of depression only able to rouse herself when it came to parole hearings to keep her eldest daughter's killers behind bars.

Debra's father, a 23-year Army veteran Colonel Paul Tate grieved in silence - working on the case but never speaking with his family about their terrible tragedy and barring them from attending the Manson trials.

Earlier this month, one of the women who killed for Manson has given her first on-camera interview about why she felt compelled to murder innocent people.

Patricia Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence in the California Institution for Women, says she took part in the cult killings because she was a 'coward' and 'wanted to feel loved'.

Krenwinkel was convicted along with Manson and two other female followers, Susan Denise Atkins, and Leslie van Houten, in seven murders.

She admitted during her trial that she chased down and stabbed heiress Abigail Folger at the Tate home and participated in the stabbing deaths of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the following night. 

Another defendant, Charles 'Tex' Watson was convicted in a separate trial.

All were sentenced to death but their sentences were commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme Court briefly outlawed the death penalty in 1972. 

Krenwinkel has had parole denied several times.
