Morgan Freeman has been revealed as the latest Hollywood A-lister to drop $1million to President Obama's re-election effort, weeks after The Dark Knight Rises star caused a stir with remarks about the president's racial background.

The Oscar-winning actor's big donation to Priorities USA Action, the 'super' political action committee backing the president, was announced on Thursday and will be reported in the group's federal disclosures on Friday.

Freeman's donation came after controversial remarks about Obama's heritage the actor made to NPR earlier this month, where he said the U.S. is still yet to have its first black president.

Freeman said during the July 5 interview: 'First thing that pops into my head regarding our president is that all of the people who are setting up this barrier...they just conveniently forget that Barack had a mama, and she was white - very white American, Kansas, middle of America.'

'There was no argument about who he is or what he is. America's first Black president hasn't arisen yet. 'He is not America's first Black president - he's America's first mixed-race president.'

The context of Freeman's comments 
were meant as a wider criticism of Donald Trump and his fellow birthers 
and were meant to attack Republicans and the presidents opponents.

Freeman told NPR: 'He is being purposely, purposely thwarted by the Republican Party who
started out at the beginning of his tenure saying, "We are going to do 
whatever is necessary to make sure that he's only going to serve one 
term."

'That means they will not cooperate with him on anything. So to say he's ineffective is a misappropriation of the facts.'

For Obama, whose mother Ann Dunham, a
white woman from Kansas, married his father, the Kenyan native Barack 
Obama Sr., the question of his racial identity has been a lifelong 
struggle.

Before he was
president, Obama was a community activist in Chicago and always 
self-identified as African-American, and wears the mantle of America's 
first black president with pride.

Despite identifying himself as 
African American, Obama's struggles with his identity are well
known and his memoir Dreams From My Father followed his journey to discover his Kenyan roots 
and how he came to feel more of a black man than a white man.

During the 2010 U.S. Census, the president did not check multiple boxes
on his form, or even elaborate on his racial heritage.

He ticked the box that said, 'Black, African Am., or Negro'.

Priorities USA has raised $20.4million this election cycle but lags far behind Restore Our Future, the Super PAC supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Restore Our Future has so far reported raising $81.5million.

Super PACs are allowed to raise and spend unlimited funds. Operating outside of official efforts of campaigns and national parties, they have taken over much of the dirty work of negative ads.

With four months to go before the 
November 6 general election, each side is on track to spend more than $1billion on campaigning and ads.

Last
month both Super PACs had their best month of fundraising yet. 
Priorities raised $6.1million and Restore pulled in $20million.

Overall, Obama's official campaign has raised more money than what Romney has raked in for his campaign.

But the Republican has made inroads with Wall Street and the business community, which have grown disenchanted with Obama's policies.

Hollywood and the entertainment industry remain among the biggest groups supporting Obama.

'President Obama has done a remarkable job in historically difficult circumstances,' Freeman, 75, said in a statement.

The
statement went on: 'In return, he is the target of hundreds of millions
of dollars from right-wing sources. I am proud to lend my voice - and 
support - to those who defend him.'

While Obama is under fire for the flagging U.S. economy and stubbornly high joblessness, Priorities USA has spent much of its cash on ads skewering Romney for his role at private equity firm Bain Capital.

One of the first Hollywood celebrities to give to Priorities USA was comedian Bill Maher, whose $1 million contribution in February became controversial because of his politically charged jokes and comments.

Priorities has also received $2million from Hollywood producer and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, and $100,000 each from film director Steven Spielberg and comedian Chelsea Handler.

Freeman is in the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises, opening in theaters on Friday. It is his third appearance as Bruce Wayne's mentor Lucius Fox.

He also played the president of the United States in the comet disaster flick Deep Impact.
