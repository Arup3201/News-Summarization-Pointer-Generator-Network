The record profits driven by huge iPhone 6 sales have fed a £120billion cash pile, but like fellow giants Amazon, Google and eBay, Apple faces accusations over its tax bills in the U.S. 

Record profits, driven by the phenomenal sale of the latest iPhone 6, saw Apple amass the cash pile which is larger than the total market value of Disney, Pepsi or Amazon.

The news has reignited anger about the activities of Apple and other multi-national companies which stand accused of using complex schemes to minimise their tax bills.

Record: The record profits driven by huge iPhone 6 sales have fed a £120billion cash pile, but like fellow giants Amazon, Google and eBay, Apple faces accusations over its tax bills in the U.S.

The hugely wealthy company has faced allegations in the United States that it has been able to avoid paying its fair share of tax to any government in the world for at least five years.

Similar charges have been made against other American tech giants including Amazon, Google, Facebook and eBay.

Apple yesterday revealed that its profits for just the past three months of 2014 were $18billion (£11.9billion). That figure put it ahead of the record set by the multi-national oil giant ExxonMobil in 2012, which was being carried along on the tide of a surge in global oil prices at the time.

In Apple’s case, its success has been built on sales of latest iPhone 6 and 6plus, which has a larger screen.

Staggered: Apple's chief executive Tim Cook and his staff can hardly believe their own success

It sold a record 74.5 million iPhones in the three months before Christmas, which drove the company’s revenues up by 30 per cent to $74.6 billion (£49.2 billion).

Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook, said they were ‘staggered’ by the success of the iPhone 6, which had achieved far higher sales than it or City experts had expected.

The net effect is that Apple, which is the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $650 billion (£428.5 billion) has so much money that it does not know what to do with it.

The company uses a network of companies around the world, including an off-shoot in Ireland, to minimise its tax bill in the U.S. and the many countries in which it sells its devices.

The European Commission is so concerned that it has launched an investigation into a deal between Apple and the Irish government that ran from 1991-2007, which effectively allowed the U.S. giant to shrink its tax bill.

If the inquiry finds the arrangement amounted to ‘illegal state aid’, Apple could be required to hand over billions to make up for the tax shortfall.

The huge popularity of Apple’s products and its alleged manipulation of the tax system to its legal limits means it has been able to amass a huge cash fund, estimated at $178 billion (£120bn).

If added together, the combined value of Tesco, Barclays and Vodafone only just surpass that of Apple’s cash reserves.

The cash mountain alone is equivalent to the entire annual economic output of oil-rich Kuwait and around three times more than countries such as Croatia, Uruguay and Bulgaria.

Mr Cook and his executives are apparently reluctant to return the cash to the parent company in the United States where it would be hit with a corporate tax rate of 35 per cent.

Consequently, Apple has been reduced to borrowing against this huge fund to raise cash to buy back shares in the company from shareholders at a premium price.

Murray Worthy, tax campaign manager for the charity ActionAid, said it was time for the tech giant to come clean on its finances and tax payments.

Global: Customers this week in the first Apple store to open in the capital of China's Zhejiang Province

‘The announcement by Apple today of the biggest profits in history is only part of the story. Despite this news, corporate secrecy means we still don’t know whether they’re paying a fair share of tax,’ he told Channel 4 News.

The Apple chief executive has rejected allegations of financial chicanery. Mr Cook told a US Senate committee in 2013: ‘We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar.

‘We not only comply with the laws, but we comply with the spirit of the laws. We don’t depend on tax gimmicks. We don’t stash money on some Caribbean island.’

Announcing the profit bonanza yesterday, Mr Cook said: ‘We’d like to thank our customers for an incredible quarter, which saw demand for Apple products soar to an all-time high.’

Apple has been doing particularly well among the burgeoning middle classes in China, where it is now the country’s number one smartphone brand. Research firm Canalys estimates that Apple sold more smartphones in China during the last quarter than any other country, including America.

The success of the iPhone 6 and 6 plus, which were launched last autumn, have to some extent cannibalised sales of its other devices. As a result, sales of iPads were down by 22 per cent to 21.4 million.

Devoted: Customers queued for the iPhone six outside stores all over the world, including this one in Sydney

Some experts have suggested that the launch of the new iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 and the lowering of the original iPad mini price to under £200 could see a return to growth for the Apple tablet.

At the same time, the company is pinning expectations on the launch of its Apple Watch, which is due to go on sale in April.

The watch carries a raft of sensors which means it is as much an electronic health centre and automated fitness guru as an accessory to its smartphone.

Tech industry analysts an investment bank JP Morgan suggested Apple is sitting on a raft of new gadgets that are expected to give even more fizz to its stellar sales.

Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ‘One of the main drivers for the success was the company’s increasing exposure to the Chinese market, while there were also strong contributions from Singapore and Brazil.’

Figures that'll make you dizzy

12bn 

is the profit Apple made in the past three months of 2014 — that’s £129,347,826 every day, or £5,389,492 every hour, or nearly £1,500 per second.

18 seconds

is the time it takes Apple to earn the average annual wage of a full-time UK worker: £26,500.

8.5 years 

is how long it would take for Tesco (which made £1.4 billion profit last year) to make as much as Apple made in just three months, mainly thanks to the iPhone 6.

600m 

iPhones sold since the smartphone’s launch in 2007. 36% of all the iPhones sold in the last quarter were bought in China — 24 per cent in the U.S.

1bn

devices that run the Apple iOS operating system — including iPhones, iPad tablet computers and iPods — were sold over the past seven years. That’s 391,389 units per day. 16,307 every hour, or 4.5 units every second.

75m

iPhones sold in the last quarter alone. £78.93 the price of one share in Apple at midday yesterday.

£420bn 

is the total value of Apple’s shares — more than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of all but the world’s richest 20 countries. It ranks just below Switzerland (£451 billion), and is £17 billion bigger than Argentina.

£120bn

is the total cash reserve — literally, ‘money in the bank’ — held by Apple. Nearly three times the cash reserves held by the United Kingdom.

Impressive: At £420billion, the value of Apple's shares is more than the GDP of all but the 20 richest nations

£30bn

1%

is the effective rate Apple paid in tax on its profits in the UK last year. It is estimated the company had £10.5 billion of sales here, yet the firm’s arrangements meant it had to declare just £100 million revenue, and a mere £59 million profit. As a result, it paid just £11.8 million tax.

444

Apple stores in 16 countries — 263 are in the United States and 38 are in Britain. Brazil has just one.

£250m

is the value of the shares he owns and another £140 million worth are earmarked for him under an incentive plan.
