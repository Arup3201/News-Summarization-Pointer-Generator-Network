Slipping through his grasp: Was the feather to blame for Andy Murray's defeat to Novak Djokovic in today's final of the Australian Open?

Down it came like a voodoo omen, floating from the skies like malevolent thistledown, the tiny white feather that actually did bring the thistle down.

When Andy Murray stopped playing to move a feather that drifted onto court, millions of fans back at home shuddered in horror.

BBC tennis commentator Andrew Castle thought it was a good omen – he's obviously never seen The Birds.

However, seasoned Andy-watchers all knew what that ominous bit of feather dusting meant and it wasn't that Tippi Hedren was about to get pecked to death by crows.

It meant that Murray's concentration had cracked open, like a fault-line coursing through a granite dam. It meant that once more, the end was nigh for the pride of Scotland as the runner-up spot beckoned.

For when things start going badly for Murray, there is something in the psychological disposition of the world's number three tennis player that makes him blame something else, rather than his own performance.

It is a coping strategy, sometimes a desperate one. Hecklers, sore feet, bad line calls, the man in the Melbourne crowd with the wobble board (I'm not joking) singing Rolf Harris songs or an innocent feather? Feather! That'll do it! 

Murray picked up the offending fluff with a housekeeper's zeal and it turned out to be his moment of doom.

Even watching on television thousands of miles away, we could feel the momentum shift as the power inexorably moved across court from Murray to iron-man Djokovic. And stay there.  

Consider the evidence. Murray misses first serve, picks up feather, carries on to serve his third double-fault of the match and everything goes downhill from then on.

Flapping somewhere out there on the Melbourne winds, a slightly balding pigeon has a lot to answer for.

Pain barrier: British tennis star Andy Murray was hindered by severe blisters, which needed treatment

Yet to be honest, after four hours of intense tennis in the Australian Open final, Murray's unravelling was kind of a relief.

Andrew Castle kept going on (and on) about how he is convinced that Andy Murray really should be world number one, but I'm not sure that we Scots could cope with that; we are pre-programmed to cheer on the national underdog. It is what we do best.

We can deal perfectly with sporting defeats. We've had decades of practice at that game. It is the hope, the terrible hope of victory, which is so crushing. And this is only the first of the grand slams in what is meant to be Andy's year – how on earth will we survive? 

After some big wins last year, Murray has been playing and behaving more like a champion; managing to deal with the pressure and expectations of others in a graceful way.

He's even shaved off that dreadful gingery furze on his face, so it's a love-all from me. Yet he still has his moments and watching him play can be a sweet kind of torture, especially when his confident, early promise gives way to a gradual erosion of temper and he starts getting a bit, well…. Scottish.

Under the power of the flying, silver-shoed Serb with the bear hair, our Andy got his disgruntled grunt on – and promptly lost.

When things start going badly, he does his tell-tale snarly face, lowers his head like a wounded stag, starts limping about as though someone had put tin-tacks in his trainers.

One minute he is spinning glorious aces over the net and looking untouchable, the next he is his own bad ass; doing the fist pump, turning the air blue, doing that snuggle-toothed grimace that suggests there should be a claymore in his hand, not a tennis racquet.

After the match he blamed his hamstrings, he blamed the feather, he blamed hecklers, he blamed his blisters. However, in the latter instance, we certainly shared his pain.

Earlier in the match, television viewers were rewarded with a horrendous close-up of the naked Murray foot when a physio applied some court-side first-aid.

We saw Murray's battered chipolata toes encased in their individual pods of bandage, all bound up like a ballerina's.

His livid skin looked pink and flayed as yellow iodine was painted onto his raw and weeping blisters. If that didn't put you off your Sunday morning bacon and eggs, nothing could.

The torture just kept on coming. The terrible squeak-squeak-squeaking of the players' trainers as they played on the blue Plexicushion surface. The oofy grunts when they hit a big shot. Andrew Castle saying 'unbelievable' every five seconds.

In the end, the BBC's main man concluded: 'Djokovic would literally walk through a brick wall to win this title.'

For her part, presenter Sue Barker thought that Andy's 'spirit had been broken'. More like his blisters, darling. But never mind.

There is always the next tournament. Come back and be unbelievable, Andy. That's all we ask.
