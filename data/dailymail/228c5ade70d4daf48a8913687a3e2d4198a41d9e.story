The self-styled ‘captain’ of a replica German U-boat could face prison after he admitted swindling the taxman out of more than £1million.

Captain Birdseye lookalike Richard Williams, 56, spent £50,000 kitting out the vessel, which he named U-8047, with naval artefacts, a periscope and dummy torpedoes.

His vessel was moored as a floating visitor attraction at Clarence Dock in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when it was raided by Customs officers.

Now, the self-confessed maritime history enthusiast - who has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain in his boat - is facing prison after admitting to avoiding more than £1million in taxes.

An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs dating back to 2012 found Williams and his former partner Laurel Howarth had set up a number of companies in Lancashire.

They ostensibly sold disability equipment to care homes and the NHS, but evidence gathered by investigators showed minimal genuine sales actually took place.

Despite this, the pair filed false tax returns and invoices for more than £1million.

Both Williams, of Blackpool, Lancashire, and Howarth, 28, formerly of the same address, hijacked the identities of friends and associates in an attempt to hide the fraud.

Williams, also known as Stephen Howarth, was charged under the naval title and a series of other aliases he is claimed to have used - after the raid on his self-made barge in January 2012.

In May 2011, Williams spoke to the Mail while touring around the Liverpool waterways dressed in full German submarine commander regalia.

He told reporters he was a former mobility scooter salesman and had spent more than £50,000 building the U-boat.

He also revealed that the boat had been subject to attack from passers-by who thought that he was a Nazi.

Sandra Smith, assistant director of criminal investigation at HMRC, said: ‘Their attempts to extort money from the public purse were brazen and the pair went to great lengths to try and cover their tracks.’

The pair appeared at Manchester Crown Court yesterday having admitted to several charges of fraud.

Williams pleaded guilty to three counts of cheating the public revenue and one of having an article used for fraud. Howarth has pleaded guilty to three counts of furnishing false returns.

They spoke only to confirm their names before the case was adjourned until April in order for reports to be prepared.
