When Dobby the corn snake disappeared without a trace last year devastated 10-year-old Max Gerrard frantically tried to hunt down his beloved foot long pet.

Having finally given up hope of finding the reptile though the youngster and his family moved home shortly afterwards, making way for new homeowners.

But as the somewhat startled new family stumbled across it in the garage one year on it was not so hard to spot - as it had grown to a whopping four foot.

Slithering surprise: Max Gerrard has been reunited with his beloved snake Dobby after new householders discovered the reptile lurking in his old home in Northumberland

Max’s dad, Mark, a 44-year-old firefighter, got a call from the shocked new owners of his home last week.

He said: 'Max was heartbroken when he lost him and it was horrible at the time.

'He was upset for weeks and people kept saying he might turn up, but he never did and we subsequently moved house.

'But I had a call from the owners of our old house saying they had found him in the garage - not surprisingly they were a little alarmed.'

Two-year-old Dobby was just over a foot-long when he disappeared from the home in Ulgham, Northumberland, and it is thought the thin snake hunted mice to survive over the course of the year and hid in small crevices, unnoticed.

But when the new homeowners Stephen and Adria Robinson found him hiding in the garage last week he was substantially bigger.

Adria said: 'I got a phone call from my husband to say ‘we have a problem’ and he told me he’d found a snake in the garage.

Corn snakes like this one can grow to around six foot in length and are usually found in North America

'He was all right about it actually and I think I was more shocked than him.

'He got it wrapped round a stick and put it in a bucket.'

Grateful Max has since paid a visit to Stephen and Adria to thank them for reuniting him with Dobby and he gave them a card, a bottle of wine and some sweets for the couple’s two-year-old son Daniel.

Max said: 'I was absolutely shocked that we had found him because he had been gone for so long.

'I was really devastated that I lost him and I’m not going to let him go missing again.'

Max, who lives with parents Mark and Amanda, siblings Alex, 11, and seven-year-old twins Ruby and Emma, is now enjoying introducing Dobby to his other snake, George, which he bought after Dobby’s disappearance.

Andrew Douglas, part-owner of Dragons Den Exotic Pets in nearby Morpeth, where Max bought his pet, said corn snakes were placid creatures and not to be feared.

He said: 'Corn snakes are an American species and with living in a house it’s  probably a similar climate to what they would get in America. They wouldn’t survive outside in this country.

'Because they are so thin, they are able to get through a lot of small holes and crevices and you would be quite surprised what food they would be able to find around the house.

'When corn snakes are young they feed on pinkie mice but as they get bigger they start on larger mice so it’s safe to say Dobby was probably doing a bit of pest control while he was missing.'
