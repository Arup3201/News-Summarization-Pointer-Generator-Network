While the drinking age in the United States is 21-years-old a new baby bottle designed to look like beer will have kids drinking at 21 months-or even younger.

Freds Chill, Baby Lil Lager isn't filled with actual beer but it will make 10 ounces of juice or milk look a whole lot more illegal.

According to Food Beast, the $12 bottle is actually fit for a baby because it's BPA free.

Chug! Chug!: This baby bottle designed to look like beer is a real head turner that may get mom and baby kicked out of the playground 

The novelty item is made with phthalate-free plastic and a food-grade silicone nipple and brave parents can order it online from the website Fredandfriends.com.

'Double-takes are guaranteed when Junior is chugging his favorite beverage from Fred's CHILL, BABY Li'l Lager baby bottle. No, it's not beer, it's just good old baby formula served up in a BPA-free, phthalate-free plastic bottle with a food-grade silicone nipple. Cheers! Li'l Lager holds 10 fluid ounces and is easily disassembled for cleaning,' says the site of its controversial child item.

The website says Fred is a Rhode Island-based team of designers with partners around the globe, ‘all focused on well-designed stuff that solves a problem, puts a smile on your face, and doesn't cost a fortune.’

Most of the fans on the Freds and Friends website thought the item were humored but others thought it may be a bit inappropriate or dangerous.

‘ER countdown,’ wrote Joe Markovic on Facebook.

Hopefully the only time Lil' Lager drinking babies will be  in the ER is when its their delivery.

Sparking discussion: Some of the Facebook fans of Fred and Friends thought the gimmick was delightful while others thought the babies may end up in an ER someday
