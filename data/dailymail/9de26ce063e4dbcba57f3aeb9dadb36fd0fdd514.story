Not since the great Seve Ballesteros was in his heyday has a Spaniard descended on Wentworth with quite as much going for him as the remarkable Miguel Angel Jimenez at the BMW PGA Championship this week.

Who would dare argue now that 50 is not the new 30 after a month in which Jimenez appears to have lived out the ultimate middle-aged male fantasy?

Let’s see: played at Augusta National and finished in the top four at the Masters; met up with his old mates on the Champions Tour and won his first event; came back home and got married to a woman half his age; played in his home Open and became the first golfer over the age of 50 to win on the European Tour.

How’s that for a bucket list rattled off in the space of just 35 days?

50 years young: Miguel Angel Jimenez is in prodigious form coming into this week's PGA Championship

27th time lucky: Jimenez was a popular winner of the Spanish Open at Catalunya Resort

As Jose Maria Olazabal said to him on the eve of the final round at Augusta: ‘You know how much I admired Seve, how much I learned from him, how he was my hero. Look at me. Today my hero is you.’

It’s not just Olazabal. There’s not a golfer at the European Tour’s flagship event who couldn’t learn from him. The gym rats could learn you can be the fittest golfer in the world but it’s not much use if you’re not fit for golf. The strung-out obsessives could learn the value of a relaxing glass of wine and the importance of remembering that playing the game for a living remains an enormous privilege.

Those who only play well on certain courses could learn from the man who always begins every event with the odds stacked heavily against him but doesn’t know the meaning of the word ‘can’t’.

Defying convention: The Spanish veteran takes his fun attitude towards life onto the course, and it works

And those 
who place too much importance on appearance money, well they could learn
 about loyalty from the man who kept his own European Tour event alive 
with his own money as the Spanish economy hurtled towards oblivion; a 
player who’d cut off his ponytail before he’d turn his back on the 
European Masters in Switzerland because of how well they’ve treated him 
over the years; who’s given up millions in senior golf earnings to 
pursue his dream of becoming the oldest European to compete in the Ryder
 Cup.

Sunday’s
 fabulous feel-good victory at the Spanish Open - he won it for the 
first time at the 27th attempt - showed just why he is right to believe.
 He might be one spot outside the automatic placings but right now he is
 the only player with two victories to his name in full-field events 
during the qualifying process. And the Ryder Cup is all about winners.

How does he do it, with his funky swing, portly physique and the fact he gets outdriven by 40 yards on most holes? It has become perhaps the most oft-asked question in golf.

No-one ever supplied a better answer than former Open champion Tom Lehman. ‘He plays the game the way we all want to play. He has fun,’ said the former US Ryder Cup captain. ‘That’s the key to a long career. A big part of why Miguel is still so good is he carries over his philosophy of living to his game.’

And so it is that the middle-aged males, that most ubiquitous of golfing species in Britain, will arrive at Wentworth in their thousands this week with a little extra jaunt to their stride. They thought it was something when their hero won the PGA at the age of 44. They marvelled when he came back from breaking his leg in a skiing accident to finish fourth last year at 49.

Now here he is again, still the man making everything seem possible.

Once it was Seve who captured their imagination for being the man they all wished they could be. Now it is Jimenez, the man they all wished they had become.

Fire in the belly: Jimenez shows frustration at a tee shot at Augusta this year, where he finished fourth

Among the willing youngsters carrying mobile scoreboards with each group at the PGA this week is Annabel Dimmock, who has a big event of her own looming on the horizon.

At just 17, the Wentworth teenager has been selected to represent Britain and Ireland in the Curtis Cup in Missouri next month, thus becoming one of its youngest ever participants.

‘Watching the top men close up, I’m hoping to pick up some playing and tactical hints,’ says Annabel.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘We can’t wait to play at Wentworth and get the PGA crowd rocking. We’re all big golf fans, so it’s a gig we’re all looking forward to.’

Who could have imagined a member of The Who saying that? Did rock get old or golf become young? Anyway, Kenney Jones, who took over on drums when Keith Moon died, will lead his own band featuring former members of Bad Company, Procol Harum and Foreigner - if you’re under 30, ask your parents - in a free concert for PGA ticketholders on Saturday.
