Steven Gerrard claimed England’s Young Lions are ready to take the World Cup by storm ahead of Saturday’s final warm-up game against Honduras.

The England captain will lead his team out against the 33rd-ranked team in the world in 32-degree heat at the Sun Life Stadium before they head to Brazil.

Hodgson will meet Honduras officials and the match referee to discuss a drinks break midway through each half as a precaution against the heat here.

Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling, who is suspended from Saturday’s game but is in Roy Hodgson’s thoughts for next Saturday’s opener against Italy in Manaus, have all settled into the squad.

Ready for action: Gerrard believes every player in Roy Hodgson's squad is capable of starting against Italy

Gerrard, who will win his 111th cap, said: ‘The biggest compliment I can give them is that they are ready to play. They’ve brought their form from their club sides into the England set-up and that’s what I’ve noticed.

‘Hopefully they can continue that into the World Cup itself. There are two players pushing in every position to get into the starting XI and not much between them in every position.

‘The manager could pick five teams for the Italy game and you wouldn’t see a big difference in the standard. That’s what gives me hope.’

Sterling, who was the best player in an open training session on Friday, misses out today after his dismissal in the 2-2 draw with Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium.

Hodgson said: ‘As you can imagine, Raheem was absolutely gutted to be sent off, as were we.

‘It was an over-exuberant challenge and a slightly reckless act. It was his desire to help us out of a difficult situation, using his incredible pace to reach Antonio Valencia.

‘I was impressed with Valencia’s comments afterwards.

‘The referee was entitled to send him off, so it was strong of Valencia to do what he did.’Hodgson initially intended to play Sterling in the final friendly against Honduras before the squad travel to Brazil.

And England’s head coach made it clear that he has been so impressed with the Liverpool forward that he could face Cesare Prandelli’s team in Manaus on June 14 in the opening group game.

Italy haven’t won in seven games and drew 1-1 with Luxembourg, the 120th-ranked team, in their final officially recognised friendly in Perugia.

Hodgson added: ‘Be careful going down that route. I’ve worked in Italy. I know the Italian mentality and their players.

‘They have a much healthier attitude to warm-up and friendly games, and the importance they attach to them. It doesn’t bother them. The actual team won’t be bothered.’

Hodgson is also continuing to monitor Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s injury to his medial knee ligaments as the squad prepare to travel to Brazil.

England’s manager will wait until 24 hours before their opening game, as per FIFA rules, to decide whether to keep him with the squad.

Hodgson added: ‘I don’t think it’s a gamble at all. At the moment we have 23 men: three goalkeepers and 20 outfield players.

‘He was chosen for a reason. He fits in our balance. I don’t think anyone we choose to replace him will give us anything additional to the squad. We’re very anxious to keep him here. I’ll have to listen to the doctors and see what he’s likely to miss and when he’s likely to be fit, but I won’t be dashing out because he might not be fit for the first game.

‘We’d want people like him around. I’m neither confident nor lacking in confidence.

‘I’m waiting to see what happens. I’m not a doctor. I’ll be accepting with what the doctors tell me. A decision will be made. They’ll tell me their prognosis and then we’ll make a decision.’

England face Honduras in almost unbearable heat on Saturday afternoon in Miami and they will head for their base camp in Rio de Janeiro straight after today’s game.

Gerrard is thriving in his role as captain and revealed pointedly  yesterday that former England manager Fabio Capello did not believe in his leadership skills.

‘Capello didn’t believe in me as his No 1 captain,’ the Liverpool  midfielder said.

‘He did believe in me as a player, he rated me as a player and our relationship was fine.

‘At the time we picked the captain, he had Rio Ferdinand and John Terry and he thought they offered something different for him.’
