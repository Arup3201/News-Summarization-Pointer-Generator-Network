Missing: Margaret Holt is described by her family as a seasoned hiker

The family of a British pensioner who vanished on a hiking trip in Lanzarote over Christmas believe she may have fallen from a coastal path.

Active Margaret Holt, 65, from the Wirral, was last seen on the Canary Island on December 23, as she left her hotel to go for a hike.

Her worried family contacted the Spanish Civil Guard to raise the alarm after she failed to make contact with them over Christmas.

It is believed Ms Holt, who is described as seasoned hiker who would often trek 20 miles a day, was holidaying alone when she went for a walk from her hotel in the Costa Teguise.

Posters and searches along rugged coastal paths have failed to turn up any information on Ms Holt.

Authorities say she was spotted later in the afternoon in the northerly Órzola region of the island but has not been seen since.

Wendy Banks, Mrs Holt's daughter-in-law, wrote on a Facebook page appealing for information about her whereabouts: 'She is a very fit woman who thinks nothing of walking 20 miles per day. She loves coastal paths.

'We have her passport, cards from her room so know she only intended to go for a walk.

'Her mobile phone is with her but not working. We really believe she had a fall walking.'

On Lanzarote Information, an English website covering the island, a desperate appeal was made for any information on Ms Holt’s whereabouts after authorities said she may have hitched a lift with a local.

The website states: ‘Margaret is a walker and thinks nothing of covering 20 miles in a day.

‘It is believed that she may have had a fall so we need people to look off the beaten path for her. She was carrying a mobile but that has been dead since she was discovered to be missing. She likes to walk along coastal paths.'

Locals from the island stepped up the search as information emerged Ms Holt was spotted just outside Órzola between 6 and 7pm but didn’t get the last bus from the region.

She was last seen wearing a light pink vest, khaki shorts, walking sandals and a drawstring bag.

A Spanish Civil Guard spokesperson said: 'We know that Margaret was seen at 16:50 in the area of the Jameos
del Agua and Cueva de los Verdes where she is believed to have walked 
from the direction of Yi Maguez.

'She was then later spotted just 
outside Srzola between 6 and 7pm and we know that she didn't get on the last
bus from Srzola at 18:10.

'It is highly likely that Margaret 
would have thumbed for a lift, which is commonplace on the island, most 
locals will stop to give others a ride especially between these more 
remote villages.'

A search and rescue operation is due to resume today.

The Foreign Office confirmed it had been informed about the disappearance.

'The Spanish authorities are carrying out a search coordinated by the Civil Guard and local emergency services,' said a FCO spokesman.

'Staff from the British Consulate are in contact with the authorities and the family.'
