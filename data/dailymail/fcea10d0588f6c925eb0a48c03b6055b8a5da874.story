American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken has announced that he is running for Congress in his home state of North Carolina.

The openly gay father-turned-politician launched his campaign today by releasing an emotionally-charged video where he detailed his mother's domestic abuse and his criticisms of the Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, who currently holds the seat.

The entertainer talked about his work as a special education teacher, UNICEF representative and member of President Bush's commission on education.

Opening up: The former singer announced his congressional candidacy in a video that was filmed at a family friends house where he and his mother lived when he was a toddler after she escaped his abusive father

'For most Americans, there are no golden tickets- at least not like the kind you see on TV,' he says to the camera.

'More families are struggling today than at any time in our history, and here in North Carolina, we've suffered more than our share of pain.'

Aiken said he examined the district's makeup for more than a year and has assembled a veteran Democratic political team.

Aiken announced in 2008 that he is gay and has a 5-year-old son who was conceived through in-vitro fertilization with an older female friend.

He said in an interview with the Associated Press that he doesn't believe his sexual orientation will play a role in whether or not people vote for him.

'There are dozens of issues that are important to the people living in the district, and that is not one of them,' he said.

In the launch video, he cited Ellmer's votes in favor of military spending cuts and the federal shutdown as being harmful for the country, as well as North Carolina's 2nd District.

'I'm not a politician. I don't ever want to be one. But I do want to help bring back- at least to my corner of North Carolina- the idea that someone can go to Washington to represent all the people, whether they voted for you or not,' he said in the video.

For Aiken, a Democrat, winning in the Republican-leaning District will be a challenge: Mitt Romney won 58 per cent of the vote in the district in 2012, according to a North Carolina Chamber analysis.

John Davis, a longtime political researcher in North Carolina, said Aiken stands a decent chance to win the primary, but the district boundaries drawn by Republicans will make it difficult for any Democrat to win in November- particularly given his sexuality.

'It's not going to be an issue that people are going to talk openly about,' Davis said.

His opponent dismissed his candidacy today by taking a swipe at his singing career.

'Apparently his performing career isnâ€™t going so well and heâ€™s bored,' Mrs Ellmers told a radio station Wednesday.

Earlier reports that came out shortly after the rumors about his campaign began reported that he had sought the counsel of Betsy Conti, a veteran Democratic consultant.

He has long-harboured political aspirations, and though they were originally just childhood dreams he has been becoming more politically active in recent years.

In 2012 he told the Charlotte Observer that he had a secret desire to become North Carolina's governor.

'When I was in eighth grade, we had to do a project where we interviewed somebody we admired and wrote a paper about them,' he said. 'Everybody did a parent or their youth pastor or someone close to them. I called (then-U.S. Senator) Terry Sanfordâ€™s office in Raleigh and went and interviewed (him).'

In July, he made an appearance on Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to get tougher on anti-gay bullying.

'I was picked on, I was called gay, I was called fag, I was called sissy, you name it,' he said during a congressional briefing.

'Fortunately, I was able to overcome it and live through it because of a number of friends who were supportive of me.'
