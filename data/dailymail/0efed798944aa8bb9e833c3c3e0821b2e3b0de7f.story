I was at Craven Cottage on Saturday for Felix Magath’s first home game in charge of Fulham, but he took a beating and learned a lesson from Jose Mourinho.

It’s Oscars weekend – and no I’m not talking about the Brazilian Chelsea man. So these are the footballing Oscars from Chelsea’s 3-1 win at Fulham.

The Jekyll and Hyde Award….

Andrea Schurrle. A performance so bad it made me want to cry in the first half, he was awful. He couldn’t kick the ball properly.

Just before half time Ramires was in acres of space 40 yards out with time to pick a pass. Schurrle was waving like a crazed windmill on the left unmarked, Ramires looked at him, and couldn’t bring himself to pass to the useless German.

Game of two halves: Chelsea's Andre Schurrle was ineffective in the first-half but then scored a hat-trick as the Blues ran out 3-1 winners in the west London derby at Fulham

Off the pace: Schurrle couldn't get into the game before half-time and here is muscled off the ball by Fulham's Dan Burn

Changed man: But after the interval, Schurrle was unplayable, scoring three times as Chelsea went four points clear at the top

After listening to Mourinho’s expletives at half time, Schurrle turned into a very good professional footballer. His movement was excellent, his finishing even better. He bagged a hat-trick, his second of the season after scoring three for Germany in a qualifier in Sweden.

His goals at Craven Cottage were his first in a Chelsea shirt in nearly three months.

The Real Player of the Season Award….

Should go to Eden Hazard. If you want to just count up goal totals then give it to Luis Suarez. But if you love football then Hazard is the only winner.

Wizardry: Eden Hazard was Chelsea's stand-out performer and should be named player of the season

For the purists: Hazard should win the accolade for the manner in which he controls games from midfield

Hazard was quiet first half but then ran the game after the break. His vision and execution were perfect. Fulham were totally bamboozled by this genius.

Eden Hazard? More like Eden Wizard.

Massive Understatement Award…

Fulham Chairman Shahid Khan said before the game that appointing a third manager this season might be considered “unconventional or unpopular.”

No, really? He justified it by saying he had to do it to prevent a “non-stop slide in the table.”

Well he’s certainly done that. Fulham are bottom and can’t slide any further down the table.

Fooling nobody: Fulham owner Shahid Khan is onto his third manager of the season but the club's fortunes have still not improved

The Ineffective Mind Games Award…

Felix Magath. He said before the game that Chelsea have “the mentality of champions.” Was that designed to undermine the opponents? Make them feel over-confident or even complacent?

Well it didn’t work. Chelsea didn’t even bother turning up for the first-half yet still made Fulham look like a Championship side, which is probably what they’ll be next season.

Message to Magath – don’t mess around trying to play mind games with Mourinho. Pointless.

Psychological warfare: Fulham manager Felix Magath tried the mind games to try and unsettle Chelsea before the match... but his ploy failed miserably

Mulling it over: Magath troops off looking dejected after the 3-1 defeat, which left Fulham firmly rooted to the bottom of the table

The Ineffective Mind Games Bonus Award…

To Jose Mourinho who refused to acknowledge after the game that Chelsea are top of the table. They’re not only top, they’re four points clear. He’s normally so adept at the football psycho stuff, but nobody is fooled by this one, poor effort Jose.

All in the mind: Nobody is fooled by Mourinho's claims that Chelsea are not genuine Premier League title contenders

Sitting pretty: Chelsea opened up a four-point lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League following the win

The Stupid Hard man Award…

Brede Hangeland. Determined to head a ball away he went in full force, no nonsense, and smashed his temple into the top of team-mate Kieron Richardson’s head. Ouch.

Remarkably the Norwegian tried to carry on. But couldn’t. Obviously. It was daft to even think he could carry on.

A bonus “bottler” award for Fernando Torres during this incident. The Spaniard saw the Richardson/Hangeland sandwich coming and bottled out of it in good time - wise move.

Groggy: Brede Hangeland collided with teammate Kieron Richardson and had to go off with concussion

The World Cup Hopes Fading Fast Award…

Goes jointly to Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole. Bizarrely Jose Mourinho claimed this week that both “deserve” a place in Roy Hodgson’s squad for Brazil. Er…why?

Just because they’ve both played over 100 times for England? I don’t think so. Much respect to both of course, but it’s not a jolly. Roy has to balance building for the future with putting on a respectable show this summer.

I’m sorry but for Frank and Ashley that means no trip for them in my opinion. Mourinho put both of them on the bench at Fulham, and they stayed there for the full 90 minutes.

Benched: Ashley Cole was an unused substitute at Craven Cottage as his chances of going to the World Cup fade further

Waning influence: Frank Lampard was also kept on the bench at Fulham

The Premier League Title Award…

Goes to Chelsea. Or at least, it could do. I tipped Chelsea pre-season and I see no reason to change that. I’ve seen them play terribly this season – I was at the Britannia Stadium to watch them beaten 3-2  by Stoke.

But it seems that when they’ve learned a lot from that kind of result. They were so bad in the first-half at Fulham but still ended up winning comfortably.

Mourinho keeps insisting they can’t win the title, but he won’t mind being wrong on this one – if Chelsea are crowned champions he can heap praise on his players, and they will love him even more. Meantime Mourinho’s ego will privately soak up all the praise that will inevitably head his way.

Bound for glory: Chelsea are clear favourites to win a fourth Premier League title now

Jose has one massive advantage over Pellegrini and Rodgers (forget Wenger. Seriously, forget Wenger. Do I need to explain why?) – he knows how to win the title in England, he knows how to finish the job.

I can’t see it happening but if another manager finishes above Mourinho come the end of this season then they’ve done a brilliant job.
