Brendan Rodgers has landed his second signing of the
summer after Bayer Leverkusen confirmed that midfielder Emre Can is heading for
Anfield.

Sportsmail revealed how Liverpool had activated a
£9.75million (12m euro) escape clause in Can's Leverkusen contract by faxing a bid to
the Bundesliga club in the past 24 hours.

Leverkusen have now admitted Liverpool have made their
move and that everything has been agreed for the transfer to go through.

Close: Liverpool are set to sign Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can after activating his release clause

Signal of intent: Manager Brendan Rodgers has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year

Sealed: Rickie Lambert has already secured a £4m move from Southampton this close season

'Up until yesterday, I would have said it was just
rumours about Emre,' Leverkusen's chief executive Michael Schade told German
paper Bild.  'But now I can confirm that we have received an official
offer from Liverpool, and I expect a very quick conclusion to it.'

Brendan
 Rodgers has been chasing the Germany Under 21 international for a while
 and has been over to personally check on the player's progress.

The 20-year-old is an energetic box-to-box midfielder and should provide the Reds with extra impetus in the middle of the park.

Inter Milan were also keen on Can but it was always his intention to move to the Premier League.

The club hope to have a deal concluded within the week as they press ahead with plans for an assault on the Premier League title.

The player's agent, Reza Fazeli, is a familiar face around Anfield after brokering a loan move with the club for Nuri Sahin in 2012.

Rodgers is keen to get his transfer business done early. Rickie Lambert has already signed for £4million from Southampton ahead of the World Cup and they continue to pursue England midfielder Adam Lallana.

They came within a slip of winning the league last month and the belief is that if they can keep hold of Luis Suarez - who was linked with a move to Real Madrid in the Spanish press on Wednesday morning - and supplement that with shrewd additions, they'll be in a better position to challenge come August.

Can is one of the most versatile young players in the Bundesliga.

Having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at Bayern Munich, the Frankfurt-born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age.

After only four first-team appearances at Bayern, though, Can's star faded during the 2012/13 season, and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to Leverkusen.

It has done him a world of good, and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club. He has also represented Germany at every level from Under 15 to Under 21.

Can prefers to play in central midfield - 'either attacking or defending, I don't care either way' - but has been employed as a centre-back and a left-back on various occasions.

As captain of the German Under 17s team, he was the calming influence at the heart of play. His physical strength is of particular use going forward, though he is rarely overly reckless.

It has been remarked on several occasions that Can seems to have a maturity beyond his years, and his technical ability as a playmaker, either from the back or the front, is now beyond doubt.

The most commonly drawn comparison is Bastian Schweinsteiger. And not only because the young Can puts as much effort into his hairstye as Schweinsteiger once did.

His ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield, his dangerous shot, and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established Bayern star.

For those watching his marauding runs through the centre at Leverkusen this season though, Toni Kroos has always also sprung to mind.

It is little surprise that these two Bayern stars have had an influence on Can's play. He has trained with them, or at least in close proximity to them, for several of his formative years.
