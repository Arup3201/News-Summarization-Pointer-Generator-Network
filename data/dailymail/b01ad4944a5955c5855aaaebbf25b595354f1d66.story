Thug: Toby Hayden, 28, avoided a prison sentence after beating his ex-lover Loretta Butterworth last year and has been spared jailed again after attacking his new girlfriend

A thug who was spared jail after inflicting horrific injuries on his girlfriend during a drunken rage has walked free from court again after attacking his new partner.

Serial offender Toby Hayden, 28, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, sparked outrage last year when he escaped with just a community order after leaving his ex-lover Loretta Butterworth, 22, covered in blood following a vicious beating.

Just 12 months on from the first attack, the labourer has been hauled in front of the same court again after assaulting his current girlfriend Amy Weaver, 27 - but was only given unpaid work.

Both times the labourer was serving a 
sentence for a previous offence, but on each occasion, the court decided
 not to hand him a custodial sentence.

Loretta Butterworth, 24, said it was 'disgusting' her ex-boyfriend Toby Hayden had been let off with another fine.

She
 said: 'I think it's disgusting that he's assaulted four people, myself,
 two police officers and his current girlfriend, and been given another 
fine that he won't be able to pay off.'

In Febraury 2013, Hayden turned violent because he could not withdraw money from a cash machine in Bath, Somerset.

As a result, he repeatedly battered Miss Butterworth in the face.

The
 brutal assault only ended when a mother and daughter heard her
screaming 'please help me' as Hayden held her with one hand and hit her 
with the other.

Last March, a
 hearing was told Hayden had consumer several shots of tequila, at least
 eight pints and three cans of lager during the evening.

The
 court also heard that when police arrived to arrest him, he spat in the
 face of one officer and tried to gouge the eyes of another.

He
 was serving a suspended sentence for a previous violent offence at the 
time of the attack - but still walked free from Chippenham Magistrates' 
Court.

Last week, he was hauled back before the same court and admitted assault - but avoided jail again with a another community order of 50 hours of unpaid work.

The sentencing hearing was informed that Hayden had been subject to a hate campaign, with numerous Facebook pages set up about him, and fellow convicts threatening him.

Magistrates were told handing him more unpaid work would be 'setting him up to fail'.

But chairman Jonathan Chappell said: 'I am sure probation will do what they can to find you suitable work.'

Hayden hit the headlines last March when pictures of his violent attack on Miss Butterworth emerged showing the pretty brunette bloodied and bruised.

Speaking at the time Miss Butterworth said: 'He raised his arm and punched me in the face. It all happened so fast I didn't have time to defend myself. It felt like my face exploded, like an air bag had gone off.

'I fell to the floor and he kicked me and stamped on my face. I was knocked unconscious.

'When I came around I couldn't see out of my eyes as my face had swollen up so much. I looked like a zombie.'

Miss Butterworth needed treatment at the Royal United Hospital in Bath after the attack and could not open her right eye for weeks.

After Hayden was shown injuries he said: 'I didn't know I was that much of an animal'.

He was handed an 18-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to complete an anger management course.

Magistrates were told he would return from prison 'full of problems' and decided that custody would be the 'easy option'.

But violent Hayden was hauled before Chippenham Magistrates Court again last week after assaulting his current girlfriend Miss Weaver on March 28 this year.

Spared: Magistrates handling the case said not sending Hayden (pictured) to jail would be the 'tough option'

Magistrates heard how, after an argument, he forcefully shoved Miss Weaver out the way and drove off in her car.

Miss Weaver withdrew her complaint after six weeks but prosecutors pursued the case and Hayden pleaded guilty to common assault at the first opportunity.

Michelle Hewitt, prosecuting, said: 'They had been arguing. She didn't want him to drive off in her car.

'He pushed her as he went past and left the house.

'Amy Weaver made a statement of withdrawal, telling police everything was true but she did not want to pursue it.'

Moses Tawo, defending, said: 'He felt cornered. She was blocking his way. He pushed her out of the way just to get away.

'There were no injuries. She attended the first hearing, she wasn't supporting the charges. He still needs a bit of help with conflict resolution.'

Hayden admitted using his girlfriend's car without insurance and a licence, and was fined £200 and got six penalty points.

He was acquitted at trial of taking the car without consent.

He must also pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. The court heard he already had £1,390 in outstanding fines, some in the hands of bailiffs.

Reacting to the sentence, Polly Neate, Chief Executive of the 
domestic abuse charity Women's Aid, said: 'Abusers often deny women the 
freedom to live their lives through their controlling and violent 
behaviour.

'Sentencing 
guidelines state that domestic violence offences should be considered no
 less serious than other crimes, and would often be more serious because
 of their context.

'We expect and urge all courts to keep to these 
guidelines to ensure that victims can be protected, and perpetrators 
know abusive behaviour will be taken seriously.'
