FIFA executives were seriously divided at their meeting in Morocco over Michael Garcia’s World Cup corruption report, despite their later pretence that there was unanimous support for publication of the document.

Some ExCo members were upset Garcia mentioned in his resignation statement that the 25-strong committee had reported him to the FIFA disciplinary committee for breaking ethics rules after he spoke out in favour of transparency around his findings.

Then Spain’s Angel Maria Villar Llona, one of three ExCo members under investigation over World Cup bid conduct, astonished colleagues in Marrakech by admitting he alone had made the complaint about Garcia and wanted the minutes altered accordingly.

Only Sepp Blatter's health can prevent the FIFA president from running for another term

American Sunil Gulati, one of the FIFA modernisers, also ensured previous ExCo meeting minutes were changed to reflect that a number of the committee had wanted full publication from the start — which he felt president Sepp Blatter had not made clear.

Meanwhile, Blatter’s health is now the only factor likely to stop him standing for a ludicrous fifth term. And Blatter, 79 in March, is said to be ‘invigorated’ by persuading the FIFA ExCo to accept full publication of the Garcia report. A split ExCo on this issue would have made life very difficult for him before the election in May.

Certainly the relentless global travel to prop up his support does not seem to be weakening him. Blatter told Sports Agenda that his entourage feel the pace more than him.

Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling has been approached about becoming president of Hartlepoolm United

Hartlepool's new Midlands-based ownership consortium have approached Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling, who promotes his team at every opportunity, to become president. And the Sky man’s acceptance of the ambassador role is sure to go down better with supporters than convicted rapist Ched Evans being linked with the Football League’s bottom club.

The FIFA ExCo may have agreed to publish — where possible — the full Michael Garcia report into World Cup bid corruption but the governing body are braced for the American lawyer, who has resigned from his FIFA ethics role, to have plenty to say. His explosive missives, which could derail FIFA at any time, come via his Kirkland & Ellis law firm in Chicago without warning.

There is obviously something very wrong with the way the Lawn Tennis Association nurture talent when friends say 21-year-old Oliver Golding, who was the US Open boys’ champion just three years ago, now intends to quit the sport.

RACING'S QATAR LOVE IN  

Goodwood's racecourse’s extraordinary, decade-long festival sponsorship with the Qatar Equestrian Federation, worth at least £2.5million a year, highlights the contrast between football’s suspicion about Qatar’s World Cup bid and the way British racing has embraced the country’s massive patronage.

British Horseracing Authority chairman Steve Harman said the Goodwood deal transcended racing and was great for British sport and trade. But Harman also summed up racing’s insular culture when he said football’s difficulties in accepting the wholly unsuitable Qatar as a World Cup stage was a ‘bit like a sideshow’.

Goodwood launched their Qatar association at the top of London’s Shard, which is also owned by the money-no-object Qataris.

David Kogan, the TV rights wizard behind the last five Premier League auctions, has left Wasserman Media Group to set up another company — Exile Enterprises — having previously sold Reel Enterprises to WMG three years ago. But the combative Kogan will still be acting as chief adviser to PL CEO Richard Scudamore in the current tender, which could bring £10m a game and nearly £5bn overall.

The manifesto of secondary ticket-selling firm Seatwave effectively describes Culture Secretary Sajid Javid and Minister for Sport Helen Grant as ‘our slippery representatives in Westminster’, adding that Seatwave has ‘no intention of slithering out of our manifesto promise’. This is the same Seatwave who are strongly lobbying MPs to ditch proposals added by peers to the Consumer Rights Bill that will protect fans from internet touts.
