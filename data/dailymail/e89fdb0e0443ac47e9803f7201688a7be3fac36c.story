A six-year-old boy has touched the heart of dozens of firefighters battling it out in South Australia by donating his beloved birthday cake. 

Jackson Newman had his birthday party cancelled over the weekend after his family were forced to evacuate their Birdwood home, just north east of Adelaide.

His Transformer themed birthday cake, made and decorated by his mother Melissa Newman, became part of the dozens of products donated to the Country Fire Service (CFS).

'We were evacuated and came back on Sunday afternoon – the house was still quite smoky then – and some friends on Facebook said they were taking some stuff to the CFS,' Ms Newman told Daily Mail Australia.

'I put some things together and asked Jackson "well, what about your cake? We can't eat all of that cake should we give it to the firefighters?" and he said "yep, that'll make them strong because it's a transformer cake".'

Ms Newman described her son as having a big heart and a good personality, adding that despite his age he processed things well.

She said that although her son didn't get to share his cake with the firefighters, they were so touched by his donation that they visited him to return the favour with a gift of their own.

CFS member and NSW Rural Fire Service worker Michael El Khoury (right) described how Jackson's touching donation brought him to tears. Mr El Khoury and over a dozen other firefighters visited Jackson (left) to thank him for his touching gift 

'I was so overwhelmed when I got the phone call to say 'can we meet him?' she said.

'I expected maybe one fire truck to come out, but there were six trucks that came, including a double cabin truck, and people were coming out of it left right and centre. 'They presented him with a hat as a present and he was very overwhelmed.'

'Little Jackson made me cry yesterday morning when I saw the cake! After meeting him and seeing his smile, I felt like I won the lotto!!! Long live the service I serve,' Mr El Khoury wrote on Facebook. 

Although he had to have his birthday party cancelled due to needing to evacuate his home, which was at risk of going up in flames, Jackson (pictured in the fire truck window) was overwhelmed by the six trucks filled with volunteers who came to visit him and present him with a hat 

Firefighters expressed how Jackson's gift moved them on social media 

Shaun Doughty was also touched by the sentiment, declaring that gestures like this were 'the reason I am a volunteer'.

'Some people might not think it is much but to me this better than any pay cheque,' he wrote. 

However the Newman family are yet to unpack their bags after their first evacuation, with conditions expected to escalate over Tuesday and Wednesday as temperatures soar.

Over 12,500 hectares of land and 38 homes have been destroyed or badly damaged as well as 129 other buildings such as farm sheds and businesses, with the number expected to rise.

Jackson's support is just one of many unique donations being made by South Australian locals, with fruit market owner Justin Golding delivering 65 kilograms worth of fruit to his local fire station on Saturday to show his appreciation.
