Surviving relatives of Holocaust victims who stashed treasured possessions before being sent to Auschwitz and their deaths have been tracked down in Australia.

Little more than a week after MailOnline highlighted the find in Slovakia, Eva Wittenberg, daughter of the only surviving member of Samuel Gottschall's family and her brother, Alex Gottshall, were tracked down in Australia. She described the discovery of the items as 'miraculous'.

On December 31, MailOnline revealed that the personal belongings, including jewellery boxes and family photos, were found in the city of Presov in Slovakia.

Descendants: The surviving relatives of Jewish Rabbi Samuel Gottschall will soon receive the items discovered in the attic in Slovakia. Pictured are Eva and Alex's children and grandchildren

Hidden treasures: Cutlery, photographs and documents were found in the house in Presov, Slovakia, by a handyman fixing the roof

Haunting: This photograph was found in the stash of personal belongings of the Gottschall family

Handyman Imrich Girasek was fixing his neighbour's leaking roof when he made the discovery in a dim and damp attic.

Speaking from her home in Sydney, Mrs Wittenberg, 66, said: 'It was like getting a message from heaven – as if we were making contact with our grandparents and uncles and aunts and cousins that we have never known, because they were all murdered at Auschwitz.

'It was like a miracle. We are overjoyed that the things were found, it's beyond description really.'

Alex added: 'On the other hand, we are pained and sad about the immense suffering of our family that it brings back.'

Mr Girasek found the items next to suitcases from the period, which he believes had been looted.

He carefully leafed through the documents and photographs – among them wedding pictures and family portraits – but was not able to identify the people in the pictures.

Mr Girasek gave the items to the city's Museum of Jewish Culture with the hope the family could be identified and relatives located.

Following research, it was believed the items belonged to the family of Jewish Rabbi Samuel Gottschall.

Mr Gottschall, born in 1878, was deported to the concentration camp in 1942 along with his entire family. It is thought the items were hidden before their deportation.

Poignant: These family photos were taken before the deportation of the city's Jews began

Discovered: The photographs found in the Presov home are now known to belong to Mr Gottschall's family

Discovered: This document, believed to feature college graduates, includes a photograph of a man with the surname Gottschall

Mrs Wittenberg is the granddaughter of Samuel Gottschall and daughter of his only surviving child, Benjamin Vojtech Gottshall.

Since the haunting discovery featured in an MailOnline article on December 31, Mrs Wittenberg has been tracked down and she and her family have been overwhelmed with kind messages from people who had read the story.

'We have received emails from all over the world, from as far away as Tennessee and California and from all over Australia,' Mrs Wittenberg said. 'They have asked if we are connected to the discovery that appeared.  People have been very kind, and we want to thank MailOnline for caring about this miraculous discovery.

'It means a lot to us, and it would have made my father very happy to know that the world has been told that there once was a good man named Samuel Gottschall who lived with his family in Presov and was killed during the war.'

Samuel Gottschall, his wife, four children and two grandchildren all died at Auschwitz before the end of the Second World War, as did the entire extended family.

Only one Gottschall family member was still alive when the Red Army liberated Auschwitz in the spring of 1945 - Benjamin Gottschall, the father of Mrs Wittenberg and her younger brother, Alex Gottshall (the C was dropped from the surname by the family in Australia).

Benjamin was serving as a rabbi in the Slovakian city of Louny when he was captured and deported in late 1941.

Slovakia, an ally of Nazi Germany, played a very active and unflattering role in the Holocaust. 

Anti-Semitic sentiments ran every bit as deep in the small Central European state as in neigbouring Germany, and the ruling national-conservative and Catholic-based Slovak People's Party, which took over shortly before the outbreak of World War II, eventually went as far as paying Germany to help empty the country of its Jewish population – the 'alien element' and 'permanent enemy of the state', s Interior Minister Sano Mach described the ethnic minority in a speech.

In 1941, Slovakia's government introduced the Jewish Codex, a large catalog of paragraphs which effectively stripped the Jewish community of all civil rights and means of providing for itself.

This was, however, only a first step on the way to achieving the end-goal. In February 1942 Prime Minister Voytech Tuka declared that Slovakia would deport 10,000 to 20,000 young, strong men from Slovakia's Jewish population to Germany as part of a deal to provide workers to the Nazi regime.

Before the first transport even took place, however, Slovakia's government had convinced Germany to help make the country entirely free of Jews. According to the new deal, Germany would take all Slovakian Jews and guarantee that no-one ever returned, while Slovakia agreed to pay Germany 500 Reichsmark for every person deported.

The Vatican, among others, officially protested the plan, but the Slovak government remained hard. 'We shall not stop this action under any circumstance,' the interior minister made clear. 

'There is no foreign intervention which would stop us on the road to the liberation of Slovakia from Jewry,' Sano Mach declared in a radio address on April 1, 1942, four days after the first deportation train containing 999 Jewish women had left the Slovak city of Poprad with Auschwitz as destination.

Before the war, some 136,000 Jews lived in Slovakia. Today, merely 4,000 people of Jewish descent are registered as living here. Historical sources estimate that as much as 80,000 Slovak Jews were deported to concentration camps during ther war.

In Presov, the third-largest city in Slovakia, the numbers are staggering: Some 6,000 Jews were deported from Presov to concentration camps between 1942 and 1945. Only 800 people returned to the city after the war, many of which later emigrated, among them the father of Mrs. Wittenberg and Mr. Gottshall. 

His parents assumed him dead and marked it with a one-week mourning period - yet he would be the only one of a large family to be alive after the war.

He continued to perform secret religious services for his fellow prisoners in Theresienstadt concentration camp and later Auschwitz.

His wife died in the death camp Bergen-Belsen.

Benjamin also dedicated the remainder of his life to religion and community work.

'Our father made a promise to God while he was in Auschwitz that he would spend his life as a communal rabbi in small Jewish communities where he was most needed,' said Mr Gottshall.

'That was one of the things that kept him going – and he also kept his promise.'

Benjamin remarried after the war and served as rabbi to fellow Holocaust survivors in Prague, before emigrating to Australia.

He arrived in Melbourne in 1949 with his pregnant wife and a baby - Mrs Wittenberg. 

Benjamin mourned the loss of his three brothers, his sister and parents all his life, his children say.

He marked the birthdays of his siblings every year, but otherwise he and his wife, who also lost her entire family, never spoke much of the horrors they experienced.

'They were positive people who also taught us to have a positive approach to life,' Mrs Wittenberg said. For that we are grateful and admire them.'

Newspapers: Clippings from Hungarian papers were among the items hidden in the home

Manuscript:Samuel Gottschall's music. Now his great-grandchildren can perform it

Benjamin died of cancer in Sydney in 1978, at the age of 71.

His life story has been well documented, and the Jewish museum in Prague is planning to run an exhibition about him.

The photographs and personal belongings found in Presov will form part of the display.

Mrs Wittenberg and her brother are waiting to receive the package from the Museum of Jewish Culture in Presov, where the discovered items have been stored.

They are most excited about a book full of sheet music composed by Rabbi Samuel Gottschall, who also led the choir in the local synagogue and composed religious music.

'My oldest son is a wonderful singer and also leads a choir in a synagogue here in Sydney,' Mrs Wittenberg added.

'It will be a very special experience to hear him perform the music of his great-grandfather.'

Slovakia had been an ally of Nazi Germany and the country supplied it with workers.

However, when it fell short of the promised numbers, it agreed to replace the shortfall with 10,000 to 20,000 deported Slovak Jews.

Before the war, some 136,000 Jews lived in Slovakia, but now there are only about 4,000.

In Presov, the third-largest city in Slovakia, some 6,000 Jews were deported to concentration camps between 1942 and 1945.

Only 800 people returned to the city after the war and many of them later emigrated, often to the US, Australia, Israel and the UK.
