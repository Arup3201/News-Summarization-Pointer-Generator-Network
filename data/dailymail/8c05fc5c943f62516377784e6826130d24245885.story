People living in the leafy suburbs of Guildford in Surrey can live up to 20 years longer than those in the city of Bradford, according to a new analysis of life expectancy.

Boys born in Guildford and Waverly can expect to live to 70.3 years and girls 71.3 years but 220 miles away babies in Bradford can expect to live to only 52.5 years for boys and 51.6 for girls.

It comes as figures show the traditional age gap which sees women outlive men has narrowed nationwide to less than four years for the first time.

A baby boy born today can expect to live 78.7 years and a newborn baby girl 82.6 years, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The ONS said: ‘The gap between life expectancy at birth between boys and girls in the UK has narrowed from six years in 1980-1982 to under four years in 2010-2012.’

Life expectancy for men has increased by two and a half years per decade since 1980, but by only two years per decade for women, leading to the narrowing gap.

When men reach 65, they can expect to live for another 18.2 years, a 40 per cent increase from 1980-82 to 2010-12.

However women aged 65 can expect to live for another 20.7 years, a rise of only 23 per cent in three decades.

A new analysis of heath areas reveals the wide disparities between different parts of the country.

How life expectancy has narrowed

A breakdown of NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups, which replaced Primary Care Trusts in the coalition’s health reforms, shows where life expectancy is longest.

The gap between the best and the worst areas was 17.8 years for men and 19.7 years for women.

NHS Guildford and Waverley had the highest healthy life expectancy at birth for men (70.3 years) and women (71.3 years).

By comparison, NHS Bradford City has the lowest life expectancy at birth, 52.5 years for boys and 51.6 years for girls.

All 10 of the best performing Clinical Commissioning Groups were ‘clustered in an area to the south and west of London’, the ONS said.

The CCGs with the lowest life expectancy were in the North, the Midlands and some ethnically diverse parts of East London.

In 2010-2012 a man in the UK aged 85 had an average further 5.8 years of life remaining and a woman 6.8 years

The ONS said: ‘Life expectancy at birth in the UK has reached its highest level on record for both males and females.

‘A newborn baby boy could expect to live 78.7 years and a newborn baby girl 82.6 years if mortality rates remain the same as they were in 2010-2012 throughout their lives.

‘Women continue to live longer than men, but the gap has been closing. Although both sexes have shown annual improvements in life expectancy at birth, over the past 30 years the gap has narrowed from 6.0 years to 3.9 years with males demonstrating faster improvements in mortality compared to females.’

Life expectancy across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the last three decades.

The ONS said: ‘In England life expectancy at birth has risen to 79.0 years for males and 82.8 years for females, the highest of all constituent countries in 2010-2012

‘Life expectancy for 2010-2012 in Wales has reached 78.1 years for males and 82.1 years for females while in Northern Ireland it has reached 77.7 years for males and 82.1 years for females.

‘Males in Scotland have a life expectancy at birth of 76.5 years and for females it is 80.7 years, the lowest of all constituent countries in 2010-2012.

‘The greatest gains have been seen in Northern Ireland where male life expectancy has increased by 8.5 years and female life expectancy by 6.6 years since 1980-1982.

‘The lowest gains in life expectancy at birth have been seen in Scotland. Since 1980-1982 male life expectancy at birth has increased by 7.4 years and females have seen an increase of 5.4 years.

‘Scotland continues to have the lowest life expectancy at birth of all the constituent countries for both males and females.

‘This could be associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption, a greater smoking prevalence and higher levels of cardio-vascular diseases in Scotland compared to the other constituent countries of the UK.’
