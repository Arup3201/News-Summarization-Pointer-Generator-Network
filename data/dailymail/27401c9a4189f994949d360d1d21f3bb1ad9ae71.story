Injury-hit Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden has revealed how he refuses to consider hanging up his boots as he tackles a 'brutal' rehab regime.

The 29-year-old American international has suffered a succession of serious injuries during the past four years.

Holden underwent a knee operation after suffering ligament damage during an Under 21 match against Everton in March. He returned to the States for his latest recovery programme in the belief he can make another comeback.

In a blog on ESPN, Holden wrote: 'The daily grind of rehab is brutal. I am constantly being tested, some days physically, some days mentally and some days both! By this point, I could wear the unenviable name tag of "professional gym rat" around my neck.

'If you talk to the physical therapists I've worked with over the last couple years, James Hashimoto and Holly Silvers, they would vouch for the fact that I now consider myself quite the expert in the subject of injury recovery.

'The latest ACL tear, which I suffered playing for Bolton's reserves in March, has been my biggest test to date. When something you love -- and have worked so incredibly hard for your entire life -- is repeatedly taken away from you, it's disheartening, devastating and (insert every synonym for sucks so bad).

'People on the outside don't see the sweat, the frustration and, sometimes, the tears. The comments I read and hear are: "You're injured, you can't help the team, and you need to get back on the field."

'If only it were that simple.'

'Not a day goes by where I'm not wishing I was out there, competing against the world's elite. It really hurts to watch my teammates run out on the field, score goals and celebrate in ecstasy. It cuts like a knife to know exactly what it would feel like to be in that moment and not be able to be a part of it.' 

Holden has suffered numerous injuries with the midfielder first breaking his leg while playing for the USA four years ago.

Following his comeback, Holden then injured his left knee following a challenge from Manchester United defender Jonny Evans in March 2011 which kept him out for a further year.

The Red Devils centre back was dismissed for the tackle and later apologised to Holden.

The Bolton player was carried off with a deep gash on his knee that required 26 stitches.

His latest attempted return came after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament, again during international duty, against Panama in the CONCACAF Gold Cup last June.
