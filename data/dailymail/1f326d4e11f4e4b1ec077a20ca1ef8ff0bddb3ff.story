David Cameron was accused of presiding over a damaging 'fudge-a-rama' on Heathrow last night – as it emerged that an independent review of airport capacity will not report back for three years.

The Prime Minister told MPs that he would be announcing an independent commission in the coming days in a bid to settle the vexed question on where new airport capacity in the South East should be put.

Former CBI boss Sir Howard Davies will lead the review, which ministers hope will win cross-party backing.

Finger pointing: Boris Johnson has vowed to fight any Heathrow expansion and challenged David Cameron to rule it out 'forever'

But the appointment of Sir Howard, who made his name as an advocate for business, is likely to raise eyebrows.

Green groups also drew attention to his time as a special adviser to former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who is now one of the country's leading climate change sceptics.

Sir Howard, who oversaw the creation of the Financial Services Authority, hit the headlines last year when he was forced to quit as director of the London School of Economics following revelations about its links to Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi.

Boris Johnson and David Cameron are good friends - but they have a funny way of showing it.

The Mayor of London has regularly launched attacks and poked fun at the Prime Minister.

Mr
Johnson was elected for a second term in charge of the capital in May, 
but used a speech to supporters to admit they did it despite the Prime 
Minister.

Mocking him Boris said: 'We survived the rain, 
the BBC, the Budget - and the endorsement of David Cameron.'

Four years earlier, Boris turned on Mr Cameron over his claims that British society was 'broken'.

He
said that the now Prime Minister's claims were 'piffle' adding that the
success of British Olympians in Beijing proves youngsters are far from 
'aimless, 
feckless and hopeless, addicted to their PlayStations'.

But
it was just last month that the Mayor launched an extraordinary attack 
on David Cameron yesterday, warning him to stop ‘pussyfooting around’ on
the economy.

He urged Mr Cameron to be more 
‘ambitious’ by cutting taxes, cutting regulation and investing in 
infrastructure such as a new airport in the South-East.

And now today he has tried to embarrass the Prime Minister over Heathrow.

But his report will not be published until the summer of 2015, after the next election.

The decision will cause dismay in the business community which argues that an urgent decision is needed to keep Britain competitive.

London Mayor Boris Johnson launched a furious attack on the Government's stance, saying it was 'madness' to even consider expanding Heathrow.

Mr Johnson, who is promoting his own scheme for a new runway on an island in the Thames estuary, said the decision to hold a three-year review would damage business.

He said: 'It's just a fudge, it's just a fudge-a-rama and it's just an excuse for a delay – there's almost three years to run until 2015.

'If such a commission were not to report until after the next election we'd have lost a huge amount of time. I don't think British business would be remotely satisfied with that answer.

'What I worry about is that we are now seeing a stealthy U-turn being carried out which I don't think is in the interests of London or indeed of the country as a whole.'

Asked if he would lead a campaign against expansion at Heathrow he replied: 'You bet I will, yes.'

Mr Johnson acknowledged that No 10 was 'very cross' about his intervention and refused to rule out seeking a return to the Commons at a by-election to fight any attempt to expand Heathrow.

Prominent Tory Zac Goldsmith, a former adviser on the environment to Mr Cameron, said he feared a U-turn on Heathrow was underway.

He said this week's removal of Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who was firmly opposed to Heathrow expansion, showed that 'the Government is at least trying to open the door to the possibility of a third runway'.

New Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is said to have an 'open mind' on Heathrow, although his new deputy Simon Burns has in the past described the idea of a third runway as 'environmental vandalism'.

In the Commons, Mr Cameron insisted that Government policy had not changed. He said: 'While I believe we need to establish a form of review that will bring parties together and make a decision about airport capacity, I will not be breaking my manifesto pledge.'

Ed Miliband said he remained 'sceptical' about the case for a third runway at Britain's only international hub airport.

Nick Clegg insisted a third runway 'will not happen' under the Coalition. 'My party's manifesto is against a third runway and the Coalition Agreement could not have been clearer – we have ruled out giving the go-ahead to a runway during this Parliament. It will not happen during this Parliament,' he said.

Tory backbencher Tim Yeo, who last week called on Mr Cameron to show whether he is 'a man or a mouse' on airport capacity, said: 'We need more runway capacity in the South East in the 2020s – not in the 2030s.'

Mr
Johnson, said Miss Greening had been a 'first-rate Transport 
Secretary'.

'There can be only one reason to move
her – and that is to expand Heathrow airport,' he said. 'It is simply 
mad to build a new runway in the middle of West London.

'Nearly a third of the victims of aircraft noise in the whole of Europe live in the vicinity of Heathrow.

'Now it is clear that the Government wants to ditch its promises and send yet more planes over central London.

'The third runway would mean more 
traffic, more noise, more pollution – and a serious reduction in the 
quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people. We will fight this 
all the way.'

He told Sky News's Sunrise programme: 'There's lots of stuff been coming out of Whitehall to suggest that a U-turn is in progress and they want to build a third runway at Heathrow - all the pressure from businesses to do the third runway, that's where the Treasury seems to be focusing its hopes.

'I think that is a profound mistake. It is not deliverable, it would do massive environmental damage, not just in West London but for residents accross the city. There are much, much better solutions that will deliver long-term growth and jobs.' 

Prominent Tory MP Zac Goldsmith told the Today programme: 'I think it’s impossible to pretend that this isn’t a sign, because we haven’t just lost Justine Greening from this Department, we’ve also seen Theresa Villiers moved out – both of whom were absolutely rock solid on this issue in terms of defending what is still the Government’s line officially.

'The Conservative Party made an unambiguous promise before the election, as did the Liberal Democrats – it could not have been clearer; the Coalition Agreement immediately after the election could not have been clearer.'

He again reiterated his threat to trigger a by-election if the Government did perform a U-turn.

'I promised people before the election that if the Government performed a U-turn, I would trigger an immediate by-election and that people in this constituency would have a chance to have their say. Absolutely [I stand by that],' he said.

Ministers have come under intense 
pressure from business to approve a third runway at Heathrow, Britain's 
only international hub airport.

Some Tories are also calling for a 
U-turn, with former minister Tim Yeo saying the issue was a test of 
whether the Prime Minister is a 'man or a mouse'.

No 10 denied that Miss Greening's removal signalled a shift in aviation policy.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said a planned review of airport capacity would still go ahead.

Supporters of expansion at Heathrow 
will be invited to make their case, but the spokesman said the Coalition
agreement, which rules out a third runway before 2015, still stood.

But Andy Atkins, executive director of
Friends of the Earth, said Miss Greening had been 'shunted out of her 
transport job because of her opposition to a third runway at Heathrow' 
adding that more airports or runways in the South-East 'would have a 
devastating impact on local communities and the environment'.

On HS2, Mr McLoughlin will face 
opposition from Tory voters who live close to the proposed route. He 
will also be under pressure to limit next January's planned 6.2 per cent
rise in rail fares.

Plan: The airport would be on the Isle of Grain in Kent and would have high-speed rail connections across Britain and Europe taking pressure of Heathrow
