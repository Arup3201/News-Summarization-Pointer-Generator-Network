Erik Lamela showed glimpses of why Tottenham spent £30million on him with a friendly double against Toronto.

The 22-year old Argentine, who made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances in an injury-hit campaign last season, has vowed to recreate the form which brought him 15 Serie A goals in 2012-13 with Roma.

And if he continues like this, he just might. Lamela firing his first on 18 minutes with a Gareth Bale-esque finish from just inside the box, and his second with equal aplomb five minutes before the break.

Roberto Soldado was provider for both in the pre-season friendly at BM Field, giving further optimism to Spurs fans, who saw former striker Jermain Defoe captain their opponents.

Lamela's opener came after Christian Eriksen launched a swift counter-attack on the right, bursting into the Toronto half before feeding Soldado.

As the Spanish forward approached the area, he looked up and sprayed a pass across the area.

Aaron Lennon unselfishly left the ball for the advancing Lamela, whose low left-footed shot whistled past Chris Konopka and into the bottom right-hand corner.

Lamela started the move which led to his second, finding Lennon and making a lung-busting run into the box.

The former England winger slipped the ball to Soldado on the edge of the area. Spotting the onrushing Lamela, his perfectly-weighted pass was controlled by Lamela before he blasted home from a tight angle with another clinical left foot effort.

At half-time, Mauricio Pochettino made 10 substitutions, with only Brad Friedel remaining from the first-half XI.

Toronto punished defensive uncertainty between central defensive pairing Michael Dawson and Zeki Fryers by battling back to restore parity.

Substitute Andrew Wiedeman was involved in both, hitting the first before setting up Jordan Hamilton, who defied his 18 years by beating Friedel with a cool finish from inside the area.

But Andros Townsend showed his class with a quality finish to win the game for Spurs. Lewis Holtby snatched possession and surged forward, feeding the England winger on the left. He twisted and turned before unleashing a clinical finish to win the game.

New signing Ben Davies sported the No 33 shirt in his first appearance for the club, just hours after sealing his move from Swansea.

The left back moves to White Hart Lane with keeper Michel Vorm as Gylfi Sigurdsson heads the other way, with the south Wales side receiving £3.5m.

The match saw some familiar faces for Tottenham, with club legend Defoe wearing the armband for Toronto, whose coach Ryan Nelsen is also a former Spurs player.
