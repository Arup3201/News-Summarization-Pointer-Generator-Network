A staggering 57 per cent of men and women in the UK admit to fantasising about someone other than their partner when they're having sex with them.

Women are the biggest culprits with 45 per cent admitting to indulging in their fantasy figure during a romp with their other half.

More than a third of all couples (35 per cent) say the most common time they do this is just after they've had an argument with their significant other.

Lovers 
aged 35-44 are most likely to fantasise about someone else, and the most 
common fantasies are about someone they know in real life rather than a sexy 
celebrity.

Welsh
 lovers are most likely to fantasise about someone inappropriate (40 per
 cent), while people from the East Midlands are more likely to have sexy
 thoughts about a celebrity during sex (35 per cent).

Yorkshire
 residents like to sexually dream about someone they know -  yet the 
Scottish prefer to fantasise about their partner and 
no one else.

But rather than worry your relationship is doomed when you let your mind wonder during sex, it's actually perfectly healthy.

Celebrity sexpert Dr Pam Spurr, a psychologist, self-help expert and
 broadcaster, was enlisted to explain the results.

'Fantasising provides an escape route which helps climax,' she says.

'The
 fact that women do this more often could be that they feel more shy or 
inhibited to ask their partner to try a different technique - at least 
with fantasies, they give women what they need to reach a mind blowing 
climax without having to ask!'

When asked what their sexual 'guilty pleasure fantasy' was, 40 per cent of Brits admitted it was sex with an ex.

Other high-scoring results included role play, bondage, watching porn - and a threesome.

For women, their top sexual fantasy was role play - and for men, sex with an ex topped the list.

Dr Pam says: 'I'm not surprised the top fantasy for women is about role play.

'Many women secretly want to 'sex-periment' in the bedroom, so fantasy role play is perfect for trying exciting scenarios.

'Although
 the common preconception is that male fantasies are always dirty, 
adventurous or kinky - the fact the majority fantasise about sex with an
 ex shows they like to revisit this well-travelled sexual territory.

'This type of been there, done that sexual imagery can help boost a man's sexual confidence in the here-and-now.

'The
 crucial difference revealed between men's and women's fantasy is about 
adventurousness. Where the top male fantasy of ex-sex is about keeping 
it easy and relaxed, women want to let go and do things they don't 
normally dare to.'

Ann Summers have conducted a nationwide Great British Pleasure Survey

Ann Summers delved into Britain's pleasure zone and asked 3,000 Brits what turns them on. 

The
 results were eye opening and offer a fascinating insight into the 
nation's guilty pleasure, desires and ultimate sexual fantasies.

Nearly
 half of Britons (45 per cent) admit to doing something 'pleasurable' on
 a weekly basis - with lovers in East Anglia being the biggest pleasure 
seekers, with 11 per cent claiming they have sex every day, followed 
closely by the Welsh (10 per cent) and Yorkshire (8 per cent). 

Couples from the North East have the least amount of sex; with 5 per cent claiming they only do the deed once a year.

And it seems that Britons are quite the pleasure seekers when it comes to getting frisky in places other than the bedroom.

Although 42 per cent claim they keep their lovemaking in the boudoir, 25 per cent regularly get hot and steamy in the shower.

A further 15 per cent have got it on in the workplace, 9 per cent in public place, 7 per cent in the gym and 2 per cent admit to having got away with having a sneaky romp in a church.

Londoners are most likely to get jiggy at the gym, Scottish find their thrills in a park, Yorkshire lovers are most likely to get it on at work and those in the East Midlands like to have sex in the cinema.

The 
nationwide survey also delved in Britons' porn habits and discovered 
that 40 per cent of couples watch porn together on a weekly basis.

Over
 half (55 per cent) of women admit to watching porn on their own at 
least once a month with a further 40 per cent admitting to switching it 
(solo) on a weekly basis. More surprisingly perhaps, 9 per cent of women
 say they watch it daily. 

Of those who confessed to watching porn with their partner, 58 per cent claimed it had a positive effect on their relationship.

When asked what their sexual 'guilty pleasure fantasy' was, 40 per cent of Brits admitted it was sex with an ex

Dr Pam says: 'The traditional view that watching porn is a man's prerogative isn't always a fact, as there is a sea of change in sexual attitudes when it comes to porn viewing among the sexes, particularly in women. There are more female-friendly porn options available and women are actively switching on more regularly than ever before.'

'It is completely normal to fantasise about someone else during sex because the human mind is incredibly creative. With fantasies, you can roam into erotic territory involving anyone from a celebrity to a neighbour.

'Many confide that the best fantasies involve having sex with their partner but with someone else – whether that be a celebrity or neighbour - joining them for supercharged three-way sex.It's a reality in life that sometimes sex becomes routine. However, by injecting your fantasy into your sex life, it can boost libido levels and revive the excitement and lust with your partner.'

Hot Octopuss, makers of PULSE, the world's first male vibrator, have used the latest medical technology to create the revolutionary new sex toy for men.

The pioneering British sex toy brand has observed that more men than ever are now admitting to having tried a sex toy on themselves at some point in their lives.

The brand has sold over 10,000 units in the first six months and this shows no signs of slowing.

To highlight the evolution, the creative team at Hot Octopuss designed a tongue-in-cheek video taking you through the journey of male pleasure over the years. With starring roles from the every day gym sock, Playboy magazine and the questionable vacuum cleaner, the video aims to demonstrate just how PULSE is revolutionising the way we think, and indeed go about sex.
