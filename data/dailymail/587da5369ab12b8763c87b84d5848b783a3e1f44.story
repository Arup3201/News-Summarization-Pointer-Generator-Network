Montpellier have confirmed that they have reached an agreement with Tottenham for the sale of midfielder Benjamin Stambouli.

The 24-year-old former France Under-21 international is  heading to England to undergo a medical and put pen to paper.

Stambouli had been close to a £4.7million move to Fiorentina, while Swansea had also made a bid.
