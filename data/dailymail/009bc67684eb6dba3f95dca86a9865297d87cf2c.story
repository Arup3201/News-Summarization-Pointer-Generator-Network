Treasure hunters are still flocking to a beach five months after an artist buried 30 pieces of gold worth £10,000 because more than two thirds of it could still be out there.

Michael Sailstorfer hid dozens of 24-carat gold bars on Folkestone's Outer Harbour beach in Kent in August this year as part of an arts festival - but only eight have been found.

Dozens of beach combers are seen walking the sands every day with metal detectors and spades in the hope of striking it lucky and finding one of the bars, which range in value from £250 to £500.

But organisers have said that some of the gold may never be found because of the shifting sands and said even the artist couldn't find it all now. 

The project was so popular that sales of digging tools including trowels, shovels and spades increased by almost 500 per cent at the local B&Q store, and people were even spotted combing the sands on Christmas Day.

Kevin Wood and his girlfriend Kirsty Henderson were the first to find one of the 30 gold bars hidden on the beach by the Berlin-based artist. 

Describing the moment he struck gold in August this year, Mr Wood, 28, said: 'My legs went from under me and I started shaking.

'I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach and half way home, we pulled over for a drink.'

Ioannis Ioannou from project managers Creative Foundation, said: 'We know that eight people have come forward having found gold.

'We don't know how many more people have found some, but decided to keep quiet about it.

'Of course, as part of the project, people were entitled to keep the gold they found.

'An important piece of this project was that we will never know if there is more gold out there, or if it has all been dug up - I personally believe that there is more.

'Even the artist couldn't find it all now, because sand shifts, so there is no way of knowing where it has disappeared to.'

The Folkestone Digs project is part of the town's triennial which has previously included work by artists including Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller and Martin Creed.

Artists including Yoko Ono took part is this year's festival which ran from 30 August to 2 November.
