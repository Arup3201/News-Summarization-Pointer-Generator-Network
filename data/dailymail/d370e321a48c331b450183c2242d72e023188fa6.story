Divers have begun salvaging treasure from a ship that was accidentally blown up 350 years ago in the Thames Estuary.

English Heritage is funding a two-year period of excavation of the wreck of HMS London, at a cost of £70,000.

The huge vessel sank in the Thames Estuary, not far from where Southend Pier has since been built, in March 1665, after mysteriously exploding on a journey from Chatham, Kent.

A team of divers, funded by English Heritage, have now been given the go-ahead to salvage the contents of the ship before it breaks apart

Charitable Trust Cotswold Archaeology will salvage the ship's artifacts from the rapidly deteriorating vessel and everything they bring to shore will eventually go on display at the Southend Museum, Essex.

The excavations began this week, with more dives planned for the coming months.

English Heritage archaeologist Mark Dunkley said: 'We are hoping to recover some rare and well-preserved items which will provide a great insight into the English Navy during an unsettled time when Britain was emerging as a global power.

'The recovery and display of vulnerable artifacts will aid our understanding of life on board ship in the late 17th century and enable us to remove the wreck from our Heritage at Risk Register.'

The wreck is about a mile from the end of Southend's famous pier and lies between eight to 12 metres deep, depending on the tides.

Divers say visibility is low around the wreckage but are still hopeful of recovering historical artifacts

The cost of the excavations will be covered by English Heritage's heritage at risk budget, as it feared the artifacts on board could be lost forever if the wreckage continues to break up.

The ship was discovered in 2005 by contractors surveying the estuary for the Port of London Authority.

The ship was immediately placed on English Heritage's at risk register as its fragile archaeological remains were being exposed by movement on the seabed.

Clare Hunt, of Southend Council's Museums Service, said: 'This hidden wreck lies just off Southend Pier, which is visited by thousands each year, yet the wreck remains largely unknown.'

She added: 'It's part of our local as well as our national history and we're inviting local people to get involved in recording these ship finds.'

Fishmonger Steve Ellis, who is an experienced diver, was part of a team who won the right to dive to wreckage in 2011.

He said: 'Although the underwater dive 
conditions are difficult with limited visibility, we are looking forward
 to bringing up some exciting finds.'

Exploratory dives suggest artefacts such as cooking utensils, ship fixtures, an anchor cable and even cannon balls may be found - although Mr Ellis admitted diving conditions may be tough.

HMS London was a 64-gun, second-rate ship of the English Navy, built in 1656, one of three second-rate large ships built between 1642 and 1660.

She gained fame as one of the ships which escorted Charles II home from Holland during the English Restoration.

Three hundred people died when she sank on March 7, 1665, after a sailor is believed to have taken a candle below deck, sparking an explosion in the ship's gunpowder stockpile.

The incident was covered in the diary of Samuel Pepys (right), who wrote: 'This morning is brought me to the office the sad newes of “The London,” in which Sir J[ohn] Lawson’s men were all bringing her from Chatham to the Hope, and thence he was to go to sea in her.

'But a little a’this side the buoy of the Nower, she suddenly blew up. About 24 [men] and a woman that were in the round-house and coach saved; the rest, being above 300, drowned: the ship breaking all in pieces, with 80 pieces of brass ordnance.'

In October 2008, the ship was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act (1973).

Her exact position has been kept a secret over fears illegal savage operations may be launched.
