One shot, one kill: Since World War One snipers have gone from hate figures to heroes

When the fresh-faced 19-year-old arrived on the Eastern Front in August 1943, his new comrades were delighted.

For several days, the entire company of the 144th Mountain Troop Regiment of the German Army had been pinned down by a solitary Russian sniper. It was the job of the new arrival ‘to get him off our backs’.

The young man, an Austrian by the name of Sepp Allerberger, was led to a parapet of logs that formed the edge of the trench. Squinting through a gap, he could see nothing suspicious in No Man’s Land.

He rolled up a tent and placed a cap on its top — then raised the cap above the level of the logs. After no more than a few seconds, the cap was shot off its perch.

The sniper’s impetuousness would prove to be an error, because the flash from his rifle revealed his position to Allerberger.

Gingerly, he eased the muzzle of his rifle through the gap in the logs. He estimated the enemy sniper to be about 100 yards away — so well within range.

However, as he lined up his target, Allerberger was seized by nerves. His heart was racing and the rifle shook.

He knew the cause: it would be the first time he had killed in cold blood. This, he thought, felt more like murder than combat.

‘What are you waiting for?’ hissed one of his comrades. ‘Let him have it!’ Somehow, those words helped Allerberger to calm down.

He squeezed the trigger and fired — hitting the Russian right between the eyes.

Despite earning many pats on his back from his comrades, Allerberger still felt a sense of revulsion at what he had done.

Austrian sniper Sepp Allerberger, who was sent to the Eastern Front as a fresh-faced 19-year-old and went on to kill 257 men

During the course of the war, he would kill 257 men — a tally that makes him one of history’s deadliest snipers.

However, none of his kills can match what was achieved in Afghanistan last year by an unnamed lance corporal in the Coldstream Guards.

On December 14, British troops in Central Helmand had spotted a suspected Taliban suicide bomber on the move and were sent to intercept him.

A firefight ensued, during which the British sniper observed a Taliban fighter armed with an AK47 climbing out of a ditch.

At a range of half a mile, the lance corporal took aim with his £25,000 L115A3 bolt-action sniper rifle, and hit the Taliban in the torso.

Unknown to the marksman, the terrorist was wearing a suicide vest, which was detonated by the high-velocity round.

Not only was the bomber vaporised, but so, too, were five of his fellow Taliban. With just one shot, the British sniper had killed six of the enemy.

Yesterday, when news of this shot broke, it made headlines around the world, revealing our enduring fascination with snipers.

The role of the sniper is very different to that of most military men. While the majority of soldiers work in units, the sniper usually works alone.

'Unsportsmanlike': An American sniper takes aim from the trenches during World War One

It is this notion of the sniper as the deadly lone wolf, clinically picking off the enemy from his hiding place, that so fires our imagination.

However, the sniper has not always been held in such high regard. A century ago, sniping was viewed as being against the ‘rules’ of warfare.

Though the British had raised a sniper unit, the Lovat Scouts, during the Second Boer War, there were many in the Army who saw sniping as underhand.

It took the horrors of World War I to make the top brass realise that it was an essential part of modern warfare.

For the first year of the war, German snipers, equipped with weapons with advanced sights, had wrought havoc in the trenches.

As one British general ruefully admitted: ‘Certainly we were slow to adopt — indeed, our souls abhorred — anything unsportsmanlike.’

After the Great War, nearly every army in the world developed specialist sniper schools.

Marksmanship is just one of the skills that is taught, as snipers also have to perfect the art of concealment. They also act as scouts and can learn much about enemy formations through their telescopic sights.

However, despite their obvious usefulness, by the outbreak of World War II, snipers were still poorly regarded by all sides.

Art of camouflage: A Russian sniper at the Finnish front in 1940

In his memoirs, Allerberger recalls how many young officers regarded snipers as ‘loathsome assassins’, and would decline their signatures when a sniper needed a kill confirmed for his record book.

The most successful sniper ever was a Finn called Simo Hayha, who shot 505 Russians during 100 days of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1940.

His achievement is all the more extraordinary because he did not use telescopic sights.

He didn’t appear to have been troubled by his deadly achievement, and claimed never to lose a night’s sleep over his killing of so many men.

‘I only did what I was told to do, as well as I could,’ he said.

Though sniping is often viewed as ‘man’s work’, World War II also  saw many female snipers, most of whom served in the Soviet Army.

The most celebrated was Lyudmila Pavlichenko, with 309 confirmed kills.

Killing did not come easily to her. ‘I knew my task was to kill human beings,’ she said. ‘In theory, that was fine, but I knew the real thing would be completely different.’

As with many snipers, she appeared to hesitate before her first kill. However, after witnessing the death of a comrade, she soon grew hardened — and ‘after that nothing could stop me’.

Those such as Pavlichenko, Allerberger and Hayha were lucky to have survived. On the Eastern Front, the average sniper managed to fire his rifle no more than 15 to 20 times before being killed.

Snipers are much less likely to die in today’s wars. Thanks to the astonishing range of their rifles, they can be more than a mile from their target and still have a chance of making a kill.

With state-of-the art weaponry like the British-made L115A3 rifle which can kill from well over a mile, snipers are much less likely to die in today's wars

The longest sniper kill on record was made by a British corporal in the Blues and Royals called Craig Harrison, who in November 2009 killed two Taliban machine gunners at a range of just over one-and-a-half miles (2,475m).

To make a kill at such a range requires more than just a steady hand and a good eye.

Modern snipers can be equipped with laser rangefinders, instruments that measure wind direction and speed, and even computers known as ‘ballistic support devices’ that can help the sniper work out where to aim.

Of course, as many snipers would tell you, some kills also require luck. Craig Harrison acknowledges that the weather conditions were near perfect for his long-range shot, with little or no wind and a lack of haze.

Despite their transformation from hate figures to heroes, sniping remains a tough role for any soldier. Through their sights, snipers can see all too clearly the gory results of their work.

On occasion, some kills, though necessary, make them feel very uncomfortable.

The late U.S. Navy Seal sniper Chris Kyle, who found himself looking down the sights at a woman combatant carrying a grenade during his first tour in Iraq

In late March 2003, Chris Kyle, a Navy Seal sniper, found himself in Nasiriya in Iraq about to make his first sniper kill.

Looking through the sights, he saw that his target was a woman carrying a hand grenade.

Just like Sepp Allerberger six decades before, Kyle paused. He had never killed a woman before. ‘Take a shot!’ his platoon chief hissed.

Kyle squeezed the trigger on his .300 Winchester Magnum rifle and the woman dropped to the ground before she could throw the grenade.

‘It was my duty to shoot and I don’t regret it,’ Kyle later recalled. ‘My shots saved several Americans, whose lives were clearly worth more than that woman’s twisted soul.’

But, like all snipers, for Kyle killing became chillingly routine.

‘After the first kill, the others come easy,’ he said. ‘I don’t have to psych myself up or do anything special mentally.’
