Mr Harper resigned on Saturday after discovering the woman was a working illegally in this country

Former Immigration Minister Mark Harper paid his illegal Colombian cleaner using expenses, it emerged today.

Mr Harper resigned on Saturday after discovering the woman was a working illegally in this country.

Last night he said the woman’s status ‘did not reflect the documents that I saw’.

The cleaner was named as Isabella Acevedo by the Daily Telegraph. She could now be removed from the country.

Mr
 Harper claimed more than £2,000 in parliamentary expenses to pay her to
 clean his flat in the Westminster Square development near Waterloo 
station.

The newspaper 
reported that Miss Acevedo worked for a number of people in the complex,
 which is popular with MPs, raising the prospect of other politicians 
being drawn into the affair.

The Forest of Dean MP said: ‘There are now going to be legal consequences for her. What I will say is that I checked her documents - I took them from her.

‘You can draw your own conclusions from this but her status did not reflect the documents that I saw.

‘There was a reason I didn’t really mention it in my letter - I was being careful because obviously I don’t want to impact the case that will deal with her.

‘Obviously it was tempting to include everything in the letter but we didn’t want to do anything to prejudice our ability to deal with it.’

Yesterday a senior Cabinet Minister insisted Mr Harper had not broken the law but was holding himself to a ‘very high standard’.

Officials said Mr Harper had not broken the law because she was self-employed and so not hired directly by him.

But an immigration lawyer suggested Mr Harper could still be in line for a £5,000 fine because he failed to keep copies of the documents shown to him by his cleaner.

Barrister Colin Yeo, writing on the Free Movement blog said Mr Harper ‘may well in fact have broken the law’.

His failure to ‘take and retain copies of certain documents’ could be a breach of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.

In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister Mr Harper said that when he took on the cleaner in April 2007, for his London flat, he took a copy of her passport and a Home Office letter suggesting she had ‘indefinite leave’ to stay in Britain.

Mr Harper did nothing to check again when first made a minister in May 2010 nor when made Immigration minister in September 2012.

Last month, he looked again, and was unable to find the documents.

His cleaner gave him the documents again on February 4 but when they were checked by immigration officials they were found to be fake.

Mr Harper has been replaced by Security Minister James Brokenshire

While accepting his resignation, David Cameron left the door open for Mr Harper to return to Government.

He praised Mr Harper’s work on the Immigration Bill, and his ‘energy and loyalty’.

The PM said: ‘You will be greatly missed and I hope very much that you will be able to return to service on the Frontbench before long.’ 

Home Secretary Theresa May praised Mr Harper as an ‘excellent’ minister who could be ‘proud of the role he has played in sharply reducing immigration to Britain’.

Mr Harper has been replaced by Security Minister James Brokenshire.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show he was ‘really sad to see Mark go.’ ‘

Had he been a member of the public, I don’t think he would have done anything wrong.

But he set himself a very high standard and he failed that standard and, therefore, honourably, stood down.’

‘The new legislation is reasonably light-touch. If this had been a member of the public they would have done nothing wrong.’

Yesterday critics seized on the issue to suggest it exposed flaws in the Government’s immigration crackdown.

Labour said it should also prompt a rethink about the effectiveness of proposed new rules for landlords, employers, bankers and others to verify the status of foreign workers.

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘As immigration minister he has argued in Parliament for landlords to be required to carry out checks on every tenant, and he is responsible for the helpline for employers to ring up to double-check the immigration status of their employees.

‘We have called for the landlord scheme to be piloted, and the employer helpline to be better resourced exactly because this can be complex for employers and landlords.’

‘He has shown himself to be a decent man in his resignation and I wish him well for the future but perhaps once again the Government need to think very carefully about how they approach this issue as it’s clear there are limits to the effectiveness of relying on employer and landlord checks to address illegal immigration.’

In 2009 Labour Attorney General Baroness Scotland was fined £5,000 over her hiring of an illegal immigrant as her housekeeper - but refused to resign.

She apologised for what she called a ‘technical breach’ of failing to take copies of the documents.
