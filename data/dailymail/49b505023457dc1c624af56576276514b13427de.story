The traditional breakfasts of natives in some parts of the world  may make westerners' stomachs turn.

But raw flesh and eyeballs from freshly killed seals are everyday delicacies for Inuits living in the Arctic regions of Canada.

The Inuit diet, a consequence of habitat, consists of sea mammals including various types of seal and walrus, some plants such as seaweed and berries, and even polar bear.

Evidence shows that their extreme eating habits, while very high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates, are quite healthy.  

Eskimos, including Inuits, seem to have no incidence of breast cancer. This has been attributed to the presence of omega-3 fats in their high intake of oily fish. 

In China, a popular breakfast is the Century egg - so called because the (duck, chicken or quail) eggs are preserved in a mixture of clay, ash, salt, quicklime, and rice hulls for a long time - up to several months. 

This causes the yolk to become dark green or grey, with a creamy consistency and a scent of sulphur and ammonia, and the white to take on a dark brown shade and the form of translucent jelly with a subtle salty flavour.

The delicacy is said to have been discovered around 600 years ago during the Ming Dynasty, when a homeowner from Huhan province indulged in the duck eggs he found had been sitting in a shallow pool of slaked lime in his garden for two months.

For breakfast the Century eggs are often served with pork and rice that has been cooked similarly to risotto.

Raw crocodile eggs are a staple of the Aborigine diet and are often for sale in Australia. They are meant to taste salty and fishy. 

In Mexico a classic warming dish is menudo, a traditional soup of honeycomb tripe from the stomach of a cow and hominy, made from dried corn.

The tripe soup is cooked in a broth with a red chilli pepper base and accompanied by lime, chopped onions, coriander, crushed oregano and chillies.

The soupy concoction takes anywhere between four to seven hours to make and is usually enjoyed on special occasions. 

Alongside the honeycomb tripe it also contains libro tripe, which has a ruffled appearance and can be chewy in texture, along with beef hooves and tendons. 

Guinea pigs are a popular protein in South America and have been served as meals in Peru, Bolivia and parts of Columbia for thousands of years.

The furry animals contain more protein and less cholesterol than beef, pork or chicken.

Roasted guinea pigs are usually marinated before being slow roasted. The meat itself is said to be gamey and similar in taste to rabbit meat.
