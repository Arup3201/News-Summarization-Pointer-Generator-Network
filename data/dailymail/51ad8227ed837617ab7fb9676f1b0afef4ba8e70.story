Mohammed Karani, 44, has been jailed for 11 months after his van rolled down a steep hill and crushed a mother-of-four to death

A driver has been jailed for 11 months after his runaway van rolled down a hill and crushed a mother-of-four as she tried to protect her three young daughters.

Simran Ahmed, 46, was walking her children home from school when the Ford Transit Connect ploughed into the family in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.

Electrician Mohammed Karani, 44, left his vehicle 'in a neutral position' with the handbrake 'only partially applied' while carrying out maintenance work in a building on a notoriously steep road.

Mrs Ahmed died at the scene and her 11-year-old daughter Kiran was left with a fractured skull, Leeds Crown Court heard.

Karani from Batley, West Yorkshire, was unanimously found guilty by a jury last month of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving in April last year.

During sentencing on Thursday, Judge Christopher Batty said: 'This is a very sad day. The lives of two families were changed forever on that date in April.

'The cause of this tragic accident was the negligent way you left your vehicle before getting out of it. You had engaged the handbrake only to the second notch out of a possible six, you had not engaged a gear, you had not turned your wheels towards the kerb as advised by the Highway Code when parking.

'Of course there is no way you intended what happened or foresaw what would happen but this was a serious error.'

Mrs Ahmed's husband, Waquar Ahmed Ghafoor, said the family are appalled by the length of the sentence.

He said: 'It's absolutely shocking. We are all very disappointed that the jail sentence was not longer. I have lost a wife and all our children have lost a mother. There's no price on a life, a life is a life.

'We are all teaming up and putting a brave face on, so we are trying to be strong. But we are appalled at the judge's decision.

'The children all still have nightmares. She shielded two of my daughters and one was very badly injured. And one had to go through the pain of her dying while lying on her lap.'

The judge added: 'No sentence will ever bring Simran Ahmed back, no sentence will ever compensate her family for their immeasurable loss.'

Karani had been carrying out electrical work at the Medina Academy - an Islamic education centre - when the unattended van began to reverse down the hill, the court heard.

It picked up speed until it reached about 15mph, careering across the road and crushing Mrs Ahmed against a wall and seriously injuring her daughter.

Her other two daughters, eight-year-old Mariyam and 10-year-old Mariyah, were not seriously injured.

Garage owner Majeed Abdul, who was talking to customers on the forecourt of the garage facing the scene, described in a statement read to the court: 'I did think it was a strange manoeuvre as it was in the middle of the road. The next thing I remember was a girl screaming.'

Eyewitness Margaret Dylan, who was speaking to the garage owner, said: 'I saw the manager's facial expression and then I heard screams. I looked around and saw an adult female and two young children on the floor.

Mariyam suffered a serious injury to her leg and her father Waquar Ahmed Ghafoor says all the girl still have nightmares about the accident 

'The van was facing to the top of the hill. I am trained in first aid and primary care and I ran across the road, stopping the traffic, where I saw a female lying on on the floor with a child stood next to her.'

Prosecutor Stephen Wood said: 'There was no defect to the van in any of its systems which could have caused or contributed to the van setting off in the way it did - in other words, it was mechanically sound. The weather was fine and dry - there were no defects in the road surface.'

An investigator had later returned Karani's van to the scene and applied the brake, finding it was easily able to hold the van in position, the court heard.

The electrician had been carrying out maintenance work in a building on a notoriously steep road in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire

In evidence Karani insisted he had pulled the brake on as far as it would go which had kept the vehicle stationary for 43 minutes. He could not remember if the vehicle was left in gear but that was what he usually did.

Andrew Dallas, representing him, said he had a wife and six children who were heavily reliant on him as well as an elderly mother.

He was highly regarded in the community giving his time to the mosque and in fundraising particularly for disaster relief abroad and had expressed sincere remorse for what had happened.

Karani was also disqualified from driving for 12 months.
