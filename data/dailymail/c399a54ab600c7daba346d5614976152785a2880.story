A seven-year-old schoolgirl has written a heartbreaking letter to Santa asking for nothing but a cure for her father's serious lung disease.

Brett Wooding, 41, said he burst into tears when his daughter Skye gave him her handwritten note.

The father-of-three, from Dagenham, Essex, was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease six months ago which causes shortness of breath.

Mr Wooding has been told by his doctor he must lose weight in an effort to combat the chronic condition as he faces the prospect of relying on an oxygen machine to breathe.

Skye wrote her letter to Santa in school and handed it to her father, a former builder, when she returned home.

The note said: 'Dear Santa, I want for Christmas for my dad to get healthy and to lose weight and to get well.

'Please help my daddy.'

The primary school pupil illustrated her appeal with a drawing of her father next to two hearts.

'I was shocked when I started to read Skye's note,' said Mr Wooding, who has also got sons Tyler, nine, and Aiden, 18.

'She said "here, Dad, a card for you".

'I thought it would be a list of items to get her for Christmas but I didn't know what to say to her when I started to read it. It just broke my heart - I broke down crying.'

Brett said he didn't think Skye, his youngest child, realised just how sick he was. He was so proud of her note that he posted it on Facebook.

'We've never talked to her directly about what's wrong with me but she must have just picked it up.

'I've been in and out of the doctors and she must have heard my partner Kay and me talking about it.

'I'm just so proud of her,' said Brett, who vowed to pull out all the stops to fight to get better.

'When I put her little note up on Facebook everyone was commenting on it and saying how it had really choked them up.'

The story has emerged after Ronnie Harris, 10, of Ipswich, Suffolk, made headlines by asking Santa to cure his father, Russell Harris, 32, of a killer brain tumour.

Ronnie said he would be the 'happiest boy in the whole world' if Father Christmas could make his dream come true.

His mother, Emma Harris, 31, found the poignant letter under her son's bed - and was moved to tears with pride.

Mrs Harris, who looks after her stricken husband around the clock at home, added: 'It made me cry.

'I felt so proud of him for thinking just of his dad and wanting him better.'

She has known Mr Harris since they were three-year-olds growing up in the same neighbourhood in Ipswich.

He was diagnosed with a brain tumour eight years ago. The malignant, inoperable growth has become more aggressive and is now classed as grade four severity, leaving him critically ill and taking every day as it comes.
