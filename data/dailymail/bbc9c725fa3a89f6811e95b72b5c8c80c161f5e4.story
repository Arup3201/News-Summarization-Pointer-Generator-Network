Support for Ukip is at an all-time high after a week of sleaze in Westminster which saw Maria Miller quit over expenses and MPs accused of sexually assaulting Parliamentary aides

The Conservatives could be pushed into third place at the European elections after the party’s poll ratings plunged in the wake of the Maria Miller expenses scandal.

A poll has put the Tories on 23 per cent, behind Labour (31 per cent) and Ukip (28 per cent) just days after the Culture Secretary was forced to resign in an expenses row.

The Liberal Democrats were on a dismal 9 per cent, according to analysis of recent polling by Professor Curtice of Strathclyde University.

Levels of support for Ukip are now at a record high as they were the only party to gain popularity in a week of sleaze in Westminster, including allegations of sexual assault against young parliamentary aides.

In a Comres poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday, Labour remained steady on 35 per cent, opening up a six point lead over the Tories, while the Lib Dems reached an all-time low of just 7 per cent.

The survey comes at the end of a bad week for David Cameron, as 62 per cent thought he showed a lack of leadership over his handling of the Maria Miller expenses claims.

The Basingstoke MP stepped down from her role as Culture Secretary on Wednesday after being forced to repay £5,800 in mortgage payments and apologise to the House of Commons.

Mr Farage's performances in the head-to-head clashes with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg over Britain's future in Europe appear to have paid off, giving him a seven-point bounce in his personal ratings since last month, taking him to 27 per cent.

The Deputy Prime Minister is down one point to 12 per cent, while Prime Minister David Cameron has dropped 4 points to 27 per cent and Labour leader Ed Miliband is down 2 points to 20 per cent.

Cameron admitted on Wednesday that he had underestimated the 'raw' public anger that still exists over expenses, and this week has seen a petition launched on change.org demanding that MPs stop policing their own expenses claims.

In her petition, first-time voter Uzma Chaudhry says there isn't much 'to vote for' in modern politics, and blames expenses scandals which have 'destroyed young people's faith in politics'.

The petition has attracted almost 100,000 signatories and is one of the most popular on the website.
