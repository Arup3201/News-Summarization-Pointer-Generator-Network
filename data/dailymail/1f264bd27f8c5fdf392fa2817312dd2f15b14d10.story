The father of a popular TV sportscaster has been sentenced to 60 years for shooting dead his wife while she slept. 

Allan Kustok, 63, maintained his innocence on Wednesday in an Illinois courtroom after he was convicted of shooting wife, Anita 'Jeanie' Kustok, in the head in 2010. 

His attorneys have argued 58-year-old Mrs Kustok, a teacher, committed suicide on  September 29 in the bedroom of their home in Orland Park.

Cook County Judge John Hynes called the case one of the most baffling he's handled because Allan Kustok was 'living the American dream'.

The judge was reportedly referencing the 63-year-old's extra-marital affairs before his wife's death.  

He said Kustok was supposed to be his wife's protector 'but became her executioner'.

Kustok said in court on Wednesday that he delayed taking his wife of 34 years to the hospital after finding her body because she was beyond help and he wanted to 'say good-bye on my own terms'.

He also claimed that he didn't want a crowd of strangers in his home. The 63-year-old told the court that he had awoken that morning to the sound of a gunshot.

The couple's daughter, sportscaster Sarah Kustok, testified  she believed her father was innocent and left court without comment on Wednesday

After 90 minutes, he wrapped her body in a robe and drove her body to hospital.  

The couple's daughter, sportscaster Sarah Kustok, appeared at the sentencing hearing on Wednesday and left with comment. 

Miss Kustok works as a presenter for the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network (YES). 

She had testified in March on behalf of her father and said that she believed he was innocent. 

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the couple’s son, Zak, did not attend the hearing because he did not support his father.  

Prosecutors said during trial, that Kustok shot his wife at close range with a Magnum revolver he had given her as a wedding anniversary gift.

Defense lawyers said that he had given his wife the weapon as protection because his job often meant he was out of town. 

Judge Hynes said on Wednesday that Mrs Kustok had been a 'bright light in our community' and her death was a big loss to family and friends. 

Peggy McKain, Mrs Kustok's sister, said that their mother, Phyllis Runko, who died in 2011 spent the last year of her life with a broken heart, not knowing what happened to her daughter, the Sun-Times reported. 

Allan Kustok is planning to appeal his sentence. 

His attorney Rick Beuke said outside court: 'For the very first time in my 30-plus years doing this kind of work, I can honestly say in my heart I believe an innocent man is going to be going to the penitentiary.'
