The state of Oregon is ready to throw in the towel after nearly seven months without an Obamacare enrollment website, but not before spending $305 million in federal taxpayer dollars giving it an abortive try.

Cover Oregon seemed ready Thursday to scrap its effort and direct Oregonians to use Healthcare.gov, the perennially buggy and overloaded Health and Human Services Department website, to find and buy medical insurance.

Alex 
Pettit, the state's chief information officer, told a technical advisory board on
 Thursday that Oregon should pass operational control to the federal 
government and give up on saving its bug-ridden digital ceration.

The board could vote as early as Friday on his recommendation.

The move, first reported by the Oregonian newspaper, has brought Republican naysayers out of the woodwork with a chorus of we-told-you-sos.

The $305 million boondoggle never managed to launch an enrolment portal, despite having the same period of years to work with as other, more successful states

Cover Oregon CIO Alex Pettit told an advisory committee on Thursday that the state should drop its trouble-plagued online health exchange and have Oregonians shop for policies through the federal government's online marketplace

California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa said the news 'means federal taxpayers have lost the $305 million spent on the site. Going forward, federal officials should insist that Oregon foot the bill for the state’s transition to the federal exchange.'

The Obama administration, he said, 'needs to stop treating taxpayers as a bottomless piggy bank to bail out one botched Obamacare project after another. Poor execution by this Administration is adding billions to the cost of a program that is already too expensive..'

Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Cover Oregon 'is the poster child for what’s wrong with Obamacare’s state exchanges.'

He lashed out at Democrats, including Oregon's governor and the state's junior senator.

'it will not be lost on anyone that John Kitzhaber and Jeff Merkley were the individuals responsible for giving Oregonians Cover Oregon,' Priebus said in a statement.

Both face re-election in November.

Greg Walden, the sole Republican in Oregon's congressional delegation, said in a statement that Cover Oregon has become 'the worst financial failure in information technology in state history – and it was completely avoidable. Today's admission of failure underscores the need to stop the waste and get the truth.'

'How did this happen? Who was in charge? That's why I've sought and secured a federal investigation into Cover Oregon. Taxpayers deserve answers and demand accountability.'

Gov. John Kitzhaber, shown April 18 at an April 18 water-agreement signing ceremony between American Indian tribes and cattle ranchers, insists he never learned Cover Oregon's Obamacare portal wouldn't be functioning by Oct. 1

Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Thursday that the Obama administration should 'stop treating taxpayers as a bottomless piggy bank to bail out one botched Obamacare project after another'

Cover Oregon's PR department went all-out to sell the virtues of a state government-based insurance marketplace in a state that trends blue and where there was great enthusiasm for the Affordable Care Act.

One commercial featured a woman singing a wistful folk song while the scenery changed behind her and, at one point, a quartet of cellos provided accompaniment.

But the promise was never fulfilled.

A slide show that accompanied Pettit's remarks shows that Cover Oregon estimates an additional $78 million cost to fix the website's problems. Handing the reins to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, however, would cost between $4 and $6 million.

If the plan moves ahead, Oregon's system would become part of Healthcare.gov.

So far, four top officials have resigned as a consequence of Cover Oregon's failure to provide a single day of website up-time.

Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Cover Oregon 'is the poster child for what¿s wrong with Obamacare¿s state exchanges'

Kitzhaber ordered an independent investigation that found reports of technical roadblocks were ignored by project managers, and blames the Silicon Valley giant Oracle for site-building problems.

Oracle Global Corporate Communications chief Deborah 
Hellinger said in a statement to MailOnline that the company 'looks 
forward to providing any assistance the state needs in moving parts of 
Oregon's health care exchange to the federal system if it ultimately 
decides to do so.'

The review itself cost another $228,000 to commission from an independent outside firm.

The governor, however, has insisted that warnings about the website's problems never made it to his desk prior to the planned Oct. 1 launch.

Despite the problems, about 240,000 Oregonians managed to choose medical insurance during the six-month open enrollment period – mostly via phone or on paper. A large majority of them, 171,000, opted for taxpayer-funded Medicaid.

Cover Oregon hasn't answered questions, including MailOnline's, about whether those people will have to start all over again once the federal government assumes control.
