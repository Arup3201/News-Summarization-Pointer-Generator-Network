This is the moment an Olympic skier competing at the Sochi games had his beard shaved off for charity.

In the collection of pictures, Australian ski cross racer Anton Grimus, 23, can be seen grimacing as his impressive facial hair is removed.

The bushy beard is first trimmed with scissors, before the athlete is subjected to a slightly painful looking wet shave.

Mr Griums took part in the shave to raise money for the Rob Kneller Youth Foundation.

The organisation was started by his teammate Scott Kneller in honor of his late father.

It supports promising young skiers in Australian ski town of Jindabyne.

Mr Grimus is thought to have raised about $9,000 for the charity.

Speaking before the big event, Mr Kneller said: 'He's a very handsome guy. So I'm sure the ladies will be swooning once it comes off.'

The beard is then attacked with a razor. The skier raised around $9,000 for charity

The athlete, known as 'The Beard' in his home country for obviously reasons, had been growing his beard for two years.

The skier competed on Thursday - but crashed out of his event when he careered into a snowbank.

Moments after he bowed out of the competition - held at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park - his teammate and charity founder Mr Kneller met a similar fate.

Mr Grimus, who competed and crashed out of his event on Thursday, looks happy for the event to be over

Speaking with Fox Sports following the crash, the skier said that - other than his behind - he was in tact following his dramatic exit.

He said: 'My left glute is a bit sore but apart from that, I’m all in one piece.'

Mr Grimus grew up in  Australia, where his parents founded and an Austrian-style pension, ski hire and restaurant.
