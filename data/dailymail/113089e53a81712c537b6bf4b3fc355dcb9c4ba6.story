A former Obama health policy adviser has insisted he wants to be dead by his 75th birthday as the elderly are 'feeble, ineffectual and pathetic.'

Physicist Ezekiel Emanuel, architect of Obamacare and brother of former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, claims that longevity often comes at the expense of quality of life and the desire to live longer is 'misguided.'

Writing in the October issue of The Atlantic, he says: 'There is a simple truth that many of us seem to resist: living too long is also a loss. 

'It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. 

'It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world. 

'It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us.

'We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic. 

The father-of-three acknowledges that his desire to die in his seventies does not sit well with his family, especially his daughters, but insists he will not change his mind as his years advance.

He says that if parents live to their nineties, their children must give up their retirement time to look after them and the only time they are free is when their parents die - and they are then old themselves.

The 57-year-old, a former Obama health policy adviser, says longevity often comes at the expense of quality of life

Emanuel insists in the essay that he is not arguing for euthanasia or assisted suicide at a certain age.

He says that if he was diagnosed with cancer now he would probably have it treated, but when he turns 65 he will have his last colonoscopy and have no screening for prostate cancer at any age.

Emanuel insists that once he turns 75 he will refuse all medical treatment and says he 'die when whatever comes first takes me.'

In the essay,  which is published on the website with photos of his family, Emanuel says he will hold a memorial before his death to celebrate his life, but if his survivors want to have one when he has passed away it is not his 'business.'

Emanuel writes: 'Americans seem to be obsessed with exercising, doing mental puzzles, consuming various juice and protein concoctions, sticking to strict diets, and popping vitamins and supplements, all in a valiant effort to cheat death and prolong life as long as possible'

Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, does acknowledge that sometimes age is not a barrier to creativity.

He cites the case of a prominent health economist who recently celebrated his 90th birthday and continues to be 'brilliant', but insists that the man is simply 'an outlier—a very rare individual.'

Emanuel blasts the American obsession with 'exercising, doing mental puzzles, consuming various juice and protein concoctions, sticking to strict diets, and popping vitamins' and says he thinks the mindset is both 'misguided and potentially destructive.'

Emanuel,  told ABC's Dr. Richard Besser on This Week: 'I look at the data on disability, I look at the data on Alzheimer's disease, I look at the data on loss of creativity.

'And 75 seems to be the right moment where the chance of disability, physical disability is low, you're still not in the high Alzheimer's risk of 30 percent or 50 percent and creativity has sort of come to an end.

Emanuel, the director of the Clinical Bioethics Department at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and head of the Department of Medical Ethics & Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, helped develop President Obama's health care reform law. 

Emanuel's youngest brother is the president's first chief of staff, current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Their other brother is Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel whose clients have included Rhianna, Justin Timberlake, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. 

The three brothers were raised in Chicago by their father Israeli-born pediatrician Benjamin and mother Marsha, a nurse who was a descendant of Russian immigrants. 

They also have an adopted sister with cerebral palsy who shuns the limelight.
