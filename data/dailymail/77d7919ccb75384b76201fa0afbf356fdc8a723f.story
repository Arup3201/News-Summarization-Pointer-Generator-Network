Police charged a 20-year-old Maine man with murder on Tuesday in the death of a 15-year-old girl who was last seen more than a week ago.

Kyle Dube, of Orono, was charged in Nichole Cable's death after a body presumed to that of the girl was found in a wooded area Monday night, Maine State Police Lt. Christopher Coleman said at a news conference.

Nichole's family had said she vanished after she went to meet a Facebook friend in real life for the first time.

Tyler-Ann Harris, a 16-year-old who described herself as Nichole's best friend, said Dube and Nichole had met a couple of months earlier and planned to see each other the weekend she vanished, before he had to report to jail for a 90 day sentence for a 2012 motorcycle chase.

Harris, who met Nichole this year at Old Town High School where they were students, said she had never met Dube and wasn't sure of their relationship status.

She said Nichole wasn't fearful of him.

'She was really happy even though she went through a lot of hard stuff in her life. She always knew how to see the bright side of things,' Harris said, using a tissue to dab tears in her eyes.

'She didn't always get along with people, and she had an attitude. But that's a teenage girl. And she was just happy all the time.'

When he was charged, Dube was already in jail after turning himself in to the Penobscot County Sheriff's Department on Friday on an unrelated charge, Coleman said.

Dube’s Facebook page shows he twice posted the flier about Cable being missing last week.

The day after she went missing he reportedly posted, 'OK so I don’t with the droma. Let’s get this straight. I KYLE DUBE is and always will be with [my girlfriend]. We have had are up and downs but we have worked them out so stop talking to me if you are trying to flirt and guys you better stop hitting on [her] I get crazy when I’m pissed off and I’m about there.'

The body believed to be Nichole was found at about 9:30 p.m. Monday by a warden who was searching the woods with a dog, officials said. The exact location was not disclosed.

Although positive identification is pending, authorities believe the body is that of Nichole.

The body was being turned over to the medical examiner for positive identification and to determine a cause of death.

Nichole's mother has said that she last saw her daughter on May 12 when she said she was going out to meet someone she knew from Facebook, but didn't know who that person was.

She had pleaded for her daughter to come home, saying she won't be in trouble.

Dozens of law enforcement officers, using aircraft and dogs, and hundreds of civilian volunteers have spent days searching for the teen, who lived in Glenburn.

'This initially started as a missing person's case and sadly it's transitioned to a homicide investigation,' said Penobscot County Sheriff Glenn Ross.

The body was uncovered after an 
extensive search of the area with a helicopter and K-9 units. Before 
combing the woods, police had conducted two informational roadblocks 
between 8 p.m.

Heartbroken: Nichole's mother has released a heart-breaking plea that whomever is with her that they return her home safely or in a public place where she can call for help

Sunday and 1 a.m. Monday. Authorities
said more than 100 motorists passed through the road checks and 
provided two dozen pieces of new information for investigators.

On a Facebook page labeled Bring Nichole Cable Home, Nichole's mother, Kristine Willey, wrote, 'Please if you have
my CoCo, drop her off at a gas station or a park so she can call for 
help or for me to come get her.

'I dont care who you are, I just want her
home. She's just a little girl of 15 with her whole life ahead of her. 
Please bring her home!'

Her father had noted last week that his daughter's phone had been shut off and he had 'not heard any word from her through social media or friends.'

Cable had light brown hair and blue eyes and weighed just 90 pounds. She was a student at Old Town High School.
