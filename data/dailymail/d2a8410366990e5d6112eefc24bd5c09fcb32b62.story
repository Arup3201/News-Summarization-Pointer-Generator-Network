Grimsby Town are hoping to become the first club in the country to use a safe-standing area.

The Conference side's Blundell Park home has been all-seater since 1995.

Grimsby want to install rail seats, similar to those used in Germany and Austria, which can be unlocked or locked for either seating or standing in the Pontoon Stand.

All-seater stadiums have been compulsory in the Championship and Premier League since an inquiry into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans.

Grimsby's Blundell Park is in line to become the first stadium in England to be granted a safe-standing area

However, standing is permitted in League One, League Two and below.

Bristol City displayed a section of rail seats at Ashton Gate last year but they have since been removed because of their ongoing stadium redevelopment.

'This move is in response to the effort the young fans have made to try to improve the atmosphere of late," said stadium manager Nick Dale.

'It's also about trying to embrace modern ways of supporting football clubs and we are responding to a fans' survey carried out by the Mariners Trust, which showed there is an overwhelming desire to see us return to some terraced areas.'

Bristol City trialled a safe-standing area but they were removed once the stadium began redevelopment 

Spokesman for the Mariners Trust, Dave Roberts said: 'It's a really positive move and it shows that the club are listening to the fans.

'Supporters have clearly demonstrated that they want some sort of standing area and if we can do this, then it would be fantastic.

'It is achievable. Behind the scenes, we'll be doing lots of work to try and get local support for the project and we hope we can realise it.'

Paul Hurst's side are currently fourth in the Conference with aims to gain promotion to League Two
