A teenager has been banned from the classroom for having the same haircut as his father after teachers ruled it too 'extreme'.

Harry Farmer, 14, has been studying in school isolation for the last two weeks after getting a standard short back and sides cut but has been told he will have to stay there until it grows out. 

His father, Stacey Farmer, who has the same popular hairstyle, is concerned the Year 9 pupil is missing out on vital lessons after spending so much time away from the classroom environment.

Mr Farmer, 44, who lives in Durrington, West Sussex, with wife Julie, 39, son Harry and younger daughter Lily, said: 'This is absolute madness.'

The NHS subcontractor, who installs disability hoists, added: 'I have to be smart for my job, as I represent my company and the health service and go into homes of the elderly and vulnerable.

'I wouldn't have a hair style that wasn't smart, and I wouldn't let my son either.'

'I can't believe how long they're keeping him out of the classroom.

'He's a good boy and got lots of friends, but he even has to eat lunch on his own because the school reckon his haircut is "dangerous".' 

Chris Woodcock, the deputy head of Durrington High School, where Harry attends, is standing by the school's tough stance on so-called 'extreme' hairstyles.

He said: 'We continue to have consistent and clear expectations of all students in terms of uniform and personal presentation in school.

'Our expectations have been consistent for a number of years now and as a result of working closely with students and their parents - by confirming expectations and any specific changes in advance through letters, emails, on our website and through student planners and assemblies.

'The vast majority of students present themselves exceptionally well each and every day.'

But Mr Farmer has reprimanded the school and said the haircut is 'not extreme by any means'. 

'It's slightly longer on top and swept to one side like all the lads have,' he said. 'There's no colours, it's not like he's been running around with a Mohawk.

'He's absolutely devastated. He's always been good at school. I think he's getting to the point where he feels victimised.

'I said to the school "you're pushing him to a point he's going to turn around and rebel", but they couldn't care less.

The deputy head teacher at Durrington High School (pictured) has said they will stick by their tough uniform and personal presentation policy

'If we shave his head then it will be swapping one style for another and they'll still keep him in isolation.

'I would never let my son have an extreme hair style - I was with him when he got it cut and didn't see anything wrong with it. And I still don't.'

This year Harry will choose the subjects he wants to study for his GCSEs and will have to sit exams to decide which study groups he will be placed in for Year 10.

Mr Farmer is worried that the disruption to his son's education could have an adverse effect on his exam results.

He added: 'This is the year they are taking their options which has made me even more frustrated.

'Harry is growing up and wants to take pride in his appearance. I'm proud of him. But the school just want robots, everyone to be exactly the same and to conform.'
