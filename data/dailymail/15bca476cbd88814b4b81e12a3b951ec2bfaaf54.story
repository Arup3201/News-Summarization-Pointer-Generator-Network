A seven months-pregnant woman whose baby was cut from her womb made a desperate 911 call after the brutal attack on Wednesday pleading for help as she was 'bleeding out'.

The 26-year-old, identified at one point by the dispatcher as Michelle, spoke faintly on the six-minute call: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.'

The woman was able to give the dispatcher the address of the home in Longmont, Colorado where she had been attacked, adding that she was in the basement and had locked the door. She has multiple wounds, she said, and that the attacker broke a glass and stabbed her in the neck.

The 911 dispatcher pressed her for the attacker's name and the woman responded that she didn't know the assailant and had gone to her home answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes. She added: 'I was trying to leave.'

Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, allegedly stabbed the 26-year-old in the stomach and pulled out the baby, killing the fetus in the process, police said on Thursday. The mother survived the attack.

Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, allegedly stabbed the 26-year-old in the stomach and pulled out the baby, killing the fetus in the process. She had lured the victim to her Colorado home using a Craigslist ad for baby clothes

Lane, 34, who is married and has two daughters, was driven to hospital by her husband following the horrific attack where she reportedly told staff she had a miscarriage

According to this online profile, Dynel Lane had registered for baby gifts and boy's clothing and noted her due date as November 14, 2014

The dispatcher repeatedly reassured the victim that help was on the way and when her voice began to fade away, she urged her: 'You stay with me, don't go to sleep.'

Police rushed to the scene and could hear the victim calling for help inside the home. An officer found the victim in the basement. 

Lane had left the house when police arrived. 

The victim was taken to Longmont United Hospital where she underwent surgery and is expected to recover. The baby did not survive the attack.  

Longmont police Cmdr Jeff Satur told Daily Mail Online that the female suspect was taken to hospital by her husband. 

Lane was reportedly carrying the victim's dead baby and telling hospital staff that she had suffered a miscarriage. The husband is not a suspect, the police chief said. 

ABC7 reported that the husband believed his wife had suffered a miscarriage. Police would not comment on whether the suspect had recently been pregnant. 

Comments on Lane's social media referred to a pregnancy last year. 

A relative said on Thursday that Lane had lost a child of her own more than a decade ago when he accidentally drowned.

Lane's son was 19 months old in 2002, when he drowned in a shallow pond at the home of her parents near Pueblo, Colorado. Investigators at the time ruled the death an accident.

Lane and her now ex-husband were devastated by the child's death, said Aaron Cruz, the boy's paternal grandfather. The couple had two daughters together and had been trying for a boy. 

A July 2002 obituary for Lane's son, Michael Alexander Cruz, in the Pueblo Chieftan said the boy loved playing with his sisters, cousins and friends and had just learn to sing his first song, Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.

Lane's then-husband wasn't home at the time of the drowning, the newspaper reported at the time. She and their two daughters, then five and three, searched for the boy until they found him in the fish pond.

He had been playing a game with his sisters while their mother was busy in another part of the house, the newspaper said.

Lane also lost her grandmother earlier this month, according to her social media posts.  

According to social media, Lane had remarried and was assistant manager at a franchise of a company, Once Upon A Child, which buys and sells 'gently-used' children's clothing.

KDVR reported on Wednesday that a baby registry was set up in Lane's name last year and listed her due date as November 14, 2014. The clothing in the baby registry was for a boy. 

Public records revealed that Lane held a certified license as a nurse aide which expired in 2012. 

After speaking to the victim, police were able to arrest Lane at the hospital at 7.46pm on Wednesday.

Lane was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault, and child abuse knowingly and recklessly resulting in death, the Boulder District Attorney's Office confirmed on Thursday.

Police are looking for any other mothers who may have responded to Lane's ad for baby clothes. 

A seven months' pregnant woman had her baby cut from her womb by another woman in a horrific attack which killed the fetus at this home in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday

Police said the 34-year-old woman who lives at the home stabbed the pregnant woman and 'removed' her baby. An armed officer outside the property in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday afternoon 

Police hoped to gain access to the home on Wednesday night using a search warrant. Investigators said they have an 'idea' of the motive of the attack but were not ready to release it until charges are filed

Under Colorado law, the charges are complicated by the fact if a child was not  born alive, then homicide charges could not be brought. The Boulder County DA's office does not expect to file charges until next week.

Investigators have not released the name of the suspect or the pregnant woman but said they did not know each other. 

The 26-year-old mother-to-be had gone to the home alone to answer the Craigslist ad in Longmont, a town 30 miles outside Denver.

Police entered the suspect's home on Wednesday night after obtaining a search warrant.

They hoped the search will better explain what motivated the suspect to engage in such a crazed attack.

'This is a tragic case for a mother right now,' Cmdr Satur told Fox 31 Denver. 'She came by this house. She was attacked, and her baby was removed from her.'

The alleged assailant has two daughters, Commander Satur said. Her husband apparently drove her and the fetus to the hospital.

Lane is scheduled to appear at the Boulder County Jail at 2pm on Thursday.

It was not known whether the victim had any other children.
