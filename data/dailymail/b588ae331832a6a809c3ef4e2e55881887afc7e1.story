A senior Conservative MP has been slammed for spending  £2,270 of taxpayers' money on black dresses for work.

Eleanor Laing bought two frocks and a jacket for her role as deputy House of Commons speaker, filling in for John Bercow when he is not in the Chamber chairing MPs' debates.

Other senior politicians, including the Prime Minister David Cameron have to buy their own clothes for work. 

Deputy House of Commons speaker Eleanor Laing has been criticised for spending more than £2,000 on two dresses for her role in Parliament

But Ms Laing, whose salary is £103,420, charged the cost of her outfits to the taxpayer, according to the Sun newspaper.

Her bill was nearly double that spent on two ornate costumes for the Associate Serjeant-at-Arms, which cost £1,282.50.

Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said people would be 'shocked' by the extortionate cost. 

He said: 'Few begrudge costumes but it is unreasonable for the public to pay for clothes that can be worn outside the Commons.'

But a Commons spokesman defended the expenditure. He said: 'The items for the Deputy Speaker are expected to last for a number of years.'

Ms Laing paid back £25,000 in the expenses scandal after anger that she sold her state-funded second home for a £1million profit without paying capital gains tax.

She was elected as one of the three deputy Commons Speakers in October last year.

The Conservative MP for Epping Forest beat six other challengers for the right to fill in for Speaker John Bercow in his absence.

There had been a vacancy on Mr Bercow's team since Nigel Evans stood down to fight sex offence charges for which he was later cleared.

The deputy Speaker's position carries a salary premium of £36,360 in addition to the standard MPs' salary.

Ahead of the election, Ms Laing had said: 'I'm passionate about freedom through democracy, about the dignity of the House of Commons, and about its vital, essential role as a forum for national debate.

'I would like to be part of the Speaker's team, not just to keep order in the chamber but to stand up for the rights of the backbenches... against overbearing governments.'
