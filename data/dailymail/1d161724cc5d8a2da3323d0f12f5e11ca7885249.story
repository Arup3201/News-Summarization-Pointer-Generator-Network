Rumours about Huawei’s fitness band and headphones leaked before this year’s Mobile World Congress, but one wearable that surprised many was its first smartwatch.

The Huawei Watch is powered by Android Wear, has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in heart rate monitor.

The crown, frame and hinge are made of scratch-resistant stainless steel and there will be 40 watch faces to choose from when it launches.

The watch will be available later this year across Europe, Asia and the US although the exact date and price information hasn't been announced.

Huawei has a range of wearables including the TalkBand B1, the new B2 and the N1 headphones but this is the Chinese firm’s first smart watch.

The 1.4-inch display has a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels, giving it a 286 pixel-per-inch density.

By comparison, the Moto 360 which also has a circular screen and has a PPI of 205.

PPI is an indicator of image sharpness, clarity and colour and the higher the number, the better.

Huawei’s watch pairs with any Android phone running 4.3 and above.

Multi-tasker: And in addition to the heart rate monitor, the watch has six-axis motion sensor and barometer that automatically detects and tracks in real-time if a user is walking, running, biking, hiking or sleeping

Once connected, notifications received on the phone are also shown on the watch including texts, emails, meetings, calls and Facebook posts, and more.

It runs on a Qualcomm 1.2GHz processor, includes 4GB of storage, 512MB of RAM and is Bluetooth enabled.

And in addition to the heart rate monitor, the watch has six-axis motion sensor and barometer that automatically detects and tracks in real-time if a user is walking, running, biking, hiking or sleeping.

Specifically, users can monitor the number of calories burned, heart rate, climbing height, steps taken, and distance travelled.

MailOnline’s Victoria Woollaston reveals her first impressions of the Huawei Watch:

‘There is a plethora of smartwatches at this year’s Mobile World Congress - and with Apple expected to launch its version on Monday, there are likely to be even more released in the coming months.

However, many don’t feel as luxurious at Huawei’s model.

The entire crown, frame and hinge are made of steel which makes it feel expensive, sturdy and most importantly, makes it look like a watch.

The screen is bright and clear, but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this.

There will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and I can see it being popular with both sexes. Previous watches such as the Moto 360 feel more masculine, for example.

Huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success, but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch I’ve seen.'

The firm didn’t reveal battery life details but said that the timepiece (pictured) would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with device. Exact availability and pricing is yet to be announced

‘We have responded to consumers’ requests from around the world asking for a smartwatch featuring a timeless design that is truly smart from within,’ said Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei Consumer Business Group.

‘As the first smartwatch in our expanding line of premium wearable products, the Huawei Watch was designed and created to enhance and be part of the consumer’s everyday lives.’

Huawei continued the watch is made using 130 components and the steel is what’s known as ‘cold-forged’ making it 40 per cent stronger than standard steel.

When the watch goes on sale it will be available in gold, silver and black and will have an interchangeable strap.

The firm didn’t reveal battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device.

The watches (illustrated) will have sapphire crystal screens and a choice of 40 faces for the user

Huawei Watch will be available in more than 20 countries including United States, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates.

Exact availability and pricing is expected to be announced at a future date in each of these regions separately.

Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble told MailOnline: ‘2015 is set to be the biggest year yet for high-tech wrist candy, and Huawei’s smart watch is one of the most beautiful so far, if chunky timepieces are your thing.

‘Its sapphire crystal screen, 40 watch faces, and a rather classy optional leather strap make it all too easy to forget that it’s what’s inside that really counts.

‘4GB of internal storage and 512MB of RAM are rumoured to be exactly what the Apple Watch will offer.

‘It looks as though we already have an Apple Watch killer, or at least an arch nemesis powered by Android, on the scene.’
