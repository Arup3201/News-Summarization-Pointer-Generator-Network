Groups of vigilantes armed with guns, handcuffs and bulletproof vests are patrolling the Texas state border with Mexico in a radical new attempt to keep migrants from crossing the Rio Grande.

Since early summer a group naming themselves the Patriots have patrolled an area near Brownsville, Texas.

One 25-year-old member, who only gave the name Will, patrols the area each day carrying binoculars, an assault rifle and a Glock pistol.

The construction worker, originally from Indiana, said: 'If you spot them (the migrants) and shine your light on them, that lets them know that you're there.

'Nine times out of 10, they're not going to come over. Even if they are going to try to cross again, we're still making it harder for them, and that's the reason we're here.'

The Patriots Information Hotline, a networking call center, estimates that 22 groups of 'armed patriots' have sprung up along the border from Texas to California this year.

With names like Patriots and Citizen Defenders, the groups often set up camp on private land along the border at a property owner's invitation.

Expenses are generally paid by members, though some funds come from like-minded donors.

To critics, they are militias - vigilantes spoiling for a fight. For would-be migrants, they are another barrier to entry.

For the U.S. Border Patrol, they can be either a nuisance or a help in spotting people trying to enter the country illegally.

The groups insist that their presence is unrelated to the tens of thousands of children from Central America who flooded across the border with Mexico earlier this year.

The Patriots claim their efforts are essential because the U.S. government has failed to secure the border. They bristle at the terms 'militia' and 'vigilante'.

'Everybody has this bad taste in their mouth about 'militias. They think we're out here trying to smoke people and kill them as soon as they cross the border. Which obviously, is not the case,' said a member who only gave the name 'Huggie Bear'.

'Our goal here is to try to deter them from coming. They see us, they don't know who we are, so that kind of scares people away for a while.'

The Patriots operate on 21 acres of land owned by Rusty Monsees, whose family has had a ranch on the border since the 1940s.

They patrol in body armor, riding all-terrain vehicles that drown out the sound of cicadas at night.

Mr Monsees, 66, said 'illegals' have poisoned his dogs and sprayed his yellow house with bullets, but he refuses to leave.

The Patriots carry plastic handcuffs to detain border crossers and communications equipment to inform Border Patrol.

However, some say it is just a matter of time before one of the vigilante border patrol groups sparks a deadly firefight.

Eddie Guerra, sheriff of the Texas border county of Hidalgo, said: 'When there are situations with any individual who is bearing arms in public or on private property, there is always a concern amongst law enforcement of possible misidentification that can lead to friendly-fire tragedies.'

Border Patrol has warned the groups that taking matters into their own hands could have 'disastrous personal and public safety consequences.'

Many in Brownsville live in the shadow of an 18-foot-high rust-colored steel barrier that stretches hundreds of miles along the border.

A few, including Fernando Rivera Jr., have called on groups like the Patriots to keep an eye on their properties.

'Whoever says there's not a problem by the border wall, they don't live out here,' he said.

He added that his son walks around the backyard with a shotgun slung over his back to protect the family from what he says are criminals coming across the border.

In addition to the Monsees' property, the Patriots monitor homes in the area at the request of owners like Rivera, who said it can take up to 45 minutes for a county sheriff to arrive after a call for help.

'Now, when they're on patrol, it's actually peaceful,' he said. 'The dogs don't bark as much. I can actually get some sleep.'
