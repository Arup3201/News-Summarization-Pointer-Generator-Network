Jason Wilson, 35, has been jailed for 18 months at Birmingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to attacking 21-year-old Ashley Madden on a bus

A 'barbaric' thug who admitted attacking a bus passenger because he complained about children throwing sweets at him has been jailed.

Jason Wilson, 35, was on the number 24 bus in Birmingham City Centre with his partner, Laura Breckneall, 34, her 10-year-old son and her daughter, when 21-year old Ashley Madden asked the children to stop throwing sweets at him.

The court heard that Wilson then walked to the back of the bus, sat next to Mr Madden and spat in his face.

In full view of the children, Wilson punched and kicked Mr Madden, jumping up on the seats to get a better angle. Ms Breckneall passed Wilson a bottle of Jif lemon juice which he squirted in Mr Madden's eyes.

She was initially arrested but all charges against her were dropped at a later hearing.

'Shocking' CCTV footage of the seven minute attack, which included kicks, knees and punches, was shown to Birmingham Crown Court today.

Mr Madden had to be taken to hospital after the attack and was left with a bruised nose, swelling and bruising to his left eye, and breathing difficulties.

Jailing Wilson for 18 months Recorder Martine Kushner said: 'What I saw on the screen was truly, truly shocking.

'A child needs boundaries, he doesn't need to see an assault being carried out by the person who looks after him. You could have just moved away.

'The next thing you could have done was go over to the child and explain to him not to do that, but that is not what you did.

'There is some degree of thought to incapacitate the victim and you go back again and again four times.Â

Wilson attacked Mr Madden on the number 24 bus in January, punching and kicking him before squirting lemon juice into his eyes

The attack took place after Mr Madden asked the children Wilson was looking after to stop throwing sweets

The court heard that Wilson walked over to Mr Madden and spat in his face before hitting him

'You use the handles of the seat to get the maximum force. There may have not been much harm but you had absolutely no care what the effect was going to be.

'This was a violent attack in a pubic place, in the middle of a bus, in the middle of an afternoon.

'All I can do is give you a custodial sentence. Anybody who sees the CCTV would think it is significantly serious.'

Officers from West Midlands Police released the minute-long video taken by CCTV cameras in February - which led to a flood of people naming Wilson as the attacker.

He then eventually handed himself into a police station on February 20.

The attack was watched by Mr Wilson's girlfriend, Laura Breckneall, 34, and her two children - a son, aged 10, who suffers from ADHD and Asperger's and a daughter

After the attack Mr Madden was taken to hospital with bruising to his nose and eye and breathing difficulties

During the attack Ms Breckneall even passed Wilson a bottle of lemon juice which he squired in Mr Madden's eyes

Pleased: Mr Madden smiled as he left Birmingham Crown Court following the verdict today

Prosecutor Claire Harris told the court: 'Just after 4.30pm the complainant Ashley Madden had got on the number 24 bus by the new library in the city centre and sat on the top deck intending to travel to Quinton.

'The defendant also got on with his partner and her two children. One of the children who was 10-years-old was throwing sweets over his shoulder.

'Ashley Madden asked this defendant, who he assumed was with the boy, to stop throwing the sweets.

'The defendant then made his way over to him and spat in his face.

'Ashley Madden's reaction was to punch him, but it was then that an extreme amount of violence was used on this complainant who was essentially trapped in the corner.

'He is a big man and his punched, he kicked. The assault was prolonged and sustained.

Wilson admitted assault occasioning ABH at an earlier hearing at Birmingham Crown Court

Police initially released CCTV in February when Wilson and Laura Breckneall were quickly identified. Ms Breckneall was originally arrested and charged, but the charges were dropped at an earlier hearing

'The defendant went off and came back for more. On one occasion he lifts himself up off the floor and kicks the defendant in the face and then he squirted lemon juice in his face.

'It was used in order to blind the complainant and to degrade him. There was also an attempt to take his mobile phone in an attempt to prevent him from calling the police.'

In Wilson's defence, Michael Garrett said: 'He completely lost his self control, he admitted that in interview. The red mist came down and he lost it.

'He makes no excuse for his conduct at all. It is an aggravating feature.'
