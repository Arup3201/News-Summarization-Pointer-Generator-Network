An army of 100 green-fanged spiders the size of tablespoons have invaded a young family's home.

Dan Jackson and his three-year-old son Ruben are scared to go outside as 'tube web spiders' have filled every hole and crack in their garden and walls.

The black creatures with shiny green fangs sew distinctive tube-shaped webs inside cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands.

Now Mr Jackson, 29, is worried they may get into his house and harm his son, as their bites can cause a sharp injection-like pain.

The spiders' bite causes a painful stinging sensation that lasts for hours. Pictured is one of the spiders nesting to the outside of Mr Jackson's home

The online trader from Southampton said: 'I'm not scared of spiders but even I'm freaked out by these ones.

'I first saw one when I went out into my garden and didn't think much of it.

'But when it got dark they all came out and there must have been more than 50 of them.'

The official name for the spider is the Segestria florentina. While the pain from a bite can last for hours, their venom has no lasting effect on people.

They are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps.

Females reach a body length of up to 22mm and males up to 15mm.

Mr Jackson said: 'My home backs onto woods so I think that must be where they have all come from.

Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm.

Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year.

They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours.

They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it.

Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique.

'I saw one that was the size of a tablespoon and I also managed to catch one after I saw it rush across my fence and then jump off onto the ground.

'It was playing dead and my brother said it was only a bit of dirt, but I put a glass over it and moved it a bit and it shot up.

'I let it go and it moved off so quickly it was unbelievable. As I said I'm not scared of spiders but these made me jump!

'I don't really know what I am going to do about them, but I know they bite so I worry about Ruben.

'I will have to speak to the council or get and exterminator out.'

Sightings of the spiders have been more common in recent weeks as they usually occur from June to November.

Tube web spiders are thought to have arrived in Britain around a century ago from the Mediterranean.
