Leicester City are making a move for Feyenoord’s £8million-rated striker Graziano Pelle.

The Italian scored 23 goals in 28 games last season and has been watched by a host of Premier League scouts with QPR, West Brom, Stoke and Everton among those to have taken a closer look.

Wanted: Leicester City are set to make a move for Feyernoord striker Graziano Pelle

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has been frustrated in his efforts to sign Leonardo Ulloa from Brighton.

The Championship side, who have announced Sami Hyypia as their new boss, have been asking £8million for the Argentine as they look to build a promotion chasing side for next season.

Pearson has concerns up front with David Nugent yet to sign a new deal and wants a striker who can handle the physical side of the Premier League also.

Pelle is 6ft 4ins yet mobile and would relish the chance to move to England. He is chasing wages of around £3million a year but may be willing to take a cut to get the right move.

The overall deal may still be too rich for Leicester but talks are expected over the coming days.
