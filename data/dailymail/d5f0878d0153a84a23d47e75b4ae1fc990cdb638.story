David Cameron has pledged to support women who stay at home and raise children

David Cameron has pledged to support women who stay at home to raise children, fuelling hopes that he will act on his promise to recognise marriage in the tax system.

The Prime Minister has come under fire from stay-at-home mothers after excluding them from new childcare plans.

He was also criticised for stopping child benefit for families living off a single salary at a lower income level than those with two wage earners.

But he denied ministers were trying to force mothers back to work.

Mr Cameron also signalled that he was preparing to dilute controversial plans to increase the number of children a childminder can look after, following opposition from his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg.

The Prime Minister said he did not agree with Business Secretary Vince Cable that there was ‘prejudice’ against stay-at-home mothers.

He added: ‘I support the choices mums make. If they want to work we should support that, and if they want to stay at home we should support that. The idea is not to dictate to people what they should do, but to support the choices they make.

‘There are lots of things we do that help stay-at-home mums. The support we’re giving for nursery education is a good example.’

His words will encourage Tory MPs and ministers who are lobbying him to fulfil his promise to create a marriage tax break. Speculation is mounting that George Osborne may bring in a modest tax break in his autumn statement.

But some Tories believe it will come too late to take effect before the next election in 2015.

The Prime Minister also suggested he was willing to compromise over the Coalition’s childcare plans after Mr Clegg withdrew his support at the last moment.

Ministers were planning to relax the rules on the number of children childminders and nursery staff can care for. But in a late change of heart this month, Mr Clegg said he had serious concerns about the plans, which would allow nursery staff to look after six two-year-olds.

This enraged Education Secretary Michael
Gove, who accused Mr Clegg of blocking the plans to bolster his 
position as Lib Dem leader.

Mr Clegg’s U-turn followed an embarrassing phone-in on his LBC radio show in March, when he was harangued by barrister and mother-of-two Laura Perrins.

The 32-year-old, who gave up her legal career to look after her children, told him many traditional families felt discriminated against by the announcement that working parents only would receive a tax break of up to £1,200 per year to cover soaring childcare costs.

Mrs Perrins, from the group Mothers At Home Matter, said ministers viewed her choice as ‘worthless’.

Yesterday, Mr Cameron said it was pointless getting frustrated with Mr Clegg’s change of tack, adding: ‘Trying to get quality affordable childcare is a priority for the Government. The proposals we put forward had a lot of merit.

‘Clearly there now needs to be a discussion in the Coalition about how best to go forward.

‘There’s no point getting too frustrated. We’ll find a way forward that I hope will be good for people who want affordable childcare.’

From September, the ratio for under-ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four. Each adult would also be able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. The ratio for three-year-olds would remain unchanged.

Tory sources claim this would cut nursery costs by around £1,300 a year without compromising quality. But the plans were criticised by childminders and mothers.
