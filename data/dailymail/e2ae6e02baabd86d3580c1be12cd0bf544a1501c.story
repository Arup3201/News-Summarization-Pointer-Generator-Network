The Sierra Leone sprinter claiming asylum in the UK because he says his family have died from Ebola, has been branded an 'embarrassment' by one of the country's top sporting officials.  

Jimmy Thoronka, 20, was found living rough on the streets of south London having not returned home after the conclusion last summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

He claims all his family in his west African homeland have succumbed to Ebola, including his adoptive mother Jelikatu Kargbo.

But the runner's story, which has prompted an outpouring of public support, has been contradicted by Joseph Nyande, secretary general of Sierra Leone's National Olympics Committee.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Nyande said: 'He absconded. We had that embarrassment. 

Jimmy Thoronka, 20, was found living rough on the streets of south London having not returned home since competing in the 4x100-metre relay at last summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

'It happened in the 2012 Olympic games and when we went to Glasgow. I don't think there's anything wrong with his parents.'

Months after disappearing having competed in the 4x100-metre relay in Glasgow, Thoronka was found on the street having outstayed his visa, though he was not claiming benefits and was short of money and food.

He is living in Home Office accommodation near Heathrow having been arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. 

He was released and has now officially claimed asylum.

But  Abdul Karim Sesay, the vice-president of the National Olympics Committee in Sierra Leone and president of the country's athletics association, told the Guardian he backed Thoronka's story, saying Ms Kargbo did indeed die of Ebola in October. 

The sprinter has been branded an 'embarrassment' for 'absconding' and not returning home to west Africa

A pair of Sierra Leone Olympic officials have given two completely different accounts of Thoronka's plight

He said: 'The story about Jimmy failing to return to Sierra Leone is a big one and it is very embarrassing for the National Olympics Committee and I believe that is why there has been this attack on Jimmy. 

'I and other members of the National Olympics Committee will be calling a press conference to refute the claims made by Joseph Nyande.'

Thoronka said he was confused about what was happening.

'Two National Olympics Committee people are telling me two different things,' he said. 

'If it can be proved that my adopted mother Jelikatu Kargbo is still alive and can continue to support me that will be very good. 

An online petition  to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted nearly 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete

'I would be very happy to speak with her again but I have been told that she is dead and I have no family left.

'If I go home, I will have no one to help me. If they can find my adopted mother and bring her to me, I will be very happy but I think some people are trying to destroy me. 

'If Joseph Nyanda is saying that my family are alive, where are they? Please can he bring them to me.'  

Thoronka has said he wants to claim asylum in the UK to fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete but now faces deportation.

An online petition appealing to the authorities to let him remain in the UK has so far attracted more nearly 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete.

Among the high profile names to support him in his plight are supermodel Lily Cole and comedian Russell Brand.
