The 'Baby Dolls' marched through the streets of New Orleans during Mardi Gras last week with hardly any of the throng lining the streets having any idea of the seedy truth behind the tradition.

The history Baby Dolls spans more than a century, and began with the African-American women working in the red light district in Storyville.

The Baby Dolls came together around 1912, as the word ‘baby’ began its run as both a term of endearment and a condescending slight toward women working as prostitutes.

In the early 20th century, their costumes included stockings with garters, short silk or satin dresses, and of course, bonnets. 

But it was their brazen behavior that really drew attention to themselves during the parade.

But a century later, the group is also comprised of African American men, according to Dr Kim Vaz, the dean at Xavier University.

Dr Vaz, the author of a book chronicling the dolls’ history, told NPR that during the age of Jim Crow laws, black people were still disenfranchised, as there were different laws for how black and white red-light districts could legally operate. 

When the women in the black district discovered that their rivals were going to dress up for the Mardi Gras parade, they decided they needed to outdo them.

Dr Vaz told NPR: ‘They said, “Let’s just be baby dolls because that’s what the men call us. They call us baby dolls, and let’s be red hot.”’

She also explained that their provocative name had a double meaning. ‘African-American women weren’t considered precious and doll-like,’ she said.

Mardi Gras celebrations date from the city’s French founding in 1718.

The Baby Dolls had an important role in post-Katrina Louisiana as well. A group called the 504 Eloquent Baby Dolls of New Orleans formed, named in part for a telephone area code.

They marched with the tribe of Mardi Gras Indians, as well as the Skull and Bones club.

The Louisiana Weekly, the newspaper of the New Orleans black community, identified the Million Dollar Baby Dolls in 1939 as among the city's oldest African-American masking groups, Dr Vaz told the Associated Press last month.

The earliest known photographs of baby doll maskers are cells from a 1931 film that doesn't make clear whether they were prostitutes or mainstream revellers.

'Even today, those in the Baby Boom generation recall their mothers and grandmothers warning them against the lewd and lascivious behavior evidenced by many a Baby Doll on Carnival Day,' Dr Vaz wrote in her book, ‘The Baby Dolls: Breaking the Race and Gender Barriers of the New Orleans Mardi Gras Tradition.’

The first of the current baby doll troupes apparently started in the 1980s, when Merline Kimble and friends revived her grandparents' Gold Digger Club of baby doll maskers. 

The late Antoinette K-Doe created the group named for her husband, Ernie K-Doe, in 2003 with friends including Reed, Trepagnier and praline store owner 'Tee-Eva' Perry.
