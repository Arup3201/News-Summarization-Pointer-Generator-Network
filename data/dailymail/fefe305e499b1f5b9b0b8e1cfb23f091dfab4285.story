Gurning for the camera clearly isn't anything new if these fascinating photographs from over 100 years ago are anything to go by.

The newly unearthed pictures from the Northumberland Archives at Woodhorn Museum, in Ashington, prove that our ancestors enjoyed messing around in front of the camera as much as we do. 

From moustachioed gentlemen to laughing ladies and cheeky children, the images show that the notion of those from a bygone era being prim and proper isn't quite true.

Gurning: Newly unearthed pictures from the Northumberland Archives at Woodhorn Museum, in Ashington, prove that our ancestors enjoyed messing around in front of the camera as much as we do

In just this small sample of pictures from the collection a family can be seen enjoying a bizarre day out at a gallows known as Winter's Gibbet, on Steng Cross, in Elsdon, Northumberland.

In another photo rows and rows of youngsters are pictured sat up in their beds on Friday May 28, 1926, with the staff of Stannington Sanitorium near Morpeth.

The children are pictured under a sign reading 'Happiness' apparently awaiting a visit from the Duke of York who would 10 years later become King George VI.

And perhaps the most fascinating set of images are the series of Northumbrian natives making odd faces for the camera - although the date of these pictures is not known.

Labour of love: Chris Wild, founder of Retronaut, spent a year assembling the pictures - which will be exhibited from September 27

Technical matter: Mr Wild said that in the late 1800s the long exposure times meant that holding a smile was quite difficult, so people tended to have a blank expression

The collection has been compiled by the museum and Chris Wild - who founded the past pictures website Retronaut.

He has spent the past year mining the photographic collection of the Woodhorn Museum and Northumberland Archives for fascinating treasure trove which will be exhibited from September 27.

Mr Wild, 44, from Oxfordshire, said: 'I started Retronaut four years ago. Ever since I was a young boy, I have wanted to go back in time.

'When I was working in museums, I started to see early colour photographs. These photographs didn't look like "the past", the colour made them look like "now" - but another version of now.

Fun factor: Mr Wild explained that those from the Victorian era did clown around in the front of the camera - it was just harder to capture it

These pictures of children were taken by a Northumbrian photographer visiting the Low Countries and shows the fascinating traditional dress of women in the Netherlands

Smiles better: While the main subjects of this picture, taken in the Netherlands, hold serious expressions, the two women to the side see a funny side to the situation

'These pictures gave me the closest experience to time-travel I had had. I started to collect them, and other pictures that had a similar effect. The collection became Retronaut.'

Mr Wild said the photographs of people pulling faces in the archive were perhaps the most fascinating aspect of his research.

He said: 'The exposure time for a photograph in the late 1800s is several seconds - very long by modern standards, but miniscule compared to the first photograph, taken in 1827 and with an exposure of several days.

'Still, that several-second exposure meant that the subject had to stand very still.

'Holding a smile was too difficult, and would either look very false and fixed - or would blur.

'So people posed with blank and unsmiling faces. Much as we are asked to do for passport pictures today.

'If someone a hundred years from now was to judge our temperament from our passports alone, they would conclude we were serious, stilted and stiff.

'We are not, but the passport medium records us that way. In the same way, the Victorians were recorded as serious, stilted and stiff - but that is the medium we are describing, not the people. Victorians clowned around - it was just harder to record that photographically.

'The most interesting thing to me about this archive is that there is nothing especially interesting about it.

'It is a typical British county archive collection - in other words, something that most people will not think about very much, unless they are researching their family tree.

'I wanted to show that archives and museums are the custodians of all our fragments of time. And that those fragments can be very arresting and engaging, when cast in the right light.

'Retronaut has come to mean anachronistic images - pictures which don't fit with the way we think of the past.

'And because of this way of selecting images, they usually are very engaging, and create online traffic for their source.

An unknown group of women pose for an undated photograph, with one clearly keen to show of her chunky hairbrush 

Staff of Stannington Sanitorium near Morpeth scrubbed this ward to within an inch of its life. The beneficiary of this frenzied activity was the Duke of York, who just over 10 years later would become King George VI. The children all posed for a photograph under a sign that read 'Happiness'

Bizarre: A family day out in the early 20th century at a former hanging post known as Winter's Gibbet, on Steng Cross, Elsdon, Northumberland. Named after one William Winter who was hanged at Newcastle's Westgate in 1792 for murder and whose body was subsequently displayed as a warning to all 

'In other words, Retronaut is like a shop window for archives. I want that to continue, and for Retronaut to be able to show more of the world's archival wonders in its window.'

Keith Merrin, director of Museums and Archives Northumberland, said the Retronaut project was very important.

He said: 'Archives remain one of the best kept secrets of the heritage sector. They contain amazing records covering all aspects of life in the communities around the UK but many people are unsure how to access them or what they contain.

'At Woodhorn and our other museums in Northumberland we have a brilliant track record of enthusing people about their local history and we are keen to find new ways of making sure that our archive collections can also reach the widest possible audience.

'Through his Retronaut work Chris has established himself as a world leader in terms of bringing archives to audiences that otherwise would never see them.

'These audiences are often younger and more comfortable searching the digital world.'

Mr Wild will work with archivists from Museums and Archives Northumberland to explore its collections and help the organisation reach new audiences.

It is hoped that a physical exhibition curated by The Retronaut will take place at Woodhorn in 2014.

Retronaut's first book has just been published by National Geographic.

Hot look: This picture was taken in July 1896 and despite the warm weather, the subject donned a thick skirt and heat-trapping frilly top
