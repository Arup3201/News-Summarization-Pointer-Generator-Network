Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart has hailed the brilliance of Sergio Aguero - although he claims he is 'useless' in training.

City's star striker Aguero underlined his return to form this season with a superb four-goal demolition of Tottenham on Saturday.

Aguero scored all the goals as the champions won 4-1 at the Etihad Stadium in the Barclays Premier League, taking his tally for the campaign to 10 in all competitions.

Argentina international Aguero has already notched nine goals in the Premier League this season 

That included four during the demolition of Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham Hotspur at the Etihad Stadium

It also made the Argentinian City's record goalscorer in the Premier League with 61 and took him to 85 goals in 132 appearances for the club overall.

It was an emphatic reminder of the 26-year-old's talents now that the muscle injuries which hampered him during the latter half of last season and the World Cup appear behind him.

Hart said: 'He is one of those players - and I don't think he will be unhappy with me saying it - that some days you look at him in training and he is useless!

'That is just down to him, and you know that when it comes to games he is going to score, because he is that talented, that good a player.

'He is a big-match player and deserves to be at a big club like this, scoring goals for these fans, and I can't be positive enough about him. He deserves all the plaudits he gets.

'Finishing-wise he is one of the best and his goals-to-games ratio in the Premier League is the best.'

Aguero's statistics in that regard are certainly impressive.

His 61 Premier League goals have come in 95 appearances and he averages a goal every 108.3 minutes, according to Opta.

That is the most clinical ratio in Premier League history, ahead of Thierry Henry (121.8) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (128.2) - although both of them played many more minutes.

Hart said: 'He still has a lot of work to do. He is only young and hopefully, if we keep him fit, he will be pushing on.'
