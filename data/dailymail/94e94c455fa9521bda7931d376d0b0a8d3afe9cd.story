In the film, she was a tough-talking, no-nonsense detective with little patience for personal grooming as she brought down violent criminals.

Now
in a case of life imitating art, a former undercover police officer has
inadvertently mimicked the character played by Sandra Bullock on the 
big screen - when she entered a beauty pageant for fun and ended up 
winning the contest.

Real-life
Miss Congeniality Robyn Morrison infiltrated drug gangs and snared 
paedophiles during her 10 years in the 
Australian police force.

Just for fun: Undercover police officer Robyn Morrison infiltrated drugs gangs and went after violent criminals during her day job... but she she just been crowned a beauty queen

High street fashion: Robyn said she modelled in clothes bought from TK Maxx and Next while other contestents spent a fortune on expensive dresses

However, after being crowned Mrs Galaxy UK, 
she now has her sights on conquering the rest of the global beauty world and
plans to represent Britain on an international level.

Robyn’s story mirrors Sandra 
Bullock’s character in the Hollywood blockbuster Miss Congeniality which
saw a police officer win a beauty contest.

Robyn, a mother-of-two who now runs a cheerleading school, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I won the pageant.

'I was a bit unsure about entering - I am a mum.

'But I thought what the hell and did it for a bit of fun and bought my dress for £50 from TK Max and bikini from Next.

'The other women spent thousands on their dresses and were very serious.

'People assume that women who participate in beauty pageants are airheads and bimbos - but I’m definitely neither of them.

'It is not something I have ever done before. Now I am going to America because of it.'

Robyn first worked as a bobby on the beat when she joined the police aged 18 after studying dance and drama at school.

But after a few years she became an 
undercover cop in Cabramatta, an area in Sydney which is notoriously 
dangerous and run by Vietnamese gangs.

Acting the part was not a problem for Robyn, who played policewoman Terri Hall in the soap Neighbours for two years.

During her time as an undercover 
officer Robyn, who is originally from Australia but has lived in the UK 
for the last six years, posed as a ‘junkie’ and had to socialise with 
drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps.

She even had her two front teeth 
knocked out when she got into a fight after officers who didn’t know she
was undercover stopped her as she tried to buy heroin with other users.

Robyn, who is married to Bradford 
Bulls star Glen Morrison, added: 'I’m proud of my police background - I 
worked tirelessly for years trying to keep the streets safe and drug 
free.

'I’ve got some really horrible stories but it doesn’t haunt me. It has not traumatised me. I don’t regret doing it.'

After a year of working undercover, 
Robyn was moved to an anti-theft unit before she went to work in child 
protection, dealing with paedophiles.

She competed in the Miss Galaxy contest six weeks ago in Cheshire and won a holiday to Florida.

She also won a host of other awards, including best swimwear, best fashion, most photogenic and best smile.

She will travel to America to represent the UK in Miss Galaxy next month.
