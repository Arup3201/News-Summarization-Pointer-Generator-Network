FIFA are refusing to rule out the possibilty of a re-vote on the locations of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups or that Russia and/or Qatar could be stripped of the tournaments.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter has stated unequivocally that Russia and Qatar will stage the events and ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert has ruled that a corruption probe found nothing that to undermine the ‘integrity’ of the votes, which were four years ago this week.

But well-placed sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the integrity of the 14-8 vote in favour of Qatar for 2022 in particular is ‘clouded in doubt at the least’ because of two ongoing investigations involving voting members of FIFA’s Exectuive Committee (ExCo).

As the MoS revealed last week, five FIFA officials face criminal investgation in Switzerland arising from bid business and several are believed to be ExCo voters.

FIFA investigator Michael Garcia is separately investigating alleged breaches of FIFA’s ethics code by four ExCo voters from 2010: Angel Maria Villar Llona of Spain, Worawi Makudi from Thailand and Michel D’Hooghe from Belgium (all still on the ExCo) and Franz Beckenbauer of Germany.

As few as three invalidated votes for Qatar for 2022 would potentially be enough to have changed the outcome in the USA’s favour and one source believes voters contributing six or more Qatar votes are among those being probed.

When the Mail on Sunday asked FIFA to clarify whether Russia and Qatar would keep the events regardless of the investigations, a spokeswoman said only: ‘The 2018 FIFA World Cup was awarded to Russia and the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar. FIFA does not comment on speculation.’

A British inquiry into alleged fraud in the process is underway by the Serious Fraud Office and will be mentioned in a parliamentary debate on Monday arranged by campaigning MP Damian Collins.
