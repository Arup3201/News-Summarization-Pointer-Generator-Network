South Africa were denied the chance to complete a clean sweep of New Zealand as the third and final one-day international was wiped out by rain in Hamilton.

The Proteas already had an unassailable 2-0 lead but were well placed to complete the whitewash as they moved to 157 for three after 30.4 overs before the heavens opened.

Following a lengthy delay, it was decided to abandon the match.

Opener Quinton de Kock found some form after two low scores and was unbeaten on 80 from 94 balls, while captain AB de Villiers was on 33 not out in an unbroken stand of 87.

That came after the tourists had slipped to 70 for three with Hasim Amla (12) and Rilee Rossouw (nought) falling to Matt Henry, the latter for his fourth duck in six ODIs, while David Miller was bowled by James Neesham for 17.
