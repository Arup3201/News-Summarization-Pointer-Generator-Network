A German tourist has been killed by a shark after having his leg bitten at an Egyptian beauty spot that is a popular destination for British holidaymakers.

The attack happened at a resort on Egypt's Red Sea, and police have revealed it is the first fatal shark attack in the region since 2010.

The 52-year-old man's body has been moved to a local hospital after the attack yesterday.

Officials are conducting an investigation into the attack, which saw the man's leg bitten off at the knee.

State news agency Al-Ahram report that the tourist was swimming with his wife when the attack happened. 

An official from the German Embassy in Cairo says they received reports that a German citizen died in the area but are not aware of the cause of death.

It was the first fatal shark attack in Egypt since a string of maulings in 2010 that left a German woman dead and three Russian tourists wounded in another Red Sea resort.

The shark attack is the first reported incident in five years, since one German woman was killed back in 2010

In 2010, the German pensioner was mauled to death as she snorkelled in relatively shallow waters around the resort, which is famed for its scuba diving sites.

She died just a day after Egyptian authorities lifted a 48-hour ban prompted by four other savage shark attacks. One victim lost a hand and another lost a leg.

The Red Sea is home to several species of shark, but the type believed to have been behind the 2010 attacks was the oceanic whitetip common to the region.

The attacks in 2010 forced the government to close off a stretch of beach in the Sharm el-Sheikh resort for a week.

In 2009, a shark killed a French woman off another resort close to where the German tourist was attacked on Sunday.
