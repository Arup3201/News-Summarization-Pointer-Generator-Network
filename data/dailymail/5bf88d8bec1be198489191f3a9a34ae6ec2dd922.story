Posing for pictures with fans is all part of the Manchester United job; but there was something different about this one.

A young fan, who bore a striking resemblance to United chief Louis van Gaal, has got social media buzzing after snapping a picture of the two of them during The Red Devils' 2-0 win over QPR.   

The photo which has since gone viral has invited plenty of witty captions with some fans even suggesting that the Dutchman had traveled back in time to meet his younger self.

United ran out 2-0 winners at Loftus Road with second-half goals from Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson. 

High-earner Radamel Falcao, however, on loan from AS Monaco, could not get his name on the score sheet.

The three points puts The Red Devils back on track for Champions League qualification after they were beaten by Southampton at Old Trafford last weekend.

QPR, meanwhile, remain in the Premier League relegation zone and are 19th with 19 points. 

Despite his high wages and reputation, Radamel Falcao has struggled for form since joining United on loan
