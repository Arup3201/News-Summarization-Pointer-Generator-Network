Gareth Southgate will stay loyal to the group who have taken England to Euro 2015 but says prodigies like Ross Barkley could learn by joining them in the Czech Republic.

England’s Under 21 head coach was determined to savour a proud moment in Vinkovci on Tuesday night, as his side beat Croatia 2-1, progressing to next summer’s European Championships 4-2 on aggregate.

Southgate has a strong core to his group but he could add sparkle to it by introducing individuals such as Barkley, his Everton club-mate John Stones, Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and Arsenal defender Calum Chambers. Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are also still eligible.

There is no possibility of Southgate becoming embroiled in any club-versus-country row but he did explain that whoever he takes to the Czech Republic would find the experience of playing in such an intense competition beneficial to their development.

He said: ‘I have been very careful throughout the campaign about who comes into the squad. They have to have a connection with the team and desire to come and play. I never worry about who I haven’t got and I’m not going to start now.

‘You can drive yourself to distraction. We could write a team sheet with illustrious names not involved here. The fact is, I believe we have such depth that we can challenge whoever we are playing with whatever players we put out on the pitch.

‘There may have been cases where some players haven’t fitted in to what we are doing. I certainly haven’t had a club pull out a player and thought “that’s a bit off”. Managers and coaches at clubs have been really supportive – and I don’ t think that will change.’

Of England’s outstanding display, Southgate added: ‘'I want the credit to be on the group who have achieved this. Can we win it? We have no way of knowing what the quality of the other teams are. The planning starts here.’

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere are also eligible to represent England at Euro 2015
