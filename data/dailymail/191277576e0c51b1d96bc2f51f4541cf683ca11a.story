Cats kill millions of birds each year but this little kitty can't get a claw in edgeways as he's accosted by a gaggle of excitable ducklings.

Russian YouTube user Ignoramusky posted a video showing the small feline inquisitively hopping into a box where he's greeted by more than a dozen feathered friends.

As the billed creatures rally towards him chirping, the kitten helplessly shuffles back into a corner. 

With a pounce of his fluffy paws he attempts to fend them off but the ducklings continue to come.

At one point a man reaches down to pull the kitty off one bird, which he grabs by the head.

Luckily no damage was done.

To date the video of the kitten and duckling encounter has been watched more than 150,000 times. 

Many viewers have deemed the clip 'cute' and 'adorable'.

One commenter added: 'That cat is going to have duck-filled nightmares for the rest of its life.'
