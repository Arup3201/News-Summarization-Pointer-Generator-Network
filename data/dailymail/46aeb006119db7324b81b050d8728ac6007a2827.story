He was making a speech about  the rights of working fathers to see their families.

So who better for Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to call on for support than his wife Miriam.

Spanish-born Mrs Clegg appeared to hijack her husband’s press conference with a colourful intervention, suggesting that men who treat women as equals have ‘more cojones’ than those who don’t.

For those whose Spanish is a little rusty, cojones means b***s.

Ms cojones: Clegg was told men who treat women as equals have more 'b***s'... by his own wife Miriam

It seemed to be a spontaneous interjection, but aides admitted it had been planned to generate publicity about an issue the couple believe needs debating.

‘It was just a slightly different way of making an important point,’ an aide said.

Mrs Clegg also hit out at ‘dinosaurs’ who believe childcare should be left to women and asked her husband to send out a message that caring for children ‘does not affect your level of testosterone’.

Mr Clegg feigned surprise at her intervention, joking to the audience: ‘Gosh, Miriam has put up her hand. I’m terrified about what is about to come . . .’

He began his answer: ‘Of course, I agree with you . . .’

Speaking yesterday at the launch of Cityfathers, an organisation for working fathers in the City of London, Mr Clegg said it was time bosses stopped ‘raising an eyebrow’ when men asked for time off work to care for their children.

It was a highly unusual intervention from the Deputy PM's wife, who is normally very careful not to comment on politics

He said fathers should not be made to see themselves as breadwinners rather than carers.

Mrs Clegg, a lawyer who earns four times as much as her husband, then put her hand up and said: ‘This is the moment of truth. You have spoken a lot about measures, which is all well and good. But an awful lot is about attitudes.

‘There are many, many dinosaurs, not here but out there, that still think that a man who takes care of his own children, he is some kind of less of a man.

'So if you and other modern working fathers could start saying not only loudly, but also proudly, that taking care of your own children and being responsible for those children does not affect your level of testosterone – and that men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones.’

Mr Clegg joked that he would not be translating ‘cojones’ for the audience. He said he ‘massively agreed’ with his wife, adding: ‘The idea that it is not manly to care is as absurd as saying that it is not womanly to work.’

Nick Clegg’s salary is vastly outstripped by his wife.

Mr Clegg earns £134,565 a year as an MP and Deputy Prime Minister, while Miriam Clegg – a Spanish-born lawyer for international legal firm Dechert – earns £500,000.

Three sons: Mr Clegg and his wife Miriam, who brings in a £500,000 salary from her legal work

The Cleggs live in a £1.6million townhouse in Putney, South-West London. They married in 2000 and have three sons – Antonio, Alberto and Miguel.

Mrs Clegg has said previously that the pair split the childcare and her husband often tried to do the school run. She admitted they had a ‘fantastic nanny’ to help look after the children.
