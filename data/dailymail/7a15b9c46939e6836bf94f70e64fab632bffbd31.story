Arthur Ransome: The author had extensive files kept on him by MI5

He is fondly remembered as the author of Swallows And Amazons, a tale of lakes and boats that was one of the best-loved children’s books of the 20th century.

But nearly 100 years ago Arthur Ransome was accused of less innocent writings - with MI5 suspecting he was a Russian spy.

British secret agents considered him an ardent Bolshevik and believed he was ‘a man who paints Russia as a paradise on earth’.

Details of Ransome’s ‘harmful’ political activities are among 150 top secret MI5 files opened during the First World War which are available online today for the first time.

Hand-written and typed intelligence reports, postcards and photographs of people and organisations involved in espionage were digitised by the National Archives.

Ransome enchanted generations of children with his stories happy families, holidays and not-very-dangerous adventures.

But today’s files show the British government’s agents and spies had concerns about the Rugby-educated writer’s true motives.

Despite being on the payroll of MI6 - code number S76 - to gather intelligence against Russia, the security services believed he could be an enemy of the state and a supporter of Bolshevist revolution.

As foreign correspondent for the now-defunct Daily News, Ransome witnessed the October Revolution of 1917 and became friendly with Lenin, founder of the Bolsheviks, and Trotsky, leader of the Red Army.

He also had an affair with Trotsky’s secretary, Eugenia Shelepina, and eventually married her in 1924 after helping her emigrate from Russia because she was ‘exposed to danger’ after helping MI5.

One typed military intelligence report, published online today, from July 1918 concludes that ‘Ransome has applauded the Bolsheviks to such an extent in his newspaper writing  that one is almost forced to a conclusion that he is a Bolshevik himself.’

Then in October 1918 an MI5 file notes that Ransome, at the time living in Stockholm, had ‘considerable influence’ with the Soviets.

A Dutch minister, WJ Oudendyk, warned that he was ‘continuing his propaganda work’ against Britain.

He noted Ransome had told friends in Russia he could ‘persuade the Bolsheviks that they may count on a large measure of support from the working classes in England’ in the event of revolution.

He arrived back in the UK in early-1919 but then applied to return to Russia as correspondent for the Manchester Guardian.

A scrawled handwritten note from that April cautions that if Ransome is to be permitted to go back ‘can we take him out of all anti-Bolshevik theatres of operation. If the decision to attempt to do so is final [we] must take action without delay.’

But on August 16, Brigadier General William Thwaites said in a despatch to Sir Edward Troup at the Home Office that it would be ‘most undesirable for a British subject who holds such views as Ransome does to go to Russia. I should say he would do less harm in this country.’

Meanwhile, the National Archives files reveal concerns over the relationship between the British scout movement - more often associated with camping and knot-tying - and their counterparts in Germany.In the aftermath of the Great War relations between scouts in the two countries were hostile.

Letters from 1919 show that there were objections to German scouts attending the international jamboree in London Olympia the following year.

A letter from the Foreign Office states: ‘The attitude of the British Boy Scouts Association is that they will certainly not have any German Boy Scouts here next year at their international show at Olympia.’

The files also reveal fears that the Boy Scout Association was being infiltrated by Communists during the First World War.

In a case of ‘red under the camp beds’, correspondence from 1920 shows that enquiries were made about the ‘red boy scout movement’ and its influence in Britain.

Investigations showed ‘no record of any such movement’ but fears resurfaced in 1954 when a 19-year-old Scout was thrown out of the organisation because he was a member of the Young Communist League’s National Committee.

Paul Garland, a scout from the age of eight, was accused of conducting ‘anti-religious propaganda’ and was forced to leave the movement.

The file says of Mr Garland: ‘Not only has he been found inspired by communist ideas, but to be a high-ranked communist leader as well, who as such made oath to conduct anti-religious propaganda.

‘The National Board declared, that GARLAND could not keep his scout’s pledge, as the first article of this reads: “I hearby solemnly promise earnestly to try to do my duty towards God and my country.”

‘In the opinion of the Board the question had nothing to do with politics’ the point, however, was whether a scout can keep a promise, when he is a Communist.’

The files are part of the National Archives’ First World War 100 programme of digitised releases and events to mark the centenary of the 1914-18 conflict.

They contain details of spies around the world, including British nurse Edith Cavell who was executed by the Germans for saving captured soldiers and Mata Hari, the notorious female spy and entertainer.

National Archives records specialist Dr Stephen Twigge said: ‘The files in the National Archives’ collection reveal the importance of the security service in safeguarding the nation during the First World War. Now people across the globe can discover the secret history behind the war for themselves.’
