While the days of turning up to the Qantas lounge in thongs and a singlet may be over for some, other Australians will be exempt from the newly enforced dress codes.

Last month it was announced that visitors to the lounge 'meet the appropriate standard' of attire, and while the rules have been in place for many years would actually be enforced from April 1 this year.

However travellers in Darwin, Cairns and the Gold Coast will still be able to don their weekend barbeque best for the lounges.

Qantas head of domestic product and service Helen Gray told the NT News the rule would be 'a friendly ­reminder' at lounges in Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide.

Qantas lounges have always had dress codes but they have not been strictly enforced before

Now the airline will enforce it, except in Darwin, Cairns and the Gold Coast

Darwin travellers told the publication they did not think Qantas would be able to enforce the dress code in the Northern Territory even if they tried.

One man even admitted he didn't think he owned 'smart casual' attire. 

Last month the airline announced its lounge staff will soon be ensuring visitors to Qantas will be keeping a closer eye on what you are wearing and will only allow you into their fancy waiting areas if you wearing 'smart casual' clothing from now April 1.

However, the airline has refused to define exactly what is and is not allowed to be worn and each customer will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  

Signs will be put up outside the Qantas lounges  highlighting the policy.

Helen Gray, Qantas' Head of Domestic Product & Service, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From April 2015, customers entering domestic Qantas Clubs and Business Lounges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney will receive a friendly reminder about the smart casual dress guidelines that apply.' 

People wearing thongs will probably no longer be allowed in the Qantas lounges around Australia

If you have ever wanted to experience Qantas business class you'll have to dress the part 

'The vast majority of our members meet and exceed the guidelines, but we have had some feedback from customers that they want to see those guidelines apply to everyone.

'The dress guidelines for our lounges are the same as most restaurants and clubs.' 

Playing the role of bouncers, Qantas staff is allowed to use their 'discretion' to determine if a visitor to the lounge meets the smart casual dress guidelines.'

Singlets, bare feet, and rubber thongs 'in most cases' will be deemed unacceptable in capital city  lounges.

This will be the first time the dress code – which has always existed – is actively enforced.

The decision has reportedly been made after feedback from customers concerned about the style inside the expensive lounges.

High-vis clothing and work attire will still be allowed.

High-vis clothing and work uniforms will still be allowed in the lounges

It's unlikely this woman would get through the doors into the Qantas lounges from now on

The move comes after the airline announced they would be opening the doors to the business class lounge to people who never had the money or the points to use it before.

They announced this week that customers will be able to combine their cash and air miles to experience how the other half fly.

Frequent flyers who have points coming out of their ears have no need to panic about ending up in cattle class as the points-only upgrades will be processed first before the online bidding begins.

However, economy passengers can only get involved in the Bid Now Upgrades if they receive an invite via an email seven days before departure. Bidder's offers can be modified or cancelled at any time up until 24 hours before departure, but passengers don't see each other's offers.

Passengers will be notified via email about one day before departure about whether their offer has been successful - and if not, they are not out of pocket and keep their original seat.

Overly revealing clothes will not be allowed in the Qantas business lounge from April 1 

Frequent flyers who have points coming out of their ears have no need to panic about ending up in cattle class as the points-only upgrades will be processed first before the online bidding begins

The minimum points needed are from 3,000 for a domestic upgrade and from 5,000 for an international upgrade with a minimum dollar amount also required.

Qantas Loyalty CEO Lesley Grant said the system is designed for passengers who don't have a balance high enough to request an upgrade using points alone.

'For a member who doesn't have enough points to submit an upgrade request for their whole family, Bid Now Upgrades offers an alternative chance to travel at the front of the plane with their spouse and children using a combination of money and points,' she said.

Ms Grant said the new system will not change the process or priority for frequent flyers submitting Classic Upgrade Rewards more than 24 hours out from their scheduled departure.

'This new initiative will in no way impact the chances of members securing a Classic Upgrade Reward - these will always be confirmed first regardless of their Frequent Flyer tier and they remain the best value option,' she said.
