The number of fines issued to parents taking their children on holiday during school term-time has soared by more than 70 per cent.

Nearly 5,300 penalties were handed to families by 34 councils across England during last year's autumn term, according to new research by the BBC.

It marks a 74 per cent increase from the autumn term in 2012, indicating more parents are willing to face a fine in order to save cash when booking a family holiday.

Family holiday: There have been an increase in the number of fines issued to parents for term-time breaks

Why can't you take your child on holiday in term time?Many schools used to give pupils authorised absences of up to ten days during term time.But in September Education Secretary Michael Gove banned the allowance in all but ‘exceptional circumstances’.

A maximum fine of £60 per pupil per parent can now be charged, rising to £120 if not paid within seven days.

Refusal to pay can mean a fine of up to £2,500 and up to three years in jail.

Why do holiday firms increase prices?Travel
companies insist they are responding to demand. They make more money 
when demand peaks in the six-week summer holiday, which offsets smaller 
margins in low season.

They claim they trying to cap charges during school holidays will push up prices year round.

The huge rise comes after tougher regulations on term-time holidays were introduced by the government last September, prompting a debate in parliament over fears travel companies were 'cashing in' by putting up prices during school breaks due to increased demand.

A family holiday during half-terms can be twice as expensive as the week before.

However, since September 1, 2013, schools have been stopped from allowing children 10 days of leave a year for family breaks in 'special circumstances'. Now, requests for term-time holidays are at the head teacher's discretion.

The new research, carried out by BBC Breakfast, found only six out of 34 local authorities that responded to its questions had not fined any parents, while two had seen a decrease in the number of penalties issued, and 26 reported an increase.

Overall, the average rise for fines issued to parents in the autumn term 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 was 74 per cent.

And Liverpool City Council noted the biggest rise - up from 97 in 2012 to 250 last year.

Council spokesman Ron Collinson said the interests of the child have to come first.

'You save a lot of money, but you pay the cost at the other end in terms of your child's schooling,' he said.

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent.

'That is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We are giving all schools the autonomy to set their own term dates.

'We want to see more parents asking schools to consider changes to term and holiday dates that will work for pupils and their families.'
