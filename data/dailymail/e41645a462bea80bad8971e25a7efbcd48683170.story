Court papers reveal Mr Osbourne and his wife Louise petitioned for bankruptcy and were declared so on September 25 at Birmingham County Court. 

It is not clear how much money the couple owe or to whom they are indebted, though the case description indicates Mr Osbourne's wish to remain in the entertainment industry. 

Meanwhile his famous father is due make millions of pounds from Black Sabbath's extensive world tour, with tickets starting at £61.

Ozzy Osbourne and his wife Sharon are worth an estimated £100million combined

The tour will end in December with two homecoming arena shows in Birmingham. 

Ozzy, 64, and his wife Sharon Osbourne, 
61, are reportedly worth more than £100million, with property in Beverly
Hills and Buckinghamshire.

In 2011 Louis Osbourne spoke of his father describing him as 'great' and a 'doting grandad'.

He
told the Birmingham Mail: 'Dad usually calls on a Sunday afternoon for a
catch up and when he comes over to the UK we take the kids down (to 
his home in Buckinghamshire).'

The couple moved to Harborne with their two young children to be nearer Louis's mother, after living in Los Angeles and Dublin.

After finding success as a DJ on the party island of Ibiza, Louis set up his own record label.

His
wife Louise has worked with the likes of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julia 
Roberts and Eddie Murphy throughout her career as an actress and 
producer.

Speaking of the couple's financial trouble, Louise told the Sunday Mercury she and Louis were trying to move forward.

'We want to put it behind us and move on with our lives,' she said. 'I don't really want to comment any further.'
