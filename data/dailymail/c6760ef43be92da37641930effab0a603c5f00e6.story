Finnair has been forced to backtrack on claims it didn't fly in Ukrainian airspace after being lambasted on social media as airlines struggle to come to terms with the Malaysian Airlines tragedy.

Finnair was not alone as they looked to ease the worries of their own passengers after the MH17 disaster which saw the Malaysian flight crash in Ukraine, killing 298 passengers.

SIngapore Airlines apologised on Saturday after their statement about not flying in Ukraine airspace was viewed by many on social media as insensitive. 

Mistake: Finnair said it didn't fly in Ukraine airspace but was forced to admit their mistake

After expressing their sympathy for their fellow oneworld partner on social media and offering their assistance, Finnair stated: 'Finnair does not fly over Ukraine. Your safety is our top priority.'

The comment was quickly refuted by follower Mikko Laaksonen, who posting a Flightradar24 diagram which as he said suggested otherwise.

After initially claiming the data and 
map were incorrect, Finnair admitted their mistake and extended their 
apology by way of a clarification late on Saturday.

Proven wrong: Mikko Laaksonen posted a flightradar graphic showing the airline did fly over Ukraine

Finnair: #MH17 - We stand with our fellow oneworld partner @MAS and stand ready to assist in any way we can.

Finnair: For those of you wondering, Finnair does not fly over Ukraine. Your safety is our top priority.

MPLaaksonen: "Finnair does not fly over Ukraine. Your safety is our top priority." @Finnair This flightradar info says differently

Finnair: @MPLaaksonen Flightradar is inaccurate and it does not take into account that the world is round. :) The route goes on the West border.

Flightradar24: ‏ @Finnair @MPLaaksonen Flightradar24 data is very accurate. A flight over Ukraine is over Ukraine no matter i world is flat or round.

Finnair We were wrong. Apologies! MT @flightradar24: FR24 data is very accurate. Flight over Ukraine is over Ukraine no matter what.

Finnair:  We don't currently fly in the Ukranian airspace. Small delays are possible. We're sorry but we hope you understand!

Finnair: Finnair has made the decision not to fly in Ukraine aerospace for time being.

'Finnair has no regular flights that would fly in the Dnipropetrovski airspace over Eastern Ukraine where the incident took place,' the airline said in a statement.

'Since the spring, following Eurocontrol's recommendations, Finnair has also avoided the airspace of Simferopol in the Crimea crisis area in Southern Ukraine.

'Finnair has continued flights in 
Western Ukrainian airspace and Eurocontrol has not had any flight 
restriction recommendations regarding this particular area.

'Finnair has made the decision not to fly in Ukraina aerospace for time being. The company will evaluate the situation very carefully and consider the recommendations and decisions of the aviation authorities when making any further decisions.'

The airline explains that new routes will take 'slightly longer' and cause slight delays, whether directly or indirectly.

'Finnair regrets any inconvenience this might cause to its passengers but wants to emphasize its commitment to safety,' the statement said.
