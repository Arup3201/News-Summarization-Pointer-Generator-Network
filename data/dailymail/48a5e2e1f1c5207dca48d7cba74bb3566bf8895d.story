This is the hilarious moment a teenage boy ranted about Beyonce after having his wisdom teeth removed under anesthesia.

Cody Lanphere, 17, was filmed by his mother, Christine Weber Livingston, as they drove home to Benson, North Carolina, on Monday following the surgery.

Still feeling the effects of the drugs, he deliriously asked his mother where the 33-year-old singer was, to which she replied: 'Beyonce couldn't make it.'

Delirious: Cody Lanphere, 17, was filmed ranting about Beyonce (pictured) by his mother, Christine Weber Livingston, as they drove home to Benson, North Carolina, on Monday following wisdom teeth surgery

The teenager, whose mouth was filled with bloodied gauze, then broke down, wailing: 'She told - she told me she'd be here. She lied to me! She lied to me, mommy!'

Seconds later, he started clutching at his chest, prompting Ms Livingston to say: 'What are you looking for?' In response, the panicked teenager asked: 'Where's my heart?'

Unable to contain her laughter, his mother replied: 'Your heart is in your chest. They didn't take your heart. They only took your teeth.' 

During the drive home, Cody, a competitive hip-hop dancer, also repeatedly declared 'I'm dying!', wailed that he looked like 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' and cried about 'not wanting to be fat'.

Star: Later in the footage, Ms Livingston asked him if he knew where they were going, to which he replied: 'Africa - to see Beyonce (pictured)' And when she asked him when he would like to go, he said: 'Now'

But before long, the freshman at Johnston Community College in Smithfield was back on to his favorite topic - Beyonce.

Ms Livingston asked him if he knew where they were going, to which he replied: 'Africa - to see Beyonce.' And when she asked him when he would like to go, he simply said: 'Now.' 

Later in the 12-minute footage, the wad of gauze fell out of Cody's mouth, causing him to look down at it in horror and ask: 'Is that blood?' In response, his mother replied: 'Yes!'.

The amusing video, which also saw the teenager say his doctor 'isn't American, so what does he know?',  was later uploaded to YouTube and Facebook.

Stunned: Cody (pictured, left, and, right, with a hip-hop dance trophy) said he was 'bewildered' by the video

In an interview with ABC News on Thursday, Cody said he was 'completely bewildered' when his mother showed him the footage. 

'I couldn't even believe that that's how I was acting because I don't remember any of it,' he said.

However, the dancer said he was not shocked by his Beyonce comments - as he has long dreamed of meeting the Crazy In Love singer.

'Ah, Beyonce,' he said. 'Who doesn't love her? I love her -- I mean, she's amazing. I love what she stands for, all about independence … I've loved her since Destiny's Child.'

Back to normal: Several hours after the wisdom teeth removal, Cody tweeted: 'My loopy drugs have finally worn off! I'm back to regular Cody! I'm in some pain, so pray for a speedy recovery!' (pictured)

Ms Livingston told the broadcaster her son had taken Valium before the surgery, so had been 'a little loopy' before his wisdom teeth were even removed.

'My son has never had surgery he has never had drugs or anything, so this is quite a reaction to say the least,' she said. 

Several hours after the removal, Cody tweeted: 'My loopy drugs have finally worn off! I'm back to regular Cody! I'm in some pain, so pray for a speedy recovery!'.
