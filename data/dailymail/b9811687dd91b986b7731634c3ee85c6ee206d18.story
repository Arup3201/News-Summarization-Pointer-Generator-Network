Dapper in a navy suit, Prince Harry looked fresh-faced as he arrived in Oman this morning, following an overnight flight from London.

The 30-year-old is on the first leg of a three-day tour that will see him take in souks, sword dances and a visit to an ancient fort, and was met by an honour guard, some of whom carried traditional daggers.

Blinking in the desert sun, Harry was greeted at Muscat International Airport  by Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman's first cousin and the Omani Patron of the Omani-British Friendship Association.

The two men posed for a brief photo call in typical Middle Eastern style, sitting on two chairs in an elaborately decorated lounge underneath the sword and dagger symbol of the Omani Sultanate.

Harry told his Royal host: 'I send best wishes from Her Majesty. She is very well.' He was then offered coffee and a traditional sweet treat with almonds known as halwa.

The prince left accompanied by his Scotland Yard police protection officers and Omani bodyguards wearing the traditional khan-jer - dagger - in their belts. 

Harry is staying in the desert kingdom at the private invitation of the Sultan and had been due to attend a National Day celebration today in his honour.

Unfortunately the Omani leader is currently receiving medical treatment in Germany for an undisclosed illness, meaning the parade will now no longer take place.

According to Kensington Palace, The Diwan - the Royal Court - in Oman - was still keen for the royal visit to take place, however, and Harry will continue with his plans to visit attractions including the Nizwa Fort and the Grand Mosque.

A spokesman said: 'The Prince is travelling to Oman at the personal invitation of His. Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said. 

'The visit reflects the close personal and respectful relationship that exists between The Royal Families of both countries.

'Despite The Sultan's unavailability to personally host Prince Harry on this occasion, both parties were keen that the visit still takes place given the direct and personal nature of the invitation.'

The aide added: 'It will be an opportunity for a Prince Harry to see and experience the country for the first time following recent successful and enjoyable visits by other members of his family.' 

These include the Queen and Prince Philip in 2010 and Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall just last year.

The royal's new itinerary in the Sultanate will now include a visit to The British Embassy in Muscat, where Harry will have an opportunity to meet staff and hear about the work of the officials there. 

Tomorrow he will also visit the historic Nizwa Fort, where the prince will view local arts and crafts at a souq outside the gates before being greeted with a traditional sword dance inside the Fort's main courtyard.

 Harry will also enjoy a guided tour around the historic ramparts of the Fort itself, which offer stunning views of Nizwa and the surrounding mountains. 

Nizwa Fort was built in the 1650s by Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi, although its underlying structure dates back to the 12th Century. 

It is Oman's most visited national monument and a reminder of the city's significant role through some of the more turbulent periods in Oman's history. On Thursday the prince will be taken to the stunning Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat where he will be shown around by a member of the Diwan Higher Centre for Culture and Science.

The mosque was a gift to the nation by the Sultan to mark the 30th year of his reign and can accommodate a staggering 20,000 worshippers, including 750 women in a private musalla or prayer hall. 

On Thursday the prince will fly to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates where he will play in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club.

Afterwards Harry will attend a fundraising dinner and give a speech. The match is in aid of the charity he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, following a gap year visit to Lesotho. The name Sentebale means 'forget me not' in the local dialect, Basotho. 

Lesotho is a tiny, poverty-stricken and landlocked kingdom in Southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world. Sentebale supports the many thousands of children affected by the AIDS epidemic both directly and though losing their families to the disease. 

Colourful: Oman is famous for its colourful horse parades, but Prince Harry will now miss out on one

Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV. 

The Sentebale Cup, which is in its fifth year, is helping to support the Mamohato Programme, which address the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV as well as working to reduce the stigma linked to the disease and helping to markedly improve their quality of life. 

Harry, who plans to make a visit to some of the charity's projects in Lesotho next June, has said he hopes to expand its work to other countries in Africa. 

It is understood that Harry plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after the official elements of the trip have concluded on Thursday to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit, which is on this weekend.
