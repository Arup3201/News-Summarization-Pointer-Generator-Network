Leave: Lafayette Hall, who runs the Sampson Correctional Institution, pictured, has been placed on paid administrative leave

A warden at a North Carolina prison has been suspended after allegedly forcing inmates to kiss deadly snakes and rub hot sauce on their genitals, leaving them 'blistered and raw for days.'

Lafayette Hall, who runs the Sampson Correctional Institution in Clinton, has been placed on paid leave while the state investigates claims he mistreated and humiliated six prisoners for the amusement of guards.

In a letter from July, the inmates beg for help, claiming officers had forced them to gulp spoonfuls of an 'Exotic Hot Sauce' that is so hot it warns of 'death, burns and blisters' on the bottle, in return for work assignments that paid just 70 cents.

The group of prisoners also accuse guards of forcing them to simulate sex acts in exchange for 'payoffs' such as cigarettes and alcohol.

'While we are at work the officers forces us to do racist, homosexual, humiliating, and demorilizing acts to ourself (sic) and each other for payoffs such as cigarettes, food, drinks, and beer,' reads the letter, sent to a federal magistrate in Greensboro.

The guards allegedly forced the inmates to 'pull their pants down so the officers can watch them rub hot sauce on their rectums and testicals wich (sic) leave them blistered and raw for days.'

According to the Smoking Gun,
the six prisoners claim the corrections officers made three white 
inmates 'force a Black man down, grab his testicals (sic), and make him 
scream and swear that "He is white and proud of it."'

Seeking help: The prisoners, including Phillip Jarman, 27, left, and Jamey Dowless, 36, right, wrote the letter seeking help from a magistrate

The letter says black men were forced to treat the white prisoners in a similar fashion.

While working on a road work crew, the inmates said guards made them 'catch deadly snakes and kiss them on the mouths' and 'catch rabbits and mice to throw in front of oncoming cars so they can be run over and killed.'

The letter, signed by inmates Gary Parker, 34, Thomas Patten, 25, Cedric Williams, 22, Phillip Jarman, 27, Donnie Ivey, 52, and Jamey Dowless, 36, was sent to the magistrate asking for legal representation to help file a class action against the prison system.

Claims: Donnie Ivey, 52, left, and Thomas Patten, 25, right, claimed guards forced the inmates to do humiliating things

But the group of prisoners said in the letter that they were 'afraid of some kind of retaliation... when all this comes out,' referring to their revelations.

Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Pamela Walker said Mr Hall was no longer working at the North Carolina facility and a second employee had also been reassigned since the claims were made.

Mr Hall has worked at the Sampson facility for more than 20 years.

A North Carolina Department of Correction press release from 2000 said the father-of-one spent his spare time serving as a trustee at his church, First Baptist in Kenansville.
