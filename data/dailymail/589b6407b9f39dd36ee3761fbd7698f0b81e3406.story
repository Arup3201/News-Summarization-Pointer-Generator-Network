Attacked: Levi Rosenblat, 22, is in hospital after he was stabbed in the temple early on Tuesday

A knife-wielding man has been shot dead by police after he burst into a Brooklyn synagogue and stabbed an Israeli student in the head while shouting: 'Kill the Jews!'

Calvin Peters, 51, stormed into the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world headquarters in Crown Heights at about 1.40am on Tuesday and attacked Levi Rosenblat, who was studying inside the synagogue.

Rosenblat, who is in stable condition in hospital after being stabbed in the temple, only arrived in the U.S. two weeks ago, the New York Daily News reported.

Witnesses heard the man saying 'Kill the Jews' repeatedly and several other people immediately intervened, said Chaim Landa, a spokeswoman for Chabad-Lubavitch.

A witness flagged down a patrol officer, who confronted the stabber and told him to put the knife down. He initially put it down, but picked it up again, police said.

More officers responded and repeatedly ordered the man to drop the knife.

He refused and, with the knife in his hand, charged at one of the officers, who fired once, striking the man in the torso, police said. Police said no other officers discharged their weapons.

Footage of the incident shared by 0404 shows the man moving towards police with the knife as an officer shouts: 'Drop the f***ing knife'.

As the person recording the video seeks shelter behind a book case, a single shot rings out.

The man was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police said he was from New York City and had a criminal history. CNN reported that he was believed to be homeless. 

A nine-inch knife, with a four-inch blade, was recovered at the scene, police said.

A witness told the Daily News, that he ran over to Rosenblat, who is from Beitar Illit in Gush Etzion, after he was stabbed. 

'I went over to the floor,' he said. 'I saw the teenager on the floor, his hair was blood. He was saying "save me".'

Another witness said they saw the stabber enter the synagogue an hour earlier and ask for a book before returning with a knife and carried out his attack. 

Weapon: This blood-covered knife was recovered at the scene following the early-morning attack

Scene: The attack unfolded at the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world headquarters in Crown Heights

In shock: Members of the Lubavitch community and police officers stand outside Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic headquarters on Tuesday, just hours after the knife-wielding man was shot dead

'We commend the heroic efforts of the individuals who were present and took immediate action. If not for their intervention the outcome could have been, God forbid far worse,' said Landa. 

'While we are very pained by everything that has unfolded, we are very grateful to the police for their quick response and are working closely with the authorities in their ongoing investigation,' she added.

Police said the investigation is continuing.
