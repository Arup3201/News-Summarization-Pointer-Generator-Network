A full 30 years after the original Back To The Future film debuted, the time-traveling adventure is set to return, this time as a stage musical.

Producers have confirmed that a show adapted from the sci-fi comedy franchise starring Michael J. Fox will open in London's West End in 2015, the 30th anniversary of the film.

A Broadway run is a possibility if the new musical flies as well as the film's specially equipped DeLorean.

The new musical will have a book by the film's director Rober Zemeckis, Bob Gale and Jamie Lloyd, along with new music and lyrics by composer Alan Silvestri and songwriter and record producer Glen Ballard. Lloyd also will direct.

Back in time: The West End looks set to rock around the clock: Back to the Future is to become a West End musical in time for the film's 30th anniversary next year

Hit: The movie, a huge hit in 1985, starred Michael J Fox as Marty McFly, the California teenager who jeopardizes his parents' high-school relationship after accidentally time-travelling back to 1955

Long-term project: The film's director, Robert Zemeckis (pictured) and co-writer Bob Gale have reunited for the musical, a project they've been considering for a decade. Their script reportedly follows the original plot, but makes some changes

'The production will include 
illusions, skateboarding and many other surprises that will capture the 
spirit of the film but freshly interpret it for a new audience,' Lloyd 
said in a statement Friday.

Bob
 Gale commented, "The Back to the Future musical is a project that Bob 
Zemeckis and I have been exploring for almost ten years. 

We're
 thrilled to be at last in partnership with a creative and producing 
team that will create a show that is true to the spirit of the film 
without being a slavish remake.

Director
 Jamie Lloyd is full of passion, energy and imaginative ideas and we are
 overjoyed to have the film's composer Alan Silvestri composing the 
music.

Reunion: Actors Mary Steenburgen, Christopher Lloyd, Robert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson attend the Back To The Future 25th anniversary. In 2015, the film will be 30 years and a new musical is the perfect way to celebrate

In safe hands: British director Jamie Lloyd will take charge of the DeLorean time machine after running two separate workshops for the musical later this year, one in Los Angeles, another in London

Headcase: Christopher Lloyd in a scene from the movie Back to The Future. The musical will feature a number of songs from the original soundtrack and its composer Alan Silvestri, who worked on the original film, is creating some new material

With all of us working together, we know the integrity of the material will be preserved in a production that will be a wonderful companion to the Trilogy.

We intend to use music from the movie along with brand new songs to make a version of Back to the Future that is fresh, entertaining, and takes advantage of all the amazing things that can now be done on stage.  We can't think of a better way to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film.'

In the 1985 film, Marty McFly becomes a human guinea pig who travels back to his hometown in 1955. Once there, he gets caught up in the soap opera lives of his own teenage parents, including his mom who develops a crush on her future son.

The film was written by Zemeckis and Gale and had plenty of music, including the Huey Lewis and the News theme tune 'The Power of Love' and Marty McFly's futuristic rendition of 'Johnny B. Goode.'

The film, which co-starred Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, was so successful that it spawned two more sequels, 'Back to the Future Part II' in 1989 and 'Back to the Future Part III' in 1990.

On stage: Marty McFly and Doc Brown will storm onto the West End stage in their DeLorean for a musical based on Robert Zemeckis's and Bob Gale's cherished '80s classic

Gotta get back in time! With Gale, Zemeckis and Silvestri on board, the Back to the Future stage musical is something to look forward to...

The new musical will join such recent Gen X screen-to-stage remakes as 'Ghost,' ''Little Shop of Horrors,' ''Flashdance,' ''Dirty Dancing,' ''Big,' ''Legally Blonde,' ''The Wedding Singer,' ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' and 'Elf.'

Oscar-winner Zemeckis has directed all 'Back to the Future' films, as well as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit,' ''Forrest Gump,' 'The Polar Express' and 'Flight.'

Silvestri has scored many of Zemeckis' films, including 'Romancing the Stone,' ''Forrest Gump' and 'Cast Away.' Ballard, a six-time Grammy Award winner, co-wrote and produced 'Jagged Little Pill' for Alanis Morissette and co-wrote the music for the stage musical adaptation of 'Ghost.'

Lloyd's credits include 'Cyrano de Bergerac' on Broadway, 'The Duchess of Malfi' at the Old Vic and 'She Stoops to Conquer' at the National Theatre. Gale, a frequent Zemeckis collaborator, has also written comic books, including issues of 'Batman.'

Set and costume designs will be by Soutra Gilmour, illusions by Paul Kieve, lighting design by Jon Clark, and musical supervision by Alan Williams. Andrew Willis will be skateboard consultant.

Remember?Fox, famously, plays Marty McFly: a high school wannabe guitarist who lives in suburban Twin Pines a sort of everytown USA with a father (Crispin Glover) who has no backbone and a mother (Lea Thompson) who is a lush

The movie opens with The Power Of Love by Huey Lewis And The News.

That song will be in the show, along with Johnny B. Goode, Earth Angel and Mr Sandman. Alan Silvestri, who wrote the original score for the films, will collaborate with Glen Ballard on some  original songs. Ingram said the show will stick to the same time periods as the first film. ‘You can’t mess with history,’ he joked.

Andrew Willis, who designed the Hackney Wick skateboarding park, has signed on as a consultant and will help the cast with their skateboarding skills.

The creative team will also include set designer Soutra Gilmour, lighting expert Jon Clark, and illusionist Paul Kieve.

‘Now all we have to find is a young man to play Marty,’ Ingram said. ‘He needs to be a guitarist, a singer, an actor — and good looking. We’ll provide the time machine.’
