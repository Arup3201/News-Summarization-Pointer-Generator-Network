A trainee solicitor at one of the UK's leading law firms is facing disciplinary action after he drunkenly described his job as 'f****** people over for money' in a student video.

The unnamed Clifford Chance trainee is filmed describing himself as a 'City lad' on the online video for Oxford student newspaper Cherwell.

The interview was carried out for the student newspaper's series of online videos, Shark Tales, which features student journalist Toby Mather speaking to drunken students on the streets in the early hours of the morning.

On camera: A trainee solicitor could lose his job after describing his work as 'f****** people over for money' in a drunken interview

The trainee solicitor tells Mr Mather 'I f****** love the ladness' which he described as 'just basically f****** people over for money'.

He later adds: 'I refuse my consent for this to go on the internet and I will sue you if you put it on'.

According to The Independent, a Clifford Chance, spokesman has said one of the firm's trainee lawyers was now facing disciplinary action.

The spokesman told reporters: 'The comments made are inappropriate and they are at odds with our principles and the professional standards we espouse as a firm.

'One of our trainee lawyers is the subject of our formal disciplinary procedures which may result in termination of the training contract with the firm'.

Clifford Chance is an international law firm which has its headquarters in the UK.

The unnamed Clifford Chance trainee later tells the interviewer: 'I refuse my consent for this to go on the internet and I will sue you if you put it on'

It is one of the 'Magic Circle' of the UK's top five law firms and has 35 offices in 25 countries across the world.

The video was originally published on Cherwell's website in May, but it was only reported on legal blogs this week.

Shark Tales presenter Mr Mather told Cherwell how news of the disciplinary procedure illustrated the role social media now played in modern working life.

they are at odds with our principles and the professional standards we 
espouse as a firm'

On Monday, MailOnline reported how a primary school teaching assistant won £16,000 after she was unfairly sacked for swearing and posting a picture of herself drinking from a penis straw on Facebook.

Paula Williams, 45, was dismissed after a member of staff overheard her saying ‘f***’ to another teacher in the playground.

The divorced mum-of-two from Hednesford in Staffordshire was also disciplined after a picture appeared on Facebook showing her drinking from a joke ‘penis straw’ at a Christmas party.

She was also accused of using the phrase ‘sexy beast’ to a child and taking a book entitled ‘I shot my daddy’ on a swimming trip.

She appealed the decision and took the school to an employment tribunal claiming unfair dismissal.

The tribunal in Birmingham ruled in her favour and ordered the school to pay her £16,437.79 in compensation.
