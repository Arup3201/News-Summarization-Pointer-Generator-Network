This was just the second time in three years England manager Roy Hodgson has dared to venture to the Stadium of Light, but on the evidence of this sour stalemate he will not be back.

It wasn’t only the Three Lions contenders – Saido Berahino and Jermain Defoe - who failed to impress, every player on the pitch was as desperate as the next.

Referee Mike Jones and his assistants were equally inept, failing to send off West Brom’s Joleon Lescott early in the game and later denying Sunderland a legitimate goal.

The Premier League table after Saturday's Premier League game

Lee Cattermole worked tirelessly in midfield for Sunderland, as his heat map shows in our brillant Match Zone

But for Hodgson, it was a wasted trip. Or perhaps not, for neither Baggies frontman Berahino nor ex-Toronto striker Defoe – bidding for a recall having returned to the Premier League in January – did anything to suggest they are more deserving of inclusion ahead of the likes of Harry Kane.

It was a contest – if you can call it that – low on entertainment and quality. Indeed, Tony Pulis’ West Brom barely mustered an effort on goal.

The draw – Sunderland’s 13th of the Premier League season - has done little to ease the pressure on Black Cats boss Gus Poyet, who this week penned an open letter to the fans asking for their support.

But the Uruguayan did have reason to moan about some first-half refereeing.

The game was just five minutes old when Lee Cattermole sprung Danny Graham clear on the shoulder of Lescott and, under what appeared minimal contact from the recovering defender, the striker flopped to the turf.

Referee Jones looked to have made the right call when waving play on, only for assistant Constantine Hatzidakis to flag for an infringement.

Lescott, then, would surely have to go. Jones, though, perhaps doubting the advice of his assistant, opted to show yellow. It was a weak decision.

From the resulting free-kick Seb Larsson whipped into the side-netting

What followed was 20 minutes of scrap and tedium, only broken when a Darren Fletcher mistake presented the hosts with a chance to break. Defoe fed Ricky Alvarez and he cut infield before lashing narrowly wide with his left boot.

Defoe then took aim from a narrow angle but failed to defy it and smashed across goal and wide.

Whistler Jones and his team were again the centre of attention when disallowing Adam Johnson’s goal on the stroke of half-time. Alvarez crossed to the far post where the winger – played onside by Craig Dawson – controlled before dashing across the six-yard box and toeing in. It should have stood.

There was still time for Larsson to test the palms of Ben Foster 30 yards as Sunderland finished the half on the front foot.

The home fans did respond to Poyet’s call for support after the break but such enthusiasm was not a result of anything they’d witnessed on the pitch.

It wasn’t until the 62nd minute that full-back Santiago Vergini flashed wide a header from Larsson’s corner. The Argentine, unmarked eight yards out, should have scored.

Poyet reacted by bringing on strike pairing Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham and the latter soon carved a chance for Defoe, but he shot wide.

Wickham himself was then denied by Foster’s instinctive save after darting to the near post to connect with Johnson’s flag-kick.

And that was where the incident finished, some 20 minutes from time.

As for Hodgson, he was soon long gone. We don’t expect to see him again.
