Bonnie and Clyde have been dead 75 years, but their days of emptying bank vaults aren't over. 

On Sunday an anonymous buyer shelled out more than half a million dollars to purchase two pistols the infamous robbers were carrying when they were gunned down by police in 1934.

Bonnie Parker's .38-caliber Colt Detective Special and Clyde Barrow's .45-caliber Colt Model 1911 were the biggest-ticket items in a $1.1million auction of 134 artifacts in Nashua, New Hampshire.

About two-thirds of the auctioned 
items were from Bonnie and Clyde, but items also came from other 
notorious criminals, including Al Capone, Pretty Boy Floyd and John 
Dillinger.

Bonnie's snub-nosed Colt revolver was
discovered taped to her thigh when she was killed in Louisiana. It drew
the highest bid and sold for $264,000, said Bobby Livingston, vice 
president of RR Auction in Amherst, New Hampshire, which held the 
auction.

Clyde Model 1911 automatic sold for $240,000 to the same bidder, who didn't want to be named, Mr Livingston said.

'When rare items like that come up 
for sale you expect this kind of enthusiasm,' Livingston said. 'There 
was some serious bidding going on.'

Many of the auction items came from 
the estate of the late collector Robert Davis of Waco, Texas, with the 
remainder coming from various other collections.

Most of the items came from famous 
gangsters and outlaws, but some were linked to law enforcement officials
including Elliot Ness and Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, who led a posse 
that tracked down and killed Bonnie and Clyde in Louisiana.

Clyde's pocket watch sold for 
$36,000, Mr Livingston said. A 1921 Morgan silver dollar that was found 
in his pocket after he was killed sold for $32,000

Also in the auction was a letter that Clyde wrote to his brother L.C. Barrow on the back of a photo showing a house on a platform surrounded by water. He signed it "bud," his code name when he was on the run.

FBI files say Bonnie and Clyde met in Texas in 1930 and were believed to have committed 13 murders and several robberies and burglaries by the time they died. Law enforcement officials were among their victims. The duo became infamous as they traveled across America's Midwest and South, holding up banks and stores with other gang members.

Texas Ranger Frank Hamer led the posse of six lawmen who carried out the ambush, and auction officials said authorities gifted him the guns from the lovers' bodies as part of his compensation for the operation.

Jonathan Davis, whose book "Bonnie & Clyde & Marie: A Sister's Perspective on the Notorious Barrow Gang" is expected out shortly, befriended Marie Barrow in the early 1990s and is acting as an advisor for the auction.

He said Thursday that people are drawn to Bonnie and Clyde memorabilia because of the romantic aspect of their story and because there's always an interest in outlaws.

L.J. Hinton, the son of a Texas deputy sheriff who was part of the ambush, shared a similar view Thursday. Besides the outlaws' love story, he said people also have been fascinated by Bonnie and Clyde because they became Robin Hood-like characters by robbing banks during the Depression.

The 78-year-old retired law-enforcement official manages the Bonnie & Clyde Ambush Museum in Gibsland, Louisiana, the town where the takedown happened.

He predicted the September auction will attract a lot of interest.

'Just hang on to your hat, because it will be a bidding war,' he said.

A Colt .45 SAA revolver that belonged to Robert LeRoy Parker, better known as Butch Cassidy

A .45-caliber gun once owned by Butch Cassidy has sold at auction in Southern California for $175,000.

The private seller said that the Colt Single Action Army revolver went to an anonymous online bidder.

The gun is accompanied by a black leather shoulder holster and two binders filled with documentation verifying the revolver's   authenticity.

Cassidy, the infamous Old West bank robber, bought the revolver in a hardware store in Vernal, Utah, in 1896. 

He turned it over to Utah authorities in early 1900 in an unsuccessful attempt to gain amnesty. 

Known as the 'Amnesty Colt,' it is the most documented of Cassidy's guns.

The outlaw was immortalized in the 1969 film 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. 'He was played by Paul Newman.

Sunday's sale was held by California Auctioneers of Ventura.
