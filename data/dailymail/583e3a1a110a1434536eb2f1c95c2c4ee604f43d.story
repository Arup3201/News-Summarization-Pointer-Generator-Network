A husband celebrating his 72nd wedding anniversary has revealed the secret to his long marriage - saying 'yes, dear'.

Inseparable Aquilla and Catherine Brant - aged 99 and 95 - met in 1939 on the day World War Two broke out.

Aquilla, whose name is Latin for eagle, was in the St John Ambulance and was called to train others in lifesaving skills.

Aquilla and Catherine Brant, aged 99 and 95, have been married for 72 years, and now live together in a double room at Pilling House residential home in Skelmanthorpe

The retired electrician was training a group of 12 men at a fever hospital in Dalton, West Yorks., where the future love of his life was working as a nurse.

When Aquilla needed some tea and sugar and was told to find Catherine to help him out they fell for each other.

He said: 'Yes, it was love at first sight. She was beautiful and still is.

'We just love each other. Of course we’ve had our ups and downs like everybody else and someone once asked me how we’d stayed together so long.

'I told them it was two little words: "Yes, dear".'

The pair went on to have three children, (L-R) Susan, Carl and Hazel, followed by two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren

The pair met at the very start of World War II when Aquilla came to the hospital where Catherine was working as a nurse (pictured)

Aquilla, pictured in his army uniform in Germany, 1946, says meeting Catherine was love at first sight: 'She was beautiful and still is'

He added that they rarely had a cross word and if they did they always sorted it out.

The aged lovebirds, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, now share an double room at Pilling House residential home in Skelmanthorpe.

Aquilla, who will turn 100 in December, said: 'We try to argue things out and agree about it at the end. We’ve never come to any blows.

'We have always lived harmoniously and Catherine is very understanding and loves everybody, even her enemies.'

Former nurse Catherine, who will be 96 next month, said: 'You shouldn’t hate anybody. You should pray for your enemies, and it’s surprising how they will react when you do that.

'I love people and Aquilla doesn’t love people as much. He’ll say: "Oh, is she coming again?"'

The romantics married on April 8, 1942 at Almondbury Church before spending a few days on honeymoon in Ilkley, West Yorkshire.

Aquilla, here with Catherine in France, says he tells those who ask the secret to their marital bliss that it is 'saying "yes dear"

They have been back to spa town since, trying to re-trace their steps, but were disappointed not to find where they stayed.

'We saw lambs being born and Aquilla leaned back and broke a chair but we never told anybody,' smiled Catherine.

By the time of his wedding Aquilla had been called up into the Army while his wife continued working as a nurse.

When he was demobbed in 1946 he started work at a chemicals plant, he later moved to work for many years at a power station, where he was a maintenance electrician.

The pair are still obviously in love, with Aquilla saying that Catherine 'loves everybody', while Catherine gushes that Aquilla can 'fix anything'

Catherine worked as a nurse until she left to bring up her family.

The couple went on to have three children Carl, Susan and Hazel, two grandchildren John and Amanda and four great-grandchildren Tom, Sam, Alexandra and William.

Surrounded by his wooden carvings in their room Catherine said Aquilla could mend anything.

'There was nothing he couldn’t do. He must have saved us so much money over the years.

'If a pan handle broke I would look forward to getting something new but he would get his soldering iron out and he would repair it.

'He has even made his own false teeth but that’s another story. I’ll tell you  that when he’s 100,' said Catherine.
