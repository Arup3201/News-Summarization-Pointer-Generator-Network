Ever shaved in a rush and left the house with a wonky beard?

Time-poor men, meet your new best friend: The GoateeSaver - an adjustable template that allows you to shave around a goatee pattern quickly and evenly every morning.

The £12.99 device is made with a mouthpiece for biting on to help keep the GoateeSaver held firmly against the face whilst you shave around the template.

Useful or weird? Say hello to the GoateeSaver, a £12.99 mouthpiece that helps men avoid getting a wonky beard when they shave

It has three adjustable sizes so it fits different face shapes and creates a range of goatee styles.

The intriguing male grooming product is the brainchild of inventor Scott Bonge and his wife Christy from Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.

The device, which has been likened to Hannibal Lecter’s mouthpiece, was born out of Scott’s personal need to keep his goatee looking straight, even and professional.

He began looking for a product of this nature while in college but failed to find anything so decided to create one himself.

Personal need: The intriguing male grooming 
product is the brainchild of inventor and owner, Scott Bonge, who 
searched for something similar. After failing to find anything, four years ago he created 
it himself

The GoateeSaver’s first design was made with modelling clay and Popsicle sticks.

After five years of making and testing prototype after prototype and being tested by independent labs to ensure the safety and functionality of the product, the GoateeSaver, now made of plastic, was launched four years ago and is now sold worldwide.

‘It is our sincere hope that the GoateeSaver will become a vital part of your morning shaving routine,' said a spokesman for the company. 

‘We are confident that it will reduce your goatee grooming time, and give your goatee a sharp distinguished look.’
