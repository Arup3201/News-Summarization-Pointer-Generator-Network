Maha Shagroon, pictured outside court, is arguing that her seven-year marriage was valid

When a couple divorce, a row over who gets the family home, pets or even the record collection is to be expected.

But for Maha Shagroon and her billionaire ex-husband Adnan Sharbatly, the stakes are a little higher.

She claims he has breached their 
divorce settlement by failing to maintain her two luxury homes, cutting 
her number of servants and refusing to pay her head chef’s salary.

Now she is demanding her Saudi 
Arabian ex increases her maintenance payments, improves their £5million 
London mansion and replaces her fleet of cars every three years.

Mr Sharbatly, 66, married Mrs 
Shagroon, 47, at London’s Intercontinental Hotel in 1994 in an Islamic 
ceremony presided over by an imam.

They were together for seven years 
and had three children but the relationship broke down in 2001, leading
to acrimonious divorce proceedings.

Their differences appeared to have 
been resolved by a ‘compromise’ hammered out in 2002, which made 
financial provision for Mrs Shagroon.

It also guaranteed her home in 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, would be well maintained, allowed her the run of 
the couple’s Regent’s Park mansion in the summer and agreed some of her 
staff costs would be paid.

But the Court of Appeal heard a list 
of complaints from Mrs Shagroon including claims Mr Sharbatly had not 
dealt with septic tank leaks or maintained the air conditioning at her 
Jeddah home.

She also claims he refused to pay the
salaries of the house’s watchman and head chef and cut the assistant 
chef’s pay and the number of housemaids.

Nicholas Cusworth QC, for Mrs 
Shagroon, said her ex-husband was ‘enormously wealthy’ although the true
scale of his riches had never been probed.

He added that she had estimated her 
husband’s wealth, from his thriving Saudi Arabian business empire, as 
anywhere between £100m and £1billion in 2001.

Their dispute hinges on Mr 
Sharbatly’s claims that both their Islamic marriage and divorce were 
invalid under English law, which he says means English courts have no 
business intervening in their affairs.

But a family judge rejected this claim in March this year.

Mrs Shagroon says her marriage ended 
in March 2002 when her husband ‘pronounced talaq’, the equivalent of 
divorce proceedings under Islamic law.

But James Turner QC, for Mr 
Sharbatly, said their wedding could not be recognised because he was 
already married at the time under Islamic law and therefore the talaq 
dissolving it was also void.

In effect, there was ‘never a marriage’, he claimed.

Mr Cusworth said Mrs Shagroon was not
trying to get a bigger slice of her ex-husband’s fortune but was trying
to ‘regularise’ her position.

The three judges hearing the case have now reserved their decision until a later date.

Maha Shagroon argues that her husband Adnan Sharbatly has failed to keep his side of the bargain in their divorce settlement

But he claims they were never lawfully married in England as he already had a wife under Islamic law

He therefore believes their dispute is private and nothing to do with the courts

Judges ruled their marriage was valid, but the father has now taken his case it to the Court of Appeal
