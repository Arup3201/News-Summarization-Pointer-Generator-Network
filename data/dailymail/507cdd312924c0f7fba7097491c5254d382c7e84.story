When Anoop Kapitan left his home in South Africa to come to the UK in 1970, he had no idea it would be the last time he would see his brother for more than four decades.

Anoop moved to Glasgow aged 20 to study at Strathclye University, but just a few years later his elder brother Karan moved to Australia, where he set up an accountancy firm.

The pair kept in touch via letter, and then email, but had not seen each other face to face for 44 year until they met in Melbourne in December.

Anoop had virtually given up hope of seeing his relative again after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, when doctors told him he only had ten years of normal life left.

Anoop studied in Glasgow before settling in Yorkshire, while Karan moved to Melbourne. When Anoop was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1999, he virtually gave up hope of seeing his brother again

Mr Kapitan said: 'My elder brother is in his late seventies now. He emigrated to Australia where he lived his life, and I lived my life in the UK. 

'We both led very hectic lives – I travelled a lot with my job as a troubleshooting engineer for a big company, whilst Karan was busy establishing a successful accountancy firm in Melbourne. 

'Up until this point, neither of us had the time to reconnect.

'I have travelled to 49 countries around the world including North Thailand and Turkey, so this landmark trip to Australia marked my fiftieth country.'

Anoop grew up in his family home in Johannesburg where his parents ran the famous Kapitan's restaurant which was visited by Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie.

Aged 20 he left to study in Glasgow, before settling in Holmfirth, Yorkshire, where he raised a family and now has two children.

Anoop travelled to 49 different countries as part of his job as an engineer, but had never been to Australia until he was reunited with Karan after more than four decades

A few years after he departed South Africa his brother Karan also left the family home, but he went the opposite way, travelling to Melbourne where he started a business.

In 1999, while Anoop was only in his Forties, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and given just ten years to live a normal life, so he never expected to see his relative again.

But Qatar Airways and Manchester Airport arranged a flight for him to Melborne, where the pair were tearfully reunited in December last year.

Anoop added: 'I longed to be with family again. I don't know what kind of man I will find when I get to Australia, but I will do my utmost to win his heart again.

'I was apprehensive before meeting Karan and felt nervous and a bit overwhelmed, but when I saw him standing there at the arrivals gate all my worries just disappeared. 

'In the end, we just hugged each other – words weren’t necessary.'
