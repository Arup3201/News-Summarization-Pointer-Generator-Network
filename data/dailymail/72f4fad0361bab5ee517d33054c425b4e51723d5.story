A controversial online tournament where boys pit their female classmates against each other and vote who is the best looking is facing calls to close amid accusations of bullying and sexism.

May Madness is the name of the Facebook page where the girls of Washington's Issaquah High School are judged and encouraged to 'look their finest' throughout the month of voting.

The anonymous creators and operators of 
May Madness post 64 yearbook-style photographs for the one-on-one voting
and a girls name and picture can be entered into the contest without 
her permission.

Bullying: The controversial Facebook page of May Madness allows students of Issaquah High School to vote who the hottest girl student is for 2013

Designed to resemble the brackets of 
basketball's March Madness, each girl eliminates their designated 
opponent until they reach the final rounds where the winner of the 
competition which has been running for five years is decided.

Last year the dubious tournament was shut down when parents complained to the police about offensive comments placed under pictures of the girls, which is a crime in Washington state.

However, this year the organizers have made it more difficult to post profane comments and are also exercising their 1st amendment rights by keeping the website running.

District spokeswoman Sarah Niegowski said the contest 'doesn't feel good' to anyone.

Issaquah High School tried to shut down the May Madness website last year - but this year the student operators have banned offensive comments and brushed up on their 1st amendment rights

'These are pretty smart folks behind this,' Niegowski said. 'They know their First Amendment rights. They're very quiet about who it is and the group behind it.'

School officials at Issaquah have said that this year they are monitoring the site for any signs it has stepped over the line - while it is doing all it can to discourage people from taking part.

However, some fear that the damage has already been done.

'Almost every teenage girl has self-esteem issues,' added student Tristan Robinson to King5.com.

'And doing something like that is absolutely ridiculous.'

The school has admitted that unless legal boundaries are crossed there is little they can do to stop May Madness as the tournament is held off school grounds and if the girls keep their clothes on then no dress code rules are being broken.

Most students of Issaquah High School were critical of the website May Madness - believing it to be sexist and dangerous to the self-esteem of girls at the school

The website can not be shut down because the voting does not take place on school property and the girls are not in any states of undress

'This kind of thing is sexualizing us girls like we're some sort of trophy,' said sophomore Devon Keller to King5.com.

Last year, the May Madness page had a direct link to the brackets and voting, but this year that is not readily accesible to the public.

Sarah Niegowski said in an interview with the Seattle Times that the concept 'preys on a lot of insecurities that already exist in adolescents'.

So far, police haven't received any criminal complaints about May Madness, but aren't anticipating any either.

Some stood up for the organizers of May Madness though.

'They’re (contestants) not just like these hollow, shells of women who 
are just there to be objectified sexually,' said Issaquah senior Tiffany
Han to Q13Fox.com.

'We know them personally and they’re smart, funny, and we know 
they have their personalities.'
