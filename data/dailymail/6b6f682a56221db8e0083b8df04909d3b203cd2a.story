In its zealousness to make amends with veterans whose health needs had been ignored, a Veterans Affairs hospital in Massachusetts accidentally reached out to a deceased, Vietnam veteran who passed away two years ago while waiting for care from the VA, a news report revealed yesterday.

Suzanne Chase, a resident of Acton, Massachusetts, told CBS Boston on Monday that her dead husband received a letter in the mail two weeks ago from a local VA hospital informing him it was ready to fulfill the appointment he requested in 2012.

'I was in complete disbelief,' she said. 'It was 22 months too late, I kind of thought I was in the Twilight Zone when I opened this letter and read it.'

It took the VA two years to contact the Vietnam veteran pictured here. This portrait of Douglas Chase was provided to CBS Boston by his widow

Chase's husband, Douglas, died in the summer of 2012 from a brain tumor several months after his wife put in a request to have his care moved from a hospital in Boston to a nearby VA hospital in Bedford.

'It was so difficult for him to take the ambulance ride into Boston,' she told CBS. 'We wanted to be closer.'

But the VA never called, and her husband passed away in August of that year.

At that time Chase says she contacted the government agency and asked it to carry out her husband's burial. The VA reportedly told her it wouldn't assume the costs because her husband was never treated at a VA hospital.

'It is absurd,' the Massachusetts resident told CBS Boston. 'It made me angry because I just don’t think our veterans should be treated this way.'

Then, two weeks ago, Chase received the VA's about her deceased husband's long overdue doctor's appointment.

'I was like you have to be kidding, right,' she told the news station.

Chase said she tried contacting the Bedford VA hospital immediately after opening the letter but never received a response.

Only after CBS reported on the tragic misstep did the VA issue attempt to apologize for the tragic misstep.

'We regret any distress our actions caused to the Veteran’s widow and family,' a statement from the VA to CBS read in part. 'Thank you for bringing this regrettable issue to our attention.'

The department said it could not legally release details on the Douglas Chase's case but it confirmed that acting the acting Veterans Affairs director had called Suzanne Chase to apologize for the oversight and left a voicemail when he couldn't reach her.

Chase told CBS she did not receive a voicemail from anyone at the VA headquarters but an employee of the hospital that made the initial error contacted her.

Suzanne Chase said she was 'shocked' when she opened a letter from the VA two weeks that said it was finally ready to see her husband

As part of a nationwide apology tour in the wake of an appointment scheduling scandal, the Veterans Affairs Department is contacting the backlog of veterans who were put on secret waiting lists by VA hospitals trying to cover up long wait times.

An internal VA audit of 731 medical facilities that was completed last month found that 56,000 veterans seeking care waited more than 90 days for initial appointments at VA hospitals, and more
 than 10 percent waited more than 
30 days, contradicting official reports that showed them waiting on average two weeks to a month.

A separate report filed by Sen. Tom Coburn last month showed that 1,000 veterans died throughout the last decade as a result of VA mismanagement.

When veterans died before VA doctors made time to see them, hospital staff would claim that care was 'no longer necessary' rather than saying that the veteran had passed away, a scheduler for one of the hospitals caught up in the scandal told CNN last week.

'I am 
hoping if other people speak out, they can improve the system, so no one
 else dies waiting for an appointment,' Suzanne Chase told CBS yesterday.

In a report to the president last month 
acting VA secretary Sloan Gibson said the VA had already reached out to 70,000 veterans to offer them appointments, 'but there is still much more work to be done.'

The Veterans Affairs Department recently found out VA hospitals were regularly lying about how long it was taking for doctors to see vets

It's now on a crusade to clear the backlog of veterans who need care and has contacted more than 70,000 veterans  throughout the last month and a half to schedule appointments
