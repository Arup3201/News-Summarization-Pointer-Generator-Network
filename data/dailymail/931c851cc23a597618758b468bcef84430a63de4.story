If you're one of those people who wake up in the middle of the night and reach for the phone then you're not alone.

A recent survey from the  Sleep Health Foundation has found that rather than being a place of rest and intimacy, the bedroom is becoming more like an office due to the amount of electronics in it.

Out of the of 1,500 people studied, a whopping 45 per cent regularly take a laptop, electronic device or watch TV in bed, hindering their chances of some quality shut-eye.

A recent study of 1,500 people by the Sleep Health Foundation and led by Professor Dorothy Bruck found 45 per cent  regularly take a laptop, electronic device or watch TV in bed, hindering their chances of quality sleep

But as well as disturbances from alerts, texts and telephone calls, the blue light from the screen can block the hormone melatonin, which encourages the body to relax and sleep. 

The foundation's sleep psychologist Professor Dorothy Bruck says: 'A standard guideline for good sleep is that the bed should be reserved for sleep and intimacy only.

'So it was alarming to learn that so many people were using their sleep sanctuary to email, cruise the web and watch movies, all activities that are not conducive to sleep.'

Animals are a big no and should be banned from the bed and bedroom if they are noisy says Professor Bruck

Professor Bruck says that Australians are not taking their sleep seriously enough which is worrying as being over-wrought and sleep deprived can cause illnesses and hazards.

As well as the obvious risks with operating machinery and driving, those with regular fragmented sleep are more at risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

Lack of sleep has also been linked to depression and weight problems like obesity.

'Solutions exist for many of these disturbances but this data reflects a widespread failure to prioritise sleep,' adds Professor Bruck. 

Professor Bruck says try to avoid using your phone or computer within one hour of bedtime as the blue screen will suppress the hormone that makes us sleepy. She also says to cut back on coffee

Interestingly, 70 per cent of those studied said they 'often look at the clock' when they wake up during the night but it's not clear whether it's a quick glance or clock watching.

The latter leaves those with fragmented sleep agitated and frustrated, which in turn causes more disturbance and those struggling to drop off are advised to to cover the clock.

'A quiet and comfortable bedroom environment is an obvious prerequisite for maximising sleep quality, adds Professor Bruck. 

More than 70 per cent of those studied said they 'often look at the clock' when they wake up during the night

'Great sleep relies on a quiet room, a relaxed mind and a comfortable bed.

'But you'd be surprised how many people ignore these important guidelines and snuggle up with their iPhone in their overheated bedroom after drinking too many glasses of wine.'

The survey showed that 22 per cent believe they drink too much alcohol, a quarter admitted drinking coffee after 2pm and more than a third confessed to not winding down before hopping into bed.

Make it stop: Lack of sleep can cause arguments, frustration, anxiety and magnify whatever bad is happening

'Lots of people believe coffee doesn't affect their sleep but research proves it actually makes deep sleep lighter up to 14 hours after it's consumed,' adds Professor Bruck.

'Likewise alcohol. It might seem like that tipple is making you relaxed but it will actually make the second half of your night's sleep more fragmented.'

Four in ten blamed a snoring partner for their lack of sleep while others said they were kept awake or aggravated by noisy pets, the temperature and uncomfortable clothing and bedding. 

1. Have a regular sleep pattern. Try to go to bed at the same time every evening and get up at the same time every morning. This will help your body to work out a healthy sleep routine.

2. Spend the right amount of time in bed. Most adults need about 8 hours sleep every night. Some require more and some less. Many poor sleepers spend much more than 8 hours in bed and this makes fragmented sleep a habit. Except if you have lengthy sleep requirements, limit your time in bed to no more than 8.5 hours. If you often take hours to fall asleep, go to bed later. Remember that children need more sleep than adults.

3. Bed is for sleeping, not entertainment. Ditch the TVs, mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices. Your mind needs to be in the habit of knowing that if you are in bed, you are there to sleep. Don't stay in bed if you are wide awake.

4. Wind down and relax before going to bed. Have a buffer zone before bedtime. Sort out any problems before going to bed or allocate a 'worry time' during the day to go over the day's activities and work out a plan of action for the next day. Try to avoid using your computer within one hour of bedtime as the blue screen will suppress the hormone that makes us sleepy. Don't exercise too late in the evening. Find a relaxation technique that works for you.

5. Make sure your bedroom is comfortable. You should have a quiet, dark room with comfortable bedding and good temperature control.
