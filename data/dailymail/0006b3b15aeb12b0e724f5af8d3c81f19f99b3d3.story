The search for a 21-year-old Colorado woman who went missing in January while on a Grand Canyon rafting trip came to a tragic conclusion this week.

According to a National Park Service press release, the body of a woman that was spotted in the Colorado River March 21 has been identified as Kaitlin Anne Kenney.

The 21-year-old Englewood resident was last seen on the night of January 11 at a rafting camp. It was Kenney's first and last trip to the Grand Canyon.

Worst fear confirmed: Officials have announced that the body found in the Colorado River in late March is that of Kaitlin Anne Kenney, 21, who went missing in January

Gone: Kenny was rafting through the Grand Canyon's waterways when she vanished without a trace

At the time of her disappearance, 
Kenney's mother said she feared that her daughter had accidentally 
fallen into the frigid water while going to the bathroom in the dark.

It
was below zero the night Kenney disappeared, and the 21-year-old woman 
did not have her coat on at the time, according to her family, The Denver Channel reported.

Helicopter
and ground search parties scoured the Tapeats and Deer Creek drainages,
Surprise Valley and along the Colorado River for two days after Kenney 
was reported missing, but to no avail.   

The
body spotted by rafters at about river mile 165 near Tuckup Canyon was 
taken by helicopter to a medical examiner, who confirmed that it was 
Kenney.     

Last week, Kenney's mother, Linnea, wrote on Facebook about getting the news that her daughter's remains have been recovered.

'She
was a source of love, joy and friendship to so many,' Linnea Kenney 
wrote. 'We are very grateful to the many professionals from the Grand 
Canyon National Park and the river rafting community for everything they
did to find Kaitlin. Thanks to them for bringing her home to us.'

Searching: Kenney was last seen wearing a tan coat and tan pants, a grey shirt, multi-colored scarf, black knit cap and hiking boots

Kenney, an anthropology major at University of Montana, was a talented musician who won first place in the young adult category at the 2011 Colorado Fiddle Championships.

Her mother wrote on Facebook after her disappearance: 'She was our balloon let loose in a room and lived life to it's 
fullest, always with a smile. We were blessed to have her in our lives.'

'She shared her spark of life and her 
beauty and her kindness and free spirit with everybody,' she told 
reporters. 'She never did anything that was ordinary and she was always 
out there and willing to explore.'

Kenney was on a month-long rafting trip with a dozen friends through the Grand Canyon during winter break. The plan was for the campers to float 280 miles from Lee’s Ferry to Pearce Ferry.

The young woman decided to go on the fateful trip after completing a summer semester with the Wild Rockies Filed Institute, which had sparked her interest to further explore the great outdoors, according to The Montana Kaimin.

Free spirit: Kenney was an anthropology major at University of Montana and an accomplished musician who played the fiddle and the mandolin

Life cut short: Kenney was passionate about the great outdoors and was excited to go on the 280-mile rafting trip, her first ever, which coincided with her 21st birthday 

in anticipation of her great adventure, the college student spoke with exuberance to her friends about leading the life of a 'river rat' and surviving in the wilderness.

An accomplished musician, Kenney would talk about how she needed to bring her mandolin along on the rating trip, which coincided with her 21st birthday.

'She was never one to shy away from challenges and the outdoors,' Linnea Kenney told the paper of her daughter. 'The Grand Canyon trip was an adventure she wanted to experience.'
