A woman who gets teased by her daughter for her Teesside accent and dialect has created a Smoggie dictionary to help her friends understand her.

Nichola Ridley, 25, who grew up in Middlesbrough and moved nearly 40 miles away to Gateshead five years ago, says she still finds herself having to repeat words because people are not familiar with her dialect.

Now, Miss Ridley, who runs her own cleaning business, has compiled a list of Teesside words with translations into Standard English on her blog - and has had responses from all over the world from homesick expats.

Nichola Ridley, 25, moved from her native Middlesbrough to Gateshead and has written her own Smoggie Dictionary to help friends understand the differences between the two dialects

'I often have to repeat myself in the 
shop or in the taxi or wherever and there's loads of things I don't 
quite get that people say here, despite living on Tyneside for five 
years,' she said.

Smoggie is a nickname for people from Teesside that was coined because of the industrial nature of the area.

It was first used as a derogatory term, but now many people proudly call themselves Smoggies, including supporters of Middlesbrough FC and local MP Tom Blenkinsop, who used it in a parliamentary speech in 2011.

Miss Ridley's daughter, Emily Rose, seven, has grown up in Dunston, Gateshead and the pair have fun comparing the differences between their dialects, with Emily Rose even recording a video for the blog to show what she means.

'My little girl mocks me and makes me say "bird" and "bed" in my accent because she says they sound exactly the same,' she said.

Within two days of publishing the post in her Bridget in the North blog, inspired by Bridget Jones's Diary, it had been viewed more than 60,000 times and shared more than 10,000 on Facebook.

Miss Ridley said: 'I wrote it and it just exploded all over the place.

'I have had people from Australia and Thailand and all over sending me messages saying the dictionary makes them homesick.'

Miss Ridley says her favourite saying is 'now then', meaning 'hello'.

'People up here have no idea what you mean and say, "ah, you mean 'Aal reet,"' she said.

'Some of the dictionary isn't actual words, it's things like we might say "tortured" meaning "pester", whereas up here it's the more serious word.

'The other thing is we'd say, "shot us that over here", for 'throw that over here.

'Up here, they'd say "hoy it ower here".'

Miss Ridley is also considering producing a Smoggie dictionary pamphlet for sale to support Home Start Teesside, a charity that helps families in crisis.
