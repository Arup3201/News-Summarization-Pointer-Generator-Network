They have been using Facebook and Twitter to devastating effect - even hijacking people's innocent tweets to spread their message of propaganda.

And now social media users are giving ISIS a taste of its own medicine -  by mounting a series of campaigns poking fun at the group.

In recent weeks, a wave of tongue-in-cheek virals ridiculing the terrorist organisation have been sweeping across the internet.

Lee Hurst began the hashtag #AskIslamicState, which thousands of Twitter users had soon employed to poke fun at ISIS

Under the hashtag, one user asked: 'Did you cry when Patrick Swayze died in GHOST?' 

While some criticise the trends as insensitive, others say it is a way to intimidate the extremist group 

Recent attempts to mock the jihadists include the Twitter hashtags #ISISmovies - which saw users come up with spoof film titles ridiculing the group  - and #AskIslamicState, which saw users pose satirical questions to the group in the manner of a political Q&A.

As the group continue their brutal offensive, while promoting their actions online - including posting sickening footage of beheadings and crucifixions - some have criticised the humorous take on the group as insensitive.

But others say it is a way to fight back at the Islamic State and make a small dent in their overwhelming social media presence.

As the #ISISmovies trend swept over Twitter, Libyan-American writer Hend Amry wrote: 'Sometimes, you have to mock, to belittle. Because sometimes, belittlement is your enemy's greatest fear.' 

The  hashtag #AskIslamicState - which trended last week - was started by comedian Lee Hurst who wrote: '#AskIslamicState When do you expect the Caliphate to be opened up for tourism?'

He later tweeted: '#AskIslamicState I'm thinking of visiting, but hate the idea of missing Celebrity Big Brother. Do you show it?'

Earlier this month, under #ISISmovies, users re-wrote famous film titles using an Islamic State undertone

'Return of the Jihadi' (above), based on the Star Wars movie and 'Stoned' (below), the 2005 film about the Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones, were also tweeted by several users to mock the group 

The spoof cover of Vogue which surfaced online was poking fun at the group's own magazine

Soon, thousands of Twitter users had joined in with tweets. These included: '#AskIslamicState Did you cry when Patrick Swazye died in GHOST?'

One user tweeted: “#AskIslamicState Would you recommend a Burgundy or a Rhone to go with a pig’s liver & bacon casserole?;

While another wrote: “#AskIslamicState Do you think roller blinds are more effective than venetian blinds for blocking out lights ?”

As the trend gathered pace, Mens Rea tweeted: 'The great thing about Twitter is nobody is safe from Trolling, even Global, Violent, Hell-Bent Jihadists [sic].'

Under #ISISmovies, users re-wrote famous film titles, but with an Islamic State undertone.

One of those included 'To Kill a Mocking Kurd' - a take on the book, play and film To Kill a Mocking Bird.

'Return of the Jihadi', based on the Star Wars movie and 'Stoned', the 2005 film about the Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones, were also tweeted by several users. 

In another online satire, Twitter users mocked up a 'Jihadi Vogue' spoof magazine cover, making fun of the group's own magazine.

Earlier this month, Americans also clubbed together online to reverse one of ISIS's hastags #AMessageFromISIStoUS. It soon became #AMessageFromUStoISIS. 

ISIS has used online propaganda in its efforts. Rather than using a single hashtag to deliver its message, the group has instead hijacked other hashtags, including those used by World Cup fans

ISIS has used online propaganda in its efforts to spread its message. But rather than using a single hashtag to deliver its message, the group has instead hijacked other hashtags, including those used by World Cup fans.

The group has also used hashtags to attack prominent figures. Previously, ISIS tweeted a picture of first lady Michelle Obama holding a sign that initially showed the hashtag #bringbackourgirls – a reference to the more than 200 kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls.

That was the edited to say #bringbackourhumvee, a dig at the American-supplied Humvees captured by ISIS in northern Iraq.
