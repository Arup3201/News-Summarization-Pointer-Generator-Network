Michael Johnson will return to Cincinnati after an injury-hit year with Tampa Bay.

The defensive end, 28, put pen to paper on a four-year deal, $20million deal.

With $6m guaranteed this year, Johnson will also receive $7m from his $43.8m deal with the Buccaneers, ESPN report.

A third round pick in 2009, Johnson spent his first five years with the Bengals but joined the Buccaneers on a big-money deal last year.

Marvin Lewis made it a priority to bring Michael Johnson back to Cincinnati to bolster their pass rush

But his productivity was hindered by injuries, with just four sacks in 14 games.

Consequently, he joined Josh McCown and Anthony Collis on general manager Jason Licht's unwanted list. The move frees up $2m cap space.

'I'm thankful for the Buccaneers giving me an opportunity to come down there and learn,' Johnson said on a conference call. 'I'm going to always cherish all of the memories - the highs and the lows. You can't appreciate the highs without the lows.'

'This last year was a character-building year. I don't count it as a bad year. So I come back to Cincinnati with a different mindset and a different outlook on things.'

Johnson was also coveted by the Minnesota Vikings, but chose not to be reunited with the Bengals' former defensive co-ordinator Mike Zimmer.
