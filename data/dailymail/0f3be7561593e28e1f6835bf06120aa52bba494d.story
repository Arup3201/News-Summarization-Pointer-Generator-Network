The elderly CEO of an oil company has been given a $100 million pay out - even though he isn't leaving the company.

Eugene M Isenberg, 81, has been chairman and  chief executive of
the oil-drilling company Nabors Industries
Ltd since 1987.

It was announced last week that Mr Isenberg would be promoting his second in command, 57-year-old Anthony G. Petrello, to CEO of the Bermuda-based company, but
that he would also remain in his job as chairman.

Sweet deal: Eugene M Isenberg, 81, who lives in Palm Beach, walks away with $100 million in severance pay from oil company Nabors but will stay on as chairman

The power shift means that a clause in Mr Isenberg's employment contract will give him $100 million.

The amount is less than he was originally entitled to, $264 million, after shareholders complained several years ago about the exorbitant sum.

Mr Isenberg, who is already worth $750 million, would not have been entitled to the payout had he retired or resigned.

The 81-year-old lives in Palm Beach, Florida and has commuted to the company's operational headquarters in Austin, Texas.

He also has homes in New York and Martha's Vineyard.

The company has yet to comment on when Mr Isenberg will receive his payout. According to the Wall Street Journal, the payment is more than the company made in the third quarter which was $74.3 million on revenue of $1.66 billion.

In 2009, the Corporate Library listed Mr Isenberg as one of the highest paid, worst performing U.S. executives. In 2011, Nabors stock fell 19 per cent.

In a statement on his company's website, Mr Isenberg said: 'I have complete 
confidence that Tony is the right person to take over as CEO.

'We have 
worked closely together for 20 years, and he has a deep knowledge of the
Company's operations and strategy.

'He is well positioned to lead the 
Company as CEO moving forward. I believe the Company's brightest and 
most successful days are ahead of it.'

Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, told the Wall Street Journal: 'I think shareholders will have some issues.

'From an outside standpoint this doesn't seem to be a severance event.'

Eugene Isenberg has been in charge of Nabors since 1987 when the company, which was started in Alaska, was coming back from bankruptcy.

He began his career at another oil and gas company Exxon and was formerly head of a steel trading company Genimar Inc.

He has served as Governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers from 1998 to 2006 and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) until 2005.

He is also the President of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Foundation and a major donor to the college where he was once a student.

Booming business: Mr Isenberg has made a fortune from a long career in the oil industry and is said to be worth $750 million

His successor Anthony Petrello, who attended Harvard law school, has been on the board of directors at Nabors since 1991. 

Last year, the company had a net income of $300 million. The Nabors companies own 491 land drilling rigs
and 749 well-servicing rigs in the U.S and participate in most of the significant oil and gas markets in the world.

Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rules concerning shareholder approval of compensation for company executives and so-called 'golden parachute' arrangements.

From January 2011, the new rules say that 'say-on-pay' votes for shareholders must take place every three years.

However the SEC also adopted a temporary exemption for smaller companies which will not be required to abide by the voting rules until 2013.
