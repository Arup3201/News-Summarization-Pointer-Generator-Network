Public outcry today led to the removal of a Princess Diana film poster placed at the exact spot where she was killed in a car accident.

There was widespread fury at the decision to put the advertisement for ‘Diana’, which stars Naomi Watts, in such an insensitive place.

But workmen were seen today removing it from above the Pont de l’Alma tunnel, in central Paris, after the movie’s distributor was shamed into action.

Fury: A 'Diana' film poster placed where the princess died has been pulled down after a public outcry

A source at Le Pacte told French news agency AFP: ‘We asked for the removal of this poster after controversy in the British media.’ 

The 6ft x 4ft hoarding was directly above the underpass where a Mercedes Diana was travelling in ploughed into a wall in August 1997.

Rosa Monckton, for many years one of Diana’s closest confidantes, was among those who attacked the ‘shameless attempt to publicise a film that should never have been made.’

She said the placing of the poster above the Alma tunnel was ‘despicable’ and ‘disgusting’.

 remains hugely popular in Paris, where she is still referred to as 
‘Lady D.’, but the film about her has already been panned by critics in 
France and Britain.

Jerome Garcin, of the Nouvel Observateur, said it was impossible to imagine anything ‘more stupid, more ugly’.

The film is loosely based on the romance Diana had with Dr Hasnat Khan, which ended in 1997, just before she died alongside another boyfriend, Dodi Al-Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul.

Paul was later found to have been drink-driving, and pursuing paparazzi photographers were also partially blamed for the deaths, although conspiracy theories about a murder plot persist to this day.

The source at Le Pacte said the Alma poster was one of around 1000 which had been placed around Paris, and the rest would remain in place.
