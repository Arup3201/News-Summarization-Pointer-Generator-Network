She has been spotted getting up close and personal to Prince Andrew  - and has dated Hollywood star George Clooney - but 'down to earth' Monika Jakisic lives at home with her parents, MailOnline can reveal.

The 34-year-old swimwear model - who was this week pictured without make-up and wearing sweats as she strolled in the London sunshine -  is rumored to have been dating Prince Andrew, who at 54 is is 20 years her senior.

The brunette was pictured affectionately kissing the Duke of York goodnight after their third dinner date in as many weeks earlier this month.

But while the Duke of York lives in luxury at the Royal Lodge in the grounds of Windsor Great Park, previously inhabited by the Queen Mother, Monika lives with her parents Maria, said to work as a cleaner, and Zdarvko, who is believed to be unemployed due to his bad back, in a $830,000 former council house in North London.

Monika - who we can reveal was close to George Clooney up until late last year when they were pictured embracing - and her family bought their three-storey terraced home in December 2007 and neighbours 
say they have been at the property for more than 10 years.

She is listed on the British Land Registry document with her parents and brother Marin.

Title documents held by the Land Registry state: 'The 
transfer dated 17th December 2007 made between the Mayor and Burgesses 
of the London Borough of Camden and Zdravko Jakisic, Marin Jakisic, Mari
 Jakisic and Monika Jakisic was made pursuant to Part V of the Housing 
Act 1985.'

A neighbour said: 'It was a council house and they bought 
it but had lived there as council tenants first. They have been here for
 over 10 years.'

A friend of Monika's told MailOnline she believed the model, who fled war-torn Croatia with her parents when she was 10, had met Prince Andrew through mutual friends.

While neighbours have yet to see Prince Andrew, they did see the Monika's former boyfriend, the former Egypt and Tottenham Hotspur soccer player known as Mido.

A
 neighbour said: 'She went out with Mido when he was at Spurs. All the 
boys in the streets loved it when he would turn up here in his flashy 
cars.

'She's definitely had some rich boyfriends -  some of her visitors have come round in Bentleys and Lamborghinis - but we’ve never seen Prince Andrew though.

'Monika's 
dad has a bad back so he doesn’t work - and her brother is a lovely guy, I think he's a model too. I think that her mother is a cleaner, she goes out to work at 5am.

'You see Monika walking around in her trackies, no make-up on – it’s great she’s so down to earth.'

While a local shopkeeper said she is a regular customer, buying Haribo sweets and chocolate cookies.

Rumours of a
 romantic relationship between the model and royal first emerged after 
they were seen together celebrating the prince’s birthday in February at 
Cecconi’s restaurant in London's Mayfair, where he was reportedly seen kissing 
her hand and cuddling up to her.

Two days later, they were again 
seen together enjoying an intimate dinner at private members’ club The 
Arts Club in London's West End.

Then earlier this month, Monika, who was dressed in skin-tight leather trousers and towering 
Louboutin heels, was seen giving Prince Andrew a tender kiss on the 
cheek outside the Royal Thames Yacht Club in Kensington, west London.

Although she had arrived separately from Andrew at around 8pm, they
 were seen emerging from the club together three hours later.

As
 they descended the steps, Andrew held his arm around Miss Jakisic who 
in turn placed her hand on his shoulder. He then watched her leave 
alone.

After their string of supper dates, Andrew was forced to issue a denial they were engaged after Monika sted a 
photograph on Twitter of what appeared to be a diamond engagement ring 
on top of a £600 restaurant bill.

The picture prompted a flurry of 
calls to Buckingham Palace – forcing Andrew’s representatives to issue 
the embarrassing and unprecedented statement.

A 
spokesman for the prince who had hitherto declined to comment on 
speculation about the nature of their relationship, said: ‘I can confirm
 the Duke of York is not engaged to Monika Jakisic.’

It later emerged that the picture she posted
 on social networking site Twitter of the engagement ring and restaurant
 bill was a congratulations message to two friends.

Monika's modelling career took off after she entered a competition run by Storm, the agency which represents Kate Moss. Standing 5ft10 tall, she now refers to herself as the ‘Croatian sensation'.

On
 Twitter, she has posted photos of herself in bikinis, and says she is 
‘spiritual humanitarian’ with a ‘wild sense of humour’ who loves to stay
 fit by boxing.

She has also posted several ‘selfies’ 
taken with celebrities including rapper P Diddy and on the red carpet at
 the recent BAFTA awards in London.

There is no mention of Prince 
Andrew but a post on Twitter on February, just days after the alleged 
birthday date, reads cryptically: ‘Everything Is Possible☺#mylife’  and,
 separately, a picture of a Valentine’s Day bouquet.

Once named by Esquire magazine as one
 of the ‘sexiest women alive’, a recent article about her said: 
‘Monika’s jet set lifestyle and effervescent personality has made her 
regular on the international glitterati party circuit and consort of 
choice to many of Hollywood’s top stars.’

Indeed she 
enjoyed an ‘on-off’ relationship with Hollywood A-lister George Clooney 
since 2004, even being described as his ‘secret girlfriend’. Clooney is now dating British barrister Amal Alamuddin.

A friend of the prince’s 
denied any romance between Andrew and Monika, adding she ‘only 
joined Andrew and a group of friends at the end of the evening’.

A senior royal aide also attempted to quash the speculation, saying: ‘They are friends.

He has known her for a number of years – over a decade – and to say that they are more than friends would be incorrect.’

Since his divorce from Sarah, Duchess 
of York, mother of his two children Princess Beatrice and Princess 
Eugenie, Andrew has been linked with a series of women.

He
 was said to have come close to settling down with millionaire 
businesswoman Amanda Staveley, romanced US supermodel Angie Everhart and
 been linked with mysterious Kazakh businesswoman Goga Ashkenazi.

He still, however, shares his home, Royal Lodge, in the shadow of Windsor Castle, with his ex-wife, Sarah.

The
 pair are remain close friends and say they continue to live together 
into to be ‘the best co-parents possible’ to their daughters.'
