If a Premier League return wasn't enough for Mario Balotelli to keep viewers interested, Liverpool's frontman has now showed off his striking new hairdo.

The Reds signed Balotelli from AC Milan for £16million in the summer, with Brendan Rodgers eager for the Italian to keep his head down and build on his solitary goal against Ludogorets.

And while Rodgers may insist the 24-year-old isn't complicated, the new design must have had his hairdresser perplexed. There have been some suggestions that the tattoo is based on Liverpool's badge, although it does seem coincidental.
