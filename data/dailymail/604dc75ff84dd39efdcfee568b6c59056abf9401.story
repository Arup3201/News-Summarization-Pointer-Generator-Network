Liverpool and Chelsea played out an enthralling 1-1 draw at Anfield on Tuesday - but not before Raheem Sterling and John Terry became better acquainted with one another.

Reds forward Sterling was blocked by Terry but ended up running straight into the Blues centre back - with the force of the collision forcing him to roll over and become entangled.

Unfortunately for Terry, he landed on his shoulders his head became lodged between Sterling's legs - while his own limbs wrapped around the Liverpool attacker, who appealed passionately for a free-kick.

This was one unusual incident on a night in which Sterling excelled - the England international scored a magical solo equaliser during the 1-1 draw.

Eden Hazard had put the visitors ahead from the penalty spot in the first half after Emre Can had clattered into the Belgian in the box.

But Sterling ensured Liverpool earned a draw in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday night.

The sides will meet for the return encounter at Stamford Bridge next week.
