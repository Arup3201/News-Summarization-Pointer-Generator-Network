Struggling heat-stricken koalas with burnt paws are in desperate need for mittens followed by the devastating bushfires in South Australia and Victoria.

The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) has launched a public appeal in a bid to get cotton-made mittens from knitters to help treat injured koalas.

The injured marsupials typically come into care with severe burns, especially on their paws, caused by contact with burning trees or from fleeing across fire grounds.

It comes as South Australia endured the state's worst fire conditions since the Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday, destroying more than 30 homes and leaving 134 people injured.

Calling all knitters! An animal care group has launched a public appeal for mittens to be made to help koalas

When koalas come into care, they get treatment with burns cream and their paws would be covered with bandages before being protected with the special cotton mittens.

'We don't know how many mittens we need but once the grounds are reopened to the wildlife rescuers, they will begin their black walk,' an IFAW spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

'We just don't know the extended injuries but we want to have the mittens ready to go and fit over their paws when they come into care to help protect their wounds.

'The treatment for koala burns is quite similar to treating human burns and koalas are very passive animals so they don't react like cats or dogs.'

IFAW native wildlife campaigner Josey Sharrad said a plentiful supply of these mittens is needed throughout the bushfire season. 

'Just like any burns victim - koalas' dressings need changing daily, meaning a constant supply of mittens is needed by wildlife carers. Some burned koalas can take up to a year to fully recover,' she said.

Firefighters and residents  have also provided water to thirsty and severely burnt marsupials since the extreme blaze took place last week.

A young koala is in recovery after suffering second-degree partial thickness burns on all his four paws from the raging bushfires in South Australia

Heartbreaking images of Jeremy the koala have gone viral since he was treated at Australian Marine, Wildlife Research and Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) on Tuesday

On Tuesday, Jeremy the koala suffered second-degree partial thickness burns on all four of his paws from the raging blaze as he tried to escape the fires.

Now, the organisation is seeking mittens from the public - they can be made from scraps of clean and 100 percent cotton fabric. 

'Maybe you have some old cotton sheets or tea towels – just check that the material is 100% cotton,' Sharrad said.

'These mittens are simple to make even if you've never sewn before. Just check out IFAW's koala mitten pattern.' 

Send your mittens to: IFAW, 6 Belmore Street, Surry Hills 2010 NSW Australia

The team will distribute them where they are most needed: to the vets, vet nurses and wildlife carers who help the native wildlife in times of crisis.
