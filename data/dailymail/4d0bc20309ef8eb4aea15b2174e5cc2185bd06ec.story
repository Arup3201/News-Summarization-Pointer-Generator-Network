Ministers tried to justify the alleged rendition and torture of a key Libyan politician by portraying him as a terrorist linked to Al Qaeda, it was claimed last night.

The Government is said to have made the allegation as part of its defence in a torture case brought by Abdel Hakim Belhadj, the military leader who liberated Tripoli from Colonel Gaddafi 18 months ago. The damaging claim comes just days after Prime  Minister David Cameron paid a surprise visit to the Libyan capital in an attempt to shore up relations between the UK and Libya.

In the legal documents, seen by  The Mail on Sunday, the Government calls Mr Belhadj the ‘emir’ or global leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), which it says is a  terrorist organisation.

Abdul Hakem Belhaj, the commander of the rebel forces in Tripoli, Libya, insists he has no links to Al Qaeda and is suing the UK Government for authorising his torture

Mr Belhadj is bringing a multi- million-pound claim against the Government over his rendition when he was arrested in Thailand and handed over to Gaddafi in 2004.

In the documents, Ministers appear to justify the alleged torture of  Mr Belhadj and his then pregnant wife, who claim they were abducted, chained, hooded and beaten.

The Government alleges: ‘In the mid-1990s, the group claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks in Libya.’ It adds: ‘At all  material times MI6 assessed that  elements of the LIFG supported and had links with Al Qaeda.’

Last night, Mr Belhadj rejected the claims and accused the Government of wasting taxpayers’ money on blackening his name. His lawyer, Sapna Malik, said: ‘Mr Belhadj has always denied that he was aligned to Al Qaeda and maintains that the focus of the LIFG under his command was  the removal of Gaddafi.’

She added: ‘Whatever someone’s alleged conduct, this does not make their torture lawful or allow those complicit in their torture off the hook. It would be alarming if the Government were to suggest otherwise.’

The court documents show that the Government, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and former MI6 head of counter-terrorism Sir Mark Allen, want Mr Belhadj’s case struck out because his claims are covered by the Official Secrets Act. They all deny  the torture and rendition allegations.

The papers also reveal that Mr Straw and the Coalition are prepared to make more claims against Mr Belhadj as the case progresses to trial. Mr Belhadj says British intelligence officers also provided Libyan interrogators with questions to ask their captives and flew to Tripoli to interview the detainees in jail. He also says MI6 alerted Libyan intelligence to his and his  family’s whereabouts.

Colonel Gaddafi was killed in 2011. Mr Belhadj, who played a key role in his assassination, insists he is not a terrorist

He also refers to a letter from Sir Mark to Gaddafi’s then head of security, Moussa Koussa, which said: ‘I congratulate you on the safe arrival of [Belhadj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya. I know I did not pay for the air cargo [but] the intelligence [on him] was British.’

Cori Crider, from the human rights charity Reprieve, said: ‘The public interest now lies in getting to the full truth about this sordid episode.’

l An Afghan spy who fled to the UK after being exposed as a secret agent working for the CIA is to be sent back to Afghanistan, where he says he faces execution by the Taliban.

The 36-year-old male, who can be identified only as MS, left Afghanistan after his cover was blown in an Afghan newspaper, and his brother, also an agent, was murdered by the Taliban.

The UK Government claim he is no longer a ‘priority’ for Taliban death squads. Last week, the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office, paving the way for his deportation within weeks.
