The man who completed the world’s most difficult climb this week, came up with the idea for the feat to move on from the ‘deep pain’ of divorcing his first wife.

Dailymail.com can reveal that Tommy Caldwell decided to scale the 3,000ft El Capitan in Yosemite National Park to ‘escape’ from the agony of splitting with Beth Rodden, a fellow climber and his teenage sweetheart.

Caldwell did not think he could do it but after meeting the woman who would become his second wife he fell in love again and decided that it ‘just might be possible.'

This week, eight years after he initially had the idea, Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson became the first people ever to climb El Capitan’s Dawn Wall using just their hands and feet.

The pair endured split fingertips, holes in their hands and had the skin ripped off their digits so many times they had to get up every four hours in the night to apply balm.

In interviews afterwards Caldwell, 36, said that he wanted to ‘explore the limits of what was possible’ and that it drove him for several years.

But in reality the driving force was the pain of breaking up with his teenage sweetheart, according to his second wife, photographer Rebecca Pietsch, 29.

On their shared blog she wrote: ‘I can't even begin to understand and explain what has all led up to this moment.

‘The Dawn Wall started out as a little bit of an escape from a deep pain Tommy felt from the sadness of splitting up with his former wife.

‘He deemed the wall impossible to free climb.

‘He came back to it a year later, and with the excitement of a budding relationship between us decided that The Dawn Wall just might be possible.

‘Our relationship began with this route, and The Dawn Wall has weaved its way through our lives together over the past 6 years.’

Caldwell and Rodden, 34, were seen as the perfect All-American climbing couple while they were together.

They met at a junior climbing competition in 1995 when they were in their teens and their careers were only just beginning.

Their lives revolved around climbing 24 hours a day and they once spent Valentine’s Day scaling Meltdown, an extremely difficult 70-foot crack at Upper Cascade Falls in Yosemite.

Another time they spent 18 days rafting along the Grand Canyon in search of climbable rocks.

They even had their own website, bethandtommy.com, but it is now inactive.

In 2000, while he was attempting to scale a sheer face in the Pamir mountains in Kyrgyzstan with Beth and three other climbers, four terrorists from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a group linked to Al Qaeda, began spraying them with bullets.

Fearing that they were just seconds from being killed, they abseiled down to the ground.

Six days of hell followed as the gunmen moved them from place to place, with little food or water.

That ordeal also helped inspire to to accomplish the recent feat.

Caldwell and Rodden got married in 2003 by which time she had become the second woman to make a free ascent of El Capitan.

She was also part of the first all-female ascent of Madagascar's Tsaranoro Massif in 1999 and soon became established as one of the world’s most successful female climbers.

Around the time she and Caldwell split, she suffered debilitating injuries to her shoulder and finger while bouldering in Yosemite. It put her out of climbing for a year and forced her to refocus her life.

In an interview with climbing blog Crux Crush she later said: ‘After going through a divorce and almost 4 solid years of injuries during that time, I’ve come to appreciate just being able to go climbing at all.

‘Not being able to use climbing as an outlet and escape was quite difficult and in the end made me appreciate going climbing in any capacity so much more.’

In the same piece she described Caldwell as ‘by far the most influential person in my climbing, hands down’.

Caldwell, 36, from Estes Park, Colorado, had started climbing at three and became a national climbing champion at 16.

He accidentally sawed off his left index finger and when doctors reattached it and told him he could never climb again, he asked that they remove it once more so he could go back to what he loved doing.

National Geographic recently called Caldwell ‘arguably the best all-around rock climber on the planet’.

In 2000 while on a trip to Kyrgyzstan's Kara Su Valley Caldwell, Rodden and the group they were with were kidnapped by Islamic militants who held them hostage for six nights.

They escaped when Caldwell shoved their guard off a ledge to his death and they climbed 18 miles to freedom.

Rodden is now remarried to Randy Puro, 42, also a climber, and lives in Yosemite National Park and Berkeley, California.

Last July they had a son, Theo, and Rodden wrote on her blog how she climbed right up until she gave birth.

She wrote: ‘If there’s anything I’ve learned over the last year, it’s that all forms are always changing, evolving and growing.

‘It’s the nature of life. Instead of fighting this reality, it’s much better to accept it, even appreciate it. I try to remind myself of this, but it's hard, I can be quite stubborn.’ 

Caldwell and Pietsch have a son, Fitz, two, and on his Facebook page writes how he is happier than ever.

Last July next to a picture of his wife and baby he wrote: ‘4 years ago today my life was forever changed in the best way possible. Thanks for making every moment feel like magic.’

In one interview he added that his son’s birth ‘has made me much more responsible and intentional because I want to set a good example’.

Caldwell and Jorgeson’s ascent of the Dawn Wall, which lasted 19 days and began on December 27, is already being hailed as one of the greatest climbs ever by mankind.

The granite rock is smooth as a bedroom wall and the only ledges the men could grab were as sharp as razors and the size of a matchstick.

Then there was the sheer height of the rock: El Capitan is the height of three Empire State Buildings stacked on top one another, or 17 Nelson’s Columns.

After they reached the summit President Obama Tweeted a picture of El Capitan with the caption that he was ‘so proud’ of the two men as they ‘remind us that anything is possible’.

A woman who answered the phone at Rodden’s home in Yosemite National Park told DailyMail.com: ‘Maybe you could try back in a bit,' and hung up.
