Actress Gwyneth Paltrow is famed for her clean living and healthy eating. From kale to quinoa, the mother-of-two is all for foods that are nutritious and natural.

Now, along with her team at Goop, she wants to help other people convert to her low-fat living.

In the latest edition of her digital publication, the lifestyle guru has challenged people to send in their favourite recipe to see if she can make it super healthy.

Gwyneth in the kitchen: The star wants to make meals more healthy

The Goop newsletter states: 'We love to 
make food healthy - without sacrificing any of the taste. If you have a 
favourite recipe that might just go a bit too heavy on the cheese, 
cream, or butter, send it over: We'd love to take a crack at lightening 
it up a bit.'

The website already offers a number of low-fat meal ideas using healthy ingredients and promises to share their new meal makeovers based on readers' suggestions online.

The need to find healthy alternatives to favourite dishes comes as Gwyneth, 41, revealed she has had to rethink her own diet recently.

She wrote in the newsletter: 'A recent and very in-depth food sensitivity test revealed – surprise, surprise – that I'm sensitive to dairy, gluten, wheat, corn and oats, making breakfast all the more challenging.'

Clean living advocate: The actress said she has noticed a difference in her health and appearance since she ditched sugar and dairy

The actress asked physician Dr. Frank Lipman to give her some meal ideas and he shared recipes for a 'green mojito smoothie' (which is alcohol free of course), a veggie omelette and a chai seed pudding.

As well as encouraging people to ditch fat, Gwyneth is an advocate of sugar-free diets.  

In the introduction of her recipe book It's All Good, published in 2012, she revealed how a doctor advised her to avoid sugar, dairy and processed foods because they were making her stressed out and ill. She said she noticed a transformation in her mood and energy levels after detoxing and switching to her superfood-rich diet.

Having weaned herself off sugar, the latest Goop she reveals how to replace the ingredient in your diet with alternatives such as honey and stevia.

But while the Oscar-winning actress's advise on cutting back on sugar will resonate with many, other comments she has made recently have meant she's been held up as someone to ridicule rather than respect.

First there was the way she announced her split from husband Chris Martin as a 'conscious uncoupling'.

Then she compared her life in the limelight to being in a war because it is so 'dehumanising'.

And most recently, she suggested water has feelings, writing, again on Goop: 'I am fascinated by the growing science behind the energy of consciousness and its effects on matter.

'I have long had Dr. Emoto's coffee table book on how negativity changes the structure of water, how the molecules behave differently depending on the words or music being expressed around it.'
