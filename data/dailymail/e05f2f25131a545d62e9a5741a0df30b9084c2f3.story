These are the two 'despicable' thieves who robbed an elderly woman as she lay passed out at a bus stop.

The 70-year-old had collapsed as she was waiting at the shelter in Ringwood, Hampshire.

A number of onlookers rushed to help the frail pensioner who was unconscious.

Despicable: The man and the woman were caught on CCTV a short time after the incident at Ringwood bus station in Hampshire

But while they waited for an ambulance, a couple took advantage of the situation and removed her purse from her canvas shopping bag.

The theft wasn't discovered until she had recovered in hospital some time later.

By then, the pensioner's credit card had been 
used to put £50 credit on a mobile phone and there was an attempt 
to get cash at a nearby bank.

The woman has now been released from hospital but is said to have been left 'shaken' and 'very upset' by the incident - which happened on November 21.

Police have released CCTV images of a man and a blonde woman who are suspected of carrying our the 'despicable' act.

PC Tom Neale, from Hampshire Constabulary, today appealed for help in finding the couple.

He said: 'This is an opportunist and, frankly, despicable act.

'It happened at a busy bus station and a number of people came to the woman’s aid.

'Unfortunately, someone has taken advantage of the situation to steal from the unwell woman.

'They took the purse from her bag and left, not caring what happened to her.'

He added: 'I am appealing to the person or people who carried out this crime to hand themselves in.

'Or, if anyone recognises these people, please tell the police.

'I also would like to speak to those people who helped the woman. They may have information that can assist the investigation.'

The man - in his early to mid 
twenties - is of medium build and wearing a dark hooded top with an 
orange or gold motif across the front.

He wore jeans and white trainers.

The woman - of a similar age - has blonde shoulder-length hair and is of medium build.

She wore a dark jacket and carried a black and white stripped umbrella.
