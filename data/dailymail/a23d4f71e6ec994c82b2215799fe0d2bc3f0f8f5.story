Liberal Democrats have ‘rescued the country’ by helping secure the economic recovery, Treasury minister Danny Alexander boasted yesterday.

In an interview yesterday, the Treasury chief secretary was ‘p****d off’ at the Tories claiming credit for tax cuts for low-income workers and Britain’s economic recovery. 

‘The economic plan is just as much my plan as it is George Osborne’s,’ he said. ‘It is just as much a Liberal Democrat plan as it is a Conservative plan.’

Speaking at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Alexander urged activists to claim credit for the recovery.

The MP, who surprised activists by appearing at the podium without a jacket or tie, and with his sleeves rolled up, said: ‘We have rescued the country, and we need to summon up all our courage and resourcefulness to save it again, from a Labour party that would borrow too much and a Tory party that would cut too much.’

He went on: ‘We have rescued the economy, given opportunity to young people, cut taxes for millions of working people. This message needs to be told in every community, on every doorstep. Don’t be shy about it.’

Mr Alexander said Labour and the Tories were like ‘two drunks fighting over the steering wheel’, with neither able to keep the economy under control.

‘Many would say we are the heart of this administration. It’s because we are in Government that we have an economic recovery.’

Mr Alexander said the Lib Dems would demand a new ‘fiscal rule’ after the next election that would require the burden of deficit reduction to be borne by the better off.

He said the party would also invest billions more than the Tories in infrastructure. And he warned wealthy tax dodgers that the Treasury was coming after them.

‘We are using psychologists and behavioural economists in HMRC to get the money quickly,’ he said.

‘Tax dodgers beware - we know where you live, we know how much you owe, and now we know how you think. Your behaviour is unacceptable, and we are coming for our money.’
