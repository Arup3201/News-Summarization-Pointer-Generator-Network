Most people work out if they are overweight by stepping on to the bathroom scales or seeing if they can still fit into their favourite clothes.

But doctors rely on a more scientific formula, called the Body Mass Index (BMI), which involves dividing a patient’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.

For nearly 200 years this has been the gold standard by which the nation’s weight patterns have been monitored.

These days, BMI is a household term, but now many scientists are asking just how useful it really is, because it fails to accurately assess your body fat

These days, BMI is a household term. But now many scientists are asking just how useful it really is, because it fails to accurately assess your body fat.

For example, a supremely fit and muscly athlete might be classed as obese despite carrying little or no body fat, simply because muscle is more dense — i.e. heavier — than fat.

At the other end of the scale, a slim man with little muscle mass and a stomach paunch could be classed as healthy, despite the fact that he may be carrying a relatively large amount of fat around the waistline.

This is important because visceral fat, which lies in and around the abdomen, is thought to be a key risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Visceral fat secretes molecules that, among other things, lead to damaging inflammation in blood vessels.

This flaw in BMI is why even super-fit people can be told to go on extreme diets because they register as overweight or obese on the BMI chart.

Scientists are questioning the reliability of measuring fat by Body Mass Index (BMI). As a result of the flaws in this system, scientists are now turning their attention to new ways of measuring body fat. One is the A Body Shape Index (ABSI), which was developed two years ago by researchers at the City College of New York

Last month, Anita Albrecht, a professional bodybuilder and personal trainer from East London, was told she needed to lose weight after a nurse diagnosed her as overweight, based on her BMI score, during a routine visit to an NHS clinic.

Miss Albrecht, who finished sixth in the 2012 Miss Galaxy Universe bodybuilding competition, was told she needed to go on a 1,000-calorie-a-day diet — half the recommended intake for a woman. 

At 4ft 11in and weighing 10st 3lb, she was found to have a BMI of 29, officially ‘overweight’ and borderline obese. Even in his prime, rugby star Jonny Wilkinson was reportedly classed as overweight according to his BMI.

‘Where BMI is really useful is for measuring trends in large populations,’ says Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum.

‘That’s because when you look at large numbers, the big, muscly types and the thin unhealthy types tend to cancel each other out, so you can get an average over thousands of people. The big problem is with individual patients.’

As a result of the flaws in this system, scientists are now turning their attention to new ways of measuring body fat. One is the A Body Shape Index (ABSI), which was developed two years ago by researchers at the City College of New York.

It uses a similar formula to the one used for BMI, but adds in waist circumference, so takes visceral fat into account. Computer software then predicts the chances of dying from weight-related problems.

For example, a score below one means there is less chance of dying prematurely from obesity-related conditions. But a score of two predicts the patient is twice as likely to die from obesity as the average person of their age and sex.

A recent study, published in the online medical journal PLOS ONE, found this way of measuring the body was highly accurate at predicting deaths from obesity-related illnesses.

The problem is while BMI can be worked out on a calculator, the ABSI is more complicated and relies on computer software to convert the measurements into your risk of dying prematurely. Another new approach is the Body Adiposity Index (BAI), developed at the University of Southern California in 2011.

This uses a formula based on dividing your height by hip circumference to roughly calculate the body fat percentage.

If the score is less than 23, this suggests you have healthy levels of body fat. Anything between 23 and 29 is overweight and 29 or over obese.

So a man who is 5ft 9in but weighs in at 15st, with 44in hips, would have a BMI of 31 — making him only just inside the obese range. But his BAI score would be 31.2 — indicating dangerously high levels of fat around the waistline.

In other words, it’s a better insight as to how his fat levels are likely to affect his health.

Professor Richard Bergman, who developed the BAI, says it gives a good indication of fat levels whatever the patient’s weight.

But research has suggested it does tend to overestimate the amount of body fat in men and underestimate it in women due to statistical flaws.

British experts stress that neither of the new scoring systems is used in the NHS and, for most doctors examining patients on a day-to-day basis, the most important factor is their tummy size.

‘Put simply, if they have a big belly, then they have a weight problem and they need management,’ says Dr Haslam. ‘I use waist circumference as a measure because it’s manageable.’

Diabetes UK says a woman should consider herself at risk if her waist reaches 31.5in (80cm), a white or black man 37in (94cm) and South Asian men 35in (90cm).

The threshold for the South Asian population is lower because they tend to deposit visceral fat more easily.
