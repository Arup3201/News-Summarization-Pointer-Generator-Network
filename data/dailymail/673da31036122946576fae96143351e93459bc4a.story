Winking Jeremie Calo and his date were caught having sex in a restaurant in front of families enjoying meals.

Shocked parents and their children lost their appetites when a couple began having sex on a restaurant table in front of their eyes.

The amorous pair were ordered to stop by the furious boss at the Florida eaterie.

But outrageous Jeremie Calo claimed his date could not stop as 'she can't get up at this time.'

The incident came to light in a police report that claimed the 32-year-old and his partner were 'having sex on a table in view of minor children'.

That was outside on the patio of Irish themed Paddy Murphy's in Baldwin Park, Orlando.

On their website the business reveals it has 'live entertainment' every other weekend and it  encourages visitors to 'enjoy your visit.'

This was not what they had in mind.

Manager Tom Murphy insisted he tried to put a stop to the couple's fun the moment he realised what was going on.

According to police he told the couple: 'Compose yourself, pay your tab or I'll call the police.' That was when Calo claimed his friend could not 'get up.'

Passers-by told America's Local 6 news they were appalled parents and children had to endure the scenes.

Ashley Webster said: 'That's ridiculous that they would do that out in public, and also in front of kids.'

Over the road from the bar mum Jackie Kelvington watched her daughter at gymnastics.

Lucky: Manager Tom Murphy called police to the incident where Calo was arrested for fighting with the restaurateur and not paying his bill but the couple avoided being taken in for having sex in public

Yuck: Mr Murphy told the police operator that Calo was drunk and aggressive as shocked passers-by called their behaviour 'totally unacceptable and insane'

She said: 'That's totally unacceptable and insane. I'm shocked. I can't believe that.

'I would absolutely yank my kids, get them away from that situation and hope that they didn't see too much.'

Police were called to the scene where Calo was arrested for fighting with the manager and for refusing to pay his $101 bill - about £62.50.

The couple avoided arrest for the sex allegations because none of the parents wanted to make statements.
