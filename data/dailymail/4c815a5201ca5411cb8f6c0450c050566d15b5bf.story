It is a battle that will be familiar to every weary new parent.

Your back is turned for one second only for your offspring to start chewing merrily on something potentially lethal.

But it was the heart-stopping moment that Lenka Clayton discovered her baby son clutching a packet of rat poison, poised to pop it into his mouth, that she realised she could turn her anxiety into art.

Artist Lenka Clayton has turned her mischievous toddler Otto's penchant for shovelling objects into his mouth into an exhibition of the items that got away - from a cotton reel, a bulldog clip to a cigarette butt and lumps of dried chewing gum

Yt was the heart-stopping moment that Lenka Clayton discovered her baby son (pictured) clutching a packet of rat poison, poised to pop it into his mouth, that she realised she could turn her anxiety into art

Large lumps of rock, bubblegum and sweets still in their plastic wrappers and pen tops found their way into her son's grasp, saved from his mouth at the last minute by Ms Clayton's watchful eye

After she had wrestled the lethal morsels from her son's mouth, Ms Clayton decided to photograph each in turn, and it has now formed an unusual collection of photographs featuring more than 60 objects - including a cotton reel, wood, and a bulldog clip

The artist, from Cornwall, has since turned her mischievous toddler Otto's penchant for shovelling objects into his mouth into an exhibition of the items that got away - from a cotton reel, a bulldog clip to a cigarette butt.

After she had wrestled the lethal morsels from her son's mouth, Ms Clayton decided to photograph each in turn, and it has now formed an unusual collection of photographs featuring more than 60 objects.

The art work - gathered between the ages of eight to 15 months - has been entitled '63 Objects Taken From My Son's Mouth', and was created in her 'residency in motherhood'.

The art work - gathered between the ages of eight to 15 months - has been entitled '63 things from my son's mouth', and was created in her 'residency in motherhood'. Among the items is a beer bottle top, a seed husk, and a wooden toy

Ms Clayton was born in Cornwall and now lives with her family in Pittsburgh, US. 

The items have now been made into a limited edition book, available from her website. 

She told the Telegraph that they were collected  from surfaces in Cornwall, London, Paris and the U.S., as she and her husband Seth travelled around the world. 

She said the first object - rat poison - was picked up by her son in a hotel in Paris after she took her eye off him for just a second.

Her mischievous son even tried to munch on a small glass bottle with a cork top and a number of buttons and coins

The pictures are also on show at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, in Arkansas, in a piece entitled 63 Objects Taken From My Son's Mouth. They include a cigarette butt and shards of wood

She said: 'He went off and came back with something in his mouth, and looked up at me with this expectant face. It was a plastic sachet of rat poison.

'What interested me afterwards was when something so terrible and life-threatening turned into something else – a story.'

The 'moment of horror' she said then became 'something like humour', and she soon began to document the items  - including only those which scared her most.

She said: 'Now that fear has faded into the distance, we can start to delight in the collection and remember the humorous moment.'
