Hospitals should be run more like TV show Bargain Hunt to ensure the NHS gets the best value for money, a health minister said yesterday.

Conservative Dan Poulter said hospitals should take a leaf out of the book of the programme’s former host, antiques expert David Dickinson.

Dr Poulter said: ‘I’m not expecting a David Dickinson at every hospital, but if we want to cut waste in our NHS and divert more money into front line patient care, the health service needs to know a good bargain when it sees one.

‘The economic climate has meant that households across the UK are trying to make their money go further, bargain hunting is no longer just for the thrifty, but a commonplace part of modern life.’

In an attempt to save £1.5billion a year Dr Poulter will today announce plans to require hospitals to publish how much they pay for goods and services so that patients and the public can compare them.

Some NHS trusts are paying three times as much as others for prosthetic limbs, rubber gloves and syringes.

In some cases hospitals spend £56.50 for a box of 100 surgical gloves while a comparable glove is available for £34.90 per 100.

A standard 10cm x 10cm polyurethane foam dressing is available for £11.74 per pack of ten, but some trusts still prefer to purchase a brand that costs £19.87 per pack of ten, a price difference of 74 per cent per pack. And while some hospitals spend just 98p on a tube of lubricant for internal examinations, others cough up £2.77 for the same product.

Health Department sources say the NHS spends £10.5million on rubber gloves alone, a cost officials now plan to halve.

The saving would fund 844 more hip replacement operations or 6,754 cataract operations every year.

Dr Poulter, a GP himself, will announce that he is appointing a new NHS procurement champion with private sector expertise to drive down costs.

He said: ‘The Government is putting an extra £12.7billion into our NHS but that money needs to be spent much more wisely by local hospitals.

'When our NHS is the single biggest organisation in the UK, hospitals must wake up to the potential to make big savings and radically change the way they buy supplies, goods, services and how they manage their estates.

‘We must end the scandalous situation where one hospital spends hundreds of thousands more than another hospital just down the road on something as simple as rubber gloves or syringes, simply because they haven’t got the right systems in place to ensure value for money for local patients.

‘This kind of poor resource management cannot go on, and this radical new strategy will help our NHS get a grip on wasteful spending to drive real change and improved procurement practices so that more of our NHS’s resources can be spent on frontline patient care.’
