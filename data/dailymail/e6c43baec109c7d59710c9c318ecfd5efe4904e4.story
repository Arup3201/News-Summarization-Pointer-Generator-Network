The First Family continued with their holiday traditions on Friday as they welcomed the White House Christmas Tree.

The 20-foot white fir, from a Pennsylvania tree farm, arrived in a horse-drawn wagon, and was met by First Lady Michelle Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia, and the family's two dogs, Bo and Sunny.

President Obama was not able to join his ladies for the annual tradition, no doubt tied up as the administration decides who to nominate to fill the position of Secretary of Defense following the recent resignation of Chuck Hagel.

Girls day: President Obama was not able to join as the First Lady and Sasha and Malia took their new tree to the Blue Room

The day seemed to be an especially joyous one for Sasha and Malia, who turned those frowns they had on display Wednesday during the President's annual Thanksgiving pardon upside down, smiling as they walked their dogs and led the tree back to its new home in the Blue Room.

The tree will stay there this holiday season, where it will be decorated and put on display to the general public.

The annual lighting of the tree will take place on December 4.

Over it: The girls' smiles on Friday were a big departure from their scowls on Wednesday during their dad's annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon

All smiles: Also joining the ladies on Friday were the First Dogs, Bo and Sunny

As for Wednesday, President Obama's daughters seemed less than thrilled to be on hand for the annual pardoning of the Thanksgiving turkey, with Malia looking completely disinterested, and slightly horrified, when her dad asked if she wanted to pet one of the foul fowls. 

Malia took a few steps back before saying, 'Nah.' 

Having been granted amnesty from having to stand through another one of their dad's speeches on Friday however, the girls were finally showing a little bit of holiday cheer.
