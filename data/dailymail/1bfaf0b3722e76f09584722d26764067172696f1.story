The parents of missing college student Lauren Spierer voiced their anger, saying that they have been stonewalled by her friends, who may have been the last people to see the 20-year-old alive.

Speaking with Katie Couric today, Robert Spierer said: ‘I’m angry. We’ve been stonewalled, to some extent, by the last people to see Lauren.’

Lauren Spierer mysteriously vanished on June 3, 2011 after a night out with friends. She was a student at Indiana University.

Stonewalled: Lauren Spierer's parents, Robert and Charlene Spierer spoke with Katie Couric about their daughter's disappearance a year and a half ago

Demanding answers: Mrs Spierer, left, said that she must know the fate of her daughter, and if it was a random abduction or if Lauren's friends had anything to do with it

Speaking on Couric’s daytime talk show, Lauren’s parents said that their daughter’s friends are impeding the search for her. They hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence.

‘Despite their claims of doing whatever they could do, the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us…they refuse to take a police polygraph, which we feel is important for a number of reasons,’ Mr Spierer said.

The television host also asked Lauren’s still-devastated mother if, more than a year after her daughter’s disappearance, she had any theories as to who might have taken her.

‘Our biggest dilemma is not knowing if it was a random abduction or if it was someone that Lauren knew,’ Charlene Spierer told Couric.

She added that she now believes it to be someone who knew her daughter, based in part because of the lack of cooperation she and her husband have received from Lauren’s university friends.

Mr Spierer added that while he and his wife now think their daughter is dead, they still cling to hope. ‘I understand that Lauren may no longer be with us,’ he said.

‘We ache for her. We want to bring her home.’

In August, Mrs Spierer posted a heartbreaking open letter to her daughter's killer describing the intense agony of not knowing what happened to the missing Indiana University student.

'I hope you have as many sleepless nights as I have,' Charlene Spierer wrote on a family blog.

Missing: Indiana University student Lauren Spierer, 19, disappeared from Bloomington, Indiana, in June 2011. Police have few clues about her whereabouts

Missing: Charlene Spierer posted an open letter to her daughter's killer an in effort to prod him or anyone who knows about her disappearance to come forward

'I hope that some day, your parents, your siblings, your friends will all be in a courtroom when your true self is revealed, the self which was born on June 3, 2011 when you took Lauren from us.'

The search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another.

When the investigation kicked off, five of her male friends, who police believed could have offered insight into the final moments before her disappearance, have hired criminal defense lawyers and quickly stopped fully cooperating with police.

'We were shocked when several people hired attorneys within days of Lauren’s disappearance. Five young men, five attorneys.  I’m still not sure why they felt it was necessary,' she wrote.

Then, there have been multiple false leads -- possible suspects who weren't involved, remains found that didn't belong to Lauren.

The most recent lead -- the skull discovered by a fisherman in mid July in the White River -- 50 miles from where she disappeared -- could take up to eight weeks for the lab to process.

'That’s 80,640 minutes of agony.  We are waiting to find out if a skull found in the White River might be Lauren’s.  It’s chilling to say the words.  I find it incomprehensible that if by chance you are reading this, you know the answer already,' Mrs Spierer wrote to her daughter's as-yet-unidentified killer.

She also described the intense pain of knowing her daughter was dead, but having no idea what happened to her.

'For me, living without Lauren, it’s the little things in my day-to-day life which are the most difficult. The things that aren’t mentioned.  Getting mail addressed to Lauren, walking past her room just as she left it the last time she was home, still waiting for her return.

'The unpacked boxes I cannot bear to move. The notice Rob (Lauren's father) has hidden away among so many other pieces of mail, from the Department of Motor Vehicles.

'It’s Lauren’s. It arrived shortly before her 21st birthday. We try to shield each other from more pain. It is impossible to do,' she said.

Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the last known image of Lauren. Several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating

In Bloomington, a quiet college town that is known as one of the safest cities in America, the scars of Lauren's disappearance are visible even a year and a half later.

Her smiling face is visible on posters plastered on street corners, hung around the campus and posted in nearly every bar, restaurant and shop downtown.

Mrs Spierer says she is writing so that her daughter's killer, and presumably the other people who might know what happened to her, don't forget about Lauren.

'I hope I am making you uncomfortable,' she wrote.
