A walk in Goodison Park for Everton and disaster for Liverpool in Turkey. All in all, a good night for Everton in the Europa League.

The celebrations in the stands here that greeted news of Liverpool's failure in Istanbul were extraordinary. Didn't these two clubs used to be friends?

Nevertheless, as far as Roberto Martinez was concerned, the important stuff was happening on the pitch in front of him and after an early scare his team eased past their opposition from Switzerland as easily as they had in the first leg.

MOTM: Romelu Lukaku 

There was plenty of good news here for the Everton manager. Young Boys started well, took the lead through Sekou Sanogo Junior and then struck the crossbar.

Wobbly moments indeed for the home team but once Romelu Lukaku equalised from the penalty spot 10 minutes later everything changed.

The Belgian scored again five minutes later - a super goal that one - before his international team-mate Kevin Mirallas raced clear on to a Darron Gibson pass to extend the lead and make sure any hopes of a comeback from Young Boys were finally extinguished.

The opposition during this tie has been limited. The Swiss league is a poor one. Nevertheless, Everton do seem to be regaining a little confidence and if Martinez takes anything from Thursday night apart from an expected victory, it will be that.

Lukaku was terrific until he was replaced early in the second period after feeling a twinge in his thigh. Mirallas, too, had a good night and could have scored again after half-time while young full-back Luke Garbutt impressed on the left hand side.

All Martinez has to do now is make sure his team take some of this form in to the Barclays Premier League. This weekend they face Arsenal.

'I am very pleased,' said Martinez. 'The climate around the club will be good now. The domestic competition is vital to us and we know what we have to put right.'

Everton began firmly on the front foot, with Lukaku causing some trouble down the right. However as soon as the Swiss team got a foothold in the game they scored. A corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty area and when Raphael Nuzzolo's shot was headed goal wards by Milan Volotic, Tim Howard did well to save.

The Everton goalkeeper - not in the best of form of late - could only push the ball in to Sanogo Junior's path, though, and he prodded the ball in to the goal from six yards.

With such a healthy advantage in the tie, Everton should not have panicked. But they did and when Scott Sutter headed the next corner against the Everton bar the home team looked to be in all kinds of trouble.

Another goal at that early stage and who knows what would have happened a team so low on confidence. However, minutes later Everton got the break they needed when they won a penalty. It was the decisive moment of the night.

Lukaku's role in the whole affair was crucial as first he played a cute ball through to Steven Naismith and, when the goalkeeper brought the Scot down, the big Belgian beat Marco Wolfli low to his right. 

In an instant Everton went from looking rather shaky indeed to scoring a second goal that not only extended their aggregate lead but showcased the type of football they can play under Martinez.

A combination between Gibson and Luke Garbutt down the left allowed the 21-year-old to cross and the volley applied by Lukaku from 12 yards was exquisite. By the time news of Liverpool's demise filtered though, Young Boys had all but rolled over.

Mirallas could have scored when clear down the right only for the goalkeeper to save his shot down to his right. Soon after, though, he did score, running on to a Gibson through ball to beat the goalkeeper underneath his body.

Mirallas was denied again by the keeper early in the second period while, with 15 minutes left, Lukaku's replacement Arouna Kone struck the post from the edge of the penalty area.

Late on Everton had a goal disallowed as Leon Osman was penalised for a push. By that time Everton were perhaps more occupied by who they would be playing in the next round. Remarkably, they are the only British club left.
