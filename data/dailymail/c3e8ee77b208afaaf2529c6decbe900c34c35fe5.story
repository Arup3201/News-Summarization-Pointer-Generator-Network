A single mother-of-four rejected by American Idol three times is now set to land a record deal after a DIY music video she made hit the web and went viral.

Kimberly Henderson, 26, from Sunter, South Carolina, filmed herself singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida, last December.

The clip - which has since been viewed more than 2.6 million times - landed the full-time nurse an opportunity to record her own track and since then her phone has apparently been ringing off the hook.

Henderson told Fox News that she is being courted by four different record companies and she is working with a manager to negotiate a deal.

She says she has been singing since the age of two and doing it full-time would be a dream come true.

Currently Henderson - who has four children aged one to ten - works two jobs as a healthcare worker and receives help from relatives with child care.

She says she barely gets time to stop but recently she took time out to go and record her own high-gloss music track in Los Angeles called Tiny Hearts.

The beautiful ballad, which she penned in just 24 hours, focuses on her her experiences as a single parent.

The first verse describes her earliest months as a young mother to her baby girl.

'My friends are doing normal things like going to the movies and on dates and out on the weekends. And I’m at home,' she explains. 

'I felt like I was missing out on something, but coming home to her and being with her gave my life more meaning.' 

The music-making trip of a lifetime was paid for by Cosco Kids, a company which makes baby products. 

Apparently the firm found out Henderson was in a bad car crash and a Cosco car seat saved her child’s life. Managers from the business then came up with a way to support her musical endeavors.

Tiny Hearts was released in January and it jumped to number 53 in the charts.

An accompanying music video captured Henderson in action with her children and singing at a recording studio.

Candid footage also showed her getting a makeover with a stylist and make-up artist injecting some added star appeal.

Henderson says getting rejected from American Idol will not stop her from doing what she loves.

She concluded: 'They have good things to say. They just said, "You have a really unique voice, we think you’re good, but it’s just not your time yet."

'So I’m guessing maybe now it’s my time.'

On a more personal level, Henderson hopes that fame might help her to reconnect her with her own mother, who disappeared from her life when she was 11 years old.

'I don't know where she is,' the singer told The Huffington Post, adding, 'But I keep thinking that maybe if she somehow sees my video or my new song, she'll come forward and try to reach out.' 

Henderson says her family are excited about her recent breakthrough. 

Along with Whitney Houston and Sam Smith, Christina Aguilera is another of the blonde's musical idols.
