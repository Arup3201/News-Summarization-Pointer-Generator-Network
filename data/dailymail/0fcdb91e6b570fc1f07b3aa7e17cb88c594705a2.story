14 skydivers have been ripped out of the sky by wild winds, with two victims rushed to hospital and 12 others treated by paramedics after the terrifying crash landings.

After a 38-degree sunny day, a fierce storm quickly took hold with the skydivers suddenly facing an intense hail storm and violent winds.

Horrified members of the public looked to the sky as skydivers fell at a rapid pace, battered onto St Kilda beach in Melbourne.

The skydivers fell through the sky with force, with two crashing into the ocean and another 12 landing across the beach and pier, spread over a wide area.

Senior Paramedic Team Manager, Jo Wilton, said that it was a chaotic scene when they arrived.

During the free fall many were blown across the sky like rag dolls, lucky to escape with only minor injuries.

The first two survivors were found on St Kilda Pier just after 3pm and were treated by Metropolitan Fire Brigade marine firefighters

Two of the survivors were taken to hospital with injuries sustained from their fall, as well as from the hail that battered them during their descent

‘They were all incredibly lucky. Witnesses say they hit the water or the ground really hard so it could have been a lot worse than what it was,’ Senior Paramedic Team Manager Jo Wilton said.

It’s understood that two people were sent to Albert Hospital, whilst others were treated at the scene, administered with pain relief and treated for welts and soreness, primarily caused by the hail storm.

‘It would have been very frightening for those involved, but they were well cared for at the scene and kept calm.’
