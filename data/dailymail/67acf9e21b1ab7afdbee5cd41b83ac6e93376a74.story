A heritage-listed home with a 150-year history is set to break property records at Sydney's Potts Point with an estimated price tag of $20 million.

The 1,970-square-metre home at Potts Point not only boasts a rich past but six bedrooms, five bathrooms and six parking spaces.

Advertised as a 'regency revival family estate', Jenner House was home to the brother of department store owner Anthony Horden, Lebbeus Hordern, and was built around 1868 by distinguished architect Edmund Blacket.

The Potts Point home on Macleay Street is estimated to sell for about $20 million

The three-storey house was initially built as two storeys circa 1868 and was one of the late 19th century villas lining Potts Point

After Mr Horden, one of New South Wales' wealthiest men - John Thomas Nealk - who made his fortune as a clothes dealer took up residence in about 1875 and died at the address in 1897.

It was also once occupied by King George V during his time in the Royal Navy.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported the house currently holds the Potts Point record of highest selling residence of $15 million, which was set when it was sold to high-profile car dealer Terry Mullens and wife Wendy by horse trainer Tony Peterson in 2009.

In Jenner House's history - which has spanned almost 150 years - it has been known as Stramshall Villa from about 1871 to 1879, Kurrahjeen from 1880 to 1885 and Lugano from 1888 to 1911. Its current name was bestowed on it in 1914.

The three-storey house sits on parklands facing north-east with panoramic views of Sydney Harbour, with a circular driveway and a 600-square-metre forecourt garden complete with its own gatehouse.

Despite its modern facilities, Jenner House - located on Macleay Street - still retains its colonial roots with 10 marble fireplaces, a grand cedar staircase, a colonnaded entrance foyer, four-metre high ceilings, cast-iron columns and lacy balconies.

It's no wonder it has a $20 million price tag with a colonnaded entrance foyer and a grand cedar staircase

Retaining its colonial roots with its 4m high ceilings, a modern edge is added with a kitchen with marble counter tops and industrial kitchen facilities

This is married with a kitchen that could satisfy any keen cook's needs. The house's massive breakfast room leads into an open-plan commercial kitchen which includes a marble island, stainless steel benchtops, a gas stove and double even, a teppanyaki grill and three sinks.

Large dinner parties will be no trouble with a sizable entertainment garden and a banquet-sized dining room with a balcony and butler's pantry.

Each bedroom is decked out with luxurious marble ensuite bathrooms with heated floors and walk-in wardrobes.

The home's lavish style continues onto the last level with a basement workshop encased in sandstone walls and extensive cellars.

According to Australia's Department of Environment, Jenner House was initially built as a two-storey building as one of the late 19th century villas that lined Potts Point and was heritage-listed in 1991.Â 

The home's third-storey extensions were commissioned by Mr Nealk and done by well-known architect Thomas Rowe between 1875-1877.

Jenner House is being sold through Jason Boon of Richardson & Wrench, Michael Pallier of Sydney Sotheby's International Realty, and Barry Goldman and Robert Page of Raine & Horne Double Bay.
