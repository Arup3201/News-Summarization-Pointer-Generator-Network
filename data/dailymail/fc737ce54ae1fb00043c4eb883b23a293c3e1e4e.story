Australia's capital state could have its very own landmark Hollywood-style sign.

The idea to erect a sign spelling out CANBERRA was put forward by American-born Alicia Doherty who hopes her vision will soon become a reality.

The campaign, driven by Ms Doherty who is now a proud Canberrian, could be Canberra's answer to removing itself from the Bush Capital stigma.

A Hollywood-style sign may potentially be constructed in Canberra to remove itself from the Bush Capital stigma

'When I was living in Toowoomba I told people I was moving to Canberra and a lot of people were saying "oh you poor thing, Canberra's so boring!" but we love it,' Ms Doherty told Daily Mail Australia.

'If Canberra bores you, it's because you're a boring person. There's too much to do. Canberra has an eclectic side with really interesting people.'

The founding team member of Events NSW - who are behind Vivid Sydney, Crave Sydney International Food Festival, Breakfast on the Bridge - simply wants her hometown Canberra to have its very own iconic monument.

'It's not that I'm American and want to copy Hollywood,' she said.

'The Hollywood sign is big, memorable, people engage with it, it's really develops a life of its own, it was originally put up to promote that there was land for sale.

'People didn't like the Hollywood sign at first, but people have embraced it.

'But this site doesn't have anything to do with Hollywood other than that it's on the side of hill, it's great for tourism and promotional for Canberra, such a great image, so many great images could come from a Canberra sign on the hill.'

However the potential site, a quarry owned by Canberra businessman Lorenzo 'Laurie' Pastrello, is technically in NSW.

'It's a prime location for welcoming people to Canberra,' Ms Doherty said.

Alicia Doherty, who's driving the campaign, says the Canberra sign should be big and memorable like the Hollywood sign

'For many years now Canberra tourism has promoted gourmet food trails and wine districts that are on the outskirts of town, it doesn’t really matter, tourism has embraced its regional areas.'

She first spoke to the owner about her idea back in February 2011 as she believes the land has a lot of potential.

'It's a great opportunity to put something there that a lot of people can see,' Ms Doherty said.

'You'd be able to see the sign flying in and out. We'd be able to project images onto it and so many community groups could use it, sporting groups could light it up in their colours, Indigenous images could be projected on it and we can light it up pink for breast cancer.'

But the idea hasn't come without criticism.

'There's been a lot very positive reactions because they get that it's not just to put a sign up but to create a landmark,' Ms Doherty said.

'Others think it's tacky, why are we copying another idea? But everything's copied these days, nothing's new, it's about taking something and making it their own.

Ms Doherty hopes the community will jump on board the development process, which will source its funding from donations.

'I want the sign to be driven by the community and I'm looking into crowd funding,' she said.

She said a competition could be run for the design of the sign, where university students can also submit their proposals.

'I hope people will look forward to seeing it – like the changing Google icon. The sunsets are beautiful, the quarry looks so different at different times of the day, images are endless. If we put up installations and artworks, it could really develop a life of its own.'
