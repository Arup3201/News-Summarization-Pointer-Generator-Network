A Texas woman who lost all four limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria has been approved for a double arm transplant at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital in what will be the first such procedure performed in the United States.

Katy Hayes, 44, of Kingwood, will receive two new arms above the elbow and the former massage therapist said what she is most looking forward to is wearing her wedding ring again.

Approved by the pioneering hospital for the transplant after undergoing a rigorous evaluation, the mother of three has battled through two years of rehabilitation as a result of losing all her limbs after giving birth to her third child in 2010.

Katy Hayes spoke yesterday of her delight at being accepted by Brigham and Women's Hospital for a double arm transplant

'I want my life back,' said Hayes to reporters at a press conference yesterday.

'I want to hold my children, I want to hug my husband, I want to cook dinner.'

Hayes lost her arms and legs to a Group A Streptococcal infection that accelerated into flesh eating bacteria four days after giving birth to her third child.

The former runner and yoga enthusiast had her arms amputated above the elbow, her legs above the knees and also lost her uterus and her large intestines as doctors battled to keep her alive.

'I never thought about how much a gift your hands are,' said Hayes yesterday at the press conference. 

'When you don't have hands, you can't wear rings.'

After raising $200,000 to cover living expenses, Hayes and her family moved from Texas in July to prepare for the surgery.

'She knew from day one she wanted arm transplants, not just prosthetics,' her brother-in-law Tom Phelps said to the Boston Herald.

'I’m just shocked and amazed that science has come this far.

'Katy is just a wonderful and fabulous person, and the tragedy of her getting the strep and how it ravaged her body was just a nightmare, but she’s so strong, she just pulled through.

'I’ll never forget when she woke up from the coma,' he recalled. 'She was like, ‘OK, let’s get to work,’ and we were all saying, ‘No, you need some down time.’

Over the past two months Hayes has been undergoing psychological and physical screening at the hospital to determine her eligibility for the grueling surgery and long recovery.

The transplant could give Hayes the ability to flex and extend her elbows and to lift herself out of a wheelchair.

The level of function she will acquire, especially in her new hands, is uncertain, said Bohdan Pomahac, director of plastic surgery transplantation at the Brigham.

All the previous above-the-elbow arm transplants similar to the procedure being planned for Hayes have been performed in Munich, Germany, by Dr. Christoph Hoehnke.

When the operation is carried out a team of 40 doctors will be involved said Dr. Pomhac.

The double transplant will connect skin, muscle, bone and blood vessels in both arms.

However, while doctors and experts do not doubt the ability of the surgical team at Brigham and Women's to attach arms onto Hayes, some are unsure whether full function will be restored.

This is due to the fact that unlike internal organ transplants, hand and arm transplants are dependent on nerve regrowth to function normally said Dr. Vijay Gorantla, the administrative medical director of the Pittsburgh Reconstructive Transplant Program at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Nerves regrow at the speed of around one millimeter a day said Gorantla, who has been involved in previous Brigham and Women's surgical procedures.

'The recipient nerves have to regrow in the donor shell,' said Gorantla to ABC News.

'At this point, there's no technology to expedite that growth.

'Theoretically, there's a risk that these patients may not be functional or as functional as a distal hand transplant.'

However, yesterday Hayes paid tribute to the medical team at Brigham and Women's as she prepares to enter the next phase of quest to regain arms.

'These doctors are true rock stars. They’re giving so much hope to people, especially veterans, who are coming home with missing limbs,' she said.

In May Hayes said the operation had given her renewed hope two years after doctors were forced to carry out the quadruple amputation to save her life.

'Before I was kind of dependent, laying there, not seeing really the kind of light at the end of the tunnel,' Hayes told WFAA.

'And now I've got that light, and I'm just charging ahead. Because it's within my reach. It's going to happen.'

Hayes touched the heart of the nation in 2010 when it was revealed she had contracted a flesh eating bacteria while giving birth to daughter Arielle.

Surgeons in Houston, Texas, had no choice but to amputate her arms and legs to save her life.

After returning home Hayes, a massage therapist, struggled to come to terms with the loss of her limbs.

She was fitted with prosthetic arms allowing her to hold her baby daughter for the first time.

Hayes learned to cope with her new life with the help of her two other children, 18 year old daughter Amber and eight year old son, Jake.

child, a baby girl, that Mrs Hayes woke to find her husband had made the

The mother of three told WFAA TV that she was looking forward to the simple things with the arm transplant.

'Brushing my teeth; washing my face; wiping my own butt,' Hayes said. 'You know — things that everyone takes for granted.'

Her husband, Al, said he is also dreaming of the smaller things.

'I think about things like feeling her arms around me, or feeling her touch my hair,' he said. 'I'm looking forward to her rediscovering the joy in simple touch.'

Fund raising: The Hayes family and friend raised $200,000 to cover the 
living expenses and other costs needed for the transplant

to being able to hold and touch her family once again

Katy is a candidate for the double transplant as surgeons in Dallas left behind a significant amount of muscles and tendons when they carried out their operation two years ago.

Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, director of plastic surgery transplantation at Brigham and Women's Hospital has previously worked on the total face transplants for patients Dallas Weins and Charla Nash.

Dallas Wiens, a 26-year-old construction worker from Texas, suffered horrific facial injuries when he was burned by a live cable.

And Charla Nash was brutally mauled by a friends chimpanzee after it suffered a psychotic reaction to the prescription medication its owner had given it.

Brigham and Women’s is working with the New England Organ Bank, a New 
England-based organ procurement organization, to find Hayes a donor.
