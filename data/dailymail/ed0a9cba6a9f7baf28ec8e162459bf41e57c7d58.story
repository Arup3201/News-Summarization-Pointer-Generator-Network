A Mexican robber has admitted murdering a U.S. Border patrol agent whose death revealed a failed federal gun smuggling operation.

Manuel Osorio-Arellanes pleaded guilty to killing agent Brian Terry in 2010 - the highest profiel conviction in the case which has embarrassed the federal government and prompted a series of congressional investigations.

The killer also confessed to being part of a criminal gang who crossed into the country a week earlier to rob marijuana smugglers, stashing guns and food supplies.

Terry's death exposed the 
government’s botched ‘Fast and Furious’ gun-smuggling investigation, 
during which agents lost track of more than 1,000 guns.

Two rifles bought by a smuggling ring were found at the scene of the shooting near the town of Nogales, Arizona.

Of the five men charged with the murder, two are in custody and three are fugitives. Osorio-Arellanes is the first to plead guilty, but police are yet to reveal who they believe fired the fatal shot.

Prosecutors
agreed not to seek the death penalty against Osorio-Arellanes, who 
could be sentenced to life in prison for the first-degree murder 
conviction.

Federal 
authorities have been heavily criticized for allowing suspected straw 
gun buyers to walk away from shops with weapons instead of arresting the
suspects and immediately seizing the guns throughout the operation.

The
two rifles found at the scene of the shooting were bought by a straw 
buyer for a smuggling ring suspected of purchasing guns for the brutal 
Sinaloa cartel, according to investigators.

Authorities have declined to say whether the murder weapon in Terry's death was linked to a purchase from the operation.

Terry and three other agents came under attack in a canyon north of the Arizona border city of Nogales by Osorio-Arellanes and his four other gang members, investigators said.

Osorio-Arellanes, of El Fuerte in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, was shot during the gunfight and has been in custody since the night of the shooting.

He told investigators he raised his weapon toward the agents during the shootout but didn't open fire, the FBI said.

Sentencing has been set for January before U.S. District Judge David Bury.

‘Today's plea is an important step in seeking justice on behalf of Agent Terry,’ Laura Duffy, the top federal prosecutor in San Diego whose office is prosecuting the case, said in a statement.

‘Operation Fast and Furious’ was launched in 2009 to catch trafficking kingpins, but federal agents lost track of about 1,400 of the more than 2,000 weapons - including AK-47s and other high-powered assault rifles.

Some of the guns purchased illegally with the government's knowledge were later found at crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S.

Critics have hammered federal authorities for allowing informants to walk away from Phoenix-area gun shops with weapons.

Jaime Avila, 25, has admitted in court to buying the two guns and has pleaded guilty to gun charges in a smuggling case that's separate from the prosecution into Terry's death.

Avila, who isn't charged in Terry's death, faces up to 10 years in prison when he's sentenced on Dec. 12.

Authorities have offered a $1million reward for information leading to the capture of the fugitives.

The FBI said it continues to aggressively pursue them.
