Lionel Messi has celebrated 10 years since his Barcelona debut this week with the club’s supporters optimistic the arrival of Luis Suarez and the threesome Messi will now help make up along with the former Liverpool striker and Neymar could open another illustrious chapter in his career.

‘SMN’ might not roll off the tongue like the ‘BBC’ but the prospect of Suarez, Messi and Neymar eclipsing Bale, Benzema and Cristiano has Barca fans believing that at the grand old age of 27, and with 10 years at the club already behind him, Messi can be the star of another formidable forward line.

From the moment the star signed a serviette at the age of 13 in December 2000 to confirm his arrival at the club's famed La Masia academy, the record books have been rewritten.

Messi first exploded on to the scene at Barcelona playing on the left of a front three that boasted Samuel Eto’o and the Argentine’s good friend Ronaldinho.

When Frank Rijkaard was replaced by Pep Guardiola he insisted Ronaldinho was sold and Messi was eventually moved to a more central position with Eto’o and Thierry Henry. 

That trio won the Champions League in 2009 and when Eto’o was sold Messi linked up with Spain forwards Pedro and David Villa winning the European Cup again in 2011.

There were fears that Messi’s star was burning out last season as the burden of carrying Argentina’s World Cup hopes on his shoulders in Brazil began to take their toll. 

But with the World Cup now behind him the 27-year-old looks back to his mesmerising best once again and ready to break more records.

The Neymar connection that stuttered last season has finally sparked into life and the two seem to have a telepathic understanding on the pitch with Messi so often the provider for the Brazilian.

The addition of Suarez means it’s not only a front three likely to wow spectators and fill best-goal showreels but also one that will intimidate defences. The work-rate of the Golden Shoe winner means that defences will be under constant pressure and that will bring errors and opportunities for Messi to take advantage.

The Argentine has always looked more comfortable with an aggressive, goal-hungry centre forward in the team alongside him. He thrived alongside Eto’o and when Villa replaced Eto’o he benefited from Spain’s record scorer’s presence in the team.

Messi's position on the pitch is also likely to change when Suarez finally comes into the side alongside him. Luis Enrique is aware that the team has lost its best passer of the ball in Xavi. who is no longer a regular starter. Therefore, he wants to encourage Messi to play a little deeper than in previous seasons to offer up the assists that were once Xavi’s trademark.

When the Argentine drops into midfield dragging central defenders with him Enrique wants Suarez filling the vacant space and occupying the centre-forward territory.

As well as new team-mates and the slight change to his new position on the pitch there are also new records to be broken. One in particular looms large because of the prospect that it will be achieved in, of all places, the Bernabeu. 

Legendary Athletic Bilbao striker Telmo Zarra is currently the league’s leading scorer on 251 goals. Messi is just two goals behind on 249. The Argentine might not play 90 minutes on Saturday against Eibar having only arrived back in Spain from international duty late on Wednesday afternoon.

If he does not play a full part in the game there is every chance he will not smash the record against the minnows.

That sets up the mouthwatering prospect – for Barcelona fans at least – that he will do so against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in 10 days' time. 

It would leave Madrid fans with the dilemma of whether or not to pay tribute to their most feared rival or not. They showed their class back in 2005 when to a man they stood to clap Ronaldinho after he had destroyed them in a big win for Barca on enemy territory.

If Messi can break the record and earn the applause of the Bernabeu in the process he will really have shown once again how there is nothing he is not capable of, even after a decade in the famous red and blue shirt.
