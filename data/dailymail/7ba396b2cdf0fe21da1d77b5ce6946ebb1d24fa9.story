Manchester United beat Hull City 3-0 at Old Trafford in the Barclays Premier League.

Chris Smalling, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie got themselves among the goals, but Juan Mata topped the lot in Sportsmail's player ratings. Scroll down for more. 

MANCHESTER UNITED

David de Gea - 6.5

Had little to do but such is his current form there was no doubt he would deal with the sporadic occasion that Hull managed to get the ball in the United box.

Antonio Valencia - 6.5

Given United’s seemingly endless injury list, Valencia is turning into an important squad man for van Gaal and, against such modest opposition, looked a decent right-back.

Chris Smalling - 8

A goalscorer, thanks to some dodgy goalkeeping, but also turned in a commanding display at the back that suggests his recent nightmare at the Etihad is behind him.

Marcos Rojo - 6.5

Back from injury, his solid showing alongside Smalling was another plus point for van Gaal although far stiffer test await.

Ashley Young - 6.5

Presumably left-back is not his favoured position but against opposition like this, it scarcely mattered. Maybe the van Gaal “philosophy” is finally being picked up by his players though because Young fitted in there seemlessly.

Angel di Maria - 6

Was looking lively in the opening quarter of an hour until a hamstring injury forced him off.

Marouane Fellaini - 7

Has grown in stature over the past few weeks and no longer looks the joke signing he did a few months ago. His physicality and size at set pieces adds an important dimension to United’s play.

Michael Carrick - 7

Really steady performance, barely wasted a pass and provided a valuable barrier in front of an inexperienced and makeshift back four.

Juan Mata - 9

For a man whose future at the club has been under much debate, he certainly looked like a match winner. In the right system, and right conditions, is still world-class.

Wayne Rooney - 7

His goal was a textbook finish and vintage Rooney while his corner sent panic through the Hull defence and led to the opener.

Robin van Persie - 7

The finish was excellent, as was a diving header that was offside but still showed his scoring instincts are alive and well. The goal will have done his flagging confidence the world of good.

HULL

Allan McGregor - 5

Had two opportunities to deal with the opening goal and fluffed both; after that, it was downhill for him and his team.

James Chester - 6

Did well to put off van Persie as he looked certain to score in the first half but spent the rest of the game fighting a desperate rearguard action.

Michael Dawson - 6.5

Threw his body in the way of plenty of shots - to important effect on more than one occasion and made an incredible block to thwart Falcao - but struggled to cope with the movement and strength of Rooney.

Curtis Davies - 5

No lack of effort but couple of fundamental unforced errors, especially laying the ball off for van Persie to tee up Rooney for the killer second goal.

Andrew Robertson - 7

Forced de Gea into his first “save” of the game with a decent run and toe-poke at the United keeper after 53 minutes - that stat said more about Hull’s toothless attacking play than anything else.

Jake Livermore - 6.5

At least he looked as if he cared - which can’t be said of all his team mates - but had the thankless task of sitting in front of a back four that was under pressure for most of the 90 minutes.

Ahmed Elmohamady - 5.5

With United’s full-backs pushing high up the field, Hull’s wide midfielders were always doomed to spend the contest on the back foot and so it proved with Elmohamady.

Mohamed Diame - 5.5

United’s midfield ran riot and controlled the game with almost embarrassing ease. Surely Steve Bruce expects more from the likes of Diame.

Hatem Ben Arfa - 4

Brought off 10 minutes before the break as Steve Bruce looked to gain a foothold in the game. Ben Arfa had not looked like providing one.

Robbie Brady - 5

Hardly his fault that he made zero impact on proceedings given the fact he and Hull barely saw the ball all afternoon.

Nikica Jelavic - 6

Couple of headed half chances came his way late on in proceedings and at least he looked interested and, in the case of the second one, forced a save out of de Gea.
