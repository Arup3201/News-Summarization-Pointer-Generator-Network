George W. Bush has said that he hopes world leaders take the images he has painted of them 'in the spirit of friendship' ahead of their unveiling.

The 24 images, including Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair and the Dalai Lama, will feature in an exhibition at his presidential library in Dallas and will be revealed for the first time on the Today show on Friday.

In an interview that partly aired on the Today show on Thursday, Bush, who picked up the paintbrush when he left the White House and has since mastered images of the family pets and landscapes, spoke with his daughter Jenna Bush Hager about the leaders' reactions to his work.

'I hope
 they take it in the spirit in which these were painted in,' he said. 'That was the
 spirit of friendship and that I admire them as leaders and was willing 
to give it a shot in terms of getting people to see how I felt about 
them.'

It won't be the first time the public has seen his paintings. Last year, a hacker leaked his images of animals, landscapes and self portraits, such as him in the bath.

'I was annoyed,' Bush said. 'It's an invasion of one's privacy... nor do I want my paintings to get out.

'The truth 
of the matter is my paintings are not ready to be released. I mean, I'm 
still learning, and I don't know if they ever will be or not.'

Speaking to his daughter, who is a 
correspondent on the Today show, added that the most important thing he 
has learned so far is, 'don't paint your wife,' he said.

Work: Some of his paintings, including images of dogs and self-portraits, have previously been seen

Revealed: Some of the images, including ones of him in the shower and a bathtub, were leaked last year

Invasive: Bush said that he felt that much of his artwork wasn't ready for public viewing

Of his portrait of her, wife Laura laughed: 'Yeah, it still needs some work.'

Former first lady Laura Bush will join her husband for a portion of the interview, which will air in full on Friday, inside the art studio in their Dallas home.

The two-term president has led a significantly quieter life since leaving office - spending much of his time painting and going on mountain bike rides with groups of veterans like Wounded Warrior.

In an interview with the Dallas Morning News last year, Bush added that painting gives him an opportunity to 'create.' He also reflected on what others think of his work.

'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.'

In March last year, an artist who taught Bush how to paint both animals and landscapes in a recent month-long course spoke out his skills as a late-in-life painter.

He had spent four weeks in private lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic horizons.

'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood.

'The Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy' will be held at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas.Â 

The museum explained the exhibition 'will explore the relationships that President George W. Bush forged with world leaders to shape international policy and advance American interests abroad.'

'The exhibit will feature more than two dozen never-before-exhibited portraits painted by President Bush,' it said. 'Portraits will be accompanied by artifacts, photographs, and personal reflections to help illustrate the stories of relationships formed on the world stage.'
