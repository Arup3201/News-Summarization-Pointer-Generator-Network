The biggest box-office debut of Angelina Jolie's career propelled Disney's twisted fairy tale Maleficent, with $70 million in ticket sales, to win the North American weekend box office stakes.

The PG-rated fantasy beat forecasts to easily top all films over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.

Though Maleficent was early on considered a risky endeavor for Disney that might turn away family audiences by retelling Sleeping Beauty from the villain's perspective, the film emerged as a hit largely because of the draw of Jolie.

Top of the list: Maleficent Walt Disney's special-effects laden take on Sleeping Beauty's wicked fairy godmother, captivated moviegoers, collecting $70 million in ticket sales to win the North American weekend box office stakes

The movie starring Angelina Jolie as the black-robed villain finished far ahead of last week's winner, X-Men: Days of Future Past, which took $32.6 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters

Star power has been increasingly elusive in modern Hollywood, where name-brand concepts often rule the box-office. But Jolie, in her first live-action starring role in years, drove interest for 'Maleficent' despite lackluster reviews from critics.

'It's a unique thing,' said Dave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney. 'Her star power transcends borders and genre.'

Seth MacFarlane's Western comedy 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' was out-gunned by 'Maleficent.'

The R-rated Universal release opened in third place with a tepid $17.1 million despite a starry cast of Liam Neeson, Charlize Theron and Amanda Seyfried.

By contrast, MacFarlane's 'Ted' (for which he's making a sequel) opened with $54.4 million in 2012.

Last weekend's top film, Fox's big-budget mutant sequel 'X-Men: Days of Future Past,' dropped to second with $32.6 million. It's a somewhat steep decline for 'Days of Future Past,' but the film made $95.6 million internationally in its second week, good enough to push its global cumulative total past $500 million already.

But 
'Maleficent' dominated the marketplace, which has seen female-leading 
films continually challenge the much-disputed but still prevalent notion
 that male stars fuel the box office.

'The
 whole movie kind of rises and sets on her performance,' said Paul 
Dergarabedian, senior analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak. 'The 
concept is the character. The character is completely linked to the 
person playing that role.'

The film was a balancing act for Disney, which is used to churning out brighter tales.

Hollis credited the company's marketing department for 'walking the fine line' of selling the movie to families (which made up 45 percent of the audience, according to Disney) and suggesting an edginess that would appeal to a broader audience. 'Maleficent' earned about $100 million internationally.

'If you go to Disney, the longest lines are for the scariest rides,' Dergarabedian said. 'We're going to see more of this, where the villains are the new heroes.'

Disney has had success reimagining fairy tales in recent years with 'Alice in Wonderland' ($116 million in 2010) and 'Oz the Great and Powerful' ($79.1 million debut in 2013).

Another winner: X-Men: Days of Future Past, with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in the seventh installment based on the Marvel Comic series, has collected more than $162 million in sales

Top five: Blended, a romantic comedy pairing Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in their third film, was fifth with $8.4 million. They play single parents stuck at a resort in Africa

'Maleficent' fell short of those releases, but it was made in the same lineage. Robert Stromberg, the production designer for both earlier movies, makes his directorial debut with 'Maleficent.'

Next weekend will bring a battle between Shailene Woodley in the young adult novel adaptation 'The Fault in Our Stars' and Tom Cruise in the sci-fi thriller 'Edge of Tomorrow.' ''Edge of Tomorrow' got a jump on its North America release, taking in $20 million in 28 countries over the weekend.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be released on Monday.
