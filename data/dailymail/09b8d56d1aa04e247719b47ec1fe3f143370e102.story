Ryan Watson and his sister Emma saved their mother's life when she collapsed by calmly phoning for an ambulance and putting her in the recovery position.

Debbie, 27, who suffers from epilepsy, was battling a sickness bug when she fell unconscious and had a seizure in their home in Thornley, County Durham.

Seven-year-old Ryan called 999 and told his sister, five, to put their mother in the recovery position.

Quick-thinking Ryan, seven, and Emma, five, saved their mother Debbie's life when she collapsed and suffered an epileptic fit

Paramedics told Debbie that she would not be here if it was not for her quick-thinking kids, who were given bravery awards for their actions from the North East Ambulance Service.

The mother-of-two said: 'I'm just so proud of them, they did amazing.

'When I talk about it I shake, I just can't believe what they've done.' 

Their father Jonny, who is a first responder, had taught them to call 999 if their mother was ever unwell.

She added: 'I had a sickness bug and I couldn't keep my medication down.

'I felt quite ill but I went to pick the kids up from school.

'I managed to get into the house but then I must have had a fit and fell unconscious.

'There were only me and the kids in the house, they've never seen me like that before.

'Ryan was on the phone and he was telling Emma what to do. They already had me in the recovery position before the paramedics got here.'

Debbie was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham but has now been released.

She added: 'Jonny has always told them to call 999 if I was to ever unwell.

'They always asked 'how would we know?' and we used to say I would look like I was asleep.

'It shows they've always listened. I can't thank them enough.'

Nigel Jones, patient support clinician, said: 'I thought Ryan was fantastic, he was a little superstar. And his sister was also calm.

'Their parents should be very proud of them both.'

A North East Ambulance Service spokesperson added: 'We would like to congratulate Ryan and Emma on their quick-thinking actions, and for remaining calm when they must have been very frightened.  

'We would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our call operator Michelle Watson and patient support clinician Nigel Jones for the way they handled the call.'

The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures or fits but there are many different types, depending on the area of the brain affected. These can occur when a person is awake or asleep.

Doctors classify seizures by how much of the brain is affected. 

Partial (or focal) seizures affect a small part of the brain and generalised seizures affect most or all of the brain. Some seizures are unclassified because they fit neither category.

If you see someone having a seizure, there are some simple steps you can take to help.

If the person is suffering from convulsions, wait until they stop and then put them into the recovery position until they have recovered.

It is not usually necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure, but you should call 999 if: the seizure has not stopped after five minutes, the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between, you know it is the person's first seizure, the person is injured, has breathing problems, or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason or if the person’s behaviour after a seizure is unsafe.

A seizure that lasts longer than 30 minutes or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between is called Status epilepticus. 

This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible.

You can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy, but if you haven't had any training, it is important to call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus.
