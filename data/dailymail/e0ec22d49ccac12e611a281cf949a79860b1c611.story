A mother of seven has been found dead in a jail cell halfway through a 48-hour sentence she was serving for her children's absence from school.

Eileen DiNino, 55, was found dead at Berks County Prison in Pennsylvania, during a two day sentence that would have erased about $2000 in fines and court costs.

The debt had accumulated since 1999, and involved several of her seven children, most recently her boys at high school.

US Pennsylvanian state laws criminalise fines for truancy or those for failing to pay a rubbish bill.

District Judge Dean R. Patton, who reluctantly sent her to prison after she failed to pay the debt for four years, described her as a 'lost soul'.

'Did something happen? Was she scared to death? This lady didn't need to be there.'

Police said the cause of her death was not yet known but it was not suspicious.

DiNino's court file showed a laundry list of court fees for one case alone: $8 for a 'judicial computer project'; $60 for Berks County constables; $10 for postage.

Judge Patton said he had lost sleep over her death but also acknowledged a short jail stint can sometimes 'break the habit' of parents who'd rather party into the night than take their children to school the next day.

He said DiNino did not work or appear to have much help with four children still at home. She frequently skipped hearings, or arrived without requested documents.

'She cared about her kids, but her kids ruled the roost. She was just accepting what was coming, and (would) let the cards fall where they may.'

Although she was often unkempt, she came to court clean and neat to surrender the day before her death. She had on clean sweatpants, had combed her hair, and had tape holding her glasses together.
