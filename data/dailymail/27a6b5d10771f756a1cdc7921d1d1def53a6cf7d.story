Sympathy towards Nico Rosberg is not the prevailing sentiment in Britain at the moment, but let’s at least try to see if there is another side to the coin.

I refer to Rosberg crashing into Lewis Hamilton at last week’s Belgian Grand Prix, a crime that caused the German to be ‘disciplined’ by his Mercedes team on Friday.

In fact, I do believe Rosberg was marginally to blame for the second-lap smash. He was behind Hamilton and had a responsibility not to force the issue. But, that point conceded, Hamilton could have left Rosberg more space and still emerged ahead. Hamilton fought to win the corner, rather than the race or the championship. He eschewed pragmatism for instant glory.

So, just as his team-mate did, Rosberg resolved not to yield. They crashed. The stewards of the meeting took 10 seconds to dismiss the crash as a ‘racing incident’. Charlie Whiting, the race director, agreed that there was no case to be answered. These things happen; blame can be argued over; there are grey areas.

Certainly, no malice aforethought could be proved: Rosberg was more likely to be disadvantaged by such a crash given that a broken front wing was more probable than his sparring partner’s tyre puncturing.

Ah, but did not Rosberg admit he crashed deliberately? There is a nuance here. I took Rosberg’s alleged comment to mean he did not squirm out of the way when Hamilton, rightly, did not give way: he thought, to hell with this, I’m not going to be bullied. He did not mean that he set out with the intention of destroying his old friend’s race.

The stewards’ decision not to act should have been the end of the matter.

But, no, team boss Toto Wolff appeared on TV. I thought he was auditioning for RADA. He said he was incandescent at Rosberg’s foul play. By this point, Wolff had had the chance to speak to Hamilton, whose race had finished prematurely.

Was he stoked up by Hamilton?

The Brit certainly seems to have provoked Rosberg’s punishment – a six-figure fine – by comparing Wolff to a weak teacher. ‘It reminds me of when I was at school, the teachers will say something but they won’t do anything,’ he said.

Hamilton’s remarks were Formula One’s equivalent of waving an imaginary yellow card at the referee (except this time the two players were, partly, on the same side). To continue the football analogy, Wolff was a weak referee who had allowed a dubious goal to stand and, to atone, went straight down the other end and awarded a penalty to the opposition.

He should have brushed the whole incident off, but he did not have the authority to do so, hence Friday’s grandstanding to prove to Hamilton, the Mercedes board and the firing squad on Twitter, that he was in command of the situation and alive to all their concerns.

What was arguably worse than Rosberg’s error was Hamilton blurting out the contents of the team’s private post-race meeting. Rosberg, who places emphasis on dealing with matters internally, would never have behaved in this way.

I understand that Hamilton’s indiscretion was raised disapprovingly by Wolff and Paddy Lowe, the team’s technical boss, when they met the two drivers yesterday for peace talks. Hamilton nodded in this direction by saying afterwards in a statement: ‘Nico and I accept that we have both made mistakes and I feel it would be wrong to point fingers and say which one is worse than the other.’

That was a grown-up admission to make, and one that reinforces my belief that Rosberg does not deserve all the opprobrium.

April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second.

May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. 

May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent. Rosberg wins the race from pole. 

August 24: The two drivers collide on lap two in Belgium, with Rosberg later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash.
