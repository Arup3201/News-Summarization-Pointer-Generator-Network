Police hunting alleged cop killer Eric Frein have found two potentially lethal pipe bombs hidden deep in the woods and believe that the three-week manhunt may be taking a toll on him. 

The bombs were covered in metal nuts designed as shrapnel said Lt. Col. George Bivens of Pennsylvania State Police on Tuesday. 

'They could cause significant injury. They could be fatal,' said Bivens.

The revelation came as the hunt for 31-year-old Frein reached its 18th day with no sign of coming to an early end.

Found: The Pennsylvania State Police have discovered two pipe bombs in the Pennsylvania woods during their search for alleged cop killer Eric Frein. Both were working bombs and one was in a plastic bag

Where is he? Police have been searching for Frein for three weeks now after he shot dead a trooper and wounded another in Pennsylvania. They have revealed they have come across discarded pipe bombs

But Bivens said he is confident that Frein is getting desperate and careless, leaving behind items that he may need in a future battle with the police he has vowed to kill.

The two bombs were not deployed, Bivens said, but they were fully functional and could be set off either by a fuse or a trip wire. One of them was in a plastic bag.

'It is typical of his non-confrontational and gutless efforts to kill or injure law enforcement from a distance,' said Bivens. 'All of this indicates that we are putting significant pressure on him.'

Bivens said he believes Frein left behind some items as cops move in.

'He abandoned them because he was under pressure. It was not from his own choosing,' he said. 'He may very well be looking for a fight. He already picked the fight.'

Explosive experts in the Pennsylvania State Police are now examining the bombs.

'They have assured me they are fully functional devices,' Bevins added.

Pushing on: At a press conference on Tuesday, Lt. Col. George Bivens points to the images of the pipe bombs. He said authorities believe he discarded them in panic because he knows police are closing in on him

Authorities believe his supplies are running out and he'll soon be looking for a way to escape the woods, possibly targeting nearby cabins, homes and stores.

'He's going to have to resort to getting supplies from there,' said Bivens.

Bivens confirmed that Bryon Dickson, the 38-year-old father-of-two was was killed on September 12, had not been due to be on duty that night but swapped shifts with a colleague.

Speaking directly to Frein - who police believe has a portable radio with him - Bivens urged him to surrender.

'Eric, you are clearly stressed,' he said. 'You are making mistakes. We continue to take your supplies and weapons. Our troopers resolve is very strong and we aren't going anywhere.'

Frein is wanted for the ambush killing of Dickson, 38, who was shot late on September 12 as he left the Blooming Grove barracks at the end of his eight-hour shift.

Troopers Nicole Palmer and Alex Douglass went to Dickson's aid as he lay dying and the sniper shot again, narrowly missing Palmer and hitting Douglass, 31, in the pelvis, critically injuring him.

Bivens said Douglass is continuing to recover and should be out of hospital within days.

One source told MailOnline that police had measured the distance from the trees where the shooter lay in wait and the spot where Dickson was hit at 83 yards.

On Tuesday, the search for Frein seemed greatly scaled back a day after the focus of the manhunt shifted to an area of woods along the Brodhead Creek which runs through the picturesque Poconos village of Canadensis.

All day Monday, officers looked in an area behind the Barrett Elementary Center, a school which closed last year. FBI officers on camouflage went in and out of land around the Pasold Farms Natural Preserve.

But all they found was a married couple who had gone into the woods to get a closer look at the searchers. The couple was given a reprimand and hauled out of the search area.

By Tuesday, officers had returned to the area around Snow Hill Road, where earlier Bivens had said they had Frein contained in a five-square mile area.

Cops say Frein then made his getaway in a green 2001 Jeep but crashed it into a swamp two miles north of the barracks. They say he then made his way on foot 25 miles through dense forest back to the area close to the home he shared with his parents and teenage sister.

Over the past week they have found an AK-47 that was missing from his home along with soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarette.

Frein is known to have read survivalist literature that advises wearing a diaper to allow someone to remain in place over extended periods, leading to locals dubbing him the 'diaper sniper.'

Escape: Frein is believed to have driven this jeep to a swampy area before abandoning it after the shooting on September 12. The vehicle was later found by the Pennsylvania State Police

Determined: Frein, pictured, has managed to elude his hunters and get outside police officers' perimeters

A heavy smoker, he was obsessed with Serbia, a country he has visited at least once. He was a member of a military simulation group called Istocni Vukj - Serbian for Eastern Wolves.

Police are also understood to have recovered at least two pieces of Frein's clothing from the woods, one of which was a jacket found along with energy bar wrappers. Although Bivens would not say exactly what had been found he said a significant number' of items had been recovered.

Cops had long thought there may be pipe bombs in the woods where Frein is hiding out. He is known to have experimented at his home in the two years leading up to the shootings.

Bivens said officers have made a number of sightings of Frein dressed in dark clothing, the most recent within the past 24 hours.

He said there have been occasions when Frein has managed to elude his hunters and managed to cross roads and get outside the perimeters that up to 1,000 officers have set up.

Still looking: Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens, pictured last week, says he believes the bombs were hastily discarded, suggesting that Frein is feeling pressure from the search

'We have found a number of locations I believe he has stayed in, there has not been a bunker per se, but partially constructed shelters such as deer blinds,' he said.

The search for Frein is about to get more complicated as bow hunting for deer in the woods is set to start on Saturday. 

Pennsylvania Game Commission spokesman Travis Lau said that assuming Frein is not captured overnight, hunting would be closed in the area of the search, which is teeming with hundreds of heavily armed law enforcement officers.

Lau said the exact perimeter of the closure has not been finalized.

Hunters have already been asked to keep an eye out for cabins or other structures that look like they've been tampered with or used by Frein.

Officers have found several structures where they think the suspect has stayed, Bivens said, and police also know what Frein is eating and drinking. He would not provide specifics.

Bivens said he didn't want to be 'overly dramatic' but the danger of Frein taking a hunter hostage was a possibility.

'The idea of having hunters in the woods does cause us some concern,' he said. 'But I don't believe we have the authority to prohibit people. There is a balance that has to be struck.  

Last week, police said a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein showed he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years.

The hard drive which Frein had access to indicated extensive Internet research on topics such as 'how to avoid police manhunts, use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival,' Bivens said.

Police also were able to track Frein through his cell phone when he called his parents one time earlier this month. Frein hung up after one ring.

The FBI has added Frein to its 10 Most Wanted Fugitive List and announced a new reward for $100,000 for information leading to his capture. Crime Stoppers have also offered a $75,000 reward.
