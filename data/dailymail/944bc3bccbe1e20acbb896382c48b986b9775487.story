England’s Test series against India exploded with ill-feeling on Tuesday night when Jimmy Anderson was charged with a physical assault on Ravindra Jadeja.

The sensational claim revolves around an incident between the pair as they left the field for lunch on the second day of the first Test at Trent Bridge.

Anderson is alleged to have pushed and verbally abused the India all-rounder and could face a ban of up to four Tests after being charged with a serious Level Three offence under the International Cricket Council’s Code of Conduct.

Heated: James Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja exchange words during the first Test at Trent Bridge

Article 2.3.3 of ICC's Code of Conduct

'Where the facts of the alleged incident are not adequately or clearly covered by any of the above offences, conduct that either: (a) is contrary to the spirit of the game; or (b) brings the game into disrepute'.

Level 3 penalty

All Level 3 breaches carry a penalty of between four and eight Suspension Points. Two suspension points equates to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player.

England’s key bowler exchanged words with both Jadeja and India captain MS Dhoni as they left the field and then the row escalated in the pavilion corridor.

India are adamant that Anderson instigated the physical clash but England counter that Jadeja was just as aggressive and had to be pulled away by Dhoni.

No punches were thrown between the pair as they began to climb the narrow Trent Bridge stairs to the dressing rooms while Sportsmail understands there is no suggestion that there was any racial element to the row.

Both sides settled down to lunch and England thought nothing more of it until they received a phone call from India coach Duncan Fletcher, who used to be in charge of England, on Monday saying they were pushing for the ban.

England expressed their ‘surprise’ at the charge, which came in an ICC statement, on Tuesday and vowed to support Anderson, who went on to become man of the match in the drawn first Test more for his batting than his bowling.

The ECB will make a counter-accusation blaming Jadeja as much as their man but will insist that both should face a lesser charge as they do not consider it to be serious and suspect India have a motive for pushing for the charge.

England believe that India want to push for a ban on Anderson because he is such a key figure in this series and are prepared to ‘sacrifice’ Jadeja, their second-choice spinner and a lower middle order batsman, in exchange.

The ICC will now appoint a Judicial Commissioner who will compile evidence over the next 14 days, meaning there is no danger of Anderson being banned for Thursday’s second Test nor the third match at the Ageas Bowl.

Yet if he is found guilty he could be banned for the last two Tests of the series at Old Trafford and the Kia Oval or, if England appeal, it could delay any suspension until the one-day series that immediately follows between the teams.

Sportsmail understands that it is very much at the instigation of Dhoni, who has long been irked by Anderson’s sledging, that India have pushed for the serious charge rather than sorting things out between the teams.

The Indian captain has long considered England to be an arrogant team, going back to the ‘jelly beans’ incident, also at Trent Bridge, between these nations seven years ago. Now he has his opportunity to hurt England.

The surprise is that this news, which came as a bolt from the blue after both teams had practiced on Tuesday, came when relations appeared to be cordial between the teams, certainly off the field where ECB chairman Giles Clarke has been involved in an ICC ‘power’ grab’ with the boards of India and Australia.

The only hint of bad feeling on the pitch came towards the end of Anderson’s world record last-wicket stand of 198 with Joe Root when Ishant Sharma exchanged words with Root after having an appeal for caught behind turned down. Ironically, the fiery Anderson acted as peace-maker and pushed Root away.

Now that ‘peace’ has been blown out of the water and the charge has guaranteed added spice when the teams take to the field for tomorrow’s second Test, when Anderson is unlikely to hold back when he bowls at Dhoni.

‘James Anderson categorically denies the charge made against him,’ said the ECB of a ‘minor incident’ in a statement made to pre-empt the governing body. ‘The ECB have pledged their total support of the player.’

Sportsmail understands that the umpires were not involved in the reporting of the matter and were quite happy to let the matter lie before India team manager Sunil Dev made the official complaint to the ICC.

Dev said on Tuesday night he lodged the complaint only after talks with Dhoni. ‘The captain and everyone complained that he physically touched him,’ said the India manager. ‘It was all over the dressing room. It is a serious matter because you can’t push anybody. So I complained to the match referee.’

It means that Anderson could face unprecedented punishment for an England player. ‘All Level Three offences carry a penalty of between four and eight suspension points,’ said the ICC’s statement. ‘Two suspension points equate to a ban of one Test, or two ODIs, depending on which type of match is scheduled next for the suspended player.’

England will strongly dispute the charge but will see how the state of the series lies before deciding whether they will appeal in the event of a ban. Whatever happens next, the touchpaper for four remaining Tests has just been ignited.

The angelic looking Joe Root winds up Australia opener David Warner so much in the VIP area of the Walkabout bar in Birmingham that the loudmouth Aussie punches the young Tyke.

BROAD WALK (July)

The mother of all rows erupts when Stuart Broad edges an Ashton Agar delivery to Aussie captain Michael Clarke at first slip. Incredibly, umpire Aleem Dar fails to spot the huge nick, Broad stands his ground... and there follows all manner of hypocritical spoutings from Aussies over not walking.

TROTT TORMENT (Nov)

Bully boy Warner is at it again, this time with the verbals, saying Jonathan Trott is ‘poor, weak and looked scared’ facing Mitchell Johnson. Trott was already on his way home, suffering from a ‘stress-related condition’.

MANKAD MESS (June 2014)

Controversy at Edgbaston as  Sri Lanka spinner Sachithra Senanayake — who himself was later suspended over a suspect action — runs out England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler for backing up too far, a dismissal known as a Mankad. The bad blood spills over into the Test series.
