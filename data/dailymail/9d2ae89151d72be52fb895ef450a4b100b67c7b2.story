New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has been urged to focus on strengthening their defence by club legend Bryan Robson.

The Red Devils' backline is already without experienced central defensive duo Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand, who have both left, while veteran left-back Patrice Evra is set to join Italian champions Juventus in a £2.5million transfer.

United signed sought-after England full-back Luke Shaw from Southampton in a £27million deal in June and have been heavily linked with moves for Arsenal's Thomas Vermalen, Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels as well as Feyenoord's Stefan de Vrij.

Van Gaal is currently getting to know his newly inherited squad on a pre-season tour of America and Robson believes it's necessary for the Dutchman to bolster a depleted backline as a first priority if the Old Trafford outfit is to return to the top domestically next season.

'When I look at us, I just think losing Nemanja and Rio and conceding goals last year means can we get a really good centre-half?' he told the Daily Mirror.

'I think that's more important than a central midfield player at this moment in time.

'When you look back we've nearly always had a really dominant player who is brilliant in the air and an organiser. If you go back, we've had Rio, Nemanja, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Jaap Stam.

'We've always had a centre-half who is as good as any player aerially, talks to people and is a leader. I feel we need that type of centre-half to improve the team. I can definitely see another couple of players coming into the club.'
