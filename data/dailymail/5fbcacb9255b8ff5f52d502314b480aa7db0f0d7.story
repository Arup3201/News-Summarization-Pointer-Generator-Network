A breast cancer test which could save thousands of women the ordeal of chemotherapy is to be made available on the NHS.

The test can accurately predict the chances of a tumour returning once it has been removed by surgery.

From today, doctors will be urged by the NHS rationing body NICE to offer women the test, called Oncotype DX, to check whether they really need chemotherapy.

Thousands of women with breast cancer could be spared chemotherapy every year thanks to a test which has been approved for use on the NHS

At present, about half of the 48,000 
women diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK every year undergo a course
 of this debilitating treatment after the tumours are taken out.

This
 is meant to eradicate any cancer cells that have broken away from the 
main tumour, which could cause the illness to spread to other parts of 
the body.

But many women with the illness have a very low-risk form that is unlikely to spread.

Experts
 estimate that between 4,000 and 5,000 women a year with this low-risk 
breast cancer are needlessly being put through exhausting chemotherapy.

It usually lasts three to six months and causes hair loss, sickness and tiredness and may leave women permanently infertile.

But
 from now on, doctors will be urged to offer women the test – which 
costs £2,580 a time – whenever they are uncertain about the risk of the 
cancer returning. In three quarters of cases, doctors can estimate how 
likely the tumour is to return just by looking at its size and how 
quickly it has grown.

The genetic test could benefit those with early-stage breast cancer facing the intensive treatment, which has side effects include nausea, vomiting, insomnia, hair loss and fatigue

But 
the remainder of women (about 9,000 a year) have what is termed 
‘intermediate-risk’ cancer and it is very difficult for doctors to 
assess it.

Nearly all of 
these women are given chemotherapy just in case even though about half 
may not need it. The new test works by analysing small samples of the 
tumour after surgery.

The 
samples will be posted by doctors to a lab in Redwood City, California, 
where they are put through a machine that closely looks at 21 genes.

Studies have suggested that half of women with the most common form of early breast cancer could be spared chemotherapy. Image shows breast cancer cells

The
 machine then comes up with a score of between zero and 100 based on the
 chance of the tumour returning. Patients who score zero to 18 will be 
told they don’t need chemotherapy while those over 31 will be urged to 
have the treatment.

When patients get a score of between 18 and 31, doctors will use their own discretion.

Professor
 Carole Longson of the Health Technology Evaluation Centre at NICE, 
said: ‘Breast cancer patients face significant emotional and 
psychological strain when considering chemotherapy.

‘A
 test that can help to predict better the risk of the breast cancer 
spreading, and therefore the potential likely benefit of additional 
chemotherapy, represents a significant step forward for patients.’

Sally Greenbrook, senior policy officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘This is a good decision from NICE.’

Recently other researchers have developed far cheaper versions of the test including one, ICH4, which costs just £120 a time.

But
 NICE said it needed to look at more evidence about the success of this 
test –invented by doctors at London’s Royal Marsden hospital – before 
recommending its use across the NHS.

It comes in the wake of the release earlier this week of a new jab which will revolutionise breast cancer treatment.

NHS England has given the go-ahead to the Herceptin injection being used.

It takes just five minutes  to administer and is estimated to save the NHS £20million  a year.

Nice has approved the Oncotype DX test for use on the NHS

It examines genes taken from the tumour to establish if it will spread

Doctors will use the test with other information, such as the size and grade of the tumour, to 
work out if chemotherapy could be beneficial
