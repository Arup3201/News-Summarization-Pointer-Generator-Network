A cursed coconut has been seized by police near a polling station in the Maldives igniting fears a black witch is trying to rig the country's upcoming election with a voodoo spell.

The furry fruit was spotted near a school on Guraidhoo Island on Tuesday with suspicious Arabic writing scribbled on its shell.

Closer inspection found the script to be a verse from the Koran prompting officers to summon a specialist white witch to reverse the spell.

Case cracked: The furry fruit was spotted near a school on Guraidhoo Island on Tuesday with Arabic writing on its shell

'The police brought a "ruqyah" practitioner (white magician) to examine the coconut, who said it was a fake,' a police source told Minivan News. 'Because it’s a fake the police are not worried.'

'The four-inch coconut had a Sura [Qur'anic verse] written in Arabic and was lying on the ground near the school, easy for the public to see,' added another source.

'When school students saw the coconut they called the principal, who then contacted the police.'

After studying the coconut, the 'ruqyah' deemed it to be nothing more than a hoax.

The source added: 'Now the police and school officials are more aware and police are 
patrolling the school at night, so magicians can’t practice real black 
magic at the school.'

Magic vote: Using black magic to either stop people voting or to influence their decision is common practice on the Maldives

Now, with the case apparently cracked, the country's presidential elections have been given the go ahead and will take place on Saturday.

Using black magic to either stop people voting or to influence their decision is common practice on Guraidhoo.

In July parents at the same school boycotted a polling station on the premises claiming a black witch was on the island and was trying to influence the fortunes of the Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM).

'Girls in the school were getting headaches and some have fainted,' the island source told Minivan.

The Maldives, whose population is just 300,000, introduced democratic elections in 2008, after 30 years of autocratic rule.

Its legal system is based on English common law interwoven with elements of Sharia Law.
