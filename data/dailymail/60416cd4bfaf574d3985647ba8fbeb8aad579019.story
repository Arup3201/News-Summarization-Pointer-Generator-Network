It's a mouthwatering sight; a generous and juicy burger patty wodged into a seeded bun and covered in ketchup, resting atop gooey cheese, crisp lettuce and succulent tomatoes.

These pictures of perfectly fried eggs, gorgeous iced-cakes and stunning pastries all look good enough to eat - but if you do try to taste them, you'll end up with a mouthful of paint as they are actually oil paintings.

The stunning hyper-realistic images of food are the work of Dutch artist Tjalf Sparnaay, who creates delicious-looking representations of everyday food.

Good enough to eat: A juicy hamburger stuffed with salad and covered in ketchup and melted cheese

Iced fancy: A cake covered in yellow icing and topped with a swirl of cream and a cherry 

Mr Sparnaay wrote on his website: 'My paintings are intended to enable the viewer to experience the reality again, again letting discover the essence of the object that has become so commonplace. 

'I want to return to the DNA of the universal structure in all its beauty. 

'I call it "the beauty of the ordinary".'

The 61-year-old is regarded as one of the most important painters in the international Hyperrealism art movement and has has been working on his Mega Realism series from 1987.

Is this really choux?: Chocolate covered pastry with a swirl of whipped cream and topped with a strawberry 

Sundae success: A paper umbrella perched on scipps of ice-cream in an old-fashioned sundae gladss 

The artist is always looking for new and never painted images which he finds in his own environment.

'Using trivial and everyday objects I let flow back to reality again from my brush,'  he wrote.

'My intention is to give these objects a soul, a presence.'

Mr Sparnaay said he aims to produce work which the viewer will find recognisable, accessible, everyday and simple.

Feast for the eyes: Ham and egg roll spills out with tomatoes, lettuce and mayonnaise 

He added: 'I hope my paintings will allow the viewer to re-experience reality, to re-discover the essence of the thing that has become so ordinary from its DNA to the level of universal structure, in all its beauty. 

'In an image-saturated era where anything can be reproduced anywhere in unlimited quantities, it has become apparent that rare, unique, powerful images are cherished more deeply than ever before.'

The Netherlands based artist's work is now displayed worldwide. Prices for original works range from €17,500 (£13,200) to over €120,000 (£90,000) and are dependent on size. He also accepts commissions.
