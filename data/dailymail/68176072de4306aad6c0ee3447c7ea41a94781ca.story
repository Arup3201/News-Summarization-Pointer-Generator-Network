What happened? On Thursday, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities confirmed that local police chief William McCollom shot his wife in the bedroom of their home early New Year's Day. Margaret was last listed in critical condition at Atlanta Medical Center

Wife No.2: Suzanne Carter is a rabbi who was the police department chaplain in Delray Beach, Florida when McCollon was chief. They married in 2002 and divorced in 2014 after she claims he cheated on her

Scene: McCollom  called 911 shortly after 4am on January 1 to report that he accidentally shot his wife

The police chief calmly told the dispatcher that he needed medical assistance for an accidental gunshot would at his suburban Atlanta home.

The dispatcher asked, 'Who shot her.'

McCollom answered, 'Me. The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, and I put it to the side an' it went off.' 

McCollom and Maggie lived together for two years before McCollom's divorce from Suzanne came through last year. In court papers, obtained by MailOnline, Suzanne claimed he had 'engaged in an extra-marital relationship.'

The tangled marriage-go-round that led up to Thursday's 4 a.m. shooting adds new intrigue to the incident that has shocked the leafy Atlanta suburb of Peachtree City.

McCollom, 57, called 911 to say he had accidentally shot his wife, a former emergency-room nurse, twice with his police-issued Glock 9 mm. handgun. But it was later determined that she had only been hit once.

Investigators have not revealed whether alcohol or drugs were involved in the shooting.

McCollom has now been placed on paid administrative leave by authorities in the city of 34,000, 30 miles south of Atlanta, as investigations into the shooting get underway. No charges have yet been filed.

The city's police have handed the case to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) due to McCollom's rank. The police chief is said to be cooperating fully.

After being interviewed on Thursday, McCollom went to the hospital to be with his wife. It is understood the couple's daughter, has also flown to Atlanta to be by her mother's side.

McCollom had only been Peachtree City's chief of police since October, earning $115,000 a year. He joined the force as assistant chief two years ago and was made interim chief in July after the previous chief Skip Clark stepped down suddenly.

Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that charges are possible. 'We’ll keep an open mind about this, and certainly the GBI has taken an open mind. The police department has been incredibly cooperative with them as they gave the facts they need. When we have those facts, we’ll see if it’s appropriate to bring charges.'

McCollom beat out 53 other applicants for the $91,000-a-year job. His appointment was heavily criticized locally at the time with accusations of cronyism as then chief Clark had come to Peachtree City from Juno Beach, Florida, less than 15 miles from Tequesta

William and Maggie McCollom were married in the late 1980s and divorced in 1999, documents show. For 22 years he worked for the Delray Beach police department in Florida, rising to the rank of assistant chief. While there, he met Suzanne Carter, a rabbi, who was the department's chaplain.

But he suddenly quit the Delray force in 2006 to become chief of police in the much smaller Florida beach town of Tequesta — taking a $20,000-a-year pay cut. He left that job in 2010 so he could look after his ailing sister in Wyoming.

While in Wyoming — his home state — McCollom worked as a general contractor, and only returned to law enforcement when he moved to Georgia in 2012 to a newly created position of assistant police chief in Peachtree City.

He beat out 53 other applicants for the $91,000-a-year job. His appointment was heavily criticized locally at the time with accusations of cronyism as then chief Clark had come to Peachtree City from Juno Beach, Florida, less than 15 miles from Tequesta.

After the McColloms' marriage broke down, William McCollom wed Rabbi Carter. But that marriage also failed. McCollom and Carter were only divorced last year, two years after he and Maggie had moved into the three-bedroom home where Thursday's shooting took place.

McCollom called 911 at 4.17 am on New Year's Day to say he had accidentally shot his wife twice. She was airlifted to Atlanta Medical Center in critical condition.

In the call he said his wife was having difficulty breathing and appeared to be suffering from both internal and external bleeding. She can be heard crying in the background.

'Oh my God," the police chief said. 'How the hell did this happen?'

Lt. Mark Brown, of Peachtree City Police Department told reporters at a New Year's Day press conference that McCollom is 'very well-liked' by those who work under him.

'The department is hurting,' said Brown. 'We're very concerned for his wife and the chief. We're just trying to make sure everything is done correctly as far as the investigation goes.'

According to Mrs McCollom's Facebook, she is licensed practical nurse who used to work in an emergency room.  

A neighbor who lives across the street from the McColloms described them as a 'loving couple' who 'do a lot of things together' and that he says he has 'never seen any problems over there', according to Fox.
