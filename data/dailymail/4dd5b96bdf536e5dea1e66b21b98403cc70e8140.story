Apple could be the next tech giant to launch a phone with a curved design.

In fact, sources have told Bloomberg the company is working on two larger-screen curved handsets, expected to launch by the end of next year.

The person ‘familiar with the plans’ said Apple is developing a 4.7-inch as well as a 5.5-inch model to rival Samsung and LG’s latest bendy handsets.

Sources claim Apple is working on 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones with curved displays to rival Samsung's Galaxy Round and LG's G Flex. The new handsets are said to be 'still in development' meaning they may not be released until at least September 2014

Apple announced last week it plans to open a mineral plant in Arizona that will make components for its high-end phones and tablet.

It
 has partnered with GT Advanced Technology, suppliers of sapphire-based 
materials, and this has led many to believe Apple’s next generation of 
screens could feature strong, scratch-resistant sapphire glass.

The
 firm already uses sapphire glass in the fingerprint scanner of its 
iPhone 5S, as well as to protect the camera lenses on its new devices.

According to Bloomberg journalists Tim Culpan and Adam Satariano, the two phones are expected to curve along the side edges.

This would make them more like LG’s G Flex handset, rather than Samsung’s Round phone which curves along the top and bottom edges.

Reports added Apple’s curved glass could also come with sensors capable of identifying how heavy, or light, a user’s touch is, meaning it could distinguish different pressure points.

The benefits of this feature have not been explained.

Both of Apple's new handsets are said to be ‘still in development’ meaning they may not be released until at least September 2014.

This would coincide with Apple’s annual product launch. 

The two rumoured Apple phones are expected to curve along the side edges. This would make them more like LG's G Flex phone, pictured, rather than Samsung's Round handset that curves along the top and bottom edges. If Apple does follow LG's lead, the phones would curve comfortably with a user's face

Samsung released its curved Galaxy Round phone, pictured,in October, followed shortly by LG's G Flex phone. Both phones are only currently available in Korea. The Round is curved along the top to make it more comfortable to hold in the hand

Samsung released its curved Galaxy Round last month, followed shortly by LG’s G Flex phone – yet both are only currently available in Korea.

Apple has traditionally stuck with smaller screens, and its latest iPhone 5C and 5S devices are only 4-inches big.

This is compared to LG's G Flex, for example, which as a 6-inch screen while the Galaxy Round's display is 5.7 inches big.

Other features of the Galaxy Round that take advantage of the curved display include what's dubbed Roll Effect.

This
 lets users roll the phone towards them to see the date, time, missed 
calls and battery life without pressing the power button or activating 
the home screen.

Apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant that uses sapphire-based materials. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its iPhone 5S, pictured, and to protect the cameras on its latest models. Rumours now claim Apple could use the plant to make strong sapphire glass screens

Rumours have suggested for almost a year
 Apple could be looking to increase the size of its displays to compete 
with its rivals' larger phones and ‘phablet’ gadgets built between 
five and seven inches big.
