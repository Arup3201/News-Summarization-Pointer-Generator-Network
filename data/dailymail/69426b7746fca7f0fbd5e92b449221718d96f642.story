Random: PC Andy Hall, left, from Greater Manchester Police's Radcliffe policing team has stopped tweeting from the force's official account. His bizarre and comic comments are thought to have upset police bosses

A popular police officer has stopped using his force's social networking account after being accused of posting too many humourous and bizarre comments on Twitter.

PC Andy Hall, 38, had been assigned to pen his own messages on the social networking site, dubbed Tweets from the Beat, to encourage more locals to report crime.

But his bosses intervened when the constable started to post a number of comic messages on Greater Manchester Police's official GMP Radcliffe account.

Among his random postings were song lyrics, commentary on the X Factor and gags about former pop stars.

The officer also used the account to highlight the inflated price of confectionery alongside the hashtag £crimeupdate, including posts saying 'Cadburys Starbar 78p!!? Maltesers 80p!!!'

PC Hall would give regular weather reports and
affectionately referred to his beat of Radcliffe, near Bury, Greater 
Manchester, as 'Radders'.

The officer also posted a child's drawing of himself as well as a tub of unopened lentil soup.

The GMP Radcliffe account had been set up 
last June after Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy
encouraged its use to help 'engage' with the public.

Senior officers eventually stepped in 
after a lighthearted tweet was inadvertently posted just hours after a 
fatal police pursuit in Radcliffe.

Jack Christian, 22, and Lee Perris, 
23, died after their Volkswagen Polo crashed as they were fleeing a 
police patrol on Sunday morning.

Comic: Some of PC Hall's random tweets, above, garnered him a positive reputation online, with some Twitter users calling him a 'legend'

Community outreach: PC Hall's tweets often featured song recommendations and weather updates

Later that day, the message 'I will 
find. I will hunt you down' was posted on the GMP Radcliffe account.

The message, however, was in response to another Twitter user and unrelated to the
tragedy.

Senior officers are thought to have spoken to PC Hall and he agreed to hand over his tweeting duties to colleagues.

Twitter users condemned the police intervention today after PC Hall signed off with the message: 'I'm going back out on to your streets, where I belong. This is my last ever tweet. See you out there. Take good care Radders. I'm Andy Hall?'

Catherine Elizabeth wrote: 'We still love you Andy Hall.Not your fault your bosses are shrivelled up dinosaurs who have no idea how to reach the people.'

Another user, known as Stepperz, wrote: 'Absolutely farcical that Andy Hall has been stood down, i will be making my feelings known to his not so superiors.'

And Warren Bridge said: 'Well done @GMPRadcliffe I guess policemen are no longer allowed to have a personality. £justiceforandyhall.'

Encouragement: Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Sir Peter Fahy, above, has encouraged officers to engage with the public on social networks

In 2010 the force published a Twitter summary of every incident officers attended over a 24-hour period after Sir Peter said he wanted to show only a third of the incidents his team responds to are genuine crimes.

The GMPRadcliffe account has almost 2,000 followers on Twitter.

PC Hall amassed a number of fans, with some describing him as a 'legend'.

But the officer also divided opinion with some  controversial messages.

He once wrote: 'Urgent message to the woman I've just seen in R'cliffe town centre wearing hot pants! Put clothes on! You'll catch a cold! It's winter!!'

Another said: 'Last night I dreamt that the ghost of Gloria Gaynor was stood at the end of the bed. First I was afraid, I was petrified....I'm Andy Hall!'

Another read: 'We're off duty half hour. Instead of me dedicating songs for you, Tweet me you songs for us. Best one wins a free 2012 calendar.'

Greater Manchester Police said PC Hall had not been banned from using the force's Twitter account but agreed to stand down voluntarily.

They confirmed officers with access to the GMP Radcliffe account had been given advice regarding the messages.

A spokesman said: 'Our neighbourhood officers share information and speak to the communities they serve and we encourage them to use social media to do this.

'We receive positive feedback from people who use networks to speak to their officers. Officers receive training and support but we accept this is a new way of communicating and we will not always get it right.

'This is why we continually ask people for their views and use it to improve what we do.'

Commentary: PC Andy Hall wrote about everything from the X Factor to his soup

'Everyday is like Sunday! Classic Morrissey there easing us out of bed!! Good morning Radders. How are we? Andy back with you. Updates on way.'

'Stay safe & classy Radders. Here's T'pau & 'China in your hand'.'

'Goodmorning Radders. How the devil are we? Andy Hall back with you. I feel the need, the need for speed. Take my breath away...Ooooosshhhh.'

'Nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Nobody does it better. Radders your the best! Goodmorning!! Andy Hall back with you..'

'It's just another Manic Monday, I wish it were Sunday...Classic Bangles! It's a steady day in Radders.'

'Little darling, here comes the sun & I say it's alright...Goodmorning R'cliffe. How are we? It's sunny but cold out. You might need a vest!'

'Wake up Radders!If I'm up, you're up! Have 5 more mins then.It's too cold to get up.I had to use my Wham cd to scrape ice off my windscreen!'

'Are we human or are we dancer? Classic Killers! Morning Radders. How are we? It's Monday. It's cold & wet but at least we've got each other.'

'Right Radders I'm done for the day. I came in the fog. I leave in the sun. I'm back at 8am. Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast!'

'I've just had some Nik Naks, they're knobbly, wacky sticks of corn. I'm undecided which is the best flavour! Rib , Spicy or Scampi...'

'You can't stop clickin at me Writin' 'bout me, tweeting 'bout me, I can't stop, it's what I gon' be, My swagger's in check...'
