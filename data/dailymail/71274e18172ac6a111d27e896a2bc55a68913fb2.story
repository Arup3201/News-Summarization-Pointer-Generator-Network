These breathtaking pictures show the magnificent Glastonbury Tor appearing like a beacon above a glittering landscape in the early morning light.

The view over the Somerset Levels was truly remarkable, as much of the UK awoke to frost covering the ground and temperatures well below freezing.

Only a few dog walkers were visible outdoors as the sun rose on a bitterly cold day, bracing themselves against what is one of the coldest starts to November in years for many towns.

Revellers at Bonfire Night parties last night wrapped themselves in coats and scarves in the biting cold to watch fireworks sparkle in the chill night air.

Families shivered as their breath turned to vapour on a freezing evening, with temperatures reaching a low of -4.6C in North Yorkshire last night and dipping below zero in many areas.

Households suffering in the biting weather will, for once, be grateful for cloud, which is now moving in from the north.

The
cloud looks set to move down across the country through the week, 
bringing slightly warmer temperatures and patchy rain, until 
temperatures dip again for the weekend.

With
winter creeping in, the vibrant sight of a Virgina Creeper on the wall of St 
John's College has vanished for another year - leaving the historic New Court lit only by the bright minds of Cambridge's students.

Just weeks ago, this beautiful scarlet and gold creeper dazzled in the historic grounds of Cambridge University.

Now the wall of St John's College is stark and bare, as winter tightens its icy grip on Britain and frost covers the ground.

Fortunately, the dedicated students seem to be sticking to their studies in spite of the frosty weather,  as proved by undergraduate Casey Swerner, 20,  pictured reading in his window.

The Johnian was seen still sat in the same position as a month ago, leafing through a book on the windowsill of his student halls.

Meanwhile, millions of starlings flocked to Scotland as mainland Europe grew colder, gathering in the soft pink skies over Gretna at dusk last night.

The birds put on a mesmerising performance as they wheeled and swooped, silouhetted in the cool evening air.

Their population in Scotland swells to three million in November, when they fly in from Europe to roost, creating a magical spectacle known as a ‘murmuration’.

Neil O’Donnell, of the RSPB in South and West Scotland, said: 'During the day the birds go out to feed, then they all come back to roost in the evening. They feel a lot safer roosting together.

'The starlings base their movements on the birds around them and so this is why you do not see them bump into each other.

'The birds form a cloud in the sky, and appear to move as though they were a single being.'

The starlings will stay until February before flying back to continental Europe for the spring and summer.

Helen Chivers of the Met Office said today: 'The lowest temperature last night was 4.6C in Topclisse, North Yorkshire, with Oxfordshire experiencing -41.C. Near Dorset we had -3.5C.

Safety in numbers: They flock together to protect themselves from predators

Twitter storm: In winter, the Scottish population of starlings swells to two or three million

Single being: Starlings base their movements on the birds around them so they do not bump into each other

'We now have some cloud and rain moving in across northern parts and the cloud will move south over the rest of England.

'This means temperatures will rise a little, and it will be cloudy with a bit of brightness and the odd spot of rain - though not a huge amount.

'Temperatures will return to a normal 10-12C during the day. At the weekend, the frost will be back again with this chilly autumn weather back on Friday.

'It will be too mild through the week for snow anywhere, however. It will be quiet and calm.'

Some parts of the UK have experienced one of the coldest starts to November for years, following a hugely disappointing summer.

Forecasters have said this looks set to be a colder winter than average. Firework displays were cancelled over weekend and last night because of wet weather.
