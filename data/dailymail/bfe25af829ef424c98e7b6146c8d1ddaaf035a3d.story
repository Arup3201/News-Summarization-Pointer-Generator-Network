It was supposed to be a ‘playful’ publicity stunt.

But when TV comedian Lee
Nelson pretended to steal his own DVD at a record-store signing last 
night, things didn't go quite to plan.

After 'stealing' the DVD, the BBC comedian sprinted out of HMV in central London’s Oxford Street, chased by an actor in a fake police uniform.

Struggle: When TV comedian Lee Nelson pretended to steal his own DVD at a record-store signing last night, things didn't go quite to plan after a PCSO helped an actor restrain him

But after ending up on the busy street, south London tearaway Lee Nelson - a creation of comic Simon Brodkin - was spotted by a real police community support officer who mistook him for a shoplifter.

He then became involved in trying to arrest the 'thief'.

Shoppers looked on amazed and traffic came to a halt as a struggle took place.

The three men rolled around in the middle of the road before the PCSO marched the comedian back into HMV and forced him to the ground.

The store had been packed for a signing of Lee Nelson’s first DVD when the comedian - who is played by 35-year-old actor Simon Brodkin - carried out the stunt.

But not all bystanders saw the funny side.

Stunt: After 'stealing' the DVD, the BBC comedian sprinted out of HMV in central London's Oxford Street where an actor chased him along with a real PCSO who detained him

Shopper Richard Hampshire, 67, a retired civil servant, said: ‘I thought it was disgusting, a cheap stunt.

‘The PCSO was just doing his job and it was quite a dangerous situation.

‘They were wrestling in the middle of the road, there could have easily been an accident.

‘It was completely irresponsible and quite distressing - a lot of people thought it was a real incident.’

Mr Brodkin was last night in unapologetic mood.

He posted a picture on Twitter of the incident, with the words, ‘HMV signing’s going well’.

Asked to comment on the stunt, he issued a statement in the character of Lee Nelson, in which he said: ‘How can you get arrested for nicking your own DVD? 

‘Mr Loophole lawyer, if you’re reading this, get me off and I’ll sort you out with the 20 other DVDs I took.’

Mr Brodkin, a former doctor who gave up his medical career to pursue work as a stand-up, stars in his own BBC Three show, Lee Nelson’s Well Good Show, and has written for and appeared with comedians Al Murray and Jason Manford.

Scene: This is the store where the 'altercation' took place

A spokeswoman for Mr Brodkin said: ‘He 
was doing a signing for his DVD at HMV in Oxford Street, and as a treat 
for his fans he ‘stole’ one of his own DVDs, then was chased around the 
store by an actor dressed up as a police officer.

‘Somehow they ended up out on the pavement, where a real police community support officer got involved, thinking it was a theft taking place.

‘Shoppers were looking on and buses were stopping, it was all very dramatic.

‘The community support officer brought him back into the store where it was explained that it hadn’t been a real theft taking place.’

The controversy comes after Mr Brodkin caused outrage on Sunday with a comment about Coventry Blitz just before he was due to perform in the town.

He posted on the Lee Nelson Twitter account: ‘Just arrived in Coventry. They must be hoping it gets bombed again soon!’

Coming just days after the 72nd 
anniversary of the city being reduced to rubble by the Luftwaffe, the 
comment was met with fury by Coventry residents.

A
spokesman for HMV said last night: ‘Lee was just having some fun with 
some staged shots inside the store to promote his new DVD, but he got a 
bit overexcited and ran outside as part of the act.

‘Unfortunately
there was a real PCSO there who wasn’t aware it was all staged, but he 
was a really good sport and was fine after we explained.

‘If anyone was alarmed then we’re sorry, but most people there could see it was just a bit of a playful stunt.’

Scotland Yard said it was aware of the incident but declined to comment further.
