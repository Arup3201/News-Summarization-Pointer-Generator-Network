Controversial: Clive Burgess was given a £74,000 increase in his pension and a £20,000 salary rise after being promoted two months before retirement

A senior police officer retired two months after securing a promotion that boosted his taxpayer-funded pension by £375,000, it has emerged.

Chief Superintendent Clive Burgess was made Assistant Chief Constable in November and given a £20,000 pay rise.

But by January the officer was working his last shift after  significantly bumping up his retirement fund.

It came just weeks before a colleague at West Midlands Police also left with up to £450,000 extra in a similar arrangement.

Sharon Rowe completed her final working day in May – just five months after being promoted from Assistant Chief Constable to temporary Deputy Chief Constable.

Altogether, the two promotions could cost taxpayers more than £830,000 in additional pension payments if the pair live to their average UK life expectancies.

Yesterday it emerged that Mr Burgess, 48, was interviewed for the new role just eight days after the force said that he would have to quit in January under the controversial A19 rule, when he would have reached 30 years’ service.

On November 11 he was promoted to Assistant Chief Constable, which exempted him from the measure – and boosted his annual salary from around £74,000 to £94,000.

Taking into account his lump sump entitlement and an annual pension pot for a life expectancy of 78, it means he can rake in an astonishing extra £374,829. He officially retired on April 1 after owed holiday was taken into account.

In Miss Rowe’s case – reported in the Mail last week – promotion saw her salary increase by 40 per cent to £140,000.

That equated to an extra £83,493 lump sum and £373,280 annual pension, taking her total promotion-linked payouts to £456,773.

Home: Mr Burgess, who lives in this £475,000 detached house in Coventry, is now believed to have secured a taxpayer-funded pension lump sum worth more than £350,000

Like Mr Burgess, Miss Rowe, 50, also had time off owed for holidays and only officially retired last month.

John Hemming, a Liberal Democrat MP in Birmingham, condemned the payouts as ‘common ploys’ to boost retirement packages across the public sector.

The revelations also come at  a time when West Midlands Police is carrying out recruitment freezes in an effort to save £150million.

The news of Mr Burgess's promotion comes a week after Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe (pictured with David Cameron in 2011) was set for a £450,000 pension bonus seven months after being promoted

Ray Egan, 75, who worked for the force for
 28 years, added: ‘It is morally repugnant that these two senior 
officers are being allowed to cash in large sums by hoodwinking the 
powers that be. It is just sheer greed.’

Next year, pay reforms will see police pensions based on average career earnings instead of a final salary figure.

West Midlands Police said both officers were promoted after a recruitment process led by the Chief Constable.

Mr Burgess yesterday declined to comment at his detached home in Coventry.

Boost: Mr Burgess's promotion earned him £49,333 in the two months before his retirement 

The salary rise from £74,000 to £94,000 led to a huge boost to Mr Burgess’ pension pot and potential tax-free lump sum.

Officers receive two thirds of their salary as annual pension upon retirement - but based on the best or highest salary year of their final three years.

Mr Burgess’ final year salary was a combination of 225 days at the salary at £74,000 and 140 days at £94,000, working out at around £82,000.

Under his Chief Superintendent salary, the senior officer would have received two thirds of his £74,0000 salary as an annual pension, working out at £49,333.

But his final year promotion means his annual pension rocketed to around £62,666 - a rise of £12,700 per annum.

Officers can cash in the maximum 25 per cent allowed of their pensions upon retirement, called commutation, to receive a lump sum and a reduced annual income.

If Mr Burgess cashed in the maximum 25 per cent of his former Chief Superintendent’s pension, he could have banked a £276,878 lump sum and a reduced annual pension payment of £47,000.

But his new final year salary means he can cash in the maximum 25 per cent and receive a £351,707 lump sum - an increase of £74,829.

His annual pension would then be set at £47,000 - up £10,000 on his previous figure.

That means if Mr Burgess had commuted the full 25 per cent of his pension by the time he reaches the average male life expectancy age of 78 he would have netted an extra £300,0000 annual pension.

This includes an extra £4,829 lump sum bonus - taking his total promotion-linked payouts to £374,829.

If the officer had not cashed in his lump sum and claimed his full £49,333 annual pension income on his old salary, he would have received around £1,479,990 million by the time he had reached 78.

But after promotion that figure, without any commutation, would have risen to £1,879,980 - a rise of around £400,000.
