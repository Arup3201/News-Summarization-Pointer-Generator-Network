Tragic: Christian Smith, 38, was killed instantly when he was hit by a suspected drink-driver hours into a 248-mile charity cycle ride

A second teenager has been arrested by officers investigating death of a cyclist who was hit and killed by a car during a charity ride at the weekend.

Christian Smith, 38, had almost completed the 248-mile, 24-hour trip through Kent and Sussex when he was hit by a car and declared dead at the scene in the early hours of Saturday.

Today, police said they had arrested a 19-year-old man from Herne Bay, in Kent, on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

They have already arrested an 18-year-old woman on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving, and both have been released on bail pending further investigations.

Mr Smith, a married father of three from Boughton Aluph, Kent, was declared dead at the scene by paramedics early on Saturday.

He was aiming to raise £1,000 for mental health charity Mind with his Kent Epic 24-hour ride.

By 1.30pm yesterday, £1,455 had been donated by 50 people, but as news of the tragedy spread, hundreds more visited his JustGiving donations website, and by lunchtime today, the total stood at more than £52,000.

One £1,000 donation came from a stranger who gave his name as James. He wrote: ‘We haven’t met. Like many others, I was very moved by your story. May you rest in peace brother. My deepest sympathies go out to your family, loved ones and friends.’

Mr Smith set off on his ‘Kent Epic’ challenge on Friday and was hit by a blue Peugeot 206 near Chestfield, Whitstable, at 4am the following morning. He is understood to have been less than two hours from home.

An 18-year-old woman from Herne Bay was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous driving. She has been bailed until July 26.

On his JustGiving page, Mr Smith, who was married to Katie, 40, said he wanted to support Mind to help end the stigma attached to mental health problems.

He wrote: ‘I have had my own 
misfortune to suffer from a spate of poor mental health which was 
unexpected and has been a real “game changer” in how I now view the 
future. It has been a tough road to get to this point but I have been 
fortunate enough to have the support of my family and friends.

Wellwishers have given thousands of pounds to mental health charity, Mind, in Mr Smith's memory

‘There
 are those who are not so fortunate to have the same level of support 
and understanding. They suffer in silence and are alone.’

Mr
 Smith planned to celebrate completing the 
challenge by having drinks with friends next Saturday. He would have 
turned 39 tomorrow.

On his 
online LinkedIn business profile, he said he had worked as an operations 
manager for a funeral director until December and was now ‘looking for a
 new challenge’.

His family
 said in a statement: ‘Christian Smith was killed in the early hours of 
Saturday morning while cycling to raise money for Mind. Christian leaves
 a loving wife and three children.’

Mind chief executive Paul Farmer said: ‘We were shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of Christian Smith.

‘Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.’

PC
 Jamie Woodhams, of the Kent Police Serious Collision Investigation 
Unit, said: ‘We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward. 
In particular we would like to speak to anybody who saw the Peugeot 
travelling along the road prior to the collision.’

The
 public response is similar to when 30-year-old hairdresser Claire 
Squires died during the London Marathon in 2012. She had hoped to raise 
£500 for Samaritans, but news of her death sent the total soaring to 
£1.2million.
