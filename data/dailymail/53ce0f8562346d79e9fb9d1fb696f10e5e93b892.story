The mobile communications technology race has taken an interesting turn with the release of plans for a smartphone with a dual display.

Tech giant Samsung has filed a patent for a phone with two interconnected touchscreens that can display two independent applications, or work together to give the user an enhanced experience in gaming, reading e-books, conference calls, web browsing and multi-tasking.

Pictures of the device have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office and show the potential benefits of the technology.

Seeing double: Samsung has filed a patent for a phone with dual displays

Samsung's filing contained more than a hundred patent figures broken into distinct categories such as calendars, photo cataloging and many more, reports Patentbolt.

The dual displays are connected by a hinge, which allows the as-yet-unnamed device to stand freely, similar to the rigid covers used by tablet owners.

This provides exciting gaming opportunities, as users can sit around a table with one screen visible to them and one on display to their opponents.

In terms of photos, the phone can display an image on one screen and photomanipulation tools on the other, allowing easy retouching.

The two screens could also display images and video across both screens for a more immersive experience.

The images in the patent filing also show an enhanced conference call function, where the participants' faces are shown at the top of the screen, while other data, such as a business presentation or scientific data, is displayed along the bottom.

It also acts as an e-reader, where the user can hold the two screens with text on both displays, a experience more akin to reading an actual book than usually afforded by conventional e-readers

Last month Samsung promised to introduce devices with fully folding displays to the general market in 2015.

1. Front and back touch screen technology

Earlier this month Samsung filed a patent for a phone with a transparent screen with touch screen technology on both the front and back have been revealed in what could be the next step forward in smartphone technology.

The plans for the future transparent display that can be controlled by fingertip from both sides of the phone.

Pictures of the device have been filed with the U.S. show the potential benefits of the technology, such as the user's finger not obscuring the screen when tapping on apps or dragging items around the screen.

2. Curved screen

The latest version of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphone could have a three-sided display, rumours suggest.

The new smartphone, which is tipped to launch next year, might sport a wrap-around display so that content on the curved screen can be read from extreme angles.

The display is likely to feature on Samsung’s Galaxy S or Note luxury handsets, but it could even be the first of a new line of curvier handsets, according to recent rumours.

3. The budget option

This week Samsung announced yet another handset in its Galaxy range of smartphones aimed at buyers on a budget.

The Galaxy Core Advance is a marginally improved version of the Galaxy Core, which the Korean firm launched in June, and the Galaxy Core Plus that launched in Taiwan in October.

It has the same 8GB basic storage as the Core, as well as the same camera, but comes with a slightly larger 4.7-inch screen. It is expected to retail at between £150 and £170.
