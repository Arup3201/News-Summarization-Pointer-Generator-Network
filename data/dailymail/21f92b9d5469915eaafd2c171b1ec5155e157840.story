Jose Mourinho's 'outstanding' recruitment policy is the reason Chelsea are so far ahead of their Premier League rivals, Gary Neville has claimed.

The Portuguese manager's side beat restored their three-point lead at the top of the Premier League table on Monday night after beating Stoke City 2-0.

John Terry and Cesc Fabregas scored for the hosts while Nemanja Matic and Thibaut Courtois were again impressive for the Blues.

And Neville believes it is those recent additions to the squad that have elevated Chelsea to a level above their rivals.

Speaking to Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football, Neville said: 'The recruitment of Jose Mourinho since he has come into Chelsea has been outstanding. Absolutely outstanding.

'He's identified what a team needs. Matic - straight in. Courtois - they brought him back. (Diego) Costa - a strong centre forward. Fabregas - they needed a little bit of creativity at times last season against teams that played with deep defences.

'The blend of what Chelsea have at the moment is why they will be fighting for the league with (Manchester) City, and why those two are streets ahead of everyone else.'

While Neville didn't single out any clubs for criticism, he did have a message for managers looking to add to their ranks in January

He said: 'To play in the centre midfield in the Premier League in a 38-game season which is a battle to win it, to not think that you're going to need physicality  - you're not going to do it through just technical ability. You're going to need to dig in there and fight and battle.
