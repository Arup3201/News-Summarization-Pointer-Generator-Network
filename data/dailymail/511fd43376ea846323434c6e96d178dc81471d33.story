Winston Reid's homecoming didn't go to script for the New Zealand Premier League star as West Ham were beaten by Wellington Phoenix at Auckland's Eden Park.

Sam Allardyce's side got more than they bargained for against the team which finish one place above the wooden spoon last A-League season and for Reid, who was handed the captain's armband for the occasion, it'll be a night to forget.

The Phoenix took a 2-0 lead into half-time and West Ham were only able to peg one back through new signing Mauro Zarate inside the closing 20 minutes.

Goal: Zarate

It took a slice of individual brilliance from Zarate, making his second appearance for the Hammers after a 33-minute shift in their 0-0 friendly against Ipswich, to give his side a chance to save face.

A slick side-step at the top of the penalty area and a powerful finish into the bottom left corner from the Argentinian gave keeper Glen Moss no chance. But the celebrations were muted from the tourists who knew this was rare show of class when the expectations were much higher from both their manager and the crowd.

Phoenix took the lead after just 11 minutes after Mark Noble was beaten for pace and gifted the Phoenx a free-kick, which Australian-born New Zealand international Durante headed home.

Alex Gorrin made it 2-0 with a solo run that left the Hammers' defence reeling and a solid finish past Jussi Jaaskelainen - it was a magic moment for the 20-year-old who joined Sunderland as a 16-year-old from Tenerife, in Spain, but was let go on a free transfer this season having not graduated from the academy system.

Chances to extend the lead kept coming for the 
hosts in the second half, including Nathan Burns' curling effort that stretched 
Jaaskelainen and added insult to injury for West Ham's opening hour.

Allardyce won't have been impressed, especially given Phoenix took the field minus three of their most important players from their last - albeit unsuccessful - campaign.

Substitutes rained onto Eden Park in the closing stages, as is customary in friendlies, with Diego Poyet making his debut after his free move from Charlton.

Another custom that won't have amused the Hammers came from the Phoenix fans, who traditionally take their tops off if their team is leading going into the final 10 minutes of a match.

Stewart Downing, who came on late, went close to an equaliser in the closing stages but was denied by Lewis Italiano, who made his club debut after a move from Perth when he replaced Moss.

Before the match, a traditional Maori haka issued a challenge to the Hammers they couldn't meet. Both sides also paid tribute to Newcastle United fans John Adler and Liam Sweeney, and those who were lost in the MH17 tragedy over the Ukraine.
