Skin taken from the dead could soon be used to treat wounds in the living.

Researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers that is stripped of its cells is effective in healing acute wounds, such as burns, as well as painful ulcers.

They believe the new treatment could be used to treat wounds that do not easily heal by themselves, which cost the US alone more than $25 billion (£17 billion) a year.

For decades, scientists have developed increasingly effective skin substitutes to help treat wounds, which aim to mimic the body’s extracellular matrix – the scaffolding of proteins and compounds that bind cells together, LiveScience reported.

They are now focusing on using real skin. A team of researchers led by Ardeshir Bayat, a bioengineer at the University of Manchester, used human skin from cadavers, which they decontaminated with antibiotics.

They then used a combination of detergents, enzymes and other chemicals to remove cells from the skin, so that the recipient’s immune system is less likely to react and cause a person’s body to reject the organ.

The experts stripped out the skin’s inner layer – the dermis – which contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles and sweat glands, to leave behind its matrix of proteins.

Artificial skin which could replace animals in drug and cosmetics testing was grown in a laboratory for the first time in April 2014.

Scientists in the UK and US were able to produce one centimetre-wide fragments of epidermis - the outermost skin layer - from stem cells with the same properties as real skin.

Scientists believe that in the future, lab-grown skin could be used for testing medicinal lotions and creams or cosmetics without causing suffering to animals.

It could also provide a model for investigating skin conditions such as eczema.

Dr Dusko Ilic, who led the British team from King's College London, said: 'Our new method can be used to grow much greater quantities of lab-grown human epidermal equivalents, and thus could be scaled up for commercial testing of drugs and cosmetics.

'Human epidermal equivalents representing different types of skin could also be grown, depending on the source of the stem cells used, and could thus be tailored to study a range of skin conditions and sensitivities in different populations.'

Dr Bayat likened this to an empty shell of a house without furniture that is easier to populate then building a house from scratch.

‘In the same way, decellularised dermis provides a scaffold that the body can try to populate with its own cells.’

The team discovered that ‘decellulised’ skin can be used to treat acute wounds, such as burns.

They removed four disks of skin, each measuring 0.2 inches (five millimetres) from 50 healthy volunteers, according to the study published in the journal Plos One.

One of the wounds was left to heal naturally, another had the disk of removed skin, re-attached, the third was treated with a man-made skin substitute and the fourth, was decellulised skin from a cadaver.

They found that the skin from the cadaver was the best at triggering growth of new blood vessels and was a strong as the volunteer’s own skin. 

It could also rebuild scar tissue. 

The advantage of using it over artificial skin is that the body is familiar with its structure.

Dr Bayat plans on testing the ‘decelluarised’ skin on more patients as well as adding electrical stimulation to see if this accelerates the healing process.

The team has previously proved that skin from cadavers can be used to treat chronic wounds that have not healed in six to eight weeks, or in some cases, years.

Dr Bayat said that he had a patient who was 92 years old who had suffered with a skin ulcer for 20 years.

‘After we treated her with decellularised dermis, she healed within four weeks,’ he said.

The number of people with ulcers is expected to rise in line with ageing populations. This is because conditions linked to skin wounds, such as diabetes and obesity become more common.
