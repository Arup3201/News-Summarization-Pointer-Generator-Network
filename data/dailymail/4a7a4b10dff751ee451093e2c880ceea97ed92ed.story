It seems the financial woes facing the owners of Downton Abbey are worse than anyone imagined.Cora, Countess of Grantham, has been reduced to wearing an outfit made out of a tablecloth - and her daughter Edith has a second-hand coat which is older than she is.

In the new series, both of the characters have been seen clad in recycled costumes that have appeared in a host of other shows.

Edith sported the garment as she travelled to London for a dalliance with her married lover (l) and The House of Eliott, 1994, costume seen on Louise Lombard as Evangeline Eliott (r)

In the first episode, Edith, played by 
Laura Carmichael, wore a coat that TV viewers first saw in the 
Seventies. Edith sported the garment as she travelled to London for a 
dalliance with her married lover Michael Gregson, played by Charles 
Edwards.

The transformation of Edith from dowdy spinster to sexy socialite has been a key plot-line recently - as has her family's battle to stave off  financial disaster. 

Edith's coat was originally worn in 1974
 by actress Rosalind Ayres when she played Christable Carstairs in an 
episode of The Father Brown Mysteries. Twenty years later the coat 
appeared in the BBC drama The House Of Eliott.

Actress Louise Lombard, who played Evangeline Eliott, wore it in an episode broadcast in 1994.

The coat then made its big-screen debut 
in 1997 when an extra wore it in a film adaptation of Virginia Woolf's 
Mrs Dalloway, starring Vanessa Redgrave.

Lady Cora's floral-patterned white 
silk coat, the material for which came from an embroidered tablecloth, 
also appeared in The House Of Eliott, worn by Stella Gonet, who played 
Evangeline's elder sister Beatrice.

In
 2003, it was worn by Beatriz Batarda, who played Annette Forsyte in The
 Forsyte Saga - and nine years later it made its debut  in Downton with 
Lady Cora, played by Elizabeth McGovern.

A spokesman for costume company Cosprop, which provided the coat for The House Of Eliott and Downton, said: 'It's a pretty coat but it also looks fresh and I think that is why it has remained popular. It is not a case of one size fits all - but it is a coat that compliments many looks.

'Susan Hampshire also wore it on TV, in The Grand, and it almost looked like a dressing gown.

'You can use it on a variety of women and it has appeared on  ladies in their 20s and 50s.'

Fans should not expect to see the silk coat in any other current programmes.

Cosprop has embargoed it - which means it can't be used elsewhere during the latest Downton. The history of the costumes was tracked by website Recycled Movie Costumes.
