Cold calling companies should give up harassing people on the phone because almost no-one will choose to do business with them, a consumer group said today.

More than 9 in 10 people say they do not trust firms which call them out of the blue.

Bill payers report being exasperated by personal injury lawyers, power firms and offers of cheap double glazing.

More than 90 per cent of people do not trust the firms which call them out of the blue, as MPs call for action against the companies who plague us by phone

Citizens Advice is calling for financial companies, including payday lenders and claims management firms, to be banned from cold calling.

According to a survey carried out for the consumer group, 92 per cent of people do not trust the companies who have sales reps pester them for business.

Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said it was proof cold calling does not work and is ‘nothing more than a nuisance’.

She added: ‘It is time companies hang-up marketing plans that bombard people with unwanted phone calls, text messages and automated voicemails.  Nine in 10 people don’t trust companies that cold-call which is indicative of marketing that is nothing more than a nuisance. 

‘I’d like to see financial service companies banned from cold calling. Citizens Advice is helping people who have been left seriously out of pocket after signing up to a service over the phone only to find it doesn’t deliver what was promised.

Lib Dem MP Mike Crockart said he is fed up with nuisance calls

‘A ban on these firms would help people know a call out of the blue is one not to be trusted.’

Last year Culture Secretary Maria Miller announced plans to lower the threshold of what is considered a nuisance call – meaning ‘annoying’ as well as ‘distressing’ calls are investigated.

Further measures are being drawn up to prevent cold callers being able to conceal their number and to improve the system for consumers to give their consent to be contacted.

From this weekend, telephone firm TalkTalk will become the first to make all landline privacy calling features completely free, allowing families to block nusiance calls.

TalkTalk CEO Dido Harding said: 'Nuisance and unwanted calls are a huge source of stress.

'It’s clear to see that customers are looking to their providers to do more to safeguard them against this menace.

'We agree and don't believe that people should be charged for the privilege of protecting their privacy. Our customers can now benefit from even more free features to help them avoid nuisance calls, helping to make TalkTalk homes even better off.'

The issue was be debated in the Commons today, with Lib Dem MP Mike Crockart demanding the government take action against firms who target vulnerable people.

Ahead of the debate, he said: ‘I am fed up with nuisance calls to my landline and mobile, as well as unsolicited texts.

‘And by nuisance calls I mean unwanted live marketing calls, as well as silent calls, abandoned calls, spam texts and recorded messages. I'm pestered day in, day out and I know I am not alone.’

The chairman of the all-party group on nuisance calls said he has been inundated by members of the public angry about the issue.

‘These are an annoyance for most people, but for many vulnerable and elderly people, they are also a menace, and one that puts them at risk of fraud just as much as though a crook or a pushy salesman turned up at their door.’

Culture minister Ed Vaizey said the Government was now going to bring forward legislation to make it easier for the Information Commissioner to fine rogue marketing firms which generate nuisance calls.

The minister said: 'It is important that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water - that we tackle the scourge of nuisance calls, whilst also recognising that next to that is a legitimate industry doing a legitimate job.

'Make no mistake, this Government... does recognise that this is a scourge, it is a scourge where we need to make an impact and it needs to be tackled.'

Last year research from Citizens Advice found 42 per cent of households received cold calls were about personal injury and accident claims, 40 per cent from gas and electricity companies, 29 per cent related to double glazing, 23 per cent debt relief services, 14 per cent for extended warranties on products and 10 per cent offering services to ‘unlock’ pensions.
