A couple who created their own children’s programmes because they were so appalled by ‘nonsense’ such as the Teletubbies have become an internet hit.

Jezz Wright, 44, and Julianne Martin, 35, were regularly having to switch off the television because they believed the shows on offer were ‘numbing’ their two young children’s brains.

The married couple believed popular programmes such as Power Rangers and In The Night Garden were just ‘virtual e-numbers’ that made children hyperactive – so they decided to make their own.

Family affair: Jez Wright and Julianne Martin were sick of their children Cillian and Beth watching nonsense TV so they created their own animation called Jack and Holly

Clever: Their own animations - with characters Jack and Holly - aim to educate children whilst watching instead of rotting their brains

They created a series of animated 
films based on characters called Jack and Holly, best friends who learn 
something of educational value through their adventures.

The stories are designed for pre-school children and can be downloaded via  the internet.

The 15-minute episodes can be viewed 
only once they are started by parents, meaning that children cannot just
 sit watching programme after programme as they could with television. 
Mr Wright and Miss Martin believe this gets youngsters to interact with 
their parents and discuss the show.

The couple are now receiving more than
 500,000 monthly hits worldwide on the animated tales, with interest 
particularly keen in the US, and experts reckon the venture could now 
become a multi-million-pound business with the right investment.

Rubbish: Shows like the Teletubbies are 'virtual e-numbers' according to the parents and offer nothing good for Britain's children

Mr Wright, a freelance media lecturer 
who lives in Norwich with his wife and their two children Cillian, 
eight, and Beth, five, said: ‘We’re delighted with the success we have 
had.

That was never the aim, so it has been a terrific bonus. We were 
just fed up with all the unnecessary nonsense children’s heads are 
filled with. We wanted to make something we felt happy about our son and
 daughter sitting down to watch.

‘When we were young, there would be a 
short spell after school when you could watch children’s TV. Now there 
are entire channels dedicated to it.

‘The massive problem with TV for 
pre-schoolers in the UK is that you are either sending them to la-la 
land with the Tele-tubbies, or making them hyper watching programmes 
like the Power Rangers.

‘TV effectively becomes virtual e-numbers for children with nothing remotely stimulating for them.’

Concerns: Cillian and Beth watch the box and they themselves contribute to the show created by their mum and dad

Happier: More than 500,000 people have watched their animations in a venture that could make them huge sums in the future

Housewife Miss Martin added: ‘Jack And
 Holly isn’t filling children’s heads with rubbish but it still captures
 the imagination enough for them to be entertained.

‘It harks back to old-school, 
traditional values in terms of children’s TV, fulfilling genuine 
educational material. At least that’s what we’ve aimed for.’

The creative couple were inspired to make the films when Cillian was four and began asking questions about Christmas.

They looked for programmes to help explain but found nothing suitable.

Instead they designed Jack And Holly’s
 Christmas Countdown, a 70-minute animated film about the friends 
discovering the true meaning of Christmas. It proved so popular with 
their children and friends’ children that they decided to continue.

Pair: Cillian and Beth say they love the Jack and Holly characters and learn a lot more from them

Mr Wright produces and writes each 
episode, Cillian performs the voice of Jack and Miss Martin performs the
 voice of Holly. Family friend Graham Jones draws the  animations, which
 have been expanded to a whole series of stories. Last month, Mr Wright 
and Miss Martin launched their own online channel, allowing anyone with a
 Roku TV Box or a smart TV to stream their programmes via the internet, 
like BBC iPlayer.

The programmes can currently be 
downloaded for free but the couple also sell DVDs via their website,  
www.jackandholly.com. They set up the enterprise on a ‘shoestring 
budget’ and currently operate on a not-for-profit basis, donating their 
small profits to children’s hospices across the UK.

But business development experts have 
told them their creation has the potential to make them millionaires. Mr
 Wright said: ‘With the right investment we certainly believe the 
business could potentially be worth more than £500,000 within just a 
year or so. From there who knows? We’ve been told the sky’s the limit.

‘The response has been so terrific – 
it shows parents are looking for quality programming for their children.
 And at least we finally have something for our two to watch.’
