South Yorkshire Police and Crime commissioner Shaun Wright has received the threats in the wake of the damning report into child sex abuse in Rotherham

The police chief who has refused to step down from his £85,000-a-year post in the wake of the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal has started to receive death threats, the force has claimed.

South Yorkshire Police and Crime commissioner Shaun Wright, who has faced calls from the Prime Minister to resign from his taxpayer-funded post, has allegedly been targeted after it was revealed that 1,400 children were sexually exploited over a 16-year period in the town.

It follows accusations he and several other senior officials failed to protect the victims from the systemic abuse. 

Mr Wright, who was the councillor responsible for children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, said the revelations were a 'huge surprise' to him.

But it was revealed last week that in his post as cabinet member for children’s services in Rotherham, he must have been aware social services were dealing with hundreds of children at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. 

As a result, senior politicians including David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Theresa May have said the crime tsar should step down.

However he is still clinging onto his taxpayer-funded job, despite a vote of no confidence by Sheffield City Council last week and protesters turning up at his office daily. 

South Yorkshire Police confirmed it has reviewed the safety of several people since the report's publication to ensure 'proportionate safety measures' are in place - but the force refused to confirm whether protection has been stepped up around Mr Wright.

In a statement, the crime commissioner's office said: 'We welcome feedback from all citizens and we strongly advocate the right of the public to participate in democracy through legitimate means, such as peaceful public protest. There is however a line in law that cannot not be crossed.

'Where threats are made to any individual, the individual has a right to protection and the level of protection provided in such cases is a matter for operational policing.' 

A South Yorkshire Police statement said: 'The publication of the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham has led to a number of people wishing to express views against those featured in the report.

'South Yorkshire Police has carried out risk assessments for a number of people and locations and our aim is to ensure proportionate safety measures are in place. This is regularly reviewed.

'We will respond to any specific incidents appropriately, balanced against the right to peaceful protest and in line with legislation.'  

Ed Miliband is one of the many senior politicians who have called for Mr Wright to step down after the scale of abuse in the South Yorkshire town was unveiled

Mr Wright's deputy Tracey Cheetham had been under little public pressure to go. However, the mother-of-three decided she could no longer carry on amid the outrage over Mr Wright’s defiant stand. 

When she stepped down, she said: ‘It is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and, with this in mind, I believe it would have been the right thing for Shaun Wright to resign.  

One Rotherham victim, who was abused at 14 by an older man, told the Mail that Mr Wright ‘should be ashamed of himself’.

Jessica, now 29, said: ‘The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward. He needs to accept his part in it and quit.’ 

Mr Wright, who was a member of the Labour party until he quit on Wednesday and has met Ed Miliband, cannot be sacked by the police or by politicians because he was elected by the public in 2012. 

Last week ,Sheffield City Council passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in Mr Wright after Labour members joined a Lib Dem call for him to go.

Mr Wright was Labour's candidate for PCC, but the party have retracted their support for him in the wake of the scandal. 

When Labour threatened to throw him out following the publication of the report, Mr Wright reacted by resigning from the party.

Mr Wright issued a statement before last week's Sheffield vote, which said: 'The findings of Prof Jay's report are not about one person or one organisation.

'These findings are about taking a multi-agency approach to dealing with bringing the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice.

'I've had many messages of support, many of which are from partners, encouraging me to remain and to continue my work on prioritising and tackling the extremely important issue of child sexual exploitation (CSE). I'm sure that all partners involved in tackling this issue will work with me to do just that for the sake of past victims and for the sake of safeguarding potential future victims.' 

South Yorkshire Police have 'reviewed the safety of several people' in the wake of the damning report which revealed the scale of abuse. Last week members of the EDL held a demonstration outside the police station
