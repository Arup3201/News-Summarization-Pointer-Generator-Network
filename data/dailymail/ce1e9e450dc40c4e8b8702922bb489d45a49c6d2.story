Admission: Nick Clegg revealed he has stopped wearing shoes in his office

It is common in politics for the gloves to come off – but normally during bruising encounters in the Commons.

For the Deputy Prime Minister, it is the shoes and socks that come off.

Nick Clegg has taken a decidedly lax approach to office attire as the country sizzles in a summer heatwave and has started walking around his office barefoot.

The Lib Dem leader gave a glimpse into his working habits yesterday, while pointing out that he respects the ‘dignity’ of his ministerial staff by always wearing footwear for public events.

He told listeners on London’s LBC radio: ‘I was padding around in my office without my shoes on yesterday, but obviously in public events when I have to respect the dignity of the office I put my shoes back on.’

Mr Clegg, 46, said he also allows staff to cool off by wearing shorts – as long as they are ‘not in public facing jobs where they have to keep up appearances’.

Teo van den Broeke, of men’s magazine Esquire, said of Mr Clegg’s barefoot style: ‘I think it’s incredibly poor etiquette and sets too lax a tone.’

Broeke advised wearing thinner soles and more breathable shoes as a way to beat the heat, but never flip-flops.

Mr Clegg went on to divulge how his laid-back approach to work clothes also extending to staff being allowed to wear shorts.

He said: ‘I am perfectly relaxed about people who work in my office, as 
long as they are not in public facing jobs where they have to keep up 
appearances, if they are in the office working hard I’m very keen that 
they shouldn’t overheat.’

The Met Office this morning issued a 
'level three' heatwave warning for London and the South East for the 
second day running but also added the South West England and the West 
Midlands regions on to the high alert list.

Temperatures reached highs of 30.5C 
by the Solent in Hampshire by 1pm today with forecasters warning it 
could get even hotter by the end of the day.

A group of Labour MPs have tabled a 
parliamentary motion saying that workers should be allowed to down tools
when the temperature hits 30C (86F) or 27C (81F) if they do strenuous 
work.

On Wednesday a group of Labour MPs tabled an Early Day Motion in the 
Commons that called for workers to be sent home when the temperature 
reaches 30C indoors.

But Mr Clegg said: ‘I don’t think we should suddenly be passing laws and issuing great rules for everybody.

Mr Clegg said commuters faced ‘brutal’ temperatures on public transport, but did not think the law needed to be changed.

‘I just think you’ve got to be pragmatic, if you’re in an office which doesn’t have air conditioning and the sun is coming in, particularly these offices under roofs which can overheat, I just think you’ve got to be sensible. 

‘You cannot, I don’t think, reasonably expect someone to actually sit in an office if it’s 35 degrees, you can’t get work done like that.’

The prospect of Mr Clegg tip-toing around his office in his socks drew immediate comparisons with former Tory policy guru Steve Hilton.

He left Downing Street staff baffled by his appearance, rarely wearing shoes, but often sporting shorts and a Big Society t-shirt.
