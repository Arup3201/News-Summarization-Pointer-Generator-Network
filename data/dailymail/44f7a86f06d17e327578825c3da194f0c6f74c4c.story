Australia made it a clean sweep in the 100m freestyle final on Monday morning, claiming gold, silver and bronze in a dominant display in the pool.

James Magnussen edged out Cam McEvoy to be crowned Commonwealth champion.

Tommaso D'Orsogna took bronze.

In another golden display, Michael Shelley won the men's 26.2-mile marathon on day four of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The marathoner won a silver medal in the marathon at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in India.

The 30-year-old secured the title with an impressive time of 2:11.15, beating Kenya's defending champion John Ekiru Kelai.

'It is starting to sink in now,' Shelley said. 'I dug deep and I was hoping I wouldn't blow-up like I have done in the past.'

'It was still head down [despite building a 100-metre lead], don't think about it too much because anything could happen.

'I was a bit like "urgh, keep going, keep going, keep digging, keep digging". I kept focused to finish off as strong as possible.'

Australian Jess Trengrove won the bronze medal by finishing third in the women's marathon.

Jodi Elkington, 21, won the women's long jump on Sunday.

Australia has gone top of the medal tally at the Commonwealth Games, overtaking England in with a tally of 20 golds, one more than England, 14 silver and 22 bronze.

It was little-known 19-year-old Taylor McKeown who stole the show on another impressive day for our athletes claiming gold in an emotionally charged 200m breaststroke final over Australian teammate Sally Hunter.

McKeown was one of 16 Australian rookies making their senior team debut in Glasgow, but blitzed her more experienced rivals in a time of 2:22.36 - close to a second faster than Hunter in second place.

She, along with Australia's Emily Seebhom, were Australia's best in the drink on day three while the Campbell sisters enjoyed a podium moment together in the 50m freestyle  albeit for the minor placings.

Seebhom set a new Commonwealth Games record of 59:37sec in retaining her 100m backstroke Commonwealth title in Glasgow.

Australia is on equal terms with England in first place with 17 golds each, but its huge share of bronze has edged England narrowly on total medals won (50)  by five.

Brisbane’s Grant Irvine threatened one of the big upsets of the Games when leading South African champ Chad Le Clos at the 150m mark of 200m butterfly final only to be hauled in by the Olympic gold medalist in the final 25m.

Other home grown highlights from day three include a gold to Australia's 4x200m women's relay team. Emma McKeon, Alicia Coutts, Brittany Elmslie and Bronte Barratt brought finished first over Canada, which edged out England for silver. 

Daniel Fox also earned an Australian gold in in the para-sport 200m freestyle. Fox swum a time of 1:57.89, narrowly missing his own world record from the heats.

His gold medal moment was equaled by cyclist Annette Edmondson in the women's 10km scratch race - the event which put Australia on equal terms with England.

Her gold, and Australia's second on day three, came after Daniel Repacholi clenched first place in the men's 10m air pistol event.

Edmondson and Repacholi's wins also stretched Australia's lead further on host nation Scotland who trail in third place with 11 gold.

Cyclist Amy Cure took home a silver in the same event won by Edmondson.

Earlier on day two Gold Coast swimmers Thomas Fraser-Holmes and Leiston Pickett put on a swimming masterclass early on Saturday morning - day two of the games - leading Australia's gold medal rush in the pool with victories in the 200m freestyle and 50m backstroke respectively.

Their efforts were matched by Maddison Elliott, who earlier won the para-sport 100m freestyle event, and the men's 4x100m freestyle relay team who claimed bragging rights with a Commonwealth Games record beating time.

The men's team of James Magnussen, Cameron McEvoy, Tommaso D’Orsogna and Matt Abood had to fight back after a strong first leg by Chad le Clos but managed to claim the gold in a Commonwealth Games freestyle record - winning in a time of 3min 13:44sec.

Before Australia took to the pool it was 27-year-old Laura Coles pulling off a surprise upset winning the skeet final in shooting. She staved off Welsh woman  Elena Allen in a closely matched shoot-out which went down to the wire.

Coles won by just a single shot.

Jack Bobridge then won gold in the 4000m individual pursuit, beating compatriot Alex Edmondson, who claimed silver in an all-Australian final.

More success on the cycling track also saw Kieran Modra and Jason Niblett take home silver in the men's 1000m para-cycling, just falling short of the home side by 0.15 seconds.

Another silver came from Annette Edmondson - Alex's sister - who lost out to England's Joanna Roswell, in the women's 3000m individual pursuit.

Meanwhile Edmondson's team mate Amy Cure took out third place in the same event.

These second-day triumphs come after a flying start for Australia's Commonwealth Games campaign, winning five gold medals on the first day of action.

Last night's gold haul moves Australia to outright second on the tally list with 13 golds, 10 silver and 14 bronze.

Scotland is third with seven gold medals, and Canada behind it with seven.
