A teenager is in an induced coma after he was punched to the ground when a party spilled out of control.

Police were called to a party in Bayswater in east Melbourne on Saturday night after a group of gate-crashers attended the party and fights broke out.

By the time police arrive the party had spilled out onto the street and approximately 100 party-goers and other youths were involved in fights on the street.

Jaiden, 15, is in an induced coma after he was punched and struck his head when a Melbourne party spun out of control

A witness told police a 15-year-old boy, Jaiden, who at the request of his family is known only by his first name, was walking away from the crowd along the footpath when he was punched by a youth running past him.

Jaiden, from Carrum Downs in Melbourne's southeast, was knocked to the ground by the blow and struck his head on the footpath.

The party which was held in a community hall, was advertised on social media and it's believed gate crashers turned up to the event.

Police say there were a number of fights inside the hall that spilled onto the street. Officers broke up the fights but some of the crowd returned and continued fighting.

Detective Rick Rittinger from Knox CIU said Jaiden was hit without warning.

'It was a case of the offender running past and stopping the victim and continuing running. There was no altercation, nothing said,' he said.

Jaiden fell to the ground and hit his head on the footpath.

He called his mother, Karen, to pick him up from the party but once in the car, the Carrum Downs teenager began having seizures and she rushed him to a nearby hospital.

He was transferred to the Royal Children's Hospital and placed in an induced coma.

The Rowville Secondary College student remains in the coma with bleeding on the brain.

Police were called to a party, which had spilled out onto the street on Saturday night 

Jaiden was treated by paramedics at the scene and collected by his mother, but his condition deteriorated as she drove him home and she took him to the hospital

His mother told of how Jaiden was an athlete with a placid personality who never would have provoked such an attack.

'My son who had the world at his feet now has a long road to go to get back to where he was,' she said at the Royal Children's Hospital. 

'Young people need to know this is not on. People are getting hurt for nothing.'

Jaiden was due to head to Italy in September for a trial to play soccer professionally, in the Italian Soccer Management Schools program. It offers advanced training from professional coaching staff to promising young players from across the world, reported Nine News.

He had also been pursuing local options through his school, Flinders Christian Community College as well as playing with the Bentleigh Greens Soccer Club’s junior side. The Greens are a semi-professional side based in Cheltenham that play in the National Premier Leagues Victoria. 

'He absolutely had not only the ability but the desire,' said his mother. 

Jaiden's brother Anthony also told Nine News ' he's the nicest kid you could meet in the world', while his family made a plea for the attacker to come forward.

'Be honest, please. You might not realise that the outcome of your action is what it is,' his mother said.

Police are looking for a male with blue jeans, a hoodie and possibly blonde hair, aged in his late-teens to early 20s.

The incident comes just days after the Victorian government announced it would introduce mandatory 10-year jail terms for perpetrators of one-punch attacks which result in a death.

Police are yet to speak to the victim but are appealing for anyone who may have information about the incident to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or via www.crimestoppers.com.au.
