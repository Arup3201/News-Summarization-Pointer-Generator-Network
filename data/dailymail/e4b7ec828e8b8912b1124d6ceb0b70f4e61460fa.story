Manchester United defender Rafael has returned home early from the club's tour of the United States to have treatment on a groin problem.

The 24-year-old sustained the injury in training prior to the Red Devils' win over Roma in Denver on Friday.

Even though there are three matches still remaining in America the Brazilian will not be fit in time to play in any, so the decision was made to send him back to England.

'As he was unlikely to participate in the remaining tour games, returning to the Aon Training Complex affords the best overall option for his recovery in time to continue pre-season preparation when the team returns,' said a statement on manutd.com.

United's Premier League opener at home to Swansea is just 19 days away on August 16.
