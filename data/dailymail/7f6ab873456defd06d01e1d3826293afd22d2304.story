Tennessee prosecutors have made sterilization of women part of plea negotiations so many times in the past five years that the district attorney has banned his staff from offering that as an option. 

Prosecutors in Nashville have used the invasive surgery as a bargaining chip at least four times in the past five years.

Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk, a former defense attorney who took over the office in September, has ordered lawyers in his office not to seek sterilization by defendants.

Nashville prosecutors have made sterilization of women part of plea negotiations at least four times in the past five years, leading Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk to ban his office from offering that option

Funk said he hadn't heard of it happening before but didn't ask, according to the Tennessean.

He said: 'I have let my office know that that is not an appropriate condition of a plea.

'It is now policy that sterilization will never be a condition of deal-making in the district attorney's office.

'The bottom line is the government can't be ordering a forced sterilization.'

Funk said people could be ordered to stay away from children and the state wouldn't have to resort to such invasive measures. 

In the most recent case, a woman with a 20-year history of mental illness had been charged with neglect after her five-day-old baby mysteriously died. 

Her defense attorney said the prosecutor assigned to the case wouldn't go forward with a plea deal to keep the woman out of prison unless she had the surgery.

Defense attorneys say there have been at least three similar cases in the past five years.

That figure suggests the practice may not be as rare as people think and may happen more often outside the public view and without the blessing of a court.

However, such deals do happen.

224,000 adults experienced serious mental illness in 2012-13.

47,000 children ages 12 to 17 had one major depressive episode in 2012-13.

103,892 adults in Davidson County with mental illness from 2010-12.

Nearly 20 per cent of the about 1,700 jail inmates have a mental health issue, according to the Davidson County's Sheriff's Office.

In West Virginia, a 21-year-old unmarried mother of three agreed to have her tubes tied in 2009 as part of her probation after she pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute marijuana.

And last year, a Virginia man who fathered children with several women agreed to undergo a vasectomy in exchange for less prison time in a child endangerment case.

Forced sterilization came up in a different way in California last year, when Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that banned state prisons from forcing female inmates to be sterilized. 

The law was pushed through after the Center for Investigative Reporting found that nearly 150 female prisoners had been sterilized between 2006 and 2010. 

An audit found that the state failed to make sure the inmate's consent was lawfully obtained in every case.

The most recent Nashville case involved Jasmine Randers, 36, who had been under court supervision for mental illness when she left her home state of Minnesota. 

She gave birth in West Memphis, Arkansas, then fled a homeless shelter to come to Nashville, said her attorney, assistant public defender Mary-Kathryn Harcombe.

Court records show Randers reported awakening in a motel, where she'd slept in a bed with the baby, only to find the child unresponsive. 

She reportedly called a taxi two hours later and took the child to a local hospital, where the infant was pronounced dead.

There was no sign of injury, and the cause of death was undetermined.

Police later learned that in 2004, Randers stabbed herself in the stomach while pregnant, though the fetus was not harmed. 

She told investigators that it happened when she fell down the stairs while cutting fruit.

The assistant district attorney who worked the case, Brian Holmgren, was once a senior attorney with the National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse and serves on the international advisory board of the National Center for Shaken Baby Syndrome. 

He has been both praised and fiercely criticized for his aggressive courtroom tactics on behalf of children.

When Holmgren insisted Randers undergo sterilization to avoid prison, Harcombe complained. 

The district attorney took over the case, and Randers was not sterilized. 

The prosecutor agreed Randers was mentally ill and she was institutionalized after being found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Harcombe said: 'Any time a woman is given a choice between prison and this surgery, that is inherently coercive, even in cases where there is no mental illness.'

Jasmine Randers, who has a history of mental illness, was charged with neglect after her five-day-old baby died. Her defense attorney said the prosecutor wouldn't go forward with a plea deal unless she was sterilized

Harcombe said Holmgren previously asked that another client agree to be sterilized in order to get a plea deal. 

She refused and it didn't become part of the plea deal reached in that case. 

Nashville defense attorney Carrie Searcy said Holmgren asked that two of her clients who gave birth to children who tested positive for drugs undergo sterilization.

Neither did, Searcy said, because both women had already undergone the procedure.

Assistant public defender Joan Lawson said she also had been involved in cases in which a prosecutor had put sterilization on the table. 

She said she refused the idea and resolved her cases without sterilization. 

The attorney said: 'It's always been more of 'If your client is willing to do this, then I might be inclined to talk about probation.'

Lawson said it was typically not an explicit demand, was not an everyday occurrence and was made off the record.  

Sterilization coerced by the legal system evokes a dark time in America, when minorities, the poor and those deemed mentally unfit or 'deficient' were forced to undergo medical procedures that prevented them from having children.

Paul Lombardo, a law professor and historian who teaches at Georgia State University, said: 'The history of sterilization in this country is that it is applied to the most despised people - criminals and the people we're most afraid of, the mentally ill - and the one thing that that these two groups usually share is that they are the most poor. 

'That is what we've done in the past, and that's a good reason not to do it now.'
