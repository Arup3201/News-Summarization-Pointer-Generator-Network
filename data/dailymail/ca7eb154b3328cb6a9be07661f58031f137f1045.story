Racist attacks: Theo Walcott's family won't travel to the Ukraine this summer to watch him in action because they fear being subjected to violence

Theo Walcott's family will stay away from Euro 2012 next month because they fear being subjected to vile racist taunts at the tournament.

The footballer's brother Ashley revealed the family believe it isn't 'worth risking' travelling to Ukraine to watch England play.

Walcott, 23, was yesterday named in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for the tournament.

The Arsenal star was subjected to dreadful monkey taunts along with England's other black players by Bulgarian fans during a previous away game in Eastern Europe last September.

Theo's father Don and his brother Ashley, who is a chef, have watched him in action across the world.

But yesterday Ashley took to Twitter to say they would be staying away from Ukraine this summer.

He wrote: 'Unfortunately my dad n i have taken the decision not to travel to the Ukraine because of the fear of possible racist attacks confrontations (sic).

'Something's aren't worth risking, but begs the question why hold a competition of this magnitude in a place that can not police itself for foreigners of any creed to feel safe, but I'll be watching every minute.'

He added: 'Racism has no place in the modern world.'

England face France, Sweden and co-hosts Ukraine in the tournament which kicks off next month.

They could also face matches in Poland if they get through to the latter stages of the competition.

Ukrainian extremists have warned black and Asian England fans not to travel back to the tournament.

England boss Roy Hodgson warned yesterday that supporters risk being targeted by right-wing extremists.

'There's no doubt that the issue of racism... hooliganism and violence in Ukraine is obviously a concern for us all - not least the supporters who go over there and risk maybe getting beaten up, or if they don't happen to be white, subjected to a lot of abuse.'

Theo Walcott became the youngest ever England player in May 2006 at the age of 17.

Kevin Miles, from the Football Supporter's Federation, said today that racism is an 'endemic social problem' in the Ukraine.

'Racism has no place in football but it is a social problem in Ukraine,' he said.

'The Foreign Office advice in normal circumstances to citizens of black or Asian heritage is to exercise caution and we reiterate that.

'We are talking about racism as an endemic social problem. There is no question that UEFA (the tournament organisers) takes this issue very seriously and stewards inside grounds are being trained to deal with it.

'What's more difficult to deal with is away from the football stadium.'

The supporters' group have put together a free guide on their website offering advice to fans travelling to the tournament.

He added: 'Our advice to fans is is to exercise common sense - stay together and don't wonder too far off the beaten track.

'In city centres and in fan zones it should not be an issue. It is when you go beyond that use common sense and stay together.'
