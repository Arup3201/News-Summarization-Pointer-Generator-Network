David Cameron insisted he retains pride in the British Empire after visiting the site of what he called its most ‘monstrous’ atrocity today.

The Prime Minister echoed the words of Winston Churchill as he paid tribute to the 379 innocent Indians slaughtered in the Amritsar massacre.

Mr Cameron concluded his visit to India yesterday with a trip to the Golden Temple, the holiest site for Sikhs, and the Jallianwala Bagh gardens – where soldiers under Brigadier Reginald Dyer fired 1,650 shots into a crowd of 20,000 unarmed protesters in 1919.

Mr Cameron called the killings ‘deeply shameful’ but stopped short of giving an explicit apology for the massacre.

 think there’s an enormous amount to be proud of in what the British 
Empire did and was responsible for.

‘But of course there were bad events as well as good ones.

‘The bad events we should learn from and the good events we should celebrate.’

He called Britain’s imperial rule in 
India a ‘net help’ for the UK forging new links with one of the world’s 
fastest growing economies because of the ‘shared history and culture’.

Mr Cameron was shown around the 
massacre site, including a well down which people threw themselves to 
their deaths as they sought to avoid the gunfire, and a wall studded 
with 28 bullet holes.

He then laid a wreath at the memorial to the dead before inscribing the book of condolence.

He wrote: ‘This was a deeply shameful
 event in British history, one that Winston Churchill rightly described 
at the time as “monstrous”.

‘We must never forget what happened 
here and in remembering we must ensure that the United Kingdom stands up
 for the right to peaceful protest around the world.’

Memorial site secretary Sukumar 
Mukherjee, whose grandfather survived the massacre, said: ‘He has come 
here, he has paid his tributes. It is more than an apology.’

But Sunil Kapoor, president of the 
Jallianwala Bagh Freedom Fighters Foundation and whose great-grandfather
 Wasoo Mal Kapoor was killed in the massacre, said he was ‘not 
satisfied’ that Mr Cameron did not meet relatives of those who died.

Explaining why he had not apologised,
 Mr Cameron said: ‘We’re dealing with something here that happened a 
good 40 years before I was even born.

‘I don’t think the right thing is to reach back into history and seek out things to apologise for.

‘The right thing is to acknowledge what happened, to recall what happened, to show respect and understanding.’

Remorse: Mr Cameron was the first sitting prime minister ever to visit Amritsar

Gunned: The Amritsar massacre, in which British soldiers gunned down at least 379 peaceful protesters in 1919, as depicted in the 1982 film Gandhi

Sparked movement: The massacre is seen as the low point of the Raj and one of the reasons Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent protest movement gathered support

Mr Cameron also said he would not 
hand back the Koh-i-Noor diamond, claimed by India, saying it would not 
be ‘the right approach’.

The visit to Amritsar – the first by a
 sitting prime minister – was also an attempt to drum up votes from 
Britain’s 800,000-strong Sikh community.

Before visiting the massacre site, Mr Cameron toured the Golden temple.

  The
 Amritsar massacre is considered one of the low points in the history of
 the Empire - and it also helped to end British rule in India.

Tens
 of thousands of Indians gathered in a square near the city's iconic 
Golden Temple on April 13, 1919 and started protesting against the power
 of the Raj.

The 
protest was part of the growing independence movement, with strikes and 
demonstrations sweeping the country in the preceding months.

It
 was this revolutionary background which made Bridgadier-General 
Reginald Dyer nervous about the protest, and which motivated his 
decision to order dozens of soldiers to open fire on the demonstrators.

The
 troops, most of whom were themselves Indian, fired indiscriminately and
 without warning, killing hundreds - the official death toll was 379, 
but Indians claim that around 1,000 protesters died.

Dyer
 had intended to suppress calls for independence, but instead the 
massacre ended up boosting them as previously pacific Indians rallied to
 the cause after hearing of the horrific slaughter.

Reactions
 in Britain were mixed, but many - including Winston Churchill, then 
Secretary of State for War - were revolted by the killing.

One
 man particularly inspired by the news was Mahatma Gandhi, who soon 
began a campaign of non-violence protest which would eventually lead to 
the country's independence in 1947.

He removed his shoes and socks and put on a blue bandana for his tour.

He was shown the kitchens, which feed many of the 100,000 pilgrims who visit the temple every day.

He posed for pictures with temple 
officials and tried his hand flipping chapatis, before visiting the 
inner sanctum in the temple complex.

He described it as ‘very moving, very serene and very spiritual’.

‘In coming here to Amritsar, we 
should also celebrate the immense contribution that people from the 
Punjab play in Britain, the role they play, what they give to our 
country,’ Mr Cameron added.
