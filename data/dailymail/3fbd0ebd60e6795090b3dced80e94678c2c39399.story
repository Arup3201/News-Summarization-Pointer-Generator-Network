A knifeman is facing jail after stabbing another man with such force that the the weapon got stuck nearly three inches in his skull.

James Johnson, 21, spent 10 days in a coma, had to undergo lifesaving surgery and has a metal plate in his skull after the brutal attack in Harwich, Essex, by Kyle Ogilvie, 22.

Ogilvie was today told at Chelmsford Crown Court that he faces a lengthy prison sentence after being found guilty of attempted murder.

The jury heard the Ogilvie had bragged of the attack after a party in Harwich, Essex, and told a group of women: 'That guy, that's hurt. I just stuck a knife in the side of his head.'

Ogilvie, from Harwich, showed no emotion as the unanimous guilty verdict was read out by the jury after eight hours deliberation.

Judge Charles Gratwicke, remanded Ogilvie in custody telling him: 'Prepare yourself for a lengthy prison sentence.'

After the verdicts Mr Johnson's mother, June Rawlinson, praised the community for coming forward to help 
convict the attempted murderer.

Mrs Rawlinson, James's adoptive mother, said: 'I am over the moon. In May Kyle 
tried to take my son's life but on Thursday the jury took his.

'I was sitting in court on Wednesday for the closing statements reading 
what the judge was reading and I had a little thing in the back of my 
mind that Kyle might not be found guilty.

'But
everyone has been so supportive to keep me going, I am taken aback. 
James seems over the moon. I don't think it has sunk in for him yet 
though.'

The court heard that Ogilvie struck on Mill Lane, Harwich on May 6, lashing out with such force that that blade penetrated Mr Johnson's head by almost three inches.

It took a delicate operation to remove the knife and Mr Johnson was in a coma for ten days but made a miraculous recovery.

Ogilvie denied trying to kill Mr Johnson but refused to go into the witness box during his trial.

But he was convicted after the three week trial heard how he bragged about what he had done to friends and others at the scene.

Ogilvie had been thrown out of a house in Mill Lane, Harwich after he got involved in a fight with another man and had picked up a kitchen knife before he left.

At the same time Mr Johnson was one his way home after watching DVD at his adoptive parents' house when Ogilvie attacked him.

Witnesses saw Mr Johnson staggering around with the knife sticking out of his head.

As he walked off, Ogilvie was heard telling a group of women: 'It's okay girls, I'm not going to hurt you. That guy, that's hurt. I just stuck a knife in the side of his head.'

He made a panicked early morning phone call to a friend the next day and said he had stabbed someone but did not mean it.

He was interviewed at least five times by police probing the incident but declined to answer questions. 

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Parkes said: 'Just carrying a weapon is idiotic. 
Taking one to a fight is pure madness.

'Ogilvie said that he had consumed
so much alcohol he cannot remember the incident. The drink and the 
knife made a toxic combination. 

'The speed with which he was 
arrested, with the assistance from the local community, means he will 
now be imprisoned for some time to reflect on his actions.'

Gareth Hughes, defending, blamed another man for the attack, but the jury rejected the excuses.

Mrs Rawlinson, who lives in Harwich, travelled to the court twice to hear evidence and closing statements during the trial.

She said: 'It was choking hearing what I heard in court, witnesses saying what Kyle had said to them afterwards.

'The community raised up to speak out. It shows people have consciences and they did the right thing and came forward. 

'It could have been anyone's brother, uncle or son but it happened to be my boy.'

She said she is looking forward to a quiet family Christmas and she said she was thankful her family could be together.
