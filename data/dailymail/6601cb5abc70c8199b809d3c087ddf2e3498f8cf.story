Plastic mini-me dolls manufactured to resemble iconic characters from film and TV invariably look nothing like the iconic characters from film and TV.

At least, not until Noel Cruz has taken his paintbrush to them, that is.

The portrait artist - known in the doll community as a 'repaint artist' - is known for his ability to turn even the most basic Mattel or Hasbro figurine into an incredibly realistic version of the celebrity on which it is modelled.

Featured in Cruz's catalogue are 
Twilight stars Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, as well as vampires 
Laurent, James and Victoria; Angelina Jolie; Johnny Depp as Captain Jack
Sparrow in Pirates Of The Caribbean; and Steve Carell, star of the 
American version of The Office.

His dolls typically fetch between $500 (£314) and $3,500 (£2,200) via internet auction, with his Angelina Jolie doll selling for $4,300 (£2,704).

He has also taken his intricate 
paintwork to dolls of Cher, Harry Potter and Orlando Bloom, as well as Anne 
Hathaway and Meryl Streep's characters from The Devil Wears Prada.
