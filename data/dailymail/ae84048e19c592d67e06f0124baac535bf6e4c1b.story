Louis van Gaal's side are rumoured to have firmed up their interest since the World Cup due to reports the 27-year-old is uncertain of his future in Italy.

Speaking shortly after the summer tournament, Cuadrado said: 'I don’t know yet what will happen.

'At this moment I haven’t received any concrete offers from any club.

There's no signal as to whether Barcelona would match any potential offer from United, but Luis Enrique is a long-term admirer of Cuadrado, so could fight United all the way for his signature.

Enrique views Caudrado's versatility as something which could really benefit his team this season, as they look to get back on the trophy haul after a season to forget.

Elsewhere, the Catalan giants have been boosted with the recent news that Xavi will be staying at the club along with the arrival of Jeremy Mathieu at the Nou Camp.
