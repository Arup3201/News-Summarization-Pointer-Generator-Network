Perhaps it was the win over Swansea on Saturday but Manchester United's star man Wayne Rooney raised a smile as he was pictured taking a break during his warm-weather training in Egypt.

The England striker was sent to the hot African climate to speed up his recovery from a groin problem, resting him from the weekend Barclays Premier League victory at Old Trafford.

And United manager David Moyes will be hoping his plan will have paid off with a trip to championship contenders Chelsea on Sunday.

The Scot looks almost certain to be without Robin van Persie at Stamford Bridge, with the Dutchman's return date from a thigh problem that has kept him out for a month presently unknown.

Rooney, who is joined in Egypt with a club fitness coach, happily posed for a picture with fans at his hotel and United will hope he has responded well to his training and have back Manchester this week. He hasn't played since the New Year's Day defeat by Tottenham.

Normally, a trip to Stamford Bridge would not be an occasion to relish.

However, having won there last year and 
with present expectations so low, it might turn out to be the best test 
United could be presented with.

'We will be all right,' said midfielder Darren Fletcher.

'Sometimes in bigger games you really come together. It brings out your best performances because you are really focused and really intent on proving people wrong.

'Going to Chelsea is a great challenge.

'We can take some confidence from beating Swansea and are fully confident of going down there and getting more of the same.'
