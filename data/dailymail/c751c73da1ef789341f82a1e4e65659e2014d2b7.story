Troubled club: Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston (above) described a fan  as an ‘intellectual cripple’

A Championship football club chairman has called a supporter a ‘retard’ and ‘f***tard’ in a series of foul-mouthed text messages.

Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston described fan Steve Smith as an ‘intellectual cripple’ after the supporter had texted him with some questions about the side who are bottom of the league.

Mr Oyston, 47, shockingly referred to father-of-three Mr Smith, 31, and other angry fans of the club - who lost 6-1 at home to Bournemouth yesterday - as ‘lower mentality types’.

According to a report in The Sun on Sunday by journalist Paul Keaveny, the chairman said: ‘Are you sure we have met? I would have remembered such a massive retard.’

During a text exchange with Mr Smith, in which the fan was also said to have made insults, Mr Oyston added: ‘Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f***tard as you.’

He went on to tell business manager Mr Smith: ‘Sorry that your life is so s***, but that's only your fault not mine. Enjoy the rest of your special needs day out.’

Mr Smith said Mr Oyston had banned him from the club’s Bloomfield Road ground, telling The Sun on Sunday: ‘As a chairman you should be able to rise above what a fan thinks and respond in a polite manner.’

Ismail Kaji, who has a learning disability and works for the charity Mencap, said that the ‘disgusting’ language made him ‘sick’ - and was ‘just as bad as using racist or homophobic words’.

He told MailOnline today: ‘A lot of people with a learning disability, like me, are passionate football supporters. I would feel ashamed however to support any football club that has a chairman who uses such disgusting language to people with a disability.

‘This language is just as bad as using racist or homophobic words. There is no difference and it makes me sick. Someone with a high profile should act as a role model, not needlessly insult the people that look up to them.

‘Regardless of his position though, what he said should not be tolerated. The chairman must apologise to the people who will have been deeply affected by the language aimed at them. This cannot be ignored.’

Mr Oyston - whose family is worth £100million, putting them in 863rd position in the latest Sunday Times Rich List - is the son of businessman and convicted rapist Owen, 80.

Revelations of the messages come after Wigan Athletic's chairman accepted a Football Association misconduct charge last week for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities.

Dave Whelan allegedly used the words in trying to justify his managerial appointment of Malky Mackay, who remains the subject of an FA probe into racist, homophobic and sexist messages.

The 78-year-old was quoted as saying ‘Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else’ while also arguing there was ‘nothing’ offensive about the term ‘chink’.

But, following the comments, Mr Oyston said of Mr Whelan: ‘He says things as he sees them and is from a different generation but he’s certainly not a racist.’ 

Blackpool manager Lee Clark is the Seasiders' fourth manager this calendar year, with the Fylde coast club - who were in the Premier League as recently as 2011 - having won just twice all season.

A spokesman for Blackpool did not immediately return a request for comment today, while the FA told MailOnline that it was 'aware of the story'.
