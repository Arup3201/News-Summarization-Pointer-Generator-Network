'Motorists must give the road their full attention as a few seconds’ lapse in concentration can have catastrophic consequences, literally meaning the difference between life and death.' 

The comedian, has performed more than 20 stand-up shows

He was found not guilty of assault. 

In recent weeks he revealed he would include the death of Hollywood comedian Robin Williams in his new show. 

Giving an interview with Vibe, Brown said: 'I’ve just written down, "knock, knock", the audience are going to say "who’s there".

'I’m going to say "Robin Williams: I'm not dead yet, will you open this f*****g box."

'As daft as it is, people will laugh at it. I know what they’ll laugh at and I know what they won’t laugh at.'
