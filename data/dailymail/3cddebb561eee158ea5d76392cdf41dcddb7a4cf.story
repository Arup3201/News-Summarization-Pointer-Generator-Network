Armed to the teeth: George Zimmerman has enough guns to power a one man army

George Zimmerman has been revealed to have a formidable one-man arsenal.

The admitted killer’s five guns - including an AR-15 assault-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns - were cataloged by Sanford (FL) police during a domestic dispute last year with girlfriend Samantha Scheibe.

A police report obtained by RadarOnline showed the handguns were fully loaded when cops arrived on the scene, and Scheibe said he brandished his shotgun when she started moving belongings out of the home the two share.

The report showed Zimmerman owns semi-automatic AR-15, a Keltec 12-gauge shotgun, a Walther .380 handgun, a Taurus 9mm handgun, a Glock 19 handgun, more than 100 rounds of ammunition and countless gun holsters and bags.

Authorities seized the gun collection after Scheibe called 911 on last November telling the dispatcher that her infamous flame was pointing a gun at her and had smashed a glass coffee table when she said she was leaving him.

Zimmerman ‘grabbed the shotgun out of the case,’ she told police, according to the report.

‘George Zimmerman then pointed the shotgun at her and asked, ‘Do you really want to do that?’ When she said she was calling 911, the report said.

He ‘struck a glass top table in the living room using the butt of the shotgun, causing it to shatter,’ according to the report.

Zimmerman then slung the shotgun ‘over his shoulder… pushed her out of the house and locked the door behind her,’ the report said.

Police arrested the unstable former neighborhood watchman and charged him aggravated assault, domestic violence and battery. 

Authorities issued a restraining order against Zimmerman after Schiebe further accused him of choking her during a subsequent interview with investigators, but she later dropped all charges and claimed she had been ‘intimidated’ by police.

Back together: The couple was back together and pictured smiling when picking up the guns only weeks later

A friend of Scheibe’s told MailOnline at the time that loved ones feared for her safety.

‘We would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it would end badly,’ the woman said. ‘He is just a time bomb waiting to go off.'

Those sentiments were also echoed last year by both his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman, who also called him a 'monster,' and Sanford Police Chief Steve Bracknell.

Bracknell famously agreed with a local’s comparison of the risk posed by Zimmerman to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza.

Back in the news: Both Zimmerman and rapper DMX found themselves in the headlines last month when a planned boxing match between the two was cancelled

The smiling couple was the picture of happiness when seen a few weeks later leaving a local police department after picking up the guns.

Zimmerman was most recently in the news after a planned ‘celebrity boxing match’ between he and rapper DMX was scuttled when scores of people complained about him fighting a black man on national television.

The crux of his defense for shooting the unarmed Trayvon Martin, 17, was that he couldn’t defend himself against the teen.

He also said was also forced to flee a Miami Beach after people accosted him and a $10,000 bounty was placed on his head.

Heavy firepower: A simple attachment to the AR-15 owned by Zimmerman (similar to the one at left) allows it to legally fire 900 rounds per minute, and the shotgun is powerful enough to take down a fully grown deer

Concealed carry: Zimmerman also owns two pistols like the Glock 19 (left) and the Taurus 9mm (right) above, both can easily be carried by the owner in a manner that others can see
