A sleepy Great Dane puppy has become an internet sensation with his impressive vocal ability.

Thor the dog is seen in a video, peacefully lying in bed before being woken up at 3.30am.

But showing that it's not just humans who struggle in the morning, the little pup repeatedly growls what sounds like 'no' as he refuses to get up.

Animal magic: Thor the Great Dane puppy has become an internet sensation with his impressive vocal ability

Thor's human-like growls continue to sound, causing his waker, Ray Prevo, to laugh.

The pet owner from Birmingham, Michigan, tries various techniques in a bid to rouse his four-legged friend.

'Come on Thor, let's go, wake up!' he is heard saying at one point, before giving the pup's paws and nose a prod.

However, Mr Prevo's instructions fall on deaf ears and Thor merely stretches out, circles around and adopts another sleeping position.

He also continues to bark 'no'.

Mr Prevo reveals on YouTube that he owns a bagel factory which requires him to get up early and start the baking process.

To date, his video of Thor - captured in December 2012 - has been watched more than 1.7million times.

'Aww he's literally saying "nooo" too cute!' one viewer exclaimed.

And another added: 'It's like my 15-year-old old son.'
