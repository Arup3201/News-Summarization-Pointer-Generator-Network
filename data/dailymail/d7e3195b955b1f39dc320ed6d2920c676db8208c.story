Speak to the viewers like they're 10. That's the trick Alistair Darling's media handler likely taught him before his TV tour de force in the Scottish Independence debate.

Scott Chisholm, a former Sky News presenter turned media trainer, reportedly coached the former Labour cabinet minister for his debating clash with Scots First Minister Alex Salmond.

Commentators called the clash a decisive win for the No campaign, with the Mail's Stephen Glover writing glowingly of the once widely-mocked Mr Darling as an 'energised' and 'battle-hardened' political operator.

'Strikingly impressive performance': Commentators widely backed Mr Darling as the debate's surprise winner

Today The Times reports that Mr Chisholm is 'fast emerging as the assistant of choice for top politicians'. 

A
 so-called no-nonsense bruiser who began his career as a print 
journalist in New Zealand in the 1970s, Mr Chisholm went on to be part 
of the original Sky News team when the channel launched in 1989.

He
 is a veteran journalist who also presented the breakfast show on the 
ill-fated ITN News Channel and even sports a Ron Burgundy-style 
moustache.

Now,
 as gamekeeper turned poacher, so to speak, he coaches those who want to
 get the message across into the media with one simple, central message:
 'Pitch it at a ten-year-old.'

Ron Burgundy-style moustache: Scott Chisholm, the newsman turned media trainer who is believed to have coached Darling for his appearance

'If you use words that viewers have to process in order to understand, then they will miss the next three to six words you say.'

That
 strategy believed to have guided Mr Darling to his unexpected victory 
over the wily Mr Salmond in the recent televised Scottish Independence 
debate.

'For
 a man with a reputation as a dry-as-dust bank manager, Alistair Darling
 mounted a strikingly impressive performance,' commented a Daily Mail 
editorial following the face-off.

'In
 two hours of vigorous argument, the former chancellor dismantled Alex 
Salmond’s case for independence, leaving him blustering and deflated.'

Well like among politicians for his discretion, Mr Chisholm last night refused to comment when asked by The Times if he had worked with Mr Darling.

He responded similarly when, following Nick Clegg's unexpected Leaders' Debate coup in 2010, rumours spread that he had worked his magic on the leader of the Liberal Democrats.

But while his clients list is a closely guarded secret, his words of wisdom are more widely reported. In a PR Week seminar in 2010 he told clients to stick to simple language.

'Even the FT uses language that could be understood by a literate 12-year-old, and the tabloids aim for a reading age of about eight or nine,' he was quoted as saying by the industry magazine.

'Think about that when you are talking to a print journalist.'

And he stressed the importance of capturing audiences' imaginations.

'"Imagine" is the most powerful word you can use in an interview,' he said.

'If you just inform people, they will forget the message. Bear in mind the other two Reithian principles - educate and entertain - and they are far more like to recall it.'
