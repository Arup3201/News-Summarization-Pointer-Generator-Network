An actress who stripped naked, put a pot on her head and walked along the street with a kitchen knife and meat cleaver told police she was rehearsing for a role in a new play. 

Elena Yegorova, 45, was spotted without her clothes on and she limped down a street outside her home in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev by worried neighbours who called the police.

When officers arrived she told them she was going to do a stage production of the film Dawn of the Dead, in which flesh-eating zombies take over America.

Elena Yegorova, 45, was spotted walking down a street without her clothes on, a pot on her head and clutching a meat cleaver and a kitchen knife

A spokesman from the force said: 'She explained she wanted to get into character and had read somewhere that zombies can't see very well and are guided by scent, so she had put the pot on her head to make visibility difficult.

'She then said she was planning to get other actors and actresses to do the same when preparing for their roles,' they said. 'We told her that wasn't a good idea.'

Neighbour, Ignat Galkin, 33,  who captured the bizarre scene on her mobile phone said: 'It is probably the weirdest thing I have ever seen.

'She was completely starkers, walking in a straight line, muttering something to herself and holding a knife in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other.

A worried neighbour, who called the police, filmed the incident and said she was concerned she might harm herself or someone else. But Yegorova said she was simply trying to get into the role

'I thought she was clearly off her rocker and how she managed to see where she was going I have no idea.

'But I was worried that she might harm someone or herself so I called the police.' 

Ms Yegorova told local media: 'I believe that as an actress I have a responsibility to my audience to bring as much authenticity to the role as possible.'
