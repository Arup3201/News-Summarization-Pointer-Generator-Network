From Burnley to Barcelona, the signposts all point to trouble ahead for Manchester City and their beleaguered manager Manuel Pellegrini.

It will require his best win as City boss against Barca at the Nou Camp on Wednesday for Pellegrini to save the club’s Champions League dream and, possibly, his job.

But City set out for Spain on Monday on the back of a dismal defeat at Turf Moor and a withering assessment of their shortcomings from Burnley’s match-winner George Boyd.

The Scot accused the Premier League champions of lacking both the appetite for a physical battle and willingness to track back and defend. It was something Burnley detected when they recovered to draw 2-2 at the Etihad in December and exploited again after analysing City’s defeat at Anfield earlier this month.

‘You saw it recently against Liverpool, they don’t track back as well as they go forward so we knew we could exploit that and we did,’ said Boyd, who scored with the sweetest of strikes after an hour.

‘I think it was playing to our strengths and getting in their faces that got us the win. You find with the bigger teams if you get in amongst them, press them hard and tackle they don’t really like it, and we did that.

‘I don’t think Barcelona will be in their faces as much as us and playing the long balls we play, but I thought we fully deserved the victory.

‘We didn’t think they would play as strong a team with Wednesday in mind, but obviously they came here to win and we were better than them.’

City boss Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure although his future will be decided at the close of the season

It is not the first time City’s work ethic has been questioned this season, but there appeared to be a deeper malaise. It was as bad as anything in the post-title slump under Roberto Mancini.

They were flat, dull and at times almost uninterested. Everything that Burnley weren’t.

Sportsmail’s Jamie Redknapp said it was the kind of performance that gets a manager the sack. 

No wonder Pellegrini’s agent was touting him to Napoli last week. There won’t be any knee-jerk reactions from City, however, Pellegrini’s performance will be assessed at the end of the season.

The Chilean could yet mastermind a recovery in Barcelona and take City into the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time, having emerged from the first leg only 2-1 down. But apart from Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov this was close to the team that Pellegrini is expected to put out at the Nou Camp and they lost to a side battling relegation.

Instead of making up ground on Chelsea in the title race, City are now in danger of getting swallowed up in the chase for places in next season’s Champions League and that would test the patience of Pellegrini’s employers.

He maintains that the situation is not as bad as the corresponding period last season when City went out of the FA Cup and Champions League in the space of four days, losing at home to Wigan and away to Barcelona.

The 61-year-old said: ‘It’s always the case before a big game that maybe the minds are not completely on this game,’ he said. ‘But I don’t think it was a case of them not trying. I don’t think Burnley had any chances to score apart from the free-kick which led to the beautiful goal.

‘Of course we are not doing well. You can see that from the amount of points we have dropped. The only thing I can tell you is that it’s not down to the effort of the players. They want, but maybe they can’t at the moment.’
