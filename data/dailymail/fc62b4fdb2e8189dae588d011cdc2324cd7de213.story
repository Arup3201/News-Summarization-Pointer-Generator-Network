Chelsea Clinton went by the pseudonym Diane Reynolds, and Hillary used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the State Department to plan her daughter's wedding, a new report has revealed.

At the center of the controversy is Hillary Clinton's email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com, which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a Senate committee to join newly elected President Barack Obama's cabinet. 

The New York Times reports that Clinton used the address for everything from official government business to matters relating to the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department confirmed on Wednesday that was Clinton's only email alias during her tenure in the Obama administration.

News articles detailing the former secretary of state's arrangement to have her government correspondence run through a private domain name and self-run server have set off alarms about the possibility of her sensitive communications being hacked or destroyed.

A news report reveled that Chelsea used to go  by the pseudonym of Diane Reynolds, and Hillary used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the State Department to plan her daughter's wedding

At least one of Hillary Clinton's longtime aides, Huma Abedin, who is still on Clinton's payroll, had one of the coveted Clintonemail.com addresses, as well, the Times reports.

In the beginning, Chelsea Clinton used the same domain name for her email address, under the name Diane Reynolds, which the Times says she also gave to hotels when she checked in, but switched over to chelseaoffice.com at the urging of the family's advisers. 

Concerned that Hillary could appear too closely tied with the Clinton Foundation if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family, Bill Clinton ran his email through presidentclinton.com.

The Clintons' server was run out of their Chappaqua, New York, home. According to Bloomberg, they transferred it to a commercial provider, MX Logic, after Hillary departed the State Department.

The Clintonemail.com domain name was originally registered to Bill Clinton confidante Eric Hothem, the Times discovered. 

Hothem is the same aide who was charged with packing up and carting off furniture from the White House at the end of Bill Clinton's presidency that he said was 'Clinton’s personal property.' 

The furnishings were later determined to be government property, however, and the Clintons were required to pay  $86,000 in restitution for the items they kept. Others, they had to return.

Hothem now works in finance in Washington, D.C., and another former Clinton staffer's name is on the server registration - Justin Cooper. It is set to expire in 2017, when Hillary Clinton would theoretically take office if she were to compete for and win the presidency next year. 

Cooper has also since left the employment of the Clintons for Teneo Holdings, a firm managed by a former Bill Clinton adviser Douglas Band.

In a tweet late on Wednesday, the likely Democratic presidential candidate said she asked the State Department to release the 55,000 pages emails she turned over. A State Department official told Reuters on Wednesday, though, that 'the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set'

The Clintons are pictured here at a conference for their family foundation in September. Hillary Clinton became a name partner in the endeavor after she left the State Department in 2013. Chelsea Clinton at one time used the same domain name for her emails as her mother. Concerned that Hillary could appear too closely tied with the Clinton Foundation while at State if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family, Chelsea migrated to chelseaoffice.com and Bill ran his email through presidentclinton.com

While the email addresses of all secretaries of state before John Kerry doubled as both their personal and professional points of contact, Clinton's deliberate decision to keep her exchanges out of the reach of the federal government has come under intense scrutiny. 

The White House and the State Department have been careful to state that to their knowledge, all of Clinton's emails have been secured, and additional questions should be directed at Clinton and her team.

A spokesman for Clinton has said that the top-ranking diplomat transmitted all of government-related communications to the State Department, but no proof positive of that assertion exists. 

A security expert who spoke to Bloomberg News warned that in maintaining her own server, Clinton retains the power to wipe all of her data without a trace.  

'You erase it and everything’s gone,' Matt Devost, the president & CEO of global cybersecurity firm FusionX, said.

Another expert, threat intelligence analyst Alex McGeorge told Bloomberg that Clinton's encryption system was misconfigured and could be hacked.

House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday of the debacle that, 'It does beg the question: Were there any sort of classified pieces of information that were flowing through her personal email account?'

Comparing the disclosure to that of former CIA chief David Petraeus, who plead guilty this week to mishandling classified information, Chaffetz pointed out that sharing classified information over email ''with somebody who didn't have a classification' is a crime.

A State Department spokeswoman said Wednesday there's 'no indication that Secretary Clinton used her personal e-mail account for anything but unclassified purposes,' however.

Instead, Clinton had her staff print out classified documents for her or discussed that information over secure phone and video conference calls.

On Wednesday evening Clinton made her first public comments on the fracas.

She wrote on Twitter: 'I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.'

Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed on Thursday while in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  that the department 'will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way.'

A State Department official told Reuters on Wednesday, though, that 'the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set.'

Clinton's team turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. 

Republicans aren't convinced that her entire body of work was disclosed, however, and they're calling for investigations into the matter.

A special House Committee exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch's response to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack is subpoenaing emails from Clinton's personal account.

And the Republican National Committee asked the State Department's inspector general on Thursday insisting it launch an examination of its own to ensure that Clinton followed the law.

Cause of Action, a conservative watchdog group, accused Clinton on Thursday of 'selectively' turning over her correspondence to State, which it said is 'disingenuous and entirely inadequate.' 

Clinton's request that State make public her emails 'does nothing to address the key questions of whether official communications were deleted or whether sensitive classified information was put at risk,' the group's executive director, Dan Epstein, said in a statement. 

'Americans deserve a full investigation into whether evidence exists that official communications weren't being reported for public records, but there may be no way to know for sure,' Epstein said.

'This is exactly why this kind of behavior is against the law. It belies the spirit of openness and transparency in government. It keeps the public in the dark, and it raises serious national security concerns.'
