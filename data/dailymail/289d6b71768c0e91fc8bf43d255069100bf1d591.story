The drive to tear up planning laws is not working and the government is actually introducing even more red tape, a report claims.

Ministers have repeatedly promised to relax the rules around new homes, extensions and larger developments to boost economic growth.

But a right-leaning think tank say the Coalition have brought in nearly twice as many new regulations as Tony Blair's government.

The Centre for Policy Studies said the Coalition have brought in nearly twice as many new planning regulations as Tony Blair's government

The authors say this failure to speed up planning explains persistently high house prices in Britain, slow construction of much-needed new homes and delays to major infrastructure projects.

In a damning analysis, the Centre for Policy Studies conclude: 'The result is an unnecessarily lengthy and costly planning procedure which enables vested interests to prosper, creates commercial uncertainty and restricts new development.'

When they analysed planning laws over a six month period in 1997, the first year under the new Labour government, there were 150 new regulations introduced.

But in the first half of 2011, after the Coalition pledged to get to grips with a bonfire of planning rules, the government introduced 278.

The authors say no other sector of the UK economy is as shackled by regulation as the property and construction sector, which has traditionally been highly centralised.

However they say despite the 'localism' agenda pursued by the Coalition to give councils greater control over development in their area, progress is still too sluggish.

They say the agenda is dominated by 'special interest groups' who oppose development on the green belt such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the RSPB and National Trust.

Many local authorities also 'resist development whether of an economic or residential character', the report says, although they concede the government is cracking down on those not building enough homes.

At last year's Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister said: 'There's something else we need to do – and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain'.

He added: 'For a business to expand, it needs places to build. If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.'

The report calls for 'sunset clauses' on planning regulation – automatically reviewing them after five years; and more to be torn up, to end the 'lawyer's banquet' of regulations.

They add that the planning system needs to operate on a more 'market based' approach looking at economic gains, like other countries, from France to China, where planning permission for development is far quicker.

It also recommends the government look at building Garden Cities modelled on Milton Keynes, that have housing but also jobs, parks, shops and leisure facilities.

Tim Knox, Director of the Centre for Policy Studies said: 'The Coalition is right to have identified the complexity of the current planning system as a major obstacle to growth.

'It should learn from the historic success of Milton Keynes and the plans for a new Garden City at Old Hatfield to see how implementing real reform can free up the planning process to the great benefit of both would-be homeowners and the wider economy.'
