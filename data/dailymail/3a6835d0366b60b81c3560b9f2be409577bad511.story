The family of a college student who went missing two years ago have spoken of their heartbreak over her disappearance.

Lauren Spierer, 20, vanished on June 3, 2011, following a night of partying with friends in downtown Bloomington, Indiana.

There has been no sign of the young blonde woman for two years as her family have struggled with false leads and what they allege is a pact of silence among her friends.

Miss Spierer was due to graduate from Indiana University next month in apparel merchandising - a milestone which causes her parents further agony.

This week her father Robert Spierer told Fox: 'We’re experiencing a terrible strain.We miss Lauren terribly and the not 
knowing makes it all the worse for us.

'We think about her every day and 
we talk about her every day. It’s not any easier today than it was two 
years ago.'

No arrests have been made in relation to the young woman's disappearance.

Human remains were recently found in a remote area of Indiana causing the Spierer family further fears. Autopsy results are expected next week.

The search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another. When the investigation began, five of her male friends, who police believed could have offered insight into the final moments before her disappearance hired criminal defense lawyers and stopped fully cooperating with police.

Firefighters recently rebuilt the weathered signs spread across Bloomington that feature a photograph of the smiling 20-year-old.

The 20 large, wooden-framed signs were erected after she banished in 2011. Firefighters in the college town also
are hanging new posters of Miss Spierer from Greenburgh, New York.

Her mother, Charlene Spierer, thanked the firefighters in a letter for their efforts to keep Lauren’s image prominent in Bloomington. She also said in an email to The Herald-Times that while Lauren won’t be graduating, she will still 'have a presence in Bloomington'.

'Our one and only goal until we find Lauren is to be a reminder, to maintain awareness, to be Lauren’s voice with the hope of getting that one final lead which will allow us to bring our daughter home,' she said in her email.

Bloomington firefighter Lee Chapman said that helping refurbish the signs urging people who might have information on her disappearance to contact authorities has brought him some personal solace.

His 22-year-old son Robert died in a car accident after his first night on duty as a Bloomington Township firefighter.

Chapman said the time he’s spent helping the Spierers 'has just kind of filled the void, where I would be thinking too much. At least I got closure on my end'.
