Stuart Broad is not usually a man to miss a trick but he was oblivious on Friday after becoming the first Englishman to take two Test hat-tricks.

Only when the man on the PA system announced the feat at the end of an over where Broad had struck with his first two balls did any of the England team and, seemingly, the entire Yorkshire crowd, realise that he had also taken the key wicket of Kumar Sangakkara with the last ball of his previous over.

Cue a subdued reaction from a bowler who had earned the acclaim of his home crowd at Trent Bridge when he took his first hat-trick against India three years ago and had also been on the receiving end of Peter Siddle’s hat-trick ball at Brisbane a few months earlier. He is the first bowler to claim one at Headingley for 57 years.

Getting on with it: Broad took two wickets with the first two balls of an over to get his second Test hat-trick

It was that sort of day at this famous
 old ground where it is best to expect the unexpected and where the 
cricket and the crowd rarely fail to entertain. This was a day of 
extremes to start the decisive  second Investec Test — from Broad’s 
hat-trick and Liam  Plunkett’s first five-wicket haul in Test cricket as
 Sri Lanka were hustled out for 257, to a catalogue of English fielding 
errors and two naive self-inflicted blows.

There
 was even the surreal sight, late in the day, of play being stopped when
 Sri Lanka fielder Shaminda Eranga appeared to be struck by a piece of 
cheese thrown by a spectator on the notoriously rowdy Western Terrace.

Alastair
 Cook will be happy to have taken all 10 wickets so quickly after 
putting in Sri Lanka under leaden skies but the England  captain would 
also have been frustrated not to have dismissed them for significantly 
fewer.

Missed chances are 
one thing — and England squandered five on Friday — yet there was also a
 rejected lbw that was shown to be out but which Broad failed to review,
 and an edged catch by Sangakkara to wicketkeeper Matt Prior for which 
no one appealed.

At stumps, 
openers Cook and Sam Robson, who both badly need a score for different 
reasons, negotiated 15 overs to leave England in a position from where 
they should be able to dominate, even though Rangana Herath showed that 
he may well be a threat today with one or two that turned.

Cook,
 without a Test century since he last batted here 11 matches ago, needed
 a good day after increasing the pressure  on himself by hitting back 
at  criticism by Shane Warne and then gambling on inserting Sri Lanka. 
His decision was justified because his four-man seam attack delivered 
the goods on a pitch that did not have as much pace as England hoped but
 still kept the batsmen honest with movement off the seam and through 
the air.

No one knew more 
about exploiting the conditions than adopted Yorkshireman Plunkett, who 
showed he can be the enforcer but also displayed skill by varying his 
length and lines. Plunkett was on a hat-trick himself when he  dismissed
 Mahela Jayawardene and Lahiru Thirimanne in successive balls but he 
will not mind missing out on that after taking Nuwan Pradeep’s wicket 
to  complete his best Test haul.

It
 was quite a performance from a man who had not played a Test in seven 
years before returning at Lord’s last week and who could easily have 
been lost to the game when he left Durham two years ago. And it was 
achieved in front of his father Alan, who has recovered from 
serious illness.

Plunkett’s 
tally could so easily have been even better as he twice should have 
claimed Sangakkara. The Sri Lankan has hit 36 Test hundreds, including 
one at Lord’s in the first Test, and a further 46 half-centuries but he 
can rarely have batted quite as badly in reaching 79 as he did here 
after being given four lives by England.

One
 of the greatest of all batsmen should have been run out before he had 
scored and gave three other chances before Ian Bell, in his 100th Test, 
claimed a sharp catch to send him on his way.

That
 was the first of four wickets to fall in nine balls after tea as any 
hopes Sri Lanka had of embarrassing Cook with a big score evaporated and
 the tourists then failed to make any inroads when England batted. Cook 
and his team have the chance today to bat Sri Lanka out of this game and
 the series.
