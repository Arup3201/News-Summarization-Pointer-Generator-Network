Channel 4 has sparked outrage after producers fitted a statue of Sir Winston Churchill with a straitjacket emblazoned with the word depression, which he suffered from, to highlight mental illness.

The stunt was carried out by the broadcaster 
ahead of its season of primetime programmes looking at the stigma of 
mental health, 4 Goes Mad.

Figures, including the wartime prime minister, were kitted out with bespoke 
jackets with the name of an illness from which each of them 
was said to have suffered.

Controversial: Channel 4 fitted a statue of Sir Winston Churchill with a straitjacket to highlight mental illness. The former prime minister suffered severe bouts of depression which he referred to as his 'black dog'

Churchill referred to his bouts of depression as his 'black dog'.

Today, his grandson, ex-defence secretary Nicholas Soames, told The Sun: 'Even by Channel 4’s pretty dismal standards, this is contemptible.'

Other
notable statues to be targeted in the guerrilla raids were Florence 
Nightingale in London’s Waterloo Place, whose statue had the word bipolar Charles Darwin in Shrewsbury had anxiety and Samuel Johnson in Lichfield also had depression.

Stunt: A statue of Florence Nightingale in Waterloo Place in London was also targeted with the word 'bipolar' as was the statue of Charles Darwin in Shrewsbury which had 'severe anxiety' written on the jacket

Churchill's grandson ex-defence secretary Nicholas Soames, described Channel 4's actions as 'contemptible'

Footage of the stunt was also captured
for a short film to be screened in the station’s arts strand, Random 
Acts, during the season which begins on Monday.

Vandalised: Churchill was given a new look 12 years ago when a strip of turf 
was laid on the scalp to give the appearance of a mohican

The figure of Churchill in Parliament 
Square was famously given a new look 12 years ago when a strip of turf 
was laid on the scalp to give the appearance of a mohican during May Day
disturbances.

Lina Prestwood, the commissioning editor for the season, said: 'Despite the fact one in four of us are likely to experience a mental health condition in our lifetime, misunderstanding and stigma persists.

'We wanted to demonstrate how outmoded attitudes towards mental illness can be - by using the archaic image of the straightjacket in conjunction with individuals whose achievements have made them some of the most celebrated Britons of all time - they also happened to have mental health conditions.

'In 2012, it is no longer straitjackets holding people back - it is discrimination that is preventing people from fulfilling their potential.'

Jane Harris, associate director of charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'We’re pleased to see Channel 4 putting mental health on the agenda with this bold stunt. Churchill in a straightjacket is a provocative but powerful image which highlights the message that mental illness can affect anyone, no matter how able or successful.'

During the season comedian Jon Richardson will investigate obsessive compulsive disorder, while Ruby Wax will follow a number of successful business people as they disclose their mental health problems to employers and in some cases their families.
