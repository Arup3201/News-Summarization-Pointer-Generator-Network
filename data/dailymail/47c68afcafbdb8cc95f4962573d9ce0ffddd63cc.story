The artist: Former St Jude's cancer patient Coraliz Martinez, 12, designed a glass panel which will adorn this year's Times Square crystal ball

For most people, New Year's Eve comes and goes without much more impact than a hangover, but getting to ring in 2014 is something 12-year-old Caroliz Martinez won't take for granted.

The Alabama girl was diagnosed with bone cancer in her left leg last year, but thanks to treatment she received at St Jude's Children's Research Hospital she is now in remission.

Getting to see a New Year will no doubt be a special occasion for the rest of her life, but this year will be really special since she got to design one panel of the thousands decorating the Times Square crystal ball. 

Waterford, the Irish crystal firm 
that replaces the 2,688 glass panels on the ball every year started a 
new 'Greatest Gifts' program this year which will continue for through 
2023 to showcase a new globally treasured theme on the ball each year.

For
 this first year, Waterford partnered with St Jude's to focus on the 
'Gift of Imagination' with a goal of 'brightening the spirits of 
children around the world who are fighting cancer'.

They
 chose Coraliz as the artist and she used colored pencils to sketch a 
single red rose as her symbol of 'hope and positivity'.

'Hope and positivity': Coraliz used colored pencils to sketch a single red rose that symbolized 'hope and positivity' to her. Waterford master sculptor Fred Curtis then traced it onto glass and cut the design with a diamond wheel, trying to get as 'close to her design as possible'

New Year's labor: The six-ton crystal ball is made up of 2,688 panels which Waterford replaces every year. It takes them about a year to finish them all

She says she wants to work at St Jude's one day so that she can help other children dealing with cancer.

Waterford's master sculptor Fred Curtis traced the design onto glass and cut it with a diamond wheel.

'I wanted to get as close to her design as possible,' Mr Curtis said.

It
 takes about a year for the Waterford craftsman to make the crystals and
 about two weeks for workers at Landmark Signs and Electric to install 
them on the six-ton crystal ball, which they finished last Friday.  

Labor of love: Installing the panels takes workers at Landmark Signs and Electric about two weeks to install the more than 2,000 panels. Above, Waterford Crystal's Vice President Regan Iglesia holds up Coraliz's panel (right)

The company also maintains the electronic billboards in Times Square.

According to employee Nick Bonavita, who has worked at Landmark since 2009, they haven't dropped one panel yet.

'We have a perfect record so far,' Mr Bonavita said. 

When
 the ball reaches the bottom of the poll at midnight in New York, it 
will flash 16 million colors, being lit from inside by 32,256 diodes.
