French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir's collection of belongings is described by experts as 'a goldmine'

The single largest archive of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's personal property is going on sale, offering a candid look inside the master painter's life through hundreds of his letters, photos and artworks.

The Renoir Estate Collection is set to be sold in New York on September 19 as 143 lots with an estimated value of $3 million.

The sale includes 19 original sculptural plaster models, or maquettes, created during Renoir's twilight years between 1913 and 1918 with the help of a young assistant, Richard Guino. 

A dedicated artist who painted every day of his life, Renoir died in 1919.

His
personal archive remained with his heirs until 2005 when his grandson 
Paul offered it for sale as a single lot at a Maryland auction where it 
was purchased by the current owner. 

'It
is a gold mine,' said Virginie Journiac, an art historian and former 
curator of the Renoir Museum in Cagnes-sur-Mer, in the south of France.

'These
personal Renoir pieces will be seen for the last time as a unique 
collection unless a single buyer is able to purchase all the lots.'

Other objects in the sale include Renoir's polka-dotted silk scarf, marriage license and a notebook full of critic's reviews.

Renoir's poignant last work, The Woodcocks, was painted the day he died in 1919 and is the only painting in the collection

Renoir's personal items will be up for sale in New York in September at an estimated value of $3million for the 143 lots

The Grande Venus Victorieuse by Renoir created in 1914-1915 is estimated to fetch $900,000 to $1 million

There
are letters from his contemporaries Claude Monet and Edouard Manet; his
Legion of Honor medals; hundreds of glass-plate negatives; and 
documents relating to the construction of Les Collettes, his estate at 
Cagnes-sur-Mer.

Several museums, reached for comment, declined to say if they would bid.

The collection 'illuminates the 
career, life and eminence of this very, very humble man,' said Brian 
Roughton, managing director of fine art at Heritage Auctions.

'It shows the amount of his 
insecurity about his life, about being an artist ... an incredibly 
loving and sensitive man to his entire family.'

Celebrated for his sensual nudes and charming landscapes, Renoir's sculptures are less known.

The maquettes, many of which remained
at Les Collettes until 1960, were based on Renoir's drawings and 
paintings and were produced after a crippling arthritis had nearly 
paralysed his hands.

Guino was paid to work under Renoir's guidance and did not sign the works.

A court recognised him as a co-author in 1973.

The current seller, who also owns the 
maquettes, got embroiled in a legal battle with the Guino family over 
the copyright of eight of the maquettes. The case was settled in 2008, 
and Heritage said all the material was being offered free and clear.

Showing a rarely-seen glimpse into Renoir's family life, a bust of his son Coco dated 1907-08 is expected to sell for $30,000

The auction house did not name the 
consignor but published reports at the time identified her as Tracy 
Penwell, an Arizona gallery owner.

Renoir
considered 'Large Venus Victorious,' a life-size statue of the Roman 
goddess elegantly holding a drape in one hand and an apple in the other,
a masterpiece.

Created in 1914-1915, it is estimated to bring $900,000 to $1 million (£578,000 to £642,000).

The
auction also features the only two sculptures entirely executed by 
Renoir's hands - a medallion at a guide price of $20,000 (£13,000) and a
bust of his youngest son Claude, "Coco" at $30,000 (£19,000).

Woodcocks, at an estimated value of $80,000-$120,000 (£51,000 - £77,000) is the only painting in the sale.

The small picture is of great historical significance because it is believed to be Renoir's last work, said Journiac, whose just-published book The Late Renoir, The Riviera Years is largely based on the material in the collection.

'He painted this still life with two dead birds some hours before he died, which is quite symbolic,' she said.

While there is abundant literature on Renoir, Journiac said, 'This collection offers a lot of new information, especially of his last less studied period.'
