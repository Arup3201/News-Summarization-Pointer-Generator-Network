A small-town police chief who recorded a series of foul-mouthedÂ  Youtube videos ranting about John Kerry and the UN and firing his automatic weapon, has been fired.

Mark Kessler had already been suspended for 30 days for posting the profanity-laced pro-gun videos. Now Gilberton Borough Council, in Pennsylvania, has voted to sack him from his role in the community.

Kessler has acknowledged that his videos are inflammatory, but he told NBC News they were designed to draw attention to what he sees as the erosion of the USA's Second Amendment and the freedom of speech.

'Libtards': Mark Kessler used vile language in Internet tirades about gun rights

Tough guy: Kessler invites the 'libtards' to 'come and get it,' referring to his guns

He said it was his 'right' and 
'freedom' to make the videos, in which he repeatedly fires the 
borough-owned automatic weapon. He told NBC Philadelphia after
being fired: 'I feel in my heart I'm doing the right thing.'

Several
Kessler supporters showed up at the hearing yesterday, most were 
members of his 'Constitution Security Force' - his pro-gun group. One 
member got into an argument with an opponent, according to the news 
service.

In the hearing, 
Kessler's lawyer, Joseph Nahas, claimed the charges brought against his 
client were inflated to justify his dismissal for the videos, said NBC 
News.

In one video, he 
claims to be apologising for using offensive language in a previous 
video. He then says he's kidding, tells people who were offended to 'go 
f*** yourself' and then fires founds from a machine gun.

Supporters: Kessler leaves City Hall and is met by supporters - some of whom encouraged him to run for president

In
another video, he complains about Secretary of State John Kerry, the 
United Nations and other 'libtards' and 'p******' he claims are trying 
to take his guns.

After firing more rounds from a machine gun, he invites the 'libtards' to 'come and get it.'

Kessler
was suspended in July for improper use of state purchasing programme, 
failing to submit required crime data and making derogatory comments 
about borough officials.

After the hearing Nahas declined the offer to comment, NBC News said.

When
the videos first surfaced last month, Gilberton Mayor Mary Lou Hannon 
said she found the language in the videos offensive and she understood 
that others did as well.

Armed: supporters of Kessler's showed up to City Hall armed as the council voted to suspend him for 30 days

'I think it's blackened our eye a little, but we are a strong community,' Hannon said at the time. 'We will go on from here.'

Officials
have said that Kessler bought the weapons with his own money and 
donated them to the police department, an action approved by the 
council. Kessler told PennLive.com on Wednesday that he also donated the
ammunition used in the videos.
