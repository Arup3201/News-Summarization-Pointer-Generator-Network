A man suffering from ALS, who shared his story with millions in a touching Ice Bucket Challenge video this summer, has been given his dream wedding.

Anthony Carbajal, from Temecula, California, married his girlfriend Laarne Palec on November 19 in an intimate ceremony at the Grind Coffee Shop in Riverside, California, where the couple had spent their first date.

The pair had been dating for a year this past January when the 26-year-old received the diagnosis - which was especially devastating because his mother has battled ALS for years, and the same disease took his grandmother's life.

ALS is a neurological disease that attacks the nerve cells and causes muscle weakness, affecting one's ability to walk, talk, eat and breathe. According to the National Institutes of Health, most people with ALS die from respiratory failure within three to five years from the onset of symptoms.

Mr Carbajal told Brides magazine, which helped put together the wedding, that he was hesitant to pop the question because he was worried about the amount of care he'll require when his symptoms worsen.

'I was cautious to ask Laarne to spend the rest of her life with me because this disease requires a lot of care. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone,' he said. 'But throughout my diagnosis, Laarne made it clear that she wasn’t going to leave my side.'

Unconditional love: 'She told me that she wanted to be with me through the good and the bad that's inevitable,' Mr Carbajal said

But his new bride put his fears to rest, assuring him that it was meant to be.

'She told me that she wanted to be with me through the good and the bad that's inevitable. Then I got down on my knee and proposed. Having her tell me that she loves me unconditionally was priceless and I think, looking back, I needed that,' he said.

Mr and Mrs Carbajal are both wedding photographers and met when he was hired to shoot her sister's nuptials.

Mr Carbajal said that as a newlywed, he's now even more determined to fight the illness.

'I’m doing whatever I can to change my outcome and be on this earth longer with Laarne. I think that’s the hardest thing - I found my soulmate and ALS might take me away from her earlier,' he added.

The wedding took place in front of 100 friends and family members, and the groom said that the couple 'just wanted all of our loved ones to feel like they were at home, have a good time and celebrate our love with us.'

He's now eagerly anticipating the the joys of married life.

'Laarne's family is very conservative. So I’m looking forward to going on a family vacation and sleeping in the same room together!' he said.

'I look forward to having a place to call our own and getting a dog. I'm just excited to wake up with her every morning and have a cup of coffee. We see a life full of happiness together - that’s what we see.'

Mr Carbajal's ALS Challenge video, which showed him caring for his ill mother and speaking of his own fears about the disease, now has more than 16 million views.

'Nobody wants to see a depressing person that's dying and has two to five years to live. They don't want to talk about it; they don't want their day ruined,' he said in the emotional video. 

'Eventually, I won't be able to use my arms or hands at all. Eventually, I won't be able to walk, talk and breathe on my own, and that's the real truth of what ALS is. It's devastating.'
