It was the starting point for tens of thousands of men risking their lives on what Winston Churchill called the 'worst journey in the world'.

Loch Ewe, the isolated inlet in the northwest Highlands of Scotland, was where the Arctic Convoys departed for their perilous missions to Russia during the Second World War.

Now 40 of the dwindling band of heroes who braved sub-zero temperatures, terrifying seas and a gauntlet of German warplanes and U-boats are returning.

Heroes: Forty of the men who braved the sub-zero temperatures during the Second World War will return to Loch Ewe, in the northwest Highlands of Scotland

The proud veterans will gather on the shores of the loch to remember their fallen colleagues, 3,000 of whom perished in the freezing waters, at a special ceremony in May.

Dignitaries will present 36 former seamen with the Arctic Star - the new medal struck after a campaign by the Daily Mail to recognise their extraordinary sacrifice.

Four have already received it.

The day will include a memorial service led by Right Reverend Mark Strange, the Bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness, at the Arctic Convoy Memorial high above the mouth of Loch Ewe.

Honoured: The very first Arctic Star was awarded to Commander Eddie Grenfell who has battled tirelessly for 16 years for the convoy heroes to be recognised

Francis Russell, chairman of the 
Russian Arctic Convoy Museum Project, which has organised the event, 
said: ‘We are honouring all the convoy veterans and this will be unique 
for us all – for the veterans to receive their medals officially and for
all of us to witness such a well-deserved, long awaited and memorable 
occasion.

'It is of special
significance that this is happening on the shores of Loch Ewe, where 
many of the veterans began their journeys to Russia.'

Forty survivors of the convoys - now in their 80s and 90s - were honoured with the Arctic Star medals at a ceremony in Downing Street earlier this month.

They had waited for seven decades to be honoured. Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that he was 'righting a wrong'.

The very first Arctic Star was awarded to Commander Eddie Grenfell, 93, who has battled tirelessly for 16 years for the convoy heroes to be recognised.

Cdr Grenfell survived ten minutes in the icy Arctic waters before he was rescued after his ship SS Empire Lawrence was bombed in May 1942.

More than 3,000 Royal Navy and merchant seaman died between 1941 and 1945 on the convoys. Only about 200 veterans are still alive.

The convoys carried four million tons of cargo including tanks, planes, fuel and food to slow Germany's advances on the Eastern front.

Many vessel massed in Loch Ewe before embarking on the treacherous journey past Norway and through the Barents Sea to Murmansk and Archangel.

More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors and merchant seamen took part. In total, 87 merchant ships and 18 British warships were sunk.

But the Cold War meant it was politically difficult to give the survivors a medal for assisting the Soviet Union and it only now that the Arctic Convoy veterans have been properly recognised.

Mr Cameron ordered the medals amid concerns many veterans would die before they were awarded.

Campaigners will use the occasion to launch a £2.5milion fundraising drive during WWII Week to build a museum and new community centre on the site of HMS Helicon, the Arctic Convoys base from 1941-1945.

The veterans will have chance to see the plans for the new development and to hear how their stories of bravery, loss and suffering will be recorded for future generations.
