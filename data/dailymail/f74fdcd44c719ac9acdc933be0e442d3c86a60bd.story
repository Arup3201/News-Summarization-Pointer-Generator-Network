With its dingy carpeting, water-stained wooden shingles and tired decor, this clapboard house in the struggling former timber town of Aberdeen, Washington, would usually fetch around $67,000.

But because it is the former home of troubled Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, who committed suicide nearly 20 years ago, 1210 East 1st Street is going on the market this week for $500,000.

The house, which is being sold by Cobain's mother, Wendy O'Connor, still has the rock legend's graffiti on the walls, and his bedroom carpet, curtains and even the mattress that aspiring young musician slept on.

The tired 1.5-story bungalow two-hours southwest of Seattle lies a short walk from a riverfront park dedicated to Cobain's memory, and the family is open to offers from anyone interested in turning it into a museum.

To help sell the property, the family is offering a glimpse into the early life of its tortured and talented son through photos shot at the house, including one of a chocolate-frosted birthday cake for Kurt and a shot of a teenage Cobain smiling, guitar in hand, in his messy room.

His room still has the stencil-like band names - Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin - he reportedly put on the walls, as well as the holes he put in them.

'We've decided to sell the home to create a legacy for Kurt, and yes, there are some mixed feelings since we have all loved the home and it carries so many great memories,' Cobain's sister, Kim Cobain, said.

'But our family has moved on from Washington, and feel it's time to let go of the home.'

The Cobains bought the house, a 1923 structure with a recent coat of yellow paint, in 1969 when Kurt was two. He lived there until his parents separated when he was nine, and again with his mother during his later teen years.

The heroin-addicted Cobain committed suicide in Seattle in 1994 when he was 27, after a meteoric career that popularised the Pacific Northwest's heavy, muddy 'grunge' rock.

The last of Nirvana's three studio albums, 'In Utero,' came out in September 1993, and Universal Music Group has released a re-mastered version and a box set.

Cobain described his early childhood in Aberdeen as happy. He would ride his bike around the small yard and even off the roof of the little yellow house, and practise on a set of Mickey Mouse drums his parents bought him.

In one event that entered family lore, Cobain's father, Don, trapped a rat in a garbage can in the garage.

Don tried to spear it with a broomstick, but the rodent clambered up the handle, over Don's shoulder to the ground and across Kurt's toes to safety, which five-year-old Kurt found hilarious.

But his parents' divorce scarred him deeply. At one point, he scrawled 'I hate Mom, I hate Dad' on his bedroom wall, Cobain's biographer Charles. R. Cross wrote.

'It's a place where he had very fond memories, but it's the house where his parents got divorced,' Cross said in an interview. 'He couldn't wait to get away, but it's a place that helped shape who he became.'

The home was last lived in by a family friend four years ago. According to The Agency, the Beverly Hills, California-based luxury real estate firm marketing the property, it features the dining room table and hutch from when Cobain lived there, while his mattress is tucked away in a musty upstairs crawl space.

Cobain lived in about 20 houses in his life, Cross said, and this isn't the first one offered for sale based on its connection to rock history.

In 2002, an Oregon couple bought a home in nearby Montesano for $42,500. When they learned that Cobain had lived there with his father from 11 to 15, they sold it for $210,000.
