An antioxidant created in the lab could keep our skin younger for longer by protecting it from sun damage.

Scientists at Newcastle University say the molecule, Tiron, gives complete protection from UVA rays - which make up 95 per cent of the UV radiation in sunlight.

They hope Tiron could be given to people in food or cosmetics.

UVA radiation speeds up skin ageing and causes wrinkles. It penetrates deep into the skin, damaging connective tissue and increasing the risk of skin cancer.

The sun’s rays also contain UVB, a type of radiation which causes sunburn and is again linked to skin cancer.

Team leader Professor Mark Birch-Machin said the results, published in the FASEB Journal, are ‘exciting and promising’.

He added it is ‘early days’ for developing the antioxidant into a useable form – and more tests are needed to make sure it is not toxic.

Scientists already know antioxidants in green tea, red wine and spices can help to protect cells somewhat. But laboratory tests showed Tiron provided 100 per cent UVA protection.

Mr Birch-Machin said a commercial product could be available within five years.

Cancer Research UK said the findings should be treated cautiously. Dr Indi Ghangrekar said: ‘This research was done on cells in the lab . . . It is a long way off telling us whether it could be useful in any way in skin cancer prevention.’
