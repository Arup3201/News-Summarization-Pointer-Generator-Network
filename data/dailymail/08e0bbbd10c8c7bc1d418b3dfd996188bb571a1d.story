A junior at the University of Massachusetts is the first openly gay player in Division 1 Basketball.

Derrick Gordon came out publicly in April following other professional athletes such as Robbie Rogers, Jason Collins, and Michael Sam who began paving the way for acceptance in sports.

'This is the happiest I have ever been in my 22 years of living...No more HIDING!!!...Just want to live...' Gordon tweeted after coming out, reports The New York Daily News.

Last night Derrick Gordon made his team proud by gaining 17 points and two free throws in under 20 seconds and helped them defeat Siena 95-87.

Last season, Gordon helped take his UMass team the Minutemen to an NCAA Tournament.

'I went into it like a regular game. I’ve been here before, but it was good to see the support I had,' said Gordon of his win last night.

Gordon's proud family, including his twin brother Daryl who was recently released from prison, was in the audience.

'I held back the tears,' Gordon told ESPN.

'I haven't seen my brother since he's been out. It was good to see my family sitting in that section -- it's something I've been dreaming about,' he said.

Not only did Gordon have his family in the audience, he has a group of screaming fans.

People in the stands held a giant banner with his jersey number that said #BETRUE. It's the same as the Nike slogan from his coming put announcement.

People on his team are even nicer to him after coming out, Gordon says.

'They ask me to play video games with them, eat with them,' Gordon said.

'We became a lot closer, and it shows on the court. My game has gone to another level. I'm more confident in my game; my shooting has gone up as well. I'm ready to show the whole world that I'm the complete package.'
