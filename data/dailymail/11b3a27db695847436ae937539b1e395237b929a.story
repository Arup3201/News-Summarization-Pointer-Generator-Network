Seven people in their early 20s have been injured - at least three, critically - after being shot multiple times by a gunman during a spring break party on the Florida Panhandle, police have said.

The unsuspecting revelers were shot in the head, neck, chest and other areas at the house party in Panama City Beach in the early hours of Saturday. Multiple 911 calls flooded in just before 1am,

Deputies arriving on the scene found a sprawling crime scene with victims inside the home, outside and across the street from it, and in the street's median, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said.

Shortly after, a suspect matching witnesses' descriptions - David Jamichael Daniels, 22 - was arrested near the Gulf Of Mexico. He has since been charged with seven counts of attempted murder. 

In custody: David Jamichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, was arrested over the shooting Saturday

Victim: Tykeria Ethridge, 22, was shot in the neck and shoulder, and posted a photo from her hospital bed (right), saying she was 'just an innocent person like everybody else'

Daniels, who is from Mobile, Alabama, is now in custody awaiting his first court appearance.

After arriving on the scene on Saturday morning, Officers immediately set up a perimeter. A .40-caliber handgun believed to have been used was found in the yard of a nearby home.

The sheriff's office said several of the victims were students from Alabama A&M University in Panama City Beach for spring break.

At least three were critically injured: Kearria Freed, 20, who was shot in the head; Devanta Moore, 21, who was shot in the chest; and Henton Franklin, 22, who was shot in the side.

Etheridge documented her hospitalization on her Facebook page, and said she was 'just an innocent person like everybody else'.

The 22-year-old, who has a young son, said she thought she had died.  'I was shot several times including in the neck. I just knew I was dead,' Etheridge wrote. 

'All I could think about was my son. He (sic) all I got. 'Im cryin right now the fact im stuck w these bullets man life too short.  I thank the Lord for still being here cus he aint done w me yet.'

Shooting: Multiple 911 calls flooded in just before 1 a.m., reporting the shootings at the house party in Panama City Beach, and deputies arriving on the scene found a sprawling crime scene

Police around Panama City Beach said they have found it almost impossible to police the college students who have flocked to the area and then the out-of-towners who are trying to join in.

'This is what we’ve been trying to warn people about,' Sheriff Frank McKeithen told The Panama City News Herald.

'It’s been a rough time and there are two completely different elements of spring break. 

'There are the college kids who are here for their spring break and there is the group of people drawn here because of them.'
