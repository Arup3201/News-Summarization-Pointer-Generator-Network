The honours keep on coming for Laura Davies. Less than 48 hours after a visit to Buckingham Palace to be formally made a Dame, Britain’s greatest-ever female golfer learned on Wednesday she is to be inducted into the prestigious World Golf Hall of Fame.

The ceremony will take place at St Andrews University in July next year in the same week as the Open Championship will be played over the Old Course.

With 74 worldwide victories to her name including four majors, it’s another well-deserved honour for 50-year-old Davies, who heads up the Hall of Fame class of 2015, alongside Australian David Graham, former Open Champion Mark O’Meara and golf course designer AW Tillinghast.

English star Davies has won four majors and 74 tournaments worldwide during a glittering career 

‘It’s a wonderful honour and I am especially looking forward to being inducted at St Andrews,’ said Davies.

Putting the honour into context, the Hall of Fame selection commission only meets every other year and no more than five inductees are permitted at any one time.

The Hall of Fame, based in St Augustine, Florida, recognises not just the leading players but others who have made a contribution to the game’s rich history like Tillinghast, who designed such world-renowned courses as Winged Foot, Bethpage Black and Baltusrol.

O’Meara won not only The Open in 1998 but the Masters as well, plus 20 other victories worldwide during his illustrious career. Graham, also a double major champion, becomes just the third Australian golfer to be inducted after Greg Norman and Peter Thomson.

The 16-person selection commission was headed by Hall of Fame members Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam. Leading administrators such as Tim Finchem, commissioner of the PGA Tour, George O’Grady, his counterpart at the European Tour, and Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club were also involved, as was Sportsmail golf correspondent Derek Lawrenson, one of three representatives from the media.
