A homeowner had a shock after finding animal enforcement officers trying to remove a black bear from a tree in his garden.

The 18-month-old bear had been chased through an Erie neighborhood in Pennsylvania on Tuesday afternoon, after being spotted near homes.

When the 125lb bear took refuge in a tree, wildlife officers were able to tranquillize it and move it to a more suitable habitat.

Steve Sienerth, who owns the house where the bear was found, said: 'It's just crazy. It's never happened before and I hope it never happens again'.

The 46-year-old toldÂ Go Erie he came home to find police in his yard and a 'big bear in a tree'.

It is thought that the bear, which was first spotted in west Erie at about 1pm, is the same animal that has been seen frequently in the area in the past few weeks.

Its appearance was a surprise for animal enforcement official Rob Culbertson, who said: 'Outskirts yeah, but this doesn't happen often [in the city]. We don't know where this one came from.'

After tracking it through the city, wildlife officials were able tranquilize the bear as it hid in a tree. Once it was asleep, they knocked it to the ground and moved it to a safer location, according to WICU News.

'We try to detain the bear in one spot and try to keep people away as best we can, for the safety of the bear and the people,' Mr Culbertson said.

It is likely that the 18-month-old bear was looking for somewhere to live. Bears of that age are often chased away by their mothers at this time of year.

Although he fell from the tree after being tranquilized, the bear appeared to be in good condition.

'We'll make sure he's ok. As soon as he wakes up he'll be on his own,' wildlife conservation officer Mike Girosky said.

He added that after collecting information about the bear, it will be released into the wild.
