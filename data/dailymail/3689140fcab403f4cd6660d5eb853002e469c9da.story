Celtic idol Alan Thompson has revealed how his two-year rift with former Parkhead boss Neil Lennon has finally ended.

Lennon dismissed his best friend and colleague in the summer of 2012 amid allegations and whispers over Thompson's off-field lifestyle.

Admitting the loss of his job placed him in a 'bad place' Thompson, a veteran of Martin O'Neill's Seville team, is back in football as assistant manager to Lee Clark at Championship Blackpool.

And after clear the air talks with Bolton boss Lennon in recent months Thompson says the pair are trying to repair their relationship.

'I have spoken to Lenny on a few occasions recently,' said Thompson in a wide-ranging Sportsmail interview.

'Those are the first conversations for a long, long time and what happened is now put to bed, we've moved on. We speak. We speak.

'We are not as we were before when we were best mates. But we are on speaking terms.'

Dismissed just six weeks after Celtic won their last match with Rangers 3-0, securing the first title of three-in-a-row, Thompson now regards it as one of the blackest periods of his life, but insists: 'I'm over all that now. I felt let down at the time but I don't want to go into that.

'That was disappointing, a real, real bad time.

'As I say, I'm over it now. I'm looking forward, not back.

'People said stuff about me at the time and that was hard - but I know what football is like.

'I can't do anything about all that. What happened happened.

'I know what really happened. How things developed and how they ended wasn't ideal.'

Cutting himself off from his former teammates for over a year Thompson says the bonds between O'Neill's tight-knit Parkhead side are now healing after the wounds created by his sacking.

'There was a Stilian Petrov benefit game up at Parkhead last year and at that time I just wanted to keep out the way.

'It was Stan's day and I didn't want anything detracting from that.

'Neil and I hadn't spoken at that time – but I have seen him three or four times since.

The two were close friends before Lennon dismissed Thompson in the summer of 2012

'He has given me his views and I have given him mine and we move on.

'Life is short. I have nothing but respect for Neil and I'm glad it's done and dusted and that we can get on with our lives and careers.

'I was down in Norwich a few weeks ago and had a glass of wine with Chris Sutton.

'You talk about good times and who is doing what now.

'The way I left Celtic as a player and a coach was never ideal, but that's what happens.

'I'm sure a lot of Celtic fans will appreciate what I did for the club and that we all have some good memories.'

Lennon has since moved from Celtic to Bolton Wanderers in the Championship
