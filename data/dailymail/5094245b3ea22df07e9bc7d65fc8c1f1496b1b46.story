A collection of treasures from one of Britain's grandest country houses is to be sold for more than £10million to help pay for the upkeep of the property – which is famed for its starring role in hit TV show Brideshead Revisited.

The items, which range from a £3.5million painting of Venice's Grand Canal by Bernardo Bellotto to a £1.2million portrait of Henry VIII, are from a private collection of Castle Howard in North Yorkshire.

Set in the rolling Howardian hills, the 18th Century country house is owned by the Howard family, having been passed down from its original owner – the 3rd Early of Carlisle – who lived at the property in 1699.

Treasured items from Castle Howard in North Yorkshire, which featured in TV drama Brideshead Revisited and is currently occupied by Simon Howard and his wife Rebecca (pictured), are to be auctioned off for more than £10million to help secure the future of the grand country estate

Set in the rolling Howardian hills in North Yorkshire, the 18th Century country house is owned by the Howard family, having been passed down from its original owner – the 3rd Early of Carlisle – who lived at the property in 1699. Brothers Simon and Nicholas currently reside in the house

The items are to be auctioned for more than £10million, including a £3.5million artwork of Venice's Grand Canal by Bernardo Bellotto (above). It was painted by Bellotto when he was just 16-years-old, at a time when he was working in the studio of his uncle - Italian painter Canaletto

The treasures have been collected over the last 300 years but will now be auctioned in the summer to help the current owners of Castle Howard – brothers Nicholas and Simon Howard – secure the house's financial future.

The collection has been hailed as 'one of the finest' in private hands anywhere in the world, but the Howards have insisted selling the items will not damage the integrity of the overall collection at the estate.

As well as paintings and portraits, the collection of 10 items also includes 17th-century Italian furniture and Roman antiquities.

However, the most expensive piece is the artwork of Venice's Grand Canal by Bernardo Bellotto, who was the pupil and nephew of Canaletto, which has an estimated value of £3.5million.

Another sought-after item is the portrait of Henry VIII from the studio of acclaimed court painter Hans Holbein, which shows the monarch standing in a rich red coat and carrying his gold sceptre.

Other lots in the upmarket collection include Ferdinand Bol's Portrait of a Boy, which has an estimate of between £2million and £3million, and a Roman Egyptian vase which has a guide price of up to £600,000.

It also includes a pair of extremely rare Italian pietre dure inlaid cabinets made in Rome in the 17th Century, which are expected to sell for up to £1million.

The sale comes just months after the Howard family announced changes at the distinct country home.

The house, which gained notoriety after being used as the backdrop to TV dramas Brideshead Revisited and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, is under financial pressure.

It has been occupied for the last 32 years by Simon, who volunteered to take on the ownership after graduating from Eton in 1983.

Nearly 20 years later, he married his second wife Rebecca – dubbed 'The Woman Who Set Out To Marry A House' by Vanity Fair magazine – and she soon gave birth to twins, Merlin and Octavia.

They threw themselves into the huge task of upkeeping the property and its 10,000 acre estate.

However, in recent years Simon was diagnosed with throat cancer, and his older brother Nicholas – who had been working as a photographer in London – decided to move into the property with his wife Victoria, a former chief executive of HarperCollins.

Other items to be sold at auction include a 1542 portrait of Henry VIII from the studio of Hans Holbein, which is expected to fetch up to £1.2million (right). A pair of Italian pietrre dure and ormolu-mounted cabinets from the early 17th Century (left) are to sell for up to £1million

A 17th Century Dutch painting - Ferdinand Bol’s Portrait of a Boy (pictured) - will also be auctioned by the Howard family for up to £3million

Castle Howard, which was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and built between 1699 and 1712, has been home to 10 generations of the Howard family.

Spreading out over 145 rooms, the house is considered one of Vanbrugh's greatest achievements. 

Its magnificent art collection includes ancient sculptures, Old Masters and works by Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough.

The house comes complete with temples, follies, peacocks, 100 staff and 10,000 rolling acres — as well as 250,000 paying visitors a year.

The  estate is owned by a private limited company, and is occupied by brothers Simon and Nicholas Howard and their respective families.

Both families now contribute to the day-to-day running of the house, and the plan to auction off treasured items comes after they looked into options to reduce the home's annual upkeep costs.

As well as selling off treasured keeps, another money-saving plan includes fitting an environmentally-friendly heating system to halve the house's annual fuel bill – but the outlay cost is £160,000 alone.

Nicholas said the aim of the auction, which will be conducted with Sotheby's in London, was to help move the house into the next century.

He said: 'I am privileged to be able to say that Castle Howard is my family's heritage and has been since it was built over 300 years ago.

'With that privilege comes the responsibility of ownership, and the Trustees' unanimous decision to hold this sale is the exercise of that responsibility.

'If the sale helps to secure that heritage as the house moves into its fourth century then it will have achieved its goal.

'To this end, we have selected for sale at Sotheby's a small number of works which, while of great intrinsic interest, have been carefully chosen so as not to detract from the overall integrity of the collection.'

His brother Simon added: 'Running Castle Howard for the last 30 years has been an immense privilege.

'Now, as a new chapter in its history opens, the sales that we are planning at Sotheby's will make an important contribution to the long-term future of the Castle Howard estate and collections.'

Nicholas Howard said the aim of the auction, which will be conducted with Sotheby's in London in July, was to help move the house forward

The stunning Yorkshire country estate was used for filming of TV drama Brideshead Revisited, which featured Jeremy Irons in the 1980s

The treasures to be auctioned have been part of Castle Howard for the last 300 years and have an estimated total guide price of £10million

Henry Wyndham, chairman of Sotheby's Europe said the collection 'ranks among the finest private art collections in the world'.

She said: 'The collections at Castle Howard chart two millennia of history and 300 years of collecting.

'The carefully selected group of works to be auctioned this summer is testament to the taste of a series of enlightened art patrons, starting with the visionary 3rd Earl of Carlisle, and continuing through his Romanophile son, Henry, collector of antiquities and Venetian vedute, to his diplomat grandson Frederick, 5th Earl of Carlisle, who is thought by many to have been the most refined English collector of the period around 1800.'

The collection will be auctioned, with a combined estimate in excess of £10million, at the Sotheby's London Old Masters and Treasures sale on July 8.
