A woman whose mum was raped and murdered by her own dad has told how she forgave him on his deathbed and even apologised to him for not visiting him in prison.

Samantha Lawler was just 18 when she found her mother Suzanne strangled to death days after she told her husband she wanted to leave him.

Leo Lawler admitted first-degree murder and rape and was sentenced to life.

But, despite justice being done, Miss Lawler couldn't move on with her life until she decided to forgive her dad.

The 33-year-old waitress from New York said: 'I lost both my parents when my dad killed my mum and I spent the next ten years unable to move on, blaming him for what he did.

'When I finally saw him 13 years after he killed Mum, I told him I loved him and I was sorry I hadn't visited.

'I forgave him and felt a huge weight lift from my shoulders. I got my dad back and my life back too. I could finally move on.'

Miss Lawler recalls having a happy childhood with sister, Kim, before their mum's death.

She said: 'They argued like anyone and sometimes Dad called Mum stupid.

'But otherwise I thought we were pretty normal. Dad was always trying to make us laugh.'

But when Miss Lawler was 18, her mum confessed she wanted to leave her husband.

'I wanted Mum to be happy so I supported her, but Dad told her if she left he'd put her six feet under.

'He said things like that all the time when he was angry, we didn't think he was serious. It left her even more determined to get out though.'

Miss Lawler was confident her mum, then aged 50, would cope on her own.

'She had plans to study teaching and was excited about getting her own place, but Dad wasn't adjusting.

'Mum hadn't even left and he stopped going to work and started drinking heavily.'

In December 1999, a week after Mr Lawler had threatened his wife, the couple's daughter came home to find her mum lying on the sofa covered in a blanket.

'It wasn't like her to take naps in the day, but I assumed she was asleep so not wanting to disturb her, I went upstairs,' Miss Lawler explained. 'But two hours later I came down to find Mum hadn't moved. Then I noticed blue patches on her face and realised she wasn't breathing.

'I shook her body, moved the blanket and found her shirt pulled open.

'I started to resuscitate her but it was too late. She had already gone. I knew Dad had done it and I knew my life was never going to be the same again.'

Mr Lawler went on the run but was arrested the next day hiding in a motel under a false name.

The family decided they didn't want Mr Lawler to receive the death penalty.

Miss Lawler said: 'I wanted him to suffer in prison and spend time thinking about what he'd done.'

In November 2000 Mr Lawler, 57, of Northeast Second Street, Broward County, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and rape, at a Florida court.

He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

The next ten years passed in a blur for Miss Lawler, who struggled to cope with what had happened.

She said: 'I'd look through family photos knowing Dad would never walk me down the aisle and my children – if I had a family – would never meet their grandparents.'

In 2010, Kim Lawler visited their dad in prison.

'She told me he'd had a stroke and couldn't speak or move his right side, but I was still too angry with him to care.'

It was another two years before she became curious about her father.

In October 2012 she called the prison where Mr Lawler, 69, was being held.

'They told me they'd been trying to reach me as Dad was in hospital days from death. I wanted to ask why he'd killed Mum and I realised this could be my last chance.

Visiting Mr Lawler in Jacksonville Hospital, his daughter said she barely recognised him.

'His limbs were curled up close to his body after he'd had multiple strokes,' Miss Lawler recalled. 'He had a machine breathing for him so he couldn't talk and couldn't move.

'He was handcuffed to the bed but really not in any state to hurt anyone. I felt sorry for him.

'For years I'd wanted him to suffer and now he was, I felt guilty that I'd wished it.

'I thanked him for being an incredible dad and realised he was a good person who'd done something wrong.

'I told him I loved him and I was sorry I hadn't visited. Then I said I forgave him.'

After her visit, doctors told Miss Lawler that normally patients with his condition are allowed to choose between being treated or being allowed to die.

But prisoners didn't have those same rights and would be treated regardless.

'They gave me the chance to end his suffering,' Miss Lawler said. 'I realised if Dad was treated he would remain handcuffed to a bed all his life and I didn't want him to be in any pain.'

So two days later, doctors ceased treatment and Mr Lawler passed away.

'I was pleased I got to say goodbye,' Miss Lawler said. 'I would have never forgiven myself if I hadn't.

'People are amazed I forgave my dad. They don't think they could do the same.

'I thought the same once, but I realised hating him every day wasn't doing me any good.'
