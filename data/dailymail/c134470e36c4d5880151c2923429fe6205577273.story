At the age of 28, with a wealth of Champions League and international experience under his belt, Charlie Mulgrew has long since moved beyond the point in his life where he might become star struck at anyone walking through the doors at Lennoxtown.

Nonetheless, Celtic’s Mr Versatile admits the appointment of John Collins as Ronny Deila’s No 2 last week momentarily transported him back to a time he was just another kid with a ball at his feet and a head full of dreams.

For any Celtic fan of Mulgrew’s age, those formative years following the club were testing times. The early to mid-1990s were a barren period in the club’s history.

Collins and his midfield colleague Paul McStay did not so much carry the team as prevent it falling off a cliff.

Despite — to put it kindly — the mediocrity that surrounded the pair in that era, their talents still shone like beacons in the dark.

Some 18 years may have elapsed between Collins’ departure as a player and his return as assistant manager but, to those old enough to remember, those flashes of brilliance are still inspirational.

‘When I was growing up, John was the player I looked up to,’ Mulgrew recalled. ‘He wore No 11 for Celtic and he was one of my heroes. I remember him scoring a free-kick at Ibrox. He was a great player and servant for Celtic. I’m sure everyone is delighted to have him back.’

New challenge: Mulgrew admits he knew little about new manager Delia before his arrival in Glasgow

Collins, who plied his trade at Monaco, Everton and Fulham after leaving Celtic in 1996, would have required no introductions to the vast majority of the players who gathered for pre-season training on Tuesday. Deila, by contrast, was a low-profile choice.

But if the name of the man who took unfashionable Stromsgodset to the Norwegian title prompted some frenzied internet research when he was first linked with Celtic, the impression he has made with the squad since they  reconvened has been overwhelmingly positive.

‘I didn’t know much about Ronny before he got the job,’ added Mulgrew. ‘I thought he came across really well and it has been the same meeting him.

‘We had a couple of meetings to get to know him and to get an idea of the way he wants to play. They were positive and everyone responded well. There are differences (from the last regime) but he is trying to get his ideas across.

‘I’m sure he has looked at some games and seen things we did well, but there will be things he will think we can improve upon. Hopefully, we can do well for him.’

It would be foolish to rush to judgment on the new regime. But there is no escaping how defining the forthcoming three Champions League qualifiers are.

Hurdle the three trip wires and the wind is in Deila’s sails. Come a cropper and there is no disguising the deflation.

KR Reykjavik present a testing but hardly ominous opening assignment in Iceland on July 15. Yet these are not unfamiliar tests for this crop of Celtic players.

Twice in succession now they have faced up to potentially treacherous ties in the middle of summer and have lived to tell the tale. Familiarity, Mulgrew hopes, will breed contentment.

‘It gives you experience and you know what you’re up against,’ he explained. ‘Last year, against Elfsborg, they were into their  season and you could see playing the game how much they wanted to be in the Champions League.

‘Karagandy away was difficult, a hostile atmosphere. Every team is scrapping to get there. It doesn’t matter about ability when a club wants it and the prize at the end is so big.’
