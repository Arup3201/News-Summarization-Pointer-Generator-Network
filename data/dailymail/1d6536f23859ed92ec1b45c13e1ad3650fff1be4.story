Kidnapping victim Michelle Knight has expressed her gratitude to Cleveland police following her harrowing ordeal in a handwritten note, which cops posted on Facebook on Wednesday evening.

Knight, held captive for more than 10 years, was the first woman captured by Ariel Castro before he went on to kidnap Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus.

In her note, Knight thanked the cops for their 'time and work' and expressed her resilience and determination to overcome everything she has gone through. 'Life is tough, but I'm tougher,' she wrote.

She also included the quote: 'Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, she became a butterfly.'

Over
the course of her imprisonment, Castro allegedly impregnated Knight 
five times and caused her to miscarry each time by starving and beating 
her.

Prosecutors revealed on Wednesday that all three women had kept diaries documenting the physical and sexual abuse they suffered on a daily basis.

Castro lured one of them into his Cleveland home with the promise of a puppy for her son and later locked all of them in a vehicle in his garage for three days when someone visited him, prosecutors said.

Former school bus driver Castro 
claimed he didn't have an exit strategy from his complicated double life
and finally gave the women a chance to escape by leaving a door 
unlocked, they said in court documents.

Amanda Berry broke free in May and called for help, frantically telling
an emergency dispatcher, ‘I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing 
for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here. I'm free now.’

Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder. He's being sentenced Thursday.

Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty says in a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday that Castro ‘remains remorseless for his actions.’

The memorandum says many of the charges in Castro's indictment reflect conduct documented by one of the women in her diary.

Ariel Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder and is due to be sentenced on Thursday

In the sentencing memorandum, prosecutors describe the horrific conditions the women endured. The women's diaries, they say, ‘document abuse and life as a captive.’

‘The entries speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war,’ the memorandum says.

When Castro was arrested, his attorneys said evidence would show he wasn't a monster. The county prosecutor says the facts he'll present Thursday at Castro's sentencing, at which Castro faces life in prison plus 1,000 years, will prove the lawyers wrong.

‘You'll make the same logical judgment when you see the facts,’ McGinty said last week after Castro pleaded guilty. ‘You have not seen the evidence yet.’

McGinty hasn't said whether the three women will testify in person. The legal team representing the women's interests declined to comment on whether they would testify or send statements to the court.

All three victims - Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus - appeared in a video in early July thanking the local community for its support

The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old.

There was no immediate comment Wednesday from Castro's defense team.

Many horrific details of the women's ordeal had already emerged, with one woman forced to wear a motorcycle helmet while chained in the basement and, after she tried to escape, having a vacuum cord wrapped around her neck.

He forced Knight on threat of death to safely deliver the child he fathered with Amanda Berry on Christmas Day 2006. That day, prosecutors say, Castro raped the woman who helped deliver his daughter.

Prosecutors will ask the judge to prohibit Castro from ever seeing his daughter, now 6.

McGinty says experts also will discuss the Stockholm syndrome to explain how Castro was able to keep the women captive for so long.

The indictment alleges he repeatedly restrained the women, sometimes chaining them to a pole in a basement, to a bedroom heater or inside a van and assaulting them with a vacuum cord if they tried to escape

The syndrome describes situations in which hostages and victims of abduction begin to sympathize with their captors and even defend them. It was named for a 1973 bank hostage situation in Stockholm, Sweden.

Castro so terrified the women that the day they were rescued, two of them were initially afraid to emerge even with five police officers in the house, McGinty said. When they did, they clung to police so tightly the officers couldn't use their flashlights, he said.

‘That told me what fear this man put into these women and how much courage it took to survive this ordeal,’ McGinty said.

He also referred to the ‘mental and physical bond and barrier’ that the first woman who escaped, Amanda Berry, had the courage to break.
