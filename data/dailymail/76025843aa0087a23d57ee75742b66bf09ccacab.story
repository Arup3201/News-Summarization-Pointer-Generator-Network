The North Sea helicopter crash that killed 16 men might have been avoided, a report has found.

Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle held a six-week inquiry after 14 oil workers and two crew died when a Bond Super Puma plunged into the water off the Aberdeenshire coast on April 1, 2009.

It found that Bond had failed to perform a task from the aircraft maintenance manual just days before on March 25 - after a metal particle was discovered on the helicopter's epicyclic chip detector.

Deaths: The 14 oil workers and two crew who died when a helicopter plunged into the water (top row, from left): James Costello, Vernon Elrick, Brian Barkley, Raymond Doyle, (second row, from left) Warren Mitchell, Gareth Hughes, David Rae, Nairn Ferrier, (third row, from left) Stuart Wood, Richard Menzies, James Edwards, Alex Dallas, (bottom row, from left) Leslie Taylor, Nolan Carl Goble, Paasul Burnham and Mihails Zuravskis

Bond also failed to ensure that communications with the manufacturer Eurocopter were done according to procedure, with the result that ‘misunderstandings arose between the parties’.

It also failed to identify what the metal particle was during maintenance, the report said. A witness had said how the helicopter fell from the sky ‘like a torpedo’, followed by its detached rotor blades.

An Air Accidents Investigation Branch probe found that the aircraft suffered a ‘catastrophic failure’ of its main rotor gearbox - and its ‘tail boom’ was severed from the fuselage.

The crash claimed the lives of captain and co-pilot Paul Burnham, 31, from Methlick in Aberdeenshire, and Richard Menzies, 24, from Droitwich Spa in Worcestershire.

Investigation: Wreckage from the helicopter being brought ashore after the Bond Super Puma plunged into the water off the Aberdeenshire coast in April 2009

Five men from Aberdeen died: Alex 
Dallas, 62, James Costello, 24, Stuart Wood, 27, Vernon Elrick, 41, and 
Brian Barkley, 30; and two workers were from Aberdeenshire: Leslie 
Taylor, 41, from Kintore, and Warren Mitchell, 38, from Oldmeldrum.

'The
 essential fact is that everyone in the company well knew that 
maintenance must be done by the book. On one occasion, that fundamental 
rule was broken'

Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle

The other victims were Raymond
 Doyle, 57, from Cumbernauld; David Rae, 63, from Dumfries; Gareth 
Hughes, 53, from Angus; Nairn Ferrier, 40, from Dundee; James Edwards, 
33, from Liverpool; Nolan Goble, 34, from Norwich; and Mihails 
Zuravskis, 39, from Latvia.

Many of those killed worked for KCA Deutag Drilling and were returning from BP's Miller platform at the time of the crash.

In
 his findings, Sheriff Pyle said: ‘The essential fact is that everyone 
in the company well knew that maintenance must be done by the book. On 
one occasion, that fundamental rule was broken.'

The families of the men who died have called for the Crown Office to review its decision not to pursue a criminal prosecution against Bond.

'No more families should have to go through what we have been through'

Audrey Wood, whose son Stuart died

Audrey Wood, who lost her son Stuart in the crash, said: ‘We, the families, feel let down by the system. We just wanted answers. We will never have closure, this will go on and on for us.

‘We are asking to meet with the Lord Advocate to try and convince him that the case against Bond helicopters needs to be looked at again.

‘No more families should have to go through what we have been through.’
