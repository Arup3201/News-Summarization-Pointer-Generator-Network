For children growing up with one of their parents in prison, trips to visit mom or dad behind bars can be costly and therefore rare.

Non-profit organization 'Get on the Bus' is working to strengthen these relationships between the incarcerated and their children by offering free buses for the kids to visit their parents in California prisons.

The most recent trip was organized last Saturday to Folsom State Prison, where the young children, hugged, kissed and played with their locked-up parents during visiting hours.

Bonding time: A non-profit organization is offering free transportation to children visiting their parents at California prisons. Above, Manuel Zarate hugs his daughter Brittany and grandson Andrew Almodovar at the end of a "Get On the Bus" visiting day to Folsom State Prison on July 26

Family: The 'Get on the Bus' visits are usually organized around holidays like Mother's Day or Father's Day. Above, Pharoah Haywood (right) plays with his daughter Isis, 2 (center), as his girlfriend Loretta Brown (left) looks on

The program is run by the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the Center for Restorative Justice Works 
(CRJW).

According to the program's website, the trips are usually organized around holidays such as Father's Day or Mother's Day.

Each visiting child is given a travel bag, photo of his or her parent and free meals for the entire day.

On the bus ride home, the kids are gifted a teddy bear and a letter from their parent and offered post-event counseling.

Happy: Tylan Gregory kisses his daughter as her mother Nicole Gregory  smiles nearby

Memories: The visiting children are provided free meals for the day and a picture of their parents for the bus ride back. Above, Pharaoh Haywood looks a photo of him and his girlfriend Loretta Brown during the visit

Precious: Haywood holds his daughter close on the special trip

Bittersweet: Richard Feliz comforts his son Noel, 13, who broke down into tears on the trip
