Lingerie giant Victoria's Secret has come under fire for 'sexualising' young girls with its latest underwear range which features thongs with the slogans 'call me' and 'I dare you' written across them.

Outraged parents have accused the group of portraying young teenage girls 'as sex objects' with the provocative designs.

The company insisted the collection was aimed at 'over 17s' but even its chief finance officer has suggested 15-year-old girls could wear the clothing range.

Too sexy for teens? Victoria's Secret's Bright Young Things campaign for its PINK collection has sparked anger from parents who claim it is targeting younger children

Speaking at a conference to publicise
the Pink collection, Stuart Burgdoerfer reportedly said: 'When 
somebody’s 15 or 16 years old, what do they want to be? They want to be 
older, and they want to be cool like the girl in college, and that’s 
part of the magic of what we do at Pink.'

This is despite Victoria's Secret 
claiming it released the line to coincide with America's college 
student's spring break - gearing it towards 17 and 18-year-olds.

Parenting website Netmums said Mr Burgdoefer's statement will astonish parents.

Siobhan Freegard, from Netmums.com, said: 'Victoria's Secret is a brand built on selling sex. From the world famous raunchy fashion shows to neon bright colours and the skimpiest designs on the high street, the company has always promoted its products as overtly sexual.

'So for a top boss to claim the new teens range is designed to make underage girls look and feel older is a major marketing mistake which will horrify parents.

'There is enough pressure on young girls to grow up far too fast without clothing firms telling them they have to look like sexy adults while they are still in school. I wonder if the firm's bosses would be comfortable with their own child wearing this?'

The provocative new line - advertised
under the motto Bright Young Things - has appalled parents who claim 
the company is 'sexualising' their daughters.

Inappropriate: Mr Burgdoefer claimed the range's 'magic' was helping 15-year-olds to feel older with its designs, such as this pink and orange thong with the slogan 'call me'

On the wild side: Angry parents claims the range and 'Bright Young Things' advertising campaign portrays teens as sexual objects

Many took to the company’s Facebook 
page to express their anger at the firm which uses top models Miranda 
Kerr and Candice Swanepoel in its advertising campaigns.

There is even a petition demanding 
that the advertising campaign be withdrawn and that the Bright Young 
Things line not target teenagers at all.

In a letter on ForceChange.org to 
Victoria's Secret CEO Lori Greeley, it is accused of hiring 'younger 
looking teen models who are scantily clad and provocatively posed'.

It also objects to the slogan 'Bright Young Things' because it 'refers to young women as "things."'

It read: 'By choosing to target 
teenagers with your new line, you are condoning teen sexuality and 
portraying teens as sexual objects.'

Victoria's Secret responded to the 
complaints with a statement on its Facebook page, insisting that it has 
no plans to launch a line for girls not old enough to attend college.

'In response to questions we recently
received, Victoria’s Secret PINK is a brand for college-aged women,' it
read. 'Despite recent rumors, we have no plans to introduce a 
collection for younger women.

'"Bright Young Things" was a slogan used in conjunction with the college spring break tradition.'

Despite the company's assurances, hundreds of parents are threatening to boycott the chain.

One commenter wrote: 'You are selling
out a generation of young women to make a buck with your "Bright Young 
Things" line. It is irresponsible and disgusting to market that level of
sexually suggestive items to girls. As an adult, I will no longer be 
shopping in your store.' 

Another wrote: 'You already do enough
to undermine real woman's and young ladies self esteem - now you want 
further sexualize our daughters [sic].'

And one women admitted to being a longtime fan of the brand, yet refuses to shop there any longer.

'I have shopped regularly at 
Victoria's Secret for a decade and will no longer be supporting your 
business,' she wrote. 'It's a shame because I love your product, but I 
cannot support a company that seeks to sexualize children.'

But not everyone is unhappy with the new offerings in the PINK range.

Earlier this month, a conservative 
mommy blogger shocked fellow parents by admitting that she has no 
problem with her nine-year-old shopping at Victoria's Secret.

Jenny Erikson, from San Diego, 
California, sparked fierce debate on parenting site The Stir, when wrote
that she didn't want daughter Hannah 'to be the girl with the ugly 
underwear' at camp or slumber parties.

She later told Good Morning America: 
'I don't think there's anything wrong with having cute panties and bras 
from the big girl store.'

But many other mothers took issue 
with her decision, arguing that the lingerie giant is 'too sexy', 'not 
intended for children', and that Mrs Erikson is at risk of 
oversexualizing the youngster at too young an age.

One commenter on the GMA website 
wrote: 'It's one thing to get your daughter cute, bright colored, fun 
underthings, but Victoria's Secret is geared for sexy, not cute.'

Another wrote on The Stir: 'Are you 
people serious? She is nine years old. I have four girls and as long as 
they are under my roof, I will not allow such clothing. Sexy is for 
ADULTS.'
