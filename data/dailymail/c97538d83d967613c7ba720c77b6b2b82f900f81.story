A Texas teenager jailed since February after threatening to 'shoot up a school' on Facebook, has been released from prison after an anonymous donor posted a $500,000 bail bond.

Justin Carter,  now 19, was arrested after he got into an argument with someone over a multiple player online video game on the social networking site.

Officers swooped after they were tipped off about his online comments, in which he wrote:  'I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their 
still beating hearts'.

But now he has been released after a mystery benefactor wired the money to his legal representation.

He is now planning to stay near New Braunfels, Texas, to await his trial on a felony terroristic threat charge, NPR.org reports. If convicted he could face eight years in jail.

Don Flanary, Carter's attorney, told the site: 'He's glad he's out. His family is ecstatic. He feels good. He is relieved. It's been an ordeal.'

Justin's father, Jack Carter, has previously said that his son had clearly made the comments in jest.

Although the teenager, who turned 19 while in prison, added 'lol' (laughing out loud) and 'jk' (just kidding) to his post, a woman from Canada who saw it reported Justin to police after finding out that he lived near an elementary school.

Mr Carter has since been campaigning to have his son released, and wants to teach teenagers about the dangers of posting comments on social media.

'Justin was the kind of kid who didn't read the newspaper. He didn't watch television. He wasn't aware of current events. These kids, they don't realize what they're doing. They don't understand the implications. They don't understand public space,' he told KHOU.

His son first got into trouble in February after he and a friend had been playing League of Legends.

Mr Carter said: 'Someone had said something to the effect of "Oh you're insane, you're crazy, you're messed up in the head," to which he replied "Oh yeah, I'm real messed up in the head, I'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still, beating hearts.'

He added that his son had made it clear that the comment was made in jest.

A woman in Canada contacted the police after a Google search showed Justin's last known address was close to Wooldridge Elementary School in Austin and he was arrested.

His comments were made just two months after the Sandy Hook Tragedy in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza fatally shot twenty children and six adult staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the village of Sandy Hook in Newtown, Connecticut.

The mass murder has raised renewed debate about America's gun control laws
