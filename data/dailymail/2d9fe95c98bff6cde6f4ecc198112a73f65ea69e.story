A 28-year-old Melbourne man handed himself into police late on Thursday in relation to the assault of two schoolgirls

A 28-year-old Melbourne man handed himself into police late on Thursday in relation to the assault of two schoolgirls on a packed tram in Melbourne's CBD last month.

The man of Maidstone, north west of the CBD, was later charged with two counts of indecent assault, a Victorian Police spokeswoman said.

He has been bailed to appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on November 10.

A man had been wanted for questioning after he allegedly assaulted two year 11 schoolgirls on the busy vehicle around 3.30pm on Friday June 20, according to Victorian Police.

After the attack the 17-year-olds snapped photos of a man on their mobile phones and the same individual was also caught on CCTV footage.

Detectives on Thursday released still images and CCTV footage of the man wanted over the assault, which occurred as the tram passed through the Domain Interchange on St Kilda road.

Victoria Police previoulsy released a statement in their appeal for information about the incident.

'The girls were travelling together on the same tram, when a man came up behind them and indecently assaulted them,' the statement said.

'He is perceived to be Indian, 30-40 years of age with a medium build, brown eyes and short dark hair.'

Detective Senior Constable Sean Campbell told AAP the victims, both teenage schoolgirls, were on the tram together when a man targeted one girl.

When she moved away from him he then focused on the second girl.

Both girls left the tram immediately, and Detective Campbell said other schoolgirls on the tram were quick to act.

'We've met with the schools in the area to devise a plan, should this behaviour occur to the girls, on what action to take, and on this occasion they performed flawlessly and took some very good stills of the male which will allow us, hopefully, to identify him and speak to him about what occurred,' he said.

The man left the train when it got to Flinders Street Station but his movements after that are unknown.

The assault happened on a packed Melbourne train at the end of last month

Officers applauded the young girls for their quick thinking in snapping the shots

Detective Campbell told The Age the man’s conduct on the tram was 'no doubt concerning'.

'To say its not publicly acceptable would be an understatement,' he said.

'In the nature of the business I’m in it's not the first time I’ve seen something like this and I suspect not going to be the last.'
