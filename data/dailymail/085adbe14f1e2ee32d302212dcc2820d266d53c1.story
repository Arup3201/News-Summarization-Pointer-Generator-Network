Shoppers hankering after the latest smartphones, tablets and televisions touting super-sharp displays might want to think about twice before buying into the high resolution trend, after experts said humans are paying for more pixels than they can see.

New ‘Ultra HD’ or 4K televisions have four times as many pixels and a higher price tag than an ordinary HD TV, but in many cases, the human eye cannot notice the difference, they said.

As manufacturers compete to create products with the highest number of pixels per inch (PPI) they are creating densities that surpass the limits of the human eye.

The 'world's first' 84 inch Ultra HD TV, on sale at Peter Jones department store, London. Sych televisions have four times as many pixels than an ordinary HD TV, but in many cases, the human eye cannot notice the difference, experts have said

Raymond Soneira, head of display-testing firm DisplayMate, told NBC News that when it comes to Ultra HD technology ‘a regular human isn’t going to see a difference’.

The TVs by Sony and Samsung have a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 – four times that of a standard HD or ‘retina’ television and cost between £1,840 ($3,000) and £15,320 ($25,000), with both companies claiming the sets offer a superior viewing experience.

As manufacturers compete to provide the highest number of pixels per inch they are often creating densities that surpass the limits of the human eye

Similarly, the PPIs for some smartphones have also jumped and the HTC One and LG G2, for example, have screens with over 400 PPI.

However, Don Hood, a professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University, said: ‘There's going to be some density beyond which you can't do any better because of the limits of your eye.’

He explained that a person’s field of vision usually covers 200 degrees - a little bit more than a semicircle – and if you hold your arm away from your body, your fingernail measures roughly one of those degrees.

Now if you imagine your fingernail is covered with 120 alternating stripes, being able to see them is around the limit of the human eye working at its very best.

He said that the perceived quality of a screen depends on how far away it is positioned from a viewer, so a difference in resolution for a TV set is not usually noticeable unless it is incredibly large or close to people.

Dr Bryan Jones of the University of Utah said he does not see the point of technology with incredible resolutions, while Mr Soneira said there is a bigger case for working on 3D technology than 4K.

The new Ultra HD screens have a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 - four times that of a standard HD television and cost between $3,000 and $25,000. Pictured are pixels from outdated TVs sold from around 1970 to 1994

‘Consumers will soon realise that they 
aren't seeing much, if any visual resolution and sharpness 
improvements, ‘ said Mr Soneira.

He believes ‘quantum dot’ technology might be the next big thing for TV and smartphone displays as it focuses on improving colour representation and contrast.

Michel Landy, a neuroscientist at New York University, believes progress will come in the form of screens that show more realistic light and shadow.

‘When you're in a scene where there's indoor stuff, outdoor stuff, glossy materials reflecting other lights [...] that dynamic range is huge,’ he said, but ‘consumer-grade displays don't get that stuff right,' he said.
