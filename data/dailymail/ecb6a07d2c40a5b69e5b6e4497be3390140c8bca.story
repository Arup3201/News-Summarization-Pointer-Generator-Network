A married undercover cop in Arizona began an affair with the drug dealer she was investigating only to out herself and two other colleagues while the pair lay in bed according to a police report.

Tempe Police Detective Jessica Dever-Jakusz, 38, met her drug-dealer lover in June of 2013 after buying narcotics from him undercover and by August she was having regular sex with him at his home.

But on October 10th, after one of their trysts, Dever-Jakusz - who is married to a police officer - revealed that she was working undercover to arrest him at the same time as betraying her colleagues' identities.

Undercover: The Maricopa County Attorney's Office is reviewing a Tempe police report that alleges Jessica Dever-Jakusz engaged in an affair with a suspected drug-dealer while undercover

An anonymous tip to police led to the unidentified suspect being brought in for questioning on October 15th where he admitted to a sexual relationship with the 13-year force veteran and revealed explicit text messages he exchanged with Dever-Jakusz - including one in which she was asking to come to his house that day.

The affair ruined a five-month-long undercover investigation into the sale of MDMA in Tempe, which is nicknamed Molly.

The police report was released after a public information request and was heavily redacted.

Included in the report was the statement made by Dever-Jakusz's lover who said that he was stunned when she told him she was a police officer actively trying to send him to prison.

'Up until that time, the suspect did not know or ever suspected that Dever-Jakusz was a police officer, the report said

According to the suspect she was supposed to be investigating, Dever-Jakusz initially lied she was married and then when she revealed all, told him that her husband was a Chandler police officer, but that they had been having marital issues.

During her confession, she told the drug dealer suspect that her husband had been 'looking up a bunch of stuff on him,' according to USA Today.

And that she suspected his motivation for doing this was 'for other than a legitimate purpose as a law-enforcement officer.'

Chandler Police confirmed last week that the husband, Officer Garrett Dever is now the subject of an internal-affairs investigation and is married to Jessica Dever-Jakusz, but did not elaborate.

It is not known if Dever-Jakusz's husband was aware or suspected the affair before she made her startling confession.

However, police sources told Arizona network KPHO that the investigation involved Dever using police computers to look up a subject he believed his wife was having an affair with and then threatening that man.Â 

The police report said Dever-Jakusz's revelations to the drug suspect on Oct. 10 severely damaged a five-month undercover investigation by at least three detectives into the sale of the drug called "Molly"

Police sent a report last week to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office recommending that she be charged with two counts of hindering prosecution.

A spokesman said last week that the case is under review.

A Tempe police spokesman declined Tuesday to provide contact information for Dever-Jacusz and a spokesman for the County Attorney's Office couldn't immediately say whether Dever-Jakusz has a lawyer.

Tempe Police Chief Tom Ryff sent a memo last week to employees confirming Dever-Jakusz's resignation. His memo revealed that the case had been referred for possible prosecution but didn't elaborate.

The Tempe report says no drug charges can be filed against the suspect with whom Dever-Jakusz had the relationship and it's unknown if any charges could move forward against other suspects from the undercover operation.
