The Ford Fiesta has become the best selling car of all time in the UK with sales topping 4.1 million in the past 38 years.

It has overtaken the Ford Escort, the previous record holder, to become the most popular model among British drivers.

When it was launched in 1976 the Ford Fiesta cost just £1,865, compared to £12,495 for the best-selling Zetec model.

Ford yesterday announced the record with news that the number of Fiesta’s registered in the UK topped 4,115,000, compared to the Escort’s total sales figure of 4,105,961 over 32 years.

Since its launch, the Fiesta has led the small car segment in the UK for 27 of the 37 years and has been Britain’s best-selling car since 2009 when it overtook the Ford Focus.

Mark Ovenden, head of Ford Britain, said: 'The Ford Fiesta has gone from strength to strength and today’s car combines style, value, driving dynamics and remarkable technologies such as the multi-award-winning 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine.

'It continues to outsell its nearest retail competitor by more than two to one - and that really tells the story of this extraordinary car.'

Ford said the technical progress since the original Fiesta was introduced has been staggering.

For example, it would now take more than 80 modern-day Fiestas to generate the same nitrus oxide emissions of a single 1976 Mk1 model. 

This first-generation Fiesta, with the 46bhp four-cylinder 950cc petrol engine, weighed around 800kg and achieved 37.7mpg.

Today a 1.0 litre Fiesta is more than a third heavier, but achieves nearly 66mpg.

More than 40 per cent of Fiesta buyers in the UK today choose the turbo-charged 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine, and almost 90 per cent opt for higher level specification - Zetec, Zetec S, Titanium, Titanium X and ST models with the Ford SYNC voice-controlled connectivity system. 

The most popular Ford Fiesta series in Britain is the Zetec, priced at £12,945, and features remote central locking, electric windows and door mirrors, air conditioning and seven airbags.

Fiesta models are developed in Dunton, Essex, while engines are assembled in Dagenham, Essex, and Bridgend, south Wales. Cars destined for the UK market are built in Germany and Spain.
