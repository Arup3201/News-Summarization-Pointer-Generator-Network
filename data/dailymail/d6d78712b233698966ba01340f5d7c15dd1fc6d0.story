Eight educational and conservation projects in California's Big Sur area will get $1.4 million from a settlement reached with ex-Facebook president Sean Parker — and he'll also have to perform an unusual and high-tech sort of community service.

The California Coastal Commission and Parker  reached a $2.5 million settlement after the Napster co-founder failed to obtain permits for his lavish $10 million wedding in an ecologically sensitive area of Big Sur. 

Parker, 33 — who married singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas, 24 in June — has agreed to create a mapping app to help beach-goers navigate the tricky routes around private properties in the area, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. 

Sean Parker's lavish $10 million wedding to Alexandra Lenas landed him a $2.5 million fine after he failed to obtain permits for the event, which took place in an ecologically sensitive area of Big Sur

California's coastline is all public, but visitors at times find it difficult to know where local lands end and private property begins.

'We’re now working with his technical team, which is orders of magnitude beyond what we would be able to summon in terms of technical expertise within our agency,” spokeswoman Sarah Christie, of the California Coastal Commission, told the newspaper.

'It was a creative resolution ... that will ultimately benefit public access,' she added.

About $345,000 will go to the San Francisco-based Save the Redwoods League, which will rebuild a section of the popular Pfeiffer Falls Trail after afire damaged it in 2008, according to the Chronicle.

Grants will range from $75,000 to more than $340,000 to increase public access to Big Sur and help marginalized families on field trips to the area.

Some of the money will support several local groups for at-risk youth. 

The rest will pay for fines against the Ventanna inn and Spa, where the wedding was hosted.

'This was a creative, collaborative way to resolve a Coastal Act violation, and we are pleased that the Parkers are committed to supporting the good work of these important organizations,' said Charles Lester, the executive director of the Coastal Commission, in a statement.

Photographs released by the California government have shown the over-the-top stone bridge, fake ruins and waterfalls  Parker illegally constructed in the ancient redwoods of Big Sur for his $10 million fairytale wedding. 

The images, contained in California Coastal Commission documents, show Parker allegedly built a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dancefloor in the ecologically sensitive area near ancient redwoods and a stream with endangered steelhead trout.

He also allegedly built a gateway and arch, an artificial pond, a stone bridge, multiple event platforms with elevated floors, rock walls and fake ruined castle walls.

And despite the fact the wedding venue was already in a forest, he allegedly planted 125 trees and other plants and flowers.

In some pictures, the movie-like set appears to damage the beloved redwoods. Others appear to show a bulldozer moving dirt and materials around the forest floor.

In one image, a bridge created from stones and lined with plants is seen with port-a-potties scattered around.

Parker allegedly had exclusive use of the campground for several months to construct the wedding venue, all without any coastal development permits. 

Officials were tipped off about Parker's lavish $10 million wedding construction when neighbors complained, prompting a county investigation into the construction.

When staff inspected, they found the temporary structures had already been built, but allowed the wedding to proceed anyway.

The commission started negotiating a settlement with Parker and his representatives for the violations instead of shutting the event down.
