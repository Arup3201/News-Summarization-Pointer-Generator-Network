It’s being called ‘the Champions against the Champions’ as European Cup holders Real Madrid and La Liga conquerors Atletico Madrid get ready to face each other in the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.

Cristiano Ronaldo is back from two weeks rest, Gareth Bale is fresh from scoring twice for Wales, and despite the fact that Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas were sharing jokes with Atletico rivals Koke and Juanfran on Wednesday night as they watched Spain crash out of the Basketball World Cup together, the rivals are ready to rumble again on Saturday just three weeks after they clashed in a heated Spanish Super Cup double header.

Both sides’ managers have seen their trophy winning teams partially dismantled this summer – Atletico by necessity and Real by presidential whim. In the rebuilding stakes, Carlo Ancelotti seems to be trailing Diego Simeone.

Cristiano Ronaldo returns for Real Madrid after a two week rest during the international break

Real Madrid have lost Angel di Maria to Manchester United in a £60million move 

He has lost the energy of Angel Di Maria from his midfield three and is still contemplating moving Gareth Bale back there to compensate. 

The alternative is to persist with new man James Rodriguez alongside Toni Kroos and Luka Modric but the Colombian does not have the engine that Di Maria had and Ancelotti feels it makes for a midfield trio that leaves its defence exposed.

Atletico also lost players in the summer but Simeone’s formation and tactics remain largely unchanged. Siqueira replaces Felipe Luis, Miguel Angel Moya replaces Thibaut Courtois in goal, and Mario Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann replace Diego Costa – yes it’s taken two men for that job: Mandzukic to get the goals and Greizmann to stretch teams with his pace and provide the quick out ball for his team-mates.

Behind them Atletico remain the same rock solid two-banks of four team they were last season and they have also lost none of their efficiency from set-plays.

Three of their last four goals have been scored from a set-piece including Raul Garcia’s strike from a Koke corner as Atletico drew the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid 1-1.

Ancelotti is well aware of the threat and saw his team defend poorly against Real Sociedad losing 4-2 before the international break.

He will want greater concentration and possibly a better aerial presence, which is why an injury to right-back Dani Carvajal is not the worst possible news.

Atletico don't seem to have been too unsettled by the loss of last season's stars such as Thibaut Courtois   

Diego Simeone was given an eight-match ban for conduct in Spanish Super Cup last month

It will give Ancelotti the chance to put Sergio Ramos at right back and bring Raphael Varane – excellent for France against Spain’s Diego Costa last week – into the centre of defence.

Fabio Coentrao will be the other change at the back, coming in for Marcelo who has just returned from a 9,000 mile round trip from Madrid to the US for two friendlies in which he didn’t play a single minute.

‘These derbies are more evenly balanced than they used to be’ says Atletico Madrid full-back Juanfran. ‘Real Madrid supporters look at us differently these days’. For 14 years Atletico failed to beat their wealthier neighbours but Diego Simeone has drastically changed the football landscape in the Spanish capital.

And don’t let any Atletico Madrid fans hear you say: ‘Yes but are they a wonder season wonder?’ It was TWO years ago that Atletico beat Real in the Spanish Cup final and at the end of that season their ability to ‘go again’ was questioned. ‘Go again’ they did, winning not the cup but the league itself.

As reigning champions and having started the season without the doubts that seem to be affecting Real, they will not be intimidated in the Santiago Bernabeu – despite the 81,000 cauldron that awaits them. 

Their measly allocation of 250 tickets continues to be taken up slowly so there will be no red and white wall of noise and neither will Atletico have Simeone prowling the touchline. After clipping the fourth official round the back of the head in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup he is still serving part of his eight-match ban.

His assistant German Burgos will take his place and like his superior he is no stranger to derbies having played in goal for Atletico for four years. 

He saved a Figo penalty with his nose in the 2003 meeting at the Bernabeu and then conceded one of the fixture’s fastest goals a season later when he was beaten by Ronaldo after 14 seconds.

The other Ronaldo – Cristiano – is winding himself up ready to be unleashed on the Champions. Kept out of Real Madrid’s 4-2 defeat to Real Sociedad and Portugal’s miserable week of international woe, he returns to the team and can edge closer to a few more Madrid milestones.

He has scored 255 goals in 250 games for Madrid including 178 times in La Liga. 

There are only three players between him and all-time club top scorer status with leader Raul just 68 goals ahead – having played 11 seasons more.

No wonder when asked if he was worried about the team’s poor start to the season this week Ancelotti told Italy’s Il Giornale: 'I can rest safe in the knowledge that we have two very important things: a group of very professional players, and Ronaldo who scores a goal a game.'
