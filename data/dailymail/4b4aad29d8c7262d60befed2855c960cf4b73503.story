An earthquake in New Zealand on Monday shook loose a giant eagle sculpture promoting 'The Hobbit' movie trilogy and caused other minor damage around the region.

The magnitude 6.3 quake struck the country's lower North Island at a little before 4pm and rattled the capital of Wellington.

Many residents of the city were at home because it was a public holiday.

Victim: An eagle sculpture promoting the second installment of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit fell at Wellington Airport after an earthquake hit New Zealand's north island Monday afternoon

Shook up: According to initial reports, no major damage or injuries were reported in the 6.3 earthquake - besides the unhinged giant eagle

Steadfast: Yellow tape marks off the space around the other eagle sculpture which remained in position during the quake

Impact zone: The quake centered on New Zealand's north Island was strong enough to damage some homes, trigger rock slides and cause road closures

There were no initial reports of major damage or injuries, although the quake was strong enough to damage some homes, trigger rockslides and road closures, and knock items from shelves.

The eagle sculpture in the Wellington Airport was placed there in recent months to promote director Peter Jackson's second movie in his popular trilogy.

It fell from its overhead perch to the floor.

The United States Geological Survey 
estimated the quake was centered about 24 miles northeast of the town of
 Masterton at a depth of 17 miles.

New
 Zealand lies on the Pacific's 'Ring of Fire,' an arc of earthquake and 
volcanic activity that stretches around the Pacific Rim.

An earthquake in the city of Christchurch in 2011 destroyed much of the downtown and killed 185 people.
