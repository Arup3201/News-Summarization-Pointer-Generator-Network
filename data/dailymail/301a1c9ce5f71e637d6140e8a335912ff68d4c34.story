Dangerous games: Sgt Matthew Gallagher, 22, died of a gunshot to the head on an army base in Iraq

A soldier, who died after a colleague allegedly shot him at point-blank range during a game of 'quick draw', was warned not to play the game two days before.

Sergeant Matthew Gallagher, 22, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head while serving at his base in Al-Kut, Iraq on June 26 last year.

Sgt Brent McBride, 25, was initially charged with murder over the death of Sgt Gallagher from Falmouth, Massachussetts.

However following a hearing in Texas last month no further legal proceedings were set for McBride, an army source told msnbc.com, but the military would carry out its own investigation.

Sgt Gallagher's widow Katie, 23, and his mother Cheryl Ruggiero spoke for the first time this week to the Boston Globe about the investigation in December - and had many unanswered questions.

In the weeks following his death, his wife 
and mother came to believe he had died in action. 

Reports from the investigation in Texas 
last month said that Sgt Gallagher pointed his gun at Sgt McBride, saying: 'What would you do now?'

It is then believed that McBride drew his own gun and pointed it at Gallagher’s head before firing the fatal shot.

The lawyer for McBride said at the time 
it was a 'tragic accident', and he did not know the 9mm pistol came to be loaded, 
according to the Cape Cod Times.

Mrs Ruggerio, 53, who is suspicious of McBride's account, told the Boston Globe: 'He did take someone’s life. You can say
it was a horrible accident, but he knew, as a soldier, with his 
training, it’s not something you do. You don’t pick up a gun and put it 
to someone’s head.’

Demanding answers: Sgt Gallagher's widow, Katie, 23, and mother Cheryl Ruggiero, from Falmouth, Massachussets still have questions about their loved one's death

McBride was initially charged with 
murder but an Army spokesman at Fort Hood, Texas, told msnbc.com that no
further legal proceedings are set 'pending a review' by the Army. It is
not clear whether the soldier will be court-martialled.

Sources said that several soldiers and at least one higher-ranking staff sergeant warned them against playing the game.

The death of 22-year-old Sgt Gallagher remains under investigation. Meanwhile, McBride remains on active duty at Fort Hood, according to the Cape Cod Times.
