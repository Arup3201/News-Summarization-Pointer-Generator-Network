England and Saracens rugby star Owen Farrell's great uncle Francis was killed with a single punch

The great uncle of England rugby star Owen Farrell was battered to death over a cigarette as he walked home to celebrate Father's Day.

Dad of one Francis Farrell, 56, was left to die in a pool of blood by 23-year old David Horner who had been earlier pestering passers-by for a smoke.

Mr Farrell told Horner he had no cigarettes and tried to walk on but was punched in the face causing him to fall and hit his head on the kerb.

Yesterday
Horner, of Scholes, near Wigan, Greater Manchester was sentenced to three years and four months at Liverpool Crown Court after admitting manslaughter.

He was traced after
police trawled CCTV footage.

Owen, 21, has appeared for both England rugby league and union international teams and plays for Saracens in the Aviva Premiership.

The England number ten kicked 17 points in the 38-21 victory over New Zealand this month.

He was recently nominated for the IRB Player of the Year Award - marking him out as one of the four best players in the sport.

Francis Farrell - known to friends as 'Fran' - was found unconscious on the pavement by a passing taxi driver with his teeth broken.

He died three days later in hospital from fatal head injuries without regaining consciousness.

The victim had been drinking in 
various pubs within Wigan, Greater Manchester into the early hours of 
Fathers Day on Sunday 17 June this year.

He
was last seen leaving Wiend Bar in Wigan town centre at about 3.50am 
wearing a black fleece jacket, light blue jeans, black shoes, and a 
black hat.

He was then seen on CCTV walking down Frog Lane at 3.58am.

Horner and a friend had been celebrating a birthday in Wigan town centre when they ran out of money.

They left and walked the short distance to an address just off Frog Lane to pick up some extra cash.

On their way back Horner became separated from his friend and started to pester passersby for a cigarette.

His friend heard a noise and turned to see Horner running towards him and a man lying in the road.

Mr Farrell was found a short 
time later unconscious by a passing taxi driver who called an ambulance.
Post mortem tests revealed he died from head injuries.

The dead man's nephew - and Owen's father - is Andy Farrell OBE.

The 37-year-old former Great Britain Lions captain and won the Golden Boot as the best player in the world in 2004.

He is currently coach for the England rugby union team and helped mastermind their historic defeat of the New Zealand All Blacks.

Former Wigan Warrior forward, Andy, captained his club to several championships and Challenge Cup titles as well as a range of individual awards between 1991 and 2004.

In 2001 Farrell set the Wigan club's record for most points in a season with 429. He is only the second player to score more than 3,000 points in all competitions at Wigan.

He transferred to rugby union and played for the Saracens from 2005 to 2009 and won eight England caps.

Greater Manchester Police said the main focus of the investigation centred on CCTV, with officers trawling through hundreds of hours of footage from various locations, which led to the arrest of Horner and his friend on Tuesday 10 July 2012.

Horner made no comment in police interview. A 22 year old suspect was eliminated from enquiries.

After the case Det Chief Insp Phil Reade said: 'Francis was attacked in the early hours of Sunday 17 June whilst minding his own business on his way home after enjoying a night out in Wigan town centre.

'Horner, desperate for a cigarette, carried out a totally unprovoked attack which ended in tragedy.

'He left Francis lying in the road, unconscious and seriously injured and carried on with his night out as though nothing had happened.

'Francis' family and friends have been left devastated and are still finding it hard to come to terms with his loss.'

The victim's family said: 'We as a family cannot understand why this senseless tragedy has happened.

'Our Francis, or better known as 'France' to his friends, was a good son, brother and uncle. He kept himself to himself and was a quiet person.

'Francis lived his life how he wished and would cause no harm to anyone.

'He will be sadly missed by all his friends and family. Words cannot describe how this brutal killing has affected all of us around him. As a youngster, he grew up in Scholes and later the family moved to Beech Hill.

'Francis was the kind of person who when he made friends, they were to be his lifelong friends.

'As a young lad he loved participating in team sports. As he grew older, he liked a pint and enjoyed a good night out, like the majority of us do. Sadly, this is when his life came to a shocking end.

'We would also like to thank everyone for everything that was done for Francis whilst he was in hospital and for the many cards and thoughts of condolence that we have received.

'Francis son and grandson have both said how much they are missing him.'

Farrell, 22, is presently a second row player for the Wigan Warriors in 
the European Super League.
