Kellie Maloney stopped breathing for more than an hour during facial reconstruction surgery and was kept alive on an emergency respirator, it has been reported.

Maloney, formerly fight promoter Frank Maloney, shocked the world of boxing when it was revealed in August she was undergoing a sex change but, 18 months into the transition, she is believed to have suffered a heart murmur triggered by a reaction to the anaesthetic she was under.

Maloney's final operation was scheduled for January 13 but it is understood medics have cancelled the genital and breast surgery, warning it is too dangerous.

A source told the The Sun: 'She can't go ahead with the sex change now. She's in utter turmoil.'

Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change.

Maloney already received hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. Her final operation was for 'the realignment of her male genitalia to become female genitalia' as well as having breast implants.

Eleven days ago, Maloney travelled to Belgium to undergo facial surgery but she is said to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic which meant she could not breathe on her own. 

She is now recovering with her family in Maidstone, Kent. MailOnline has contacted Ms Maloney's representatives for comment.
