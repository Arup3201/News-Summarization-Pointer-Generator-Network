An NSA employee who gave Edward Snowden his passwords in order to access classified information has resigned after the agency stripped him of his security clearance.

Two others- one member of the military and one contractor- have both been banned from NSA facilities after being 'implicated' for helping Snowden.

NBC News reports that the National Security Agency has launched an internal inquiry into Snowden and the way in which he was able to collect classified information while working as a consultant before releasing it publicly and causing an international debate over surveillance procedures.

None of the individuals have been named, but the civilian employee who has been fired was apparently used as a way for Snowden to gain greater access to agency information.

Trickery: A new memo finds that a civilian NSA employee logged into Snowden's computer at the hacker's request but didn't realize he was able to record his keystrokes and used the password at a later date

The unclassified memo, which was sent to both the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees on February 10, states that Snowden once asked the person to log into their account on Snowden's computer.

'Unbeknownst to the civilian, Mr Snowden was able to capture the password, allowing him even greater access to classified information,' the memo states according to NBC.

This new report comes in contrast to what Snowden and some of his other former colleagues have described.

Snowden, whose days are numbered under his temporary asylum status in Russia, previously claimed that he never deceived colleagues or used their passwords without them knowing.

Defending their tactics: General Keith Alexander testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on December 11 saying that at the time they had three cases they were reviewing

He also said that in the rare instances where colleagues asked him to log in for them for whatever reason- for instance, if they were on holiday- he said he never used those opportunities to dig deeper into classified NSA data.

The civilian employee may have been duped into giving his password to Snowden, the memo says that it still shows that they 'failed to comply with security obligations'.

The civilian is the only one of the three to resign at this point, while the other two are having their cases reviewed by their superiors.

No further details about the contractor and military member's involvement, or what prompted their credentials to be revoked.

Ironic fashion statement: Snowden apparently wore a sweatshirt just like this one to work at the NSA and his colleagues thought it was just a funny fashion choice rather than a warning sign

The memo comes almost two months to the day since the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings with NSA Director General Keith Alexander.

At the time, he said that they were 'currently reviewing' three cases. There has been no official confirmation that the three cases mentioned in this week's memo were the three that Alexander was referring to.

If they are, however, it also does not make the timeline clear as to when the civilian resigned and when the other two were barred from NSA facilities in relation to both the December 11 hearing and the February 10 memo release.
