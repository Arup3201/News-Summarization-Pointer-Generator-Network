The earliest surviving intact European book, which lay buried in a saint's coffin for hundreds of years, has been bought by the British Library for £9million.

The seventh century St Cuthbert Gospel is on show at the library in King's Cross, north London.

It was purchased and saved for the nation after a multimillion-pound fundraising effort.

Europe's earliest book: The seventh century St Cuthbert Gospel lay buried in a saint's coffin for hundreds of years and has now been bought by the British Library for £9million

Time capsule: The book was produced in the north of England in the late seventh century

St Cuthbert was born circa 634 in Northumbria and is regarded as one of the most important medieval saints in England.

He was inspired to become a monk, and later a bishop, after spotting a vision in the night sky while working as a shepherd in 651.

St Aidan, the founder of Lindisfarne, died that same night - Cuthbert immediately vowed to follow a monastic path.

He was a monk at Melrose Abbey between 651 to 664, after which he became prior at Lindisfarne until 676.

In 684, he became bishop of Lindisfarne but resigned in late 686 as he thought he was on the verge of dying.

He was buried at Lindisfarne Prior in 687 before his coffin was moved to Durham Cathedral to escape Viking raiders.

Dame Lynne Brindley, the British 
Library's chief executive, said: 'This was a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity to secure the Gospel for the nation and we were both 
grateful and touched that so many people felt moved to support our 
campaign.'

The
 book was produced in the north of England in the late seventh century 
and buried alongside St Cuthbert, an early English Christian leader, on 
the island of Lindisfarne off the coast of Northumberland in around 
AD698.

The coffin was moved
 off the island to escape Viking raiders and taken to Durham, where the 
book, which is a copy of the Gospel of St John, was found when the 
coffin was opened at the cathedral in 1104. Its original red leather 
binding survives today.

In the beginning was the word: The first page of the St Cuthbert Gospel, a remarkably preserved palm-sized book which is a manuscript copy of the Gospel of John in Latin

The single largest contribution to 
the campaign was a £4.5million grant from the National Heritage Memorial
 Fund but there were also donations from charitable trusts and the 
public.

Dame Lynne said: 
'To look at this small and intensely beautiful treasure from the 
Anglo-Saxon period is to see it exactly as those who created it in the 
seventh century would have seen it.

'The exquisite binding, the pages, even the sewing structure survive intact, offering us a direct connection with our forebears 1,300 years ago.

'Its importance in the history of the book and its association with one of Britain’s foremost saints make it unique, so I am delighted to announce the successful acquisition of the St Cuthbert Gospel by the British Library.

'This precious item will remain in public hands so that present and future generations can learn from it.'

The book will also go on show in Durham next year.

The Very Rev Michael Sadgrove, Dean of Durham, said: 'It is the best possible news to know that the Cuthbert Gospel has been saved for the nation. For the people of Durham and north-east England, this is a most treasured book. Buried with Cuthbert and retrieved from his coffin, it held a place of great honour in Durham Cathedral Priory.'
