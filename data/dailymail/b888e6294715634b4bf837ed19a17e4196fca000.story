The BBC has been accused of cruelty for using wild animals in a new  drama.

Our Zoo tells the true story of Chester Zoo, which pioneered a freer approach to animal captivity.

But just days before it screens nationwide, a coalition of animal rights groups have launched a bitter campaign against the show's 'cruel' use of wild animals as actors, calling it 'a shocking use of public money'.

'Outdated': Campaigners have blasted the Corporation for 'using public money to fund an outdated practice'

It comes a week before Parliament debates banning circuses in England - a motion supported by 95 per cent of people surveyed in the Government consultation.

Liz Tyson, of the Captive Animals' Protection Society (CAPS), told MailOnline: 'The use of wild animals in entertainment is both cruel and unnecessary. 

'It is shocking that the BBC has used the public's licence fees to fund this outdated practice.'

The BBC series, which screens on September 3, follows the journey of George Mottershead who, in 1930, transformed a derelict plot of land into a sanctuary for exotic animals - which is now one of the world's most popular zoos.

He had been inspired to create a zoo 'without bars' after witnessing caged animals at a zoo in Manchester. The estate today covers a total of 500 acres, of which the zoo takes up 110.

Recreating George's journey, Our Zoo features penguins, monkeys, a camel, and bears.

However, it has emerged the animal actors were scouted from scandal-hit firm Amazing Animals, which was exposed for sending lion cubs born in the West Midlands to a Japanese performing circus.

It comes after Amazing Animals was blasted for providing lion cubs to a Japanese performing circus

The firm became embroiled in a fresh scandal last week for providing wild bear cubs as entertainment for a quaint country fair in Oxfordshire.

Now, CAPS has launched a petition with Wild Futures and Born Free Foundation calling on the BBC Trust for an urgent review of its use of performing animals in productions with a view to ending the hiring of such companies going forward.

Ms Tyson, who has built a petition with two other animal rights' groups rallying against Amazing Animals, told MailOnline: 'Domesticated animals like cats and dogs have gone through genetic changes via the process of domestication over thousands of years. Wild animals have not.

'These animal entertainment companies often argue that the animals are fourth or fifth generation captive bred and therefore domesticated or no longer wild.

'This is simply not the case.

'A few generations of captive breeding does nothing to change the genetic make-up of these animals.'

Rachel Hevesi, director of Wild Futures, added: 'Every monkey that arrives at the Sanctuary has serious psychological, and often physical, problems.

'This is not caused by deliberate cruelty, but by a lack of understanding of the needs of a wild animal.' 

Adam Roberts, acting CEO of the Born Free Foundation, said: 'The BBC has a global reputation for quality programming. If it wishes to retain that reputation it must move with the times and adapt to changing attitudes. 

'The use of captive wild animals for entertainment is now widely regarded as unethical among the British public, and we are convinced that a lifetime of training, transport, and performance puts the welfare of the animals at significant risk.' 

The charities have established an online petition and are encouraging members of the public to join the call for action. 

A spokesperson from the show said: 'Our Zoo consulted with the RSCPA Performing Animals Advisory Service and followed their guidelines at all times. An independent vet was on set whenever animals were filmed and they filed a report at the end of the working day. There were no incidents during filming.'
