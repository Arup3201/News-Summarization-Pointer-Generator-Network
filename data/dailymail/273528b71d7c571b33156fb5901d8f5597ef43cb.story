The quartet of City high-fliers  no doubt wanted to keep their wayward rugby tour antics under wraps.

But unfortunately, they made the mistake of emailing a list of their lurid ‘tour rules’ to their friends.

Within days, the email went ‘viral’ and it has now been seen around the world.

The four drew up their checklist ahead of their trip to the Dubai Sevens rugby tournament next month.

It included plans to have and 
photograph group sex acts, to chant about their wealth and drink heavily
while being offensive to local residents.

After spanning the globe, the email 
has heaped embarrassment on the group and their employers, which they 
proudly named in pen portraits of themselves.

Last night the top law firm employing 
the ‘vice captain’ of the group, solicitor Daniel England, 27, had begun
an inquiry into the offensive email.

The rest of the group are ‘president’ 
James Hill, 27, an international insurance broker, ‘senior 
vice-president’ George Boulton-Lea, 24, a ship broker, and ‘captain’ 
Rory Jones, 27, a marketing executive in Singapore.

The saga began when the four, calling 
themselves G4, shared their ‘tour rules’ by email. It began with an 
endorsement of infidelity – ‘Cheating is allowed’ – and went on to say 
‘No anti-lad behaviour allowed ie calling girlfriends, being nice to 
random expats’, before becoming even more offensive.

The rules include, at point (v) 
‘Compulsory gunning of parents’ affairs’ – meaning that whenever one of 
the group mentions an affair involving another’s parents, he will have 
to swallow an agreed portion of alcohol as a forfeit.

Another says ‘Chants about your surrounding environment, being oily and how rich we are, are compulsory’.

They vowed they would be ‘Mentioning 
parents salaries once a day’ before saying that cameras would only be 
allowed underwater, or to film group sex acts ‘for evidential purposes’.

The ‘rules’ go on to declare that 
during group sex acts, they must degrade the woman involved, and 
‘high-five’ each other throughout.

Mr Hill, an old boy of Tonbridge 
School in Kent, Mr Boulton-Lea, who attended Epsom College, and Mr Jones
and Mr England, who both went to the City of London Freemen’s School, 
were yesterday unavailable for comment.

James Hill President (pictured left)

James is a Terrorism and Political Violence Insurance Broker at Willis.

His responsibilities focus on reviewing submissions, structuring, 
servicing and placing Terrorism insurance and reinsurance in the London,
Singapore and overseas marketplaces.

James attained First Class Honours at the University of Bristol where he
was also an active member of the University of Bristol Rugby Club and 
University of Bristol Squash Club.

James attended Tonbridge School where he played Rugby, Hockey, Cricket and Rackets to a very high standard.

He is a remarkably good looking individual who is permanently tanned and has an extremely muscular body.

Due to his age and competency he will be President of the G4 and will be
respected by his peers at all times – no one doubts his ability to stay
strong throughout the tour.

George Boulton-LeaSenior Vice President (second left)

George is a Ship Broker at Arrow, where he has worked three years.

His charm with people have [sic] ensured his rapid progression in the Shipping
Industry and he is tipped to be the next big thing in the world of 
Shipping.

George attended the University of Leeds where he was a strong 
figure-head amongst the social scene ? combining work and play in order 
to succeed .

Before this he attended Epsom College where he was captain of the 1st XV Football team and played 1st XV Rugby.

He is a key component of the G4 and his consistency in performances have [sic] secured his place as Senior Vice President.

He is known for his energetic and party side and he will certainly be one to follow when the sun goes down.

Rory JonesCaptain (second right)

Rory is currently and [sic] Account Executive at Lightfoot Marketing Asia.

However his true career path lies in Law - Rory was an Intern at Justice
where he formed part of a small team scrutinising the implications of 
EU justice and home affairs proposals.

He has also interned at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and will be training to be a Lawyer in London next year.

Rory attended the University of Nottingham where he achieved a Distinction in his Masters. Before this he attended City of London Freemen’s School where he captained the 1st XV Rugby team.

Rory’s ability to be a team player and push himself and others beyond 
their normal boundaries means his role as Captain will be central to a 
successful Dubai tour.

He is a strong character and his resilience in battle time and time 
again mean that he can now be compared to a true Viking warrior.

Daniel EnglandVice Captain (right)

Daniel is successful lawyer at Shearman & Sterling LLP.

He attended University College London where he obtained First Class Honours.

At University he was also a member 2nd XV Rugby Team and the Law Society.

Before this he attended City of London Freemen’s School where he was 
Vice Captain of the 1st XV Rugby team and was the youngest player in the
School to tour South Africa.

Daniel’s loyalty, honesty and positive attitude bring another dimension 
to the G4, he rarely puts himself first and can be trusted by all other 
team members.

His whit [sic], intelligence and looks will ensure the G4 socialise with the right people in Dubai – he his [sic] definitely one to watch.

Mr England’s employers, Shearman and 
Sterling lawyers, refused to comment – but a senior source at the firm 
told the Daily Mail: ‘We have taken the matter very seriously and are 
investigating it in accordance with our procedures.’

The law firm’s head of personnel is 
understood to be supervising the inquiry into Mr England’s behaviour – 
which could lead to disciplinary action.

The celebration of group sex in the email is understood to be considered to conflict with the company’s ‘diversity training’.

Mr Hill works as a terrorism and 
political violence insurance broker for multinational firm Willis – 
which proclaims on its website that ‘unethical behaviour will not be 
tolerated’, and that ‘offensive behaviour of a sexual nature is 
absolutely prohibited’. A Willis spokesman did not respond to requests 
for comment.

The employers of Mr Jones and Mr Boulton-Lea, Lightfoot Marketing Asia and Arrow ship brokers, both declined to comment.

Their families are similarly unlikely to be happy at their names being dragged into the furore.
