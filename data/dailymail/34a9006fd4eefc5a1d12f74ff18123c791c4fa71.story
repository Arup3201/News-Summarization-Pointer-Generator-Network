Actress Patricia Hodge has revealed how she was forced to take the heartbreaking decision to put her dementia-suffering husband into a care home.

Peter Owen, who was a successful music publisher, now barely recognises the award-winning star. He was diagnosed with the illness two years ago but his condition quickly deteriorated.

Ms Hodge, who played Miranda Hart’s mother Penny in the popular BBC sitcom Miranda, said: ‘Dementia is a devastating illness. Fifteen months ago Peter went into a home.

‘Sometimes he does know who I am and can recognise me and the family. But he does not know at times that I am his wife. It varies.’

The couple married in 1976 and have two sons – Alexander, 26, and Edward, 23.

Ms Hodge added: ‘It’s all so sad. This illness is horrific.’

The 68-year-old actress was speaking at a ceremony to mark a £28 million revamp of her old drama school, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).

In an interview last year, she spoke fondly about life with her husband before his dementia took hold.

She said: ‘He was such a strong dependable figure in the boys’ lives, so we live with great sadness in our hearts, but you just have to get on with life. These have been a difficult few years for our family.

‘Alexander has struggled with it but he has also been magnificent. He has kind of got to be head of the family now, but I don’t lean on him. It’s up to him to choose his role. 

'Not long ago, in all his pain, he said, “Mum, let’s not forget the wonderful things we have.” Hearing that was just 24 carat.’

Ms Hodge made her West End debut in 1972 and won a coveted Olivier Award in 2000 for her role in Money. She is also famous for playing QC Phyllida Erskine-Brown in Rumpole Of The Bailey.
