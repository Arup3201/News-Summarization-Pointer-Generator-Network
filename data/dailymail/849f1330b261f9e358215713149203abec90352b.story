Alexis Sanchez has been training at Arsenal's London Colney training base with Chile ahead of their game against Brazil in London, but has been joined by some unlikely new team-mates: his dogs.

Sanchez's Chile meet Brazil in a repeat of last summer's World Cup second-round clash at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, and the Arsenal forward has been making the most of his home comforts between training sessions with his international colleagues.

In what seems a slightly unusual way of preparing for a game, the 26-year-old has been taking his dogs around the pitches during the international break.

Sunday's South American showdown at the Emirates pits Sanchez against his former Barcelona team-mate Neymar, who he still holds a close friendship with.

The pair last met at the World Cup, with Neymar's Brazil prevailing on penalties. Sanchez had scored Chile's first-half equaliser in Belo Horizonte but missed in the shoot-out before Neymar sealed the win for the hosts.

'I'm so excited and honoured to be playing for the national team of Chile, against our great rivals Brazil, in front of the incredible Arsenal fans at Emirates Stadium,' Sanchez said.

'I also look forward to playing against my good friend Neymar.

'Matches between Brazil and Chile are always exciting encounters, and for me, to play this game at Emirates Stadium will make the match even more special.' 

Training at London Colney with Chile is a familiar experience for Sanchez, as it is usually Arsenal's base 

The 26-year-old forward has had an impressive season since arriving in the Barclays Premier League
