These are the ambitious plans which suggest skyscrapers of the future may one day house an entire city.

This 'Endless City' project would see a giant skyscraper as tall as The Shard in London, built with its own complete  ecosystem featuring offices, shops and 'huge' parks.

London is the proposed city for the mixed-use tower, which would include interlinking ramps connecting different sections of the structure to create a 'vertical city' housing thousands.

Architects believe the 'Endless City' skyscraper, pictured in its design phase, would help create much-needed space in crowded city areas and feature its own 'ecosystem'

Residents would be able to walk around intertwining ramps in the interior of the giant building, passing through shopping, commercial and residential areas in a so-called 'vertical city'

Vast: The building would include many of the features that can be found in a city environment, including parking, green spaces and parks, shopping districts, housing and entertainment

The proposal has been drawn up by SURE Architecture, whose design has already won the SkyScrapers and SuperSkyScrapers Competition.

The firm insists the building would be a great space-saver in dense cities which have previously spread outwards rather than upwards.

Although the skyscraper is only at design phase, the company has earmarked a location close to the City of London - but it remains to be seen whether it will reach the construction stage.

It is not yet clear exactly how tall the building would be, but early indications suggest it could top 300m - around the same as London's tallest skyscraper The Shard. The building would take up an area of 165,855 sq m. 

Residents would be able to walk up a series of interlinked ramps through vibrant streets, plazas, technological spaces and 'huge' parks in a 'complex and rich system like a real city'

According to the company's report, the building's shape will 'maximize passive energy and reduce artificial light, cooling and heating needs'.

The different levels, as well as having stunning views of the surrounding area, will feature plazas and communal spaces.

Alina Valcarce, associate director of SURE Architecture, said: 'There is no break anymore, neither between street level and the skyscraper, nor between the skyscraper floors themselves.

'The goal of the design is to conceive an open building that is effective as it is inviting and a powerful symbol in all directions while being permeated by generosity and openness.'

Structural support for the giant tower would be provided by six steel tubes, which would also contain the plumbing and electrical work for much of the building.
