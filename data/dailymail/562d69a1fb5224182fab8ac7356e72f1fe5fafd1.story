A raunchy burger ad which features both Paris Hilton and swimsuit model Hannah Ferguson has been banned in New Zealand.

The advertisement for Carl's Jr. American burger chain used sex appeal to promote its new Texas BBQ Thickburger which comes with cripsy fried jalapeno.

Hilton tweeted that the ad was 'so hot, it's been banned from TV in New Zealand'.

The ad begins with Ferguson in a black bikini as she seduces the camera by washing a truck whilst also taking a bite out of the mammoth new burger. 

Then Hilton makes her entrance by driving up in a black shiny luxury car, also wearing swimwear which shows off her features.

The socialite struts up to her model companion, only to tell her that she's missed a spot whilst cleaning the truck.

Hilton is referring to the deep-fried jalapeno which previously dropped from the burger, as she picks it up and pops it in her mouth.

This isn't the first time the fast-food outlet has had its ad rejected by New Zealand's Commercial Approvals Bureau, the body which assesses TV ads before they go to air.

Last year a similarly racy ad was barred, the New Zealand Herald reports.

CAB general manager Rob Hoar said the new ad did exactly the last.

'They sent it to us and said, what do you think? And we said no...because it would have been in breach of the Advertising Standards Authority's codes,' he told the Herald.

'I don't think they ever thought we would approve it, I just think they wanted to be able to put out a press release.'

The burger comes with a charbroiled Angus beef patty, American cheese, topped with beef brisket, mesquite barbecue sauce, crispy jalapeno and onion strips. 

Carl's Jr is an American fast-food restaurants which has outlets worldwide. 

Paris Hilton tweeted about the ban of the advertisement on New Zealand TV on Friday
