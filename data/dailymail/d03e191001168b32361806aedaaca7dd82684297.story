A voyeur has been charged after allegedly photographing the crotches and buttocks of hundreds of women who sat above him on the steps of Washington, D.C., memorials for nearly a year.

Christopher Hunt Cleveland was 
arrested on June 19 after a police officer caught him sneakily snapping 'upskirt' shots near the Lincoln Memorial steps and Reflecting Pool,  according to a search warrant affidavit.

The Washington Post reported the Springfield resident, who 'didn't think crotch shots were illegal', was charged in the D.C. Superior Court with voyeurism and assault on a police officer.

Cleveland reportedly became aggressive after officers, convinced he was taking inappropriate photos using a camera with a telephoto lens, confronted him.

He initially walked away from police and tried to remove a memory card from the camera, according to the affidavit.

When officers told him to drop the camera, he allegedly disobeyed and resisted arrest.

Officers found numerous shots of women’s crotches and buttocks in Cleveland's camera, and spoke to one of the photographed women who said she didn't agree to the photo.

Investigators later searched 
Cleveland’s car and found a laptop containing at least 150 PowerPoint 
slide presentations, each containing 30 or more upskirt images or images
 leading up to the shots.

InTheCapital reported Cleveland may have taken at least 4,500 inappropriate photos.

Cleveland admitted to investigators he'd visited the Lincoln Memorial 
several times in the previous months to photograph women, not thinking it was illegal.

However the photos, taken at various locations in the D.C. area, dated back nearly a year, The Washington Post reported.

Court papers state authorities seized a computer, cameras and other items from the Peeping Tom's Fairfax County home.

Park Police said the Lincoln Memorial steps are 'commonly used by individuals engaged in voyeuristic activity'.
