A policeman surprised crowds watching the Tour de France by taking a busker’s guitar and bursting into song.

The appropriately named PC Will Medley, from the Leeds City Neighbourhood Policing Team, gave the impromptu performance while patrolling Leeds city centre in West Yorkshire, as part of the policing operation for the Grand Depart on Saturday.

His accomplished rendition of Stealers Wheel’s Stuck In The Middle With You - famously used during a torture scene in Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs - drew in dozens of onlookers, who can be seen giving him a round of applause.

'There was a great atmosphere in the city centre for the Tour de France,' said PC Medley, who has played the guitar for nearly 15 years.

'When I was on patrol in Briggate, a busker asked me if it was OK to play.

'I had a chat with him and told him that I played the guitar. 

'He asked me to play a song so I obliged.  

The video has attracted hundreds of positive comments labelling the performance as 'an amazing advert for West Yorkshire Police'

'There weren’t that many people there at first but when I started playing, a crowd started gathering and showing support. Someone shouted, "Get on the microphone" so I did.' 

PC Medley’s performance was filmed by colleague PC Matt Thirkill in Briggate and posted on the neighbourhood policing team’s Facebook page, where it has already reached 174,720 people and notched up 1,416 likes and 833 shares.

The video has attracted hundreds of positive comments labelling the performance as 'an amazing advert for West Yorkshire Police' and an example of 'true public interaction'.

The reaction to PC Medley’s stunning performance has even caused charges of 'stealing the limelight' to be dropped - which was one of the jokes from his colleagues.

Sergeant Andy Berriman said: 'We did joke that Will is now wanted as the prime suspect for an offence of theft of limelight but the public’s response both at the time and to the Facebook posting has been fantastic.

'It is without doubt the biggest response we’ve had to anything we’ve posted on our Facebook page and the comments it has received are overwhelmingly positive.

He added: 'We set out during the Tour de France to show the human face of policing and that clearly came across with officers getting into the spirit of the event in Leeds and further afield.

'Will’s impromptu performance was clearly a welcome addition to that positive approach to community relations and it has definitely helped to boost our image and won us some fans.'
