A four-year-old boy has shot himself dead after finding a gun at his babysitter's home.

Codrick Beal had been staying overnight at a friend of his mother's in north Harris County, Texas when he fatally shot himself just before noon on Sunday.

He had been visiting the home while his mother, Ashley Beal, celebrated her birthday. His father, Codrick McCall, was also not at the scene of the shooting.

It is still unclear how the boy came across the firearm and authorities continue to investigate.

After the boy was found, relatives and friends were seen comforting each other outside the house in the 19000 block of Imperial Stone.

'My baby is gone!' the boy's mother Ashley cried outside the home as authorities swept the property.

Codrick, her only child, was reportedly staying with a long-time friend of his mother's.

The babysitter had to be collected by EMS, having sobbed so hard that she collapsed on the road outside the house in convulsions. 

'It's just a terrible accident,' Ashley's cousin, Leticia Beal told the Houston Chronicle.  'We see it all the time on the news but you never think it'll hit home. It's the most horrible thing.'

The boy's paternal grandmother also wept as she paid tribute to youngster on Sunday.

'Four years old. He had so much to live for,' Sharron McCall told KTRK.

'You can't bring death back. What has happened has happened. All we can do is try to pick up the pieces and continue with life there is nothing else to do.'

She did not shed anymore light on the death but said she thinks her grandson should still be here.

'They sell you safety locks with your firearm when you purchase it,' she said. 

Authorities from the Harris County Sheriff's Office investigated the scene but have not disclosed the kind of gun was fired or who the owned it.

Deputies said no charges have yet been brought and a Harris County grand jury would decide if any one should be charged in the death.

Sadness: Codrick's paternal grandmother, Sharron McCall, said she had no idea how the accident happened because guns should have safety locks. Through tears, she said her grandson had so much to live for

Loved: Four-year-old Codrick, pictured with his grandmother, was his mother's only child

'He was a loveable baby,' said Keith Beal, Ashley's uncle. 'Very funny, he loved to play around all the time. He just had so much life in him, he was always a happy baby.' 

A spokeswoman for Harris County Child Protective Services said they are also investigating.

KTRK reported that CPS has previously responded to calls regarding the boy's parents but had never been sent to the home where the boy died.   

The tragic death is the second time a child has died in Houston of an accidental shooting in less than a week with a three-year-old reportedly killed Friday in Harris County.

That boy's mother was in the house when she heard the gunshot and rushed to find him with a bullet wound to the neck and jaw. The boy  died at Memorial Hermann Hospital.
