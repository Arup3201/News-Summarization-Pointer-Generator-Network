A man who was caught stealing women's underwear after by breaking into homes and raiding tumble driers has been jailed. 

Christopher McHarg was filmed sneaking into a garage on several occasions to steal pink and white ladies bras and bottoms.

The 28-year-old from Monkton, Ayrshire, was jailed after the family installed a secret camera when they noticed their undergarments going missing. 

Christopher McHarg was filmed stealing women's underwear and clothes from a tumble drier after breaking in to his victim's garage a number of times over several weeks last year

After being reported to police officers found around 100 items of clothing at McHarg's home that he had stolen from the drier. 

Footage taken on the camera show him breaking in to the garage in the middle of the night, using the light on his phone as a torch to select items of underwear. 

He was handed a community payback order at Ayr Sheriff Court and told to complete 200 hours of unpaid community service after admitting to stealing the underwear between July and November last year. 

He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for two years.  

Speaking after the sentencing a source close to the family said: 'They were getting increasingly puzzled as to where all this underwear was disappearing to and set up their own camera.

'It recorded hours and hours of footage and they would occasionally check it. 

'But to their astonishment they saw a person creeping around their property and recognised it was McHarg. 

'He can be seen carefully choosing what items he wants to keep and then puts the rest back. It’s disturbing and really creepy to see.

'The family are glad it’s all over but feel he should have been given a tougher sentence.' 

Sheriff Scott Pattison rejected the claim McHarg had no sexual motivation, telling the court: 'He says there was no fixation but it went on for six months.

McHarg told the court he did not know why he had broken in to steal the underwear. He was caught when his victims installed a hidden camera after so much of their wardrobes went missing

His victims said they were disappointed with McHarg's sentence and were shocked to learn it had been him stealing their clothes

The 28-year-old was put on the sex offenders' register and told to complete 200 hours of unpaid work

'The offence and persistency of it is very concerning indeed.

'I’m certifying the offence as having a sexual aspect.' 

However defending counsel Gregor Forbes said the 28-year-old had been drinking every time he decided to raid the tumble drier. 

'It wasn’t particularly well thought out - using a mobile phone as a torch.

'He made seven visits to the house, removing clothes on five of them.

'His GP has referred him to a psychologist and it’s been a stressful time for him.

'He’s been signed off his work at a local supermarket.'

Sheriff Scott Pattison said: 'He says there was no fixation but it went on for six months.

'The offence and persistency of it is very concerning indeed.

'I'm certifying the offence as having a sexual aspect.'
