BBC director-general George Entwistle yesterday admitted knowing about the Newsnight Savile investigation when he ploughed ahead with eulogies showering tributes on the presenter.

It came as he ordered a belated inquiry into the abuse scandal and offered an apology to Savile’s victims.

He expressed ‘deep regret’ over ‘these awful allegations’ as he announced his U-turn on Radio 4, having previously insisted that no BBC inquiry was necessary.

Mr Entwistle revealed he had been informed early last December about Newsnight’s investigation - which probed Savile’s alleged reign of child abuse at the BBC - in advance of screening shows celebrating the Jim’ll Fix It presenter’s life.

However Mr Entwistle, being interviewed on the Today programme, claimed he had never asked what Newsnight’s investigation was actually discovering about Savile.

His comments came as Lord Patten, the BBC Trust chairman, made his first public comments on the growing scandal, telling a business dinner in Cardiff it was ‘no excuse to say, “That was then” in the 1960s, 70s and 80s and attitudes were different then.’

He added: ‘It’s no excuse to say, “I’m sure the same thing used to happen with pop groups and others at the time”. Those things may be true but they don’t provide an excuse.’

He said that the BBC will carry out its own investigation ‘in a way which will have to command credibility in the wider community’ - but only once the police inquiry is completed.

He added: ‘The BBC exists above all on trust and the relationship between the wider public and the BBC itself.’

Investigations: Detectives are to probe whether Sir Jimmy Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice

Newsnight’s film was shelved, and instead
viewers and listeners were treated to a series of programmes lavishing 
praise on Savile after his death aged 84 in October last year.

At least seven police forces are now 
examining claims he raped and molested schoolgirls during four decades 
as a radio and TV presenter.

Detectives will also probe whether Savile ran a wider sex ring at the BBC after two women named a former corporation employee as being his accomplice. Both women have reported their claims to police.

A week ago, the corporation insisted it had ‘no evidence’ of any abuse, but yesterday Mr Entwistle told Radio 4 he wanted to apologise to women victims ‘on behalf of the organisation …for what they’ve had to endure here’.

Presenter Evan Davies asked him why the BBC ran a eulogy on Savile after evidence of abuse surfaced during the Newsnight inquiry.

Mr Entwistle, who was the BBC’s Head of Vision at the time, said: ‘I didn’t know what had become of that investigation, I didn’t know what discoveries, if any, that they had.’
