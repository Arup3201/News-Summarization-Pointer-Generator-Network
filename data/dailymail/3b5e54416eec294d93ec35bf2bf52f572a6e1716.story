A job applicant has scored a burgeoning fan base after coming up with a zany way to demonstrate his skills and experience.

Doing away with a paper CV, 24-year-old Elski Felson of Los Angeles, California, decided to apply for a Community Support Specialist role at Snapchat via the social media app.

In just over three minutes, the tech enthusiast created a video resume, underscoring how he's a 'multi-tasking rockstar', 'graph enthusiast' and an 'experienced researcher' with 'phenomenal presentation skills'.

Throughout the clip - uploaded to YouTube on February 26 - he takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to showcase his abilities.

To show he's a 'strong writer' he sits with a barbell on his hand scrawling a note. 

Unfortunately, the heavy load causes the pencil to snap.

In another scene Felson expertly guesses the weight of an onion to display his strong judgement.

The grocery store assistant is seen praising his aptitude. 

When it comes to presentation skills, Felson steps away from Powerpoint and into the kitchen.

'I don’t know what you’ve seen or where you’ve been, but I know me, personally, I’ve never seen Laffy Taffy look that phenomenal in all my life,' he says as he captures a plate of candy arranged into a color wheel.

Lastly, the Snapchat job specification asks for someone who is an 'expert in sending ugly selfies to friends.'

Felson happily fulfills the prerequisite by striking a pose at the camera with his nose pushed up in an unattractive manner.

He finishes by claiming that 'he's the man for the job' and just one class away from finishing his MBA.

The job hunter told Daily Mail Online that he's yet to hear back from Snapchat but he's keeping his fingers crossed. Dozens of tech start-ups have been in touch in the meantime.

Felson graduated from Ithaca College in New York in 2013 and searched for finance jobs in Pittsburgh before moving to California.

He said that he got the idea of applying to Snapchat after walking past their office in Venice. 

His dream role would be one that has a creative aspect.

But after his stint in front of the camera, Felson is also considering delving into the world of entertainment.

'I love interacting with people so, if I were offered some type of job on camera, I would definitely entertain it,' the hopeful graduate concluded.

Source of inspiration: Felson made his comical Snapchat video by tackling each one of the job requirements one by one - he is yet to hear back from the company
