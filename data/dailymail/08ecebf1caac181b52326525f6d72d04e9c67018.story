Tragic: AIK goalkeeper Ivan Turina pictured during a training session in Stockholm, died in his sleep last night

Fans of Swedish football champions AIK have been paying tribute to the team's goalkeeper who died in his sleep at his Stockholm apartment.

Croatian Ivan Turina, 32, was known by his club, who he played for 89 times since signing from Dinamo Zagreb, to have a congenital heart problem.

AIK confirmed his death in a statement adding that there are thought to be no suspicious circumstances.

Hundreds of the club's supporters 
visited the team's Karlberg training ground after news of Turina's death
broke, with many laying flowers and scarves at a makeshift shrine 
dedicated to the fans' favourite.

The goalkeeper was father to one-year-old twins and his wife is currently pregnant with the couple's third child.

A
statement released by AIK said: 'It is with great sorrow and shock that
we can confirm that goalkeeper Ivan Turina passed away on the night 
between Wednesday and Thursday.

'Ivan died suddenly in his sleep and at the moment no crime is suspected.

'AIK Football thoughts go out to Ivan's partner and two daughters and his other relatives and friends.

'The club has informed the team and other employees about what happened.

'We ask all to respect all parties and allow them to mourn in peace.'

AIK chairman Johan Segui told Swedish 
newspaper Expressen: 'We knew that he had a congenital heart problem but
he was completely healthy.'

Striker Henok Goitom, who lived next door to Turina, said he was told of the news by the goalkeeper's mother-in-law.

He said: 'His wife's mother rang hysterically on my doorbell.

'Yesterday was an ordinary day. Today, Ivan is dead, it's a shock. The AIK supporters loved him.

'It's a slap in the face for everyone but we are united as a group and we're trying to help everyone in AIK and his family.

The popular player had recently extended his contract with the club to 2016.

Mourning: Both AIK and Croatian flags were flying at half mast at AIK's training ground today

Flags at the training ground flew at 
half mast as red-eyed players and staff spoke quietly with the assembled
media and supporters.

Turina kept 35 clean sheets in his time at AIK and won a single cap for Croatia when he played against Hong Kong in 2006.

He also turned out for top flight clubs in Poland and Greece as well as for Dinamo Zagreb in his native Croatia.

He played against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in a Champions League Qualifier in 2006.

It is unclear whether AIK's next league game against IFK Gothenburg on Monday will go ahead as planned.
