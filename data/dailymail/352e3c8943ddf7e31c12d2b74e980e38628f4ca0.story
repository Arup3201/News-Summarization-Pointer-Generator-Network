Two sisters stole funeral wreaths from a grave hours after a pensioner's funeral to sell them on to other grieving families, a court has heard.

Marion Hill and Lyndsay Millett face jail after they were caught on CCTV taking the wreaths from a grave at Springwood Crematorium in Liverpool and putting them in the back of a hire car.

They insisted that they intended to put the wreaths on their own mother's grave at the nearby Allerton Cemetery.

But when police searched the Speke home of Hill, 41, they found it was packed full of black condolence cards, wreath stands and what Liverpool Magistrates' Court was told was 'wreath-making paraphenalia'.

Officers also discovered seven wreaths, including one bearing the word 'Dad', and a Winnie the Pooh photo album packed with various pictures of floral tribute arrangements was found.

Prosecutors believe that the sisters were stealing the wreaths to run a macabre 'commercial venture'.

The wreaths that they had been caught  taking from the Springwood Crematorium on May 7, one forming the word 'Mum' and the other 'Nan', were also found.

They had been stolen just hours after the funeral earlier that day of Bridget Jannet.

Mrs Jannet's son Chris, who attended yesterday's hearing, said he had been devastated when he discovered the two wreaths, covered in blue and white flowers, as well as a bunch of roses, had gone.

Mr Jannet, from Anfield, added: 'This incident has left me shocked to the core to think somebody could commit such a callous act.'

The court was told that when Hill was initially arrested, she told police 'I'm admitting it'.

Later she and sister Millett, 37, also of Speke, maintained the flowers were intended to go on their late mother's grave.

CCTV showed the pair arriving at the crematorium in a black Land Rover which had been hired by Hill, who was seen to run out, pick up the wreaths and stash them in the back.

She told the court she had hired the car for two days as a 'pick-me-up' after working long hours.

Andrew Hodgson, prosecuting, said: 'What about if you hired it for picking things up, going round crematoria and cemeteries and picking things up and putting them in the back?'

The court was told the two stolen wreaths had cost £90 each.

Mr Hodgson said: 'These ladies were making money out of what they were doing, by selling on these arrangements.

'A reasonable sum of money can be made in this business, particularly if you are stealing the items that you are selling on.'

Defence lawyer Leanne Kennedy said the sisters claimed many of the items used for making wreaths had been left to them by their aunt, who the court was told had been keen on art.

Magistrate Dennis Brant said the prosecution case was 'overwhelming'.

He said all sentencing options, including jail, were open. They were granted unconditional bail, and the case was adjourned until October 30.
