Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois has admitted the Blues asked him to return a year earlier and has praised the managerial style of Jose Mourinho.

The 22-year-old joined Chelsea in 2011 and has finally displaced Petr Cech as Chelsea's number one keeper since returning from three years on loan in Spain at Atletico Madrid.

Despite Chelsea's request, Courtois stayed with Atletico last season and won the La Liga title but felt it was the right time to return to West London in the summer to try and conquer the Premier League.

'The first two years at Atletico had gone well and, in 2013, Chelsea had wanted me back but I wasn’t 100 per cent sure,' Courtois told The Guardian.

'I knew a third year in Spain would maybe be a chance to do something special. We did that by winning La Liga and reaching the Champions League final.

'After that, it felt the right moment to go to Chelsea.'

The 22-year-old has praised Blues boss Jose Mourinho for his motivational skills and man-management

The Belgium international has become an integral part of Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's unbeaten side so far this season and Courtois believes his motivating personality and astute managerial skills are the source of the success.

'Working for him [Jose Mourinho] now, it is easy to see why his sides have that fighting mentality. He motivates you.

'With Mourinho, everything is good. He knows when to be among his players, as "one of us" making jokes as a friend, and when to be strong and distant, even severe. That’s how it has to be to get the team sharp.

'[Diego] Simeone did that, also, in his own way. He was an ex-player so he knew how we ticked.'
