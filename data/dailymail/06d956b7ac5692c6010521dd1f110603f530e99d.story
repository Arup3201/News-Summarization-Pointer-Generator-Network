An American student was forced to walk across the U.S-Mexico border after being placed on the government’s no-fly list. 

Despite having lived in San Diego all his life, Kevin Iraniha was told he was barred from flying into the U.S. on Tuesday when he attempted to check in at a Costa Rica airport, following his master's degree graduation ceremony.

Along with his two brothers and father, the 27-year-old, who is a Muslim, was detained and questioned by FBI agents at the U.S. Embassy in San Jose.

Kevin Iraniha was barred from flying into the U.S. on Tuesday when he attempted to check in at a Costa Rica airport and told he wasn¿t allowed to fly into the country

Officers probed him about his religious beliefs, practices and affiliations, as well as recent travels to Iran, where his father was born and where he still has family.

The brothers and father were later allowed to board the flight but had to abandon Kevin, who was told he could only return to the United States by ship or foot.

On Thursday Iraniha was reunited with his family, having trekked across the border

Kevin Iraniha was trying to fly home after graduating from his master's degree in Costa Rica with his his brothers Jahan, left, Shervin, second from left, and his father, Nasser, right

Mr Iraniha’s incensed father, Nasser, said he feels 
his family have been discriminated against. ‘None of this makes sense,’ 
he told Fox News. ‘Whoever did this is not American.’

He was given no indication as to why his son had been put on the no-fly list.

Under the U.S. Privacy Act, the FBI will not confirm nor deny an individual’s inclusion on the list, which has more than 20,000 names on it. Around 500 of them are U.S. citizens.

Mr Iraniha flew to Mexico City and from there walked across the border to California, begging for places to stay overnight and with nothing other than the clothes he was wearing.

Looking bleary eyed and exhausted, Mr Iraniha was finally reunited with his family in San Ysidro on Thursday.

In an interview with NBC San Diego the graduate described his ordeal as ‘very tiring and very depressing’.

He added: ‘I'm happy to be home, finally in my hometown where I was born and raised.’
