A man who jumped out of a helicopter while two friends waited for him on the ground has been reported missing after failing to land in the drop-zone.

The 29-year-old Florida man, whose identity has not yet been released, was skydiving in the Cascade foothills east of Seattle with two others.

The helicoper pilot reported him jumping from the aircraft at around 2.30pm on Thursday from a height of approximately 6,500ft.

Stunning: The missing mad had jumped out a helicopter near Mount Si in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State

The pilot said three men were alternating going up in the helicopter to jump, with one jumping while the others waited at the landing zone near Mount Si, about 30 miles east of Seattle.

He said their line of sight was blocked so they could not see the man jump.Â  The men were on their second round of jumps when the man disappeared.

Around 75 members of King County sheriff's search and rescue unit spent hours searching for the man after he went missing, but the search was called off last night.

King County sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Cindi West said the man had jumped near a 2,500ft peak on the west side of the mountain.

She said the search would resume in daylight on Friday.

A local television report said the pilot did not know whether the skydiver's parachute had opened.

In a separate incident yesterday, Florida
baseball player Stephen Spradling underwent surgery yesterday after he 
was badly injured in a skydiving accident on Sunday.

WCTV.tv reported that the Florida State Senior Outfielder was 100ft from the ground when he noticed another skydiver coming into his path.

He pulled his chute and hit the ground, breaking his pelvis, ribs, hips and a bone in his back.

Spradling's doctors said he would be in a wheelchair for a couple of months but believe he will walk again.

And last month a 51-year-old Las Vegas man died when skydiving at Jean Airport in Nevada after his parachute folded in strong winds.

Richard Frazer got caught in a gust of wind after jumping out of a plane at 10,000ft.

In an article in the Las Vegas Review Journal, the Clark County coroner said the accident was due to poor weather rather than equipment failure.
