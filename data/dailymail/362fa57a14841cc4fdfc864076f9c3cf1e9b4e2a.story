Inheritance: Sian Davies apparently spent £60,000 on funding the Maoist commune where she lived

The woman who mysteriously died while living in a Maoist commune handed over all of her £60,000 inheritance to the extremist sect, it emerged today.

Sian Davies received thousands of pounds when her father Alun died in 1970 - but apparently spent most of it on funding the far-Left movement based in South London.

When she died, she had just £5 in her bank account and her only possession was a stash of Marxist literature, according to reports.

It has also been claimed that Ms Davies' family, from whom she was enstranged, were so worried about her being exploited that they froze her bank account.

She died in 1997 after breaking her neck when she fell from a window at the building in Brixton where she was living with cult leader Aravindan Balakrishnan and his other followers.

Three other women, including Ms Davies' daughter Rosie, who has lived with the sect her whole life, escaped the property last week.

They were yesterday interviewed by police for the first time as officers investigate whether Balakrishnan, known as 'Comrade Bala', and his wife Chanda should face charges.

Ms Davies, who was 44 when she died, was brought up in a middle-class family in North Wales and attended the prestigious Cheltenham Ladies' College.

She was drawn in to the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought after she moved to London for university in 1977.

The group relied on her inheritance to fund itself for many years, leaving her almost penniless, according to the Guardian.

Her cousin Eleri Morgan said that Ms Davies' mother decided to freeze her funds in order to stop her giving all her money to the sect.

'I remember her mother saying, "I had to take the awful decision of freezing her bank account to stop her using that money and going to the cult with it,"' Ms Morgan told The Times.

The Maoists were apparently based for a time in a house in Battersea owned by Ms Davies, before she gave them £10,000 to lease their headquarters in Brixton.

Her family were unaware that she had had a daughter while living with Balakrishnan, and were not told that she had been left paraplegic after falling from a second-storey window.

Members of the sect told her mother that she was on holiday in India, according to the Guardian, and refused to allow doctors to contact her relatives.

Boarded up: The house in South London pictured after the three women escaped last week

One of the three women allegedly held as a slave by a Maoist sect in South London is the daughter of one of the greatest Bletchley Park codebreakers, it has emerged.

The father of Josephine Herivel, 57, was John Herivel, pictured, who was instrumental in deciphering the Nazis' Enigma code during the Second World War.

But by the time he died two years ago, she was apparently estranged from the family after becoming a radical Leftist in the 1970s and being arrested for assault.

Ms Herivel was brought up near Belfast’s so-called 'millionaire row' with her two sisters, Mary and Susan.

Her father John, a brilliant mathematician, was recruited from Cambridge University to break German military ciphers at Bletchley Park in January 1940.

After the war he published a number of books on his work and moved to Belfast to become a lecturer at Queen's University, before retiring to Oxford as a fellow of All Souls College.

In the same year Josephine, then 22, was arrested for assault and obstructing police in London along with a number of young women.When her father died in 2011 obituaries only made mention of his two other daughters, who now live in London.

Last week Rosie Davies, 30, escaped Balakrishnan along with Josephine Herivel, 57, the daughter of a Bletchley Park codebreaker, and Aishah Wahab, 69, who came to Britain from Malaysia as a student.

The three women were set to be formally interviewed by police yesterday after several days of being assessed by psychologists.

Commander Steve Rodhouse said: 'The victims are in the care of specialists who have got great experience of dealing with people who have been subject to trauma.

'We're working to that advice of those experts as to how best to handle those victims, to support them and of course to draw out the evidence we would need to substantiate any prosecution.'

He said that there may have been 'many and varied offences' against the women, who were allegedly held captive at various addresses in London, but that their ordeal may not be defined as slavery.

'We need to maintain an open mind on what this particular incident is before we jump to those conclusions and labels,' Mr Rodhouse said.

But he added: 'The crucial issue for us is that, on the basis of the information that we've had indirectly from victims, clearly criminal offences have been committed. What we need to do now is to understand that in much more detail.'

The commander said that his team had requested documents from the inquest into Ms Davies' death, which was not considered suspicious at the time.

'We have retrieved the court papers, the inquest papers, and we are in the process of reviewing those to see what they can tell us about the police involvement in that inquiry', he said.

'We were not called to the address at the time of Sian's death but we are reviewing what later involvement we had in assisting the coroner to come to that open verdict.'

Yesterday a man who was drawn to the Maoist sect but refused to join the commune said that Balakrishnan, 73, had convinced his followers he was a communist Messiah.

Flying in: Kamar Mautum arrives at Heathrow

The sister of a Malaysian student allegedly enslaved by an extreme Left-wing sect for decades yesterday into Britain to see her 'before either of us dies'.

Retired teacher Kamar Mautum says one of the three captives freed last month is her sibling Aishah Wahab, 69, who disappeared after joining the Maoist faction based in Brixton.

She landed at Heathrow with documents said to prove the captive is her sister and now hopes to see her for the first time in at least 30 years.

As she boarded a flight from Kuala Lumpur to London to be reunited with her sister, Mrs Mautum said: 'I have felt so choked without her for years and years.

'She was so talented; she was the apple of my mother’s eye. She asked for her on her deathbed.'

Miss Wahab is believed to have suffered a stroke while she was allegedly held captive by sect leaders Aravindan Balakrishnan and his partner Chanda.

Her sister added: 'This has been a dark age for her and for all of us. I will do anything to bring her home. I want to see her before either of us dies. I am not sure if she will remember me but I am hopeful she will.

'I hope her health is OK and she is receiving all the help she needs.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
