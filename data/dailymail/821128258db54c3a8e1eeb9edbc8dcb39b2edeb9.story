Tottenham Hotspur fans were left feeling aggrieved on Tuesday afternoon when their team was described as lackadaisical... by search engine Google.

As is customary with the popular website, when you type in a word you are offered some details of its meaning; a definition, some synonyms, and a sentence with the word included in it.

Unfortunately for Spurs fans, they are the butt of the joke in the example sentence. 

A quick Google search of the word 'lackadaisical' reveals an obvious trolling of Tottenham Hotspur

Michel Vorm fetches the ball from his net after Tottenham conceded against Leicester in the FA Cup

Dwight Gayle celebrates his goal for Crystal Palace against Spurs - some more lackadaisical defending

It reads: 'A lackadaisical defence left Spurs adrift in the second half.'

Google confirmed to Sportsmail that the example sentence, and in fact their entire definition service, is provided by Oxford Dictionaries, and is not 'anything sinister' by a cheeky Arsenal fan, as was suggested by some Twitter users.

And if you don't believe us... give it a search.
