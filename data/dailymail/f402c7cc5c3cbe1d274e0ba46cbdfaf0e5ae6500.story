Bothered: Elderly and vulnerable homeowners are being targeted with nuisance calls (posed by model)

Firms that bombard pensioners and Alzheimer’s sufferers with nuisance text messages and cold calls must be reined in, the Information Commissioner says.

Christopher Graham, head of the watchdog responsible for guarding our personal information, said the Government was ‘letting people down’ by refusing to strengthen legislation to stop millions of people being harassed by calls.

He urged ministers to change the law to make it easier to clamp down on unwanted calls and spam texts by companies promising to write off debts, pursue compensation and sell anything from mobile phones to double glazing.

Elderly people and the vulnerable were ‘particularly at risk’ because they are more likely to be cajoled into buying products or services over the phone.

Speaking at an event staged by the Alzheimer’s Society yesterday and attended by justice minister Simon Hughes, Mr Graham said: ‘The current rules around marketing calls are a licence for spammers and scammers.

‘The elderly and vulnerable are particularly at risk, and this can only add to the worries of those who care for them. The Government is letting people down.

‘Time and time again the Government talks about changing the law and clamping down on this problem, but so far it’s just that – talk. We seem to be going round in circles. The Government need to lay the order, change the law and bring in a reform that would make a real difference.’

In October, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid announced a six-week consultation on the issue. He said the law could be changed within 12 weeks of the end of the consultation.

The Information Commissioner’s Office, which is responsible for regulating nuisance marketing calls and spam text messages, can impose fines up to £500,000.

But the watchdog can issue penalties only if it can prove there has been ‘substantial damage or distress’.

Mr Graham wants the burden of proof lowered so he can punish rogue firms.

In December, an insurance firm was fined £90,000 after harassing elderly victims with cold calls. Croydon based boiler insurance company Kwik Fix Plumber Ltd – formerly Boiler Shield Ltd – repeatedly called elderly people, encouraging them to take out policies. Some paid for insurance it appeared they did not need.

In the same month, the organisers of a Manchester music festival were fined £70,000 after sending unsolicited marketing text messages.

The digital junk went to 70,000 people who had bought tickets for the city’s annual Parklife Weekender festival and appeared on recipients’ mobiles to have been sent by ‘Mum’.
