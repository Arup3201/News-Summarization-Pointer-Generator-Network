Brondby and Barcelona are monitoring Daniel Agger's situation at Liverpool following the arrival of Dejan Lovren from Southampton.

The 29-year-old's future is unclear after Lovren's £20million signing and the Danish club hope they can lure the central defender back to the club he grew up at, with their major shareholder saying they will do 'everything in our power' to sign him.

Barcelona have been continually linked with Agger but having splashed out on French defender Jeremy Mathieu last week a deal would have to be right for them to proceed.

Glen Johnson's future also remains uncertain with the player having one year left on contract and no new terms yet to be agreed.

The former Chelsea right back could slip down the pecking order with the imminent arrivals of Javier Manquillo and Alberto Moreno on Merseyside.
