Alvaro Arbeloa has put the brakes on his apparent social media war with Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas - claiming that his retweet of an attack on the 'keeper was a misunderstanding.

The former Liverpool right back spoke out on Twitter to apologise after he reposted a link to a book which called Casillas 'a tumor on Real Madrid.'

That came after his club captain had liked an Instagram post from a fan which criticised Casillas' goalkeeping rival Diego Lopez and called Arbeloa a 'cone' - referring to his lack of mobility.

Real Madrid duo: Club captain Casillas liked an Instagram post criticising Arbeloa before his retort

'I made the mistake of retweeting the guide without having read all 98 pages word for word,' Arbeloa said. Never in my life have I spoken badly about a teammate, and in this instance, I had no intention to do so through an intermediary.

'I apologise to my teammate and captain Iker Casillas, and all fans of Real Madrid who may have been offended.'

In action: Casillas has been out in the US with Real Madrid ahead of the new season in Spain
