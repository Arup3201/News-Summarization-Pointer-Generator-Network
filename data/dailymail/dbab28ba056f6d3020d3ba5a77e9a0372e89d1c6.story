Russia accused the British Government of behaving like ‘hotheads’ as Downing Street indicated it will begin arming the Syrian rebels if dictator Bashar al-Assad refuses to stand down.

Foreign Secretary William Hague led the way in tearing up the European Union arms embargo on Syria at a meeting in Brussels on Monday night.

But Moscow announced that it would send anti-aircraft missiles to the Assad regime to deter other countries from intervening in the civil war, which has already cost 70,000 lives.

The decision to deliver the high 
precision S-300 missiles sparked warnings that Britain would be on a 
collision course with Russia if the UK does arm the rebels.

It came amid reports that President 
Barack Obama had asked military planners at the Pentagon to draw up 
contingency plans for a no-fly zone in Syria.

An American website said a White House
official had confirmed plans are afoot for a no-fly zone to be operated
by Britain, France and the US. This could not be confirmed last night.

No 10 said the lifting of the ban on 
arms sales would give Britain ‘the flexibility to respond if the regime 
refused to negotiate’. A spokesman said: ‘Assad would have to go.’

Russia’s deputy foreign minister 
Sergei Ryabkov said his government understood the concerns about 
providing missiles to Syria but added that it may ‘help restrain some 
hot-heads considering a scenario to give an international dimension to 
this conflict’.

Russia also accused the European Union of ‘throwing fuel on the fire’ by scrapping its arms embargo on Syria.

However, Israel’s defence chief said 
the Russian plan was a ‘threat’ and his country was prepared to use 
force to stop the delivery. There were fears that the Russian and 
European decisions could fuel an arms race in Syria.

Mr Hague said Britain could begin 
arming the rebels immediately but had not yet decided to do so. He 
argued that moderate rebels deserved the chance to defend themselves.
