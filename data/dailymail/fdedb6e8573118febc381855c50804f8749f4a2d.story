A judge has ruled that a Long Island woman who broke up with her boyfriend can keep the $10,000 ring he gave her because he never proposed to her.

The judge said Debbie Lopez of Valley Stream, New York, wasn't bound by a law requiring women to return engagement rings because it was 'given as a gift and not in contemplation of marriage.' 

Joseph Robert Torres, of Yonkers claims he proposed to the mother of his six-year-old son in 2010 at the Rockefeller Center and their son handed her the ring.

But Ms Lopez, 48, told the New York Post: 'When he gave it to me, he said it was a gift for being a great woman, a good mother of his child.'

The attorney for Joseph Robert Torres, of Yonkers, said in court papers that her client was 'stunned' by the ruling.

Rules regarding the ownership of rings can vary state to state.

In certain states, determining who gets the ring rests on who called off the wedding.

Most courts have found that giving an engagement ring on a birthday or a holiday, just makes the ring a simple gift.

Some states say engagement rings are conditional gifts that must be returned to the gift giver if the condition does not take place.

Courts in some states say a gift, once given, cannot be taken back.

There can be an exception in the case of family heirlooms - a ring may be returned to the husband's family if they are family in this case.

Traditionally outside the court of law many people hold that if a woman returns the ring if she cancels the wedding, but keeps it if her fiancé makes the break.

She said Torres asked Lopez to marry him and she said 'absolutel

Lopez wore it on her left ring finger and even told friends 'Maybe, I don't know yet,' when asked if she was engaged, according to court records.

There is no uniform law in the United States regarding engagement rings.

Alton Abramowitz, a New York-based attorney and president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers told CNN that laws vary by state, but many consider the ring a 'conditional gift' until the couple actually get married.

In certain states, determining who gets the ring rests on who called off the wedding and some states treat an engagement ring given on a holiday differently than one given on a non-holiday.

In 2013 NFL star Mario Williams, defensive end for the Buffalo Bills sued his ex-fiancee Erin Marzouki is to get back a $785,000 10-carat diamond engagement ring. 

Eventually the suit was settled and Williams apologized for suing her, while she apologized that text messages from him were released to the media - it is not clear who ended up with the ring.
