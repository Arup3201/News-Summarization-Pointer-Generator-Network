Baked: Jennifer Becker, 49, from Maine, has been charged with furnishing marijuana-laced brownies and endangering the welfare of a child

A Maine woman has been arrested for allegedly giving her 13-year-old daughter brownies laced with marijuana.

Jennifer Becker, 49, from Edgecomb, was arrested Monday and charged with furnishing marijuana and endangering the welfare of a child.

The woman was taken into custody after the Maine Department of Health and Human Services received a complaint claiming that Becker gave her underage daughter baked goods containing cannabis.

The divorced mother of one was taken to the Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset and later released on bail.

A judge has ordered Becker to avoid contact with her 13-year-old daughter, who is now staying with her father in Florida. The mother is due back in court in April, reported Portland Herald Press. 

On her Facebook page, Becker listed her occupation as a hemp farmer; hemp is a commonly used term for high-growing varieties of the Cannabis plant and its related products.

She is also a member of the New England HempCrete - a company that offers environmentally friendly building materials made out of hemp.

Blame game: Becker said her daughter, who 'has issues' told her therapist about the pot-laced brownies, which eventually resulted in her arrest

In an interview with the local station WGME, Becker said her teenage daughter ‘has issues’ and that everything is ‘being blown out of proportion.’

‘She confided to her therapist that she took some [pot brownies] and now here we are,’ the 49-year-old suspect stated.

Maine legalized medical marijuana in 1999, and a decade later the state decriminalized cannabis when Governor John Baldacci signed a bill which made possession of 2.5 ounces or less a civil infraction.

Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form.
