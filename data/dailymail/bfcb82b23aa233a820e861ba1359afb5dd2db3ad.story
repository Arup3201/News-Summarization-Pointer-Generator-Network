An earlier picture of rider Helen Mercer, 26: she sent friends a text on Facebook after the fall saying she was fine

A woman who fell from her horse while taking part in an event had to be cut out of a car after getting inside to recover.

Rider Helen Mercer, 26, is said to have first refused first aid after taking the tumble from her horse when it failed to take a jump.

But after she was taken to sit inside a Peugeot car, belonging to one of the helpers at the annual horse event at Misty Blue Farm at Spennymoor, County Durham, there were fears she might have suffered spinal injuries.

The Yorkshire Air Ambulance was called
 to the farm, and later firefighters removed the car’s doors and peeled
 back its roof so Ms Mercer could be safely removed on a spinal board.

She was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham and it is understood she was discharged having suffered cracked ribs at Sunday's event.

Posting on Facebook she wrote: 'Just to 
let everyone concerned know I am fine, few cracked ribs soft tissue 
damage bruised lung and spleen but otherwise fine.'

One spectator, photographer John Mothersdale, said the rider was lucky not to have been more seriously hurt.

'Her
 horse, which was a big one, probably about 17 hands, went through the 
jump rather than over it and she went over its head,' he said.

'The horse then jumped over her, it would have been a lot worse if it had landed on her.'

Lucky: The horse jumps over Helen, leaving her with only a few bruises

Nikki Skinner who runs the farm said it was a relief she had not suffered a more serious injury.

The
 rider was not wearing body armour while taking part in the annual show 
and Mrs Skinner said the farm is considering making such protection 
compulsory for future competitions.

'We had an emergency staff meeting 
after the incident and we do not feel there is anything we could have 
done differently,' Mrs Skinner said.

'It was just one those unfortunate things that can happen when working with unpredictable animals like horses.

Leaving nothing to chance: emergency crews cut up the car to get the rider our safely

The doors were cut off and the roof peeled open: rider Helen had to be brought out of the car on a spinal board

Better safe than sorry: Air ambulance and firefighter were called to the scene - but the rider turned out to be fine

'It is up to each individual rider whether or not they wear the protection, which does not guarantee safety but is better than wearing no protection at all. We are now reviewing our rules and regulations.'

In July the Great North Air Ambulance flew Laura Tomkins to hospital after she broke her collarbone when she fell from her horse at the same farm.
