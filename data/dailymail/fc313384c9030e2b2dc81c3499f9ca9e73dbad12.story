Long since a favourite with the Royal family, luxury department store Fortnum & Mason has announced the highest profits in its entire 306-year history.

Often referred to as the 'Queen’s grocer', the store managed to buck 2013's bleak high street trend for pretty dismal festive sales figures.

The company announced the incredible profits this week, which showed that sales reached £65m in 2013, up 10 per cent on the previous year, and profit before tax was £1.8m, a five-fold increase on 2012.

Fortnum & Mason has announced the highest profits in its entire 306-year history, despite other high street stores struggling

Together with the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen visited Fortnum's, which has many royal warrants, last year

And despite people still feeling the effect of recent economic hardship, the British public are clearly not afraid to fork out for luxury, with sales of truffles up a whopping 130 per cent, and hand-carved wild salmon up 18 per cent.

For the five weeks up to 5 January 2014, sales were up 16 per cent, which may in part be due to recent re-vamping of the Piccadilly store in 2013, including the launch of a jewellery room and a new room dedicated solely to candles.

As well as the high-quality produce with which Fortnum's is synonymous, part of their festive success is down to their famous hampers, which sold in record numbers this Christmas.

The world-famous hampers were up by 15 per cent, providing the group with the best hamper sales in its 306-year history.

Another cause of the success may be the fact that Fortnum & Mason opened a new store and tea salon located inside St Pancras International statio in November last year

Fortnum's had a brilliant Christmas period, and in the five weeks up to 5 January sales were up 16 per cent

Truffles up 133%

Turkish Delight up 42%

Vintage Port up 26%

Hand carved wild salmon up 18%

Candles up 41%

Ewan Venters, chief executive of Fortnum & Mason, said: 'Christmas at Fortnum's was one of the best yet, both in terms of sales and customer satisfaction.  

'The demand for more bespoke luxurious items, together with the Christmas staples, is at an all-time high, suggesting that consumers still want to treat themselves during the festive period.

‘We continue to invest in the business to provide our customers with the best possible experience, both in our stores and online - another area of significant year on year growth.'

Established in 1707, the Queen's grocer Fortnum & Mason has been a Piccadilly stalwart for 307 years.

The iconic Victorian building in Green Park, the heart of London, is a favourite tourist destination as well as the place well-to-do Londoners shop for luxury hampers and foie gras, or take high tea.

Fortnum & Mason has supplied goods to royalty since 1707 when co-founder William Fortnum was appointed footman in the household of Queen Anne.

Its close association with royalty - and the number of warrants it has received - mean it is one of the most prestigious and exclusive department stores in the world.

A hallmark of luxury and extravagance, hamper sales were up by 15 per cent over the Christmas period as more and more people give them as gifts to impress.
