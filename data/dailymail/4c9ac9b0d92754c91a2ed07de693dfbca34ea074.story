A 52-year-old grandfather is hoping his tattoo depicting 203 characters from popular cartoon series The Simpsons will win him a Guinness World Record.

Michael Baxter has spent almost AU$12,000 on getting inked and has been a big fan of the show since its debut.

His bid to be recognised as a world record holder coincides with the series' 25th anniversary on December 17.

Michael Baxter has 203 characters from popular cartoon series The Simpsons tattooed across his back

The prison officer said he had sat through an eye-watering 130 hours under the needle over the course of a year.

Mr Baxter's favourite character was Homer but his tattoo includes all the main characters - including Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.

Supporting characters - such as Sideshow Bob, the Comic Book Guy, Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner - are littered among the faces that span across Mr Baxter's back.

The tattoo also depicts scenes and locations of Springfield - home of the world's favourite yellow-skinned family - like Moe's Tavern and the famous couch scene of the opening credits.

'I wanted to get something which was unique, which nobody else had or would even think of getting,' Mr Baxter - who hails from Bacchus Marsh near Melbourne - said.

'I'm a huge fan of the show. I love the tattoo, and I know lots of other people, including my grandchildren, do too.'

To claim his record, Mr Baxter has to depose New Zealand's Lee Weir who has the 'most tattoos of the same cartoon character tattooed on the body'.

Mr Weir has 41 tattoos of Homer Simpson on his left arm. 

Despite Mr Baxter's tattoo including lots of different characters, he understands that because all the characters are from the same show, he is eligible to make a claim for the record.

'Guinness have accepted my application, but I have a lot of paperwork to fill out,' he said.

Mr Baxter's tattoo artist, Jade Baxter Smith, has been 'overwhelmed' by the attention she has received over her artwork

Mr Baxter's tattoo has pushed him onto the international stage, with pictures of his tattoos being spread all over the world via the internet.

A campaign has even launched in the U.S. to persuade The Simpsons producers Matt Groening and James L. Brooks to invite him to appear in animated form on the show.

'I'm recognised everywhere. My friends love it, especially the attention it's now getting. They all think the tattoo's awesome, especially when they see it in the flesh,' Mr Baxter said.

'My wife Sharyn, 50, and daughters Michelle, 31 and Rebecka, 29, love it. My seven-year-old grandson Kohen and my five-year-old granddaughter Milah, think it's fantastic.'

Mr Baxter has volunteered to travel with Ms Smith to tattoo expos since the artwork was completed in 2013

Even Mr Baxter's tattoo artist, Jade Baxter Smith, has been 'overwhelmed' by the attention she has received over her artwork.

'I'm known now as the girl who did "that Simpsons tattoo",' she said.

When Mr Baxter first approached Ms Smith with the idea, she did not take him seriously.

'Michael came to me and said he wanted all The Simpsons characters on his back. I laughed and thought he was joking,' the tattoo artist, who has been working since she was 18, said.

Mr Baxter has volunteered to travel with Ms Smith to tattoo expos since the artwork was completed in 2013.

'I'm happy for Jade to use me to promote her work. We've got the Melbourne expo this week. I go and people take photos,' he said.
