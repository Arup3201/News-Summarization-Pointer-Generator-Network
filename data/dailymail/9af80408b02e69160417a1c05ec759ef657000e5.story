This is the ravaged face of a young woman whose dreams of becoming an air hostess were shattered after she got hooked on a legal party drug.

Mikaila Tyhurst, from Crumpsall, Manchester, was an attractive blonde with clear skin, good teeth and a career plan at the age of 18.

But after becoming hooked on the legal high GBL, she suffered severe liver damage - and ended up on life support a staggering 15 times.

During her addiction, her skin became blotchy and covered in spots, her eyes grew puffy and her hair turned a mousey shade of brown.

Meanwhile, her front teeth were knocked out when she fell over during one drug-fuelled night.

GBL - or gamma butyrolactone - is a component of some paint strippers, nail varnish removers and superglue solvents. It gives users a feeling of euphoria, but can also reduce their inhibitions and produce a sense of drowsiness.

Now aged 27, Ms Tyhurst says she has been off the drug for two years - and is 
determined to get her life back on track.

The recovering addict, whose 18-month-old daughter was taken away from her at the height of her drug abuse, has also spoken of her hope that she will soon be reunited with her child once again.Â 

'I
 am ashamed to admit I loved GBL more than her,' she said. 'I will never
 forgive myself for letting drugs come between me and my daughter.

GBL - or gamma butyrolactone - is a 
component of some paint strippers, nail varnish removers and superglue 
solvents.

It gives users a feeling of euphoria, but can also reduce 
their inhibitions and produce a sense of drowsiness.

The drug was made illegal by the Government in December 2009, but is still possible to obtain online as a cheap industrial cleaner.

'I missed the most precious years of her life, but I am determined to make it up to her.'

Ms Tyhurst, who dreamed of becoming an air hostess, became hooked on GBL - which was made illegal by the Government in December 2009 - in 2005.

For the next four years, she was taken to hospital nearly 1,000 times - and was close to death on 15 occasions.

She only stopped taking the drug after doctors warned her that, if she didn't, she was likely to die.

'I was put on a life support machine 15 times and I lost my front teeth after falling onto a pavement while on GBL,' she told Closer magazine.

'Doctors told me that, if I did GBL or drank alcohol again, I would be dead. It was a real wake-up call.

'No one had ever told me I could die from it. I could not believe I had let it get this far.'

New life: Ms Tyhurst, pictured today, has now been clean for two years - and is determined to get her life back

Because of her addiction, Ms Tyhurst's life expectancy had been reduced by at least ten years - and she admits she looks far older than other women in their twenties.

Meanwhile, her liver is currently operating at a level of just 11 per cent - meaning she will need a transplant in the future.

But Ms Tyhurst believes she has been given second chance after being placed on a detox programme and given medication to flush out toxins from her liver.

Recovering: However, her liver is only operating at a level of 11 per cent - meaning she will need a transplant

'I have turned my life around, but now I need a new liver and there is no guarantee I will get one,' said Ms Tyhurst, who is now hoping for a career as a drug and alcohol counsellor,

Although the Government has made GBL illegal, it is still possible to obtain the Class C drug online as a cheap industrial cleaner.

New figures reveal more than 50 people die every year after taking legal highs.
