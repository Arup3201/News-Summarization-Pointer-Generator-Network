The X Factor has been criticised by fans for ‘shamelessly’ plugging sponsors’ products  on last Saturday’s programme.

During the two-hour ITV talent show, contestants were repeatedly shown using Samsung products  – and on another occasion, a TV catch-up service from another sponsor was featured.

The first sighting of an item provided by electronics giant Samsung came within minutes – when boy-band Rough Copy used what appeared to be one of its smart cameras to take pictures of themselves at a film premiere.

Soon afterwards singers Abi Alton and Luke Friend had photos taken with the brand’s mobile phones.

Other contestants were then shown using Samsung’s tablet – including Nicholas McDonald, who made a video call to his mother, and Tamera Foster, who watched a video with mentor Nicole Scherzinger.

Boy-band Kingsland Road later reviewed their performance using the subscription-free TV service, YouView, from another show sponsor, TalkTalk.

Fans expressed their anger on Twitter. Aisha Mohammed wrote: ‘I hate X Factor for their shameless product placement’.

And Phil Holmes said he had developed a new game counting ‘how many times X Factor can shoehorn in’ Samsung products.

Product placement has been allowed on UK TV programmes since February 2011.

But regulator Ofcom stipulates there must be ‘editorial justification’ for a product – meaning content should not seem manipulated or distorted in order to include it.

An ITV spokesman said: ‘Editorial integrity is at the  heart of what we do. Product placement on The X Factor complies with all regulations.’
