More than ten new alleged victims of entertainer Rolf Harris have come forward, it has been claimed

More than ten new alleged victims of disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris have come forward to claim he abused them, it has been reported.

The claims relate to allegations in Australia, New Zealand and in Britain, a police source has revealed.

Many of the victims are understood to have been underage at the time of the alleged abuse, which could mean Harris will face fresh charges. 

Operation Yewtree will deal with allegations relating to British victims, while those made abroad will be handled by local police, the Sunday Times reports. 

Harris was convicted of 12 indecent assaults on June 30 at Southwark Crown Court by Mr Justice Sweeney - one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years.

During the trial, Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls.

Jurors were told how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend ‘haunted’ her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide.

Passing sentence, Justice Sweeney said: 'You have shown no remorse for your crimes at all. Your reputation now lies in ruins, you have been stripped of your honours but you have no one to blame but yourself.' 

His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE.

The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.

He was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which spanned between 1968 and 1986.

Detective Chief Inspector Michael Orchard of the Met Police said that new claims had emerged during the course of the trial.

It was recently reported that the 84-year-old has been transferred to Stafford jail, which has two separate wings for 'vulnerable' sex offenders, from HMP Bullingdon, in Oxfordshire.

He was moved prison following a number of incidents where he was targeted by fellow inmates.
