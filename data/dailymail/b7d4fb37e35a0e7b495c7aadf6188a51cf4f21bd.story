Religious figure: Alan John Miller says he 'remembered' in 2004 that he was Jesus Christ

A former IT specialist who claims that he is Jesus Christ has attracted a following in his native Australia from as far afield as Britain and the U.S.

Alan John Miller, 50, says that not only is he Jesus, but his girlfriend Mary Luck is Mary Magdalene, who according to the Bible was present at the crucifixion.

In one recording he says: 'There's 
probably a million people who say they're Jesus and most of them are in 
asylums.

'But one of us has to be. How do I know I am?

Because I remember
 everything about my life.'

Mr Miller has 'very clear memories' of his crucifixion 2,000 years ago, but claims that he only 'remembered' that he was Jesus in 2004.Â 

He explains on his Divine Truth website that he and 'other
 Celestial Angels' tried to convey divine truth to an American man named James 
Padgett between 1914-23 in New York.

However, 'unfortunately, no-one really fully understood the message 
that was given.'

So Mr Miller and Mary Magdalene 
'found a way to return to earth to demonstrate these Truths', with '7 
soul pairs, or 14 people', to teach people themselves.

Miller, a divorced father-of-two, said his first marriage broke down when he 'began to remember details' of the incarnation.

Mr Miller now runs his Divine Truth church from his home near the small town of Kingaroy in the state of Queensland.

He can attract up to 150 people to his sermons.

Mr Miller and Miss Luck do not have conventional employment and their lifestyles appear to be funded by supporter donations though they say that followers are not pressed to give money.

However, followers are encouraged to give money to them and British woman Louise 'Luli' Faver, 39, is a former neuroscientist who has given up her career to be closer to the couple.

The Divine Truth website says: 'Luli does not have any other source of income aside from your donations and gifts, and she provides every service free-of-charge. Your donations in this section go directly towards Luli's living expenses. This allows Luli to do her voluntary work full-time.'

Through DVDs, the internet and personal appearances AJ Miller is spreading his word globally.

Another disciple, George Hamel, moved from California, leaving behind his wife and businesses so he can be closer to Mr Miller.

Some 30 devoted followers have bought up much of the land surrounding Miller's compound, where he has been living since 2007.
