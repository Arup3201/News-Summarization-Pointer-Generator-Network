For most planning to study in London, the high cost of accommodation is an unavoidable burden.

But the Tindle family have come up with a novel way to get out of paying thousands on student halls for their daughter – by buying her a narrowboat.

Instead of paying for expensive halls in the capital, Charlotte, 18, will live on the three-bed barge while she studies for her music production degree.

Miss Tindle, a keen musician, and her parents, Harry and Gill, spent the summer refurbishing the vessel, to include glamorous black and white decoration and furnishings.

The student accommodation suggested by the Tech Music School in Fulham, south west London, where Miss Tindle will study, cost £1,000 a month – so around £36,000 for her three-year degree.

To buy the boat and carry out the renovation cost the family £37,000 – so around the same it would cost to pay for student halls for three years.

But Mr and Mrs Tindle plan to sell the boat when their daughter graduates and expect it to fetch at least £40,000 – therefore making a profit.

Miss Tindle, who hopes to be at their destination, Brentford Island Marina, within ten days, before the start of term on September 29, said: ‘It’s so exciting. The boat’s been done up so nicely with ashwood interior.

'It’s such a luxury and glam place to be and something to be proud of.’

She has her own room with double bed, a dining room with a table turning into another double bed and a lounge with a large sofa bed.

The kitchen boasts all mod cons including cooker, fridge, microwave and washing machine and the trendy bathroom with black sparkly floor and white walls features a corner power shower

There is also a 32-inch flat screen in the lounge, Beatles' pillows and an internet hotspot for her laptop

Miss Tindle may even earn extra cash by looking for a house-mate to share the boat with.

This would cover the mooring costs, which are expected to be an additional £5,000 to £6,000 a year.

Speaking yesterday from her new floating home, as she travelled through Leicestershire, she said the idea was her father’s.

‘He mentioned it to me but I was a little bit unsure at first, then I warmed to it. I’ll probably be the envy of all the other students!’ she said.

Once they arrive in London, Miss Tindle's parents will stay with her until they find a mooring spot in a marina, before returning home

Miss Tindle said: ‘It’s called Alleluja, quite a fitting name and it’s staying. It’s bad luck to change name until a boat’s been taken out of the water and this one hasn’t.’

Once they arrive in London, Miss Tindle’s parents will stay with her until they find a mooring spot in a marina, before returning home.

She has been living in Leicester Marina for the past week to get used to her new home.

‘I was most worried about being in the dark, but as soon as I was here, I felt safe. I feel like it is my home,’ she said.

All aboard: Charlotte is currently navigating her way down south with her parents, Harry and Gill

Mr Tindle, who owns a design consultancy, said the trip down to London is the family's summer holiday this year

Mr Tindle said his friend used to live on a narrowboat and it struck him as a nice place for Charlotte to live.

‘I thought it would be a suitable alternative. Charlotte has the right character to do this,’ he said.

‘Myself and my wife, Gill, have been working on it and we have been taken in by the boating scene. Everyone seems helpful. It seemed a better environment for Charlotte to live in, instead of a basement bedsit.

‘I would be more worried about Charlotte in a bedsit in a dodgy area of London on her own than living in a lovely marina.

‘It might be a bit more unusual, but it makes sense to me.’

Mr Tindle, who owns a design consultancy, added that the trip down to London is their summer holiday this year.

‘It has turned in to an adventure. I have stuck a couple of Leicester Foxes on the front of the boat for good luck.'
