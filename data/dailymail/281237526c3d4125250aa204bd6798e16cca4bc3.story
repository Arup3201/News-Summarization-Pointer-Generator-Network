The names of blue chip companies that used rogue private detectives will finally be revealed next week.

MPs have given police a five-day deadline to release the list of 102 law firms, insurers, financial companies, banks and celebrities.

If they fail to do so, the names will be published in Parliament on Monday.

Ultimatum: Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said he would publish the list of names next week if Soca refused to do so

The MPs are furious that the Serious Organised Crime Agency has refused to identify the organisations who were clients of corrupt investigators.

The move could spark a major row between Parliament and police, who handed the list to the Commons home affairs committee on condition of strict confidence.

Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who is chairman of the committee, issued the deadline to Soca at a stormy meeting yesterday.

His colleagues warned Soca that, by 
appearing to be protecting the identities of the big businesses on the 
list, they were giving the impression of ‘injustice’.

It
 was pointed out to police chiefs that, when journalists had been linked
 to phone hacking and other illegal practices, police had pursued them 
relentlessly.

But, in the four years since Soca discovered that big business and lawyers had – often indirectly – been clients of rogue detectives  little or nothing has been done.

Mr Vaz told Trevor Pearce, Soca’s director general, and Stephen Rimmer, the agency’s interim chairman, that he would publish the list on Monday if Soca did not do so first.

‘The committee has taken the view that this list should be published,’ he said. ‘We would like you to publish the list. We see nothing wrong with you publishing the list.

‘We know it has gone to the Metropolitan Police and we know they have removed the names that are subject to criminal investigation.

‘We give you until Monday to publish this list, if you fail to publish it on Monday, we will publish it because we think it is in the public interest to do so. We’ve taken legal advice.’

The ‘blue-chip hacking’ list was drawn up during Soca’s Operation Millipede, which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year.

Twenty-two law firms feature alongside several insurance companies, financial services groups and two celebrities.

Up to 100 individuals may have had their details accessed by the private investigators, Mr Pearce previously admitted.

Conservative MP Michael Ellis asked him yesterday: ‘The impression is given in some quarters that it’s alright to pursue journalists for offences or alleged offences but not so when it comes to large City institutions or any other entity that might be of a different nature.

‘So isn’t it in the public interest also to avoid those sort of impressions being created, of injustice?

‘There is also public interest in not giving the impression that there is an uneven scale of justice applying to different entities.

‘We have to protect the wider interests of justice here and that includes that justice be seen to be done as well as actually being done.’

The Northampton North MP added: ‘Why shouldn’t the public know the names?

‘There doesn’t seem to me to be any issues of national security or other issues pertaining to the wider national interest.’

The MPs even suggested Soca had not checked whether its board members hold directorships or receive other payments from the 102 firms on the list. If any links are confirmed, this could constitute a major conflict of interest, the MPs said.

Last night, a Soca spokesman said: ‘We have made our position clear, but in light of the request from the committee we will seek advice and inform the committee of our decision by Friday.’

Millipede resulted in the jailing of rogue private detectives Daniel Summers, Philip Campbell Smith, Graham Freeman and Adam John Spears.

The four men used a range of deception techniques to obtain bank account and mortgage details, medical records and information from the Police National Computer.

MPs said names on the list had begun to leak out – with six firms publicly identified last month.They were the accountants, Deloitte, banks Credit Suisse and Chase International, and legal firms Richards Butler, Herbert Smith and Clyde & Co.

There is no evidence they knew of any criminal activity.

Deloitte and Clyde & Co denied hiring private investigators who acted illegally. The other four named companies declined to comment.

Earlier this week, it emerged that – after a four-year delay – the firms on the list are to face an investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office.

The maximum penalty any of the companies and individuals involved could face if successfully prosecuted for data protection breaches is a fine.

Some would not face any court action, however, because they are based abroad.
