Sobbing, Lydia, 16, and her younger siblings Blessing, 11, Pauline, nine, and Paul, five, can only watch as the body of their mother is taken away.

Dressed in hazard suits that cover them from head to toe, the men loading the plastic-wrapped corpse onto a truck are a grim sight.

But they, like the plastic wrap that shrouds the body, are necessary for Juana, 45, like thousands of others in her native Liberia, died from the deadly Ebola virus.

With 2,909 deaths and 6,185 cases of the disease reported in Liberia, Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone so far, Ebola orphans are, sadly, not unusual.

But with neighbours and extended families reluctant to take the children in for fear of succumbing to the disease themselves, Plan International says the future is bleak for the youngsters affected.

'The large number of 
single-parent families in Liberia means that as mothers are dying from 
Ebola, children lose their sole care-giver, and have no-one to look 
after them,' explains Koala 
Oumarou, Country Director for Plan Liberia.

'Once
 their mother dies, the orphaned children have to leave school, if they 
were in school in the first place.

'They are ostracised by the community,
 and they have to work, to try to make a living and support themselves.'

Alone: With help from her grandmother, 68, Lydia, 16, will now care for her younger siblings

Ebola has 
so far claimed 1,137 lives in Liberia, according to the World Health Organisation, among them
 scores of single mothers who have left young families behind.

Since

 the civil war that ended in 2003, the country has been plagued by 
social problems, with broken, one-parent families becoming the norm, as 
traumatised, 
unemployed men reject marriage and family values.

Now,
 according to government sources, up to 300 children are struggling to 
cope after losing their mothers to the epidemic.

In
 Bomi County near Monrovia, an area particularly badly affected by years of civil war, an estimated 75 per cent of women
 with children are single mothers, while nationally, single parents account for fully half of the country's families.

It's a situation that is all too familiar for Lydia, herself a single mother of one, and her siblings, who live in the isolated village of Voijama in northern Liberia.

With four different fathers, none of whom are on the scene, and only their elderly grandmother to look after them, none have much hope for the future or faith in their extended family.

Terrified: With 1,137 already dead from the disease in Liberia, people are becoming increasingly frightened

'We’ve not seen anyone as a father since we were born,' says the heart-breakingly grown-up Pauline, nine.

Lydia
 agrees. 'We have not seen any family member before our mother died, 
besides our grandmother,' she reveals.

Their grandmother, Sonnie, 68, is doing her best to care for the children but, well into old age, is unable to work and struggles to keep up with her boisterous grandson.

'I will find it difficult at my age to fully cater to these children, now that I am not working again,' she admits.

'I
 was one of many traditional midwives who the government forcibly retired, on the grounds that we were illiterate. I am also too old to do
 farm work or cleaning work.'

Neigbours, terrified of succumbing to Ebola themselves, have refused to help, which means that the bulk of the childcare now falls to Lydia, who has had to leave school to take care of her siblings.

Help: The shocked and grieving children say they would like their extended family to come to their aid

And with money tight, her younger siblings have also had to give up their education - much to aspiring teacher Pauline's distress.

'I’d
 love to be a teacher in the future like my mother once was,' she admits, 'but with all this going on, becoming a teacher will not happen.'

Worst of all though, is the social stigma that they now face following their mother's death. 'These 
children are really stigmatised by Ebola,' adds Oumarou.

'Many families just do not 
want to help them after their parents die because they are scared of 
contracting the disease. But these children are in dire need of 
assistance.'

'Extended
 families don’t want to take care of orphans of affected parents or 
other vulnerable children anymore out of fear of being contaminated or 
stigmatised in the community,' adds child protection specialist, Anita Queirazza.

'Some
 foster families have abandoned orphans after receiving the accompanying
 food and non-food assistance, leaving the children to fend for 
themselves.'

As for Lydia and her siblings, still struggling to come to terms with their mother's death, the future remains uncertain.

'I have my own responsibilities, and now
 that of my little brother and sisters,' she says, adding: 'We’d be happy to have any relative 
or family member come to assist us.'
