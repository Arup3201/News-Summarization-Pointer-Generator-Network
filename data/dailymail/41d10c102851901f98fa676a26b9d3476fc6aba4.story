Heather Watson threw away three match points as she was knocked out of the Aegon Classic first round on Tuesday.

Not quite the start  to the grass-court season watching Fed Cup captain Judy Murray may have had in mind.

The British No 1 dominated the first set against Aleksandra Wozniak from Canada, a player 66  places below her in the world rankings, but then squandered a 4-1 lead in the second and failed to close out the match on her own serve.

The 22-year-old from Guernsey battled back from 3-0 down in the final set to level at 4-4, but Wozniak, 26, needed only one match point to seal the clash.

Watson insisted defeat at Edgbaston will not disrupt her preparations for Wimbledon, where she will largely carry British hopes in the women’s draw in the absence of Laura Robson, who had wrist surgery in April. Watson, the world No 69, said: ‘No, it’s just a match. You know, I’m still alive. It’s no big deal.

‘About the middle of the second set I stopped serving as well, so then I got pushed back and wasn’t playing as aggressively as I wanted to. She definitely improved her game. At the beginning she was making a lot of unforced errors, and then in the third set she played unbelievable. She was hitting lines and net cords. There wasn’t much I could do.’

None of the world’s top 20 women have a full-time female coach but Wozniak works with 1998 Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat. Watson, however, who is coached by Argentinian Diego Veronelli, is clearly already fed up of the fuss surrounding Andy Murray’s decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo.

‘I think I don’t really care if you’re male or female,’ she said. ‘I don’t see the big deal. Everybody is a making a big deal out of being female.’

Wozniak will now face Johanna Konta in the second round after the 23-year-old Briton beat  Japanese 14th seed Kurumi Nara 6-3, 6-1.

Konta said: ‘I felt I played quite a solid match. The first rounds of a tournament can always be a bit more nerve-racking, so I’m just happy that I took care of business on my end.’

But there was disappointment for Watson’s doubles partner Naomi Broady, who also went ahead before losing 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 to Barbora Zahlavova Strycova from the Czech Republic.

Broady will be among the British players hoping for a Wimbledon wildcard when they are announced on Wednesday. The 24-year-old admitted the guaranteed £27,000 in prize money if she could progress through qualifying to secure a first-round match at the All England Club would be particularly welcome.

She said: ‘This time last year I started looking into other things I could do because I couldn’t financially fund myself at all.

‘If it wasn’t for my Wimbledon wildcard last year, I couldn’t be playing now. I would have stopped last year because I can’t financially afford to play tennis. The prize-money would help my tennis. It would be an amazing opportunity. As long as I didn’t play one of the very top seeds, I would fancy my chances if I serve well.’

Daniela Hantuchova, the defending champion at the Aegon Classic, progressed to the third round after a straight sets win against 17-year-old Belinda Bencic from Switzerland, while No 1 seed Ana Ivanovic beat Mona Barthel from Germany 6-4, 6-1.

Struggling: Naomi Broady also exited the AEGON Classic and will hope to be given a Wimbledon wildcard
