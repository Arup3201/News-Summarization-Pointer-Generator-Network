It seems Prince George's brother or sister is driving consumer sales and shopping trends even before he or she is born. 

In an effort to emulate the Duchess of Cambridge's seemingly effortless pregnancy style and grace, mothers-to-be are flocking to have their own pregnancy captured, with a 43 per cent rise in 'bump portraits'.

So desperate are they to copy Kate's pre-natal look that some women are even coming into the photography studio clutching pictures of the young royal, hoping to exactly mimic her hands-under-the-bump pose.

Venture Studios has reported a 43 per cent year-or-year increase in women seeking 'bump portraits' during November, December and the first few weeks of January after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced they were expecting their second child.

The photographic styling and age-group representative of this demand also suggests that the increase has been down to the 'Kate effect'.

Demand for 'bump portraits' has been particularly marked amongst mothers-to-be in their 30s, with a 57 per cent increase in orders from this age group.

Kate's demure yet elegant maternity fashion has inspired a move away from highly staged Demi Moore reminiscent shots to very natural, traditional portraits, such as the picture of Caroline Wade (left) and Deborah Lally, 8 months pregnant 

Kate's fashion choices during her first pregnancy with Prince George were widely praised and expelled the idea that maternity wear meant tent-like dresses and elasticated waist bands. 

This, coupled with having seen Kate's pregnancy documented on camera at every stage, has inspired other women to make a lasting record of their own maternity journey.

This is reflected in the style of portrait requested has also been significant, with a move away from highly staged Demi Moore reminiscent shots to very natural, traditional portraits celebrating mothers' individual looks, similar to the manner that we see the expectant Kate at public events.

A number of pregnant women have even arrived at their shoots clutching pictures of Kate and her bump to recreate her specific pose and look.

High fashion is now very much embraced by pregnant women (such as Sazia Samad) thanks to Kate's example

Richard Mayfield, Creative Director for Venture Studios, said; 'Since November we have seen a notable increase in portraits of pregnant women at our studios - especially amongst those in their 30s.

'Women not only want to mark this important moment in their lives, they are also more confident about being themselves and maintaining their individual styles - even with a changing body shape. 

'Celebrities such as Kate Middleton who actually incorporate their bumps into their usual glamorous look has perhaps inspired women and reassured them that they can still look amazing and make the most of fashion even when pregnant.'

The Kate effect also applies to the Duchess's fashion choices with the £195 'Natasha' coat by Séraphine which the Duchess wore earlier this week having sold out 

Caroline Wade, 35, a PR and portrait painter from Muswell Hill in London is four months pregnant and says the Duchess inspired her to have a fashionable pregnancy and to capture it on camera. 

'After spending most of my adult life controlling my figure, the fact that your stomach is meant to stick out in pregnancy is an interesting shift in perspective! 

'It reminds you that what your body can do is so much more powerful than how it looks. 

'I have to say all the coverage of Kate being pregnant and glamorous inspired me to do the shoot. I didn't expect to still feel attractive when I was pregnant but it is still you, just you with a bump.

'It is also easier at this early stage to look good as you can still mix and match your normal clothes with maternity things as Kate has been doing.'
