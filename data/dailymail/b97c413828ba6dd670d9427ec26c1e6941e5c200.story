Last month, a keen art lover spent $3,500 (£2,181) at an auction house in New York – but took nothing home.

That’s because Benjamin Palmer had in fact purchased ifnoyes.com, a web page with geometric patterns that change in response to mouse movement.

It may seem like a steep price for something that only exists in a mass of wires, but the website is part of a growing trend establishing itself in the art world.

The movement in digital art can be traced back to the mid-20th Century where the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition in London highlighted the world of computer artists.

Today, art and technology are becoming far more integrated, with artists using tools such as plastic electronics, advanced computing and 3D printing to create their vision.

Experts claim that the latest auction at Philips auction house in New York is a sign that the art world is really beginning to take digital projects seriously.

The Paddles On auction displayed 20 pieces of digitally inspired art, attracted 500 visitors and raised a total of $90,600. This piece was  created by Steve Turner in 2011

Named Paddles On, the auction displayed 20 pieces of digitally inspired art, attracted 500 visitors and raised a total of $90,600 (£56,476).

The pieces covered both the physical and digital realm and included items such as a baroque chandelier with surveillance cameras instead of lights and a digital print with embedded touchscreen tablets.

One highlight was an eight-hour performance video by Tumblr artist Molly Soda using an animated GIF.

The website ifnoyes.com sold for the highest price of $3,500 (£2,181) and was created by Dutch-Brazilian artist Rafaël Rozendaal.

It was purchased under a specially designed ‘Art Website Sales Contract’.

This means that Mr Palmer, now the owner of the domain name, has to keep the website ‘online and completely accessible to the public.’

The curators say they are excited by freedom that digital art can provide, as well as the popularity of the auction.

They hope that, with the internet as a canvas, far more artists will move into the digital realm.
