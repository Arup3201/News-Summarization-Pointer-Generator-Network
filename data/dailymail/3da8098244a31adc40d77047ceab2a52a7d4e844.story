A German taxi driver who misheard his drunken passenger asking to be taken home, ended up taking him to Belgium by mistake.

The nightclub reveller had stumbled into the taxi in the town of Aachen, Germany, demanding to be taken 'nach hause', (home) to the nearby district of Herzogenrath.

But instead the cabbie took him to 'Hauset' a small village several miles across the border into Belgium.

Detour: A German taxi driver misheard a drunken passenger's request to be taken home and took him to Belgium by mistake

It was not until they arrived that the drunken passenger realised he was actually in the wrong country and far from home.

When they eventually made it to the right destination, the reveller was slapped with a bill for 70 Euros (£60).

But he didn't have the money to cover the fare and simply stumbled into his house without paying.

The man has now been told he faces fraud charges after the furious ctaxi driver reported the matteer to the police.
