A series of high-profile leaks have revealed how easy it can be for governments, organisations and cybercriminals to track what we’re doing online.

And while Android devices have been able to make free encrypted calls and texts for some time, the feature has been lacking on Apple handsets - until now.

Signal is the first iOS app to let users make secure calls over the internet without passwords, call codes, or monthly subscriptions.

Signal developed by San Francisco-based Open WhisperSystem uses a person’s existing number and contacts (pictured left). The first time the app is used, a caller verifies their device using a one-time SMS code. During a call Signal then displays two random words on the screen of both users (right) to verify caller identities

Signal was developed by Open WhisperSystems and uses a person’s existing phone number and contacts.

Video calls over the internet are easier to hack and intercept than regular phone calls.

To make them more secure, app developers use what’s called the ZRTP protocol. 

Z refers to the protocols inventor, Phil Zimmermann, while RTP stands for Real-time Transport Protocol.

It uses a variety of cryptographic tools to scramble calls and make them harder to listen in on.

Signal, for example, additionally displays two words on the screen during a call.

These are used to verify who the two callers are, and to make sure people can’t join the call in what’s known as a ‘man-in-the-middle’ attack. 

A caller is asked to verify their device the first time they use the app, via a one-time SMS code, and then can use the app without entering a username or password.

During a call, Signal then displays two random words on the screen of both users.

These are used to verify who the two callers are, and to make sure people can’t join the call in what’s known as a ‘man-in-the-middle’ attack.

On a deeper security level, the app uses what’s known as ZRTP.

Z refers to the protocol’s inventor, Phil Zimmermann, while RTP stands for Real-time Transport Protocol.

It uses a number of cryptographic features to scramble calls and make them harder to listen in on.

Signal is the first free voice call encryption app to launch on iOS. There are other apps available, namely Silent Circle’s Silent Phone and Silent Text (pictured), but these services start at $12.95 (£7.70) per month

San Francisco-based Open WhisperSystems already makes RedPhone, which encrypts calls on Android devices (pictured)

‘At Open Whisper Systems, we want everyone to have access to advanced secure communication tools that are as easy and reliable to use as making a normal phone call or sending a normal text message,' explained the developers in a blog post. 

‘Over the past year, we've been working to bring the privacy software we've developed for Android to the iPhone, and today we’re releasing Signal – free, worldwide, encrypted voice calls for iPhone.’

San Francisco-based Open WhisperSystems already makes TextSecure and RedPhone, which encrypts texts messages and calls, respectively, on Android devices.

Signal is the first free voice call encryption app to launch on iOS.

It is also open source, and the firm encourages developers to audit the code and suggest improvements to make sure the code hasn't been compromised or hacked by cybercriminals or organisations.

There are other apps available, namely Silent Circle’s Silent Phone and Silent Text, but these services start at $12.95 (£7.70) per month.
