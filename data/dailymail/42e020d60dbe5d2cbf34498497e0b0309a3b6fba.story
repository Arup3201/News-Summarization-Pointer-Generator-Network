A blundering council has apologised to a pensioner - after declaring she was dead.

Exeter City Council wrote to the executors of Florence Matthias to inform them they had stopped her Council Tax support and Housing benefit from mid July.

The letter from the council’s Benefit Development Officer said: 'The reason the benefit has stopped is because Mrs Matthias has sadly passed away.'

The letter was sent to her home in Exeter, Devon, addressed to ‘Exor Florence Matthias’.

The family of the 86 year old pensioner was furious and demanded an explanation from the council.

Her son Michael said: 'My mother is not in the best of health and this has caused her a lot of anxiety. We are annoyed too.

'Someone at the council has made a bad mistake and has caused my mother upset and confusion.

'She actually asked my brother ‘am I dead now ?'

An Exeter City Council spokesman said: “The council regrets that the letter was sent to Mrs Matthias because of an oversight by a member of staff.

'We have responded to a complaint from a member of Mrs Matthias’ family with a formal apology for any distress caused and we have apologised personally to Mrs Matthias.

'We have reviewed our procedures and reminded all staff about attention to detail.'
