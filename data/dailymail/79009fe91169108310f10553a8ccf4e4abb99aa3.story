People often worry about things that go bump in the night and not what happens to our plants while we sleep.

But that has been an ongoing problem for residents in Hornchuch, east London for the last year.

That is until they captured a middle-aged man tugging up flowers by their roots.

The man can be seen walking past and looking into the front garden in Hornchurch, east London

He is then seen leaning over the iron railing, separating the garden and the pavement and grabbing a plant

He then throws the torn up shrub back into the flower bed whilst looking to see if he has been spotted

Footage caught the man pulling up the shrubs, which included Laurels and Privets, and then throwing them back to the ground.

A concerned resident set on solving the mystery installed CCTV cameras outside his home.

It was after he fell victim to a string of criminal damage incidents in his garden and to his car.

The footage was captured on Saturday, July 26 at about 1.50am and revealed a man tampering with his flowers.

He walks further down the garden and pulls up another plant before tossing it back into the flowerbed

Police have released the images in the hope that someone might recognise the man or have any information

Officers are continuing to investigate multiple incidents of criminal damage to vehicles in the area and are looking into the possibility more than one person may be responsible.

They have now released the footage in a bid to track down the man captured in the images.

Police Sergeant Darren Hepple of Hacton Safer Neighbourhoods Team said: ‘There have been several reports of criminal damage of a similar nature in the area and we believe that one person may be responsible.

‘I am asking for the public's assistance to help us identify this person and anyone with information on the damage - or who recognises the male in the CCTV - should contact us directly.’

Anyone who can identify the man shown in the footage should contact Police on 020 8721 2593 or 101 quoting ref 5411013/14 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 111 555.
