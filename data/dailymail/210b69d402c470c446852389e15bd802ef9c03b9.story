From hot flushes to hormone-induced breakouts, the menopause can play havoc on your skin as well as your temper.

But although there's an abundance of advice on what food to eat and which herbal remedies to take, little attention has been paid to looking good - until now.

Celebrity make-up artist Lisa Eldridge, who has worked with Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet among others, has come to the rescue with a beauty tutorial that reveals how to hide those hot flushes - and look in tip-top shape at the same time.

Before and after: Lisa Eldridge, a celebrity make-up artist who has worked with Cara Delevingne, has treated her friend suffering from the menopause to a makeover and shared her top tips for combating the signs

'While chatting with a friend who’s been having menopausal make-up issues, I realised there isn’t a lot of discussion or advice around this subject,' explains Eldridge.

'This film hopefully breaks that taboo with some useful tips, warm friendly advice and a good sprinkling of humour.'

The perfect menopausal make-up look begins with a good base, in Eldridge's case, Embryolisse Lait Creme Concentre and Laura Mercier Foundation Primer.

Next comes a layer of BB cream - Eldridge likes Estée Lauder Double Wear All Day Glow BB Moisture Make-up - which, Eldridge says, will give mature skin plenty of nourishment while staying in place all day.

'If you happen to have a hot flush, this really will stay on,' adds Eldridge. 'Although it has a setting feeling, you can feel it's long-lasting and it leaves a dewy finish.'

Tips and tricks: Lisa says that the right coverage is important for ladies who get hot flushes and perspire a lot, she recommends a BB cream and concealer stick for on the go

For those dealing with greasy skin, Eldridge has this advice: 'If you're having a greasy reaction to the menopause and your skin is oily because your hormones are going out of whack, then something like Estée Lauder's Double Wear Light is good because it will cover rosacea and blemishes.'

Harder to tackle are hot flushes and perspiration, both of which can prove deadly for foundation's staying power.

To beat the sweats, she suggests skipping the BB cream and instead opting for 
Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation Skin, dabbed on in certain areas so that, if
 your make-up does sweat off, you'll only have a few areas to 
touch up.

Next up is concealer, which for Eldridge, means Dior's Hydra Life BB Eye Creme, explaining: 'This is really moisturising so it's fantastic if you're experiencing very dry skin,' she reveals.

'It really lifts shadows without emphasising any fine lines and has some really nice brightening pigments in there.

'Add more to the inner corners of your eyes if you're not sleeping well,' she suggests. 'Also note that pink hued concealers help to counteract blueness and beware that too much highlighter is ageing.'

Lift the face with a dab of blusher, and make it one that contains anti-ageing ingredients such as By Terry's Hyaluronic Blush.

That's a good trick! For lips, she uses a Chanel lipliner and dabs some of the eyeshadow primer above the lips to avoid any smudging or lipstick bleeding

'If you're experiencing the redness that comes with the menopause, skip this step,' advises Eldridge. 'But if you have even-toned skin then a little bit of colour in the face is really beautiful.'

For eyes, Eldridge smooths Urban Decay Anti-Ageing primer all over the lids, which she says is brilliant if you're having a hard time getting shadow to stay put.

Beauty guru: Lisa's handiwork can be seen regularly on runways, red carpets and glossy covers, with a client list that reads like a who's who of Hollywood's most glamorous

She also recommends using waterproof eye make-up, citing Lancôme Kohl Hypnose Waterproof eyeliner as her favourite.

'Smudge it on,' she recommends. 'The messier you put [it on], the better but make sure you get to the roots of the lashes and massage the pencil in there'.

If your lashes are falling out, she says a coat of Urban Decay Cannonball Ultra Waterproof Mascara on the top lashes can help. She also loves Stila eyebrow pencils, which, she says, just won't budge, even if you're wiping your face all day due to perspiration.

On the lips, Eldridge uses a Chanel lipliner and dabs some eyeshadow primer above the lips to avoid any smudging or lipstick bleeding.

Finish off the look with a slick of Rimmel Moisture Renew Lipstick, which, Eldridge says, helps lips look plumper.

'If you want to amp this make-up up, it's better to amp up the eyes,' she says of making the look work for evening. 'The eyes are easier to maintain than skin.'

1.
 Invest in a really good magnifying mirror. No less than 10x -15x 
magnification. You can buy ones that attach easily to your bathroom 
mirror and smaller travel ones for your handbag.

2. If you are experiencing a lot of hot 
flushes, apply as little base make-up as you feel comfortable 
with. That way there will be less touching up and patching to do. Carry a
 stick foundation or compact concealer with you for selective touch ups.

3. If you are perspiring a lot, avoid too much powder as water and powder do not mix well.

4. If you are experiencing dry eyes, apply moisturising eye drops at least 10 minutes before starting your make-up.

5. Waterproof eye make-up products are 
technically light years ahead of where they were even a couple of years 
ago. It’s worth investing in the most up to date formulations for 
mascara and eye liner.

6. Keep a cold, clean chamois leather in
 the fridge to cool your face down. You can also keep a small version of
 something like this in your bag to absorb sweat without disturbing your
 make-up.
