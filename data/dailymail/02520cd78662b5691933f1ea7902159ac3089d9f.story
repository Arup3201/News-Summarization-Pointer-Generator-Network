Liverpool suffered another blow as winger Lazar Markovic was forced off with an injury in Serbia's Euro 2016 qualifier with Armenia. 

The 20-year-old limped off after just 25 minutes with a suspected muscle tear which could rule him out of action for up to a month. 

It will heighten Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' concern about his players heading off on international duty.

The 20-year-old has experienced a difficult start to his Liverpool career and is set for a spell on the sidelines 

Defender Dejan Lovren picked up an abdominal injury in Croatia training and Daniel Sturridge suffered a thigh strain in an England session last month.  

On the pitch a last-minute equaliser from former Manchester United winger Zoran Tosic salvaged a 1-1 draw for Serbia in Yerevan.

Robert Arzumanyan had put the hosts ahead with 17 minutes remaining as Armenia looked set for their first ever win over Serbia in Group I. 

Marcos Pizzelli squandered the opportunity to clinch the points when Vladimir Stojkovic saved his 83rd-minute penalty. 

And Tosic made him pay when he converted a pass from Southampton playmaker Dusan Tadic. 

Armenia play Euro 2016 hosts France in a friendly on Tuesday while Serbia take on Albania.
