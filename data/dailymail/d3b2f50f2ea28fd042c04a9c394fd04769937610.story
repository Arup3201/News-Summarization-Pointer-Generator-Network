These are the first stunning pictures of comet PanSTARRS as it became visible above the UK for the first time last night.

Paul Kingston managed to capture comet C/2011 L4 PanSTARRS in almost clear skies above the Irish Sea as it graced the western horizon trailing a blaze of fire.

The pictures were taken over from near Whitehaven, Cumbria, and at St Bridget's Church in the nearby seaside village of Lowca.

It's here! Comet C/2011 L4 PanSTARRS is seen in almost clear skies over the coast of Cumbria last night

PanSTARRS is pictured in the sky above St Bridget's Church, Lowca, Cumbria: Photographer Paul Kingston said he has been looking forward to seeing the comet in our skies for months

Mr Kingston, 31, of Teesdale, said: 
'It was an amazing sight to see the comet which I've been looking 
forward to seeing for some months now.

'It's
one of the first glimpses we've had in the UK due to cloud cover but 
there was a fantastic sunset and beautiful clear skies.

'It
was really difficult to spot at first, with it being in the same part 
of the sky as the setting Sun, but once darkness set in, it was there in
all its glory, beneath the crescent moon.

'It's
very difficult to see with the naked eye, but with binoculars or a DSLR
camera you shouldn't have a problem and it's due to be in the western 
skies for the next few weeks.'

PanSTARRS has already been visible to observers in the southern hemisphere for some weeks, but appeared in northern skies for the first time in the past few days.

Yesterday MailOnline published pictures of the comet blazing a trail through the skies over Las Vegas and southern California and, in coming weeks, observers at ever higher latitudes will have a chance to see it.

Currently a mere 93million miles away, it is now heading away from our solar system and is not expect to return for another 100,000 years.

However, it will be visible in the northern hemisphere for the next few weeks, just after sunset in the west.

To find PanSTARRS in UK skies, stargazers will need a clear sky, ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon, according to the Royal Astronomical Society.

After sunset the comet will appear as a misty patch not far from the crescent Moon, low down in the western sky.

Searching for PanSTARRS through binoculars is recommended, and it will help to see the tails which should be pointing upwards from the horizon.

It will be visible for the next couple of weeks, but as the nights pass the comet will move away from the Sun and fade and light from the Moon will interfere more.

PanSTARRS' name is an acronym for the 
Hawaiian telescope used to spot it two years ago - the Panoramic Survey 
Telescope and Rapid Response System.

The
volcano-top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and 
comets that might be headed our way. - and in recent months there have 
been several.

Like other 
comets of its type, PanSTARRS is thought to have originated in the Oort 
Cloud, a vast region containing millions of comets located more than two
light years from the Sun.

PanSTARRS
travelled in towards the inner Solar system for millions of years, 
dormant for most of this time as a small nucleus made up of rock and 
ices.

When comets approach 
the Sun, these ices heat up, eventually turning to gases that jet out 
into space together with dusty material to form a head or coma around 
the cometary nucleus.

Particles
from the Sun (the so-called solar wind) blow the gases back in a 
straight tail, whilst sunlight exerts a pressure on the dust particles 
to create a curved tail.

'After sunset the comet will be low 
down in the west and appear as a misty patch not far from the crescent 
Moon,' an RAS spokesman said.

'Using binoculars will make it easier to find and will certainly help identify the tails which should point up from the horizon.

'As the days pass, the comet will move away from the Sun and fade and light from the Moon will interfere more.

'At the same time however, PANSTARRS will be higher up, will be visible later in the night and so be seen in a darker sky.

'After
its brief period of visibility, the comet will travel back out towards 
the depths of space where it will be only be detected by large 
telescopes.'

Comet PanSTARRS is the first of two comets which will appear in the night sky this year in the UK.

Later this year, in November and December, Comet ISON is expected to be one of the brightest comets ever seen and experts believe it will be brighter than the moon in the night sky.

And next year astronomers are anticipating potential cosmic fireworks after they identified a comet hurtling into our solar system that could hit Mars with potentially catastrophic force.

According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet.

But the unpredictable nature of comet orbits, which can change as jet-like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the Sun, means it could pass further away, or veer into a direct collision course.
