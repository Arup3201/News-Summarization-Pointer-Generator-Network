Cristiano Ronaldo has taken a dig at Atletico Madrid - labelling them as 'defensive' following Real Madrid's 4-2 aggregate loss to their rivals in the quarter-final of the Copa del Rey.

The 29-year-old picked up his third Ballon d'Or on Monday but then saw his side eliminated from the cup by their Madrid rivals during the week.

Fernando Torres netted twice during the 2-2 second-leg draw - with Ronaldo himself getting on the scoresheet - as the cup holders were knocked out at the last-eight stage.

But Ronaldo told AS: 'Atleti don’t play attractive football. They are very defensive. They wait for dead-balls, but it works well for them. Their coach and players should be respected. ...

'Atleti are a consistent team who have spent a long time together. Valencia are getting better and are a rival to watch out for.

'And then there are Madrid and Barcelona who are candidates for everything. This is good for La Liga.'

Ronaldo and his team-mate trained at Valdebebas on Saturday and looked in good spirits. 

Manager Carlo Ancelotti says his side will not be lapse in defence when they look to preserve top spot in La Liga on Sunday.

Los Blancos head to mid-table Getafe in Sunday's morning kick-off on the back of losing their Copa del Rey crown.

Real have found the going tough since the winter break and have seen their lead at the top of La Liga reduced to a point, but Ancelotti is confident they will be up to speed this weekend.

'We would be concerned if we did not have chances to score, but (against Atletico) we produced attractive play with quality, tempo and intensity,' the Italian told his club's official website.

'I'm not concerned about that, we scored two goals. The concern comes from the mistakes we made at the back in bringing the ball out, which I don't think we will make again.'

And rather than dwell too much on the loss, Ancelotti is looking to take lessons from it in order to help Real's chances for the rest of the season.

'You have to assess the match; we were made to pay a heavy price for our mistakes,' he said.

'But for the first 60 minutes we played very well. You can't play better. We now have three weeks to prepare for the Champions League and this is good for the team.'

Defeat was a bitter pill to swallow for Ronaldo.

The division's 26-goal leading scorer is of the same mindset as his coach, though.

'I apologise on behalf of the team, perhaps we could have done things better,' he said. 'However, we can also say that we have La Liga, the Champions League and lots of other things to win this year.

'Obviously it's never good to lose, however you have to think positively. The team will play at a higher level later in the season. We aim to win La Liga and the Champions League.'

In Getafe Real will meet an opponent woefully out of form in the league but flying high in the Copa del Rey.

Their last La Liga success came back on October 31 - a 2-1 win at Deportivo - but since then they have been winless in nine, with their three victories coming in the cup.

A 1-0 success over Almeria on Wednesday booked them their place in a quarter-final with Villarreal.
