If anyone doubted Cara Delevingne's catwalk supremacy then this year's Fashion Weeks will have surely convinced them.

The 21-year-old model has graced a host of top designers' catwalk shows across the four fashion weeks, including Chanel, Valentino, Stella McCartney.

And now, as if more proof were needed that the English model is every designer's pet, she has been spotted heading out in hot-off-the-catwalk outfits, something even the top supermodels don't manage to wangle.

Cara wore the suit out (right) just two days after it was shown at the Spring/Summer 2014 Saint Laurent show in Paris on Monday (left)

Cara was seen at the Mademoiselle C premiere in Paris alongside friend Rita Ora in a sleek black bodysuit, slashed the navel, which had only just been seen on the Saint Laurent catwalk.

The party, which followed a showing of a movie about former French Vogue editor, Carine Roitfeld, was attended by a host of A-list stars and fashion royalty.

On Monday the quirky model left Stella McCartney's Paris Fashion Week show wearing the trouser suit she had modelled on the catwalk just minutes before.

The gold suit may have been dressed down by Cara with trainers and a beanie hat, but it was unmistakably the same outfit she had just showcased in front of hundreds in the show.

During Milan Fashion Week Cara was also seen heading into the party thrown to celebrate the opening of Stuart Weizmann's new flagship boutique in a Fendi dress which her friend Georgia May Jagger wore during the Fendi show earlier in the day.

Cara managed to nab the Fendi dress Georgia May Jagger had worn on the runway just hours before and wore it to a party that evening, pairing it with a red jacket and shoes and a yellow bag

Cara shared the catwalk with other supermodels including Miranda Kerr, 30, to show Stella McCartney’s racy lace, luxe sportswear and some seriously sexy masculine tailoring.

At the Chanel show her usual honey-blonde locks were replaced with a fierce platinum bob for the iconic fashion label's spring/summer '14 Paris Fashion Week presentation at the city's Grand Palais on Tuesday morning.

She was then seen after the show seemingly leaving the building in the dress she had worn on the catwalk, carrying her classic black court shoes and still in her full stage make-up and wig.

However, few models, no matter how famous, are given the new seasons clothes to keep, as there is generally only one or two versions of each outfit made for the catwalk.

Cara’s staggering popularity, and the certainty of her being photographed wherever she goes means that even top designers are willing to bend the rules for her.
