A wave of sheep mutilations in Port Lavaca, TX over the past
few months lead some residents and UFO groups to believe the killers may be
from another planet.

Wayne and Karen Daggs lost 21 of their Barbados Sheep since July
and lost their last two less than a week ago. At first Daggs thought that
people were stealing the sheep for food, but the surgical precision and the graphic
nature of the mutilations led him to believe otherwise.

The mutilations piqued the curiosity of Charles Stansburge,
a popular member of the Mutual UFO Network, after he’d read an article about the
killings in an Advocate article published in the Houston Chronicle.

Stansburge, the organization’s section director, traveled
from Rosenberg to Daggs' residence to launch an investigation on Tuesday. He
plans to help the Calhoun County Sheriff’s department solve the puzzle.

Fletcher Grey, a senior field investigator of the Mutual UFO
Network planned to arrive on Wednesday to help Stansburge with the
investigation.

Police investigators believe the incidents may be related to
satanic worship. ‘I can't think of a reason aside from rituals or malicious
mischievousness for the mutilations,’ Calhoun County investigator Bobbie
Vickery told the Victoria Advocate.

Recently, Daggs has been losing an animal every five days
and usually a few at a time.  ‘At first I
lost four little ones,’ said Daggs.

A little over a week ago a male sheep was found by the pond
castrated. His cause of death is unknown.

After three female sheep went missing, Daggs found two of
them. ‘One of them was found in the pond, stabbed behind the ear. Another had
had its female sexual organs removed.’ The organs sat next to the dead sheep.

The removal of the organs looked very surgical to Daggs and
it was curious to him as to why no trace of evidence was found next to any of
the sheep. ‘It doesn't look like a coyote got at them,’ he says. ‘I think that
a person is doing this.’

Also, as to how someone stole the sheep from the property
was perplexing. Barbados sheep weigh 60 to 75 pounds, not an easy weight to stealthily
carry off property, Daggs says.

‘It's not just kids. Whoever is doing this knows what they
are doing,’ Daggs continued.

laser-like incisions, no traces of blood, and absence of tracks are characteristics of
the mutilations that Stansburge has investigated.

Stansburge has not
commented on what he believes is killing and stealing the sheep. His findings
are confidential.

‘It's an ongoing
investigation so I can't talk too much about it,’ said Stansburge. ‘We need to
find out what is getting in the property.’

‘It could be a man, a wolf, an E.T. or anything,’ he continued.
‘We're trying to lean towards earthly things.’

In the early 1900s a similar mutilation was discovered. A
horse was found dead with no traces of blood and nothing but the bone above the
neck, Stansburge said.

An examination of the horse showed that its nervous system
had been removed with what looked like a laser.

A bag with unknown metal tools that could have been a ‘laser
gun’ was found 50 feet away from the horse.

According to Stransburge, Alien races have inhabited or
visited the Earth for hundreds of thousands of years.

Calhoun County Sherriff George Aleman believes a human is
behind the killings. ‘It wasn't a wild animal, which would tear the meat,’
Aleman says. ‘This was too clean to be an animal. Whoever did this knew what
they were doing.’

Wayne Daggs worked in law enforcement for 23 years,18
of those years as a constable with Calhoun County Precicnt 4. Since retiring,
he has tended to his animals.

He is starting to believe he may have offended someone and that
someone is seeking revenge by stealing his animals. ‘I worked hard to not make enemies
while I was on the job,’ Daggs said.

He had an emotional connection to the animals and deeply
mourns their loss. ‘It hurts me severely,’ he said.

Daggs puts the cost of the animals he has lost at around
$1,250, and the investigation is being treated by the county as a case of theft
of livestock and mutilation.

Aleman mentioned that there was a group of self-proclaimed
satanic worshipers in the area in the late 70’s who were responsible for
cattle mutilations.

However, Aleman doesn’t think that group is linked to these killings.
‘This could be someone who has nothing else to do but hurt animals for kicks,’
he says.

The Calhoun County Sheriff's Department is offering $2,500
for information regarding the sheep mutilations. They are asking that anyone in
the area who has had animals go missing or killed should contact law enforcement officials as soon
as possible.
