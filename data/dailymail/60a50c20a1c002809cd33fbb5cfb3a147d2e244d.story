It sounds like a textbook millionaire's bolthole - four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a mooring on the River Thames.

But this £1.8million manor comes with something even the most imaginative buyer could only dream of - a prison made of stones from London Bridge.

Former BBC journalist Lynn Lewis bought the long-forgotten fragment when he and his wife Valerie built their mock-Georgian Tower House in Shepperton, Surrey, from scratch in 2002.

Millionaire's bolthole: The mock Georgian Tower House in Shepperton, Surrey, was built from scratch in 2002 by former BBC journalist Lynn Lewis and his wife Valerie. It has a garden feature for the man who has everything - an imitation prison made from the original stones which were used to build the 19th Century London Bridge

Another brick in the wall: The stones at the bottom of the garden look innocuous - but they are from the 19th Century London Bridge and comprise a mock prison

No bridge needed: If the owner can make it beyond the bridge-jail, lying in wait is a private mooring on the River Thames with enough room for two boats

Mr Lewis was fascinated by the history of the site, which had formerly housed a sprawling manor which came with its own title.

The Lord of the Manor had to provide a jail so Mr Lewis did just that, building it out of the stone fragments which had been removed from the Victorian bridge when it was widened more than 100 years ago.

The 19th Century London Bridge was designed by John Rennie and opened in 1831, replacing its 600-year-old Medieval predecessor which had become crammed with traffic.

It was the latest in a long history of Thames crossings dating back to Roman times but had to be expanded in 1896, to accommodate the heaving crowds for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria the next year.

It is then that it is thought the stone fragment was removed and taken to a field near what is now Heathrow Airport, where it lay forgotten for several decades until it was reportedly rediscovered by the engineer and inventor Sir Barnes Wallis.

Throne: Sitting on the site of a former estate, the mock Georgian home brings with it the rather grandiose title of Lord of the Manor and the need to have a private jail

The Victorian London Bridge was eventually dismantled in 1967 and reassembled stone-by-stone in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, after the oil tycoon Robert P McCulloch bought the remains for $2.46million.

But the millionaire had little idea that a piece of his bridge, which still stands today, had been left behind.

Now 77, Mr Lewis and his wife spent many years running a floating antiques shop on their barge on the River Thames before finally deciding to sell Tower House this year.

The mock Georgian property is on the market for £1.8million and is set in around three acres with its own 130ft-long private mooring on the Thames with room for two boats.

Tim Firth, sales director at Jackson-Stops & Staff, said: 'It is not a large house, but it is lovely property. It would suit a couple and there is a mooring'

Old and new: Although the house features the remains of London Bridge, most of it is considerably more modern with a number of outbuildings

Large: It also has two reception rooms, one of which has a bay window and double doors looking out on the Thames, along with a conservatory and several outbuildings

It also has two reception rooms, one of which has a bay window and double doors looking out on the Thames, along with a conservatory and several outbuildings, including a stable.

Tim Firth, sales director at the Shepperton office of Jackson-Stops & Staff, said: 'The home was on the land of a large manor home which was split up. Whoever buys it gets the title of Lord of the Manor.

'One of the historic jobs for the Lord of the Manor was to provide a jail. So the developer built a mock jail in the garden using parts of the old London bridge.

'It is not a large house, but it is lovely property. It would suit a couple and there is a mooring so it is ideal for a boat person.'

Unlikely attraction: The bridge took three years to ship to the U.S. and reassemble along with a traditional 'English' village, with open-air shops and a hedge maze

It was an unlikely fate for a piece of British engineering - dismantled stone by 19th Century stone and painstakingly reassembled across a lake in the middle of the Arizona desert.

But that is exactly what the tycoon Robert P McCulloch did in 1968 when he bought the bridge for $2.46million, around £10.2million in today's money, in an enthusiastic bid to turn the barren Lake Havasu into a tourist attraction.

Popular legend tells that McCulloch thought he was buying the far more famous Tower Bridge, but the rumour was always furiously denied.

Argument aside, his wacky idea was generally seen as a success. The bridge took three years to ship to the U.S. and reassemble, and with it he built a traditional 'English' village which featured open-air shops and a hedge maze.

The bridge still stands today, and the area around it has seen hefty modern redevelopment.
