They ran against Barack Obama and Joe Biden in 2012 - and lost - but yesterday Congressman Paul Ryan said he would love to see Mitt Romney have another run at the White House saying the 'third time's the charm'.

Former Massachusetts Governor Romney who failed to win the nomination in 2008 and then lost the election to President Barack Obama four years later interviewed Mr Ryan at the Union League Club of Chicago about his new book The Way Forward: Renewing the American Idea - the first time the pair have been seen at a public event since the failed presidential bid two years ago.

Governor Romney returned the compliment claiming that Congressman Ryan 'wouldn't be a bad president' himself.

Congressman Ryan has said that he will wait until after the midterm elections to decide whether to pursue his own presidential campaign in 2016.

The Republicans need six seats to take control of the Senate, which would in turn give them Congress thus making life difficult for President Obama in his last two years in office.

Yesterday's men or tomorrow's presidential running mates? Congressman Ryan expounds his philosophy while former Massachusetts Governor Romney listens

Governor Romney has been campaigning for GOP candidates across the country, most recently for Congressman Tom Cotton this week in Arkansas, and Congressman Ryan has been promoting his book. Romney himself reviewed Ryan's manuscript and offered notes. And Congressman Ryan even sought advice from former Romney speech writers and advisers during the writing.

During their interview, both men criticised the president's record on domestic issues, including the economy, health care and immigration, with Congressman Ryan warning that President Obama will 'poison the well' on immigration compromise if he takes any unilateral action.

Governor Romney said that the president sent a message to Russia when he did not act in Syria and that there has been 'an explosion of very bad things in the world' since then.

They also blamed President Obama and the Democratic-led Senate for not working with Republicans on important issues.

'If people want to actually see action in this country and dealing with problems from education to health care, immigration to our fiscal needs ... they're going to have to vote for Republican senators and ... a Republican president, as well,' Governor Romney said.

Congressman Ryan told reporters after the question-and-answer session with his former running mate that he would 'love to see Mitt Romney run for president again'.

The Q&A session stayed on political issues and did not touch on the section where Mr Ryan recounts how at the age of 15, he discovered his 55-year-old alcoholic father dying in bed from an apparent heart attack.

Mr Ryan has said event shaped him as a politician and family man, and figures heavily into whether he'll seek the presidency in 2016.

Although writing a book often is seen as a prelude to a presidential campaign, Congressman Ryan has said he's not sure that he is ready to spend more time away from Janesville, the small Wisconsin town where he grew up and where he and his wife, Janna, have raised their three children.

'One of the reasons why I've always passed elected leadership positions up in the House - you know, speaker, leader, all the things people ask you to run for - is because it takes you away from your family even more,' Mr Ryan said. 'I've made career decisions based upon family balance and part of that is because of my own upbringing and my own childhood.' 

Who will run in 2016? Will Congressman Ryan or Governor Romney face Hillary Clinton or another Democratic candidate in two years' time?
