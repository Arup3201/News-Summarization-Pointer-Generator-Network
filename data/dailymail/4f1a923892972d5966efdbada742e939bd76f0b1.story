Satisfaction in being British has fallen to an all-time low with only one-third of people saying they are ‘very proud’ of their national identity.

A new study has found just 35 per cent are ‘very proud’ to be British, compared with 43 per cent a decade ago. Nearly half said they were ‘somewhat proud’.

Opposition to the Iraq war and the fallout from the economic crisis are among the chief factors national pride has dwindled since 2003.

Despite events such as the Royal wedding and the Olympics, just a third of people are 'very proud' to be British

Penny Young, of NatCen Social Research, which carried out the annual British Social Attitudes survey, said the drop of 8 percentage points was a ‘marked fall’.

She said: ‘There was a lot of confidence in Britain in 2003 but now we are still recovering from the financial crash.

Researchers say people were more positive about Britain in 2003 before the country slumped into a recession

‘But for some people, greater exposure to other countries through budget travel and a wider digital community can lead them to query what it means to be British.

‘The big unknown is whether today’s young people will grow more proud of their British heritage.

‘Even if pride increases with age, there is a lot of ground to make up and as a result we would envisage a continued decline.’

The survey, carried out last year and to be published within months,found only 20 per cent of young people aged between 18 and 24 are ‘very proud’ to be British, compared with a third in 2003.

The figure increases for older age groups and peaks at 63 per cent for over-65s.

Women are marginally less proud than men but there were significant differences depending on the education and social class of the respondent.

A fifth of those with degrees said they were very proud to be British, compared with 59 per cent of those who have no qualifications.

And the study discovered that a third of those in the top three social classes - professional, managerial and skilled non-manual - were very proud. compared to more than 50 per cent in the bottom three - skilled manual, partly skilled and unskilled occupations.

Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future think-tank, said: ‘For the more educated and affluent there is a cultural aversion to strong patriotism - they are more cosmopolitan.

‘There is a massive age gap in things like support for UKIP so young people might feel that being very proud is something associated with extremist groups.’

The deeply unpopular Iraq war also sapped confidence in the nation, especially among young people

He said there was evidence of a shift towards Britishness becoming a secondary identity.

‘Britishness is still there in the background and we will come together for events such as the jubilee or the First

World War centenary but the other nationalities are gaining ground.’ Despite the decline, more people were very proud of Britain’s achievements in the arts, literature, science and technology, where the nation has consistently punched above its weight in the world.

More than half of people said they were very proud of the Armed Forces and the UK’s history and pride in Britain’s sporting achievements has doubled in the past decade, boosted by the London Olympics in 2012 and a slew of gold medals.

A separate poll for the Sunday Times found that the Queen was the person who best represented Britain. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry also appear in the top five.

Hugo Vickers, a royal biographer, said: ‘The monarchy and the Queen remain the cornerstone of British society. She represents many of the qualities considered typical of British identity.’
