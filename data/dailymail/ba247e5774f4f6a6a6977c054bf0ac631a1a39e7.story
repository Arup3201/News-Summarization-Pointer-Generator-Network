Misdiagnosed: Pat Crowe was thought to have asthma - the condition he was actually suffering from (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) wasn't discovered for 11 years

Struggling to climb stairs without becoming breathless, Pat Crowe couldn't fathom how much his health had deteriorated since being diagnosed with asthma a decade earlier.

Despite previously enjoying an active social life, playing darts and supporting local cricket and football teams, now the slightest exertion left him gasping for breath, coughing, wheezing and lethargic.

'At 39, I was astonished when my GP told me I had asthma, but apparently you can develop it as an adult,' says Pat, who lives with his wife, Lyn, in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire.

After his diagnosis in 1989 he was given a ventolin inhaler - or reliever - to ease his symptoms, which quickly relaxes the lung's airways that can become inflamed and narrow in an asthma patient.

This can be caused by an allergic trigger such as pollen or dust, or a non-allergic one such as exercise or cold weather. This causes symptoms such as breathing difficulties, coughing, wheeziness and tightness in the chest.

But Pat found that the inhalers did not help enough, and after his diagnosis he frequently experienced attacks lasting for weeks, only clearing up with antibiotics.

As the years went by he needed his ventolin up to nine times a day, causing heart palpitations, a common side-effect from over-use. He was given a different type of inhaler, but still needed this constantly, as well as using a steroid inhaler - or preventer - morning and night.

'Over the next few years my need for the inhaler grew,' says grandad and father-of-two Pat, 62, a former coal miner. Being so breathless meant his confidence plummeted, making him almost housebound.

'I panicked about going outside and crossing busy roads because I was having trouble breathing and couldn't move quickly.'

During bad spells he was also prescribed stronger steroid pills, which caused side-effects, including a swollen face and hunger.

Widespread: The condition affects 900,000 people in the UK and is incurable, with an estimated 30,000 people dieing from it each year

'My wife became my carer, and my family were very scared watching me struggle to breathe,' he says. 'I didn't even want to get out of bed and go down stairs because I was worried about getting back up. My life changed completely.'

It was only then that Pat's consultant measured how well his lungs were functioning with a spirometer (patients blow into the machine and it assesses the volume of air inhaled and exhaled).

Patients with asthma will have normal lung function, unless they are experiencing symptoms or having an attack. Pat's poor results suggested, 11 years after his asthma diagnosis, that he didn't have asthma after all, which explained why he'd found the condition impossible to control.

His consultant realised he actually had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an umbrella term for a collection of conditions causing lung damage, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema (in which the tiny air sacs, or alveoli, in the lungs are damaged).

The condition is incurable and affects 900,000 people in the UK, usually above the age of 35, and an estimated 30,000 people die from it each year. Experts believe there are also more than two million undiagnosed cases.

The condition is linked to smoking but it can also develop after long-term asthma.

'We're now finding childhood asthma is a risk factor for COPD, probably because it strikes during an important stage of development, so by the end of their teens asthmatics often don't have as good a lung function as they should, and when lung function starts declining this can happen to them more quickly,' says Dr Ramesh Kurukulaaratchy, a consultant respiratory physician from Southampton General Hospital.

But because symptoms of COPD and asthma are so similar, they are commonly confused by health professionals, he adds.

After Pat was diagnosed with COPD, his medication was changed to a drug called Sprivia, which relaxes the airways for 24 hours with a single dose - working for longer than asthma medication.

'It doesn't work for everyone, but for me it's been the best thing since sliced bread,' he says. 'It's given me back my mobility and confidence, and I rarely need my inhaler.'

Big improvement: Since treating his condition properly, Pat has regained his confidence and is comfortable getting around

Specialist advice is crucial when it comes to achieving an accurate diagnosis says Dr Kurukulaaratchy: 'GPs need better awareness of these conditions. They both rank highly in hospital admissions, but if management is right early on, you can improve quality of life and possibly even life expectancy.'

Nick Hopkinson, honorary chest physician at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, adds: 'Asthma patients usually have normal lung function, but when they experience asthma symptoms or an attack their airways go into spasm, becoming narrow and inflamed.

'Then, after taking medication - usually a ventolin inhaler - their lungs return to normal.

'However, COPD patients have relatively fixed lung disease, so even on a good day they still have symptoms. Most of the damage isn't reversible (the airways do not widen and return to normal) and progressively worsens.'

One major consequence of misdiagnosis is that patients could be given the wrong medication.

COPD patients usually start with bronchodilator inhalers to relieve narrowing of the airways and then go through a hierarchy of drugs, starting with shorter-acting medications and moving to longer-acting ones, as the disease worsens, says Dr Kurukulaaratchy.

'Research has shown steroids can lead to an increased risk of pneumonia (inflammation of lung tissue) in COPD patients, so this is a risk if they are wrongly labelled as having asthma.'

If the condition doesn't improve, they can end up using a lot of steroids, which have side-effects such as weight gain, mood changes and osteoporosis (weak bones.) But for asthma patients inhaled steroids are prescribed early to reduce inflammation in the airways. 

'If patients are told they have COPD but it's asthma and they don't have inhaled steroids, they won't be able to control the disease - leaving them prone to worsening symptoms and even death from an asthma attack,' says Dr Hopkinson. 'We see 1,100 asthma deaths a year in the UK, often because they weren't on preventer treatments.'

COPD sufferers should attend pulmonary rehabilitation courses, where they learn about the condition and receive individual exercise programmes - such as gentle walking and moving weights with their legs - which boosts their fitness and confidence, so without it they'd miss out, says Dr Hopkinson.

For most asthma patients, using inhalers, not smoking and avoiding triggers means they can live a normal life, he says, so if someone's 'asthma' is uncontrollable, one reason could be because it's COPD. 

'Doing allergy tests - because asthma patients often have allergies - could be beneficial, adds Dr Kurukulaaratchy, saying that advanced tests such as CT scanning can help by showing the lung damage associated with COPD, which can make diagnosis easier.

'If I'd had the right treatment and gone on a pulmonary rehabilitation course earlier I wouldn't have suffered during the years I went downhill, but I've never been angry about my misdiagnosis,' says Pat.

'I'm now involved with my CCG [clinical commissioning group], sharing my experiences to ensure people with COPD receive the right help and to prevent this happening to someone else.'For more information, contact the British Lung Foundation at blf.org.uk.
