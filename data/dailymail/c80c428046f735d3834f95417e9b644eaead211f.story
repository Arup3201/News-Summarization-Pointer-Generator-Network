World stock markets began to shake today in response to a U.S. government shutdown that shows no signs of ending soon - and could pave the way for a much more devastating default.

Investors have generally taken the view that the first such shutdown in 17 years would prove temporary, but there are growing worries about its implications for talks on raising the U.S. public debt ceiling later this month.

While the shutdown would have to drag on to have a substantial effect on the United States economy, a failure to raise the debt ceiling carries the threat of a government default on its debt with wide and unpredictable consequences.

America has a legal limit on its borrowing of $16.7trillion dollars, which is predicted to reach that level on October 17.

But with Congress failing to agree a budget, there are fears it may also fail to agree an increase on its debt limit by the deadline.

Iwan Morgan, a Professor of U.S. Studies and Commonwealth Fund Professor of American History at University College London, told CNN: 'All this may look like a local infighting, but the possible consequences could be global in scope if the stand-off continues until mid-October, when the U.S. is scheduled to raise its debt limit.

'Instability in the world money markets is the last thing that the likes of Greece, Ireland, Spain and even France need.

'If
 the U.S. imbroglio results in a debt default next month, it will serve 
as a very bad example to eurozone countries undergoing austerity to 
remedy their indebtedness.'

He said one political ramifications could 
be the rise of nationalist and populist parties who may use America's 
troubles to legitimise calls for defaults on their country's public 
debts.

Economics commentator Jeremy Warner, the assistant editor of the Daily Telegraph, said the consequences of a default would be cataclysmic.

He
 said: 'Given the key position occupied by U.S. Treasuries in the 
world's money system, the effect of such a default would be like a death
 star exploding.

'It 
would be Lehman Brothers to the power of a thousand. Indeed, the effect 
would be so calamitous that nobody can quite believe it will ever be 
allowed to happen.'

A recent poll of a majority of 
economists, however, found they believe is a less than
 10 per cent chance that Washington's budget feud will lead to the United
 States defaulting on any of its debt.

The funding cut-off for much of the government began yesterday as a Republican effort to kill or delay the nation's health care law stalled action on a short-term, traditionally routine spending bill.

Republicans pivoted to a strategy to try to reopen the government piecemeal but were unable to immediately advance the idea in the House of Representatives.

National parks like Yellowstone and Alcatraz Island were shuttered, government websites went dark and hundreds of thousands of nonessential workers reported for a half-day to fill out time cards, hand in their government cellphones and laptops, and change voicemail messages to gird for a deepening shutdown.

About 800,000 employees - about a third of the federal workforce - are being forced off the job in the first government shutdown in 17 years, suspending most nonessential federal programs and services.

People classified as essential employees - such as air traffic controllers, Border Patrol agents and most food inspectors - will continue to work.

'We do fear that as this discussion drags on, volatility in the market will continue to increase,' said Patrick Moonen, senior equity strategist at ING Investment Management.

The dollar had already suffered on Tuesday as the shutdown began and it fell another 0.6 percent against the yen, seen as a safe haven by investors in times of political strife, to 97.36 yen - its lowest since late August.

The euro also drew support from events in Washington but is hampered by an economic outlook that may yet provoke more action - or at least the threat of action - from the European Central Bank, meeting on Wednesday in Paris.

The latest round of political turmoil in Italy has not helped the region's prospects - although there are signs that Prime Minister Enrico Letta may be on the verge of assembling enough support to keep his government in power and fend off elections for now.

By 0900 GMT, the euro was up about 0.1 percent at $1.3554, nearing an eight-month high touched a day earlier.

Global equities, as measured by MSCI's world equity index , were down 0.3 percent after starting the new quarter with a 0.9 percent gain on Tuesday.

U.S. stock futures eased 0.2 per cent signaling further weakness ahead while Europe's FTSE 300 index shed 0.75 percent and Asian shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent.

'With the U.S. shutdown, everyone is hoping for the best,' said Luca Jellinek, head of European interest rates strategy at Credit Agricole CIB. 'But none of us are political analysts, so the market has suspended judgment until we see what happens.'
