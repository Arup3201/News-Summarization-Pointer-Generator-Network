A report detailing allegations of instances of rape and sexual assault inside Australia's Nauru detention centre has been labelled as 'very concerning' by Finance Minister Mathias Cormann.

The 86-page review, released on Friday, included allegations of indecent and physical assault, as well as sexual harassment, at the offshore processing centre.

'The department has accepted all of the recommendations and all of the recommendations will be implemented,' Mr Cormann told Sky News on Saturday.

However, Labor have criticised the Federal Government over its initial response to the report after Tony Abbott said these institutions 'aren't perfect.'

A review into sexual abuse inside Australia's Nauru detention centre (pictured) has found evidence of rape, sexual assault and guards trading marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees

The ABC  reported that when Mr Abbott was first asked about his response to the report he appeared to dismiss its findings by responding 'occasionally, I dare say, things happen.'

Labor's Immigration spokesperson Richard Marles called the Federal Government's response a 'disgrace' and believes Mr Abbott needs to take responsibility for the situation. 

'The Moss review finds that the testimony of asylum seekers is convincing and it concludes that the degree of sexual assault within these detention facilities is being under-reported,' Mr Marles said in Melbourne.

'This is quite evidently shocking.' 

Prime Minister Abbott later said that the Government would adopt the 19 recommendations outlined in the review and called the findings 'very disturbing.'

The independent review by former integrity commissioner Philip Moss was released on Friday and has uncovered several dozen cases with guards possibly trading drugs for 'sexual favours' on the Pacific island nation

Work has already begun on implementing the recommendations in cooperation with the Nauru government, service providers and the Australian Federal Police.

The report also allegedly found evidence that guards traded marijuana for sexual favours from female detainees.

The independent review was ordered by former immigration minister, Scott Morrison following earlier claims that children had been abused while in detention.

Detainees had previously complained that two-minute showers were not long enough and had requested four minute showers instead. 

However when one woman asked if she could turn the water back on to wash shampoo out of her eyes, it's alleged in the review that a male guard said he would give her more time, if she showed him her naked body. 

The review also alleged that there have been two specific instances of rape at the centre

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the content of a review into allegations of abuse against asylum seekers on Nauru is 'very concerning

Mr Cormann would not be drawn on whether more media access should be allowed on the island in the wake of the report, but said he was concerned by its findings

One rape happened in a woman's tent, it's alleged. The woman subsequently asked for the incident to be kept quiet for fear of retaliation from other detainees.  She then changed her mind and asked for police to investigate, according to the report.

The Nauruan Government then granted refugee status to the alleged perpetrator and he is now settled in the Nuaruan community, the report stated.

The second female detainee reported that she had been raped by a 'contract service provider staff member', according to the report. She also did not report the incident due to cultural and religious reasons. 

In another instance, a female detainee told the review that a guard had allegedly offered to give her friend chewing gum and a lollipop if she allowed him to see her naked. 

On another occasion two female detainees recounted a time when a driver and his assistant turned the vehicle's headlights off and propositioned the women with an offer of cigarettes and chewing gum.

One transferee told the review that women in the camp could offer sexual favours in return for marijuana.

'Because they (the transferees) are suffering great depression here, and they feel relieved when they smoke the marijuana, the officers have made them addicted for their own reasons,' the detainee said. 

'Because the women do not get paid here, so what they need to obtain,they only have to offer sexual - fulfil the requests of the men.'
