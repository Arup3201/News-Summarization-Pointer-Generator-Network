Chelsea fans wanting Romelu Lukaku or Thibaut Courtois on their new shirts will be left disappointed - as the club shop will not print their names.

The Belgian duo have yet to meet up with Jose Mourinho’s side for pre-season after the World Cup, and have such not been allocated squad numbers.

Courtois has returned from a long-term loan at Atletico Madrid to finally pull on Chelsea colours this season.

Safe hands: Thibaut Courtois (left) is expected to challenge Petr Cech for the No 1 spot at Stamford Bridge

He faces a head-to-head battle with Blues stalwart Petr Cech for the No 1 shirt.

Lukaku, meanwhile, has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge despite impressing up front on loan for Everton during the last campaign.

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez remains confident his side can entice the target man to Goodison Park on a permanent basis.

Asked by fans in Thailand whether Lukaku would be joining the club again, the former Wigan boss even went as far as to say: ‘Of course we’ll get him’.

Everton face competition from Wolfsburg for the 21-year-old, but Martinez and club officials are confident that the in-demand forward sees his future in the Premier League with their side.
