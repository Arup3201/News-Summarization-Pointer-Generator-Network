A surveillance camera  has recorded the horrifying moment that a man was shot dead at point-blank range while he cradled his three-year-old goddaughter in his arms at a Brazilian bakery.

The video shows a 17-year-old gunman ride up to the bakery on a bicycle and sneak up beside him before training a semi-automatic handgun at his victim's head and firing.

The horrified little girl covers her face and stares at her godfather as the cold-blooded killer unloads two more shots into his body.

Unsuspecting: The gunman can be seen lurking in the background as Thiago André Santos Souza arrives at a bakery outside the Brazilian capital with her goddaughter in his arms

The little girl, mercifully, was unharmed.

Brazilian R7 news reports that the victim was 26-year-old Thiago André Santos Souza. 

No reason was given for his cold-blooded murder, which occurred on Saturday in Brazil's Sobradinho region - about 15 miles outside the capital of Brasilia.

Police arrested a 17-year-old later in the day. He is charged with murder.

Thiago Souza was arriving at the bakery with his fiancee and his young goddaughter when he was killed.

It appears that no one at the bakery realized the murderer was there until he killed Thiago Souza. 

The surveillance video shows him pulling a pistol out of his waistband. He hides it behind his back as he walks up to the victim.

After firing the shots, he flees on the bicycle he arrived with.
