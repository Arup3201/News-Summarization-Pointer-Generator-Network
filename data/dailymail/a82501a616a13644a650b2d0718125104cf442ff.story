Former disgraced New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was spotted over the weekend attending the Dartmouth reunion of his younger girlfriend Lis Smith.

Smith, who is 31, graduated from the Ivy League school in 2005.

According to Page Six, Spitzer, who graduated from Princeton in 1981, was apparently seen circulating at a frat party on Friday night too.

The former New York Governor was forced to resign from his post in 2008 after spending more than $15,000 on prostitutes. He has also recently finalized a very public and bitter divorce from Silda Wall Spitzer.

The once-covert couple have now clearly let go of any attempts to keep their private lives private.

Spitzer had a failed political 'comeback' campaign to become New York City's new comptroller last year, masterminded by Smith.

She then joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary.

Just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed the former governor, who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes, sneaking in and out of Smith's Soho apartment in December.

Now after spending the past few months under the radar, Smith is actively trying to restart her consulting career.

She is now working for the Democratic Governor's Association, paying close attention to Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland who is considered a possible 2016 candidate should Hillary Clinton choose not to run for president.

Spitzer was introduced to his new girlfriend's family over Christmas and the couple took a romantic trip to Jamaica over the New Year - which reportedly included an amorous session inside an outdoor hot-tub.

Spitzer, who was once considered a future presidential candidate, met his wife Silda at Harvard Law School in 1987.

The couple had three daughters as Spitzer rose the ranks from successful lawyer to prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office.

Silda Wall Spitzer recently received a $7.5million payout and to keep her luxury Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan as part of her divorce settlement.

The ex-New York governor's former wife grimly stood by him when his predilection for expensive call girls came to light in 2008. She will also receive $240,000-a-year maintenance for life.

The Spitzers divorce was finalized in February this year and it was agreed that Silda would receive the first $1million within 180 days.

Another $1million will follow on the service of their divorce judgement and then at least $500,000 ever year unless the former politician decides to pay his ex a lump sum.

The annual $240,000 maintenance payment will come to Silda after her former husband has paid the taxes. It will continue until she either remarries or dies.

Spitzer became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers.

His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resigned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have used prostitutes.

Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his wife by his side.

He then attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father

He paid more than $15,000 for services - although this is believed to only be a small fraction of a much bigger total over the years
