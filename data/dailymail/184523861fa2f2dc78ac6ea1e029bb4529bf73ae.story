Vanity Fair and Waitrose columnist Pippa Middleton is generally a fixture at summer's society events but today the brunette skipped the second day of racing at Royal Ascot to run errands on the King's Road in Chelsea.

Wearing a fitted, knee-length dress 29-year-old Pippa pulled up in a smart convertible car as she visited shops in the well-heeled area of south-west London.

The writer finished her summery look with navy suede Jemima Vine pumps and on-trend square-edged sunglasses.

The cerulean-coloured dress, which featured a square neckline, is the latest in a line of block bright outfits that Kate's younger sister has chosen to make sure her style stands out.

On Friday the society beauty wore a mint green knit twinset by 
luxury brand Cashmere By Tania to watch Andy Murray play at Queen's.

She arrived with a male friend to spend a changeable afternoon in 
the west London tennis club, and paid heed to her own recent advice to her Vanity Fair readers on what to take for an afternoon watching the sport.

Last week in her new capacity as society columnist Pippa advised the glossy's readers to bring 'everything from 
sunblock and sunglasses to a 
mackintosh and umbrella' and to wear comfortable shoes.

And as the clouds gathered and the heavens opened over Queen's, her precautions came in very useful: the writer and her mother Carole were spotted huddling under an umbrella before play resumed

The article also saw Pippa describe the 
tournament as 'the highlight of my summer', and recall her first visit 
to the All England Club at the age of eight.

She
 says that she was an aspiring professional tennis player at the time, 
and remembers purchasing a postcard of the women's championship trophy 
and writing on it: 'I will win this one day.'

 after her guide to British tennis was published in Vanity Fair, Pippa 
Middleton arrived with a friend at Queen's tennis club to take in the 
Andy Murray match wearing a mint green twinset

Today The MailIOnline revealed that 
Pippa and her mother are very likely to be present at
 the hospital during sister Kate's labour in July

Remarkably, this means that the 
Middleton family may learn the sex of the new-born future king or queen 
before even the present Queen herself.

Sources have told MailOnline that 
Kate is particularly keen to have her family around her as anxious 
father-to-be William, 30, may be on duty in North Wales, where he is 
still working as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey, 
when the baby arrives.

William is said to be determined to 
make it to the delivery suite, following in the footsteps of his own 
father who broke royal tradition to be with his wife, Diana, Princess of
 Wales, for the birth of both their children. Previous heirs have been 
born at home or Buckingham Palace.
