A tourist on a swamp boat in Louisiana has captured on video the spine-chilling moment a guide jumped in the water to feed a pair of alligators, offering the animals treats directly from his lips.

The footage shot by Stacy Hicks outside Jean Lafitte Historical Park and Preserve last month has gone viral, racking up more than 108,000 shares on Facebook while drawing sharp criticism from state wildlife officials.

While it is not illegal to feed alligators under Louisiana law, Jefferson Parish, where the tour company Airboat Adventures is based, prohibits the risky practice.

'This is not a zoo, this is a natural habitat the animals need to be doing their normal things,’ said Aleutia Scott, of Jean Lafitte Historical Park. 

State wildlife officials are now reviewing the three-minute video to determine if any wrongdoing had taken place. 

MailOnline reached out to Airboat Adventures Wednesday, but a representative declined to comment on the video. 

The footage of the feeding frenzy is also not sitting well with some visitors. 

‘If I wanted to be entertained like that, I would go and see a circus,’ said Sandy Ewart, from Scotland.

Bad precedent: Stacy Hicks, who captured the feeding, was afraid for the guide's life, especially since he revealed he had been bitten recently

The video of the alligator feeding was captured by Stacy Hicks, a kitchenware company consultant from Clatskane, Oregon, who traveled to Louisiana last month for a book lovers' convention.

On May 16, the woman joined 20 other vacationers for a swamp tour in Jean Lafitte led by a guide with Airboat Adventures named Lance.

Mrs Hicks recalled how at one point Lance stunned the group by jumping from the boat into the alligator-infested waters and telling them to have their cameras ready

In the video recorded by the Oregon resident, two large reptiles swim up to Lance, who begins feeding them raw chicken, which he reportedly had stuffed in his pockets.

The guide continues to pet and frolic with the gators, even hugging one of them. The footage culminates with Lance placing a marshmallow thrown to him from the boat by one of the tourists between his lips, which an alligator then gently plucks up.

Hicks later told The New Orleans Times Picayune that she was concerned for the tour guide’s safety, especially since he told the group that he had been bitten a few days earlier.

Colonel John Fortunato, with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, told MailOnline over the phone Wednesday that officials are now in the process of reviewing the video.

The sheriff’s office spokesperson explained that they only recently received a formal complaint about the feeding incident, allowing them to launch an official investigation.
