Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits West Ham counterpart Sam Allardyce may sometimes be criticised for his methods but fans have to accept he 'guarantees' results.

This season Allardyce has added a more attacking element to his style to capitalise on the summer signings of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho and that has taken the Hammers into the top four.

The former Bolton, Newcastle and Blackburn boss has long been associated with a more direct brand of football which brought criticism from his own fans last season, when they finished 14th.

At the end of last season, West Ham fans had lost patience with Allardyce, holding banners at matches

However, that appears to have been forgotten as wins against defending champions Manchester City and runners-up Liverpool have helped the side into the Champions League places.

'Sam is a very experienced manager who has been in this league for a long time,' said Martinez ahead of their meeting at Goodison Park on Saturday.

'He has been building clubs, coping with big expectations, but he always guarantees results.

'What he has done with West Ham this season is find a good balance of a side who can be difficult to play against but still really threaten in dead-ball situations but now they have brought in flair and players who can score goals out of nothing from open play and that is a really strong combination.

'In football you make your own choices and decisions and there are many styles you can play and it is up to fans to like or dislike that.

'Winning is important; for certain people in the game the only thing that matters is the result, for others who are a bit more romantic they appreciate more the way you win or the way you want to play than just the short-term result.

'I think it can be a really successful year for West Ham.'

Martinez's concern as his side return from the international break looking to build on seven points from their last three matches is a growing injury list.

He has 10 players undergoing treatment at the moment, among them left-back Leighton Baines and midfielders James McCarthy, Gareth Barry and Steven Pienaar.

With Baines rated 'touch and go' and John Stones, Antolin Alcaraz and Bryan Oviedo all out, it is likely Martinez will have to tinker with his defence with Luke Garbutt in line for his first Premier League start after a one-minute debut as a substitute in April.

'We have a large squad. I feel they are coping well with the demands we have this season,' said the Spaniard.

'It is nothing different. The team is ready to adapt and cope with variations.

'We have options; Luke Garbutt has been playing really well behind the scenes with the Under-21s.'

At the other end of the scale former academy graduate Leon Osman is set to make his 400th appearance for the club, joining just a dozen players, including the likes of Neville Southall, Brian Labone and Dave Watson, who have reached the landmark.

'It is so difficult to find such a loyal footballer who can also cope with the demands of the modern game,' said Martinez.

'You need to swim against the current because there are so many forces taking you away from spending 10 years at one football club.

'I think Leon Osman and Tony Hibbert are two big pillars for us in the way they have come through the academy, devoted their careers to the club and they are true Evertonians.'
