Justin Bieber has been charged with illegally scrawling graffiti on the wall of a £23 million hotel in Rio de Janiero.

As
 well as childish drawings of faces and baseball caps, the teen star 
scribbled phrases such as 'Bielibers 4 life' and 'respect privacy' on 
the side of the property in upmarket district of Sao Conrado.

A police spokesman described the case as a misdemeanor which will be forwarded to a small-claims court where the Canadian pop star, who flew out of the country on a private jet yesterday, faces a fine.

Caught: Justin Bieber was caught spraying graffiti on walls in Rio de Janeiro in the early hours of his last day in Brazil, it was reported today

Late-night antics: The singer, 19, along with friends and bodyguards, defaced the wall of a hotel in the upmarket district of Sao Conrado after leaving his rented beachside mansion at around 3am on Tuesday morning

Late Tuesday, protected by his 
security detail, Bieber tagged 'Respect privacy' and 'I am off' as well 
as several drawings on a hotel wall in Rio's tourist southern zone.

A
 police probe subsequently established that the 19-year-old pop star had
 received permission from City Hall to tag a wall at another location, 
the Olympic Village in the Vidigal shantytown.

But Bieber's entourage felt he would not be safe there.

'The permission from City Hall did not extend to other locations,' a police statement said.

The hotel - which is being renovated - was bought by a group of Brazilian businessman in 2009 for around £23 million.

Local
 newspaper photographers trying to take pictures of the Canadian idol 
reportedly had to call police after being attacked by members of the 
singer's entourage.

Claims: The picture agency responsible for the images claims one of the photographers had his clothes torn and another had a stone thrown at his vehicle

Crime: Graffiti is considered a crime of vandalism in Brazil which carries a jail sentence of between three months to one year

One paparazzo claimed he was left half-naked after having his clothes ripped off by Bieber's bodyguards.

Another's car was reportedly pelted with bricks they had ripped from the cobblestone pavement. 

The
 singer was later reported to have stuck up his middle finger and 
shouted 'suck my d***' to photographers trying to snap him in the act.

Graffiti is a considered a crime of vandalism in Brazil which carries a jail sentence of between three months to one year.

According to civil police chief Antonio Ricardo, officers tried to locate the Canadian after he left the wall at around 6am.

He was later spotted exercising on the nearby Barra de Tijuca beach.

Last
 night, officers entered the private mansion rented by Bieber during his
 stay in Brazil, but the singer had already left the country.

Upset: Justin Bieber has caused outrage after charging £800 for a very quick 'meet and greet' in Brazil

Today
 Bieber's Brazilian bodyguards were giving statements at a police 
station in Rio's Gavea district after the hotel's owners confirmed they 
had not given the singer permission for the graffiti.

He is now in Paraguay, where he will perform in capital Asuncion tonight.

Rio's
 military police today confirmed they had also started an investigation 
into why officers, who arrived at the scene after being called by 
photographers, failed to arrest the star.

Bieber
 arrived in Brazil on Friday, reserving an entire floor in the famous 
Copacabana Palace hotel where he stayed in the presidential suite.

His
 controversial passage through the country began that night, when he was
 seen leaving a high-class brothel in the city, covered in a bed sheet.

According to reports, he paid for two prostitutes to return with him to the hotel, which refused to let them enter.

Push: The video, which was filmed in secret, shows security pulling people away from Bieber and out of the door

Mere moments: The video shows fans spending just
 one second with the singer before being handed from security member to 
security member

Bieber
 reportedly tried other hotels in the beachside city before heading to a
 rented mansion in a luxury condo in Rio's Joa district, where he stayed
 and later threw a party for 30 hand-picked girls.

On
 Saturday the singer cut short his show in Sao Paulo, storming off the 
stage after a water bottle thrown from the crowd knocked his microphone 
out of his hand.

Instead of 
staying to sing his most famous hit, Baby, he took a private jet - and a
 number of women - back to Rio where he partied in a nightclub until the
 early hours.

Bieber came 
under further fire yesterday after a video emerged showing fans who had 
paid £800 for a 'meet and greet' with the star being allowed just 
seconds in the same room before being manhandled to the exit by 
bodyguards.

MailOnline have requested a comment from Bieber's representatives.

Another scandal: The video emerged just days after he was seen visiting a popular brothel in Brazil
