A plus-sized model curious about global perception of beauty decided to give her photograph to 21 different editors around the world to see how they would use Photoshop to 'perfect her.'

Colombian-American Maria Southard Ospina told the various editors to 'fix' a woman of her size while upholding the ideals of beauty in their country.

Ospina was surprised to discover that in today's weight conscious world, just three out of 21 editors made her appear noticeably thinner.

USA: The USA gave her a longer and thinner face and also gave her darker, straighter hair 

The original: Colombian-American Maria Southard Ospina told the various editors to 'fix' a woman of her size using this original photograph while upholding the ideals of beauty in their country.

Ukraine: Ukraine altered Ospina's body weight the most out of all the countries and gave her a noticeably more slender frame and also thinned out her face 

Mexico: Mexico also slimmed down the photograph but left some of the fullness in her face while also giving her rosier cheeks and dressing her in a pink corset top

Latvia: The Latvian editor slimmed down Ospina's figure and also gave her a more angular face shape 

In her blog entry on Bustle.com, Ospina talks about how Ukraine, Mexico, and Latvia were the only three countries to drastically alter her weight.

Editors from India and Sri Lanka tried to make her appear softer and take away part of her self-described 'double-chin.'

'I must admit that when embarking on this experiment, I pretty much assumed that the majority of the editors would quite drastically change my bone structure and weight,' wrote Ospina.

One editor from Iceland refused to Photoshop her image at all because they didn't believe in digitally altering photographs.

'I don’t believe in re-touching a person’s natural beauty,' said the editor.

The most changed aspect of each photograph was her hair and makeup.

India: Editors from India softened her figure and also edited away some of the fullness from her chin 

Sri-Lanka: Editors from Sri-Lanka also softened the appearance of her face, minimized some of her chin, and added a flushed cheek and rosy pink lips 

Iceland: Ice;and refused to Photoshop the image because they don't believe in altering natural beauty 

'If I was to try to find some correlations between all of them, the closest thing to a common thread would be the changes in hair and makeup. From pink lips to overly-blushed cheeks to intense and striking eye shadow (Italy, I kinda like what you did there!),' she said.

Most Photoshop artists edited out her mole, a feature she likes to accentuate because of Marilyn Monroe's iconic facial staple.

'Maybe this eradication of the mole signals that any kind of blemish — even a natural beauty mark — just doesn't fit in with standards of perfection,' she said.

Opsina notes that her hair transformation was very varied among different countries.

'Bulgaria, Macedonia and Bangladesh all did pretty unusual and striking things,' she wrote.

Italy: Italy didn't do much to alter Ospina's frame but they added some dramatic makeup to give her a more glamorous look and even left the mole on her face 

Bulgaria: Bulgaria gave Ospina lighter and longer hair and paired the look with neutral toned cosmetics

Macedonia: Macedonia handed in two vastly different Photoshop images to Ospina's surprise 

Bangladesh: Like Macedonia, Bangladesh had two varying interpretations of beauty when editing the photo

Uruguay: Uruguay darkened her skin and gave her more defined cheekbones and a more slender nose 

She noted that femininity isn’t defined the same way in every country and that in some edits her hair appeared longer and shinier while other edits kept her hair short.

Canada seemed to take a satirical approach to photo shopping when they gave her a short blonde do and a 'chunky, badly placed sweater.'

Ospina posed in the photograph wearing merely a towel and editors were given the liberty to dress her any way they pleased. Ospina says she was shocked when one editor asked her if she was 'porn.'

Some countries may have viewed the feminine form as something needed to be covered up while others left her shoulders bare.

Despite the range of edits to her original photograph Ospina concluded that natural beauty may be making a reappearance.

'I’ve always wanted to live in a society in which freckles and moles and double chins and natural wrinkles were embraced, rather than hidden away and caked in foundation,' she wrote. 

Perhaps natural beauty is making a comeback, after all.  

Australia: The image from Australia has the slightest of changes to the original photograph  

 United Kingdom: Ospina's boyfriend of England did very little to alter his girlfriend's natural beauty 

Canada: Canada may have taken a satirical approach to Photoshopping with this paper-doll like rendering 

Vietnam: Vietnam gave Ospina a warmer complexion, thinned out her face a bit, and gave her redder lips 

Pakistan: One editor from Pakistan gave her darker redder lips and also added a colorful background to highlight her features while the other dressed her and gave her blue eyes 

Jamaica: Jamaica gave her tint a more yellow hue and left her make-up fairly natural
