North Korea fired four suspected short-range missiles into its eastern waters on Thursday, a South Korean defense official said, in an apparent effort to protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military exercises that Pyongyang calls a rehearsal for invasion.

The launches, however, weren't expected to raise tension as North Korea routinely tests short-range missiles and it has recently sought better ties with South Korea in what outside analysts say is an attempt to win badly-needed foreign investment and aid.

The rival Koreas this month held their first reunions of Korean War-divided families in more than three years.

Mystery: The North Korean projectiles were suspected to be Scud missiles but they could also be an upgraded version of its newly developed surface-to-ship KN-02 missiles or new types of artillery

The projectiles that landed off the North's eastern coast were believed to be short-range missiles with a range of more than 200 kilometers (about 125 miles). The South Korean Defense Ministry officials who discussed the launches spoke anonymously, citing ministry rules.

The officials said they were trying to learn exactly what North Korea launched and that South Korea has bolstered its monitoring on North Korea.

Yonhap news agency, citing an unidentified military official, reported the North Korean projectiles were suspected to be Scud missiles but they could also be an upgraded version of its newly developed surface-to-ship KN-02 missiles or new types of artillery.

Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North 
Korea studies at Seoul's Dongguk University, played down the 
significance of the launches, saying the North appears to have intended 
to protest the South Korean-U.S. military drills that began Monday or to
 grab international attention as there has been little progress over a 
push to resume disarmament-for-aid negotiations.

Yang
 Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in 
Seoul, said the North also needs such launches to examine its weapons.

Last
 year, North Korea furiously reacted to the same South Korean-U.S. 
military drills by issuing a torrent of fiery rhetoric and threats to 
launch nuclear missiles against Seoul and Washington. Last year's drills
 came after North Korea conducted its third nuclear test. The U.S. took 
the unusual step of sending nuclear-capable bombers in a show of its 
resolve to protect its ally.

North Korea hasn't issued any harsh rhetoric against the current drills. Pyongyang earlier threatened to scrap the arrangement for the family reunions but later allowed them to proceed after high-level talks with Seoul. South Korea on Monday offered sending vaccines and disinfectants to North Korea after the country recently reported its first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease since April 2011.

Earlier Thursday, North Korea presented to the media a South Korean missionary who it says was arrested last year for allegedly trying to establish underground Christian churches in the country. South Korea urged North Korea to quickly release him.

The Korean Peninsula officially remains at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 American troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea. Â
