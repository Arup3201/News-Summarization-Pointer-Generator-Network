A 12-year-old Georgia girl who vanished Monday morning after leaving the house just to take out the trash and became the subject of a huge community and police search has returned home.

It appeared late Monday night that Peachtree Corners girl Kelsie Lee had simply run away after motorists found her walking along a roadway and returned her home around 11pm.

Her recovery came just a few nail-biting hours after police called off the search as night fell over Gwinnett County.

Lost and found: Kelsie Lee was missing for hours Monday but a motorist found her walking down a street and she was home by 11pm, having apparently run away

Lee's mother must now be equal parts angry and relieved after frantically reporting her daughter missing around 8:45am and the 
desperate search that ensued.

While
 community members and friends eager to help authorities find Kelsie 
swarmed to aid in the search, by Monday evening police said they were 
quickly running out of leads.

Kelsie was with her sister in their comfortable Gwinnett County home when she told her sister she was taking out the garbage.

The
 5-foot-2, blue eyed girl wore a long black sweater with a western 
motif, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, when she was last seen 
in the 4500 block of Jones Bridge Circle.

A
 police helicopter was dispatched and a command center set up at a 
nearby church around as the neighborhood rallied to find Kelsie.

'When
 we heard about it, we just dropped everything to see how we could 
assist,' volunteer Gwendolyn Richardson told MyFoxAtlanta.

But
 eight hours into the extensive search and no new information made some 
volunteers concerned something sinister could have happened to Kelsie.

'It just gives you this sick feeling in the pit of your stomach, being a parent,' said Bill Salokar.

Meanwhile,
 another volunteer revealed that Kelsie's diary was found and it 
contained some mention of running away, leaving the possibility open 
that she left of her own free will.

Police
 said there was no evidence Kelsie was the victim of foul play but were 
unable to rule out any potential reason for her disappearance.

'We're
 taking it very seriously. Out officers are here, we're inviestigating 
it thoroughly,' said a Gwinnett County police spokesman. 'And as soon as
 we find out what happened to her, we'll go from there.'Right now, we're
 treating it like a missing person.'
