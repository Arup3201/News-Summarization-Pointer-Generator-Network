Billionaire former Tory chairman Lord Ashcroft has released a series of polls carried out in key swing constituencies

Labour is tightening its grip on key election battlegrounds across the country as Tory voters desert to Ukip, according to a major new poll.

The survey of eight Tory-held marginal constituencies shows that each one would fall to Labour if an election were held tomorrow.

And polling in four Labour-held marginal seats suggests only one would be a close contest, with Labour comfortably holding the other three.

The study, conducted by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests David Cameron still has a mountain to climb in order to stay in Number 10 next year.

And it suggests that Ed Miliband’s prospects are being boosted by the reluctance of Tory defectors to Ukip to desert Nigel Farage.

Just under seven out of 10 people who voted Conservative in 2010 said they would do so again next year. Of the remainder some 17 per cent said they would now vote Ukip.

The findings will increase pressure on Mr Cameron to adopt a tougher line on both Europe and immigration in the run-up to the election in a bid to persuade defectors to return to the Tory fold.

Mr Miliband receives a further boost from the collapse of the Liberal Democrat vote. Barely a quarter of those who voted Lib Dem last time say they will do so again. Of those who did not almost a third say they will now vote Labour.

Lord Ashcroft said the findings ‘confirm my view that it’s going to be close, but the Tories have most to do’.

Lord Ashcroft’s research has previously looked at the 12 most marginal Conservative-held seats, where he has found a strong swing to Labour.

This time, polling focused on the ‘second tier’ of marginal seats, where Labour needs a bigger swing to win.

Voters were polled in Bedford, Carlisle, Dewsbury, Lincoln, Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, Stroud, Warrington South and Weaver Vale. In all eight seats Labour would now win, thanks to an average swing from the Tories of 6.5 per cent.

Ukip achieved double-digit support in each of the seats, and attracted support of more than 20 per cent in Carlisle, Dewsbury and Plymouth.

The Lib-Dems, by comparison, failed to reach 10 per cent in any of the seats.

The polling also revealed that Labour would hold on to three key marginal seats – Bolton West, Birmingham Edgbaston and Hampstead and Kilburn. Only in Southampton Itchen would the Tories run them close.

The polling appears to confirm the Tories’ key message that Tory supporters who back Ukip risk putting Mr Miliband into power by the back door. 

Tory high command plans to hammer home the message ‘Vote Ukip, get Miliband’ next year. But more than two-fifths of Tory defectors (41 per cent) polled in the latest survey ruled out going back to the Conservatives under any circumstances.

But despite the apparently gloomy message for Mr Cameron, the new survey contains some cheer for Tory supporters.

Despite the average 10-point Labour lead in the marginal seats polled, the majority of voters in these constituencies are either satisfied with Mr Cameron’ s performance (29 per cent) or prefer him to Mr Miliband (29 per cent). Just 31 per cent of voters in these seats (including only two-thirds of Labour voters) would prefer to see the Labour leader in Number 10.

In another positive finding, the majority of voters in all twelve seats polled believe the economy will do well for both the country and their own families in the coming year – suggesting that Labour’s focus on the cost of living ‘crisis’ may be running out of steam.
