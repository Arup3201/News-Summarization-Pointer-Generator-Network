A Cairo hotel was firebombed by angry residents in violent clashes today that after a man was gunned down in a stand-off with police.

Dozens of civilians with Molotov cocktails have set light to several parked vehicles beside the Nile City Towers complex and attacked parts of the building.

Local residents previously attacked 
the towers on June 27 when staff there allegedly refused to provide 
water to put out a fire that had engulfed one of their wooden shacks and
led to the death of a five-year old boy.

A statement issued by Orascom 
Construction Industries, which has an office in the towers, claims the latest 
incident was sparked when a man entered the adjoining Fairmont Hotel and
demanded money, threatening people with a knife.

Police officers confronted the man and was attacked, the statement said, before an officer shot and killed him.

Arriving in three minibuses and a fleet of motorcycles a number assailants attacked the building in retaliation.

These residents are believed to live on valuable 
Nile-front land and have been involved in a long-running dispute with 
developers seeking to acquire prime Cairo real estate.

Cairo Governorate issued a directive on June 20 authorising local police to evict them.

Security and emergency services have arrived at the scene in a bid to quell the situation with surrounding roads currently completely blocked to other traffic.

'Immediately after the residents of the shacks behind Nile City came to attack the hotel and tried to burn it down," the statement read.

The management of Nile City sealed the building after residents began to burn motorcycles and cars in the forecourt.

The violence is focused around the north tower and the adjacent Fairmont Hotel. Injury and death tolls are yet to be confirmed.

The worrying scenes come just a day 
after erupting sectarian violence in a village near Cairo, started after
the death of a Muslim man.

Violence first erupted in 
Dahshour on Friday following an argument between a Christian laundry 
worker and his client, a Muslim, whose shirt he burned.

The Muslim man 
and friends went to the Christian's home to continue the argument, 
provoking the Christian to lob firebombs at the crowd gathering outside 
his home. 

The
firebombs injured a bystander who died Tuesday of his wounds, further 
aggravating tensions.

A group of Muslims tried to attack the local 
church, but other Muslims protected it until security forces arrived and
dispersed the mob, but the tensions have prompted all the local Christians to flee.

About 10 percent of Egypt's mainly Muslim 82 million people are Christian.

Security officials said police fired tear gas early Wednesday at angry Muslims who were trying to set fire to the local church.

The rioters, who were returning from the burial of the Muslim man who died in the clashes, damaged several Christian properties and set three police trucks on fire. 

Sixteen people, including 10 
policemen, were injured, said the security officials, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release 
information to reporters.

The local Giza Archbishop's office 
said in a statement that the Christian families fled the village fearing
further attacks from Muslims.

The rioters 'broke the church's windows, and doors of homes nearby,' the statement said. While security forces prevented a further attack on the church, the rioters 'looted and torched the shops (of Christians), including a jewelry shop ... and terrorized the local community, forcing them to leave their homes.'

Sayed Hamam, a 22-year old university student and resident of Dahshour, said security was heavily deployed in the village, and reconciliation attempts were under way to bring the Christians back. He said most have moved to a nearby village.

'We are very saddened,' he said. 'We 
used to pride ourselves on how peacefully we lived together for years. 
We are considering it a big feud in one clan, not a Muslim-Christian 
fight.'

Hamam said the police and big 
families in the village are in talks with the local priest and the 
father of the killed resident to calm the tension.

The Coptic Christian laundry worker 
who threw the deadly firebombs, his father and brother have been 
detained and charged with premeditated murder and possession of 
explosives, the group said.

Five Muslims involved in the violence are wanted in the case but have yet to be detained, it added.

The violence came after the U.S. State Department said in its annual report on religious freedom in 2011 that Egypt's government has failed to curb violence against the Christian minority and has at times itself been involved in the violence.

It also criticised the government's recurrent denial that the violence is sectarian in nature, often blaming it on criminal or family disputes. 

'The government generally failed to investigate and prosecute effectively perpetrators of violence against Coptic Christians and continued to favor informal `reconciliation sessions,' which generally precluded criminal prosecution for crimes against Copts and contributed to a climate of impunity that encouraged further assaults,' the report said.
