Catbird seat: Assad denied on Fox News this week that he had used chemical weapons against his own people, and with the White House seesawing on regime change, he's positioned well to keep his job

A senior White House official told reporters Friday that the Obama administration wants Bashar al-Assad 'remove[d] from power.' But an examination of the government's vacillating position on whether the Syrian dictator must go reveals a schizophrenic policy that has changed at least four times this year.

''There needs to be a political resolution to the civil war that removes Assad from power,' Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said during an on-the-record conference call.

That position has been a consistent theme for eight days, but was preceded by two weeks of White House assurances that the possibility of U.S. military action in Syria was not intended to force 'regime change.'

In the past six months, a MailOnline analysis reveals, President Obama and his senior aides have said at least seven times that Assad must go, but insisted on at least five other occasions that the U.S. isn't aiming to see him leave.

All of those assurances that the White House wasn't angling for regime change came after the August 21 chemical weapons attack that the U.S. and United Nations maintain was the work of Assad's armed forces.

During a March 20 joint press conference in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Obama said he believed 'that the Assad regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy.'

'I think Assad must go – and I believe he will go,' the president said.

Obama told Bibi and his countrymen that 'the Assad regime has lost all credibility and legitimacy. I think Assad must go -- and I believe he will go.'

A somber Jay Carney told reporters on May 29 that 'as a matter of United States policy that we believe that Assad must not continue to rule Syria'

What a difference! On August 27 the same Carney insisted: 'I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change'

He echoed that call the following day in a speech to the Israeli people, saying that 'Assad must go so that Syria’s future can begin.'

Two different White House spokesmen followed suit in May.

'We have been making clear as a matter of United States policy that we believe that Assad must not continue to rule Syria, that he has massacred his own people, that he has the blood of his own people on his hands,' press secretary Jay Carney said May 29 in the White House briefing room.

Standing in for Carney two days later, his deputy Josh Earnest insisted that 'we have said that Assad must go and that there is no future for him in Syria.

'And that is not just our opinion,' he added, 'but ... that is the will of the Syrian people that they’ve made clear.'

The White House was officially silent on the matter through June and July, as a trio of scandals consumed its public oxygen.

Obama hedged his bets on PBS, saying both that he had 'called for Assad to leave' and that military strikes 'would not help the situation on the ground'

New revelations about the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attack, journalists' complaints that the Department of Justice was spying on them, and the IRS's admission that it had targeted conservative groups for their political beliefs pushed Syria – and most of the administration's other international priorities – to the back burner.

After the August 21 chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta suburbs near Damascus, the White House re-engaged.

But suddenly, regime change was off the table as Obama tried to persuade Congress to authorize military action to neutralize Assad's ability to launch future chemical weapons campaigns.

'I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change,' Carney said on August 28 during his daily press briefing.

On August 29, Obama himself offered a diplomatic analysis on the PBS NewsHour that hedged his bets, reminding host Judy Woodruff that he had 'called for Assad to leave and make sure that we got a transitional government that could be inclusive in Syria.'

'What I’ve also concluded,' he quickly added, 'is that direct military engagement, involvement in the civil war in Syria, would not help the situation on the ground.'

Obama was 'candid yesterday in his interview,' a senior White House official told journalists a day later, 'about the fact that we're not talking about regime change here.'

Rhodes said Sept. 6 in St. Petersburg, Russia during the G-20 economic summit that any action the U.S. might take against Assad 'would not have the aim of accomplishing regime change.'

Carney used similar language on Sept. 11 in Washington, saying that 'the potential use of limited military strikes by the United States ... was not designed to precipitate regime change.'

But a day later at the same podium, he emphasized that 'it is still our policy and our view that Syria’s future cannot have Assad in the picture.'

'It’s inconceivable,' Carney explained, 'given what he has done to his own people. But this is something that we have said all along needs to be decided in a political settlement.  It is not something that will be decided militarily.'

On May 31, Josh Earnest trumpeted an absolutist posture from the White House podium: 'We have said that Assad must go and that there is no future for him in Syria. And that is not just our opinion, but ... that is the will of the Syrian people' ...

... but National Security Advisor Susan Rice flatly assured a left-of-center audience on September 9 that any military action the U.S. might take 'would not aim to topple Assad or, by themselves, to effect regime change'

Anti-war demonstrations at the U.S. Capitol and the White House have provided pressure against military intervention, which the administration now says it hopes to avoid

The most recent administration statement about Assad's future, before Rhodes' candid admission on Friday, came during a Sept. 17 State Department press briefing when spokeswoman Jen Psaki was challenged on the Obama government's changing stance.

'Our position hasn’t changed, that we don’t see a future for Assad in – a future in Syria with – that includes Assad,' Psaki fumbled. 'And that hasn’t changed.'

A reporter, however, questioned how the administration's choice to pursue diplomacy through the United Nations could result in deposing Assad.

'I understand that you want that to happen,' he said, according to a State Department transcript, 'but this agreement pretty much gives Assad job security, don’t you agree? ... I mean, he is the one that is being tasked with implementing this agreement, so until the agreement is implemented, I mean, he’s the person that will be implementing it.'

'No, I don’t agree,' Psaki countered.

'Our view and how we have – would press this and what we've discussed with our partners, is that any individual, any government that is in place, whether that’s a transitional government, whatever it may be, would be in charge of implementing this.'

Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson would seem to disagree.

He observed Sept. 15 on CNN's Face The Nation program that 'Assad used chemical weapons and improved his job security. That's not a particularly good message to other dictators.'

During Friday's conference call, Rhodes took questions from journalists at PBS, CBS, CNN, The Washington Post, Bloomberg News and the Press Trust of India, but did not call on MailOnline.
