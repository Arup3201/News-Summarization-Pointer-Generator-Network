A millionaire couple turned tradition on its head by handing out £100,000 cash in red envelopes to well-wishers during their lavish nuptials in China.

The bride and groom, aged their mid-20s, arranged for 'volunteers' to hand out envelopes of money to onlookers lining the streets to watch their wedding convoy of supercars in Dongguan.

It is Chinese tradition to give away 'little red envelopes' of cash at weddings, but it is the guests who gift the bride and groom with money, not the other way around.

The bride and groom, both in their mid-20s, are believed to be multi-millionaires

The couple were not named, but the groom is reportedly the multimillionaire owner and manager of an e-commerce company that apparently only started trading a year ago.

'I only started trading recently and we had a huge financial windfall, and I wanted to make everyone shared in my good fortune to bring luck for me and my bride in our future life together,' the groom told local media.

The envelopes contained amounts ranging between the equivalent of £1 to £10, a relatively large amount by Chinese standards and guaranteeing an enthusiastic reception for the bride and groom.

They were taken to the ceremony in a stretch Hummer limousine, which was followed by a range of supercars, including Lamborghinis and Porsches.

Pictures show the enthusiastic waving crowd in Guangdong province clutching the red envelopes and wishing the happy couple good luck.

Observers accused the couple of being part of an elaborate PR stunt for a local company looking to grab headlines and promote their name.
