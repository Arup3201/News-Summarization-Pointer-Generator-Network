Tragic: Robert Berry, 42, collapsed at the finish line of the London Marathon and was later pronounced dead at hospital

The family of a London Marathon runner who died after completing the course have paid tribute to a 'a fun-loving and caring person'.

Robert Berry, 42, was given medical attention when he collapsed immediately after finishing the 26.2-mile race, and was pronounced dead at hospital.

Since his death on Sunday, well-wishers have flooded his JustGiving page, with donations reaching £63,000.

Mr Berry, from Reading, Berkshire, had aimed to raise £1,700 for the National Osteoporosis Society in tribute to his 'inspirational' mother, who was diagnosed with the brittle bone condition at the age of 52.

In a statement issued by his family, they thanked the thousands of people who gave their support, words of comfort and donations.

They described Mr Berry as 'a keen sportsman' who from an early age joined the Rustington Otters Football team at the age of nine.

The statement read: 'He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and work colleagues - a fun-loving and caring person, respected, loyal and very much loved by us all.

'He was a loving husband to Gwen and an amazing father to his two children and will remain forever in their hearts. Rob was a loyal and loving son to Alan and Ann and a fantastic, caring brother to his younger sister Janet who always looked up to him.'

The family said they were devastated and shocked by his death and added: '(We) cannot believe that he is no longer with us to share in our lives and laughter... Rob will be a great loss to our family.'

But they said they were 'overwhelmed by the heartfelt messages and donations'.

Mr Berry, who worked in IT services, ran the Reading half-marathon last month.

His family said he had become a keen runner in recent years and 'the marathon was something he wanted to achieve whilst raising money for a cause close to all our hearts.

'He has left us having completed a world renowned race which makes us so very proud and in our eyes Rob is a hero.'

The
 keen runner's goal for the marathon was to run it in less than three 
hours and 30 minutes. His actual time has not been disclosed.

Mr Berry wrote on his blog that he suffered breathing problems in the weeks before the race.

He described how breathing during a training run was 'a big struggle' in a post just seven days before Sunday's event.

'I have now used my inhaler three times in the last week whereas I might use it three times in year,' he wrote.

According
 to his online training results, Mr Berry had been preparing for the 
marathon since December and had completed training runs of over 20 
miles.

Yesterday, a spokesman for the charity he was raising money for, said: 'We
 are really touched by the incredible generosity in tribute to Mr Berry,
 who wrote so movingly about why he was raising money to help fight 
osteoporosis.

'When the 
time is right, we would like to discuss with his family the options 
available for how the funds raised in his memory may be used.

Mr Berry's wife Gwen saw him collapse at the finishing line before he died, it was revealed today.

The 46-year-old had followed the father-of-two along the route by catching Tube trains with her sister Janet, 40.

The pair then saw him fall after finishing Sunday's race.

Mr Berry, 42, was given medical attention immediately but was pronounced dead at hospital yesterday.

Mrs Berry told The Sun he was a 'splendid father'.

Mr Berry's father Herbert, 79, said: 'They were at the finish when he crossed. Janet couldn't believe it when he collapsed.

Experienced: Mr Berry had run numerous races in preparation for the Marathon and was expected to complete it in under three hours and 20 minutes

'He was fit and healthy. Janet's devastated, as is the whole family.'

IT
 worker Mr Berry, of Newbury, Berkshire, was an experienced runner who 
hoped to run the route in less than three hours and 20 minutes.

But the father-of-two kept a blog which detailed the breathing difficulties he was suffering in the lead-up to the race.

On April 6, he described having to use his inhaler three times in a week, when he usually only needed it three times a year.

He wrote: 'I have now used my inhaler three times in the last week whereas I might use it three times in year.

'Today
 started out very slow and breathing a big struggle but it got much 
better as the run went on and I finished 12.5 miles. Feeling strong. 
Last week before the Marathon.'

Earlier that week he had written that his breathing was 'still not too 
good'. He wrote: 'Yesterday I did a gentle five miles as my breathing 
still not too good and knees a little achy.

'Today
 on the other hand my eyes were itching, nose running and breathing a 
big struggle, also in the office all day after the gym.

'Was
 talking to Nicola from the National Osteoporosis Society via email and 
she seems to think this is not hay fever but due to pollution and the 
dust from the Sahara. Hope so as I don't want to be running like this 
during the Marathon.'

Mr 
Berry, who leaves behind wife Gwen, daughter Hannah, 12, and son Martin,
 10, was running the race to raise money for the National Osteoporosis 
Society after his mother Ann, 72, was diagnosed with osteoporosis 20 
years ago. 

Mr Berry wrote on his fundraising page: 
'I'm running the London Marathon in support of the National Osteoporosis
 Society for the support given to my mother who was diagnosed with 
osteoporosis at the age of 52 but whose current condition (we found out 
later) was triggered from a lifting incident at the age of 47.

'Because of the stress on her lower back, two sets of bones in her lower spine collapsed.'

In
 a touching message on his own website, he added: 'This page is 
dedicated to my mum, who despite being diagnosed with osteoporosis at 
the relatively early age of 52 years, has been an inspiration through 
the continued positive outlook she has displayed ever since, despite 
some quite clear discomfort.'

He had completed a half marathon in 
an hour and 30 minutes in September last year and achieved a time of two
 hours, 36 minutes and 53 seconds at a 21-mile event in March.

Mr Berry also took part in last month’s Reading Half Marathon, with a finishing time of 1:31:18. Tributes and donations began pouring in to his JustGiving page after news of his death broke.

The
 total amount raised at 7pm on Monday stood at almost £3,000 - with the 
number of donations doubling from 65 to 130 in the hour since his death 
was announced.

By 9pm on Tuesday, the figure had reached more than £11,000. By midnight, it 
had topped £20,000. And at 8am yesterday morning it was already more than 
£27,000. Before 11am yesterday it had hit £36,000. And at 1pm it was more than £43,000. By 4pm it had breached the £50,000 mark.
