Animal lovers were outraged yesterday over a video showing a woman kicking a horse which is now the subject of an RSPCA investigation.

The woman, who is yet to be identified, was caught on film repeatedly booting the horse in the legs as it stood in a field in Swansea, South Wales.

Before assaulting the animal, the woman is seen pointing and screaming at it. When the animal refuses to move she then begins kicking it.

The 30 second video was recently passed on to the RSPCA who are now investigating.

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'The RSPCA would urge anyone who has information about this to contact us directly.

'Those found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to animals could face a maximum six months in prison and a £20,000 fine.'

The spokeswoman described the incident as a 'cruel and senseless act' and urged anyone who knows the woman involved to contact them.

The video was passed onto the RSPCA by animal welfare group Friends of Swansea Horses. It is understood to be up to nine months old.

One animal lover from Swansea, who did not want to be named, said: 'It’s disgusting how anyone could think this is an acceptable way to treat any animal let alone one as sensitive and loyal as a horse.

'I really hope they catch the woman who did this before she gets the chance to strike again.'

The RSPCA can be reached on 0300 1234 999 in confidence.
