Jailed: Andrew Dmytruk, 50

A British holidaymaker with a mental age of seven has been jailed for four years and four months after he admitted starting a fire in a Spanish hotel.

Andrew Dmytruk, 51, from Nottingham, who has suffered from serious mental health problems since contracting meningitis as a baby, started a fire at a complex in Benidorm, on the Costa Blanca, in December 2010,

Mr Dmytruk's lawyer's Marcos Castaner yesterday reached a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors who had been calling for him to be jailed for nine years.

During a hearing at the Provincial Court in Alicante Mr Dmytruk, who has been on remand since the incident, agreed to plead guilty if the sentence was reduced to four years and four months.

He had been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his widowed mother, Doris O'Brien, at the time of the incident. She says he is innocent and did not start the hotel fire.

The three-star Ambassador hotel was evacuated after Dmytruk allegedly set fire to his room.

The 10-storey, 200-room hotel filled with black smoke and 13 Brits, mostly pensioners, were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.

Doctors said he was fit to stand trial for arson, but Fair Trials International previously said: 'Owing to complications from meningitis that he suffered as a baby, Andrew has the mental age of a young child.

'He has been refusing much of the food 
given to him and in March 2012 he attempted suicide, leaving him 
increasingly withdrawn and his mother increasingly worried.'

The group said Dmytuk has been denied bail largely because he is a foreigner.

Benidorm, near Alicante on Spain's east 
coast, attracts around a million Britons each year, making it one of our
favourite holiday destinations.
