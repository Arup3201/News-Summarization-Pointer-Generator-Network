A match in Ecuador's Primera Division descended into chaos after both Barcelona's goalkeeper and his replacement were sent off.

In the 42nd minute of their match against Independiente, Barcelona keeper Maximo Banguera was shown a red card by referee Vinicio Espinel after receiving a second yellow - both for time-wasting.

Before Banguera's replacement, Damian Lanza, could get on to the pitch, the referee produced his red card again to send him off. The fourth official had informed the referee that Lanza was accusing him of being bought by Independiente.

Lanza appeared to be completely bemused by what had happened before removing his gloves to angrily confront the referee and his officials.

Once order had been restored, Barcelona striker Ismael Blanco donned the gloves before being replaced by midfielder Alex Bolanos in the second half. 

Barcelona unsurprisingly went on to lose the match 2-1 to their rivals.
