Big tobacco has jumped en masse into the e-cigarette market and will have an unlikely competitor in tech billionaire Sean Parker, who’s also recently entered the growing fray.

On Tuesday, Altria Group Inc. announced the details of its foray into the market with an electronic cigarette branded MarkTen. Starting in August, the company says it will launch the product in Indiana.

Altria, which owns the nation’s biggest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, became the last of major tobacco companies to take the plunge and, oddly enough, they were also behind billionaire former Facebook president Sean Parker.

The newlywed tech founder is also newly invested in NJOY, a leader in the battery-powered, cigarette alternative market. Parker recently invested $10 million in the Arizona-based company, which also has an investor in musician Bruno Mars and a spokeswoman in troubled rock musician Courtney Love.

‘There's a huge opportunity to transition the entire world away from dangerous, carcinogenic, combusting cigarettes,’ Parker told the Wall Street Journal.

If he’s right, he and his tobacco company competition are in for a big pay day.

The market for e-cigarettes, which includes more than 250 brands, has grown from the thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide. Analysts estimate sales could double this year to $1 billion. Some go as far as saying consumption of e-cigs could surpass consumption of traditional cigarettes in the next decade.

And that’s only 1 percent of today’s total tobacco market.

During an investor presentation on Tuesday, Altria CEO Marty Barrington said the company has ‘spent a good deal of time studying the category and the business opportunity.’

‘The category is in its early stages and time will tell how it will evolve,’ Barrington said.

Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine solution, creating vapor that users inhale.

Devotees say e-cigarettes address both the addictive and behavioral aspects of smoking. Smokers get their nicotine without the more than 4,000 chemicals found in regular cigarettes. And they get to hold something shaped like a cigarette, while puffing and exhaling something that looks like smoke.

MarkTen, made in China by a contract manufacturer, is expected to sell for about $9.50. The liquid for the cartridges is being produced in the U.S.

Last week, Reynolds American Inc., owner of the nation's second-biggest tobacco company, announced that it is launching a revamped version of its Vuse brand electronic cigarette in Colorado in July, with its sights set on expanding nationally.

Lorillard Inc., the nation's third-biggest tobacco company, acquired e-cigarette maker Blu Ecigs in April 2012 and has expanded to more than 80,000 retail outlets.

Bets on e-cigarettes may seem promising but they’re still not a sure thing.

The move toward e-cigarettes by tobacco 
makers comes at a time when the once mighty industry is in decline. In 
1965, 42 percent of adults smoked, according to the CDC. In 2010, that 
number was at 19 percent.

However, some of the same forces slowing down demand for traditional tobacco could affect the battery-powered stuff.

The Food and Drug Administration plans to assert regulatory authority over e-cigarettes in the near future. Public health officials say the safety of e-cigarettes and their effectiveness in helping people quit regular smokes haven't been fully studied.

According to the Washington Post, three states have thus far banned the use of e-cigarettes in enclosed indoor spaces and the industry could face some of the same steep taxation that has become the foe of cigarette companies and a weapon wielded by governments in their war against tobacco use.

Despite all the hopeful attention given to the burgeoning industry, not everyone is convinced of its promise.

‘This industry is in decline, whether people want to admit it or not,’ tobacco industry expert Jack Russo told the Post. ‘It's far too early to be calling this the next horizon. There's still a lot of question marks.’

Russo called big tobacco’s embrace of the once-miniscule industry ‘almost a desperation-type behaviour.’Meanwhile, Sean Parker remains hopeful.

‘The clever application of technology might someday obsolete the combustion cigarette,’ he said, ‘and all the harm it causes.’
