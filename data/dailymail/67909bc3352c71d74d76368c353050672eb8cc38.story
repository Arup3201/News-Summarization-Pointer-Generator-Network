Two container ships collided at the northern end of Egypt's Suez Canal, delaying traffic through a vital global trade route, shipping sources said yesterday.

The German-flagged MV Colombo Express and the Singaporean-flagged MV Maersk Tanjong collided at the mouth of the canal, knocking three containers from the Colombo Express into the sea, and causing a 65 foot long dent to the vessel, the sources said.

The collision was expected to delay traffic through the canal in both directions.

The vessels, the German-flagged MV Colombo Express and the Singaporean MV Maersk Tanjong, appeared to be travelling side by side before the collisionÂ 

Agents Inchape Shipping Services said: 'The incident has severely interrupted the second southbound convoy and the northbound convoy is therefore expected to be delayed.'

The Suez Canal is one of the world's most strategic waterways, facilitating much of the maritime trade between Europe and Asia, providing about $5 billion in annual revenue for Egypt.

Three containers were knocked from the Colombo Express during the accident which delayed traffic through the Suez Canal in both directions; both ships remain parked in the canal lakes while authorities investigate the incident

Both ships remain parked in the canal lakes as Suez authorities retrieve the containers from the water and complete an investigation.

No casualties were reported, but the Colombo Express sustained a 65 foot dent to its left side, Agents Inchape said.
