Jailed: Paul Hyde, 46, went on a destruction spree in Billericay, Essex, after his fiancee broke up with him

An axe-wielding man went on a destruction spree causing nearly £50,000 worth of damage after a row with his fiancee over a Valentine's Day card.

Paul Hyde, 46, used a four-foot axe to destroy cars and homes in a quiet street in Billericay, Essex, as terrified homeowners barricaded themselves inside.

He has been jailed after admitting threatening to kill residents on the street following the break-up of his year-long whirlwind romance with Alison Hall.

Basildon Crown Court heard how Hyde's violent rage was triggered by an argument with his now ex-fiancee when he went to collect his belongings from her home the day after Valentine's this year.

Miss Hall had dumped him by text for 'not showing enough gratitude' for the Valentine's Day card she had given him the day before.

When Miss Hall arrived home from work shortly after 5pm she found Hyde swallowing paracetamol tablets whilst downing whisky.

A heated argument ensued and Hyde threatened to kill Miss Hall but she managed to wriggle free of his grip and fled the property.

Hyde then grabbed a four-foot axe from the house and began his costly destruction spree by smashing his way into the house of her 49-year-old neighbour Pauline Hilton.

He bashed Ms Hilton around the face before holding the axe across her throat as her terrified daughter Gemma Hilton, 27, locked herself in the upstairs bathroom and called police.

His rampage then spilled out into the street where he began violently hacking at parked cars and front doors as terrified neighbours watched on in horror.

Hyde's rampage of destruction - which caused a total of £48,000 worth of damage - was eventually ended when armed police used rubber bullets to disarm him.

The rampage lasted around 20 minutes - causing thousands of pounds' worth of damage before police could stop Hyde

Jailing Hyde for four-and-a-half years for 18 separate offences on Thursday, Judge David Owen-Jones told him: 'You simply lost it. You went on a rampage with the axe and threatened lots of your neighbours.

'Everyone involved in this terrible incident has been psychologically affected and it has devastated a neighbourhood.

'You threatened to kill your ex-partner and she must have been terrified out of her wits.

'You did not stop and went from house to house threatening neighbours with the axe. What you did was simply unbelievable.'

Victim Pauline Hilton attended court on Thursday and spoke after Hyde's sentencing about the devastating effect the attack has had on their quiet neighbourhood.

She said: 'No amount of time for a sentence will compare to the utter trauma we've been through.

'We've been so impacted by this and it's something none of us will ever forget but you have to try to move on.

'Everyone involved has been psychologically affected and it has devastated a neighbourhood.'

Hyde was given a restraining order banning him from visiting Patricia Gardens, in Billericay, Essex, or contacting any of his victims.
