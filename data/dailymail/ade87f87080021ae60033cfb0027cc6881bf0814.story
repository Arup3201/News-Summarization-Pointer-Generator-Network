Aleksandra Wozniak followed up her victory over Heather Watson by beating Britain's last hope Johanna Konta at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham.

Wozniak, who saved three match points in beating Watson in the first round, had an easier time of it against British number three Konta, winning 6-4, 6-2.

Second seed Sam Stosur began her campaign with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over American Christina McHale.

And that's out: Johanna Konta lost in straight sets to Aleksandra Wozniak

Power play: Sloane Stephens advanced

Stosur, who had a bye in the first round, took her good form from clay to grass and will next play fellow Australian Casey Dellacqua, who defeated Varvara Lepchenko 6-4, 6-3.

There were also straight-sets wins for third seed Sloane Stephens and fourth seed Kirsten Flipkens.

Stephens saw off former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-2, 6-4 while Flipkens, a surprise Wimbledon semi-finalist last year, was a 6-3, 6-2 winner over Camila Giorgi.

But fifth seed Lucie Safarova is out, the Czech losing 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 to countrywoman Barbora Zahlavova Strycova.

She will next meet lucky loser Timea Babos, who continued her run by ousting 11th seed Madison Keys 6-2,6-1.

Seeds Magdalena Rybarikova and Monica Puig also went out, the latter to 43-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm, but there were wins for Klara Koukalova, Zhang Shuai and Alison Riske.
