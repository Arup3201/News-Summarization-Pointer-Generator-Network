President Obama and his most famous golf partner Tiger Woods got together again on Tuesday, but at the White House instead of on the course.

Obama was honoring a team of American golfers who last year defeated an international team to win their fifth straight Presidents Cup, a victory that was clinched by Woods.

Hours earlier Woods, who was accompanied by girlfriend and professional skier Lindsey Vonn, had announced his return to golf after back surgery.

Woods had taken a break from golf since March 9 when persistent back pain led the champion to opt for surgery over two open competitions.

He is due to make his comeback at the Quicken Loans National, which gets underway on Thursday, before heading to the UK for the British Open next month.

'Expectations don’t change,' Woods told a press conference on Tuesday morning, as he revealed he had been working towards being ready for the Open.

'That’s the ultimate goal. It’s just that it’s going to be a little bit harder this time. I just haven’t had the amount of prep and reps that I would like. But I’m good enough to play, and I’m going to give it a go.'

The 38-year-old golfer appeared in good 
spirits when he arrived at the White House later in the day with Olympic
 Alpine skier Vonn.

As Obama stood in front of three rows of 
golfers from both teams, including Woods, Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els, who 
were all unusually dressed in suits and ties, the president said: 'I'm not used 
to seeing these guys in suits.'

'Last year was the second time I've been
 honorary chairman of the Presidents Cup. The United States won both 
times. I'm just saying,' Obama quipped during the East Room ceremony.

Vice-president Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner were also on stage with Obama, who introduced them as 'two of my favorite golf partners' though he rarely shares his foursomes with either one.

Obama said he was extraordinarily proud of the Presidents Cup team, including for its contributions to charity.

He said he hoped the team's good fortune would somehow help another sports team whose fate has transfixed America.

'We hope our World Cup team takes a page out of their playbook when they take on Germany this Thursday,' Obama said.

The
 Presidents Cup is held every two years between the U.S. and an 
international team. The 2015 tournament is scheduled for Seoul, South 
Korea.

Woods,
 who is recovering from back surgery, was in the Washington area to host
 his charitable golf tournament in Bethesda, Maryland, later this week.

Obama and Woods played golf together last year in Palm City, Florida. The president is an avid golfer who can be found on the golf course most weekends.
