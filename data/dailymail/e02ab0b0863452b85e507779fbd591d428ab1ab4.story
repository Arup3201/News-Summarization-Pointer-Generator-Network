The iconic Plaza Hotel is suing New York City and Citibank over the 'eyesore' Citi Bike racks near its entrance for causing traffic jams and attracting rubbish.

The Fifth Avenue hotel wants the row of bright blue bikes on Grand Army Plaza yanked immediately to stop further damage to its luxurious image.

'The bicycle rack is not only an eyesore, stuck squarely in between two of the city’s most famous designated landmarks, but it came at the expense of a full lane of traffic,' the suit claims.

Legal action: New York City's iconic Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park is suing the city and Citibank over the 'eyesore' blue bike racks near its entrance

The bike share stand has reduced the four-lane drive across from the hotel’s main entrance to three, causing frequent pileups and attracting litter, the lawsuit claims.

New York Post reported Plaza hotel lawyer Steven Sladkus has also argued the city violated its own laws by failing to conduct the required environmental-impact review.

He said the city made a mistake by allowing advertisements on a piece of street furniture.

'To place racks in between two of New York City’s iconic landmarks seems rather unnecessary when there are very viable other alternatives,' Sladkus said.

Furious: The Plaza is arguing these bike racks have caused traffic jams and attracted litter

Landmark: This is the iconic entrance of the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue which the hotel lawyer said it being degraded by the blue bikes

The landmark Plaza Hotel overlooks Central Park South, with views of horse-drawn carriages downstairs and close to luxury department stores.

Citibank did not provide comment.

A city Law Department said spokeswoman said, 'We are confident that the installation was proper.'

Manhattan lawyer Sladkus has represented well-heeled New Yorkers in affluent areas complaining about the popular blue bikes.

He told New York Post in June he helped block three Citi Bike stations slated for installation near luxury apartments and office buildings at 59th Street, East 55th Street and Second Avenue and Midtown West.

'I can guarantee you won’t see a Citi Bike rack in front of Mayor Bloomberg’s town house' when the program expands north of 59th Street, Sladkus said. 'Maybe the same [courtesy] should have been given to all other property owners in the city.'
