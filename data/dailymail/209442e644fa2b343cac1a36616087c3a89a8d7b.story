USC football star Josh Shaw has been suspended from college play indefinitely after admitting to school officials he fabricated a story about spraining both ankles while saving his nephew from drowning.

The newly-appointed captain of the Trojans football team said he had seen the seven-year-old struggling in a swimming pool at a family party in Palmdale, California on Saturday night, so he jumped from a second-story balcony to save him from drowning. 

The claims gained national attention on Monday, but the next day USC Coach Steve Sarkisian announced the school was investigating Shaw’s account after it received phone calls contradicting the story.

Now, Shaw is acknowledging he fabricated the drowning incident. 

He will not say how he was injured, but he did issue a brief statement this afternoon, shortly after his suspension was announced, through criminal defense attorney Donald Etra. 

'On Saturday, August 23, 2014, I injured myself in a fall. I made up a story about this fall that was untrue. I was wrong to not tell the truth. I apologize to USC for this action on my part,' said the cornerback. 

'My USC coaches, the USC Athletic Department, and especially Coach Sarkisian have all been supportive of me during my college career and for that, I am very grateful.' 

'We are extremely disappointed in Josh,' Sarkisian said in a statement.

'He let us all down. As I have said, nothing in his background led us to doubt him when he told us of his injuries, nor did anything after our initial vetting of his story.'

He later added, 'I believe Josh will learn from this. I hope that he will not be defined by this incident, and that the Trojan Family will accept his apology and support him.' 

Shaw in action against Notre Dame. He started all 13 games for the USC Trojans last season.

The Los Angeles Police Department revealed earlier this evening that Shaw’s name had been included in a report from an incident that occurred  Saturday night, where authorities responded to a woman screaming in a downtown apartment complex.

Officers interviewed several people at the building, and a woman told the police that someone had pried open a window, entered the third-floor apartment and fled, but nothing was taken. 

The woman also acknowledged 'a relationship' with Shaw, according to LAPD Lt. Andy Nieman.

Shaw, who is from Palmdale, played at Florida as a freshman before transferring to USC in 2012. He started all 13 games for the Trojans last season.

The Trojans, whose preseason rank is No. 15, open their season against Fresno State on Saturday.

Sarkisian said the Shaw situation will not be a distraction for the team this weekend.
