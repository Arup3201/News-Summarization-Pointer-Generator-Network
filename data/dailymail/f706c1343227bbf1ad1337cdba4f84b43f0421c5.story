The results of Britons' search engine activities for 2014 have been released, and it appears that when it comes to learning something from the internet, our interests range from arts and crafts to the sexiest dance of the year. 

Nervous teenagers ensure that 'how to kiss' remains high up in our favourite searches but a more unusual question being asked regularly by the British public is, 'how to twerk'.

The  move, which involves rapidly thrusting the hips while maintaining a low squatting stance, was made famous by Miley Cyrus during her performance during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and has since entered mainstream pop culture.

Twerking, Miley Cyrus's signature dance, was one of the most searched for 'how to' instructions by Brits

Twerking, demonstrated here by Miley Cyrus against fellow singer Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Award, involves rapidly thrusting the hips while maintaining a low squatting stance or bending over

According to Google's list of searches Brits are frustrated twerkers, desparate to imitate Nicki Minaj's moves

Our internet habits show that Brits are eager to perfect the move shown off by performers like Jessie J, Nicki Minaj and Beyonce.

In a list of the most googled 'how to' searches in 2014, 'twerking' comes in at sixth place while 'how to squat' is in seventh place.

The questions entered into the global search engine create a fascinating insight into UK behaviour behind closed doors.

It's further evidence that   Britain is becoming bottom obsessed.  

In August the second UK National Twerking Championships drew a large audience as 13 dancers wowed crowds with their eye-popping moves at the competition held in north London.

The women bounced and jiggled their way through five rounds in a bid to win first place and a chance to dance on stage with twerking sensation Nicki Minaj.

Ever since the Nineties there has been sharp increase in admiration of shapely bottoms.

1. Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes.

2. To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward.

3. To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone.

4. Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section.

5. For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out.

6. Then up the tempo and shake the butt.

From Kylie Minogue’s pert glutes in those gold hotpants in the 2000 Spinning Around video to Jennifer Lopez's  most famous asset, we have entered the age of the hourglass figure.

Miley Cyrus may have made brought twerking into the mainstream but Nicki Minaj just cemented it with her almost indecent Anaconda video, in which her posterior was definitely the star of the show.

Kim Kardashian's curves could be fuelling Google searches for tutorials for bum boosting squat exercises

When Kim Kardashian posted a picture on Instagram of her Paper magazine cover shoot which prominently featured her naked derriere, it received a record-breaking half a million likes in just nine hours.

2. Kiss

3. Crochet

4. Meditate

5. Knit

6. Twerk

7. Squat

8. Shuffle

9. Revise

10. Wallpaper

But alongside the increase in our preoccupation with bottoms and this headline-making dance move, Brits have also developed a growing interest in arts, crafts and DIY.

The most searched-for set of instructions of the year is 'how to draw', suggesting the UK is full of budding artists.

Following that is 'how to kiss' - for those who find asking friends how to conduct a clinch isn't quite helpful enough.

Crochet is the third most searched-for tutorial and knitting closely follows, as Brits desperately search for advice about casting on and off, tackling cable knits and other techniques.

John Lewis estimates that there are more than seven million knitters in Britain and to mark our love of the hobby a new series of The Great British Sewing Bee airs in February.

As well as our fascination with arts and crafts, DIY looms large with 'how to wallpaper' coming in tenth place on the list.
