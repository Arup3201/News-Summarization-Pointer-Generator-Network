No one knew they were expecting a new family member.

But on Thursday Ellen Pompeo, 44, announced on her WhoSay account that she and her husband Chris Ivery have gained a daughter.

'Sienna May Ivery welcome to the world,' the Grey's Anatomy actress wrote. 'We love you more than words can say.'

Along with the message, the proud parents showed a black-and-white photo of the little girl. Chris is smiling as he plants a kiss on the little one's cheek.

The baby looks to be a few weeks old but it is hard to tell as her face is mostly hidden. Her dark hair looked grown in fairly well and she was wearing a onesie.

Pompeo also tweeted, 'Sienna was born via surrogate & I would like to thank my whole @ShondalandTV family for helping us enjoy these first few weeks privately ❤️U.'

Chris and Ellen are already parents to daughter Stella, who turned  five only two weeks ago.

Ellen was last seen in public on Wednesday when she stopped by the Andy LeCompte salon in West Hollywood.

The actress looked radiant as she smiled from ear to ear. She was wearing  oversized ripped jeans and an ill-fitting button-down shirt.

A large black Givenchy purse also was held in front of her mid section.

In 2012 the Massachusetts native said she had a hard time balancing her acting career and motherhood.

'It is challenging. You know, I have my days where I feel really guilty that I've been here every day if I have to work a lot,' she said.

'But the truth is I'm in a very blessed situation, I am so lucky. First of all, I am so lucky to live in a country where a girl like me can make this kind of living, achieve her dreams and reach her goals.

'And I don't think anywhere else in the world can girls have the freedom that we do here to have these amazing careers and be mothers.

She added, 'So first I'll say it really isn't a challenge with respect to the women in the rest of the world, I think we're very lucky.

' And all working moms have their challenges and I'm incredibly lucky compared to most. I can afford help and I'm fortunate where I can bring her here if I miss her.'

The Old School star also said that she feels her life is a 'blessing.'

'I've got my little challenges, but they're insignificant compared to what real working moms go through,' Pompeo admitted.
