George Zimmerman's mother-in-law today filed a police report claiming he stole furniture and a television set from her house when she ordered him to leave.

Shellie Zimmerman's mother, Machelle Dean, owns the house in Lake Mary, Florida where George and Shellie were living during his murder trial before they broke up. It was also the scene of the Zimmermans' domestic dispute earlier this month.

In the latest twist in the Zimmerman saga, Mrs Dean now claims he left with her belongings when she ordered him to vacate the property by yesterday, TMZ reported.

Scene: Shellie Zimmerman's parents called police to their house in Lake Mary, Florida on Thursday, claiming that they had had items stolen. George Zimmerman is the home's tenant, police said

When police responded to the scene, 
they said there was no sign of a break in and reportedly characterized 
it as a landlord-tenant dispute between Zimmerman and his in-laws.

Officer Zach Hudson added that other people may also have been staying in the house and told the Orlando Sentinel.

The home is the same place Lake Mary police were called out to earlier in September after an altercation broke out between George and Shellie.

In a 911 call from that incident, Shellie alleged that George punched her father in the face.

Shellie also accused her estranged husband of grabbing her iPad, throwing it to the ground and breaking it, but no one pressed charges after that incident.

Shellie's parents also own a home 
across the street. No one answered at either home when Local 6 knocked 
on the front door Thursday night.

Spat: George Zimmerman, who lives at the house, is going through a divorce with his wife, Shellie. They are pictured in court at his murder trial before he was acquitted of murder in July

Speaking out: Appearing on the Today show on Thursday, Shellie Zimmerman said that the battle with her husband rages on but that she has been unable to serve him divorce papers

The
theft report - the latest twist in the Zimmerman saga - came on the 
same day that Shellie Zimmerman appeared on the Today show to say that 
her estranged husband treated her as if she was 'disposable'.

She filed for divorce from him three weeks ago but has been unable to serve him the divorce papers because she does not know where he is, she said.

The interview on Thursday was first since a domestic dispute between the couple at the Lake Mary home earlier this month.

She had called police to report that 
her estranged husband had threatened to shoot her and her father after 
punching him and smashing her iPad.

But Zimmerman disputed the claims, 
instead blaming Shellie for starting the argument and hitting him with 
the iPad. Police responded to the scene but neither side pressed 
charges.

She told the 
Today show she was standing by her story that he had a gun during the 
altercation in Lake Mary, Florida two weeks ago because of how he 
touched his shirt - even though she never actually saw a firearm and 
police said they did not find one.

Dispute: Shellie is pictured entering the home before the domestic dispute two weeks ago. She claimed that Zimmerman threatened to shoot her and smashed her iPad and punched her father

Caught: He is pictured as he was detained by police after she called 911 on him. He was soon released

On Friday, Lake Mary police told Local 6 that they will attempt to extract video from the iPad that was shattered in the domestic dispute - despite previously expressing their doubt they would try.

Pieces have been sent to a forensics lab to try to get the video Shellie took of the fight.

But the device was seriously damaged in the fight and police said there is only a five per cent chance they'll be able to retrieve the video.

In the Today interview, Shellie added that she no longer feels like she can trust her husband or his version of events in the Trayvon Martin shooting after how he has treated her.

'I'm conflicted,' she said. 'I believe the evidence but this revelation in my life has helped me take the blinders off. I think anyone would doubt that innocence because I don't know the person I've been married to.'
