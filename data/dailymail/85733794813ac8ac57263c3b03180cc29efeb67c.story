David Cameron has told fellow Nato leaders not to pay ransoms for hostages as it only increases kidnappings and funds further terrorism.

The Prime Minister used the military alliance's two-day summit in Wales to hit out at countries who hand over multi-million pound sums to Islamist jihadis.

His warning came as a Syrian translator for the charity employing British hostage David Haines described the moment when ISIS fighters sprang from two cars to kidnap the Briton last year.

Speaking at the Nato summit in Wales, David Cameron today hit out at countries who pay multi-million pound ransoms to Islamic militants, insisting the payments only fund more terror

The UK has a policy of not paying ransoms to terrorists, but France and Italy are believed to have handed over large amounts to the groups for the release of their nationals 

Mr Cameron used an address at the lavish official dinner in Cardiff Castle to remind fellow leaders of commitments signed up to at last year's G8 summit not to pay ransoms to terror groups.

While the UK Government has always said it will not pay ransoms for British nationals, hostages from other countries - such as France and Italy - have been released after large sums were reportedly paid out.

Speaking ahead of the dinner, Mr Cameron described such payments as 'deeply regrettable' and warned: 'It is utterly self-defeating. It is worse than self-defeating, it is actually a risk to us back at home.

'All those people who signed these declarations know that what matters is not your signature on a declaration but not letting money be paid to terrorist kidnappers because that money goes into arms, it goes into weapons, it goes into terror plots, it goes into more kidnaps.'

His comments came as an eyewitness told how British aid worker David Haines - and Italian colleague Federico Motka, who was released in May - were kidnapped by 'professional' gunmen who targeted his vehicle to take Western hostages.

The unnamed translator said his group were driving back to Turkey via Aleppo from the nearby Atmeh refugee camp when the gunmen appeared.

The man told the Independent: 'Two very fast cars came up behind – one overtook and the other stayed behind. They shouted at us to get out of the car in formal Arabic. They were wearing black masks and were so professional.

'They knew that two of us were Syrians and they knew who else was in the car. One of them put a gun to my head and threatened me not to tell anyone what I had seen.

'They put [Mr Haines and Mr Motka] in the boot of their car and shot out the tyres of our car.'

The translator said the kidnapping took place 'in seconds' and the gunmen included at least one foreigner who appeared to be of African origin.

He added: 'No-one thought that would happen so close to the border. All of us were just looking forward to getting back to Turkey.'

The translator praised Mr Haines for his warmth and humanity towards the Syrian refugees. He said: 'I remember he was really worried for the people [in one camp] because they didn't have toilets. He stopped by every child though and made a joke with them.

'He was always smiling and listening to the refugees. Those three days, I was with the best guy in aid work.'

The Prime Minister is to personally brief a member of the Haines family on the latest developments in a case that has caused outrage around the world.

On Tuesday, the 44-year-old Briton was shown kneeling in the sand wearing an orange jumpsuit on a video of the beheading of a US hostage. Military commanders have been asked to draw up plans for a special forces rescue.

The Prime Minister, who is coming under growing pressure to unleash a military response, said Britain would use 'everything we have in our armoury' to squeeze the terror group out of existence, and repeatedly refused to rule out joining the US in air strikes - even leaving the door open to attacking ISIS in Syria without the approval of President Bashar Assad.

But he appeared to indicate that such action was not imminent, stressing that his immediate priority was offering support to legitimate regional forces already confronting ISIS on the ground, such as the Iraqi government in Baghdad and the Kurdish authorities in the north of the country.

'I think sometimes people think that there is no strategy unless it simply consists of air strikes,' said Mr Cameron.

'That is not the case. What it needs is a fully-formed strategy to squeeze this from every angle. That is what you are getting from this conference.'

Government sources said that, in a one-to-one meeting with US president Barack Obama, the two leaders discussed 'broad strategy' for dealing with the terrorist threat, rather than specific action.

Mr Cameron said ministers were now 'actively' considering whether to supply arms to the Kurdish peshmerga militias fighting ISIS in northern Iraq or to provide them with military training.

Lieutenant General Sir Simon Mayall, the Government's senior defence adviser in the Middle East, has been in discussions with leaders of the Kurdish administration in Irbil about how best the UK could assist.

So far Britain has supplied only non-lethal equipment - such as helmets and body armour - although RAF transport planes have flown in ammunition supplied from Albania for the Kurds' Soviet-era weaponry.

Leader of the Commons William Hague has told MPs that ministers will seek Parliament's support for any British air strikes against Islamic extremists if 'there is time to do so', though he added that the Government is not proposing military action 'at the moment'.

Asked whether the UK could join with the US in air strikes, Mr Cameron told ITV1's Good Morning Britain (GMB): 'I'm certainly not ruling anything out and I will always act in the British national interest.'

He added: 'We need to show real resolve and determination, we need to use every power and everything in our armoury with our allies, with those on the ground, to make sure we do everything we can to squeeze this dreadful organisation out of existence.'

He also stressed the urgent need for the establishment of an inclusive and stable government in Baghdad, which Iraqi prime minister-designate Haider Abadi has said he hopes to form by around September 11.
