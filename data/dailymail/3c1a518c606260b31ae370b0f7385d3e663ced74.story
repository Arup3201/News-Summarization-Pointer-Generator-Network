When Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Jourdan Dunn stomped down the Burberry catwalk in THOSE blanket coats - a new AW14 style staple was born.

The wool blanket 
ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned with Apache-style zig 
zags were monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it.

Designer Christopher Bailey, known for setting trends, explained that Burberry has a long history of capes and blankets and the Burberry Heritage archive revealed that outerwear capes dated all the way back to the late 1880s.

It's the blanket brigade! Cara Delevingne leads the finale at Burberry's AW14 show, which proved that the blanket will be the coolest way to wrap up warm this winter

'The designs were created for activities including shooting, motoring and cycling, and proved popular due to their warmth, protective qualities and ease of wear.

'An illustration for a cotton gabardine cape also featured in Thomas Burberry’s patent application for the lightweight, weatherproof cloth in 1888,' he said. 

'The Burberry Heritage archive presents advertisements for scarves as early as the 1880s in the local Hants & Berks Gazette.

'Now, the iconic cashmere scarf, which lands in store on September 2 and can be personalised with initials, is at the heart of our brand, recognised globally and is one of our most popular products over the AW14 period.'

Too hot to wear it? No problem! Just throw it over your shoulder a la Burberry's models who brought back the trend from the Burberry Heritage archives, which have evidence of outerwear capes dating back to the late 1880s

And it wasn't just Bailey who sent blanket coats down the catwalk - Chloe, Prabal Gurung, Sacai and DKNY's models all wrapped up warm in theirs on the runway, too.

The new poncho styles seemingly take inspiration from the traditional equestrian blanket, with blanket-stitched edging and a warm and hardwearing textured feel.

Vogue's catwalk edit describes them as the new 'wrap stars', with Helen Hibbird advising: 'Exquisite fabrics take this trend from sofa to street; look for double-faced cashmere and silk blends for the perfect drape.'

The high street is slowly but surely catching on and as the AW14 collections drop in store, the likes of Zara, Asos, Topshop and Net-a-porter are all offering their own cosy versions.

Lisa Haynes, fashion and beauty editor of the Press Association, mused: 'When I saw Cara and co. storming the Burberry Prorsum AW14 catwalk, I had instant bespoke blanket envy. The monogramming, showcased by CD (Cara Delevingne) and SW (Suki Waterhouse), gives the piece massive trophy appeal.

'If you can't afford the £895 Burberry price tag, look to the high street for a blanket poncho homage.

'AW14's 'blankoat' blanket/coat fusion is surprisingly handy for transitioning between the seasons.

'Wear instead of an overcoat as a layering staple. If you're wearing a blanket in Burberry's proportions, keep the rest of your outfit streamlined to balance out your silhouette.

'A step on from last winter's shoulder robing, work it like a Burberry model by draping your blankoat over one shoulder. If the asymmetry feels off make like Olivia P and wear around your neck, like a super-sized scarf.

'Any old blanket from the duvet cupboard just won’t do. Your new season blankoat needs to be colour-blocked, textured and luxe - initials optional.'

Will you be wrapping up warm this winter? ASOS are offering cosy blankets for £35, left, while designers are such as Michael Kors, right, are jumping on the cosy bandwagon with this £250 plaid offering from Net-a-Porter
