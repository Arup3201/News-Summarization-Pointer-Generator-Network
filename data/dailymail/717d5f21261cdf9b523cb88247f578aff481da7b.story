Louisa Manning, 22, asked a waiter to give her 'date' an old photo and letter. The note detailed jibes the bully made at school about her weight and mono-brow

For one Oxford University student, revenge was a dish best served cold.

After nearly ten years of waiting, Louisa Manning last week got her own back on the bully who called her ‘manbeast’ as a teenager.

The 22-year-old had been reunited with her former classmate at a university Christmas ball.

She had undergone a stunning transformation in the intervening years – so much so that the young man apparently didn’t recognise her and asked her out to dinner.

But Miss Manning – who was picked on at school because of her weight and appearance – did not show up. Instead, she asked a waiter to hand the man a photograph of her younger self accompanied by a note.

The letter, which she later posted online, read: ‘Hey, so sorry I can’t join you tonight.

‘Remember year 8, when I was fat and you made fun of my weight? No? I do – I spent the following three years eating less than an apple a day. So I’ve decided to skip dinner.

‘Remember the monobrow you mocked? The hairy legs you were disgusted by? Remember how every day for three years, you and your friends called me manbeast?’

She added that he probably didn’t – or he wouldn’t have deemed her attractive enough to treat her ‘like a human being’. ‘I thought I’d send you this as a reminder,’ she said.

‘Next time you think of me, picture this photo, because she’s the one who just stood you up.’

Last night the post had already received more than 17,000 ‘Likes’ on the social networking site Facebook.

One user commented: ‘You are a heroine. Thank you for standing up against bullying, the world needs more role models like you.’

Another wrote: ‘Nice work, you’re awesome. I was never a big bully but was someone who gave some kids some **** back in grade school.... I have since approached them to apologise for my behaviour back then. So don’t totally swear this guy off.. cheers!’

Twitter user Andrew Kay wrote to Miss Manning: ‘On behalf of everyone who has ever been bullied, well done for standing up and taking charge’.

St Peter’s College student Miss Manning, who is from Cambridgeshire, later received a reply on Facebook from the man she stood up.

It said: ‘Hey… For what it’s worth, I was actually here looking for a chance to meet up to make friends, not because you are very good looking.

‘I guess I had it coming though, and certainly don’t blame you for standing me up.

The letter Louisa Manning wrote to a former bully who asked her out on a date, along with a picture of her as a school child

‘I can’t change who I was 8 years ago, and I won’t insult your intelligence by pretending it didn’t happen, but I hope you believe me when I say I’m a different person now.

‘I can only apologise and wish you the very best. I guess I won’t hear from you again but I mean it when I say I hope you have every success you deserve.’

Speaking after the story spread around the world, Miss Manning said: ‘I think it’s crazy and quite overwhelming, I wasn’t expecting it to go this viral.

‘I think every tabloid ever has now printed something on me. I was pretty happy with Glamour 

magazine though – I was listed hero of the week, alongside Prince Harry. Success.’
