Britain has a proud heritage in winning Olympic gold medals in the heptathlon and Katarina Johnson-Thompson hopes she can one day join the roll of honour.

At the age of 21, she's already achieved gold medals at junior championships, the World indoors and has a British long jump record. 

But now her sights are firming set on Rio 2016, where she's keen to emulate the success of Jessica Ennis-Hill, who took gold at the London 2012 Olympics.

Due to their shared talent over seven athletic events, Katarina is often compared to the Sheffield Olympian.

But she told MailOnline she isn't fazed by the comparisons.

'Being compared to Jess Ennis-Hill is a big deal because she's an Olympic gold medallist and British record holder. Being compared to her is a huge compliment because she's such a good athlete,' she said.

'I don't feel any pressure because as an athlete you want to go out there and win medals, especially Olympic medals. That's my goal anyway so there's no pressure because she had already done it.'

As Jessica plans to make a comeback after having a baby this year, Katarina would have to beat the champion in order to realise her own Olympic dream in 2016.

She said going to Rio has been a life-long target, and her desire to compete there has been heighten after she missed out on this summer's Commonwealth Games and European Championships due to a foot injury, from which she is still recovering. 

Sidelined: She won a silver in the long jump at this year's World Indoor Games but missed the Commonwealths and European Champs due to injury

Chance to shine: Sainsbury's School Games is a major multi-sport event for some of the most talented young athletes across the UK

'It was really hard for me to miss out. No athlete wants to be injured at the peak of the summer. It was very hard for me to sit back and watch, especially as I knew I was in such good shape,' she admitted.

But rather than wonder that might have been, she is looking to the future and hopes to win a medal at next year's World Championships in Beijing.

The Liverpudlian first got into athletics by joining her local running club - Liverpool Harriers - as child and she recommends other people do the same to get fit, whatever their age.  

She said: 'At my club there are kids to older people who just go along to keep fit. It doesn't cost that much to join and running with other people will help you get through it. I find doing my winter training with a group helps me get fit as you are going through the pain together.'

Mentor: Katarina watches on as youngsters take part in the high jump and long jump

As a youngster, Katarina honed her talent competing in the Sainsbury's School Games, where she won the high jump gold in 2008.

The games, which are supported by National Lottery funding from Sport England and delivered by the Youth Sport Trust, are a major multi-sport event for some of the most talented young athletes across the UK.

Replicating an international championship, 1,600 athletes compete in 12 sports in venues across Manchester and experience a spectacular opening and closing ceremony, an athletes’ village, and a targeted education programme which includes anti-doping advice and guidance.

Katarina hasn't forgotten her roots and is supporting this year's event, held this weekend, to inspire young stars of the future who are hoping to emulate her success.

She said she's honoured to be seen as a role model to them.

'Girls say to me that they look up to me because I have done stuff at a young age, I try to take it in my stride,' she said. 

'I watched reality TV shows growing up but I think sports stars make better role models because they show hard works pays off - they achieve their goals because they have worked for them.'
