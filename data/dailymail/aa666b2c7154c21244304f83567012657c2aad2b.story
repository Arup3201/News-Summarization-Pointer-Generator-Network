Victoria Beckham has been listed as Britain's most successful entrepreneur 

She rose to fame as Posh Spice and was recently named a goodwill ambassador by the United Nations.

Now Victoria Beckham has a new title to add to her growing list of accolades – Britain’s most successful entrepreneur.

The 40-year-old singer turned fashion designer was yesterday named top of a list of the country’s 100 business people, beating Sir James Dyson and Dame Vivienne Westwood.

It comes after the turnover of Mrs Beckham’s fashion business has risen from £1million to £30million in just five years.

Last month, the mother of four opened her first stand alone boutique in London’s Mayfair. Just five years ago, she had three employees on her books. She now has 100.

The title was awarded to the former pop star by Management Today after the business magazine ranked scores of entrepreneurs by their success over the past five years.

In 2012, Mrs Beckham, said in an interview that she was called posh because she ‘liked the nice restaurants, and the nice clothes’. And now she can certainly afford both. Since 2009, her turnover has increased by 2,900 per cent.

Her current wealth is estimated at £210million – overtaking her husband David, who was worth a reported £165million in 2013. 

 Andrew Saunders of Management Today told The Daily Telegraph: ‘She’s got a real business, some design talent and some business nous. She gets a lot of stick for being a celeb fashionista but I don’t think that’s fair.

‘She has built something real out of her own celebrity which is quite a contemporary story. She deserves to be celebrated.’

The former pop-star's fashion label has grown by more than £20million in just five years, with a flagship store launching in London just last motnh

Individually, Mrs Beckham is now worth more than her football icon husband, David. The couple are pictured with their three sons, Cruz, Romeo and Brooklyn. They also have a daughter, Harper 

Mrs Beckham launched her fashion label in 2008. Her designs have been worn by stars across Hollywood from Gwyneth Paltrow to Kate Winslet.

Last month, singer Ellie Goulding was pictured coming out of Mrs Beckham’s boutique, where prices begin at £150 for a keyring.

 Instead of tills, customers pay using an iPad. At the launch of the shop in September, Mrs Beckham said: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere’.

After being made a goodwill ambassador for the UN last month, she said: ‘It’s taken me to get to 40 to realise I have a responsibility as a woman and as a mother.’
