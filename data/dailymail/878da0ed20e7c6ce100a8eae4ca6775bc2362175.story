This artist enjoys a trip down memory line - drawing some of the world's most famous cities from memory.

Stefan Bleekrode, 28, uses his memory to sketch cities such as New York, London and Paris after he has visited them.

The artist, from Eindhoven, Netherlands, draws in such detail people find it hard to believe he wasn't in each city while drawing or copying a picture.

Impressive: Mr Bleerode brilliantly recreates the majesty of the Manhattan skyline

Remarkable: Bleekrode has trained his mind to pick up certain details in a given location. This drawing is of Washington Square in New York

Art of the matter: This is a Mr Bleekrode did of London's famed Shard tower by the River Thames

The series, called Cityscapes, stemmed from impressionist drawings of places in France and Belgium which he started experimenting with aged 10.

Since then he has trained his mind to pick up certain details in a given location and sometimes jots down notes about specific points.

The smallest canvas he uses can take up to five days to complete.

Labour-intensive: The smallest canvas that Mr Bleekrode draws on can take up to five days to complete

Detailed: This is an intricate drawing of Bern in Switzerland, complete with the mountainscape in the background

Skyscraper's the limit: Mr Bleekrode is able to recall hundreds of buildings from memory

Illuminating: This is Mr Bleekrode's drawing of New York at night. His large canvasses sell for £3,800

Escapism: Mr Bleekrode said that he produces the drawings so he could 'drift back to those... inspiring places'

Imagination: Some of Mr Bleekrode's drawings are invented, such as Metropolis By The Sea (pictured)

This bustling urban scene is called City By The Med and shows off Mr Bleekrode's amazing ability to pencil-in fine detail

The pictures are mostly of real cities, with a small number being city scenes that he's invented. 

Large-scale drawings take Stefan up to half a year to complete and sell for between $1,800 (£1,150) and $6,000 (£3,800).

Mr Bleekrode said: 'At the age of 10 I wanted to recapture my impressions of places in France and Belgium I'd visited during a holiday the previous summer.

'Where I live there's very little that pleases the eye - just 1960's housing estates and offices.

'By doing these small pencil drawings I could drift back to those sunny and inspiring places where the world was colourful and eager to be explored.

'I continue to do the Cityscape drawings for as long as I enjoy it or until I run out of ideas.'

New York has been a huge inspiration for Mr Bleekrode. Pictured is a drawing he produced called Central Park Sunset

Mr Bleekrode said that he likes drawing epic city scenes partly because he finds the architecture where he lives uninspiring. This drawing is called Spacca Napoli
