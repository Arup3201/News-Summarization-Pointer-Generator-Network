Royal etiquette may dictate that the Duchess of Cambridge must behave like a lady, but there's one thing that really makes Kate let her glossy hair down - watching sport.

And nowhere has this been better demonstrated than at this year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Kate just couldn't suppress those 'ooohs' and 'ahhhs' as she watched the athletics from the stands at Hampden Park today.

A sporting girl herself, Kate clearly feels rather involved, even as a spectator. Yesterday, it was the hockey - at which she excelled as a schoolgirl - that elicited her cheers.

On the schedule today were
English triple-jumper Greg Rutherford, Scottish hurdler Eilidh Child and
 Kenyan runner David Rudisha compete.

She whooped the wins, punched the air with disappointment at the losses and laughed along with the crowd.

At 
one point the Duchess of Cambridge was poised, thumbs in limbo, waiting 
to see which way the action would go before giving a big thumbs up to 
the win.

At another particularly tense moment, she could be seen biting her lip with nerves.

And
 Prince William looked equally enthralled, chatting 
along with his wife and getting involved in the spectator action.

Oooh-errr!: The Royals are entranced by the action

The pair were in Glasgow for the sixth day of action, watching the seven track and field events unfold. 

Yesterday, the Royals were also in attendance, to watch the hockey.

The Duchess looked simple and elegant in her trusty wedges, blue skin tight trousers and classic blue blazer.

Pictured with their faces in all manner of contortions they seemed to live and breathe the match from the sidelines.

At one particularly hair-raising moment, the princess put her hand over her mouth and then covered her eyes.

Prince Edward, who sat beside the couple, was equally enthralled by the action.

Oh no! The Royals can't hide their amazement at the hockey action

Kate also made an appearance at Wimbledon earlier this month. The royal 
couple watched Federer and 
Djokovic battle it out in the final.

The face said it all as the gripping match unfolded.

They sat in the Royal Box with David and Victoria Beckham, as
 well as a host of Hollywood stars including Bradley Cooper, Samuel L 
Jackson, Hugh Jackman and Orlando Bloom.

Lip-biting stuff: Kate watches Andy Murray crash out of Wimbledon

The face says it all: Kate finds it hard to hide the tension she's feeling while watching the British champ

Looking optimistic, but defeat is in store for their boy Murray

Earlier in the week, the Royals 
popped into SW19 to watch Andy Murry, but the British champ ended up 
losing to Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria.

The duchess was so involved in the match, at one point her mouth become totally contorted.

But the 32-year-old still managed to look chic wearing a dress by Australian designer, Zimmerman.

The tension was palpable as Kate cheered on the Wimbledon finalists
