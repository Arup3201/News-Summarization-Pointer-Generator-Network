The woman who created the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress has been named Designer of the Year by an influential style magazine.

The Harper's Bazaar award for Sarah Burton comes after the DuchessÂ  herself was named 'Britain's queen of style' as she topped the magazine's Best Dressed list.

Miss Burton, 37, creative director of fashion brand Alexander McQueen, clinched the coveted award at the fashion magazine's Women of the Year Awards at Claridge's Hotel in London last night.

Year to remember: Designer Sarah Burton's award came seven months after the dress she created for the Duchess of Cambridge was seen across the globe at the Royal Wedding

Designer Sarah Burton managed to keep her involvement with the creation of Kate's ivory lace and silk dress a secret from her closest friends and family

The dress which Kate Middleton wore for her wedding to Prince William in April cemented her place as a fashion icon, while also making Miss Burton the most in-demand designer of the moment.

The wedding and bridesmaid dress designs have both since been replicated by high street stores, with Debenhams launching its own 'Pippa Middleton-style' gown last week.

Miss Burton revealed last week that the Duchess's wedding dress was such a closely guarded secret even her parents were unaware she was working on it.

The Alexander McQueen creative director was so keen to disguise her involvement with the creation of the dress that she informed no one but a small group of colleagues who would work with her on the design.

At the awards ceremony, Dame Judi Dench received a Lifetime Achievement award while fashion designer and Oscar-nominated film director Tom Ford received the award for a Man in a Woman's World.

Other winners included supermodels Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen, Eva Herzigova, Yasmin Le Bon and Cindy Crawford who were collectively named Fashion Icons of the Year.
