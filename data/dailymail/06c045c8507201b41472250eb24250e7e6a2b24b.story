Found dead: Keith Currie, former treasurer of Northern Rock, died on 
Sunday

The former treasurer of Northern Rock has been found dead at his home after it is believed he spiralled into depression over his role in the bank’s collapse.

Keith Currie, 56, stepped down just two months after the bank went bust in 2007 and later retired with a reported £2.5million payout.

Friends say he was haunted by the bank’s collapse and could not forgive himself for failing to ensure the business had enough financing to survive.

It is believed he became a recluse and began drinking.

He also suffered a marriage collapse earlier this year.

Police today confirmed the father-of-one had been found dead at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle, at around 3pm on Sunday.

A close friend, who asked not to be named, said Mr Currie felt 'terrible' about ordinary people losing their money.

He said: 'He was a very charitable chap. He was just a really nice, very happy-go-lucky sort of guy.

'When Northern Rock went down he became quite reclusive. He did not go out. He was a guy with a conscience.

'He felt terrible about customers and shareholders losing their money.'

The friend added: 'He started to fall into depression'.

Mr Currie was appointed treasury manager of Northern Rock in January 
2005 and played a key role in ensuring the bank had enough financing.

But just a month after Northern Rock crashed in September 2007 Mr 
Currie was notably absent from work for two weeks, citing stress.

He stepped down as a board director in November 2007 and took early 
retirement in January 2008 - after pocketing a reported £2.5million in bonus 
pay-outs.

Northern Rock’s shares collapsed after it was forced to seek emergency funding from the Bank of England.

Concerned customers rushed to withdraw their money and the share price plunged 30 per cent.

Mr Currie was criticised along with other executives for selling 
shares in the bank months before its financial crisis.

A 2009 Channel 4 Dispatches investigation into banking chiefs’ bonuses found Mr Currie had received payments totalling £2.5million.

The friend added; 'He had everything going for him. He was a nice bloke, with a good sense of humour.' 

'From what I understand one of his friends was trying to get hold of him and that is when they realised something was wrong,' they added.

A spokesman for Northumbria Police yesterday said: 'At 3.12pm Northumbria Police received a report from the ambulance service of a man found dead at his house on Lindisfarne Road in Jesmond.

'The man was in his 50s. The coroner has been informed.'

A post mortem is expected to take place on Wednesday.

Mr Currie is understood to have broken up from his wife Fiona Currie, 52, earlier this year after ten years of marriage.

He is known to have previously been married and has one son, Angus, 19. A spokesman for Virgin Money today said: 'We are very sad to hear the news of Keith's passing.'

Northern Rock was caught up in the US sub-prime lending crisis and was forced to apply to the Bank of England for emergency financial support in September 2007.

Worried savers queued up around the bank's 76 branches to withdraw savings - totalling up to £2.5billion - causing the share price to plunge by 30 per cent.

On September 17, 2007, the then Chancellor Alistair Darling stepped in and guaranteed all Northern Rock deposits in a bid to restore confidence in the bank.

Northern Rock executives appeared before a Parliamentary committee into the crisis October 16, 2007, and three days later chairman Matt Ridley resigned.

On November 17, 2007, the chief executive Adam Applegarth resigned along with board directors David Baker, Keith Currie and Andy Kuipers who stood down but remained as officers.

The Chancellor announced on February 17, 2008, that Northern Rock would be taken into public ownership.

The bank was later split in two with the 'good' bank being sold to Virgin Money for £747million on November 17, 2011.

It is estimated the sale saw taxpayers with a 'paper' loss of between £400million and ££650million.
