Poor proposal: Richard Curtis revealed that he 'might' propose to long-term partner Emma Freud during an interview - which she then read in the newspaper

He has penned some of the most memorable and endearingly awkward love scenes in romantic comedy.

So you might think that when it came to proposing to his own girlfriend, scriptwriter Richard Curtis would know how to avoid pitfalls.

Unfortunately, though, the 57-year-old creator of Love Actually and Notting Hill has botched his attempt at a proposal to Emma Freud in toe-curlingly bumbling fashion.

When asked in a radio interview about marrying Miss Freud, his partner of 22 years, Curtis blurted out: ‘I think I might.’

Miss Freud, 52, was less than impressed when she read about his comment in a newspaper on Saturday, the day before it was broadcast.

She jokingly called it ‘my worst ever marriage proposal’.

Miss Freud tweeted: ‘Whaaaat? First I’ve heard about it. Is this what you call a proposal? In the telegraph??? #notsoromanticafterall’

Later the broadcaster added: ‘Just for the record I am not getting married. He would have to ask me in person. Or at least on Twitter.’

Curtis, whose other rom-com hits  include Four Weddings And A Funeral and Bridget Jones’s Diary, made his gaffe during a recording of Radio 4’s The Reunion.

He told the programme’s host Sue MacGregor that he had written Four Weddings ‘as an attempt to explain to my mother why I wasn’t getting married’. 

Where's the romance? Miss Freud, pictured with Curtis in 2008, said she would only accept a proposal made in person - or 'at least on Twitter'

He added: ‘I have to say it didn’t work. She was still very unhappy with the situation for the next 15 years, although, do you know, I’m thinking about it. I think I might.’

Curtis has previously said that he and Miss Freud, who have four children, became an item after they kept meeting at weddings – another source of inspiration for the low-budget 1994 film.

Four Weddings, starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, went on to become one of the most successful British films ever.
