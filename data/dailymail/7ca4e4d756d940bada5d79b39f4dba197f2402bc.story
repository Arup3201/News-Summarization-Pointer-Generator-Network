The teenage daughter of one of Australia's richest men has successfully challenged her father's will in court after claiming she is entitled to a $2.5 million house, a $100,000 wedding, a diamond encrusted grand piano and two cars.

Olivia Jacqueline Mead, 19, won a claim to $25 million dollars, an increase from the $3 million trust fund originally left to her when her iron ore magnate father Michael Wright died in 2012.

Ms Mead claimed that the amount left to her from her father's estimated worth of $1 billion was insufficient and would not be able to provide her with advancement in life, reported Nine News.

The 19-year-old told the Western Australian Supreme Court that she needed a home five times the Perth median price ($2.5 million), $10,000 each year for fashion accessories including Tiffany and Co sunglasses and $100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot.

Her list of claims also included an Audi A4 and a Toyota Tarago for when she has children, as well as a diamond-encrusted bass guitar worth $250,000 and a limited ­edition Kuhn Bosendorfer grand piano. 

In a summons filed in December 2012, Ms Mead also claimed to have been left without adequate funds for her proper maintenance, support, education and advancement in life from her father's estate in the bequeath to be held in trust until she was 30.

On Thursday, Master Craig Sanderson of the Western Australian Supreme Court agreed, saying Mr Wright did not make adequate provision for his youngest child from his 'colossal' estate.

'The deceased had a vast fortune and he was in the fortunate position of being able to provide for all of the parties who had a claim on his bounty,' Master Sanderson said.

While the 19-year-old had been included in the trust, the structure meant that Ms Mead might have received very little as the will stated that she could receive 'up to' $3 million. 

The judge also found that the will had been worded in an 'unwieldy' way, and that her fate was in the hands of the executor of the will, David Lemon, whom Ms Mead had never met, and whom had close ties with other family members.

Master Sanderson found the situation 'unreasonable', and said that the will 'could operate in an entirely oppressive fashion', potentially excluding her as a beneficiary if she was convicted of a drink driving offence.

Ms Mead was suing her two half-sisters who had already been awarded $400 million of their father's estate

'It may even be the case if she was suspected of involvement with someone who used an illicit substance she could be excluded,' he said.

One of the clauses of the will stated that  if the plaintiff converted to Buddhism, or perhaps Islam - or even was associated with someone who practised those faiths - she would be an 'excluded person'.

Master Sanderson found the clause 'an extraordinary proposition' and that she would have to give up her Australian birthright of freedom of religion. 

Master Sanderson said the $25 million should be paid to Ms Mead in a lump sum.

The rest of the estate will pass to Ms Mead's half-sisters, Leonie Baldock and Alexandra Burt, who will get about $10 million each minus about $1 million for legal costs.

Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon. The matter was heard in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on Monday

'That is on top of the $400 million they already have and they can rest easy in the knowledge their half-sister will be financially secure for the rest of her life,' he said. 

Mr Wright was estimated to be worth $1.5 billion when he died at 74 and was the son of Peter Wright, who co-founded Hancock Prospecting and Wright Prospecting with Lang Hancock - Gina Rinehart's father.

The late mining heir was married four times and fathered three children, two of whom are involved in the Western ­Australia family business.

Ms Mead is now suing her father's other two children  - Leonie Baldock and ­Alexandra Burt - and the executor of her father's will, David Lemon. 

Ms Mead claimed in court she will need $300 a week for utilities, $800 a week for food and alcohol, $150 a week for fine wine and $300 a week for clothing.

The university student, who appeared in court on Monday, said her relationship with her father was 'sporadic'.

The defendants in the matter are executor David  Lemon, Leonie Angela Maynard Baldock, Alexandra Odette Burt and VOC Group Ltd.

Ms Baldock, who is also Mr Wright's daughter, took over the reins at Wright Prospecting shortly after he died when she was aged 40.

The VOC Group is related to the Voyager Estate winery in Margaret River bought by Mr Wright - who was reportedly not a drinker - in 1991.
