With the benefit of hindsight it was probably not a wise decision for this laden tow truck to venture onto the thin ice.

Having been called out to rescue a hapless motorist who had plunged into a frozen lake surface, the salvage crew fell victim to the same fate.

The bungling mechanics found themselves needing rescue after driving on to the treacherous water at Xining in Qinghai province in the northwest of China.

The comedy of errors began when a local sports club decided to stage a party on the lake.

Visitor Kuan-Yin Ma, 38, wanted to get into the swing of festivities and decided to liven up the event by taking his car for a spin across the ice.

But he and his friends were forced to leap out quickly when they ice in front of the car cracked sending the front-end sinking into the frozen lake but then wedging on the rim of the ice.

Eyewitness Lee Shen said: 'He was lucky it didn't sink immediately but stuck on the rim of the unbroken ice allowing him and his pals to jump out.

Danger: Visitor Kuan-Yin Ma, 38, decided to take his car for a spin across the lake - not realising how thin the ice was in parts

'People on the shore went to help by using heavy wooden poles to try and leave the car back out but that was really foolish because it levered it off the edge - where it sank into the ice hole.'

A rescue truck that was on the scene then tried to help.

But acting on bad advice that it was quite safe the truck also drove onto the ice, where it then fell through and also became stuck leaving both vehicles stranded.

After the ice then froze around both vehicles it was decided to wait until it thaws sometime after the spring Festival when they hope to be able to remove both vehicles.
