The adopted son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was released from prison yesterday morning - four months after he was sentenced for violent disorder during the tuition fee protests.

Charlie Gilmour, 21, walked out of HMP Wayland in Norfolk into the autumn sunshine with what appears to be a cigarette tucked behind his right ear before stepping into a chauffeur-driven Mercedes in which his father was sitting.

The close crop of the rioter's hair was in marked contrast to the lengthy locks he sported when he swung from a Union flag on the Cenotaph during demonstrations in London last December.

Gilmour was jailed after admitting violent disorder during the riots in London while high on LSD, Valium and whisky

He was jailed for 16 months in July after a judge said he had shown the 'ultimate disrespect' to Britain's war dead.

His solicitor, Robert Brown, said: 'Charlie Gilmour was released from HMP
Wayland subject to him complying with a home detention curfew (HDC - 
commonly known as tagging).

'The curfew will continue until the 
halfway point of his 16-month sentence. This is standard procedure for 
prisoners who are serving a sentence of between three months and four 
years.

'Charlie Gilmour was sentenced to 16 
months' imprisonment on July 15, 2011, and his release today subject to 
HDC is therefore in line with normal Home Office procedure.'

Despite his conviction, Gilmour is likely to be allowed to complete his history degree next year, the Mail can reveal.

Cambridge University authorities are 
yet to make a formal decision on whether he should be disciplined, but 
have indicated he is extremely unlikely to be expelled.

Gilmour's release comes two days after Remembrance Sunday.

Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former Army colonel, criticised the decision to let him out.

He said: ‘I thought Gilmour had been 
given an exemplary sentence in order to discourage others. I find it odd
therefore that he is being released with barely a quarter of his 
sentence served.’

Gilmour was jailed after admitting violent disorder during the riots in London while high on LSD, Valium and whisky.

He joined a mob which ransacked 
Topshop on Oxford Street, causing £50,000 of damage; attacked the convoy
carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall to the Royal 
Variety Performance; and was photographed swinging from a Union Flag on 
the Cenotaph.

At his trial he tried to excuse himself by claiming he did not know it was the Cenotaph.

But Judge Nicholas Price said that 
explanation ‘defied belief’ and described Gilmour’s behaviour as 
‘outrageous and deeply offensive’.

Last month, Gilmour appealed against 
his sentence, claiming  it was ‘unduly harsh’, but the case was rejected
by the Court of Appeal.

Following his release he is likely to return to his family home in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

Gilmour, pictured with his parents on his way to court, was originally sentenced to 16 months for his rampage through London

The family also have a £2.68million seafront mansion in Hove, East Sussex.

Gilmour will wear the tag until he reaches the halfway point of his sentence, when he will be released on probation.

His family are said to be ‘delighted’ he will be home for Christmas.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on individual prisoners.’

A spokesman for Cambridge University 
said Gilmour had been released from jail too late to start the third 
year of his undergraduate history degree.

He said: ‘There is no way that he 
would be able to resume his studies this year but no decision has been 
taken on whether he can next year.’

Gilmour’s college, Girton, will decide within a month if he can return in October next year to complete his degree.

He could be fined up to £200, suspended or sent down, the Cambridge term for being expelled.

A college spokesman said no students had been sent down in the past decade.
