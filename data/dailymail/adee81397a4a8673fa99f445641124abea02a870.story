Have you ever been so excited by scoring a goal that you felt the need to celebrate by aggressively pulling a goat by its horns?

No, me neither, but Cologne's Nigerian forward Anthony Ujah certainly as the 24-year-old celebrated scoring his side's fourth goal against Frankfurt by doing exactly that.

The goat involved was Cologne mascot Hennes VIII who was quietly minding his own business on the sidelines while watching the game with his handlers.

But Hennes peaceful afternoon in the German sun was short lived as he was rudely pulled away from his tasty grass to be part of one of the weirdest celebrations football has ever seen.

Nigerian international Ujah slotted the ball neatly past Frankfurt's opposition goalkeeper before running to the sidelines screaming before pulling the goat all over the place by it's horns.

Worried handlers appeared to try and stop the former Lillestrom player from pulling Hennes on to the pitch and he eventually let go as his teammates joined in the celebrations. 

The striker later celebrated on his own in a far more normal way following his goal against Frankfurt
