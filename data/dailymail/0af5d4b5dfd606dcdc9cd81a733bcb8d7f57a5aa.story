Arrest: Freddie Starr, pictured last April, has faced a third arrest by officers from Operation Yewtree

Comedian Freddie Starr has been arrested for a third time over alleged sexual offences.

The 71-year-old attended a police station in Warwickshire today by appointment, and was told he faces a further claim of sexual abuse.

Comedian Starr is one of several celebrities to be investigated by police in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

He was first arrested in November 2012 by detectives from Operation Yewtree, the national investigation launched to probe allegations of abuse by high-profile figures.

The first claims were connected to late DJ Savile, who abused hundreds of children at including at hospitals and on BBC premises.

Starr was then arrested again in April last year over further claims that were not connected to Savile.

The Yewtree investigation has been split into three sections - allegations involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving only 'others'.

Scotland Yard did not name the performer, but said: 'Today, Tuesday January 14, "Yewtree 2" was further arrested after attending a police station in Warwickshire by prior appointment.

'The arrest relates to a further allegation made to Operation Yewtree, which falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed "others". We are not prepared to discuss further.

'Yewtree 2 was arrested on November 1 2012 on suspicion of sexual offences and taken into custody. These allegations fall under the strand we have termed "Savile and others".

'He was subsequently released on bail pending further inquiries.'

Starr is due to answer bail next month.

The Liverpool-born comedian fronted Merseybeat band The Midniters in the 1960s and broke into the mainstream when he appeared on the hit talent show Opportunity Knocks.

He later turned to stand-up comedy and after newspaper stories which included one of the most famous tabloid headlines in history, 'Freddie Starr ate my hamster', he hosted his own television variety show.
