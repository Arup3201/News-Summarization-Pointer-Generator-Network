On the anniversary of Kevin Fox's death his family were able to feel his heart beat once more after meeting the man who received the teenager's heart.

In a list of 50 things he wanted to achieve in his life, the 18-year-old who died alongside three of his school friends, had written of his desire to donate his organs to help someone else - a wish that his family honored.

'I can’t even put into words to sum up how I felt,' Colleen Fox said, after meeting the 49-year-old man who was given her brother's heart.

Anthony Hughes, a former employee of the Veterans Administration in Chicago, is overjoyed at a second chance of life, after being given the teenager's heart.

'Sometimes I’m just lost for words,'
he told Fox 8. 'I’m just so happy you know ... that I am able to live again due to Kevin J. Fox.'

The teenager, who had wanted to be a firefighter like his father, was involved in the fatal crash hours before he was due to graduate from Brunswick High School.

The car being driven by his friend Jeffrey Chaya,18, rolled and crashed into a tree after 'jumping' an elevated railway line.

Kevin was thrown from the car and died the following morning. His 16-year-old girlfriend Lexie Poerner, Blake Bartchak, 17, and Jeffrey died at the scene of the crash. Another girl, Julia Romito, 17, survived.

Mr Hughes said at first he found it difficult to think about the crash that killed Kevin, but gave him a second chance at life.

From the moment he woke up 
in hospital, Mr Hughes said he felt different, as if a part of Kevin had become a part of him.

'This
is his heart in me so he is a part of me, and I’m a part of everything 
that revolves around him. That’s why I’m here,' Mr Hughes, who hopes 
their story will generate support for organ donation, said.

Colleen described meeting Mr Hughes as 'overwhelming'.

'It’s amazing to think that this person has Kevin’s 
heart inside him, and I got to feel his chest and got to feel Kevin’s 
heart beat,' she told Fox 8.

'To see that my brother saved this person’s life, it’s 
truly amazing. I’m so proud of him. He wanted to be an organ donor the day he got his license.'

Kevin's family hope that part of his legacy will be that even more lives will be saved.

'They
say everything happens for a reason. I don’t know that reason yet,'  Colleen said. 'If these four angels, if they helped stop somebody 
else from losing their lives, maybe that was part of their purpose.'

Mr Hughes also attended a memorial service for the teenagers on June 3, according to Cleveland.com.

Since Kevin's death the family have tried to fulfill other items on the teenager's bucket list, which he created for a school project.

In July last year, his brother Liam threw the first pitch for the Indians, the baseball team he supported.

His mother, Sherri, said at the time: 'I think he would be smiling, he would be very happy, and he would be very proud that we’re doing this.'

The Ohio Department of Transportation, and local elected officials, have received federal funding to lower the road where the teenagers died.
