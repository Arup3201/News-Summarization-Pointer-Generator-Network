Fertility watchdogs have launched an investigation after a ‘dating-style’ website posted clearly identifiable photographs and personal details of British women who have donated their eggs.

Infertile couples from all  over the world can browse  profiles of the donors, whose faces are clearly visible, to select the characteristics, body types or qualifications.

The site, Premier Egg Donors, is run by Barrie and Tony Drewitt-Barlow, who made history in 1999 when they became the first gay couple to be named on their surrogate twins’ birth certificates.

'I am a vegetarian and a big animal lover - I have a horse and two cats'

Age: 19  5ft 8in, 9st, fit, hazel eyes,  brown hair, fair skin

‘My outlook would be to make the most of your life and enjoy what life can bring.’

Age: 30 5ft 5in, 11st, hazel eyes, brown hair   

‘I am responsible, reliable, have common sense and enjoy learning.’

Age: 22 5ft 5in, 8st 1lb, petite,  blue eyes, brown hair

‘I am independent and have always been inspired by other cultures.’

Since then, the men have fathered three more children by American surrogates, and set up the British Surrogacy Centre in California.

Three months ago, Barrie, 43, from Maldon, Essex, merged BSC and Premier Egg Donors.

Some British women who donated eggs through BSC in the past are now on the Premier Egg Donors site, which is aimed largely at the US market. In contrast to Britain, surrogacy deals in the US are big business.

The 12 British women on the site include a model and a parliamentary researcher. Several include photographs resembling those found on dating sites. One 20-year-old’s personal statement says: ‘I want to give people what I have. A beautiful child is the greatest gift.’

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says that strict laws ban identification of egg donors. But in an apparent legal loophole, responsibility for protecting their identity rests with the licensed clinic where the eggs were donated.

Laura Witjens, chief executive of the National Gamete Donation Trust charity, said: ‘The pictures look like sexy poses. Considering what the website is all about, it’s very distasteful. This is certainly something the HFEA should look into. They’re not acting within the spirit of the UK guidelines.’

In a recent ITV interview promoting their business, the Drewitt-Barlows made no secret of the huge sums to be made in the US by bringing together infertile couples with donors, surrogates and doctors.

Barrie said: ‘In the UK you can only pay a surrogate up to £15,000 in expenses – in the US, we pay them up to £35,000.’

For egg donors, the maximum fee for expenses in Britain is £750, but in America they receive £16,000 to £32,000. The BSC tells British women who want to donate eggs in America that US rules only allow this if they have previously donated elsewhere.

BSC organises egg donation in this country at approved clinics, then says the women are eligible to donate in the US and can appear on the Premier Egg Donors website.

Under HFEA rules, the centres where they donate are responsible for ensuring the women’s identities remain confidential. One British woman in her late 20s who donated eggs a year ago through BSC said that while she initially consented to her profile being featured, she had not realised her details were on the US site until The Mail on Sunday told her.

She had first contacted BSC and was referred for a consultation in London’s Harley Street. ‘I gave them loads of information and a picture,’ she said. A few months later she went to the Herts and Essex Fertility Centre for the donation process.

Barrie Drewitt-Barlow said both Premier Egg Donors and BSC America are based in Los Angeles. He added: ‘Ninety-five per cent of egg donors on this site are American and all donors are for couples going through the IVF process in the US.

'The HFEA does not hold authority in the US. If an English woman wants to advertise as a surrogate – which is also illegal in the UK –  or become an egg donor for couples in the USA, she can and will be identified. All our procedures are in line with the law.’

The HFEA said: ‘It is the responsibility of the UK fertility centre, licensed by the HFEA, to ensure they comply fully with regulatory requirements, such as confidentiality. We will be in contact with the centre involved to investigate.’

The Herts and Essex Fertility Centre said it did not know about one of its patients’ details being on the website and declined to comment.
