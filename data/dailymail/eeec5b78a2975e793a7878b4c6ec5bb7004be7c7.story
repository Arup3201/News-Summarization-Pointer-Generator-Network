An independent adoption agency desperate to find children a home has resorted to advertising them in local newspapers.

Adoptionplus placed full page adverts in three newspapers in Cambridgeshire in a bid to find loving families for 'Liam', four, and 'Kevin', three.

The advert appeals to would-be parents by saying the process of adoption has 'no cost, no waiting time, and no hoops to jump through.'

Adoptionplus placed this full-page advert in three Cambridgeshire newspapers appealing to readers to find 'Luke' and 'Kevin' homes

It appeared in the Fenland Citizen, Cambridge News and Cambridge News and Crier, though the children featured are not thought to be local and have had their names changed.

Joanne Alper, a service director at Adoptionplus, has defended 
the adverts saying the company needed to find an 'imaginative' way to 
encourage adoption, as the number of children looking for a home reached
4,000.

She said: 'Basically the situation is there are four 
thousand children in the UK who need a family and a lot of authorities 
are struggling to find them.

'There is a lot of pressure on them 
to try and be a bit more creative. This advert is a new thing. It is us 
trying something different and it is unusual.

'It is very easy when you just switch on the news and they say 'blah blah blah' but this kind of thing makes it seem more real.

'We just hope this could inspire interest. We try to get rid of myths like that you have to be in a relationship to adopt.

'I
think the fact that there are so many children in the UK that need a 
home is desperately sad and we want to do everything we can.'

But some have slammed the campaign 
saying children should not be advertised in such a way that is 
'unconcerned' with finding them a suitable home.

The agency that was commissioned by a local authority that cannot be named for legal reasons has defended the advert as 'an imaginative' way to find children homes

John
Hemmings MP said the advert sent out the wrong message and would not 
serve the purpose of finding a safe home for vulnerable children.

The
liberal democrat, who represents Birmingham Yardley, said: 'If parents 
with children did something like that they would go to jail.

'We are supposed to protect the identity of children by not naming them or keeping their identity secret.

John Hemming condemned the advert as 'unconcerned' with finding the children suitable homes

'I
find it very odd that local authorities are so keen to keep a child's 
identity secret one minute but then change their minds when it suits 
them.

'They seem to be unconcerned about the household that children end up in.

'It is about box ticking rather than finding them a good home.'

The independent agency was commissioned by a local authority, which cannot be named to protect the children's identities, to find the boys homes.

Adoptionplus is monitored by watchdog Ofsted and was rated as Outstanding in five different categories in February this year.

Staff were described as 'forward thinking' and praised for being 'extremely effective' in finding homes for vulnerable children.Â 

The British Association of Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) said they welcome new ways of encouraging prospective parents, adding: 'It's not something new to us as we are always trying to find ways of rehoming children.'

'We are very careful about where we feature children. We normally change their names or don't talk about location.

'There are over 4,000 children who need to be adopted every year and and there is always the need for parents to come forward.

'It is hard to find homes for older kids and siblings especially.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
