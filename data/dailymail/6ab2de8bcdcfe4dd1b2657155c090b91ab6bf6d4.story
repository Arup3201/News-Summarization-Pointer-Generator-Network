An unruly wind swirled around Haifa on Friday, whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the Mediterranean flying.

It seemed a fittingly uncomfortable Middle Eastern welcome for Wales ahead of what promises to be a match of feverish tenor and great significance.

Here in the Holy Land, Wales want to take a step closer to their long-sought grail: qualification for a major tournament. Not since the 1958 World Cup have they been to a finals competition.

WALES (probable, 5-3-1-1): Hennessey; Gunter, Collins, Williams, Davies, Taylor; Ramsey, Allen, Ledley; Bale; Vokes.

ISRAEL (probable, 4-3-3): Marciano; Dgani, Ben Haim I, Tibi, Ben Harush; Yeini, Natcho, Refaelov; Ben Haim II, Zahavi, Damari.

Israel host Chris Coleman’s team in an encounter that could go some way to defining both sides’ aspirations of reaching Euro 2016. It is first against second in Group B.

Coleman took his players through their final paces in the freshly-built Sammy Ofer Stadium, which will this evening be filled with around 30,000 fanatical Israel supporters, as well as 900 from Wales.

Those travelling fans have not seen their side beaten in this campaign, two wins and two draws, the last point in Belgium a hugely encouraging display and result. Israel have three wins from three, and beat Bosnia 3-0 in their last home game.

This is an opportunity that needs to be seized by Wales, though. Victory would crystalise the promise shown so far and catapult the finals in France nearer into view. Defeat would undermine that promise to the same extent.

Coleman is aware of the importance of this tie, calling it Wales’ biggest since the Euro 2004 play-off against Russia. He hopes to be saying the same when Belgium come to Cardiff in June, but that can only be the case with a positive result here.

The Wales manager has twice been involved in campaigns that came close but failed, at either end of his Wales playing career. In 1993 a missed spot-kick against Romania proved decisive, in 2003 it was an inability to score past Russia over two legs.

Coleman spoke passionately of these memories as he explained his mentality heading into this crucial game. ‘I was part of a couple of great Welsh sides that never did it,’ he said. ‘I enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever.

‘We have a good current group, we are going in the right direction but we have been here before. One foot in the door does not get you there. I do not want to play things down, we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about. But we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go.’

His opposition manager Eli Guttman was in jovial mood, making sarcastic remarks about calling Cristiano Ronaldo for advice and insisting Gareth Bale must be worth his £86million fee because Real Madrid paid it.

Coleman struck a different chord. ‘I feel focused,’ he said. ‘I am looking forward to it. We have had a real good week of preparation. I am nervous, excited. Any manager who says he is relaxed is telling you a lie.

‘All we can do is focus on performance and the plan. That has been the secret of our success so far.’

Having Bale in your midst must provide a comfort blanket, even amid extreme criticism of his form emanating from Madrid. The 25-year-old loves playing for his country, where he is among long-term friends. No-one belts out the national anthem louder. 

Wales boss Chris Coleman is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in Haifa on Saturday

He has not scored in three internationals, but dragged Wales to victory in Andorra in the opening game of this campaign to set the tone, scoring a retaken free-kick nine minutes from time.

Bale is likely to start in a free role behind the striker with a 5-3-2 formation mooted. But Israel will start right back Orel Dgani for the first time and Coleman said he would explore Bale’s position as the match took shape.

‘If there is a weakness to be exploited then of course you look at it,’ he said. ‘We’ve changed tactically during a match before.’

It is not all about Bale. Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams are elite players operating in the Premier League. Williams will win his 50th cap. There is youth, but experience.

Coleman acknowledged Israel’s potency in attack, with RB Leipzig’s Omer Damari leading the line looking to add to his five goals in qualification, level with Danny Welbeck. No player has more.

Tal Ben Haim, once of Chelsea, Manchester City and Bolton, is the most recognisable name in Israel’s line-up.

He wears the armband and is predicting an even louder noise at the Sammy Ofer than the one that stunned Bosnia.

‘I know British football but it will not make it easier for me,’ he said. ‘In the last game all the players spoke about the crowd and we expect against Wales the atmosphere will be even better.’
