A ten-year-old boy in China has become the poster boy for anti-family cruelty campaigners after being beaten black and blue by his violent stepmother.

Bin Bin, a pupil at a primary school in Heyuan city in Guangdong province, was asked by his teacher why he seemed in pain every time he moved.

The boy burst into tears, before admitting he did not want to go home as his stepmother would regularly tie him to a clothes rack so she could carry out savage beatings.

The case has sparked outrage after images of his sickening injuries were leaked by an education official.

The youngster described how he was tied up for the attacks that happened on an almost daily basis.

And when he was taken to the head teacher and asked to show his body, they found every inch covered in bruises.

'She beats me all the time,' he admitted, showing bruised and lacerated flesh.

He said the most recent beating occurred because he got soaked in a downpour when going home from school.

'She said I had been playing in water and punished me with a leather strap,' he said.

Photos were taken of his injuries by school authorities. It is thought education officials may have leaked the images to the media.

His teacher Quiong Yang said: 'He is such a sweet and kind little boy. It broke my heart when he recounted this tale of cruelty.

'His stepmother is jealous of the boy's relationship to his dad and it seems she has not managed to have a child.

'She said he must help her do housework each day and if he misses any speck of dirt he gets another thrashing.'

Police have become involved and a criminal probe has been opened.
