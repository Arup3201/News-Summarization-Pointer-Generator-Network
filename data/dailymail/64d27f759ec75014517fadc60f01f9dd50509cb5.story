When little Bo Cornwell, three, blushed and turned bashfully into her father Matt's shoulder upon coming face to face with the Duchess of Cambridge yesterday, hearts melted all over the world.

But her shyness came as a surprise to Matt who says that not only is Bo not normally particularly timid, she actually thought the Duchess was very beautiful.

'She can be shy sometimes,' says the professional sailor, 40, from Southampton. 'But after she met the Duchess, she said she thought the Duchess was beautiful and lovely. She was more scared of the men behind her!'

'The Duchess was complimentary about Bo's dress and said how beautiful the flowers were. She's very nice - she's just got that charm.'

But while Bo's day might have ended on a high note, no one was smiling more than her father, for whom winning the America's Cup for Britain is a long-cherished dream.

'For a sailor, it's the pinnacle,' he enthuses. 'I grew up in a sailing family and it was always about the America's Cup.

'The real rockstars of my sport were doing it and I never thought that it might be me one day, but when I got the opportunity to take part in 2003, I jumped at it.'

Unfortunately, his first taste of the America's Cup ended with GBR Challenge crashing out in the quarter final after losing to American catamaran Stars & Stripes.

That, however, will make victory taste all the sweeter should Matt, and his colleague Sir Ben Ainslie, take home the trophy in 2017.

'If you read through early history of the America's Cup, Brits
 were so often there in the final and it's good to remember that,' he enthuses.

'Winning it in 2017 really would be one 
for the history books and I think we've got technology and sailors here that are as good as anyone else's.'

Known affectionately as the 'Auld Mug', the America's Cup was first offered as a prize by Queen Victoria in 1851, who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the Isle of Wight.

After a schooner named America from New York took the trophy, which was made especially for the race by jewellers Garrard, the cup was renamed in its honour, and both trophy and race have carried the moniker ever since.

Despite its British origins, the cup has never been taken by a British team, with the American's clinging on tenaciously to dominate the victor's roll of honour, although Swiss and Australian teams have triumphed in the past.

'A lot of good men have tried and failed to win it,' adds Matt.
 'One of the reasons the cup has lasted so long is because it's so hard to win.'

'If you do win it, then you can take it home and you own it completely, which means you can then rewrite the rules and stack the decks in your favour, making it hard for anyone to take it from you.'

One team which has done exactly that is current holders Oracle USA, a San Francisco outfit that has held the America's Cup since 2010, and were helped to victory last year by none other than Sir Ben Ainslie.

Whether this year's contenders, Team Australia, can manage to wrest it from them is yet to be decided but Matt thinks Britain should be in with a good shout come 2017.

'In recent years, sailing hasn't had much support because it isn't a mainstream sport but we've
 got a great opportunity with Ben [Ainslie] on board and that should give the bid a boost.'

In the 
meantime, he's working with Ainslie to get more supporters on side for 
the 2017 bid for victory and says he is thrilled by the amount of 
attention yesterday's launch garnered.

'The Duchess' involvement helped straight away in the obvious sense that it's already getting more attention,' he enthuses.

'It's all been very positive. It's also very much about being British and doing this for the UK - we want to get the support of the country if we can and having the Duchess of Cambridge on board really helps.'

But while he's looking forward to getting back on his catamaran and competing in another America's Cup race, he's got another sailing fan to heave to with first - his small daughter Bo.

'I took her out for the first time the other day and I was almost more excited than her,' he beams. 'If she turned around one day and said, "Dad, I want to be a sailor too", then I'd be very pleased.

'I don't think I'd push them too hard [Bo and her brother Nate, one] but I'd give them all the support I could and I'd tell her that if you work as hard as you can, then you can achieve a lot in this sport.'

For Matt and fellow sailor Sir Ben Ainslie, the next few years could prove very hard work indeed but the rewards for them - and for Britain - could be just as impressive.
