A top conductor honoured by the Queen for his services to children’s choirs appeared in court alongside his wife  yesterday jointly charged with raping a former pupil.

Michael Brewer, who was awarded an OBE and took part in the BBC series Last Choir Standing, is also accused of indecently assaulting the girl during his time at a  prestigious music school.

Yesterday the 67-year-old appeared in the dock alongside his wife Hilary, who also faces charges of rape and indecent assault against the same ex-pupil.

Afterwards Brewer said he would be 
‘strenuously denying’ the charges, which date back more than 30 years 
and follow a historic sexual abuse investigation.

He faces trial over one count of rape
 and six counts of indecent assaults on the girl when she was aged 
between 13 and 18. His wife, also 67, faces one count of rape and one of
 indecent assault.

The charges date to a time when Brewer was director of music at Chetham’s School in Manchester.
He subsequently co-founded the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain, 
serving as its musical director until he was suspended following his 
arrest.

An accomplished double bass player as
 well as an internationally-renowned choral conductor, Brewer – known as
 Mike – has written several books about directing a choir.

According to his online biography, he
 has been a regular adjudicator for the BBC Choir of the Year 
competition, including this year’s event.

In addition he led a series of 
workshops for BBC1’s Last Choir Standing show in 2008. Brewer’s years of
 work – which has included conducting the World Youth Choir – saw him 
awarded the OBE in 1995.

The couple arrived and left 
Manchester Magistrates’ Court separately yesterday as they made their 
first appearance over the charges.

After District Judge Jonathan Taaffe 
was told the charges against the pair were ‘inextricably linked’, they 
were asked to stand in the dock together.

Mrs Brewer spoke only to give her full name, date of birth and an address in Rossendale, Lancashire.

Her husband then gave his details, 
providing the court with an address in Selly Oak, Birmingham. No pleas 
were taken and the couple were told to attend Manchester Crown Court for
 a preliminary hearing later this month.

Existing bail conditions which include requiring Brewer not to have any unsupervised contact with under-18s were maintained.

After being told they were free to leave, Brewer told the Daily Mail: ‘I’m strenuously denying these charges.’

According to Greater Manchester 
Police, the alleged offences took place at the school in the city and at
 an address in the suburb of Chorlton between 1977 and 1982.

Chetham’s claims to be Britain’s largest specialist music school with nearly 300 students.
