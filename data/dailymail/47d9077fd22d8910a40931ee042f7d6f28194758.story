Was Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain always destined for England recognition?

The Arsenal star took to Instagram on Thursday night to upload a picture of himself as a youngster head-to-toe in a Three Lions home strip - his first ever football kit.

The 21-year-old used the picture as part of the trend 'Throwback Thursday' with the midfielder accompanying the post with the caption: '#TB to my first football kit! My parents were clearly planning for it to last me a good few years… "That's the perfect size, plus you've got a bit of room for growth."'

Fast-forward to the present and the Southampton academy graduate has won 20 international caps for his country - winning 14 of those games and drawing six.

Despite being a firm figure in the senior squad, Oxlade-Chamberlain's age means he is still eligible to play for the Under 21 side at this summer's European Championships.

Former England U21 manager Stuart Pearce believes his successor Gareth Southgate must pick the midfielder along with other senior England internationals who can qualify for the tournament.

Pearce, who was unable to select a raft of eligible stars from the senior squad for the last U21 Championship, thinks they would benefit immensely if he went to the Czech Republic.

'England have to take their best players, all of the best players - not just one or two - for me you send the biggest squad out there,' the former England Under-21 coach told TalkSPORT.

'They are playing against the best in Europe at Under-21 level, the seniors are in a fantastic position for qualification. Roy (Hodgson) has done a good job in putting them at the top of their qualifying group, so you are not going to lose a great deal in regard to one or two of our brightest young players going to the Under-21s. The only thing you will do is gain.'

England senior boss Roy Hodgson has said Southgate is free to choose whoever he wants for the tournament.

That means Southgate could choose Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere, Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Saido Berahino - who have all received senior call-ups.
