Club England Managing Director at the Football Association Adrian Bevington believes it is 'embarrassing' that Chris Powell is the only black manager in the Football League and has called on the FA to generate more opportunities for ethnic minorities.

Powell took charge of Huddersfield earlier this week but his appointment only served to highlight the lack of diversity in the top four divisions of English football.

In recent seasons Chris Hughton, Paul Ince, Chris Kiwomya, Keith Curle and Terry Connor have all managed in the Football League but none of them are currently a number one.

Changes afoot: Club England Managing Director Adrian Bevington wants more opportunities out there

And former FA spokesman Bevington has pointed out that the current record is not good enough and has urged the national governing body to do more.

'I think for the game it’s embarrassing that we have only Chris Powell as the only black manager in the four divisions,' he said on BBC Radio 5 live.

'The fact is from an FA point of view we’ve got to be more proactive in this way. We’ve recently had (former Tottenham assistant) Chris Ramsay, Chris Powell and (former Aston Villa and Middlesbrough defender) Ugo Ehiogu spending certain time with our development teams but we’ve got to get better than this.

'As an industry you can’t have such a high percentage of black players and that’s without looking at other ethnic groups as well - they need to be on boards, on senior management of organisations and they certainly need to be very visible within the coaching staff and the backroom staff of our national teams.'

Bevington has also given his backing to Roy Hodgson despite a chastening last few months for the England manager, who oversaw a woeful World Cup campaign before his side toiled against Norway in front of a half-empty Wembley.

Hodgson himself has admitted he has plenty to do to get England fans back onside and Bevington believes the former Fulham and West Brom boss should not shoulder the burden on his own.

'We went through the last qualifying campaign unbeaten, we topped the group, I think we were one of the highest goalscorers across the qualification campaign,' Bevington added.

'Obviously we are disappointed with the World Cup, there’s no getting away from that, but Roy has a contract to 2016 and it’s his job now, and with our support, to take us forward.

'The challenge is with us as a collective, not just with Roy.'

Support: Bevington has worked with Hodgson since he started his job at the FA

Pressure: While it looks like England have a good route to the Euros Hodgson needs to improve his side
