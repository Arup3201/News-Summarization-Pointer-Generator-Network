The families of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, who were both killed by white police officers have condemned the shooting deaths of two New York City officers.

In a statement posted on Saturday on Twitter, Brown's family rejects 'any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot be tolerated.'

Speaking via the Parks & Crump law firm, the 18-year-old's relatives call on citizens to 'work together to bring peace to our communities.'

Denounced the killings: Gwen Carr, Eric Garner's mother, also spoke at the National Action Network event to denounce the shooting death of two New York City cops

The brief statement concludes saying, 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the officers' families during this incredibly difficult time.'

Their response was prompted by the news that Ismaaiyl Brinsley killed officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in an act of revenge for Michael Brown and Eric Garner. 

A Missouri grand jury refused to indict the white officer who shot Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old.

Weeks later, a grand jury in Staten Island acquitted the white officer who killed father-of-six Garner while arresting him for selling loose cigarettes.

Reverend Al Sharpton spoke for Garner's family in a statement, saying: 'I have spoken to the Garner family and we are outraged by the early reports of the police killed in Brooklyn today.

'We plan to hold a press conference in the morning to express our outrage and our condolences to the families and the police department.'
