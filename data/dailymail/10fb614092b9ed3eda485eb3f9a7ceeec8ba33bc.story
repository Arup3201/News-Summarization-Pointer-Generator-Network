These remarkable images show the beautiful gala pool of the Victoria Baths filled with water once again, two decades after it closed its doors.

The pool was filled with 86,000 gallons of water for the first time in four years to celebrate the historic baths receiving £3.4million from BBC TV show Restoration.

Synchronised swimmers from group Aquabatix took to the water to mark the anniversary of the funding - received ten years ago from the show.

Return to form: The Victoria Baths' main feature, the 75ft by 40ft gala pool (left),  filled with 86,000 gallons of water for the first time in four years. Synchronised swimmers, right, celebrate the occasion by performing a routine

Standing empty: The beautiful baths, pictured from the outside above, stood empty for 10 years before receiving funding from Restoration 10 years ago

Before: The pool, one of two in the Victoria Baths building that received £3.4million of funding from the BBC, pictured empty

Unused: In the past, the pool was used to train both male and female professional and synchronised swimmers

First opened in 1906, the pool was the breeding ground for numerous swimming champions before it closed in 1993.

At the time, swimmers took to the streets in protest to try and prevent the closure of the building - which includes two swimming pools and a Turkish Bath area.

But as the Baths were expensive to run, they closed on 13 March 1993.

Ten years later, the building won a public vote to receive £3.4m 
of funding from the BBC show.

Thousands of viewers voted for the beautiful building to receive the funding and work started almost immediately.

Since then, that money has been spent restoring the building - 
including a new £13,000 ‘Aqua’ stained glass above the gala pool, which was unveiled yesterday.

External work: Almost all of the £3.4million BBC funding was used to restore the outside of the Victoria Baths

Restored: The striking 'Aqua' window, left, has been restored, having been boarded up since 1993. Other glass-work in doors into the pools, right, has also been renovated

The striking window was created by glass specialist Design 
Lights, based in Bolton, and includes 493 individual pieces of glass set into 12 panels.

It was made using archive images of the original window, which had been boarded up since the Bath's closure.

An additional £2million has been raised by the Victoria Baths Trust and spent on the work.

But those behind the project say the 
baths are a long way from being fully restored - and need an additional 
£20million of funding to complete the necessary work.

Gill Wright, Project
Manager of the Victoria Baths Trust, said the anniversary was a great day for the 
baths and it signaled a landmark in its continued restoration.

She said: 'Seeing the gala pool filled again today has reignited the excitement around the baths and our vision for the future.

 'Had the baths not won BBC Restoration ten years ago, we would never have been able to achieve what we have.

Making a splash: The swimmers performed a series of athletic jumps and dives to celebrate the 10-year anniversary

'There’s still a long way to go but we are absolutely determined
in our mission to reopen the Turkish baths and one of the pools to the 
public once again. We would like to thank those who have supported our 
progress both locally and across the country, and invite them to join us
at our upcoming Heritage Open Days, which will be another chance for 
people to explore the building and join in the celebration.'

Other celebrations took part on the anniversary, yesterday including a performance from the well known synchronised
group Aquabatix, who performed at comedian David Walliams’s wedding and features 
Katie Dawkins and Katie Skelton who competed at the London 2012 Olympic 
Games.

The event also marked the launch of the Historic Pools Network, a new UK-wide support group spearheaded by Victoria Baths to share ideas about restoration and fund-raising projects.

A series of further celebrations are due to take place this month, including a cello concert on Thursday 12 September.
