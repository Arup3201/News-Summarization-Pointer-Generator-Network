Relief: Gary McKinnon with his mother Janis yesterday. He will not face any criminal charges

Gary McKinnon’s ten-year nightmare was finally over yesterday after police and prosecutors decided he will not stand trial in Britain.

The computer hacker won his fight against extradition two months ago when Theresa May blocked US demands to send him there.

That decision marked a victory for the Daily Mail’s An Affront to British Justice campaign.

Now Director of Public Prosecutions 
Keir Starmer has announced that the 46-year-old Asperger’s sufferer, who
 medical experts warned would be very likely to kill himself if 
extradited, will not face criminal charges in this country either.

Speaking last night Mr McKinnon said: ‘This is the cherry on the cake, it’s just amazing.

‘It has been a terrifying experience hanging over me for so long. I now feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me.’

His mother Janis Sharp said: ‘This will be the 11th Christmas since his arrest and it is the first time we can celebrate.

‘We can all now finally breathe a sigh
 of relief. I no longer have the feeling of constant terror that my son 
will be taken away from me.’

The decision not to bring charges came on Mrs Sharp’s 64th birthday. She added: ‘I couldn’t ask for a better birthday present.

‘It’s just wonderful. The next thing I would like to get, impossible though it seems, would be a pardon from President Obama.’

Mrs Sharp said she hoped that the US 
authorities would now drop their extradition warrant for her son, who 
has always been willing to stand trial in the UK.

Threat: The autistic alleged hacker was saved from extradition to the U.S. in October

‘He regrets what he’s done. He wishes 
he hadn’t done it. He wishes he hadn’t upset the Americans. We all 
regret it. But I’m grateful to Theresa May that this is all over now.’

If extradited, Mr McKinnon, from Wood 
Green, North London, faced up to 60 years behind bars for hacking into 
Pentagon and Nasa computers looking for the existence of ‘little green 
men’.

But in a dramatic, 11th-hour decision 
in October, the Home Secretary defied  American demands and blocked his 
removal under the controversial 2003 Extradition Act.

Her announcement, in a statement to 
the Commons, drew cheers from MPs and marked a watershed for the Mail 
campaign, launched in 2009 to allow Mr McKinnon to be tried here.

The campaign had attracted widespread 
political support and celebrities had also added their voices in the 
fight to keep him in the UK.

Mrs May told MPs that his extradition 
‘would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a 
decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr McKinnon’s human 
rights’.

His fate then rested in the hands of the DPP, who had to decide whether Mr McKinnon should stand trial in a British court.

In a statement on behalf of the Crown 
Prosecution Service and Metropolitan Police, Mr Starmer said nothing had
 changed from 2002, when it was decided that the appropriate place for a
 trial was the United States. He said: ‘Most of the witnesses are in the
 US, as is nearly all the physical evidence and the bulk of the unused 
material, some of which is sensitive.’

No charge: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, ruled that Mr McKinnon should not stand trial

British prosecutors met US Justice officials last month to discuss transferring the case  to Britain.

But Mr Starmer said: ‘The potential 
difficulties in bringing a case in England and Wales now should not be 
underestimated, not least the passage of time, the logistics of 
transferring sensitive evidence prepared for a court in the US to London
 for trial, the participation of US government witnesses in the trial 
and the need fully to comply with the duties of disclosure imposed on 
the CPS.

‘The prospects of a conviction against Mr McKinnon which reflects the full extent of his alleged criminality are not high.’

How Mail took up the fight

The Americans had been willing to 
co-operate, said the DPP, but he added: ‘However, they do not consider 
that making all the US witnesses available for trial in London and 
transferring all of the US material to this jurisdiction would be in the
 interests of justice given our representations and the reasons for the 
decision that the US was the appropriate forum.’

Mr McKinnon’s lawyer Karen Todner 
said: ‘I have mixed feelings about this – I am pleased he is not going 
to be prosecuted because I wouldn’t want to think he would ever spend 
any time in prison given his mental situation.

‘But I am disappointed because the 
extradition warrant is still outstanding because he can’t travel 
anywhere outside of the UK and will have this hanging over him until 
it’s resolved.’
