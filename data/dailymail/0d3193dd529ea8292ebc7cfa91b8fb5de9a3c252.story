Barcelona's Neymar believes the Catalan club's strike force of himself, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez is stronger than Real Madrid's, which consists of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.

Brazil international Neymar was asked if Barcelona's attacking force is more dangerous than Madrid's and he said: 'I think so.

'But we focus on ourselves, we don't think about the opponents.

'We try to do damage to rival defences and every day we understand each other better. They are two brilliant players.

'Leo is the best in the world and Suarez is a great goalscorer. It is an honour for me to play with them. They are two brilliant players.' 

Madrid were beaten 1-0 by Athletic Bilbao at the weekend, while Barcelona thrashed Rayo Vallecano 6-1, meaning they replaced Madrid atop La Liga.
