It may look like the aftermath of a riot or a particularly savage burglary - but in actual fact this is the latest stress-busting treatment from Italy.

The 'rage chamber' is a fully-furnished room where people suffering from stress can vent their frustration.

And according to creator Cristian Castagnoli, it has saved marriages and jobs by providing a harmless outlet for pent-up rage.

Italians have been taking out their rage in style in a new rage chamber created by Cristian Castagnoli

For just 35 euros (£28) visiotrs are armed with a baseball bat and sledgehammer and allowed to take out their frustrations on a room of furniture

The rage chamber is filled with second hand furniture and glass bottles for stress-busters to lay into

Armed with a baseball bat, participants are given helmets and gloves before trashing everything within reach.

For 35 euros, angry men and women can experience 60 minutes of complete madness without raising an eyebrow.

Italian entrepreneur Castagnoli created his chamber in Forli, Italy, after being inspired by similar anger rooms in America.

He said: 'Smashing the furniture in a room is a great way to vent.

'All of the furniture is strictly second hand and afterwards you will return home more peaceful and serene than ever.'

And Castagnonoli should know, having trashed the chamber himself.

He
 said: 'It's a very nice sensation. When you get out, you feel peaceful 
and relaxed, a bit like a nice gym session or a long run.'

The rage chamber, or the Camera della Rabbia as it is called in Italy, has a wide appeal for people from all walks of life.

The 36-year-old said: 'There are lots of customers of every kind, including housewives, students, managers, self-employed, unemployed and business owners.

'We had people who saved their 
marriages because, instead of arguing with their partners, they had one 
session inside the Camera della Rabbia.

'We
 had employers who didn't fire their employees who've messed up, because
 they vented their rage inside the Camera della Rabbia.

Visitors to the chamber are given a helmet, a face mask, shoes and gloves before being turned loose

Mr Castagnoli says the idea has proved so popular he is patenting the idea and opening a franchise

'We've also had employees who kept their job because instead of screaming back to their bosses, they removed their stress inside the Camera della Rabbia.

'We even hold stag and hen dos, birthday parties, graduations and surprise parties.

'We often get people coming back once a month for a gym session.

'Business is good, that's why we're already trademarking and patenting everything around the idea, and starting a franchise.'
