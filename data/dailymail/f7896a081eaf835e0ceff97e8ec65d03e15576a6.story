The storming of the BP gas plant in Algeria and murder of dozens of hostages was orchestrated by a Canadian, it emerged yesterday.

Documents found on the bodies of two terrorists – one a ringleader – identified them as Canadians and Western intelligence agencies were checking last night whether either was ‘known’ to them.

Survivors have told how at least one of the kidnappers spoke perfect English in giving them orders.

Both Canadians entered Algeria from Libya with members of the ‘Blood Battalion’ led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar.

One-eyed fugitive: Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian who fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of up to 41 foreigners at an Algerian gas field

Armed to the teeth: The terrorists' weapons, recovered by Algerian special forces, included six machine guns, 21 rifles, two mortars with shells, two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and ten explosive belts

Their cars were painted in the colours of the Algerian state energy firm, Sonatrach.

Only part of one of the men’s names –
 ‘Chedad,’ which is Moroccan – was released yesterday but British 
investigators were seeking to establish whether either Canadian had 
spent time in Britain or had UK links.

The development raises fears that the
 Arab Spring has been a rallying call for extremists. Hundreds of 
Britons and Westerners joined the fighting in the Middle East and North 
Africa and some may have subsequently joined violent groups abroad or 
terror gangs back home.

Significantly, a Briton who is 
believed to be an Islamic convert in his late 20s with blond hair and 
blue eyes is said to have joined one-eyed Belmokhtar’s group last year. 
He is reported to have visited wounded jihadists at a hospital in 
south-east Mali.

And a second British jihadist linked 
to the terror leader is said to be a Londoner, who was captured by the 
Mauritanian authorities last month trying to cross into Mali.

The BBC was criticised yesterday for calling the gang behind the Algeria hostage killings ‘militants’ rather than ‘terrorists’.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he was disappointed that the broadcaster was ‘consistently’ using the term.

The BBC has specific guidance about the  word terrorist, warning its reporters that it can imply value judgments. In one report on its website, it described the killers as ‘militants’ 12 times. The word ‘terrorist’ appeared only in a quote.

Mr Bridgen quizzed David Cameron on the issue yesterday and the Prime Minister agreed that he had a ‘good point’. He added: ‘These are terrorists and they should be described as such.’

Investigators say the men are part of
 a ‘small but increasing and significant’ number of Britons or foreign 
nationals living in the UK and travelling to join extremist groups with 
loose associations to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.

It is thought Britons and other Europeans may have attended terror camps in the Sahel region to the south of the Sahara.

The Canadian link has long been 
feared, according to David Harris of the terrorist intelligence 
programme at Insignis Strategic Research in Ottawa.

He said the country’s open borders 
and dual language made it attractive to French-speaking immigrants from 
North Africa. French anti-terrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière has 
called Montreal a hub of North African terrorism.

Four years ago, a Canadian, Momin 
Khawaja, was jailed for ten years for his part in planning a fertiliser 
bomb plot in Britain for which five people were convicted in the UK.

Khawaja, 33, made numerous trips from his home in Ottawa to London claiming to be seeking a wife.

He was actually helping to plan the attack, which was foiled by British police.

Algeria’s prime minister yesterday 
said 37 foreigners of eight nationalities and one Algerian worker were 
killed during the hostage crisis. At least 29 militants also died.

Abdelmalek Sellal, who strongly 
defended the actions of his special forces in storming the BP plant, 
said the terrorists had worn army uniforms, memorised the layout of the 
vast complex and were intending to blow it up.

The plant, which is vital to the Algerian economy, is expected to resume operations today.
Jihadists yesterday threatened more hostage-taking unless Western powers leave Mali.

Updating MPs in the House of Commons this afternoon, David Cameron said the process of bringing home the bodies of the victims was Britain's top priority, but might take some time.

David Cameron, pictured outside Downing Street today, was due to update MPs on the situation in Algeria this afternoon.

Mr Cameron said his deepest 
condolences were with the families of the victims and told the Commons 
work to clear the site of potential traps was continuing.

He said: 'Now our most vital work is 
bringing home those who died. An international team of British, American
 and Norwegian experts is in close co-operation with the Algerian 
ministry of justice undertaking the task of formally identifying their 
bodies.

'We want this process to happen as 
swiftly as possible but it will involve some intensive forensic and 
policing work and so may take some time.'

He said 800 employees were working at plant at the time of the attack, 135 of whom were foreign nationals.

More than 40 of those were taken hostage and at least 12 were killed, with at least a further 20 unaccounted for and feared dead, he said.

The number of terrorists was over 30, most of whom were killed during the incident, while 'a small number' had been taken into Algerian custody.

He said evolving nature of the global terrorist
 threat demanded a 'tough, intelligent, patient' response based on strong international partnerships.

Earlier, the PM's official spokesman stressed that the Government's position that UK 
troops will not take on a combat role in Mali remained unchanged.

The spokesman told a regular 
Westminster media briefing: 'Clearly in Mali at the moment there is a 
military response in terms of French forces supporting the Malian 
government.

'We very much support the French in 
that but our position about troops not being in a combat role is 
completely unchanged with regard to Mali.

'More widely, as the Foreign 
Secretary was saying in the context of Somalia, when it comes to 
military roles our view is very much that they should be 
regionally-led.'

Asked whether Mr Cameron was content 
with Algiers' response to the siege, the spokesman said: 'We were always
 very clear that there there were difficult decisions that faced the 
Algerian authorities. It was a fluid, fast-moving event. We were not 
going to rush into making judgments.'

He added: 'The Prime Minister said 
yesterday that we should be very clear that the responsibility for the 
loss of life lies with the terrorists.

'We recognise what the Algerians have
 done to co-ordinate with us. He thanked them for that and he also noted
 the Algerian loss of life and the fact that this was an attack against 
an Algerian site.'

The spokesman said Britain would 'work with our international partners' to bring those responsible for the killings to justice.

Asked about claims made during the 
siege by the hostage-takers' leader, Abdul Rahman al-Nigeri, that he had
 been in contact with British officials, Mr Cameron's spokesman said: 
'We don't negotiate with terrorists.

'That has always been and remains our policy. I have seen these reports but I am not going to go into details.'
