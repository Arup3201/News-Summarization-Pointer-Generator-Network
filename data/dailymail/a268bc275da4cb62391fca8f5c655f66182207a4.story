A ship which has suffered a second outbreak of the Norovirus in little over six months is due to set sail on another cruise later today after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has conducted tests and the vessel has undergone a thorough disinfecting.

The Crown Princess is due to arrive in California on Sunday carrying 172 people who have fallen ill with the highly contagious virus during their nearly month-long trip.

The ship has more than 4,100 people on board and will be met by CDC staff upon arrival in San Pedro. CDC staff will conduct testing and evaluate the response.

The Crown Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, has suffered a second outbreak of the Norovirus in little over six months but is still due to set sail on another cruise this evening after a thorough cleaning

Over the last few days, crew members said an increased number of gastrointestinal illnesses caused by Norovirus were reported.

Princess Cruises has ‘enacted our stringent disinfecting protocols’ developed in consultation with the CDC and will do a deep cleaning of the ship and terminal in Los Angeles before departing on Sunday night for a weeklong cruise through the Mexican Riviera, said spokeswoman Susan Lomax.

The 28-day cruise visited Hawaii and Tahiti.

In April, 129 people on the same ship contracted Norovirus during a seven-day cruise off the California coast. Lomax said that the ship went through the same stringent disinfecting process after it docked.

‘As it is the cold and flu season, when the stomach flu circulates on land, we encourage all of our guests to be diligent in following the widely accepted practices of frequent hand washing with soap and water and the use of hand sanitizers,’ Lomax said.

Norovirus is very contagious and can be transmitted from an infected person, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces.

Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, fever and body aches. According to the CDC, most people recover within three days.

In the month of January alone, the CDC reported that there were in excess of 600 cases of Norovirus on cruise ships in the Caribbean.
