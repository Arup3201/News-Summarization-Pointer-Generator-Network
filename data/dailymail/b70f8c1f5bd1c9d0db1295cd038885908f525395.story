Tour operator Thomas Cook has been ordered to pay more than £2,000 to a couple who says their dream getaway was ruined by ‘loutish yobs’ and filthy conditions at their resort.

John and Tracey Erskine, who have been married for 20 years, were expecting a relaxing trip on the Mediterranean coast in Turkey when they splurged on the holiday in September 2012.

But they say Thomas Cook didn’t deliver on its promise of an ‘outstanding holiday experience’ and their stay turned into a nightmare.

John and Tracey Erskine took legal action against Thomas Cook after staying at the Voyage Torba in Turkey

Filthy: John and Tracey Erskine complained about dirty conditions, including mouldy walls, at their resort

The Erskines were awarded £2,120 in compensation plus court costs at Warrington County Court after a drawn-out fight with the travel company, but they insist the legal fight was not about the money.

The grandparents, who represented themselves during the hearing, complained that they were verbally abused by ‘loutish yobs’ in an apartment just 15ft away and one man from the group performed a sex act on himself on the balcony. 

They were unhappy with their all-inclusive resort, the Voyage Torba in Turkey, because its toilets were leaking and the walls were mouldy and dirty.

They booked the getaway after picking up a copy of the Thomas Cook Style Collection brochure, which claimed to showcase its 'top four-star and above hotels’.

It was revealed in court that a Thomas Cook rep arranged for the couple to be moved rooms twice after they complained.

But the Erskines felt there was still a ‘lack of care’ by the travel company and not enough was done to protect them from the ‘vile’ group of men.

When they returned to their home near Winwick, Warrington, Cheshire, they wrote to Thomas Cook but their complaints were ignored.

They started legal proceedings for £3,278 to cover the cost of the holiday and compensation.

Thomas Cook denied that it could be held accountable and said its rep had done ‘all she reasonably could'

At the end of the drawn-out ordeal, Mrs 
Erskine, a former member of Merseyside police, said: ‘I feel relieved 
more than happy that it is finally over.

‘I am disappointed that we had to go to such great lengths for them to acknowledge what happened to us. It was never about the money - it was the principle of the matter.’

The Erskines booked the holiday as a belated 50th birthday present for John, now aged 53, following a traumatic year.

Mrs Erskine, 51, said: ‘We were looking for a relaxing break where we could some spend time together.

‘We wanted peace and serenity and that's what we thought we were going to get.’

'Lack of care': The Erskines felt Thomas Cook did not do enough to protect them from the ‘vile’ group of men

Josephine Scally, who represented Thomas Cook in court, admitted that it was a ‘horrendous’ experience but denied that the company could be held accountable for the problems and said the rep had done ‘all she reasonably could’.

She said: ‘The fault lies with the management and the representative of the clearly unpleasant young men.’

A Thomas Cook spokesman said the company is ‘disappointed by the outcome’ but accepts the judge’s decision.

He said: ‘This incident was very much an isolated occurrence and we are confident that those due to stay at the property will enjoy the quality holiday experience they would come to expect from Thomas Cook.’
