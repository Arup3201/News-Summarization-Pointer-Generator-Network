A wealthy businessman has admitted he will make £80,000 a year from erecting a 150ft wind turbine – despite opposition from neighbours.

Yacht broker Harry Standley hopes to increase his income by putting up the £500,000 turbine, which locals have labelled a ‘monstrosity’.

It would join two smaller turbines already standing on his 270-acre farm in Laxfield, Suffolk.

The 70-year-old claims he is a strong believer in renewable energy and wants to help cut the country’s use of fossil fuels.

But
his plan has angered residents, including former BBC royal 
correspondent Michael Cole, who have accused him of seeking to make 
money rather than save the planet.

Mr
Standley said: ‘It’s my land and I am simply reacting to the 
Government’s renewable energy scheme – if people don’t then there will 
be a huge energy gap.’

The proposed turbine (left) will stand at a towering 150ft - taller than the village church. Ex-BBC Royal correspondent Michael Cole, who lives near Mr Standley,  has spoken out against the businessman's plans

Mr Cole, who can already see one wind turbine from the bottom of his driveway in Suffolk (pictured), accused Mr Standley of seeking to make money rather than save the planet

The 
firm that will supply Mr Standley’s turbine, Mosscliff Environmental, 
said some owners could net as much as £100,000 a year from a single 
250kW turbine that fed power directly into the National Grid.

Spokesman Jack Abbott said: ‘We would expect Mr Standley’s installation to generate him £80,000 a year.

‘The Government is trying to incentivise landowners like Mr Standley to invest in renewable energy.

The site of the proposed turbine. Mr Standley claims it will be 'totally compliant with all the necessary regulations' and will have no effect on the surrounding environment

‘He is helping to kick-start the 
renewable energy industry in this country which will in the long run 
help to reduce energy bills for all.’

Former
BBC man Michael Cole, who was also communications director for Harrods,
is one of the neighbours against the proposal.

Locals Mark Tinney (right) and Tom Knox (left) have spoken out against Mr Standley's plans, labelling the proposed turbine a 'monstrosity'

He said: ‘This thing 
will be as high as the church tower and it has got nothing at all to do 
with green energy, reducing emissions or saving the planet – it is just 
about money.

‘Mr Standley 
will make money from selling his expensive power and we will all 
indirectly contribute towards his income by paying green charges on our 
electricity bills.

‘The 
Government accept that wind turbines are a blight, because they grant 
council tax discounts to people unfortunate enough to own properties 
near wind turbines.’

Local 
farrier Tom Knox added: ‘I have lived here for more than half a 
century … there is nowhere else like it in the world but now my house 
will be in direct sight of these ugly monstrosities.’

Wind turbine owners get paid for the 
electricity generated even if they use it themselves. Any excess is 
exported to the local grid – which they are also paid for.

Tariffs 
reward turbine owners with around 22p for each kWh of electricity 
generated and each kWh exported. A well-sited 6kW turbine can generate 
around 10,000kWh a year, but Mr Standley’s is far bigger.

Yesterday
he defended his plans on environmental grounds, saying: ‘I believe 
strongly in renewable energy – we just cannot go on using fossil fuels 
because it is unsustainable and they pump CO2 into the air … 

'I have been
publicly vilified over my plan and there is a definite Nimby factor at 
work.’

Laxfield Parish 
Council voted six to one against the application to erect the turbine, 
which is expected to go before Mid Suffolk District Council before the 
end of the year.
