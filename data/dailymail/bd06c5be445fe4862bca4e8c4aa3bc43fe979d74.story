A ‘Twitter troll’ was today found guilty of bombarding a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note.

Peter Nunn, 33, admitted retweeting messages threatening to sexually assault Stella Creasy and branding her a ‘witch’ last summer but claimed in court that they were a joke.

The father launched his ‘campaign of hatred’ after the MP backed a high-profile bid by feminist Caroline Criado-Perez to keep a woman other than the Queen on a British banknote.

Part-time delivery driver Nunn, of Bristol, told the City of London Magistrates' Court that he was ‘satirising’ the Twitter backlash to the campaign and had no idea he was causing offence.

Among the messages he posted was one which read: ‘Best way to rape a witch, try and drown her first then just when she's gagging for air that's when you enter.’

Asked about why he posted it, the self-styled blogger said: ‘Purely in a joke. In the old days they tried to drown a witch - if she drowned she wasn't. It is just a joke.

‘It came into my mind at the time and I thought it was really, really funny. I couldn't imagine in my wildest dreams that anyone would think “He is going to come and drown me like a witch”.

‘The whole witch thing is obviously satirical, it is not cynical like the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) are claiming. I don't see that message as being menacing or offensive.

‘It is just humour, nothing more than that.’  He added: ‘You can call someone a bitch and that is offensive, but calling someone a witch is a bit less offensive.’

He said he thought he was writing a ‘good natured joke’ which was ‘in no way threatening’. He added: ‘I never really did make rape threats.

‘I did make some around this time because that is what the debate was about. But now I don't bother because I don't want to get arrested and I never wanted to offend anyone.

‘I wouldn't dream that Caroline or Stella would be offended by these messages. They are satire.’

Nunn, who lives with his partner and three-year-old daughter, admitted using a number of different Twitter accounts to retweet and post messages about the two women.

He also admitted retweeting another message from the @eatcreasynow account threatening to rape Miss Creasy.

But Nunn told the court he did not mean it to read like a threat - and was trying to show his support for the Walthamstow MP by retweeting the message because she had also retweeted it.

He said: ‘I just saw it as an incredible threat - not a legitimate threat. I was just passing it on to my Twitter followers to show them what was happening.

‘I would never incite someone to make threats to people or do something bad to someone. It's not in my nature. I was trying to support her, not say anything against her.’

And he admitted posting a message to Miss Perez telling her to treat threats to rape her as ‘a compliment’.

He added: ‘I realise now that rape threats aren't a compliment. I said you could take it as a compliment, you are beautiful.’

Nunn posted the messages last summer - at the height of publicity around the Austen campaign. Miss Creasy and Miss Perez both spoke publicly about the abuse they received online at the time.

And Nunn said he thought the ‘best way to approach the discussion was to scrutinise it by coming up with the idea of witches’.

He added: ‘I'm the first to condemn anyone. I don't agree with people sending rape threats - it is not something I would do myself. But at the same time I didn't think it was criminal.’

He accused Twitter users who spoke out against his messages of being radical feminists who ‘hate people’ and created ‘a nasty atmosphere’ online.

And he accused Twitter bosses of undermining his free speech by shutting down his accounts.

He said: ‘If I can make it clear that I didn't hate anyone because of this, I just found it a bit weird maybe a bit disturbing that my Twitter accounts kept getting banned. It felt like my free speech was being taken away and I didn't know why.’

He added: ‘I felt like I was being harassed myself at the time, which is ironic.’

Under cross-examination Nunn declared he is a ‘feminist’ and said he supported equal rights.

He made the comments as Alison Morgan, prosecuting, challenged him over why he branded Ms Perez a lesbian in a tweet and asked: ‘Are all feminists lesbians in your mind?’

Nunn replied: ‘No, not at all. A lot of them are men as well. I'm a feminist myself. I believe men and women are equal.’  He added: ‘I'm all for feminism - I think it's a good idea.’

Peter Nunn

The father admitted posting foul-mouthed blog posts ranting about ‘f****** women’ and tweeting that he would only rape Miss Perez if he was ‘drunk’ and using the hashtag of date rape drug Rohypnol.

The prosecutor said to Nunn: ‘It was a game for you - about how far you could take it. Freedom of speech, that's what you wanted to do here.’

She accused him of trying to get a laugh from ‘sad people’ on Twitter, adding: ‘You knew it was going to cause huge offence to these people. You hated this woman and you wanted to offend them.’

But Nunn insisted he did nothing wrong - and accused Miss Creasy and Miss Perez of stoking abuse on Twitter. He said: ‘I felt their actions were encouraging abuse on Twitter ... I didn't feel that they were personally getting bullied or menaced themselves.’

He added: ‘If I have caused any offence or menace I'm devastated by that.’  Nunn was arrested at his home on August 7 after Miss Creasy and Miss Criado-Perez reported his abuse.

Nunn, who wore a smart grey suit, white shirt and grey striped patterned tie, had denied sending indecent, obscene or menacing messages.between July 28 and August 5 last year.

But District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe found him guilty of this charge today.
