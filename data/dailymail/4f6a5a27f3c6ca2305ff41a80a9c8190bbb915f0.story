A Chinese couple have taken their adult stay-at-home son to court - in an attempt to force him to move out and get a job.

Xu Qing, 29, dropped out of university and moved in with his mother and father in Beijing after insisting he did not get on with his roommates.

But after his father Ku arranged for him to have a job at a friend's company, he walked out announcing that it was too boring.

Instead he settled in at his parents' house where he spent the day sleeping and surfing the internet - and eventually met a girl online.

At home his mother Xu Hsing cooked for him and washed his clothing.

And before long his jobless partner had moved in as well - prompting his parents to snap and said he would either have to get a job or move out.

When he again refused they said they had no choice other than to take him to court.

They did, and were successful after the court ruled that although Qing was their son, at the age of 29 they no longer had an obligation to support him and that as it was their house they could also force him to move out.

When he and his girlfriend refused to follow the court's 60 day deadline, the couple  applyied for an eviction notice to have bailiffs remove their son, his girlfriend and their property.

The case sparked a wave of comments byÂ Internet users in China.

'Having this kind of son is really pathetic. Just keep it in mind: Don't spoil kids,' one user said.

Another commented: 'It's just a mirror of today's education.'

'The parents have brought up such a spoiled prince,' one web user added. 'They actually asked for it!'
