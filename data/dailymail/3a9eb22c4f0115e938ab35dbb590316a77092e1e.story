Robin van Persie admits his form has been poor this season and says he does not know if Manchester United will keep him after his contract ends in 18 months.

Van Persie’s close relationship with Louis van Gaal was tested to the limit in the first half of the campaign and the United manager considered dropping him after a ‘very bad game’ against Arsenal in November.

The Holland striker’s form has improved since but he has scored only eight goals and missed one of the few chances United created in Friday’s goalless draw at Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round.

Van Persie, who fired United to the title with 26 Premier League goals after moving to Old Trafford for £24million in 2012, admits he can do much better and revealed that he is constantly questioning his contribution to the team.

He said: ‘This year I have played something like 20 games and I have scored eight goals – I am not happy with that. I want to score more. I will do everything, every day in training and during the games, I will keep doing what I have been doing for the last 10 years to make those goals.

‘Obviously we are not scoring enough goals, including me. I have to be honest. I think everyone in the team is responsible. Everyone feels responsible. I do definitely.

‘It is a very thin line between scoring a load of goals and only a couple. I know what I have to do to create those opportunities. I will keep doing that. At the moment, it is not enough. I know that. I will do everything I can to improve that.

‘In my last couple of games I didn't score. Can I really blame myself for that? I am always asking myself that question.

‘Even in games against Cambridge and top games, how many chances do strikers get. One? Two? So you have to take them.

‘Sometimes it is a thin line between winning 1-0, 2-0, 3-0 or drawing or losing because it is just based on those little chances. We could have won 4-2, 3-1, 3-0 against Cambridge. Then we would be having a different conversation.

‘Against Cambridge, I don’t think I can blame (Angel) di Maria for the great pass or blame myself for the way I hit it.

‘Against Spurs, there was that ball from (Michael) Carrick and I had one touch, another touch and another. I went to finish with my right leg. Normally, nine out of 10 keepers will make a move and it will be a goal. But not that day. If I scored that goal we would have won the game.

‘But I’m convinced that if we keep doing what we are doing, because we do create chances, if the strikers just take those chances I think we have a chance.’

Van Persie will turn 32 in August and is out of contract at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016. United have yet to open talks over a new deal and he admits that the situation is out of his hands.

Van Persie revealed he has been disappointed with his form this season and is unsure about his future 

Van Persie is convinced United will be able to adapt to Van Gaal's tactical philosophy in the long haul  

‘It is not up to me,’ he said. ‘For the moment I am staying here for 18 months. That is it really. I can’t look into the future. I don’t know what is going to happen after that. We shall have to wait and see.’ 

United have struggled to adapt to Van Gaal’s tactics at times this season, notably his preference for playing a three-man defence. It has led to some insipid performances but they remain on course for his primary objective of Champions League qualification and Van Persie is convinced it will come right in time.

‘I have known him for over two years now,’ he added. ‘I know how he works. We believe in him. Everyone has his own thing to do. Him and his coaching staff and we as players. We are trying everything we can to win games, not only win games but win them in a nice way as well. That is a process. In that process we have to be honest. We have to give everything we can.

‘Our belief is there and also with the players who have been working with him only for six months. Everyone believes in ourselves, our team-mates and our staff. We are confident it will change.

‘In the last 15 games, if I am correct, we are one of the best teams regarding results. So we are having a good run. Of course, games against Cambridge don't really help because for the picture of everyone in the world, we should have won four or five nil. It depends whether or not the ball falls for us. But we have to create our own luck and work even harder.’

Van Persie also that the United players were down about Friday’s surprise draw at the Abbey Stadium, but soon perked up when they saw Manchester City and Chelsea crash out to lower league clubs.

‘After the game against Cambridge, everyone was a little bit down,’ he said. ‘Although they played well so from their point of view, you have to be honest, you have to give them credit because it is quite a stunt what they did. It was very nice for them.

‘But in a way on Saturday the whole mood changed. City were out. Chelsea were out and suddenly we are in it with a home tie against Cambridge. And the so-called big clubs, it is just us, Arsenal, Liverpool and West Ham but we are the highest left in the competition. So does that make us favourite? I don't know. But I am very happy that we are in it.

‘It has been 11 years since United won the FA Cup last. Since I am here that was actually the first thing that Sir Alex Ferguson said as well. He said “I want to win that cup”. I think we have a big chance this year. We want to win it. But again we have to look at the first game only because that is the next game against Cambridge.'

Real Madrid's new teenage signing Martin Odegaard was presented at Valdebebas training ground last week

Meanwhile, the chances of United goalkeeper David de Gea moving to Real Madrid in the summer receded on Monday as FIFA launched an investigation into their signing of under-age players that could see them incur a transfer ban.

Barcelona have been banned from signing players in 2015 and Real have now been asked to provide the game’s governing body with documentation for around 60 boys signed by the club since 2009, on the suspicion that they have broken the same rules.

De Gea’s agent Jorge Mendes admitted last week that his client could end up at the Bernabeu Stadium, but a transfer ban would put an end to that move.

Real are also one of several clubs hopeful of signing Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus at the end of the season and their removal from the 2015 transfer market would drastically alter the prospects of an English club landing the midfielder. 

The ban could scupper Madrid's reported transfer bid for Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea

Club official Emilio Butragueno said Real are not worried about the investigation, which focuses on two 12-year-olds brought to Madrid from Venezuela in 2012.

Manuel Godoy and Fernando Macias were on a tour of trials with big clubs but before they could reach River Plate and Inter Milan, Madrid snapped them up.

Real’s defence centres on an insistence that neither youngster played for the club. There is also a suggestion that Godoy was withdrawn in 2013 when the club were alerted to the possibility that they had broken the rules, while Macias has since moved to Rayo Vallecano.

Madrid have filed all relevant documentation and believe it will show they have not contravened the rule which allows the signing of under 18s from outside the EU only if the player’s parents have had to relocate to the country where the club is based, for non-football reasons.
