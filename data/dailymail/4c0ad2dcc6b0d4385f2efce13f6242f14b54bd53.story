Andy Murray has unveiled his new personal logo, which he will display for the first time at the Australian Open next week.

The design will feature on Murray's on-court bag and training T-shirts in Melbourne.

The world No 6 hired Aesop Agency to come up with the logo, which combines his initials with the number 77.

Andy Murray's new logo incorporates his initials AM and the number 77 - a reference to his Wimbledon title

The logo will make its first appearance at the Australian Open, which starts next week 

Roger Federer - Like Murray, the tennis star also has his own logo (RF).

Gareth Bale - In 2013 Bale successfully applied for intellectual property rights to his '11 of hearts' trademark celebration. 

Cristiano Ronaldo - The Ballon d'or winner has brought out and entire fashion range under his CR7 logo. 

Murray became the first British man in 77 years to win the Wimbledon singles title in 2013, and it is the name of the management company he set up following his second grand slam victory.

The launch of the logo follows Murray's switch of clothing sponsor from adidas to Under Armour.

Dan Calderwood, design director at Aesop, said: 'We wanted to create a modern mark that captures Andy's energy and spirit whilst subtly referencing his affinity with the number 77.

'It's simple and striking, with heraldic cues that echo his dominance on the court.'

Roger Federer already has his own logo, pictured here on his T-Shirt while he trains

Murray follows in the footsteps of a number of players, most famously Roger Federer, whose RF logo is ubiquitous at tennis events.

Meanwhile, it was announced on Thursday that Murray will join Federer and world No 1 Novak Djokovic at next month's Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.

The Scot lost to Federer in the final in 2012 on his most recent appearance at the tournament, which begins on February 23.
