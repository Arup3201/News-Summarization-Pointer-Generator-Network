A pet food company has become the first in the world to introduce traffic light labels on its packaging in a bid to stop pet obesity.

Tribal Pet Foods, based in London, is incorporating the warning system on the front of their packaging, which outlines the fat and fibre content of the food as well as the calories.

It comes after a study earlier this year revealed that there are around 2.5 million dogs in Britain that are classed as overweight, with some owners even feeding their pets fast food, leftovers, crisps, chocolate and chips.

The new traffic light style labelling, which is being added to pet food made by the company Tribal Pet Foods, in a bid to help stop pet obesity 

The traffic light labelling that is used on human food, which shows the fat, calorie, sat and sugar content of the product 

The traffic light warnings uses the colours red, amber and green to show how healthy the food is for the dog.

Red indicates that the food is bad for dogs, amber that it is slightly above or below the ideal range, while green indicates it contains the ideal range of nutrients.

The labels mirror the warnings that are already featured on human food, which shows how much fat, saturated fat, salt, sugar and calories it contains.

All major supermarkets are signed up to the scheme and along with various well-known manufacturers.

A spokesman for Tribal Pet Food said: 'Pet food labelling can often be complex, and it's not always easy to know which choice is best for your dog.

'That's what why Tribal Pet Foods have become the first pet food company in the world to introduce a comprehensive traffic light label on each pack, just as we have for our own food.'

According to the PDSA, there are more than 10 million pets who regularly receive fatty treats, due to owners sharing their own unhealthy eating habits in a well-intentioned but misguided attempt to make them happy.

The study also found that 87 per cent of owners give their pets treats, even though 91 per cent realise obesity can reduce their pet's lifespan.

Elaine Pendlebury, PDSA senior veterinary surgeon, said: 'Obesity is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting pets in the UK today.

'Sadly, it also means millions of pets are at risk from potentially life-threatening health problems related to obesity.

'But the good news is that obesity is entirely reversible. With veterinary advice and guidance and it is never too late to try and improve a pet’s quality of life by tackling weight problems.'
