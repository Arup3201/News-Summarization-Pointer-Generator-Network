Apple announced that it's newest Mac Pro Desktop Computer called The Mac Pro Tower will be available in stores starting tomorrow. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO of the Cupertino, California based company said that the computer will be available in stores and on the website for $2,999. Another version with better specs is available for $3,999. There will also be a number of custom options that may bring up the price. ABC news reports that the only accessory the Mac Pro comes with is a power cord. Monitors, speakers, a keyboard, and a mouse will cost extra. The computer which is black and sleek has been likened to 'Darth Vader.' It stands a little less than 10 inches tall and is cylindrical in shape. The design funnels air through the top of the opening of the black aluminum cylinder to keep the computer from overheating. It weighs a total of 11 pounds. Unlike other apple products, the New Mac pro was made in the US, not in China.

The new Mac Pro Tower is 10 times faster than conventional computers and is targeted towards creative professionals

Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the New Mac Pro computer, the first real innovation since Steve Job's death, will be available online and in stores tomorrow

The computer is equipped with an Intel Xeon EF Processor, 256GB of PCle-based flash storage, 12 GB of memory, and dual AMD FirePro graphics processors. It's smaller than the older version and holds six Thunderbolt 2 ports in addition to for USB 3.0 connections in the back. It's also 10 times faster than any other conventional computer, reports BGR.com

The new Mac Pro was first introduced in June at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). This is the first extremely different Mac product introduced following Mac Founder Steve Job's death in October, 2011.

'Can't innovate anymore, my a%$,'said the head of Apple Marketing Philip Schiller during his keynote speech at WWDC. He was addressing criticism from industry and financial analysts that Apple hadn't come out with any new cutting edge products since Job's death, reported computerworld.com.

The last time Apple introduced a new 
Mac Pro model was in 2010. In 2012, Apple slightly changed the hardware.
 The long period between new Mac models lead some to believe that Apple 
was going to get rid of the Mac Pro all together.They were wrong.

The
 Mac Pro is targeted towards creative professionals such as designers, 
developers, and engineers, and sells much less than Apple's other 
computers such as the MacBook and the IMac desktop.

The cylindrical shape allows air to escape from the top to keep the computer from overheating

In an interview with computerworld.com in November, Craig Seeman, owner of Third Planet Video, a video production company in Brooklyn, New York, said that he would be switching to the new Macpro.

'The smaller design is much more space efficient. This is of major importance to those of us who work in small and often crowded offices,' Seeman said.

Despite the Mac Pro's innovative new design, Computerworld.com reports that Apple is actually primarialy a smartphone company. Apple even erased the word 'Computer' from its official name in 2007. The most recent reported Mac revenue was $5.6 billion dollars. The Smartphone topped Apple's revenue at $19.5 billion.
