When the hot summer months arrive, most people dream of having a big pool in their garden to splash around in - and Mila the hippopotamus is no different

The female resident of Kaliningrad zoo, in west Russia, recently broke out of her enclosure in search of greener pastures - after going months without a working waterhole.

The 14-year-old mammal was eventually caught staring longingly into the elephant enclosure where her neighbour enjoys a luxurious deep plunge pool.

Not impressed: Mila, the 14-year-old hippopotamus broke out of her enclosure in search of a pool after overheating in the summer heat

Zookeeper, Uliana Nekrasova, said: 'There have been some problems with her own pool which has been out of action for most of the summer. 

'We have a hose and we do our best but the main plunge pool is out of action.'

Keepers realised she was missing when they went to her enclosure at feeding time and found it empty, but they have insisted there was no danger to the public.

A zoo spokesman said: 'Mila was found only 100 metres from her own enclosure and she is normally a very sweet-natured animal.

'She wasn't being aggressive. She was just curious and took her chance to look around.'

Jealous: The female hippo was found by keeper, Uliana Nekrasova, looking longingly at the elephant's plunge pool at the Kaliningrad zoo in west Russia

Belly flop: Mila's pool is currently being fixed meaning she will be able to cool down in the comfort of her her own enclosure

'We are tackling problems with her own enclosure so she won't need to go walkabout again.'

Hippopotamuses love water, which is why the Greeks named them the 'river horse'. 

In Africa, they spend up to 16 hours a day submerged in rivers and lakes to keep their massive bodies cool. 

The mammals can also be dangerous and unpredictable when disturbed, and are responsible for more deaths in Africa than any other animal.
