A mysterious defendant in a $100 million, cross-country Navy veterans charity fraud case was convicted today of racketeering, theft, money laundering and other charges.

The jury in Cleveland, Ohio, which deliberated for about three hours yesterday, heard nothing from the ex-fugitive, 'Bobby Thompson', who changed his mind and decided against testifying.

His attorney said the 67-year-old wanted to tell his story but worried about his mental state if he faced aggressive cross-examination by prosecutors.

The defendant identifies himself as Bobby Thompson, but authorities say he's Harvard-trained attorney John Donald Cody.

He was indicted in 2010, disappeared for nearly two years and was arrested last year in Portland, Oregon.

He was charged with looting the United States Navy Veterans Association, a charity he ran in Tampa, Florida.

As his five-week trial wound down before closing arguments on Tuesday, he had appeared disheveled in court, so much so that the judge suggested a break to allow him to get a clean shirt and comb his hair.

His attorney, Joseph Patituce, noted during a break in the trial that the defendant had bloodied himself last week while pounding his head against the wall in a holding cell.

The judge said the defendant was checked by the jail medical staff.

Authorities believe he defrauded donors of up to $100 million in 41 states. A fraction of that money was found.

When he was arrested, authorities found fake IDs and a suitcase with $980,000 in cash.

Records show the defendant had showered politicians, often Republicans, with political donations.

The judge rejected a defense request to subpoena testimony from leading Ohio Republicans, including U.S. House Speaker John Boehner.

Authorities said they traced the name Bobby Thompson to a man who wasn't connected to the charity case and had his identity stolen, including his Social Security number and date of birth.

The defendant was identified through military fingerprint records.

There was no requirement for him to testify on Tuesday, but the judge asked to hear from the defendant directly.

‘Mr Thompson,’ Judge Steven Gall said, raising his voice to repeat what he called ‘a simple question’ on whether he would testify.

He had entered court with his shirt unbuttoned to the waist, his baggy pants bunched around his ankles and his hair disheveled.

‘I would like to put myself in physical appearance I think is reasonable,’ the defendant said without specifying if he would testify as the defense had signaled.

The defendant returned from a judge-ordered break 
and his attorney, Joseph Patituce, told the judge that the defense would
rest without testimony from his client.

Politicians
who received donations from him, according to campaign finance filings,
include former President George W. Bush and former presidential 
contenders Mitt Romney, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani.

Ohio
Attorney General Mike DeWine, whose office handled the trial 
prosecution, said he believes that photos the defendant had taken with 
high-profile Republicans such as Bush, Boehner and GOP strategist Karl 
Rove were used to soften up potential donors.

Besides
Boehner, political donations went to almost every member of the state’s
GOP congressional delegation and two of DeWine’s predecessors as 
attorney general.

Authorities said the defendant used his VIP political connections to encourage donors to give to his charity.

While
on the run, investigators tracked him through Arizona, Florida, 
Indiana, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington and West Virginia.

Cody had a prestigious educational background, with a 
degree from the University of Virginia (UVA) and a law degree from 
Harvard.

He
had been a U.S. Army Captain in Military Intelligence and previously 
practiced law in Sierra Vista, Arizona from 1980 to 1984. 

During
his law career in Arizona, he became the subject of an investigation 
over claims he was stealing money from his clients but Cody skipped town
before he could be apprehended and since 1987 had been a fugitive from 
the FBI.

According to a federal warrant, dated May 4, 1987, out of the Eastern 
District of Virginia, Cody is charged with interstate transportation of 
fraudulent traveler’s checks from probate estates’ bank accounts, false 
statements to an investment brokerage firm, and false statements on loan
applications.

A
former colleague, Dennis Lusk, now chief judge of the Arizona Motor 
Vehicle Division, had worked with Cody in Arizona and remembered him as 
bizarre.

Wanted: The FBI has been searching for John Donald Cody since 1987

He described the attorney as 'intelligent enough to get through Harvard Law School and was a great talker and BS-er,' in an interview with the Arizona Republic in 2002.

His non-profit group boasted a membership of more than 
66,000 members in 40 states but little of the money raised ever made its
way to assist military service members.

Law enforcement officials began investigating Cody and he was charged with multiple counts of fraud in 2010.

Once again, he abandoned his identity and set off on a cross-country 
journey using numerous aliases to evade police.

From June 2010 to May 2012, investigators believe he hid out in Massachusetts, Arizona, New 
Mexico Rhode Island, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Washington and ultimately Portland, Oregon - where he was finally caught.

He
was arrested at a boarding house where he had rented a room, and 
investigators say one of the few belongings they found was a DVD of 
Catch Me If You Can, the Leonardo DiCaprio drama chronicling the wild 
history of convicted conman Frank Abagnale.
