Police have named the five people found dead at a Georgia home on Saturday, while they continue to seek missing Thomas Jesse Lee, 26, who has been named by police as a ‘person of interest’ in the case.

The dead included his wife Christie Lee, 33, her daughter Bailey Burtron, 16, her parents William Burtron, 69; and Sheila Burtron, 68, and family friend Iiaonna Green, 18, who’d only recently moved into the La Grange home.

The bodies of four females and one male were found inside the LaGrange home shortly after 10 p.m. on Saturday.

Police are seeking Thomas Lee, right, after they discovered five dead bodies at a Georgia home on Saturday night including Lee's wife Christie, center, and her daughter Bailey 

The dead also included Christie Lee's parents Shelia Burtron, 68, and William Burtron, 69

The bodies were discovered after someone called 911, asking for deputies to check on the home's occupants, said Troup County sheriff's Sgt. Stewart Smith.

The 911 caller reported that he hadn't seen anyone come or go from the home in a while, Smith said.

The bodies were discovered after the employer of one of the victims called 911 and said the man had not shown up for work for several days, Woodruff said.

Troup County Sheriff James Woodruff speculated the slayings may have occurred on Wednesday, although the victims’ bodies would need to be transported to the state medical examiner’s office for autopsy to determine the exact time of death.

After finding all the exterior doors locked, deputies used a breach kit to enter the home through a rear door. What they found was a grisly scene throughout the entire home, Woodruff said.

Police say the bodies were found in different rooms in the home, report WSBTV. Four of them had been shot, according to police.

'In law enforcement, you see bad things every day,' Woodruff told The LaGrange Daily News. 'But I've never seen a crime scene like this in my 25 years or so in law enforcement — never a scene with five victims inside a home.’

The home is about 80 miles southwest of Atlanta, just east of the Alabama state line.

Sgt. Stewart Smith, with the Troup County Sheriff's Office, said of Lee: 'He is not here at the home and we understand there may have been a dispute or something between one of the victims here.

'We have not been able to make contact with him at all.

Police have named Lee as a ‘person of interest’ in the murder case. The other victim was family friend Iiaonna Green, 18, who’d only recently moved into the La Grange home

'We're doing any tracks we can on the cell phone, any internet searches, social media searches for him and kind of coming up with a dead end right now.

'Definitely if anyone knows anything about him, please call the sheriff's office or our crimestopper's number.'

Lee is described as a white male, blue eyes, about 6-foot-3, and 190 pounds,

He may be driving an olive green Mazda Tribute with Georgia license plate number BRN0785.

The home is in LaGrange, a small city about 80 miles southwest of Atlanta and just east of the Alabama state line.
