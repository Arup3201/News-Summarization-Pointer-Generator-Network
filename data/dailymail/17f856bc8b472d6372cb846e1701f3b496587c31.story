Celtic’s return to the summit of the Scottish Premiership will surprise no one. A Mikael Lustig hat-trick might have been a different story.

The Swedish defender is not noted for his goalscoring. In a season blighted by injury for the most part he hasn’t been noted for very much at all.

Yet, on his return from injury for a first appearance since November, the half-time substitute eased his way back in with two goals in seven minutes – one a diving header – and came to within inches of adding a third.

The woodwork proved Motherwell’s salvation more than once here.

With Celtic 2-0 up at half-time it prevented the home team from making a very comfortable victory a rout.

Lustig turned a James Forrest centre into the net with a slightly mis-hit left foot shot in 75 minutes. He added his second with a spectacular looping, diving header from 10 yards from a Leigh Griffiths cross.

Had he added a third we might all have been calling Tommy Gemmell, the club’s last free-scoring full-back, for a comment.

As it turned out, a low Kris Commons centre in the final minutes was turned against the upright from 12 yards. The statisticians could rest easy. More so, at least, than a Motherwell team tormented here from start to finish.

Anthony Stokes divides opinion. The Irishman has admirers in Cardiff and Leeds and has been linked with both English Championship clubs this month already.

They don’t seem so sure about him in the Celtic support. Yet after three weeks on the sidelines he was the first Celtic returnee to remind doubters what he brings to Ronny Deila’s team.

In the 4-2-3-1 formation favoured by the Norwegian, Stokes is forging a new role as a creator on the left side. It’s not clear he fancies his new role much. Yet two first half assists in this routine, mundane victory suggest he won’t be back in his favoured berth as an out and out poacher again any time soon.

When his corner struck the first defender in 26 minutes they howled their derision. In response Stokes gathered the ball in and thumped a probing ball to the back post where Virgil van Dijk headed the opener into the roof of the net.

Like Stokes, Van Dijk is another of the wanted men. The attraction of selling now for a £10million fee is obvious. But it’s not only defending which makes Deila determined to stick. Scoring his seventh of the season the centre-half became Celtic’s third highest goalscorer after John Guidetti and Anthony Stokes.

Leigh Griffiths might feature in the upper reaches soon enough. He headed a fine goal two minutes from half-time. A quick free-kick from Nir Bitton sent Stokes scuttling down the left flank. The cross which prompted Griffiths to crane back his neck and guide the ball into the net for 2-0 was quality.

At half-time it was a question of how many Celtic wanted. Seeking to overhaul Aberdeen at the top of the table – with a game in hand – the response was empatic.

Motherwell entered this match on a run of three straight defeats. After winning their opening two matches under Ian Barraclough the Fir Park side arrived in Glasgow’s east end knowing they could drop into the bottom two if they lost and St Mirren won.

In the event the Paisley side fell short. But so did Motherwell here and by some distance.

It may have been a lack of ambition, more likely a lack of ability and experience, with captain Keith Lasley absent with a broken toe. Despite the return of Stephen Pearson to a claret shirt, however, the Steelmen barely mustered a venture over the halfway line. Pearson did loft a deft cross towards the back post on the half hour which nearly dropped inside the post. Yet Celtic – with Kris Commons in the starting line-up again – had a spring in their step. 

Throwing his boots to the crowd in Hamilton at the weekend Commons created a few headlines as he gave impression he was off. Wrongly. They found him a new pair last night, but almost sent out a call for the old pair when he lashed an early effort from a Stokes lay-off high and wide.

A minute's silence is observed before the game at Celtic Park in remembrance of fan Martin Kane 

He blew a later chance for 3-0 after an hour, sidefooting an easy chance from a Griffiths centre too close to keeper Dan Twardzik, then hammered a right foot shot straight at the keeper moments later. If last year’s player of the year finally signs a new contract – and it looks unlikely – this won’t be the night which seals it.

He was by no means a solitary offender in the art of wasting great chances. Celtic should probably have finished the night with six.

Greig Thomas, Motherwell’s lively teenage substitute at half-time, threatened the briefest of revivals when he thumped a fine chance into the side-netting in 49 minutes from 16 yards. But it was an illusion. A false new dawn.

Craig Gordon still toiled to stay warm as Celtic resumed normal service.

Stefan Johansen – taken off with Motherwell’s Mark O’Brien after a clash of heads – struck the inside of the post with a stooping header from an Emilio Izaguirre cross to the back post in 58 minutes.

Three minutes later the Honduran left-back achieved a staggering miss when he lashed a Leigh Griffiths squared ball against the face of the bar from six yards. Falling to the ground, slapping the turf, his disbelief was shared by many.

In Lustig Celtic had one defender, at least, who had his eye in. He took his goals in some style as some key performers returned from injury a mere 10 days before an Old Firm game. Sheer coincidence of course.
