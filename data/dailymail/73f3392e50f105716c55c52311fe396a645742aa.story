Earth's 'twin', Venus, is now a barren world with a crushing atmosphere, acid raining from its skies and blistering temperatures of 480°C (890 °F).

But scientists believe this hellish planet may once have had enough water in its atmosphere to cover its surface in an ocean 80ft (25 metres) deep.

While the planet was too warm for that water to have fallen as rain, a new study suggests Venus may instead have had huge oceans of supercritical CO2, which were recently found to be capable of harbouring life.

Hellish planet: While Venus was too warm for water to have fallen as rain, a new study suggests the now barren world (pictured) may have had huge oceans of supercritical CO2. Supercritical CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a fluid

'Presently, the atmosphere of Venus is mostly carbon dioxide, 96.5 per cent by volume,' lead study author Dima Bolmatov, a theoretical physicist at Cornell University told Space.com.

Supercritical CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas.

Supercritical CO2 is created when liquids and gases reach their temperature and pressure thresholds, creating a supercritical fluid that has features of both a liquid and gas.

Carbon dioxide becomes supercritical when its temperature exceeds 305 degrees Kelvin (32°C) and its pressure goes beyond 72.9 - the standard atmosphere at sea level.

On Earth, it's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment. 

A recent study claimed it could also be capable of sustaining life on planets without water, such as Venus. 

Scientists had previously thought the physical properties of supercritical fluids changed slowly with pressure and temperature. 

But computer simulations by Professor Bolmatov found this wasn't the case.

The huge atmospheric pressures on Venus in its early days may have caused the supercritical carbon dioxide to look like soap bubbles, or as Professor Bolmatov puts it: 'A bubble of gas that is covered by a thick layer of liquid.'

'This in turn makes it plausible that geological features on Venus - like rift valleys, river-like beds, and plains - are the fingerprints of near-surface activity of liquid-like supercritical carbon dioxide,' Professor Bolmatov told Space.com.

The discovery follows a study in November that found life could thrive in planet's that contain supercritical CO2.

Professor Dirk Schulze-Makuch at Washington University compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water, and found that they were more stable in supercritical CO2. 

A study earlier this year argued that bacteria (pictured) could exist on planets that contain a 'supercritical' CO2.  If Venus did contain oceans of supercritical CO2, the planet may contain remnants of life

Supercritical carbon dioxide makes enzymes choosier about the molecules they bind to, leading to fewer side reactions.

They also found that a number of species of bacteria are tolerant of supercritical carbon dioxide.

Previous studies have found that microbes can live near liquid carbon dioxide trapped under Earth's oceans – and area where the fluid can become supercritical.

If Venus did contain oceans of supercritical CO2, the planet may contain remnants of life.
