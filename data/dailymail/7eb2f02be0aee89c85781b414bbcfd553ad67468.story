He is known for his boundless enthusiasm and perky manner... but we’re all entitled to have an off-day.

Graham Norton’s busy TV and radio schedule – and perhaps a busy party season over Christmas – looked as if it was taking its toll as he left BBC studios in London earlier this week.

As well as sporting ruffled hair and grey stubble, the usually chirpy Irishman’s eye bags – which he has previously said are ‘hideous’ – were more pronounced than usual. 

Rough night? The usually perky presenter looked rumpled as he left BBC studios in London

The 49-year-old Bafta-winning star, who hosts the Graham Norton Show on BBC1 and a Saturday slot on Radio 2, admitted he considered cosmetic surgery on his eyes but was too nervous.

He said: ‘I must admit I’ve considered it. I went to see a man about my eye bags, which even I think are hideous.

‘But
every time I had an appointment something would come up. In the end I 
took it as a sign that maybe it’s not meant to happen. Maybe I’ve grown 
into them.’

He added: ‘What stops me is fear, because it doesn’t 
matter how much you spend, there are no guarantees on how it will turn 
out and no way to reverse your error of judgment. I prefer looking 
haggard.’

Perky: The TV and radio star has confessed to considering cosmetic surgery in the past

Mr Norton had just finished recording his weekly Radio 2 chat show, which airs from 10am until 1pm, when he was pictured.

He has hosted the programme - a mix of celebrity interviews and music  - since Jonathan Ross left the BBC in 2010.

In August, the Irish presenter sold his production company So TV to ITV for £10million, with an extra £7million promised if its revenues hit a series of targets by 2016.

He is one of the BBC’s most highly paid stars, and is thought to earn at least £1.5million a year under his current contract with the corporation.

Mr Norton lives in London’s Docklands with his boyfriend Trevor Patterson and owns homes in  New York, Sussex and Ireland.

The presenter has admitted suffering a ‘crisis’ on turning 40, but said he was relaxed about the prospect of turning 50 in April.

He said: ‘I genuinely feel OK about turning 50. Forty freaked me out. I didn’t see it coming. My life was in a state of chaos – I was moving jobs and moving house – and it just hit me like a ton of bricks.

‘Whereas right now I feel very settled. I’ve got a few jobs that I love, I really like where I live, I’ve got the dogs... It all feels very good. Fifty just feels like a bit more than forty.’
