Unrepentant: Joanne Caplis was ordered to carry out 80 hours unpaid work after a trial, but appeared to mock the sentence on Facebook

A shameless thief who stole from a charity publicly mocked the soft sentence she was given on Facebook.

Shopworker Joanne Caplis, 43, was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work for taking £50 from Shopmobility which provides scooters for disabled clients.

But within hours of leaving court she posted on her profile: '80 hours community service ha bloody ha.'

Caplis - who still protests her innocence - then used offensive language to describe her former employer.

She defiantly refused to apologise today and claimed she was poking fun at the system rather than scoffing at the leniency of her sentence.

She said: 'I am not sorry because I have not done anything wrong. I posted on Facebook "ha bloody ha" because I think it is ridiculous.'

Caplis, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, worked at the charity’s branch in Wigan where bosses spotted irregularities with the accounts.

She pleaded not guilty to fraud by altering banking spreadsheets but was found guilty of the two charges at Wigan Magistrates Court.

She was given a community order and told to pay £50 compensation with a £60 victim surcharge.

David Eccles, general manager of Shopmobility, said: 'I have known Joanne for more than 15 years.

'She was a volunteer and then became a part-time paid employee.

'We noticed the inaccuracies by chance and found proof she stole £50. We all knew it could only be one person who could have done it.

Today Caplis insisted she was innocent and was making fun of the system that found her guilty rather than scoffing at the leniency of her sentence

'There was only one paid employee who did the banking on those particular days. We sacked her on the spot and her reaction was disbelief.

'We feel really disappointed and hurt that someone we trusted had done this. Our clients - people from Wigan and Leigh - trusted her. They were all friends and she has let us all down.

'We don’t have a lot of cash and we are struggling. In a week we probably take between £200 and £300, so taking money makes it even harder.'

Caplis claimed: 'I never hid anything from anyone. I went to see a solicitor about the way bosses sacked me, as they did not follow protocol.

'The only reason there is no tribunal is because I couldn’t afford it.

'I feel so angry about it. I have been there 18 years and my former partner, Gary Kay, who is the father of my son, was the chairman there before he died 11 years ago, aged 53.

'We did quite a bit of fund-raising.'
