The mother of a baby girl who died from whooping cough claims she was not offered a simple vaccine available to pregnant mothers which can protect newborns from the disease.

Five-week-old Violet Herdman, died on May 1, after being rushed to hospital as she struggled to breathe.

Her parents Emma Sharp, 33, and Colin Herdman, 34, claim doctors failed to spot the signs of whooping cough in time to save their daughter.

The couple, from Morpeth in Northumberland, said despite Violet's lips turning blue as she gasped for breath, medics at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust missed opportunities to diagnose her condition.

Five-week-old Violet Herdman died on May 1 after being diagnosed with whooping cough. Her parents Emma Sharp and Colin Herdman are urging all pregnant women to make sure they are vaccinated against the disease, after claiming Ms Sharp was not offered the jab while pregnant with their daughter

They said Violet was diagnosed as having a chest infection, and was discharged a day after being admitted for tests.

Sales assistant Ms Sharp said despite regular antenatal appointments she was not offered the whooping cough vaccine.

She and her partner today urged other pregnant women to learn about the vaccine and to insist on having the jab, to try and help prevent other families face a similar ordeal.

The Department of Health launched a vaccination programme advising all expectant mothers are offered the jab, after a surge in cases during 2012.

The NHS Choices website states: 
'You may be offered the vaccination at a routine antenatal appointment 
when you are between 28 and 38 weeks pregnant.

'If you are over 28 
weeks pregnant and have not been offered the vaccine, talk to your 
midwife or GP and make an appointment to get vaccinated.'

Violet was born premature at 33 weeks on March 26 at Wansbeck Hospital.

Despite struggling to feed the newborn was discharged 10 days later, with a clean bill of health.

But within weeks her parents became concerned when their daughter lost interest in feeding, and appeared to be struggling to breathe.

She was admitted to North Tyneside Hospital on April 27 for tests.

Her parents claim staff discharged her a day later, telling them their daughter had a chest infection.

Violet's condition deteriorated, and the next day Ms Sharp had to resuscitate her at home in front of her other children.

The couple returned to the hospital and claim they were told Violet may have pneumonia.

She was transferred to the Great North Children's Hospital in Newcastle, where she was put on a ventilator.

An investigation has been launched by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, after Ms Sharp and Mr Heldman claim doctors missed opportunities to diagnose Violet's condition

Ms Sharp said it was when her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest - thought to have been caused by a blood infection - that she and her partner were told their daughter had whooping cough.

By that time Ms Sharp said the couple were told nothing more could be done for Violet.

After having their daughter baptised in hospital, they took the devastating decision to switch off her life support.

Ms Sharp, who has four other children aged 22 months to 12, said: 'Violet’s death has left the entire family in pieces and at the moment it feels like every day is a struggle.

'We only had two weeks of her at home
 and I cannot help but think of all the things she missed out on – it’s 
absolutely heart breaking.

'She was a perfect baby, she slept well, fed well and had a lovely temperament.

'I knew there was something seriously 
wrong with Violet and never believed she should have been discharged 
from hospital when she had stopped breathing so many times, but the 
staff were adamant she was fine.

Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways.

The medical term for whooping cough is pertussis.

The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing.

These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the condition gets its name.

Other symptoms include a runny nose, raised temperature and vomiting after coughing.

The coughing can last for around three months.

In the UK, all pregnant women are offered vaccination against whooping cough when they are 28-38 weeks pregnant.

Getting vaccinated while you’re pregnant could help to protect your baby from developing whooping cough in its first few weeks of life. 

Children are vaccinated against whooping cough with the 5-in-1 vaccine at two, three and four months of age, and again with the 4-in-1 pre-school booster before starting school at the age of about three years and four months.

Whooping cough is a cyclical disease with the number of cases peaking every three to four years.

The numbers were high in 2012: in the first 10 months of the year, there were 7,728 reported cases in the UK, with 13 babies having died.

During the whole of 2011 there were only 910 cases in England and Wales.

'Having to resuscitate her at home in front of my children was absolutely horrendous and I’m sure will continue to affect us all for years to come.'

Ms Sharp, who said she had no knowledge the vaccine was available to pregnant woment, added: 'After Violet’s death I researched whooping cough and was shocked to discover that all pregnant women should be vaccinated.

'I learnt that the best time to get the injection was between 28 and 32 weeks and with Violet being born at over 33 weeks I cannot understand why I slipped through the net.

'Two of my previous children have been premature so there was a chance Violet would also be premature.

'Before we can even begin to think about coming to terms with what has happened, Colin and I need answers about why I was not offered a vaccine and why no link was made between Violet’s symptoms and whooping cough.

'Nothing can turn back the clock for us but for Violet’s death not to be completely in vain we need reassurance that every NHS Trust provides vaccines for pregnant women and that staff are trained to recognise the condition so it can be treated appropriately.

'It’s too late for Violet but it might just help prevent another family going through the same hell as us.'

The government introduced a whooping cough, or pertussis, vaccination programme for pregnant women in 2012, in response to a rise in cases.

Public Health England guidelines say: 'It is important for all women to be offered the pertussis vaccine during each pregnancy whilst the temporary programme is in place.'

Following Violet’s death law firm Irwin Mitchell have launched an investigation into her death.

Medical law expert Michelle Armstrong, from Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This is a tragic case and Violet’s parents have been left devastated by her sudden death.

'Violet’s cause of death was found to be multi-organ failure and a lung infection caused by whooping cough.

'We will now begin investigations to discover why Emma did not receive a vaccine during pregnancy, as well as why it was not recognised that Violet’s symptoms of a cough and breathing difficulties were related to whooping cough which needed immediate treatment.'

A spokesperson for Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to extend our sincere condolences to Violet’s family for their tragic loss earlier this year.'

'We are in touch with Violet’s parents and are already fully investigating the circumstances surrounding their daughter’s death. 

'This investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further until we have completed this thorough investigation and shared the findings with Violet’s parents.'
