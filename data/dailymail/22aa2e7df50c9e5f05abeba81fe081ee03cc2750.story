Princess Eugenie dressed up in glamorous style for a date night with her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank last night.

Looking like a Hollywood movie star from the Golden Era of film, the 24-year-old Royal wore a black satin 1940s-style dress, wore her hair in retro waves and added a slash of bright red lipstick for a trip to Loulou's in Mayfair.

Emulating the ladylike glamour of the D-Day era, her frock featured a flattering V-neck wrap-style front with fitted waist and full, flared, knee-length skirt.

The youngest daughter of Sarah Duchess of York, Eugenie accessorised her look with a croc-effect emerald green box clutch bag, chunky cross strap black sandals with red soles and gold statement jewellery.

She wore matching red lipstick and her hair was brushed back away from her face, tucked behind her ears, and styled into retro curls from the mid lengths down.

Meanwhile Jack, a successful nightclub boss, looked dapper in a smart black suit with sky blue tie and crisp white shirt.

The stylish couple were pictured looking loved up as they exited the trendy London night spot holding hands late last night.

Earlier this week Eugenie was seen attending four events in just 12 hours.

The young royal began the day at a royal garden party at Buckingham Palace alongside the Duchess of Cambridge.

The busy Princess looked smart and 
chic in a summery white dress, which she teamed with strappy black 
sandals and a studded box clutch - again in a retro 1940s style.

She then dashed to an art gala in central London, followed by an intimate Justin Timberlake gig and then finished the night off at celebrity hotspot, Tonteria.

Eugenie's latest look comes days after Samantha Cameron was spotted out in a retro cut dress in white and red - the colours of the English flag.

She sported the patriotic look for a date night with her husband, the Prime Minister, at the Chiltern Firehouse, on the eve of the World Cup.

England will play their first game of the tournament on Saturday.
