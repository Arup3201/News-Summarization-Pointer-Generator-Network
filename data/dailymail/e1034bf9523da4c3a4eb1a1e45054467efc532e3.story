A driver was hurt when they skidded into a pole whilst trying to avoid protesters in Ferguson, Missouri in the first civilian casualty of the latest unrest.

The unidentified motorist was trying to get round the group of 125 protesters who were blocking the street when they had the accident - and was immediately surrounded.

The driver managed to get clear of his vehicle and was not seriously injured.

St Louis County police said that three people were arrested after the crowd shouted that they wanted to kill the white policeman who shot dead a black teenager on August 9.

The killing of Michael Brown sparked more than a week of violent protests and a militarized police response that raised deep questions over America's racial divide.

On Friday MailOnline witnessed racially charged incidents on the streets that suggest the mood this time around is taking an ugly turn.

At one point a black woman in her 30s who seemed to be one of organisers told the other protesters only to stop white motorists.

With two white women in a white car suck in front of her she shouted: ‘Don't stop these black people, you stop these white m************.’

When one of the women pointed to her child in in the car, she said: ‘I got a baby too. You killed one of mine.’

Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, is on edge as it waits for a Grand Jury to deliver its verdict on whether to indict officer Darren Wilson, 28, who shot dead Brown, 18.

The decision is expected any day now and on Monday Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency with 400 members of the National Guard expected to be deployed onto the streets.

Tensions are beginning to boil over and on Friday night a group of around 30 protesters marched up and down the street outside the Ferguson police station and blocked traffic.

St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said one of them had a bullhorn and was ‘yelling profanities that included that they wanted Ferguson Police Officer Wilson ‘dead’’.

Reporters had heard similar calls from the protesters the night before. 

The group then moved off to West Florissant Avenue, the scene of the unrest in August, where they swelled to around 160.

Schellman wrote in a statement: ‘During this demonstration, a motorist on West Florissant lost control of their vehicle and crashed into a light pole at the intersection.

‘Demonstrators converged on the vehicle and a disturbance was reported.’

Pictures posted on Twitter show that the front passenger side of the car hit the pole and that the passenger side airbag was deployed. The front of the vehicle was severely dented.

Jermell Hasson, one of the protesters, wrote on Twitter that the accident was the driver's fault.

He wrote: ‘Hit and run in west florissant. Was not cause by Ferguson protesters. Smh they kept going’.

The protesters later returned to the Ferguson police station where they blocked traffic again and three were arrested for unlawful assembly.

A spokesman for the Ferguson Fire Department said they were called to attend the incident with the driver but could not get the vehicle because of the protesters.

By the time the area was secure they had been informed they were not needed because the driver was 'not seriously injured', the spokesman added.
