Roger Federer has admitted that he would have found it difficult to continue playing tennis if he had been relegated from the show courts at major events.  

A very difficult 2013 had seen the 33-year-old written off by many, but a resurgence last season saw him end the year as world No 2, and he is now heading into 2015 as a real threat to add to his haul of 17 Grand Slam titles.

Despite his last major victory coming at Wimbledon in 2012, Federer remains one of tennis' biggest draws, and he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4 that it is the biggest stages that motivate him to remain at the highest level.

'I definitely am fortunate to always be playing on Centre Court and very often prime time,' he admitted.

'I must say - and this is honest - I don't know if I would still be playing if they put me on Court 4 every day.

'That would be difficult for me, having played on all these wonderful courts around the world and now playing in front of a fraction of those people - that would be rough.' 

Federer has won more major singles titles than any man in tennis history, and he said that he took inspiration from other legends of the sports world in order to defend his titles over and over again. 

Federer's last Grand Slam title came when he won his seventh Wimbledon title in 2012

'I realised very quickly that it's an entirely different thing winning something for the first time and then having to come back the following year and defend it,' he explained.

'Once I reached a certain level... I looked up to the great other athletes out there [for motivation], like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Valentino Rossi and Michael Schumacher - people who did it so long, so many times and make you wonder "How did they do that?".

'Next thing you know,' he continued, 'it's like you're part of that in a small way, and every year that goes by you get closer to those people. They were definitely a big inspiration for me to keep working hard.'
