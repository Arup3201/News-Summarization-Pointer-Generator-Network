Attack: The hacker was able to remove customer names, encrypted credit and debit card numbers, expiration dates and other information (stock image)

Adobe said a cyberattack on its systems has exposed credit-card information of 2.9 million customers.

The maker of Photoshop and other software said on Thursday that the attacker accessed Adobe customer IDs and passwords on its systems.

Through that, they were able to remove customer names, encrypted credit and debit card numbers, expiration dates and other information related to orders from customers worldwide. The company does not believe attackers removed credit and debit card numbers that weren't encrypted.

Adobe is notifying customers and resetting passwords. It has alerted banks processing Adobe payments to help protect customer accounts. It is also working with federal law enforcement on its related investigation.

'Cyber attacks are one of the unfortunate realities of doing business today,' Brad Arkin, Adobe's chief security officer, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. 'Given the profile and widespread use of many of our products, Adobe has attracted increasing attention from cyber attackers.'

The California-based company says it is also investigating illegal access to the source code of numerous Adobe products and believes the attacks are related.

Adobe shares fell 64 cents to close at $50.88 on Thursday and were unchanged in after-hours trading.

Chris Petersen, chief technology officer and co-founder of security specialist LogRhythm, said the incident was a ‘chilling reminder’ to all software companies.

He said: ‘When it comes to the source code breach, the first risk Adobe is concerned with is that malicious code was inserted into product source code and then distributed to customers in a compiled form.

‘The second risk is their source code being out in the open to would be attackers. Having access to product source code can allow attackers to identify software vulnerabilities that have been undiscovered to-date.

‘Both risks could result in a treasure trove of zero-day exploits against Adobe software. If indeed the source code stolen pertains to ColdFusion and Acrobat, this could leave thousands of web servers open to at-will compromise and make it easier to compromise end-user systems.

‘This breach is a chilling reminder that all software companies should be on guard, as they too could be a stepping stone to other targets.’

Tony Neate, CEO, Get Safe Online, said: 'Unfortunately these types of attacks do happen, despite how much companies do to protect confidential customer information.

'Adobe has been great at keeping affected customers updated by email, but we must be wary that criminals may decide to jump on the bandwagon and send emails posing as the company. It’s vital that we never respond with any of our personal information.'
