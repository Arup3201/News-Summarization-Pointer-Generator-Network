West Brom striker Saido Berahino is one player who won't have a problem representing the England Under 21s in a major tournament this summer - as a thank-you to the country that saved his life.

The attitude of young players towards the national team has been thrown into the spotlight again this week with Roy Hodgson revealing that Swansea City midfielder Jonjo Shelvey was "reticent" to play for the Under 21s, prompting a furious response from the team's former manager Stuart Pearce, who retorted: 'How the hell has he got a senior England call up then?' 

But Berahino, who has a great relationship with current Under 21s boss Gareth Southgate and is looking forward to the first leg of their European Championship play-off against Croatia at Molineux on Friday, says he has no hesitation joining up with the national team at any level.

The young striker scored his fifth goal of the season for the Baggies from the penalty spot at Liverpool 

Berahino is currently the leading English goalscorer in the Premier League with five goals and says he owes a debt to England for allowing him to escape a bloody civil war in Burundi and become a refugee at the age of 10.

He said: 'The Under 21s is a massive thing for me. England as a country has given me a second chance in life,' he said.

'England has helped me and my family, we are living well now and we are in good health, living comfortably. So getting called up to play is a big honour for me.' While Berahino harbours hopes of joining up with Hodgson's senior squad at some stage this season, he doesn't look down on the under-age national teams.

'I still remember the first game I played for the Under 16s in the Victory Shield. It was just amazing and I couldn't believe I was there. A few years before that, I wasn't even thinking about playing in a professional team let alone getting called up by England.

The West Brom youngster claims he would never turn down an international call after it emerged Jonjo Shelvey was 'reticent to join up with the Under 21s

But it hasn't done Shelvey much harm as he earned a recall to the England senior squad 

The winners of the tie against Croatia will qualify for the Euros in the Czech Republic this summer.

'We have to win the game at Wolves on Friday and make sure we go to the European finals,' he said.

'I just hope I don't get any stick from Wolves fans as an Albion player! I hope the fans are behind us and give us the best support. We will need it against a good Croatia team.' 

Having come through a troubled time at Albion last season in which he was photographed inhaling laughing gas and was struck by a team-mate, Berahino says the influence of Southgate, as well as club manager Alan Irvine, has been vital to turn his career around.

He said: 'Gareth Southgate has been brilliant. He is a great guy and easy to work with. You understand him and as soon you see him, you know what he wants. He stayed in touch with me last season and gave me some advice about when he was a youngster, what happened and how he handled certain stuff.

'It was great to see someone from the national team caring and give me a call. When I had problems, he kept in touch with me and when I did go and play for England, he always had time to sit down and have a chat. He understood and knew what was going on.

'He knew it was tough and what was happening. He was a big help.'
