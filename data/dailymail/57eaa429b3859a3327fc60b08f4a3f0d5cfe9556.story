David Letterman's Late Show cue-card holder of more than two decades was fired last week after picking a physical fight with one of the show's writers on set at the Ed Sullivan theater.

Cue-card holder Tony Mendez, 69, told the New York Post that the altercation with 57-year-old writer Bill Scheft was a long time coming, since Mr Scheft was constantly 'encroaching' and 'undermining' his work. 

However, Mr Mendez admits grabbing Mr Scheft by the collar was wrong,  and he holds nothing against Letterman for his dismissal after 21 years working for the late night king.

Drama on the Late Show set: David Letterman's long-time cue-card holder was fired last week after getting into a fight with a Late Show writer

Showdown: Cue-card holder Tony Mendez (left) said the fight with Bill Scheft (right) was a long time coming since Mr Scheft was constantly 'encroaching' on his work. Mr Mendez says he snapped on October 9 and grabbed the writer by the collar, after getting into an argument the day before during rehearsals 

Mr Mendez  says the fight on October 9 stemmed from an argument he had with the writer while rehearsing backstage with Letterman the day before.

Mr Scheft allegedly interrupted the cue-card holder in the middle of work when Mr Mendez spit back: 'I know what I'm doing. Get off my back.' 

Letterman then jumped to his writer's defense, saying: 'Tony, your sour disposition isn't helping.' 

"'You’re the one who has the sour disposition, m***********,"' Mr Mendez snapped.

While Mr Mendez says he and Letterman often use profanity when speaking to each other, he admits he was hurt that Letterman didn't take his side in the argument. 

'That night I wanted to tell Dave how much that hurt my feelings,' Mr Mendez said. 'And then I realized that this is what Bill was doing. He was trying to create a wedge between us so Dave would think I was an a******.'

Mr Mendez says he dwelled on that moment all night, and snapped the next morning when he saw Mr Scheft on set.  

'I just grabbed him by the shirt,' Mr Mendez said. 'He was very surprised. He didn’t say a word. He was cowering, his eyes were real big, he probably peed a little bit on his pants.'

'I’m the first one to say I should have never put my hands on him, but I never hit him. I just grabbed him and got my face in his face,' he added.

The cue-card holder was immediately kicked out of the theater, and four days later he received a call from the show's executive producer, informing him that he had been 'officially terminated'.

However, Mr Mendez was offered his salary and health insurance through Letterman's final months on the show. He is expected to retire in May, and will be replaced by comedian Stephen Colbert, current host of Comedy Central's Colbert Report. 

While Mr Mendez is sad to be leaving the Late Show, he says he has no ill feelings towards Letterman and doesn't believe the host was involved in his firing.  

'Dave has never let me down,' he said. 'He is the best, the most generous boss I have ever had. Dave would never do anything to harm me.' 

A spokesman for Letterman's production company Worldwide Pants declined MailOnline's request for comment.
