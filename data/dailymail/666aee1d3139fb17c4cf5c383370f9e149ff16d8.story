I am determined not to do my usual Christmas party trick of putting on nearly a stone during December. 

That doesn't mean living like a monk for the next four weeks but I am going to counter the effects of excessive booze and food calories by upping my work-outs with some High Intensity Training (HIT) home and gym sessions.

Clearly your appearance for home sessions is not a worry and you can go sans make-up for that, but at the gym a lot of women would think that’s not acceptable. And I'm one of them.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

This December Binky is determined not to pile on the pounds so has been keeping her fitness levels up along with co-star Spencer Matthews 

I know there will be some gym purists out there who will say it’s ridiculous to wear make-up for a work-out session – but with the possible exception of an all-female aerobics class or a sweat inducing bikram yoga session I would definitely opt for a subtle non-make-up, make up look.

For an hour’s open-plan gym session I would opt for some foundation cover, light eye make-up and a nude lip as you can see in the video below for MIC:FIT – Made In Chelsea’s fitness video which has been released this week.

Binky knows that some may sneer but she says she can't go to the gym without a little bit of make-up

The hour-long video has me doing torturous work-out sessions with me, Spencer Matthews, Oliver Proudlock and Lucy Watson. 

My prep for the work-outs is five minutes of stretches, 15 minutes of light base make-up prep (more of that later), and to take one or two Forza Raspberry K2 supplements for an energy boost in the mornings and help with fat burning.

As you can see in the footage I had opted for a light oil free foundation – Shiseido Pureness Mattifying Compact Oil-Free – this will breathe better with my skin when getting hot, and sweat won’t form underneath so it’s less likely to smear and won’t create break-outs or spots.

If you are going for particularly heavy cardio work then you may prefer to wear a tinted moisturiser or BB cream like Bioderma Sensibio AR BB Cream instead of foundation – but because my work-out session was under harsh studio lights (and I was being filmed!) I opted for foundation.

For a workout session Binky usually opts for a light coverage of foundation, subtle eye make-up and a nude lip

Also don’t forget that during summer months it’s good to wear a tinted sunblock for that run in the park to protect from the sun damage – I particularly like the Eucerin Tinted Sun Face Creme.

Clearly it’s best to go little and light on the whole look for the gym – you will look a tad ridiculous if you’ve put the full Saturday night war-paint on, but a bit of powder blush like Dior Rosy Glow Healthy Glow Awakening Blush to give your cheeks some colour is acceptable – (don’t overdo it though as you are likely to get red cheeks from working out anyway).

In the MIC:FIT video I am also wearing Givenchy Noir Couture Waterproof 4 in 1 Mascara, and yes I admit it I’ve got fake lashes on. Clearly it’s not worth putting lashes on for the gym, but I had just had mine done professionally and there was no way I was taking them off.

In one of the other videos I had applied quite a heavy bit of contouring – but this was just for the cameras, as it'd be way too much for a regular gym work-out.

I know there will be a hardcore clan of gym-bunnies out there who will think my gym make-up tips are bonkers, but most women are likely to concede that they would use a concealer to cover up the odd pimple or blemish – and Eucerin DermoPURIFYER Cover Stick – is perfect for that, containing salicylic acid which will attack the bacteria that forms spots as well.

Finally, whether you wear make-up in the gym or not, it is essential that you cleanse your skin thoroughly afterwards, as well as moisturise. Leaving sweat in your pores, especially under make-up, will cause break-outs. 

So if you do apply make-up for a gym session, using a multi-tasking cleanser like REN Rosa Centifolia Foaming Cleanser afterwards, which cleanses, tones and purifies the skin in one step. Follow up with a redness-reducing moisturiser such as La Roche-Posay Rosaliac UV Legere Fortifying Anti-Redness Moisturiser.

You can get all the products I've mentioned from Escentual.com, but here are a few budget alternatives if you are watching the pennies at this rather expensive time of year.
