With her brown and white spikes, beady black eyes and small nose, Sabrina the hedgehog is certainly an unusual-looking pet. But her owner, 35-year-old Kirsten Zverina, is besotted. 

‘She has a wonderful personality,’ enthuses the project manager from London. ‘She recognises me and smiles when she’s happy. She’s a lovely creature.’

Kirsten, who bought Sabrina for £150 from a breeder in Dorset two years ago, isn’t the only one to fall for the charms of a ‘hedgie’. It’s thought there are now more than 10,000 being kept as pets in the UK.

Fans delight in posting photographs of their pets dressed in comical outfits online. Some have even become celebrities.

Biddy, a three-year-old hedgehog from Oregon in the U.S., has more than 400,000 followers on Instagram.

Another, Norman, has become an internet sensation after his owner posted photographs of the hedgehog skateboarding and taking a bath. He can be recognised by his single white tooth, which protrudes comically from his mouth.

So how did the hedgehog become such a popular pet? There’s no doubt they are sweet looking. They rarely grow longer than 11 ins and weigh around 1 lb.

The type most people buy as pets — the African Pygmy — is a cross between the White-bellied hedgehog, native to central and eastern Africa, and the Algerian hedgehog. Some are pale, like the snowy Dark Eyed White hedgehog; others, like the Cinnamon Pinto, are cappuccino-coloured. The Chocolate Snowflake Pinto is dark brown.

Despite 
having up to 6,000 quills each — which protrude when they curl into a 
ball — they are surprisingly docile and easy to handle. ‘If they like 
you, the spines lie flat and they can be picked up and patted,’ says 
Kirsten. ‘They enjoy being cuddled — Sabrina often falls asleep on my 
lap in the evenings. When they’re happy, they make little squeaks, which
 sound like purring.’

Unlike some cats and dogs, they do not trigger allergies, nor do they give off the strong odour of hamsters or rats.

Fans of pygmies often post comical pictures of the pets online, with some becoming internet sensations

They are nocturnal, which means that they don’t get lonely if their owners work in the daytime.

This isn’t the first time pet hedgehogs have been popular. Children’s author Beatrix Potter had one named Mrs Tiggy-Winkle which inspired her famous story of the same name in 1905. Victorian families often kept hedgehogs in kitchens as a form of pest control, as they eat insects.

Today, European Hedgehogs — the type found in the wild in the UK — are protected and it is illegal to have them as pets.

African 
Pygmies, however, have been kept as pets since they were first brought 
into the UK just over a decade ago, after becoming fashionable in the 
U.S. in the late Eighties. It is only recently that they have become 
hugely popular.

Last
 week, it was reported that the African Pygmy Hedgehog Registry had seen
 a 5 per cent rise in membership in the past six months.

However, keeping a hedgehog is not something to be taken lightly. While they may suit those working long hours who cannot meet the demands of a dog that needs walking, they are far from low maintenance.

They must be kept in a warm environment — above 21 degrees celsius. Metal cages aren’t recommended, as hedgehogs are accomplished climbers and tend to clamber up the metal bars. Give them the run of a room, however, and they may get into difficulties. In 2011, firemen in the West Midlands were called to rescue a hedgehog that had become stuck after climbing onto a high bathroom shelf.

The African Pygmy Hedgehog Club, which promotes responsible ownership of hedgehogs in the UK, recommends keeping them in a large vivarium or glass tank.

Hedgies are
 also vulnerable to health problems. They can suffer from Wobbly 
Hedgehog Syndrome, which may sound amusing, but actually has a 
devastating effect.

This
 incurable neurological disease causes the animal to become gradually 
paralysed. It is thought that damage to the immune system through 
over-breeding could be to blame, since the disease has not affected wild
 hedgehogs.It can be fatal. Before she adopted Sabrina, Kirsten owned 
another hedgie, named Charlotte, who developed Wobbly Hedgehog Syndrome 
and died aged two.

Their normal lifespan is between three and eight years. ‘It was terrible,’ says Kirsten. ‘She was like a family member and there was nothing we could do.’

Hedgies have sensitive stomachs and are prone to obesity, which can cause complications, such as fatty liver disease and heart attacks. 

Helen Dickerson, a 36-year-old volunteer at Animals In Need in Northamptonshire, adopted her pet hedgehog Samson from the National Exotic Hedgehog Rescue Service in November 2012. He had been abandoned by a family who claimed their children ‘didn’t want him any more’ and weighed nearly 2lb — far too much for his 6 in-long frame.

‘I had to put him on a low-fat diet and he was clearly unhappy — he’d roll into a ball and hiss and push his spikes out. It took quite a bit of cuddling and attention before he came round and relaxed,’ she says.

Owners are 
advised to feed their hedgehogs a mix of low-fat cat foods — mixing 
varieties ensures that should one brand be discontinued, the hedgehog’s 
stomach won’t be too upset by a sudden change. For a treat, they enjoy 
live insects as well as certain cooked foods, such as chicken and boiled
 eggs. Kirsten says Sabrina is fond of mint, while Charlotte would lap 
up anything sprinkled with coriander. 

One
 way to stop hedgehogs putting on too much weight is to set up a hamster
 wheel. They are energetic when given the chance, and can run the 
equivalent of more than three miles a night.

There is, of course, a danger that if hedgies become too popular, then unscrupulous breeders will attempt to cash in on the trend.

Dedicated societies such as the African Pygmy Hedgehog Registry and the African Pygmy Hedgehog Club keep lists of approved breeders, but on websites such as Gumtree, hedgehogs are advertised for sale anonymously for up to £200. But many ‘backyard’ breeders don’t understand — or don’t care — that hedgehogs have delicate reproductive systems.

Mate a hedgehog younger than six months and it may be unable to care for its young. But if a mother hedgehog is more than a year old when she has her first litter, her  pelvis may have fused, requiring  a Caesarean. Emma Crossan, a 24-year-old breeder from Lancashire, and head of the African Pygmy Hedgehog Club, says: ‘There should be a licensing system in place.’

Hedgehog conservationists warn fraudsters may attempt to catch wild European Hedgehogs to pass off as pets. Hugh Warwick, hedgehog conservationist and author of A Prickly Affair: The Charm Of The Hedgehog, fears such fraud is inevitable.

Last week, it was reported that the African Pygmy Hedgehog Registry had seen a five per cent rise in membership in the past six months

He says this would be disastrous for our indigenous hedgehog population, which is already struggling — population figures have plummeted by 37 per cent in the past decade — and leave unsuspecting customers with animals they can’t handle.

‘Wild hedgehogs are very different creatures and are totally inappropriate as pets,’ he says.  Following the similar recent trend for ‘micropigs’, several owners found that rather than buying specially bred miniature pigs, they had been sold baby farm animals.

Earlier this year, 46-year-old Donna Davidson was threatened with eviction from her rented home in Leicester after she bought what she believed to be a micropig — only for it to grow into a 21st hog.

Animal charities are warning that the sudden popularity of the pygmy hedgehog could lead to people buying them on impulse, then abandoning them. Since the start of 2013, the National Exotic Hedgehog Rescue Service has taken in 89 discarded pygmies.

‘We’re seeing an increase of hogs coming in for various reasons, such as job losses and change of circumstances,’ says Rachel Cookson, who works for the Rescue Service.

For devoted hedgie fans such as Emma, Kirsten and Helen, that prospect is heart-breaking. Helen says: ‘People just think, “Oh, aren’t they cute”, and get them on a whim but, in fact, they need a lot of care.’

Nevertheless, she says that, for those prepared to look after their hedgies properly, African Pygmies are a joy: ‘They are amazing creatures. Samson is quirky, funny and unique. He makes me smile every day. He’s gone from being a ball of spikes to part of the family.’
