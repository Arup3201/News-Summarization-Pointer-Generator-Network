Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius's chances of winning bail appeared to increase dramatically today after an embarrassing series of blunders and confusion in the prosecution case.

Just hours after the police officer leading the murder hunt told the athlete's bail hearing in Pretoria that the performance enhancing drug testosterone and steroids had been found at his mansion home shortly after the killing of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, prosecutors changed their story.

In a humiliating U-turn, a spokesman for South Africa's National Prosecution Agency said there had been an error in the evidence of detective Warrant Officer Hilton Botha when he identified the substance found in the 26 year-old's bedroom.

Boxes of 'testosterone' and needles were found at Oscar Pistorius' home where he shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead after 'non-stop' arguing, a court heard today

Investigating officer Hilton Botha had to correct himself in court after initially saying steroids were found at the home of Oscar Pistorius. He then said it was testosterone but prosecution later admitted the drugs have not yet been tested

Medupe Simasiku said it is too early 
to identify the substance as it is still undergoing laboratory tests.

In fact, no results of any forensic tests from the scene of the killing 
had been given to investigators.

There had been gasps in court when WO 
Botha, a policeman for 24 years and the first officer to arrive at the 
Pistorius house on Valentine's Day following the shooting of the 29 
year-old model and law graduate, and prosecutors claimed testosterone 
had been found together with needles.

Discovery of the sports drug could 
potentially have brought questions over the star's achievements at 
London 2012 where he became the first athlete to compete at an Olympics 
and Paralympics, winning two gold medals and a silver.

At one stage, the detective supposedly
 providing the key facts to keep Pistorius in custody had agreed with 
the defence lawyer that police had no evidence challenging the runner's 
claim he accidently killed his girlfriend in a bathroom, believing it 
was an intruder.

Police accuse Africa's most famous sportsman of premeditated murder, a charge he emphatically denies.

Damning: The first half of the hearing saw damning allegations surface, but after a recess his defence team fired tough questions at the main witness, chief investigative officer Hilton Botha

WO Botha left prosecutors rubbing 
their temples, only able to look down at their notes as he misjudged 
distances and acknowledged a bungling forensics team left in the 
bathroom toilet bowl one of the bullets fired at Miss Steenkamp.

The second day of the bail hearing in a
 case that has riveted South Africa and much of the world appeared at 
first to go against the double-amputee runner, with prosecutors saying a
 witness can testify to hearing 'non-stop talking, like shouting' 
between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. before the predawn shooting on February 14.

However, WO Botha later said under cross examination that the person who
 overheard the argument was in a house 600 metres away in Pistorius's 
gated community in the suburbs of South Africa's capital, Pretoria.

Later, prosecutor Gerrie Nel 
questioned the detective and acknowledged the distance was much closer.

But confusion reigned for much of his testimony when at one point WO 
Botha said officers found syringes and steroids in Pistorius' bedroom.

Mr Nel quickly cut the officer off and said the drugs were actually testosterone.

Defence lawyer, Barry Roux, asserted 
when questioning the detective that it was not a banned substance and 
that police were trying to give the discovery a 'negative connotation.'

'It is an herbal remedy,' Mr Roux said. 'It is not a steroid and it is 
not a banned substance.'

WO Botha had claimed examination of the model's
 body and the bathroom door Pistorius fired through suggested he had 
been had been wearing his prosthetic legs - directly contradicting the 
athlete's claims that he was on his stumps and fired believing an 
intruder had broken in.

'I believe that he knew that Reeva was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door,' the detective told the court.

Pistorius broke down in tears during the second day of the bail hearing as Mr Botha outlined the forensic evidence

Detective Hilton Botha said he believed the bullets were fired down suggesting Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were discharged

As details were released from Miss 
Steenkamp's post mortem showing bullets hit the right side of her head, 
her hip and right elbow - resulting in a broken arm, Pistorius lent 
forward sobbing and muttered prayers, the muscles straining on his neck.

In apparently damning evidence aimed 
at countering the athlete's case for bail, WO Botha said he viewed the 
man who won two gold medals and a silver at London 2012 as a 'flight 
risk' pointing out he had not used any of the four telephones found at 
the house to call police and claiming his family had been searching for a
 memory stick containing details of off-shore bank accounts.

But amid confusion, Mr Roux began to 
pick holes in the prosecution case with the officer forced to 
acknowledge that the witness who allegedly overheard the argument was 
600 metres from Pistorius' house at the Silver Woods complex on the 
outskirts of Pretoria. He later changed this to 300 metres.

Police 'take every piece of evidence 
and try to extract the most possibly negative connotation and present it
 to the court,' Mr Roux told magistrate Desmond Nair.

Pistorius's brother Carl said after the hearing that he 'trusts everyone has more clarity about this tragic incident'

There was even laughter in the court 
during an exchange between Mr Nair and WO Botha with the magistrate 
asking the officer about his belief that if granted bail, Pistorius 
would flee South Africa.

Addressing WO Botha and prosecutor 
Gerrie Nel, Mr Nair said: 'The accused before court is an international
 athlete, paralympic athlete, he uses prosthesis on both legs.

'I'm sure 
we would both agree that his face is widely recognised internationally. 
Do you subjectively believe that he would take the opportunity, being 
who he is, using prosthesics to get around, to flee South Africa?'

WO 
Botha responded: 'Yes.' Security in the court stopped the laughter in 
the court.

The magistrate raises his eyebrows.

WO Botha protested: 'I believe for 
someone facing 15 years to life, I would make a plan to get out and go 
somewhere, with the finances he has.'

Bathroom plan: A projector was used to beam the plans up for the public and press to see

Mr Nair said: 'And if he were to 
flee, he may opt for a country with no extradition agreement with South 
Africa?' 'It's possible,' the officer replied.

Mr Nair pressed him: 'But do you think
 it's possible that a person who has won Olympic golds would want to 
forsake his career when he has a chance to prove his innocence in a 
court of law?'

'Your honour, imprisonment is no joke,' the officer said.

The exchanges appeared to lift the 
spirits and hopes of the Pistorius family sitting in court that the bail
 application might be successful, their dark mood during the initial 
stages of prosecution evidence changing to one of relief and smiles as 
they left court.

Earlier, Mr Nel said the killing was premeditated because Pistorius took time to put on his prosthetic legs before the shooting.

He projected a plan of the bedroom and
 bathroom for the courtroom and argued Pistorius had to walk past his 
bed to get to the bathroom and could not have done so without realizing 
the Miss Steenkamp was not in the bed as he claimed.

'There's no other way of getting there,' Mr Nel said.

WO Botha said the holster for the 9mm
 pistol was found under the side of the bed on which Steenkamp slept - 
also implying it would have been impossible for Pistorius to get the gun
 without realizing that Miss Steenkamp was not in the bed and could have
 been the person in the bathroom WO Botha said he wanted Pistorius 
charged additionally with a weapons violation after unlicensed .38 
calibre ammunition was found at the house.

Mr Roux asked the officer if Miss 
Steenkamp's body - she was wearing white shorts and a black vest - 
showed 'any pattern of defensive wounds,' and the detective said it did 
not.

WO Botha said the shots were fired 
from five feet, and that police found three spent cartridges in the 
bathroom and one in the hallway connecting the bathroom to the bedroom. 
He admitted police had initially missed finding one cartridge.

The hearing at Pretoria Magistrates' Court is due to resume at 11am local time tomorrow morning - it was initially expected to last for two days

Police also found two iPhones in the 
bathroom and two BlackBerrys in the bedroom, he said, adding that none 
had been used to phone for help. Pistorius had said that he called the 
manager of his guarded and gated housing complex and a private paramedic
 service.

Mr Roux countered Pistorius did make 
calls, including to the guards of the housing estate. In one case, he 
said, a guard could hear Pistorius crying.

'Was it part of his premeditated plan, not to switch off the phone and cry?' Mr Roux asked sarcastically.

Screaming heard coming from the house was Pistorius calling for help from his balcony, not Miss Steenkamp, the lawyer said.

Leaving court , the athlete's brother 
Carl Pistorius said : 'I feel like the court proceedings went well. We 
trust that everyone has more clarity about this tragic incident.'
