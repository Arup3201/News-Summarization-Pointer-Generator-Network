Scotland’s struggling oil industry will be bailed out by the UK Government, George Osborne revealed today.

The Chancellor said he had already cut taxes on North Sea oil to protect jobs in the industry, amid rapidly falling prices, but would take ‘further steps at the Budget’ in March to help.

But Mr Osborne also revealed that MPs representing Scottish constituencies could be barred from voting on parts of the Budget after the election – once the Edinburgh government had been handed sweeping new powers over tax and spending.

The Chancellor, appearing before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, said the Government’s support for the North Sea oil industry was only possible because Scotland had rejected independence in last year’s referendum.

He said the problems suffered by the industry ‘reminds everyone of the risk of independence’.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has revealed that an independent Scotland could have been up to £7billion worse off as a result of falling oil revenue.

Mr Osborne lambasted predictions made by the SNP during the referendum campaign about the finances North Sea oil would generate for the nation as ‘wildly optimistic’.

He told the Commons Treasury select committee: ‘I took decisions in the Autumn Statement to reduce taxes on North Sea oil, anticipating the pressures that the falling oil price would have on the industry and I'm sure we are going to have to take further steps at the Budget.

‘But we can only do that because we are United Kingdom and we pool our risks.’

The energy industry is suffering a wave of job losses as oil prices continue to plummet amid increasing US production and falling demand in economically struggling countries.

Mr Osborne said that while UK economic forecasts were made by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, Scotland's predictions were made by its government.

He added: ‘From memory, the Scottish government forecast that they would receive £20 billion of revenues in the coming three years from oil if oil taxes were devolved.

‘I think it is going to be probably around one third of that, well, that was the most recent forecast published and, of course, the oil price has fallen further since.

Mr Osborne said the problems suffered by the industry ‘reminds everyone of the risk of independence’ promoted by SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (above)

‘So, they don't have a particularly great track record and, of course, if Scotland had become independent, if the people of Scotland had voted for independence, the promises that the SNP had made to the people of Scotland, they would not have been able to deliver on because they have got their wildly optimistic, and that's a polite way of putting it, forecasts about oil tax.

‘So, one of the great benefits of the United Kingdom is that we can help each other when things like the oil prices change dramatically.’

The Chancellor also confirmed that draft legislation on the devolution of extra powers to Holyrood will be published on Thursday.

But he said because Edinburgh was getting sweeping new spending powers, restrictions on the voting powers of Scottish MPs would ‘have to apply on areas connected with the Budget’.

In a message aimed at Ed Balls, who could find himself in No 11 Downing Street after the election as part of a Labour government relying on the support of smaller parties such as the SNP, Mr Osborne also said the chancellor after the next election should not be ‘beholden on Scottish nationalist votes’.

Once powers to set income tax have been devolved, Scotland would have to ‘live with the consequences’ of its decisions - including if wealthy individuals flee across the border to escape ‘punitive’ rates, Mr Osborne told the Treasury Select Committee.

Mr Osborne said proposals for ‘English votes for English laws’ would be published before the general election, but he insisted that it must be the case that Scottish MPs should have their ability to vote on aspects of future Budgets curbed if powers have been devolved.

The cross-party Smith Commission on devolution said the Scottish MPs should continue to vote on the UK's Budget, including income tax.

Many aspects of the system would remain UK-wide, Mr Osborne said, including the definition of income and the system of reliefs, so MPs from Scottish constituencies would be able to vote on those.
