Kate, 32, who is around 11 weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, is said to have pulled out of a trip to Portsmouth, Hampshire

The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly pulled out of another official engagement because she is still suffering from severe morning sickness.

Kate, 32, who is around 11 weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, is said to have pulled out of a trip to Portsmouth, Hampshire, on Monday.

She had been planning to visit Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie's America's Cup team at its new £12million headquarters at Camber Docks in Old Portsmouth.

However, it was reported today that she has been forced to cancel the official visit next week because she continues to suffer from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition which saw her hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby, Prince George, now one.

The Express reported that a royal source had confirmed Kate's trip to Portsmouth had been cancelled and said she had no plans to undertake any other official engagements before next week.

Kensington Palace said: 'Her engagements are being reviewed on a case by case basis. Any future engagements will be announced in due course.'

It is the latest in a string of official engagements to be cancelled by the Duchess as she continues to battle the vomiting condition.

Last week, she had to cancel an appearance at a new project in London, organised by The Art Room - one of the charities of which is she patron.

At the time, Kensington Palace said the Duchess was 'hugely disappointed' at having to pull out.

The Duchess did, however, send a personally-penned message to be read out to the disappointed children. 

In it she apologised for not being there, saying she was 'truly sorry' at having to cancel, but promised to see the venue for herself soon. 

Her cancelled engagements have set tongues wagging that she may be pregnant with twins, with one leading doctor explaining that a multiple pregnancy can make morning sickness worse. 

Speaking to the MailOnline, Consultant Gynaecologist Dr Andrew Paterson said: 'HCG is a pregnancy hormone secreted by the placenta and in twins, far more of this hormone is released. 

'As HCG is associated with nausea women carrying twins can experience worse morning sickness. 

'In fact one of the first things we do if a woman comes to me experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum is scan them, not only to check the baby but also to check for twins.

'It is obviously not a hard and fast rule and pregnancy differs with every woman.' 

Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, added: 'In twins expectant mothers experience twice the hormones, and so often twice the sickness.' 

As a result of Kate's severe morning sickness, Kensington Palace has been unusually circumspect about announcing engagements.

The Duchess has not been seen in public since news of her pregnancy was released by Kensington Palace last month. 

Her last official engagement was on August 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the Tower of London with her husband William and Prince Harry. 

Her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12-week stage but there is speculation that the royal couple's second child could be due in April.

Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies.

The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. 

It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.

It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers.

The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.

They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.

It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.

Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat.

Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.

Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition.

An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice. 

The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage.
