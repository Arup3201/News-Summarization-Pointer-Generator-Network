A 16-year-old boy whose life was miraculously saved by a heart transplant from an anonymous donor was also touched to receive an emotional note from the donor’s family advising him to ‘live life to the max.’

Brett Wallick of Peoria, Arizona, was a typical healthy and active teenager until he started suffering chest pains last December.

Thinking their son had asthma, his parents Scott, a retired Senior Master Sgt in the Airforce, and step mom Carla scheduled a doctor’s appointment.

Brett Wallick, who was miraculously saved by a heart transplant from an anonymous donor, was also touched to receive an emotional note from the donor's family advising him to 'live life to the max'

The family’s world was upside down when the doctor told them that a virus was attacking the sophomore student’s heart and that the only way he could survive is if he received a transplant.

Brett was diagnosed with a dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition that causes the heart to become so weakened and enlarged that it cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body. 

Ten days later after the diagnosis, Brett had a mechanical pump fitted at Phoenix Children's Hospital that would help his heart pump blood through his body.

The device was necessary to would keep him alive until a donor heart became available, reports AZCentral.

Happy family: Brett Wallick, his father Scott, step mom Carla and step sister Jordan

He was a son, a brother and a father.He was always a giving person. Always cared for others.We as a family wish you the best. Live life to the max. Keep him in your prayers.We as a family would like to know about you, one day, when you get better.Know that our family member always wanted to help others.

Brett was been placed on the heart transplant list in the hope that a donor could be found. As well as the right blood type, the heart also had to be the correct size.

For the next three months Brett and his family waited patiently to hear about a transplant. When they finally received word, doctors had to act fast and the operation took place just hours later.

In the hours following the successful operation, Brett’s father wrote a letter to the donor's family to thank them for giving his son hope.

Scott passed his note on to April Colón, the pediatric cardiac transplant coordinator, to forward to the Donor Network of Arizona to eventually be handed over to the donor's family.

As Colón was in the process of forwarding the letter, she discovered a photocopy of a handwritten letter in a binder of information that had come with Brett's new heart.

It was something that she had never seen before.

Road to recovery: After the operation, doctors had expected Brett to stay in the hospital for another two weeks, but he was home in nine days

The note started: ‘He was a son, a brother and a father. He was always a giving person. Always cared for others.’

 Wallick, who was in the Air Force for 26 years, and his wife Carla were
 in tears as the emotion of what they and their son had been through.

The note continued: 'We as a family wish you the best. Live life to the max. Keep him in your prayers.We as a family would like to know about you, one day, when you get better.

'Know that our family member always wanted to help others.'

Scott Wallick felt the note could have been describing his own son. 

Brett hopes to get the chance one day to meet his donor's family and plans to let them listen to his heart with a stethoscope

'It will be nice for them to know that a part of him is living on in you,' he told AZCentral.

Wife Carla said the note made her think about the donor's mother. 'Her son's heart is keeping my son alive,' she said.

The fact the note was a photocopy makes Colón believe that the donor gave more than just his heart after his death.

After the operation, doctors had expected Brett to stay in the hospital for another two weeks, but he was home in nine days.

Brett now plans to put the letter in a frame on his bedroom wall.

He hopes to get the chance to meet his donor's family and has said he will let them listen to his heart with a stethoscope. 'It feels just like mine,' he said.
