A woman killed herself the day after her beloved horse died.

Stephanie Lees, 42, had devoted ten years to caring for Jake, who she rode in the fields and lanes around her rural village.

When he became lame, she was heartbroken – and hours after he was put down, she committed suicide. Her family said she could not bear to be without him.

A neighbour said that she had died near where her horse was put to sleep, adding: ‘She was found with part of Jake’s mane in her hand.’

Her body was discovered by friends who she had planned to ride with that day, the neighbour said.

Miss Lees, who was single and had no children, became even more attached to Jake after her other horse, Elliot, died three years ago. She had been unable to ride Jake for more than a year due to his ill health, and had struggled to cope as she watched the animal deteriorate.

A week before the tragedy, Jake had an operation which was at first deemed a success. But he grew worse and it became clear that he would not survive.

Josephine Lees said her daughter killed herself in response to his death, saying: ‘Steph couldn’t bear to be parted from Jake and made a decision to join him.’

Mrs Lees, 74, added: ‘It was really the loss of Jake which broke her heart. He had gone lame about 18 months ago and had to be put down the day before. She hadn’t been able to ride him and devoted most of her spare time to looking after him. She absolutely adored him.’

Mrs Lees and her husband John were told of their daughter’s death by police on Remembrance Sunday this month.

She said: ‘We are devastated and heartbroken.’

Mr Lees, 79, said: ‘She just wanted to join him, which is in some ways a happy thing, but also very sad.

‘She was very much loved. We’ve had about 200 cards from people.’

Miss Lees kept 20-year-old Jake in a field near her home in Cawthorne, South Yorkshire. She worked as a surveyor for Barnsley Council – but spent much of her time with horses, training in dressage and riding with the Rockwood Harriers hunt.

At her funeral on Tuesday, friends followed her coffin on horseback. They recalled a ‘wonderful, caring and patient’ woman. One wrote online: ‘Steph was a sunbeam. The prettiest smile in the village and a fine horsewoman. Unbearably sad to think she’s gone from us.’

An inquest to determine the exact cause of death is yet to be opened, pending toxicology test results.
