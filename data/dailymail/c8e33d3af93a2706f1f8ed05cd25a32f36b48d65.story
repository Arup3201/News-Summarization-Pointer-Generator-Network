Travel used to be far more romantic than plugging a post code into your sat nav. 

A series of rare vintage posters harking back to the halcyon days of travel around Britain in the 1960s have emerged for sale to remind us of a simpler time. 

Shell guides were first launched in the 1930s and illustrated by famous artists. The images gained cult following and were so popular they were printed as posters and used in schools. 

Each poster comes with a illustration of the area as well as a short blurb about its history, geography and cultural significance and they set to go up for auction valued at up to £200 each.

The posters heralded a time when Britons were taking to the roads in their thousands as motoring became cheaper and more widespread. 

Sponsored by the Shell oil company, they advertise popular destinations across the country including Kent, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Cornwall and Oxfordshire.

They also feature further flung counties like Midlothian in Scotland and Cardiganshire in Wales.

The collection of 11 posters is being sold by Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset in an auction that will be held tomorrow.

The final series of Shell guides was printed in 1987.
