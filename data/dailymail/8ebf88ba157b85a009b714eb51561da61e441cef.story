Clive Palmer has lobbied for it and now his party will officially campaign on it - with Palmer United Party Queensland leader, Carl Judge, confirming they will push for North Queensland to be recognised as an independent state at the upcoming state election.

Mr Judge said the independence of North Queensland from the southern region is now a key platform of the Palmer United Party going into the next Queensland state election.

'North Queensland has the industry and economic viability to be recognised as Australia’s official seventh state,' Mr Judge said.

'It should be able to govern itself through its own representation.'

Outspoken Independent MP Bob Katter is another politician who has long held the same belief that North Queensland be afforded state-hood.

Mr Judge claimed there would be significant advantages to North Queensland’s self-government.

'The region has long been neglected by both the state and federal governments, yet it continues to act as a major economic centre and contributor to the Australian economy.'

Clive Palmer, the PUP founder, championed the cause of North Queensland to be afforded independence from the rest of the state in the lead-up to the last federal election

Mr Judge said the residents of North Queensland have told him they want a greater say in the region’s affairs and have sought that for quite some time.

'Independence would provide them with that opportunity,' he added.

'Boundaries and the state capital are all decisions North Queenslanders would have to decide upon should the Palmer United Party be successful at the next state election,' Mr Judge said.

Depending on where the boundaries would be placed, the population base of a North Queensland state would be at the very least 350,000 but could be more than 500,000.
