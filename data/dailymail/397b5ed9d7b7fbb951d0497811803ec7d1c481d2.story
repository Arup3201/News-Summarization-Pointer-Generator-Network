Gutted by fire and currently uninhabitable, even an estate agent could not hide the problems with this property.

However, that did not stop one woman bidding $790,000 for the smoke-strained ruin in St Peter's, Sydney, despite her husband's attempts to stop her.

Footage shot at the auction shows an increasingly desperate George Ge tugging at Sonia Chen's arm in a futile bid to keep her out of the bidding war.

A determined wife has completely gone against the wishes of her concerned husband after bidding nearly $1 million at auction for an unliveable house

He eventually had to admit defeat and a delighted Mrs Chen secured the cottage for $90,000 above the reserve. 

Over 20 potential buyers registered to bid on the property and the bids came thick and fast for the sought-after house. 

Bidding on the three-bedroom house began at $550,000 but rose after a quick-fire round of bids. 

The house ended up selling for $790,000, which is significantly higher than the Sydney median house price of $725,000. 

Nothing could deter Sonia Chen from forking out $970,000 for the property

Sonia's husband George was at a loss as to how to control his wife at the auction

Sonia can be seen looking triumphant at the end of the video, as her wary husband cowers behind his hands, clearly dreading the renovation process to come.

In an interview following the sale, a dumbfounded Mr Ge revealed to Channel 9 that he was at a loss as to how the couple would face the imminent renovations.

'She is excited, not me,' he said, referring to his ecstatic wife, who could not hide her broad smile.

The auctioneer appeared to be delighted that the house went for $90,000 over the reserve price

When reporters questioned  Mr Ge on why wasn't more enthusiastic about his investment, he replied: 'Because I have to do, a lot of work for this one... I don't know how to do that,'

Mr Ge revealed that the purchase was an impulse buy on his wife's part and he was at a loss to what would happen next. 

'Not very planned, not very prepared, but she is determined' he said. 'I don't really know what to do next.'

The house was gutted by a raging blaze in August and left extensive smoke damage throughout the property. 

Over 20 bidders registered for the auction 

Sonia Chen was ecstatic when she was the final bidder standing 

The previous owner, Tom Noicos, was forced to sell-up after his insurance company suspected arson was involved in the demise of the home and refused to pay him any compensation for the tragedy. 

Speaking to Domain,Noicos said he was devastated when his three-bedroom home was destroyed, but can see the silver lining in the huge profit he has made.  

'I always think from all that's bad something good happens,' the former IT worker said. 

'The price was good and if I can find the right place [to move] that will be even better.'
