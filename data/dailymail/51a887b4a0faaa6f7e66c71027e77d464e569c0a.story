Outside court: Gary Lester, 53, denies sexually assaulting two women. He is accused of kissing and groping them after being booked for a massage

A masseur accused of sexually assaulting two of his female clients boasted to one of them that he was good at performing sex acts and tried to kiss her, a court has heard.

Gary Lester, 53, of Kensworth, Bedfordshire, told the woman as he massaged her that he was aroused and said she had a great body, St Albans Crown Court heard.

The 27-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly returned to her parents' home in a distressed state and went for a shower, waking her mother, who said her daughter was ‘scrubbing her body hysterically’.

The mother added: ‘There were red marks all over her - her chest, her face, her neck. I was shocked and asked what the matter was. She was rubbing her skin and couldn't speak properly.’

The mother said she covered her with a towel and gave her hug, taking a few minutes to calm her down.

She said: ‘My daughter said Gary had been very sexual toward her - verbally and physically. He was stroking her thighs whilst being very suggestive. He also talked about how she had a great body.’

She added: ‘He tried to kiss her and it was on her chin. He said he was “hot and flustered”.

Two days later she reported it to the police. The woman, of Bedfordshire, now aged 29, had first gone for an appointment with Lester in March 2011.

After that, she told her mother Lester
was ‘a bit strange’ and was unsure if she would make another 
appointment - but she went back in June 2011, when the assault is 
alleged to have taken place.

Hearing: Mr Lester, whose trial is taking place at St Albans Crown Court (pictured), has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting one woman in June 2011 and to sexually assaulting another woman in September 2010

Mr Lester has pleaded not guilty to 
sexually assaulting the woman in June 2011 and to sexually assaulting 
another woman from Hertfordshire in September 2010.

Last week the first woman - from 
Hertfordshire - said she had a 'Raynor' deep tissue massage from Lester 
at her home in Kings Langley in December 2009 after he was recommended.

She said: ‘I was stressed out. I thought a massage would be good to help me relax. I had problems with my neck.’ 

He took her blood pressure and carried out a consultation.‘It was a full body massage,' she added. 'Everywhere apart from my private area. It was OK.’

The woman said on that occasion she 
had no complaint and sent Lester a message saying: ‘Thanks for a great 
massage. I had a lovely sleep last night. I will have a massage 
regularly with you.’

But it was not until September 2010 that she booked a second massage at her new St Albans home.

The woman, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said her daughter, who is in her 20s, was in the house when the massage began.

She went on: ‘I was covered with a towel. He was massaging up my leg. I started to feel uneasy.

‘The pressure was different - it was lighter, less like a 
massage, something more sensual. He said: “You have got lovely skin”. I 
thought it was a bit odd.’

She said he told her that he was not 
having much of a sex life with his girlfriend and did not know if they 
would stay together.

‘I didn't want to know anything about his sex life, while he is massaging me and I am lying there,’ she said.

'The pressure was different - it was lighter, less like a massage, something more sensual. He said: "You have got lovely skin". I thought it was a bit odd'

On that occasion the woman said he massaged her breasts, but did so in a way that she did not think was sexual.

George Heimler, prosecuting, asked her if she wanted Lester to do anything in a sexual way. She replied: ‘No.’

He went on: ‘Were you interested in anything beyond his professional services?’ She replied: ‘No.’

The woman said she was a little 
confused, but booked a third massage at her St Albans home later that 
month. She lit candles, put out aroma therapy oil and dimmed the lights.

She said: ‘He massaged me and said he 
was going to massage at a swingers' party the following weekend. He was 
working on my legs and came up to do my bottom.

‘He was a bit longer than I expected. He said: “I'm taking too long massaging your bum. You have got a really nice bum”.’

The woman, who said she had more than 
100 massages from others in the past, told the jury of eight men and 
four women that she felt uncomfortable.

Then, she said he ran his hands up from her hip up the side of her body and said: 'Do you want a sensual massage?'

She said she did not want one, but 
allowed him to massage her breasts, which she thought was part of a 
normal massage. She said she told him she did not feel comfortable and 
he stopped.

'My daughter said Gary had been very sexual toward her - verbally and physically. He was stroking her thighs whilst being very suggestive. He also talked about how she had a great body'

At the end of the massage she said he 
kissed her on the forehead. ‘I said: “Did you just kiss me?” He didn't 
say anything and he just kissed me again in the same place,’ she said.

The Hertfordshire woman made a 
complaint to the police in June 2011 after hearing that a woman from 
Bedfordshire, who is not known to her, had made a similar allegation.

Mr Heimler said: ‘He is a professional
masseur. He took advantage of his position to test the boundaries with 
the two complainants to see if they want to provide sexual favours, to 
see if he could obtain some form of sexual gratification.

‘He kissed the first victim twice. It was unsought, undesired and unwanted.’

When Lester was questioned by the police he said all the contact was fully consensual and he behaved professionally throughout.

He said the Bedfordshire woman had 
been ‘flirting like crazy’ and was coming onto him sexually. He said the
Hertfordshire woman was the one who spoke about sex and swingers 
parties.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
