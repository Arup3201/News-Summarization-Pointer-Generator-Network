Mother-of-two Naudel Turner, 42, was pronounced dead in hospital after she was stabbed at least four times in the neck in Tottenham, north London

A nurse stabbed to death in broad daylight is thought to have been killed by one of her mental health patients.

Naudel Turner, 42, was attacked soon after she left work on Wednesday afternoon.

The churchgoing mother of two had screamed at her assailant to ‘leave me alone’ seconds before he stabbed her in the neck multiple times with a kitchen knife.

Yesterday it emerged that as Mrs Turner slumped to the ground, some bystanders filmed the scene on their mobile phones.

Witnesses described how after the frenzied attack, her assailant calmly rolled a cigarette as he stood over Mrs Turner’s body, wiped his hands on her clothing and said: ‘I told you, I told you.’

He was then seen yanking the blade out of her neck and placing it on her chest as she lay dying on the busy street in Tottenham, North London.

Police arrested the man at the scene. Mrs Turner was taken to hospital, but doctors were unable to save her.

Her husband William, 61, is said to be ‘shell-shocked’.

He appeared distraught at the couple’s terrace home in Fulham, West London, yesterday. When asked about his wife, he said only: ‘She used to live here. But not any longer.’

A close friend and neighbour, who asked not to be named, said Mrs Turner ‘doted’ on the couple’s sons, aged 22 and 19.

‘She just loved her family to pieces,’ they added.

‘They’re upstanding members of the community. It’s a massive shock. She was such a gentle woman. She’s an angel.’

The friend revealed Mrs Turner’s attacker was thought to be an ex-patient of hers.

‘I think this must have been a nutter who’s been let down by aftercare because of the cuts to the NHS,’ they said.

‘Someone
 that can stab an innocent person who has been helping them is clearly 
not all there. Who could stab a wife, a mother, a community nurse? How 
can anybody do that and roll a cigarette over her dead body?’

She said of Mrs Turner’s husband: ‘He is shell-shocked. It is just so raw. He’s not sleeping.’

Witnesses
 said Mrs Turner had just left Castle View Surgery in Tottenham when she
 was accosted by a man who started a ‘blazing row’.

One
 woman said the nurse screamed ‘leave me alone’ and ‘froze in fear’ as 
the knifeman struck. He then wiped his bloody hands on her clothes, 
saying: ‘I told you, I told you.’

Another witness added: ‘I heard the screaming so I went over to see what was happening.

‘I
 saw the woman lying on her back with neck wounds. There was blood 
everywhere. There was a man stood a few feet away from her against the 
railings. I asked him if he was okay, but he didn’t answer.

Officers were said to be looking at traces of tobacco, following claims the alleged killer rolled a cigarette after stabbing Mrs Turner at least four times

‘I
 looked at her and she was still breathing. A kitchen knife was laying 
on her chest. It wasn’t embedded, it had just been placed there.

‘I was leaning over her and she was looking down. Then she looked up at me, took a breath, and shut her eyes.

‘Two blokes came over and wrestled the guy to the ground and sat on him until the police came.’

Staff
 at Mrs Turner’s workplace refused to discuss whether her attacker was a
 former  mental health patient, but police said the possibility was 
being explored.

One colleague, Dr Fariba Azarian, said they were ‘shocked and distraught’.

‘She
 was an absolutely lovely, lovely lady,’ she said. ‘One of the most 
professional and caring people that I have seen. She was somebody who 
would go out of her way to help people and patients. She was very, very 
kind.’

Witnesses said they believe Mrs Turner knew her attacker, who did not attempt to flee the scene

A post-mortem examination will be held at Haringey Mortuary today, when an inquest will open and adjourn

Forensic officers investigate after the 42-year-old woman was stabbed in broad daylight

Scotland Yard appealed yesterday for those seen recording at the scene to come forward.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: ‘Mrs Turner was a hard-working mother
 of two boys. We now believe she knew her attacker.

‘I
 would like to directly appeal to anyone who may have captured images or
 footage before and after the incident to contact us immediately. In 
particular we would like to speak to a black male who was wearing a 
white tracksuit top who witnesses saw taking images at the scene.

‘I
 would appeal to him or anyone else to contact us with the footage or 
images they took as a matter  of urgency, and not to upload  them to the
 internet or share them with friends as it may harm our investigation.’

Dariusz Miakienko, 46, was last night charged with murder. He will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court later today.
