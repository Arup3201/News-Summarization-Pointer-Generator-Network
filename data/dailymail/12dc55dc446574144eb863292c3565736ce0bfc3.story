Former Olympic swimming champion Libby Trickett is five kilograms heavier than her competitive weight and has never been happier.

As an elite athlete, Trickett, now 29, didn’t have the opportunity to embrace her feminine qualities.

‘You’re not a woman, you’re an athlete so it’s a very strong distinction between the two because you’re not allowed to have breasts, hips or a butt - those things can’t be there,’ she told the MailOnline.

Trickett now exercises seven hours per week instead of the intense 35-hour regime she endured when she was a professional swimmer

Trickett fell into a deep depression for six months when she first retired at the end of 2009, after giving up on exercise which resulted in her gaining 10kg.

‘I tried to rebel against exercising, which you do after doing 35 hours a week of exercise for 10 years, but obviously it impacts on your mental and physical health,’ she said.

Unsure of where to turn, Trickett decided to go back to what she did best and got back into the pool.

A third gold medal later, Trickett retired again 12 months ago and is now just five kg heavier than her competitive weight, which she has maintained for the past eight months.

Those dark days are well and truly over for the Queenslander, who now exercises seven hours a week - one fifth of the regime she endured as a professional swimmer.

‘The second time, l feel like I’m doing it better but being more patient with myself – a lot kinder and doing it with a lot more love,’ she said.  ‘I’m never going to be six foot tall and stick thin.

'I really love my body and I love all bodies – we all have such an amazing beauty that can just shine out of us.’

Champion swimmer Libby Trickett has learnt to love her 'wobbly bits' since retirement

Trickett’s philosophy is to ‘embrace your wobbly bits’.

‘It’s part of you and why can’t we love ourselves for what we are? ‘ she said. ‘I’m very lucky because my husband loves my wobbly bits and embraces them, and thinks I look fabulous, which is very nice for the ego.'

She encourages everyone to take on her refreshing attitude to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

‘I eat really well without restricting myself, so if I want to have pizza or ice cream I do but obviously all in moderation,’ she said. 'I exercise, I’m strong, fit and really healthy, and if this is the weight I come to naturally then why not enjoy it and be happy with it?’

Trickett has had to learn how to allow herself to be hungry.

‘It’s been quite a process for me because I have never been hungry in my life because as an athlete you are constantly fuelling yourself, so I’ve had to learn hunger and understand if I am hungry or I'm just eating because that’s what I’m used to doing,' she said. 'That’s the issue I got into in 2010 - I was just constantly feeding.’
