Mario Balotelli looked to be relishing another opportunity with Italy on Wednesday as he trained with the rest of Antonio Conte's squad in Florence.

The controversial Liverpool striker was not included in either of Conte's first two squads after he took charge following Cesare Prandelli's decision to quit following the World Cup.

But the 24-year-old is now back in favour and could start when the Azzurri host Croatia in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday evening.

Balotelli, who scored against England in Brazil as Italy were dumped out at in the group stage along with the Three Lions, was pictured putting himself about in training as Conte's men continued their preparations for their Group H clash against Luka Modric and Co.

The former AC Milan forward looked to be enjoying himself as he tussled with Daniele Rugani, challenged Giorgio Chiellini in the air and nearly kicked a team-mate in the head while trying an audacious flick.

Balotelli faces competition from Borussia Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile - who he aimed a playful kick at in training - and Southampton star Graziano Pelle for a place in Conte's starting XI.

Pelle scored on his international debut last month as Italy continued their perfect start to qualifying with a 1-0 win against Malta.

They currently sit second in their group behind Sunday's opponents Croatia, who are yet to concede a goal in wins against Bulgaria, Azerbaijan and Malta. 

Speaking about Balotelli earlier this week, Conte said: 'I'm worried that people see Balotelli differently to the others.

'Balotelli is a normal footballer, just like the others. We don't need to differentiate Balotelli from the others, he's just one of the 23 players.

'Balotelli has significant experience with the national team, he has played at a World Cup and a European Championship, but that's not enough.

'He needs to catch my eye and I have to see if he can adapt to our type of football.

'If he can, he can play in the starting line-up, but he can also be on the bench or in the stands.'
