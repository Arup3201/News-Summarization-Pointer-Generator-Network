Costly canine: John Bell and 15-month-old border collie Bob. Bob is the most expensive sheepdog ever sold

A sheepdog has bounded into the record books after being sold for nearly £10,000 at auction.

Border collie Bob became the most expensive working sheepdog in the world when a bidder agreed to hand over £9,240 for him.

The staggering price smashed the previous record for an official sale, set at £8,400 in October last year.

Retired farmer and champion dog trainer John Bell, 82, bought Bob as a 13-week-old pup, for £315.

Now, at 15 months, he has become Mr Bell's third record-breaking sale in three years.

Mr Bell, of Howden, East Yorkshire, said: 'He has been working since he was nine months old. He is a natural and I was expecting a lot of him.

'He has a brilliant character but it wasn't his character he was bought for, it's his ability.

'His ability made him stand out. He is a very good dog. Everybody who saw him thought the same.'

The farmer described Bob as 'one of the best I've seen', adding: 'One of the biggest skills is spotting the potential in a young dog.

'Young dogs are like children, some learn quicker than others, but the aim is to produce an outstanding one.'

Mr Bell started training sheepdogs as a teenager, selling them to local farmers for between £15 and £20.

'I realised I had a bit of knack for it, but gave up when I started farming on my own in Lancashire,' he said. 'When I retired 15 years ago I started training sheepdogs again as a hobby, and it has turned into a passion.'

Bob went under the hammer at auction for £9,240 to a mystery buyer

He did not seem surprised by the high 
price, saying: 'All this fuss for an expensive dog, but what do people 
spend on their hobbies, like golf? People spend tens of thousands on 
their hobbies.'

The name of the winning bidder at 
Skipton Auction Mart is not known, but it is thought Bob is destined for
life in the United States.

Previous dogs sold by Mr Bell at the venue have gone on to win national sheepdog trials.
