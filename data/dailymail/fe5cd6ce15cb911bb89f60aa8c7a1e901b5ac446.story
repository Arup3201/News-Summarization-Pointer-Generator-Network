Steve Rayer, 44, has cancelled a fete, concerts, a disco and a pantomime trip which his primary pupils were looking forward to

A headmaster has been branded a Scrooge after calling off a series of Christmas celebrations because school inspectors are visiting.

Steve Rayer, 44, has cancelled a fete, concerts, a disco and a pantomime trip which his primary pupils were looking forward to.

He sent parents a letter saying the events would have to be rearranged, even though the inspectors have since stressed their presence should not interrupt normal school routines.

One mother compared Mr Rayer to the Grinch, the character who ‘stole Christmas’ in the children’s book by Dr Seuss.

She said: ‘It’s something the children look forward to all year.  The children are really disappointed thanks to this Scrooge – there have been lots of tears and lots of upset parents.’

Rogerstone Primary School in Newport, South Wales, sent letters to the parents of its 400 pupils  last week announcing the inspection by officials from Estyn, the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted, starting on December 9.

Mr Rayer wrote: ‘The Christmas panto and concerts will be rearranged in the new year. The Christmas fete and Christmas disco will be rearranged after the inspection is over. More details will be sent out when new arrangements have been made.

‘We are all very much looking forward to the visit by Estyn to show them the wonderful work everyone does here and how well the children progress in their learning.’ The mother, who has an eight-year-old at the school, said the children had been excited about the  trip to see the panto Beauty and the Beast at the Riverfront Theatre and Arts Centre in Newport.

She added: ‘It’s difficult to see how they are going to do Christmas stuff in the new year. It’s such a shame.

‘The children are seeing their friends at other schools celebrating but they’ve got to work on as normal. It’s usually the highlight of the year for them. As soon as the panto finishes one year they are looking forward to the next one.

‘And lots of the little girls had bought new dresses for the disco – it just means so much to them at that age.’

Acting head Mr Rayer, who has experience of three inspections at other schools, declined to comment.

He joined the school in October after the previous head took temporary leave pending an investigation into how reading and numeracy tests were carried out. Mr Rayer, a rugby coach and keen angler, was photographed last year with the Olympic torch when its round-Britain tour passed near the school.

Newport Council said it was up to the school to decide on Christmas events.

An Estyn spokesman said: ‘We would never recommend any school should cancel any Christmas activities or day-to-day events because of an inspection.’

Mr Rayer agreed to reinstate Christmas at Rogerstone Primary School following the publication of this article.

A school spokesman said: 'The children would have been out of the classrooms a lot that week.

'It is vitally important for the school, including its pupils and their parents, to be examined by Estyn and understand how well it is performing.

'However, following discussions with some parents and Estyn it was agreed to reinstate the children's trip to the pantomime.

'The school would like to thank those parents who have shown their support and understanding in relation to the issues it was facing.

'We would reassure everyone that Christmas will most definitely be celebrated at Rogerstone Primary.'
