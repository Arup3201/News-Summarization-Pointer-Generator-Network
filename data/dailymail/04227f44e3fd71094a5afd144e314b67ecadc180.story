One entrepreneur has made a business from combining her two favourite things: shoes and chocolate.

Azra Sadiq, a teacher-turned-chocolatier, has begun a business creating shoes made from chocolate and her idea has even caught the eye of Dragon's Den's Theo Paphitis.

The businessman was so impressed with Azra's sweet idea that he recently tweeted about her business, Azra Chocolates, as one of the six companies he selects each Sunday to re-tweet to his 355,000 followers on the social networking site.

A sweet idea: Azra Sadiq has turned her hand to creating chocolate shoes, which she describes as combining her two favourite things

Speaking on her website, Azra writes: 'Whilst I loved my career teaching English, I’ve always loved something else that little bit more – chocolate!

'So much so that I decided to start teaching myself more about how to make and create my own artisan chocolates in my kitchen in the Middle East.'

Every girl's dream: Azra loved chocolate so much that she decided to start teaching herself more about how to make and create her own artisan chocolates in her kitchen

Branching out: She has expanded her business to include purses and even mini shoes, which she says are ideal for wedding or birthday gifts

Soon her passion for chocolate combined with her creative flair took over, and her business was born. 

She studied with Master Chocolatiers in Belgium and the UK and is currently based in Harrogate, North Yorkshire where she creates each and every handcrafted shoe.

The dragon: Her shoes, which she sells for £21.95 each, even caught the eye of Theo Paphitis who tweeted about them

Impressed: The businessman was so impressed with Azra's idea that he  tweeted about her business as one of the six he selects each Sunday to re-tweet to his 3,500 followers on the social networking site

She has even expanded her business to include mini versions of her favourite footwear, which she says are ideal for wedding gifts and birthday presents.

She sells her chocolate shoes for £21.95 each and £36.95 for a pair.

'My work combines the fashionista in every woman with the highest quality taste experience – not to mention the two things women love the most, chocolate and shoes!' she added.
