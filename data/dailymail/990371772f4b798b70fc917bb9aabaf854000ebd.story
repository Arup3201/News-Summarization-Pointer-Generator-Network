Alan Pardew has warned of a testing start to Newcastle's season and believes his seven summer signings should be afforded time to adapt to the Premier League.

The Magpies kick off their campaign at home to champions Manchester City on Sunday with the manager under pressure to return on a £40million close-season investment by owner Mike Ashley.

In his last game at St James' Park Pardew was subject to howls of disapproval from supporters who had seen their side lose 14 of 19 matches.

But the 53-year-old survived and will return to the Milburn Stand touchline in front of a sell-out crowd.

Only then will we be able to gauge the forgiveness precipitated by the arrival of players such as France midfielder Remy Cabella, Ajax captain Siem de Jong and Holland right-back Daryl Janmaat.

Pardew, though, is guarded against promising an instant return.

'I don't like setting targets myself with the team,' he said.

'What we do also need to understand - and I know people are saying it's desperate that I need a fast start after what happened at the back end of last year – is that I think that's going to be difficult because we have got a lot of new players.

'So I am kind of preparing myself for an even start, if I am honest, and to get stronger as we go along.'

Pardew is happy with the make-up of his squad and has publicly thanked Ashley for sticking by him after the trials of last season.

There remains the chance of a late move for QPR's Loic Remy – who scored 14 times on loan at Newcastle last season – but the boss is confident that goals already reside in his team.

Pardew's side failed to score in 13 of their final 21 matches last time around, but he said: 'We have had some good strikers here - Papiss (Cisse) had that fabulous year and Demba Ba. Since I have been here they have been terrific, and Loic, obviously, last year on loan.

'I do think that we have got one or two players in that dressing room who can emulate those guys. To emulate Alan Shearer or Malcolm Macdonald, I think that's a bit tougher, but those recent guys we have had, I think so, yes.'

Emmanuel Riviere – a £6m signing from Monaco - will lead the line against City. He outscored Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez last season after netting 13 times, mainly from the bench.

And Pardew is confident the 24-year-old can prove to be his next big goalscoring hit on Tyneside.

'I think he's a player that was stuck at Monaco behind some unbelievable footballers,' he said of the former France Under-21 forward.

'All he could was come on to the pitch and score if he got the chance, and he did that, so he didn't do too much wrong there.

'We're fairly fortunate to have him and we think he's a player who can grow.

'I like his attitude and he's hungry with a good mentality. He's a different type of player to Papiss.

'I just hope everything falls for him at the football club. I have been fairly successful here with strikers and hopefully he will be a success too.'

Pardew will certainly be hoping that proves the case. For while he has tried to temper expectation by reminding fans of his new-look team, memory of the old one still lingers.

To that end, Pardew needs to start well, for 'even' – as the manager has predicted - might not be enough to pacify some supporters.
