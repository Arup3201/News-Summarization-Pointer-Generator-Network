The 22-year-old Utah man killed while attempting to swing from a large rock arch made popular by YouTube has been pictured.

Kyle Lee Stocking, of West Jordan, died about 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, after hitting the ground below the 140-foot-tall Corona Arch near Moab according to Grand County sheriff's officials.

Sheriff's Lt. Kim Neal told The Salt Lake Tribune the length of rope from the arch was miscalculated and sent Stocking swinging into the ground as he went under the red sandstone formation.

Grieving: In a statement Stocking's parents say their grief is only amplified by knowing his death could have been easily prevented

Rescuers say he was dead at the scene. He was with five friends at the time of his death.

‘It is the most tragic experience to receive the phone call
from the sheriff letting you know that your son has been killed in a terrible
accident that could have been avoided. It is the most awful experience a parent
could go through,’ Stocking's parents, Mike and Linda Stocking, said in a statement obtained by the Deseret News.

‘We hope and pray that there will be no more parents experiencing
what we are going through. There is a huge hole in our hearts.’

Viral videos have bolstered the activity of swinging under the arch, which involves using rock climbing ropes and jumping from near the top of the arch.

One video titled 'World's Largest Rope 
Swing' has racked up more than 17 million views on YouTube since it was 
posted in February.

'Pendulum' swinging is a relatively new form of recreation in Utah's canyon lands, which see plenty of injuries and deaths from rock climbing and BASE jumping, which involves leaping from a fixed object with a parachute.

On March 13, another man, Zachery Taylor, was killed rappelling at Tear Drop Arch in Utah's Monument Valley.

It's part of the recreational 'craziness' sweeping the Moab area, where the annual Jeep Safari week got started Saturday, another potentially dangerous activity that involves rock crawling in modified vehicles, said John Weisheit, of Living Rivers, a local environmental group.

'People aren't accepting nature for what it is. They have to put an element of excitement into it,' said Weisheit, a longtime rafting guide. 'People see it on YouTube and then say, "That looks like fun."'

Stocking was with a group of five friends authorities didn't identify. His family in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan couldn't be reached Monday.

It wasn't immediately clear how Stocking or his friends miscalculated the distance for a wild swing through Corona Arch.

Sheriff's Lt. Kim Neal said Stocking left too much rope loose when he clipped into his waist harness.

'A lot of people are doing it around 
here,' said Sean Hazell at Moab outfitter Western Spirit Cycling, who 
was planning to make his own jump from the top of Corona Arch. 'I'm 
definitely going to think twice about it now.'

Corona Arch is on Utah state trust lands but is set to be turned over to a federal land-management agency as part of a larger trade of state and federal lands.

Because of the accident, the Bureau of Land Management is 'taking a closer look at appropriate ways to balance and manage these activities on public lands,' BLM spokeswoman Megan Crandall said Monday.

The Utah Trust Lands Administration tried to curb Corona Arch's growing appeal by banning commercial outfitters from taking
 paying clients to the arch for for the rope swing activity as it 
rapidly gained popularity online.

But the agency said it can't prevent private parties from using its lands. The agency posted a trailhead warning about the potential for 'severe injury or death even if your equipment works.'

Stocking's rope and harness didn't fail. His mistake was miscalculating the length of slack rope for the swing, Neal said.

'These people involved in extreme outdoor sports, I admire their courage, but I'm not going to do it,' Neal said.
