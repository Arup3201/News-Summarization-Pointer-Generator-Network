Female MPs who complain about how macho politics are not the victims of sexism but simply ‘useless’, Ann Widdecombe has claimed.

The outspoken former Tory minister dismissed the idea that Westminster was biased against women, and insisted both sexes were ‘roughed up’ during debates.

In remarks likely divide opinion in Parliament, Miss Widdecombe said women must not go into politics with a ‘sense of grievance’.

Outspoken: Former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe warned female MPs not to enter politics with a 'sense of grievance'

Miss Widdecombe, who was prisons minister in John Major’s last government, insisted those women who do choose a career in politics had to prove their commitment, and realise having a family might not be conducive to the rough and tumble of life in Westminster.

She lashed out against the 101 female New Labour MPs swept into Parliament by Tony Blair;s landslide election in 1997.

Miss Widdecombe said too many of them thought they were treated rudely by opponents because they were women – when I fact they just were not very good.

Babes: Many of the women swept into Parliament by Tony Blair's first New Labour landslide in 1997 were not up to the job, Miss Widdecombe suggested

Useless: The 101 female Labour MPs 'might as well have been the 101 Dalmations'

She said: ‘I vividly remember that about six months after the Blair Babes came in – you may remember them? 101 of them came in and I always thought they might as well have had the 101 Dalmations.

‘About sixth months afterwards, one of them came up to me in the corridor and she said to me: “Ann, isn’t it horrible how the men are so rude to us?”

‘And I said “yes, and isn’t it horrible how they are so rude to each other?” And she hadn’t thought of that.

‘She had just been roughed up in the chamber, she had assumed it was because she was a woman. In fact it was because she was useless,’ she said speaking at the Telegraph Ways With Words festival.

A frequent critic of David Cameron’s leadership of the Tory party, Miss Widdecombe criticised the use of A-lists and ‘positive discrimination’ when selecting candidates to fight elections.

Commitment: Miss Widdecombe has said she would like to have been a mother, but that would not have been compatible with running for Parliament

When she was selected in the 1980s ‘it did take quite a long time for everybody, male and female, to get into Westminster’.

Travelling around the country in search of a seat was a test of commitment and ability, she said.

'Supposing you had a family: If you were doing what I had to do - which was to go up to the north every week to the constituency for 18 months - it would be quite a difficult commitment to make. So it would be quite a serious test.'

She added: ‘I do urge women who are interested in going into politics not to enter it with this tremendous sense of grievance.

‘I went to Westminster to thinking of myself as a women MP at all, but an MP who happened to be a woman. I expected to be treated the same as the men and I was.’

Last month she revealed her desire to have had children – but insisted it would have made becoming an MP impossible.

‘I’d have liked to have been a full-time mother, although I say that with the wisdom of hindsight,’ she told the Mail on Sunday.

‘I certainly wouldn’t have gone into politics. It’s not the hours, but the geographical distance – Mum doesn’t come home till midnight – I would not have done that.’
