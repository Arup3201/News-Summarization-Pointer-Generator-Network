Alexandra O'Shea refused to pay the £75 on-the-spot fine she was given for throwing her cigarette butt out of her car window - and was eventually ordered to pay more than £1,000

A motorist who threw a cigarette end out of her car window has been ordered to pay more than £1,000 after she refused to pay a £75 on-the-spot fine.

Alexandra O’Shea, 20, was spotted by two Police Community Support Officers as she wound down her window and flicked the butt into the street as she drove through Bristol.

They flagged her down and issued her with a fine for littering, but when she didn't pay it, Bristol City Council took O'Shea to court.

Bristol Magistrates' Court heard that
 O’Shea, from Bedminster Down, Bristol, was driving through the Bristol 
suburb of Hartcliffe last summer when she wound down her car window and 
flicked out the butt.

Carol Donovan, a street scene officer for Bristol City Council, said: 'We wrote to her telling her that if she did not pay that we would take her to court.

'She ignored this, and failed to turn up when the case was heard, despite reminders, and then magistrates obviously took her behaviour very seriously.'

O'Shea was ordered to pay a fine of £600, costs of £361.08, and a £60 victim surcharge.

Jonquil Maudlin, council neighbourhood enforcement manager, said: 'People should be aware that cigarette ends are just as much litter as anything else, and they take a long time to biodegrade, as they are made not of paper, but of plastic filament.

'They are full of toxic chemicals and it has been found that many have been found in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals who mistake them for food.'

Andy Walker, from the Keep Britain Tidy Campaign, said: 'People tend to think that littering is a victimless crime but the reality is it affects us all.

'According to research, littering costs the country around £1 billion every single year, and it is a major cost for councils such as Bristol City Council.

'Every time someone drops litter in the street, we are all having to pay to clean it up.  If this person had paid the fine and not ignored the court letters then she would not have got herself in such a mess.'
