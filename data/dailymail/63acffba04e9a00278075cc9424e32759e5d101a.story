The father and sister of a NSW firefighter have been killed after their family homes went up in flames last night 

Emergency services were called to the two-storey house in Valley Close at Bayview at about 2.40am.

The firefighter's mother made it out of the burning home  in the early hours of Sunday morning after neighbours pulled her out of a window.

She was taken to hospital with a suspected broken leg.

But a man in his 70s and a woman in her 40s were unable to escape the blazing inferno. 

Delays occurred in the search for the missing family members ad fire crews were forced to wait until the scene was deemed safe enough to enter.

The split-level house which was built with western red cedar and built into the side of a hill, has been completely destroyed and the father and daughter are believed to have been buried under the rubble.

Commissioner Greg Mullins told 9 News said his heart went out to the firefighter and his family, who he knows well. 

'We deal with tragedy on a daily basis  you try and harden yourself to it, but when it's one of your own it's very very difficult,' he said. 

'I come from the northern beaches and because I know the person concerned, it's pretty tough.'
