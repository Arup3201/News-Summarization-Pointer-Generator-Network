'I love to capture atmospheric landscapes and I'm drawn to night and early morning light,' says Lagerstedt

He focused on shooting on the horizon line, and the images highlight the wild landscapes that he calls home. He began taking the striking photos in 2012 and has continued to travel to the edge of Finland.

'My first inspiration towards photography came when I was driving to my relatives cabin after one rainy day and when the sun was about to set. I saw this beautiful landscape filled with fog and sunlight, and at that moment I made a decision to start capture those wonderful sights.

'I love to capture atmospheric landscapes and I'm drawn to night and early morning light.

I shot these images in Finland, either by the coast or far away from the cities.'

The photographer lives in Kerava just 30 kilometres from Helsinki, but has travelled to the very edge of Finland

Capturing simplistic Finnish landscapes and fleeting moments, he strives to use his atmospheric vision to inspire people. His photography has been featured around the world in book covers, magazines and in advertisements.
