A mother is outraged after her daughter, a second grader at a Las Vegas elementary school, was forced to urinate in front of her classmates while the school was on lock-down.

Shay Jones said that her daughter, a student at Ruth Fyfe Elementary School, was told to pee inside of a trash can in her classroom while other students were present and taunting her.

Fox reports that the school was on a lock-down because of a report citing a suspicious person in the area.

Shay Jones is outraged at the school's lock-down policy which forced her daughter to urinate in front of her peers

Both teachers and students are not permitted to leave their classrooms during a lock-down and the school says that the teacher was merely following instructions put in place by the school district.

'You do not, I repeat, do not put a child on a nasty school trash can with a hard napkin, cover the corner with a partition, put on music so the other students can't hear. You just don't do that,' Jones told Fox.

The Clark County School district replied with this response, 'Lock-down procedures in the district are utilized in emergency situations or when there is a perceived threat to safety.

During a lock-down, staff and students are told not to leave their work or classrooms for safety reasons. The district will look into this situation to determine if additional staff training is needed to prepare for future situations.'

Jones says whether the school is meant to keep kids in the classroom or not she'd like an official apology.

Ruth Fyfe Elementary School is set up in such a way that students need to go outside the building in order to go to the bathroom, hence why the send-grader was forced to stay inside during lock-down

'I contacted the school. I got nothing. Not even an apology,' Jones said.

Jones told reporters that her daughter is traumatized after the incident and fears for her child's mental health should other students continue to make fun of her.

The school district responded to the event with the following statement, 'Ruth Fyfe Elementary School is an outdoor school and there is no way for this student to access a restroom without exiting the safety of the locked-down building.

A lock-down situation can last a few minutes or several hours, depending on the situation. When a lock-down is instituted, it is normal for teachers and staff to be unaware of how long the school or building will remain in lock-down status. In this situation, the teacher accommodated this student to avoid having the student urinate on his or herself, and create a possible health issue.'Since the bathroom was outside of the building, the school saw exiting the classroom as a safety issue.
