The striking similarities that began with the month they were born and have marked their sporting lives now include the island Justin Rose and Adam Scott call home.

While Rose has moved into contention to win The Open, his wife Kate has been putting the finishing touches to their move from Orlando to the Bahamas, about a stone’s throw from where Scott and his new bride live.

And so the pair will share a private jet to tournaments as well as walk the fairways together. They will try to coax one another into making the next five years a period where they leave a mark as indelible as the one Sir Nick Faldo and Greg Norman left before them.

Close connections: Adam Scott and Justin Rose are now neighbours on the same island in the Bahamas

Rivalry: Rose and Scott were born a fortnight apart and are now world No 3 and No 1 respectively

Now entrenched in the world’s top three, they have become so good there are inevitably going to be a number of tournaments over the next five years where they will face off - and there might even be one on Sunday.

Rose shot a useful 70 in the capricious breezes to move to two under, with Scott edging a stroke nearer the lead after finishing birdie-birdie for a 73. ‘Lunch will certainly taste a lot nicer now,’ said the Queenslander.

To this point, Scott has been like the over-achieving big brother, always getting to landmarks about a year ahead of Rose, who is a fortnight younger (Scott was 34 on Wednesday while Rose will reach that age at the end of the month).

Both have won European Tour events, PGA Tour events, World Golf Championship events and a major apiece - but it was Scott who got there first each time. Given the eerie parallels, it seems almost inevitable Rose will follow in Scott’s footsteps and become world No 1 at some point. If he wins the Claret Jug, it will happen here.

In contention: Scott and Rose are three-under and two-under at The Open behind Rory McIlroy's 12-under

‘I’m pleased with that round. It was very difficult out there and I couldn’t have asked for more,’ said Rose.  

The pair must have chuckled to themselves when they saw the draw. As if they don’t spend enough time in each other’s company. It was fascinating watching their strategies over the first 36 holes.

Who’s going to win the most majors? I asked that question of Graeme McDowell not long ago and, typically, he gave it some thought.

‘About 15 months ago, I’d have said Adam without a moment’s hesitation,’ said G-Mac, eventually. ‘Now? That’s a very close call. How will Adam cope when the ban on long putters begins in 2016? I’d say Adam will win four majors and Justin three, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was the other way round.’

Benchmark: Australian Scott is top of the world rankings now, but could be dethroned as soon as Sunday

Good fortune plays its part and both were unlucky to get the wrong end of the draw over the first two days, given they came here in the form of their lives.

A three-under-par 36-hole total is about the worst Scott could have recorded, given how well he struck the ball. Predictably, Rose suffered a letdown in his first round since claiming his second win in a row at the Scottish Open last week. The important thing was a 72 didn’t take him out of it.

So they began Friday morning, fully aware this was a day for patience. On the first three holes, Scott was never out of the middle of the fairway, had a wedge in his hand for two of his three approach shots - and walked to the fourth tee two over par. 

Satisfied: England's Rose said he was 'pleased' with his second round in tough conditions

Rose’s round was a classic case in point. He was one over after eight, with nothing happening on the greens. Then he chipped in for a birdie at the ninth and an eagle three at the 10th.

How well they putt over the next five years will largely determine their legacy. Their ball- striking is unquestioned, as is their ambition. But neither hole prodigious amounts of putts. Scott gave himself so many chances but invariably the chance passed with a grimace on his lips rather than a smile. Rose never holed a putt all day.

But both are in contention, with Scott one stride ahead of Rose going into the weekend. The story of their lives, you might say.
