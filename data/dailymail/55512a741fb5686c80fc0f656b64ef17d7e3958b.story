Dennis Igo, 53, admitted 16 charges relating to making and possessing indecent images of children aged five. He has been spared jail

A businessman who spent four hours a day looking at his collection of more than a quarter of a million child porn images has been spared an immediate jail term.

Dennis Igo, 53, of Bronington, near Wrexham, was in possession of at least 255,667 indecent still images and 834 videos, but was given a suspended prison sentence and 300 hours of community service.

Now his MP Susan Elan Jones has slammed the sentence as 'pitiful and inadequate', and has written to Attorney General Dominic Grieve, demanding it be reviewed.

Igo admitted 16 charges relating to making and possessing indecent images of children aged five to 14 between January 2006 and March 
2013 when he appeared before Mold Crown Court.

The court was told he may have had many more images, but police did not have the resources to examine them all.

Igo was given a suspended prison sentence and sent on a specialist internet sex offender course because of his 'exceptional circumstances'.

It was accepted at Mold Crown Court that Igo, described as a successful businessman, became addicted to pornography when he suffered financial difficulties not of his making. He was said to have lost his life savings.

Igo was also said to be 'in a very dark place' after his wife received treatment and surgery for breast cancer.

The defendant told police that at the time he searched 'little breasts' on the internet, child porn sites appeared, and he started viewing them.

He ended up being addicted - looking at them daily for up to three or four hours a day.

Igo also admitted possessing extreme 
images involved sexual intercourse between humans and animals, which 
included horses and dogs.

Nicholas Williams, defending, said 
that his client had acted under stress and was relieved when the matter 
was brought to an end by his arrest.

He had sought help and counselling and was motivated to tackle the root of his problems.

The defendant was unable to explain why he had done it.

Judge Niclas Parry told the defendant he had been viewing the suffering of abused children, but added there had been exceptional mitigating circumstances and that the probation service had taken the view that he could be safely managed in the community.

He received a two-year prison sentence suspended for two years, and told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work, as well as being placed on a supervision order. As a condition of this supervision, he must attend 36 sessions of an internet sex offender treatment programme.

The judge also ordered him to register with the police as a sex offender for ten years and made a ten-year sexual offences prevention order (SOPO) to restrict his future conduct.

One of the conditions bans him from downloading any images of children from the Internet.

Ms Jones, Labour MP for Clwyd South, has asked the Attorney General for an urgent review of the sentence.

In the letter, she said: 'Mr Igo has pleaded guilty to some extremely disturbing charges and I feel that the sentence awarded is totally inadequate when one considers the crimes that have been committed.

'I urge you to take action on this matter and to review this case in depth. On behalf of the victims involved in Mr Igo's 'collection' and the local community which I represent, I ask that you take whatever action is available to you to see that justice is done in this case.'

Dennis Igo, 53, of Bronington, near Wrexham, was in possession of at least 255,667 indecent still images and 834 videos, but was given a suspended prison sentence and 300 hours of community service at Mold Crown Court.

She later added: 'I have heard from many constituents in Bronington over the weekend and they are all as horrified as I am. It's relatively unusual for an MP to ask the Attorney General to review an individual case but I will not let this matter rest.'

Ms Jones said she was horrified that the same judge recently gave a two-year custodial sentence for a currency scam, which she said seemed to be a discrepancy.

'It is extraordinary that there is no immediate custodial sentence is this case,' she said.

'There were well over a quarter of a million images - because of the numbers police could not extract them all - over seven years, involving a large number of films of children being abused.

'Many people in Bronington are very concerned and I can understand that.

'It makes you wonder who does get a custodial sentence.'
