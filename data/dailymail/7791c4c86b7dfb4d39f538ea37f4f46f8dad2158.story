Tributes have been paid to two men murdered in a 'ferocious' ambush by a hooded gang as police scour CCTV to identify who killed them.

Aaron Carriere, 21, and Josiah Manful, 
20, were both repeatedly stabbed after their black Ford Fiesta was 
stopped in Montague Road, Leytonstone, in the early hours of Saturday morning.

A gang of hooded attackers surrounded the car, leaving Mr Carriere with fatal knife wounds to his neck and Mr Manful with stab wounds to the chest.

There are concerns the dead men were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time', with friends saying the pair went to church weekly and has no involvement in crime.

Shantelle
 Limbard, 23, told the Evening Standard: 'They were funny, kind, bubbly, outgoing and very 
charismatic. They had hearts of gold and always had big smiles. If you 
needed something because you didnâ€™t have any money or whatever they 
would always help you out. Itâ€™s such a shock. We have no idea who would 
want to do this.'

Mr Manful's sister 
Claudia said in an online tribute: 'I'll never wish death on anyone, but I hope the 
people that took Aaron and Josiah's lives conscience eats away at them.'

Police say they are not sure of any motive.

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Attewell said: 'At the moment it's not clear why these two men were targeted and murdered.

'My appeal is threefold. I'm appealing to witnesses to the attack, I'm appealing for information from those who may know those responsible, and we need to understand why these two men were murdered.

'It's too early to speculate on why they were murdered and we're keeping an open mind about the circumstances behind these murders, and I urge the community and members of the public to do the same.'

Tributes: Flowers with notes from bereft family and loved-ones of the pair have been laid at the scene

One note said: 'To Aaron and Josiah, I can't believe what has happened to my good friends! You will forever be in our hears & will never be forgotten, may you both rest in peace. Love from Paris & Family'

Mr Attewell said that witnesses can have their identities protected.

He added: 'There were several suspects and they were all hooded. They attacked both sides of the car simultaneously and attacked the two victims Josiah and Aaron while they were sitting in the car.

'They were stabbed several times, they suffered significant injuries. The attack can only be described as ferocious.

'It's likely that these suspects are speaking about what happened and people are hearing them speak about it.

'Information can be treated in confidence, my team are specialist homicide investigators and there are several methods we can use to protect people's identities.'

He would not discuss whether either of the men were already known to the police or whether the murder may have been linked to a gang.

Mr Attewell said: 'We need to understand why these two men were murdered and obviously we are looking into their backgrounds to see if there is anything in their backgrounds that will help us.'

Police are scouring through CCTV footage to piece together the run-up to the murders and try to identify the killers.

'The events immediately before these two young lads were murdered are crucial for us to understand,' Mr Attewell said.

'We're looking for CCTV footage over a very wide area trying to see the movements of the victims and to identify the suspects on the footage and to piece together the events leading up to it.'

Post-mortem examinations found the cause of death for Mr Carriere was given as stab wounds to the neck while the cause of death for Mr Manful was given as shock and haemorrhaging, and stab wounds to the chest.
