A vandal thought to be as young as four was captured on CCTV vandalising a father-of-two's Audi on Mother's Day. 

David Draper was horrified when footage on his home security camera showed the boy running a key along the side of his grey car. 

The 37-year-old from Crosby in Liverpool said the vandalism took place at around lunchtime on Mother's Day. 

The youngster was seen pulling a sharp object or key out of his pocket and running it along the side of the Audi

Two seemingly older children are seen walking along the street ahead of the younger boy in the video. 

The child is seen calmly pulling what appears to be a key from the pocket of his grey tracksuit, all the while maintaining his pace. 

He runs the object along Mr Draper's car, leaving a long, white scratch.

The father of two claims his was not the only car on the quiet residential street to have been damaged last Sunday.  

'I've lived here for five years, it’s a nice area. Nothing like this has happened before.

'This young boy scratched my car in the street and was seemingly allowed to do so.

'I don’t know who the children are. I knocked on the doors of my neighbours and have discovered their cars have also been damaged as well.

'I’m hoping I’ll be able to just paint over it but it’s still damaged. I don’t recognise the older boy or any of the children.' 

Mr Draper is now planning to report the incident to police after having been unable to identify the children in the video by speaking to neighbours.  

Mr Draper said other cars on the quiet residential street had been damaged on Mothers Day afternoon
