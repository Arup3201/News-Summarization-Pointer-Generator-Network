Probe: Altaf Hussain, the leader of Pakistan's powerful Muttahida Qaumi Movement, (pictured in September 2010) has been arrested on suspicion of money laundering

Police have arrested one of Pakistan's most well-known and divisive politicians on suspicion of money-laundering, sparking fears of violence in his power base of Karachi where businesses closed early and residents rushed home.

Altaf Hussain, the leader of Pakistan's powerful Muttahida Qaumi Movement, or MQM, was being quizzed by police this afternoon, as officers searched the house where he was arrested.

Hussain, 60, has lived in self-imposed exile in Britain since 1992, believing that his life would be at risk were he to return, but he regularly addresses large gatherings in Pakistan by telephone link.

He is known for his stirring speeches that can whip his followers into a frenzy, and news of his arrest sparked fears of violence in his home base of Karachi.

The
 Metropolitan police confirmed that a 60-year-old man had been arrested 
earlier today when asked about Hussain, but refused to name him.

'Officers have this morning, Tuesday, June 3 arrested a 60-year-old man on suspicion of money laundering,' said a spokesman.

'The arrest took place at a residential address in north-west London.

'He has since been taken into custody at a central London police station and enquiries continue.

'Officers are at present searching the address.'

Police officers were seen removing possible evidence from Hussain's large red brick gated home this afternoon.

In 2010 another MQM politician, Imran Farooq, was stabbed to death in a daylight street attack in London.

The slaying triggered riots in Karachi, where the party has its biggest base of support. Police are yet to charge any suspects over the killing.

Hussain's arrest sent shockwaves through Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and economic hub.

Immediately after news of his arrest aired on Pakistani television shopkeepers and other business owners closed up and headed home, worried that his arrest could spark a violent backlash.

Mohammed Atiq Mir, chairman of the All Karachi Trade Association, said all markets in the city had closed. The British diplomatic mission in Karachi was temporarily closed, and the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad warned American citizens of the possibility of protests and unrest in the city.

The embassy said it was cancelling appointments for visas and American citizen services at the Karachi consulate on Wednesday.

Pakistan Railways halted train service in Karachi and the rest of Sindh province for three hours. In the past, demonstrators in Karachi have torched railway cars.

'My wife informed me of the arrest of Altaf Hussain, and everybody in the bank wanted to go home as soon as possible,' said Tariq Ali, a banker in Karachi.

Sobia Ahmed, who was waiting for her brother to pick her up, said her mother had called her and demanded she return home immediately.

'We are all aware of the history of this city,' Ms Ahmed said. 'After a major incident the city panics, and agitators rule the streets and roads.'

Meanwhile angry protesters in Karachi have torched buses, rickshaws and a car following the arrest of Hussain.

At least six buses, five auto-rickshaws and one car were destroyed, they said.

A senior MQM official, Nadeem Nusrat, appealed for calm.

'We appeal to all the workers to control your emotions,' he said.

However, despite the appeal there were 
reports of scattered violence across the city, according to senior police officer Pir
 Muhammed Shah, who said some vehicles had been burned and there 
were reports of people firing guns into the air.

MQM condemned the violence and said in a statement that the people behind it were not related to the party. 

Authorities have beefed up security at various parts of the city and at diplomatic missions, Mr Shah said.

Mr Nusrat said Hussain had been feeling unwell and was about to go to a hospital for medical tests when detectives arrived at his home with a search warrant.

The MQM, formed in 1984, largely represents descendants of Urdu-speaking migrants from India who settled in Pakistan when it was created in 1947.

The party portrays itself as a moderate and secular force. However, it has often been accused by competitors of using violence.
