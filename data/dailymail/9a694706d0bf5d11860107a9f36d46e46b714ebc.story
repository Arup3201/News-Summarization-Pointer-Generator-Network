Boris Johnson could be catapulted to the heart of the Tory election campaign because he outpolls David Cameron.

Conservative MPs liken Mr Johnson's appeal to lager brand Heineken, claiming he 'reaches the voters other politicians don't'.

A new poll shows the London Mayor's personal ratings are much higher than leaders of the main parties, as he sets out his brand of 'elementary One Nation Conservatism'.

Mr Johnson is poised to return to the Commons in May as MP for the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge and Ruislip.

But there are growing calls for him to front campaign events across the country in the run-up to polling day.

When Chancellor George Osborne launched the 'long-term economic plan for London', he did so with Mr Johnson at his side and not the Prime Minister. 

A new YouGov poll for The Times shows how Mr Johnson's popularity outstrips other senior politicians.

The survey of voters in London shows 63 per cent of voters think he is doing well in his job, while just 28 per cent say he is doing badly.

In a boost for the Tories, his popularity is also high among Ukip voters – despite his often outspoken attacks on Nigel Farage's party.

Some 60 per cent of Ukip supporters say Mr Johnson is doing well, with only 33 per cent saying badly.

By comparison, national surveys show other leaders are less popular. The latest personal ratings for Mr Cameron 43 per cent think he is doing well, but 51 per cent said badly, a net score of minus 8.

Ed Miliband has a net score of minus 46 per cent, with only 22 per cent saying he is doing well, while Nick Clegg has a net score of -51, with 19 per cent saying he is doing well.

YouGov's Anthony Wells said Mr Johns has a 'remarkable ability to appeal across party lines.'

'He even manages to attract net approval ratings of 47 per cent from Ukip voters. It is little wonder calls are growing for him to be deployed on a national campaign.'

Former Tory minister Stephen Hammond told The Times:: 'Boris is Heineken — he reaches the voters other politicians don't. The election is the politics of aspiration versus the politics of envy. Boris encapsulates the aspiration part of it and we should use him as a party in all sorts of parts of the country.'

Others want him to play 'a prominent national role' in the campaign to project a more 'positive and optimistic voice'.

Mr Johnson told the newspaper: 'All we're offering is a very simple prescription — to support wealth creation and business, but also make sure that the proceeds of that growth are used to help the poorest and the neediest. That is elementary One Nation Conservatism.'
