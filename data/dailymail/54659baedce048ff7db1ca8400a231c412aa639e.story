Scott Brown is poised to hand Celtic - and Scotland - a huge boost by returning to action three weeks ahead of schedule against Aberdeen on Saturday.

But Ronny Deila is facing a fresh injury blow with the news that midfielder Charlie Mulgrew faces weeks on the sidelines with a knee problem which could require surgery.

Skipper Brown was expected to be absent for three months after sustaining a hamstring problem in July. However, as he prepares to hand debuts to strikers John Guidetti and Stefan Scepovic against the Dons at Parkhead, Deila says Brown’s quicker-than-expected return feels like having another new player.

‘Scott looks very well. He could maybe play on Saturday,’ said the Celtic boss.

‘We are talking here about new signings but to also get injured players back is great.

‘Everybody knows how important Scott is to this team. He looks good and needs minutes under his belt.

‘It’s tough to get players the minutes they need at the top level to get their fitness back. But when we do that I see a very good team here.’

Brown sustained his injury in a pre-season match against Rapid Vienna and initial projections predicted a three-month lay-off.

His comeback will also be welcomed by national team Gordon Strachan ahead of next month’s Euro 2016 double header with Georgia and Poland, with Deila reporting: ‘Scott is training with the team well now. It’s positive and his body is improving quick so that’s good.’

The news is less positive for Deila and Strachan on Mulgrew, Brown’s club and country midfield partner.

After watching Mulgrew sent off in contentious circumstances by a Norwegian referee in Scotland’s 2-1 defeat to Germany last Sunday, Deila only wishes the red card flashed by his countryman had come earlier than the last minute.

‘Charlie is struggling with his knee now. I don’t know how long that is going to take to get better. That’s not positive.

‘It could be some weeks. He has a meniscus problem with his knee and it could need surgery, but I hope we don’t need to do that.’

Pleased to have a settled squad after the drama of transfer deadline day, Deila promises new faces against Derek McInnes’ Dons side.

Virgil van Dijk will also be restored to the first-team squad after bids for his services from Sunderland and Southampton were rejected – to the defender’s chagrin.

Left out of the 1-1 draw with Dundee as a result, the Dutchman spoke to Deila yesterday and assured fans the defender’s head is in the right place for the season ahead.

‘He (Van Dijk) is very happy now. He’s just become a dad and he’s been with his national team for the first time.

‘He was a little bit disappointed for a couple of days after the window closed. People want things and he was thinking he had the opportunity to go to the English Premier League.

‘But that wasn’t possible and he knows now he has a lot of challenges here as well. He is a very important player for Celtic and he has to take it as a positive. The way I saw him in training today, he has taken it fantastically well.

‘He has to understand how important he is. He is such an unbelievably good player for us. That’s something he has to be glad about. We would have said: “Go away, we don’t want you.” That would have been worse.’

Deila admits Celtic had to play hardball on deadline day, adding: ‘There was interest in him. But it was not even close to what we are thinking about. Also, we were not interested in selling him anyway. He is one of the players we are going to build a new team around.

‘He hasn’t said anything to me about speaking about it again in January. Again, you can never plan in football. Tomorrow, he could be injured or he could start playing fantastic and become a regular in the national team for Holland.

‘He has things to work on to get improvement. He played very well against Maribor, the standard he played was Champions League level. That’s why he was picked for Holland. So if he continues that, he will get his chances.

‘He said that to me as well, that if he plays good matches for Celtic, he will get opportunities.

‘I have no concerns about his commitment. I can honestly say I’m really happy about his situation and have no concerns. I can see his body language and he is happy. Now he is focused on getting good results with Celtic and getting better.’
