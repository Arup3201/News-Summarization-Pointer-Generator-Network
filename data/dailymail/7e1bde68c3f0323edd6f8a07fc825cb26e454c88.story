Tough love: Police say the 35-year-old woman armed her 11-year-old son with a pair of steak knives in preparation for the attack on a 16-year-old boy

Love's daughter tried to push the youngster away, but tripped and fell to the ground. That is when officials say the 16-year-old stood over the girl and pulled down his pants and underwear.

At that moment, Miss Love walked into the room and found the half-naked teenage boy with her daughter. The 16-year-old then fled Love's house.

When the 35-year-old mother learned what happened, she gathered six people, among them her 11-year-old son armed with a pair of steak knives measuring at 8 and 4 inches in length, and the whole group set out from Love's home on Sunshine Drive to deliver swift justice to the alleged molester.

'Mom took the gang and was going to kick some a**, or cut some a**, one or the other,' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told Philly.com.

Love and her band of vigilantes rang the doorbell of the boy's home on Avon Road near Madeira, where the 16-year-old was with his father and two brothers.

When the door opened, all seven intruders went inside, and Love's young son started swinging his two steak knives, according to police.

Then, his mother took one of the weapons from the boy's hands and started brandishing it in front of the teen and his family. No injuries have been reported.

The 16-year-old has been charged with attempted rape and sexual assault. Meanwhile, Love and her underage son are facing assault charges.
