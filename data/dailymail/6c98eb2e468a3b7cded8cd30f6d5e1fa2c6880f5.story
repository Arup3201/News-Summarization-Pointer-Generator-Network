Horses have been banned from marching in the World War I centenary ANZAC parade in Albany due to safety concerns.

Equestrians are outraged the chair of the event's organising committee, Major General Dave Chalmers said the horses were not allowed in the march because of the risk to the anticipated 60,000 visitors.

Major General Chalmers said the troop march was not a re-enactment and would be restricted to serving and ex-serving defence force members and cadets.

But the light horse would be recognised at other events in Albany over the ANZAC weekend, he said.

Australian Light Horse Association WA president Harry Ball said it was disappointing the committee had not discussed their concerns with the association before banning the horses.

Mr Ball said the horses had taken part in the Albany ANZAC march every year for the past 25 years as well as at events in Perth without causing an accident.

'If they'd just discussed with us the safety issues or maybe included us in planning for the day we could have reassured them,' Mr Ball said.

Mr Ball said the association was told the risk of people slipping on horse droppings had contributed to the ban.

Several talkback callers told Fairfax radio on Thursday that they would voluntarily pick up the droppings if it meant the horses could take part.

Only one Australian horse from the 136,000 sent overseas during World War I made it back.
