A food fight between senior citizens broke out at a Golden Corral this week which led to one 64-year-old woman being charged with assault and battery.

A plate of food went flying at the salad bar of a restaurant in Wilkesboro, North Carolina on Tuesday during the early bird dinner sitting.

The trouble broke out at 3.45pm after Polly Richards, 64, allegedly purposely bumped into Linwood Moore, 69, at the salad bar.

Showdown at the Golden Corrall: Polly Richards, 64, was charged with assault and battery after throwing a plate of food during an early bird dinner at the chain restaurant in Wilkesboro, North Carolina

According to witnesses and surveillance footage, Richards cursed at Mr Moore and pushed him against the wall and slapped him in the face, WITN reported.

Mr Moore, who recently had heart surgery, said he was afraid Richards was going to hurt him so he pushed her away, causing her to fall to the floor.

Richards also threw a plate of food which hit Fay Cardwell, 62, smashing into her shin and knee.

The altercation reportedly broke out because Mr Moore cut in front of Richards when she was getting a drink.

On arrest, Richards reportedly told officers: 'Just take me to the f****** jail then.'

The 64-year-old has been charged with two counts of assault and battery and is jailed on $1,500 bond.

Golden Corral refused to comment about the incident to MailOnline on Friday.
