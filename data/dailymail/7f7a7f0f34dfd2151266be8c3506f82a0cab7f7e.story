If you thought the sultry spring weather was too good to last, you were right.

Arctic winds from the Norwegian sea are on the way, bringing snow, frost and bitterly cold temperatures marking a stark contrast on last week. The biggest change comes for the village of Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, where the highest March temperature ever recorded gave a reading of 23.6C.

The Met Office today said that it was just 0.9C in Aboyne and has issued two severe weather warnings for snow in the area. Less than 30 miles down the road, the UK's lowest recording yesterday was -3.9C in Braemar.

In a marked contrast to last week, snow fell across a large part of Aberdeenshire. Here a farmer is seen feeding his sheep in Huntly earlier today after a fresh blanket of snow

These predict transport disruption, up
to eight inches of snow in northern Scotland and severe conditions in 
the north of England.

Up to two inches of snow are predicted for the North today bringing fun to children on Easter holidays but misery to motorists.

The Midlands faces similar amounts 
tomorrow, with the Home Counties seeing up to an inch on higher ground 
by the afternoon rush-hour and London facing sleet and snow, although it
is unlikely to settle.

Met Office forecaster Helen Waite 
said: ‘Northern England will see rain turn increasingly to snow on 
Monday night, with 5cm or so expected on high ground. Lower levels could
see 1cm or so but it will melt after settling.

Glorious: People enjoy the Minack Theatre at Porthcurno, Cornwall. Visitor numbers where down this weekend as the fuel crisis effected people traveling to the County. Those who did make it where treated to sunshine and empty beaches

Refreshing: Lisa Garratt from the Midlands enjoys a coffee at the Minack Theatre cafe over looking Porthcurno.

‘The Midlands is expected to see snow on Tuesday, with 2cm over higher ground, but snow unlikely to settle on lower ground.

‘The South could well see settling 
snow on Tuesday evening, with 2cm on the Chilterns, less than that on 
the Downs and snow also possible on higher ground in the South-West.

‘London and other lower areas could see sleet or snow, but it is unlikely to settle.

‘Wednesday will stay cold in a brisk 
north-easterly wind, with the risk of snow showers at lower levels, more
likely in the East including the South-East.’

Temperatures, which hit 23c (73f) in some parts last week, will plummet, with tomorrow night the most bitter.

Durham will be among the coldest spots
in England, with clear skies keeping temperatures as low as -6c (21f). 
The mercury will rise again from Thursday but Easter weekend is still 
likely to be rather gloomy.

The Met Office is predicting outbreaks of rain on Good Friday and a cloudy weekend.

However, temperatures should reach 12 
to 13c (54 to 55f) in the North and South, bringing them in line with 
the average for this time of year.

The big chill is in sharp contrast to 
the recent warm weather. Provisional figures put March as the third 
warmest since records began in 1910.

It was the sunniest month since 1929, 
with an average of 187 hours of sunshine over England and Wales. It was 
also the warmest since 1997.

The highest temperature recorded was 23.6c in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, on  March 27, which was a Scottish record for the month.

However, below normal rainfall for 
most of the UK has increased the risk that the drought in the South, 
East and Yorkshire could spread in the next few months.
