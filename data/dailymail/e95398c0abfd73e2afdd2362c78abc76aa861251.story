A disgraced carer who screamed 'I hate you' at a dementia patient at the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital is still working with elderly people.

Bonka Kostova roughly pulled the  helpless 73-year-old patient
into the ward with his trousers round his ankles before launching a 
tirade of abuse at him.   

Ms Kostova, a qualified midwife who was working as a healthcare assistant, was struck off this week by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. 

But an alarming loophole in the system 
means she can still be a carer, because healthcare assistants are not 
officially regulated.

A healthcare assistant who dragged a dementia patient half-naked from a toilet at the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital is still working with the elderly

During the incident in July 2010, the Bulgarian carer branded the patient 'an animal' and told startled 
colleagues she could not tolerate dementia sufferers.

She failed to turn up to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing this week, which banned her from ever working again in a qualified nursing or midwifery role.

But the NMC had no power to ban her from taking another job as a healthcare assistant.

In an email to the professional regulator, Kostova wrote: 'I don't want to practice as a midwife, I am quite happy to work as a carer only'.

Healthcare assistants are not regulated,
although there are plans afoot to change this in light of the public 
inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal.

NMC Chair Timothy Cole said: 'The panel was in no doubt that, on the facts found proved, Ms Kostova placed the patient at unwarranted risk of harm.

'She has brought the profession into disrepute and breached fundamental tenets of the profession.'  

It was revealed Kostova is now working St Joseph's Convent Nursing Home, a private establishment in Stafford which charges its elderly and disabled patients up to £676 a week.

The 41-resident home is owned by the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Cluny, based in Dublin.

It is thought she has now been suspended from St Joseph's in the light of the NMC case.

Kostova abused the patient while working at Stafford hospital on July 22, 2010.

Patient A, who suffered from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's, was found wandering the ward in a confused and agitated state at around 3.30am.

Ms Kostova's former colleague Jane Wilkinson (pictured) told a misconduct hearing this week that Kostova was 'out of control' when dealing with the patient

Kostova was asked to take over his one-to-one care, but was soon seen by staff nurse Jane Wilkinson pushing him forcibly back down into his wheelchair.   

'Ms Wilkinson took patient A to the toilet and then went to answer a call bell', said Rebecca Wood, for the NMC.

'When she returned she witnessed the registrant pulling patient A out of the toilet, pulling him by the collar of his pyjama top.

'His trousers were around his ankles, his genitals exposed.

'Due to the aggression shown and the fact Patient A had no dignity, staff nurse Wilkinson intervened at that point, pulling patient A's trousers up and assisted getting him back into the wheelchair.'  

Ms Wilkinson told the hearing Kostova then became 'out of control', shouting abuse at patient A as he was led away.

'She shouted: 'I hate him, I really hate him, he is like an animal, I can't bear working with him'', Ms Wilkinson told the hearing.  

'Bonnie repeated her comments two or three times. It seemed Bonnie was becoming hysterical.'

Kostova's case is the first to be brought before an NMC misconduct panel since the publication of a damning report into standards at Stafford Hospital.  

The two-year inquiry, led by Sir Robert Francis QC, found 'failures at every level', including patient left lying in their own urine for days, forced to drink water from vases and sent home with  life-threatening conditions.   

As many as 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily - though Sir Robert had said the true figure will probably never be known.  

Mr Cole said a finding of misconduct was inevitable given Kostova shunned the NMC hearing and has offered no insight into her actions.  

'The panel has no evidence of an explanation, remorse, a genuine apology, remediation or insight, or any assurance from Ms Kostova that such behaviour would not happen again', he said.  

'Therefore, the panel cannot be satisfied Mr Kostova is highly unlikely to repeat her misconduct.  

'The panel considers she would be in the future liable to place patients in unwarranted risk of harm.'  

Kostova was hired by the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust in April 2009 while she was waiting for her midwifery registration to take effect in the UK.

She was offered no training in handling aggressive dementia patients, and was allowed to continue working on the ward despite several incidents of abrupt behaviour towards patients and staff.

Workmates simply put her bad behaviour down to her poor grasp of the English language.

'Ms Kostova, while not practicing as a registered midwife, was at the time of the incident, registered as a midwife with the NMC', said Mr Cole.  

'This made her subject to the code, with regards to her care for patients.'
