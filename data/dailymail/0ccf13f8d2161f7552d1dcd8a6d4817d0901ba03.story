Cindy Crawford's 13-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber looks like an angel modeling a pair of wings on Instagram.

The image was taken by Kaia's older brother Presley, 15, and shared on the siblings' shared Instagram account earlier today. 

And despite her young age, fans were quick to comment how mature the teenage model appeared - with many of them suggesting that she could easily hold her own among some of Victoria's Secret's most experienced Angels.

'Better than a VS Angel,' one Instagram user commented, while another added: 'The soon to be Victoria's Secret Angel.' 

Kaia, who is the daughter of Cindy and her husband of 16 years Rande Gerber, made her fashion big fashion debut aged 10, when she appeared in the first ever Young Versace ad. 

The similarities in appearance between the youngster and her supermodel mother, now 48, quickly caught the attention of the industry's elite, many of whom were quick to label the youngster as one to watch for the future. 

At the time however, former Vogue cover star Cindy insisted her daughter would have to wait a while before throwing herself into a full-time fashion career. 

'At this point, she’s too young to pursue a career,' she told The Daily Front Row. 

'There aren’t even a handful of jobs for a 10-year-old girl. But if she’s 17 and wants to try it... of course, what can I say? She’s really into singing and acting. 

Model genes: While Kaia (R) has insisted she doesn't look anything like her mother (L), the similarities between the pair are incredibly obvious to most 

'She kind of jokingly said - I’m not even sure if it was jokingly - "I might model first because you don’t have to know how to do anything, but then I want to be a baby nurse."'

But it seems that Cindy has since changed her mind - and is now happily encouraging her daughter's burgeoning career as a professional model. 

Earlier this month, the teen made her magazine debut on the cover of Teen Vogue, a move which Cindy admits she was 100 per cent in favor of. 

'I’m happy for her to be happy,' she told the UK's Evening Standard. 'She’s kind of chomping at the bit and the Teen Vogue piece seemed like an appropriate thing to do.

'I am very comfortable with the photographer, who is a woman I’ve worked with a lot and is a mother herself.'
