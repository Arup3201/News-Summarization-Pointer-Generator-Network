A headmaster brought in to transform a failing school began an affair within weeks with a married secretary who worked there, an employment tribunal heard.

Mark Stenton had sex with mother-of-three Angela Honeywell at the school where her children were pupils, the hearing was told.

She left her husband Chris, a carpet fitter, and set up home with Mr Stenton, but ended the affair three months later to give her five-year marriage another go.

An enraged Mr Stenton went to her home
 where he kicked in her front door and was ordered to leave by police. 
He also sent a text threatening suicide to Mrs Honeywell's 14-year-old 
daughter Amy.

Education chiefs and school governors
 investigated and Mr Stenton was allowed to keep his £85,000-a-year job,
 despite protests from some parents.

But Mrs Honeywell left the school six 
months after the fling ended and launched legal action, claiming she was
 forced out of her admin post.

The school sex sessions were revealed at a pre-hearing review of the case in Bristol.

Angela, seen her home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire says people would joke about her and 'make snide comments'

Divorcee Mr Stenton, 42, was put in 
charge of Clarendon College in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, to pull it out of 
special measures.

But as he brought in new rules on discipline he was 
enjoying 'shared sexual encounters' on the school premises with 
41-year-old Mrs Honeywell.

Elizabeth Cunningham, for Mr Stenton 
and the school, told the hearing: 'This, from the beginning to the end, 
was a consensual sexual relationship and the documentation refers to 
shared sexual encounters taking place on school premises. This is 
accepted and happened around the first week in August 2011.'

Mrs Honeywell, who is still with her 
husband, told the tribunal she had lived in fear of the head and his 
'controlling nature' after their romance ended. She said: 'I was just so
 scared of being in contact with him in any way.

'People would joke about me and make 
snide comments. I had seen members of staff at Aldi glare and look at me
 as if I was a piece of dirt, and I was so ill after that I thought 
there was no way I could go back.'

Mrs Honeywell signed off sick from her job in November 2011, a month after ending her affair.

She claimed she was forced to give a 
£1,000 interview to a magazine because Mr Stenton had left her 
penniless.

She said: 'He'd taken every penny I had and it was the only 
way I could pay my mortgage. I was overdrawn for the first time in my 
life.

'What I had left I gave to my children, which I know isn't much 
consolation but they'd had a rough time. That is what I regret most.

'I was so ill I went down to six stone in weight. If I could turn back the clock I wouldn't do it again.'

Mrs Honeywell went back to her job in April last year but handed in her notice the following month.

She said she found her position untenable and 'had no understanding why I was being treated as an outcast by members of staff'.

She is claiming constructive unfair 
dismissal, wrongful dismissal and detriment against the Academy Trust of
 Clarendon Academy and Wiltshire Council.

Employment judge Christa Christensen 
dismissed an allegation of sexual harassment against Mr Stenton, ruling 
that the time period to lodge the claim had passed.

The full employment 
tribunal is likely to be held in March or April.

Mr Stenton, who has an 11-year-old 
daughter, is working as normal at the school which last October was 
praised as having 'outstanding leadership' by Ofsted inspectors.
