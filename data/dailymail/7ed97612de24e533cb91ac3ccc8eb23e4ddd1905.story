A Michigan woman who went missing while on a date was found dead last week near the home of a man she had met online.

Leigh Swanson, 45, was found dead with a gunshot wound, and had met her apparent killer Steven Fabi, on a dating site.

The Facebook page of her alleged killer, Steven Fabi, 30, depicts a person full of dark, ill-timed humor.

Foreboding: Fabi, who police believe killed Leigh Swanson, a woman he met online, posted this picture that said he is not alright

Double tragedy: Steven Michael Fabi, left, shot himself to death, and just 30 feet away from his house, deputies found the body of missing woman Leigh Swanson, right; the two had met for a date on November 16

Crime scene: Police say deputies coming to question Fabi heard a gunshot and were told a moment later by his father that the 30-year-old shot himself to death

He wrote: 'I'm a pretty retarded 
dude. I don't know what to say about myself. I'm a WICKED nice guy (to 
most people) and like to go out and have fun (sometimes a little too 
much - and I've got the bruises to prove it), then I wake up, laugh it 
off and do it all over again.

Victim: Leigh Swanson, 40, was discovered dead not far from the home of a man who had committed suicide just moments before police arrived to question him

'I love hanging out with my friends and doing what ever won't get us arrested (well, most of the time).'

Swanson's body
was found in Edenville Township but wasn’t immediately identified as 
Swanson, Midland County Sheriff Jerry Nielsen said during a news 
conference.

Two days after her November 16th date
with Fabi, Swanson called her mother around noon to say she was waiting
for her ride and would be home at around 3pm, Mlive.com reported.

But she never arrived at her home in Saginaw Township, and her family reported her missing November 20.

Relatives said Swanson’s Facebook page was taken down shortly after her disappearance.

Swanson’s mother, Beverly Kane, told WNEM-TV earlier that her daughter told her she had a bad feeling about going on the date.

‘I said, “Don’t go,”’ Kane told the television station.

‘But when she got there,’ the mother added, ‘she called me … and said everything was OK.’

Investigators traced the call to a house in Edenville Township, and two deputies went there Tuesday seeking information on the missing woman, Nielsen said.

Disturbing: Fabi's profile is full of black humor

Official version: Midland County Sheriff Jerry Nielsen speaks at a news conference about the disappearance of Leigh Swanson

Date gone awry: Swanson was reported missing November 20, about four days after going on a date with a man she had met online 

As they were walking to the front door of the house in the 5100 block of North Fox Road, they heard a gunshot.

Nielsen said the deputies took shelter and called to anyone in the house to come out with their hands over their heads.

A man emerged holding a cell phone on which he was speaking to 911 operators and said, ‘My son just shot himself,’ Nielsen said.

In the house, deputies found a man, identified by the sheriff’s department as 30-year-old Steven Michael Fabi, dead from a gunshot wound.

They also found human blood in another part of the house, he said.

Investigators began searching the area and found a woman’s body about 1.30pm Wednesday in a wooded area of a neighbor’s property about 30 feet from the road, the sheriff said.
