For her 30th birthday party, Sylvia Murray wore a big white dress that her guests thought looked uncannily like a wedding gown. And that's because it was one.

Miss Murray and her boyfriend Iain Dewar, 37, tricked 150 friends and family members into thinking they were attending her milestone birthday at Falkirk Football Stadium, when they were actually attending an even bigger milestone: their wedding. Surprise!

Iain Dewar, 37, and Sylvia Murray, 30, spent nine months planning their secret wedding, and invited 150 guests to her fake birthday party before surprising them all

The couple spent nine months planning their September wedding, but none of their 150 guests - not even their parents - knew a thing about it.

They tied the knot at Falkirk Football Stadium after 'incredible' amounts of fibbing, secret email accounts and undercover trips to bridal gown stores.

Sylvia's sister, Joanne, 27, was the only person who was let in on the secret, and Iain's best man was only told about it a month before the big day.

Sylvia even tricked her mother into approving the wedding dress by showing her a picture and telling her it was for a friend.

SYLVIA MURRAY AND IAIN DEWAR SPENT NINE MONTHS PLANNING THEIR WEDDING, BUT TRICKED ALL THEIR GUESTS INTO Sylvia and Iain tied the knot at Falkirk Football Stadium after 'incredible' amounts of fibbing, secret email accounts and undercover trips to bridal gown stores

But the covert operation proved well worth it, with Sylvia and Iain enjoying the 'best night of their lives' surrounded by stunned family and friends.

Sylvia, a social care worker, said: 
'It was a lot of work, and quite funny sometimes with everyone thinking 
they were going to a birthday party that was actually our wedding.

'I had to tell a few fibs, but can't believe we pulled it off. It all just came together and it was fantastic.'

Sylvia and Iain have been together for over nine years, and have two children, Sam, seven, and Amelia, three.

They
had always wanted to get married, but work and bringing up the children
kept pushing the wedding back.

But in January this year Sylvia hatched 
her 'secret wedding' plan.

The moment when Sylvia's mother Lynn first realised her daughter was getting married and saw her in her wedding dress

She
said: 'I was at home and At Last by Etta James came on, and I started 
to think about it.

'I called Iain, who was working in India as a mechanic, 
and I told him what I was thinking. He thought it was a great idea.'

'I did want my mum to give her 
approval on my dress, so I showed her a picture and told her it was my friend's. She liked it.'

With Iain overseas, Sylvia told sister Joanne, her bridesmaid.

Sylvia said: 'She thought I was 
crazy. She said I'd never pull it off.

'We were the only ones who knew, 
even Iain's brother Martin, the best man, didn't know until a month 
before.'

The secret became even harder to keep when Sylvia's mum, Lynn Burgess, made a surprise trip to Falkirk, from her home in Cyprus.

She said: 'My mum now lives in Cyprus
and she came home two weeks before the party as a surprise. She was 
staying at our house in Falkirk, so I had to hide the paperwork and have
a secret e-mail account.

Sylvia and Iain sign their wedding register alongside their two children, Sam and Amelia, and their family

'I was on my iPad organising this 
wedding and she was knitting and didn't know a thing.

'I had to lie to 
Iain's mum who was my babysitter, telling her I was working when I was 
really going for a wedding dress fitting.

'I did want my mum to give her 
approval on my dress, so I showed her a picture and told her it was my friend's wedding dress. She liked it.'

Invitations for Sylvia's '30th' on 
Saturday, 22 September went out with instructions to 'dress glam' and 
arrive on time at seven pm. Unknown to the guests, the ceremony was at 8
pm.

Sylvia Murray and Iain Dewar have been together for nine years and have two schildren, Sam, seven, and three-year-old Amelia

Sylvia said: 'If people were late, they would miss the ceremony. On the night, the guests were waiting in a separate room from the one we were marrying in. Even the staff at the stadium didnâ€™t know until the last minute.

'If people were late, they would miss 
the ceremony. Even the staff at the football stadium didn't know until the last minute.'

'When Joanne and I were dressed, my parents came in, and the look on their faces when they saw me in a wedding dress was fantastic. My dad walked me down the aisle and everyone's face was a picture.'

'We wanted to get married, and I'd do it just like this again in a minute. I didn't want to get involved with picking starters and table plans, I just wanted our family and friends there and to have a great night.'

Their wedding photographer, Paul Borg Grech, said: 'This was a first for me in 24 years. The atmosphere was electric, and it was very emotional. The couple were so much in love and everyone there was so happy for them.'
