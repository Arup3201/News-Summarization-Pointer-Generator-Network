A kindhearted group of friends showed solidarity for their sick buddy on Saturday by all wearing surgical masks to their high school prom.

Jared Hill, 18, of Woodbridge, Virginia, was diagnosed with testicular cancer last September and has been undergoing chemotherapy since to help combat the illness.

Despite his illness, Jared desperately wanted to attend his girlfriend Emily Jarrell's senior prom at Osbourn Park High School on Saturday night.

Chemotherapy is vitally important to helping Jared combat cancer, but the treatment has also compromised his immune system and made him more susceptible to sickness.

His doctor told him that if he really wanted to go to the prom he would have to wear a mask to protect himself from catching other people's germs.

‘I just had to wear a mask at all times and make sure I didn't really make contact with too many other people,’ Jared told FOX5.

To show support for Jared, Emily and a group of their friends decided that they too would wear masks on the night to show their support.

‘We want him to feel uncomfortable or 
alone, and we didn't want people to make fun of him or think he was 
weird for wearing a mask so we all wore them to prom,’ said Simone 
Beaty, who helped Emily make it happen.

'We didn't know it would have such a big impact on people,' she said.

On Saturday night, 17 people wore protective masks to the prom and Jared, who is a senior at Hylton High School, was extremely appreciative of the support.

'Since there was so many of us, it made me feel not so alone,' Jared said. 'It helped a lot.'

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in American males between the ages of 15 and 34.

Jared said he hopes to bring additional 
awareness about testicular cancer, something he admits has been difficult for him to talk about with his peers.

'It makes 
me feel real happy to have such great friends,' he said. 'For them to do
 something as big as that for me, that showed a lot of character.'

Jared has now completed his course of chemo and is doing a lot better, but he is not yet cancer-free.
