The family of a 4-year-old girl who nearly drowned in a lake is searching for the heroic one-armed woman who saved her.

Caylee Brumlow was celebrating her fourth birthday with family at a beach on Allatoona Lake outside Atlanta, Ga., Saturday when her parents realized she was missing, WXIA-TV reported.

'As soon as we didn't see her, neither one of us wanted to admit it, but we thought the worst right then and there. We thought that she had went under,' said Caylee's father, Corey Brumlow.

Danger: After a minute missing, Caylee Brumlow's family saw her being held above water by a one-armed woman in Allatoona Lake, pictured

After a minute of complete panic, Caylee's older brother spotted her being held above water by a one-armed woman in the six-foot deep lake at Red Top Mountain. Brumlow jumped in the lake.

'I swam out and got her and told the lady that was my daughter,' Brumlow told WSB-TV.

After pulling her daughter to shore, Brumlow said Caylee vomited water. When Caylee began to breath again, the one-armed woman walked up to him.

'As soon as she walked up, she put her arm around my neck and we hugged and kind of shared a thank you-type embrace and I never saw her again,' Brumlow told WXIA-TV.

Caylee was taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital and transferred to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta-Scottish Rite. She was released after only a few hours.

Relieved: Michelle and Corey Brumlow are hoping the woman who saved their daughter will contact them online. Corey, right, said he wasn't able to properly thank the stranger

Brumlow said he never got to properly thank the stranger who saved his daughter. He's hoping she'll see see Caylee's story online and reach out to him.

'I would like to thank her and tell her how much I love her for what she's done,' he said. 'She let my baby girl see 4-years-old.'

Caylee's birthday was Sunday, the day after she was saved by the stranger.

'I hope and pray to God that we find her, but if we can’t, that’s more a sign to me that [she] was my daughter’s guardian angel,' Brumlow told WSB-TV.

Brumlow asked for the woman to contact him through his Facebook page.
