The records of Captain Edward Smith, who was chosen to skipper the Titanic that sunk in April 1912, have been published online 

The records of the doomed Titanic captain and his crew are among details of more than a million seamen which have been published online. 

Captain Edward Smith was chosen to captain the Titanic, which had been labelled practically unsinkable, on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.

Plenty has been written about his role on the voyage, with historians in disagreement over his final moments on the ship.

Now, people will have the chance to explore his career as a captain at sea before the sinking of the Titanic in the Atlantic in the early hours of April 15 1912, where he died along with more than 1,500 people. 

Born in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent in 1850, Captain Smith joined the White Star Shipping Line in 1880 and served aboard the company's freight liners around the world.

In 1901, he was captain of the SS Majestic when he and his crew transported troops to Cape Colony during the Boer War for which he was awarded a special Transport Medal.

However, there were warning signs of what was to come later when the white-whiskered skipper was captaining the RMS Olympic when she collided with British warship HMS Hawke in 1911.

Following the collision, the ship's propeller was badly damaged and the vessel had to be returned to port.

Despite the collision, Captain Smith was chosen to captain the Titanic on her voyage from Southampton to New York City.

Historians dispute his final moments before the ship sunk.

Born in Hanley, in the Potteries on January 27 1850. He attended Etruria British School in Stoke-on-Trent. 

After school Smith worked for about three years at the Etruria Forge where he operated a steam hammer. 

In 1867 he went to Liverpool to go to sea and followed in the footsteps of his half-brother Joseph Hancock, a captain on a sailing ship.

At the age of 25 he passed his master's certificate of competency which meant he could command a vessel.

In 1887 he married Sarah Eleanor Pennington, a farmer's daughter.

In 1898, his only child Helen Melville Smith was born

Died on April 15 1912. Witnesses reported he dived into the sea as the bridge of the ship went under.

What is known is that Captain Smith was awoken about 20 minutes before midnight on April 14 after the ship hit an iceberg.

Some historians have said that Smith panicked, isolating himself on the bridge or locking himself away in his quarters while the crisis unfolded around him.

He has also been criticised for allowing lifeboats to leave the ship only partially filled.

But there are also tales of his behaviour during the evacuation which cast him in a more favourable light.

Aside from tales of helping children into lifeboats, it is believed he was last seen in the bridge area having given the final order to abandon ship, before he died at the helm.

He appears to have made no attempt to save himself.

As well as Captain Smith's records, the details of all seamen from first officers to stockers are recorded in the Liverpool Crew Lists 1861-1919 collection.

The Titanic was designed in Liverpool but the city never enjoyed the sight of it steaming up the Mersey.

About 90 members of the crew came from the city, including the two lookouts who spotted the iceberg. 

The Titanic sunk in the Atlantic in the early hours of April 15 1912, which killed more than 1,500 people

It details the names of every crew member who worked on vessels registered to the Port of Liverpool, which was once one of the biggest ports in the world. 

In total, it records 912 ships with each crew member's name, age, birthplace, residence and past maritime experience, and even remarks on their general behaviour.

There are also details on each list saying whether crew members were discharged, deserted or died at sea.

The crew of the RMS Scotia, a famous mid-Victorian passenger liner which won the Blue Riband for breaking the record for the fastest Atlantic crossing in 1863, is also in the collection.   

Miriam Silverman, Senior UK Content Manager from Ancestry which has published the records online, said: 'From ship captains to their crew, this collection sheds light on a period in which the port of Liverpool was a global transport hub.

'With more than a million maritime records now available online at Ancestry it will also be of huge significance for anybody looking to trace their seafaring ancestors back to Liverpool at this time.'
