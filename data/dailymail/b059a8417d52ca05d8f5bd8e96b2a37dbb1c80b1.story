Online shopping is considered quicker and more convenient that trekking round the High Street, but getting it wrong leaves 86 per cent of people in a state of grief that can take months to pass, according to new research.

While online shoppers accept that they can't feel fabrics and that colours may vary from expectations if a new piece of clothing doesn't fit it can send shoppers in to a spiral of grief that very closely resembles the stages of mourning .. and it's women who are the hardest hit.

According to a survey of 1,000 shoppers, making a mess of online clothing shopping leaves people experiencing up to five stages of emotions similar to those of the famous Kübler-Ross model which, in the world of psychology, describes the ‘five stages of grief’.

If online shopping goes wrong and things don't fit we experience emotions similar to the key stages of grief

Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance are considered the five key emotions when mourning a death, and while some shoppers, mostly men, will move swiftly in to anger and then acceptance, others can take months to work through each stage.

Women, often blaming themselves rather than the retailer, tend to spend a long time in Denial before eventually moving on to Bargaining behaviour, such as seeking further opinions or trying various accessories to improve the look.

Men are much more likely to enter at the Anger phase, openly expressing frustration with the retailer or the situation.

At least trekking round High Street fitting rooms means that shoppers are pleased with the end result

Retail psychology expert Phillip Adcock, who consulted on the project, said: “Unlike buying something like an iPod, buying clothing is intensely subjective.  Do I love it?  Does it make me look fabulous? People expect the fit to be right and they definitely tend to blame themselves for clothes not fitting properly.

'Spotting the symptoms is often easy.  If you can relate to feelings of ‘disbelief’, ‘puzzlement’, ‘frustration’ or ‘anger’, then you have probably gone through the phases of Denial, Bargaining and Anger, for example.'

The survey for virtual fitting room provider Fits.me asked shoppers what feelings or actions follow the purchase of an item of clothing that doesn’t fit.  Ninety per cent of all respondents admitted to keeping clothes that don’t fit them, rather than returning them to the store.

57% of people felt Anger at themselves for purchasing an item of clothing that didn’t fit, while 21% direct their Anger at the retailer for not meeting their expectations.

67% of women experienced Denial, compared to just 50% of men and half of all women (49%) said they will try on an item more than once in an effort to make it fit, while 38% hold on to it while they try to lose weight.

There are also significant differences in the way different age groups manage this shopper's grief: 25 per cent of 18-34 year olds do everything they can to squeeze in to the garment, while only 9 per cent of over 55s do the same. 60 per cent of people cling on to items for more than a month.

The survey also revealed that a typical shopper has five items of clothing hanging in their wardrobe that don’t fit them, costing an average of £110 – leaving wardrobes bulging and pockets empty.

A spokesman for Fits.me, said: 'It’s pretty disappointing to open a delivery and find it doesn’t fit – now we learn the disappointment runs deeper and lasts longer than we knew.

The good news for online shoppers is that retailers are getting more sophisticated in their efforts to avoid disappointing their customers.  They are using technology like virtual fitting rooms to avoid fit mistakes – and this sort of research could help them to react better to customer disappointment that might still occur.

'“For example, if a retailer knows that you’ve been disappointed and are probably experiencing grief, it might contact you in the tone of a close friend who sympathises, while they fix the issue and turn a negative experience into something positive after all.'
