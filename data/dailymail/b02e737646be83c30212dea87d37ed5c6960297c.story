These pictures show the moments a corner shop worker was attacked with a machete as he tried to defend himself against a gang of armed robbers.

Mubasher Khan, 22, suffered serious lacerations to his hand as he raised his hands to protect himself as one of the robbers aimed the machete at his head.

One of Mr Khan's fingers was almost severed and has had to be stitched back on. He remains in hospital.

The attack happened at the S and P convenience store in Chadderton in Oldham, Greater Manchester, on April 20

The shop, S&P Stores, in Chadderton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester about to shut at the time and the gang were only able to steal £150 from the till, which was the overnight float, before they ran off.

Greater Manchester Police have issued CCTV of Saturday night's raid in which the robbers can be seen attacking the shopkeepers in an 'out of control' incident.

One of the gang immediately jumped over the counter to confront a worker, while another brandished a knife at him as he tried to get the till open.

Just seconds later they began wildly swinging the weapons at the two members of staff, striking them several times before they grabbed just £150 from the till and fled the scene.

Speaking from the shop, Rajan Patel, 24, whose family own the business, who suffered cuts to his arm and back and had his necklace torn off said the incident had been 'utterly terrifying'.

Mr Patel said: 'The incident was a complete shock. Nothing like this has happened in 10 years of my family running the shop.

At about 9.35pm on Saturday three masked men burst into the shop, one armed with a hunting knife and another had a machete

During the altercation, the sword was swung towards a 22-year-old man, who raised his hands to defend himself, only for one of his fingers to be badly cut

After stealing some cash, the offenders ran off. They are described as being white men in their late teens to early 20s, in dark clothing

'When they burst in I thought it was a joke but quickly I realised it was very serious. One of the gang threatened me with a knife so before I opened the till I pressed the panic button.

'Another of the gang jumped over the counter and must have seen me do it because he suddenly became very aggressive.

'Mubasher was in the store room and came through when he heard all of the noise and when he did the man who had jumped over the counter started to attack him with the sword.

The man with the machete was wearing a dark Adidas T-shirt with a motif on the front

'He was trying to hit him in the head and Mubasher put his hands up to protect himself. He had terrible injuries to his hands. I thought he would have lost all of his fingers on his right hand - that's how bad it looked.'

Mr Patel said that he was slashed by one of the gang after fumbling with the touch-screen till and not being able to get the money out quick enough.

He said: 'I'm not bothered about the money. It was just the float, so between £150 and £200. But the violence that was used for such a small amount of money was horrifying.

'Who knows how bad our injuries could have been. I think they were trying to kill us. Mubasher is still in hospital but he could have been very badly hurt.'

They are described as being white men in their late teens to early 20s, in dark clothing. The man with the Samurai sword was wearing a dark Adidas T-shirt with a motif on the front.

Mr Patel's Rudrashka necklace, which is important in his Hindu religion, was stolen in the incident. It is worth around £800. The incident happened at around 9.30pm on Saturday night.

Detective Constable Richard Whiting said: 'This was a violent and reckless robbery carried out by three young men who were out of control.

'The injury that one of the men suffered to his finger was horrific, yet it is fortunate that nobody was more seriously hurt, such was the threat that came with these dangerous weapons.

'I would appeal to anyone who may have seen the offenders entering or leaving the shop to call us, and we also ask that anyone who may have information about this offence to call us.

'Robberies of this nature are rare and we are determined to catch the people responsible.'
