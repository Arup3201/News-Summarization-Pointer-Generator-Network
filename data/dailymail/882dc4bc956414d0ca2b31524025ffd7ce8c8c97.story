A Ferrari that made world headlines after being infamously written off by an FBI agent has sold for more than $370,000 (£230,000).

The once-pristine F50 was stolen from a dealer in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, in 2003 and only discovered five years later.

But the owner's relief turned to rage when one of the federal officers looking after the vehicle took it for a spin and smashed it into a hedge before its return.

Oops! The Ferrari F50 was crashed into a hedge by an FBI agent in 2008 while he was looking after the vehicle during a probe into its theft five years earlier

Written off: The crash tore a huge hole in the left-hand side of the supercar. The damage came to a eye-watering $750,000

Its chequered history didn't deter buyers, however, as a bidding frenzy erupted on US salvage website Copart.

The auction site was managing the sale for an insurance company following a complicated legal dispute with the US Justice Department.

It eventually sold for $370,000 (£233,000) after costs - with the buyer now expected to spend a further fortune painstakingly restoring it to its former glory.

The 1995 model's complicated history began in
2003 when pilot and criminal Tom Baker entered a Philadelphia Ferrari 
showroom requesting a test-drive.

On the mend: The new owner who bought the car for $370,00 is now expected to spend another vast sum to get it fully restored

The 1995 model of the Ferrari F50 is one of just 349 ever built and was the fastest car to ever come out of the Italian company's factory when it was launched.

With a 4.7-litre V12 engine developing 513bhp, it could accelerate from 0-60mph in 3.7 seconds - when in full working order (like this one above).

It could reach a top speed of 202mph.

Famous owners include Rod Stewart.

During the test, the salesman got out of the Ferrari - giving Baker the opportunity to accelerate away in the Italian car.

It was thought the Ferrari, being one of just 50 in the USA, would be shipped off to another country and into the hands of a wealthy motorist's collection.

So the insurance company paid out on the vehicle - only for Baker to have stored it in an aircraft hangar alongside two other stolen Ferraris in Kentucky.

He sold the supercar in 2008 to a Kentucky doctor for $375,000 (£250,000) plus another Ferrari convertible.

When the unsuspecting buyer went to register his ownership with Ferrari in Italy, he was shocked to find it was the now legendary stolen F50.

He called the cops and the FBI arrived the next day to take car away.

However, while transporting the Ferrari from one warehouse to another, Agent Fred Kingston lost control and crashed it in Lexington, Kentucky.

The insurance company, which had paid out £400,000 when it was stolen, demanded the Department of Justice pay ($750,000) £475,000 for the vehicle.

But they refused, claiming the accident occurred 'while the Ferrari was being detained by the FBI' and said the bureau was granted immunity due to a controversial federal law.

Baker pleaded guilty to grand theft auto and was jailed for two years.
