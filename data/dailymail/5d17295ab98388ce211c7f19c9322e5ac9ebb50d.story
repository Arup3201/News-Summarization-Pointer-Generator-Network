Ronald Koeman has heard all the predictions of doom and gloom for Southampton, that having sold their star assets and rushed to fill a patchy squad, they will face a season-long relegation battle.

Not only that, the Dutchman, 51, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino at St Mary's this summer after the Argentinean jumped ship to Tottenham, faces a baptism of fire today as the Saints open their campaign at Anfield.

The fixture emphasises a dramatic restructuring at Southampton. Liverpool have signed two Saints players so outstanding in 2013-14 they earned England World Cup call-ups, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, as well as Dejan Lovren, the commanding centre-half who scored Saints' winner at Liverpool last season.

 Saints have also lost England left-back, Luke Shaw, to Manchester United, and fellow home-grown full-back Calum Chambers to Arsenal.

But Koeman has overseen a rapid rebuilding he claims leaves Saints in good shape to repeat the 8th-placed finished they achieved under Pochettino. And he scoffs at relegation fears, saying: 'We are much better than some people think.

'I cannot do anything about that [other people's estimations]. If you'd like put some money on us to go down, I think you will lose it!

'What I've seen in the pre-season is that we are a much better team than other teams in the Premier League.'

Looking up: Ronald Koeman is confident he will have a good season at Southampton 

Saints have netted £97m from their five major sales and Koeman has brought in seven new faces at an initial cost of around £48m. That leaves almost £50m profit, some of which will clear debt racked up under the regime of former chairman Nicola Cortese and some of which may be spent on more new faces.

Irish striker Shane Long, 27, at £12m from Hull has been the biggest purchase, followed by Serbian midfielder Dusan Tadic (£10.9m from Twente), England goalkeeper Fraser Forster (£10m, from Celtic), Italian striker Graziano Pelle (£9m, Feyenoord) and Hungarian defender Florin Gardos (£6m, Steaua Bucharest). Left-back Ryan Bertrand from Chelsea and Algerian midfielder Saphir Tadir from Inter Milan have arrived on loan with purchase options next summer.

Southampton's executive hierarchy are comfortable they are not in a tailspin and share Koeman's optimism, privately stressing the summer's trading is nowhere near as negative for them or as positive for other clubs as had been painted.

New signing: Koeman signed Shane Long from Hull this week

'Of course in an ideal world you'd keep all your best players, Lallana and Shaw among them,' said one source. 'But you won't be seeing either of them for a few weeks because they're out injured or unfit.

'And nobody would begrudge Rickie's move but it was clear last season his legs meant he wouldn't be playing as key a role even here this season. Let's just say the buying clubs didn't under-pay.'

Koeman admits Saints themselves may have overpaid for Long but says most players moving to English clubs are costing over the odds. 'It's not a [special] case of Shane Long,' he says. 'In general you pay too much money for players, especially in England.'

Koeman laughs when asked if he is in a win-win situation where he will win plaudits for a repeat of last season's top-10 finish but be exonerated of blame if Saints flop because of the huge turnaround in players.

'If we are ninth, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, even 16th? … then we're doing a great job,' he smiles. 'It's an easy season for me as manager!'

He doesn't mean it. He has his own specific targets, and they evidently include a respectable position in the top half or close while also continuing Saints' work of developing bright young talent.

'A successful season is if the team play in my way of playing, if the young players will develop and if we bring some good English players to the national team,' he says.

'And If we are in a position around eighth in the league. Maybe seventh, maybe eighth, maybe eleventh. There's not a specific position on the list.

'The most important thing is the players and team play under my philosophy … If they show me that, then I'm happy with the performance of the team.'

Hurdles ahead include handling a disgruntled goalkeeper in Artur Boruc, displaced by Forster, and weighing up whether Morgan Schneiderlin, who threw a tantrum when not allowed to move cheaply to Tottenham, can play a pivotal role. Koeman says yes.

He is as much optimist as pragmatist. Asked for Anfield memories he cites a 2-0 Champions League win as Benfica manager there in March 2006. Only later does he add he also lost there, twice, as boss of PSV.

'I prefer talking about winning!' he says. Looking on the bright side will be a valuable quality.
