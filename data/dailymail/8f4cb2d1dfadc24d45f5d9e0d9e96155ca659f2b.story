A five-month-old boy died in the scorching heat of a minivan after his mother forgot to drop him off at a daycare center.

Stephanie Gray made the heartbreaking discovery after she went to pick up her son and was told by staff that he had never been dropped off.

Joel Gray, who was five months old, was left in his rear-facing car-seat in the family minivan for around six hours on Tuesday as temperatures reached 93 degrees.

Investigation: The minivan where mother-of-four Stephanie Gray discovered she had left her baby son Joel for six hours in 93-degree heat

The family and friends of Stephanie, 38, and her husband Aaron have rallied around the devastated couple following the tragic accident in Nashville, Tennessee.

Police were investigating the death of the five-month-old baby who was found by his mother in the family van outside a church in Donelson.

Officer were called about 3 pm and found the child's body inside a vehicle at Donelson Heights United Methodist Church.

Police believe that Mrs Gray left her home shortly before 8am to drop off two of her four children, aged six and nine, at school, the Stanford Montessori Design Center.

It is then believed that the mother 
returned home to pick up her 11-year-old son and baby and drove less 
than a mile to drop her eldest at Two Rivers Middle School.

Distress: The five-month-old boy had only been enrolled in the church day care center the day before he died

She then intended to leave her youngest at the church day care center where he had started the day before.

Tragically, she returned home and didn't return to her car until 2.30pm when it was time to collect Joel, according to authorities.

According to a statement from Metro Nashville Police: 'Gray reported she was home all day, her minivan parked in the driveway, 
until she returned to the church at 2:30 p.m. to pick Joel up.

'When she
was told the child had not been there all day, she immediately ran to 
her minivan and found Joel in his rear car seat inside the vehicle. The
child was taken inside the church. At that point, it is believed he 
was deceased from the heat inside the van.'

Mrs Gray was taken to a local hospital for treatment. A police spokeswoman described Mrs Gray and her husband as 'extremely distraught'. She has not been charged but the investigation continues.

The mother-of-four is an attorney who looks after military veterans' cases and often works from home. Her husband works in IT for local government.

Local councilman Steve Glover told The Tennessean: 'Everyone is just in total shock. I can’t even imagine the tragedy they’re feeling right now.'
