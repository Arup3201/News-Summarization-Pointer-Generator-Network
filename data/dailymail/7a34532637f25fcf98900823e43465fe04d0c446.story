A three-year-old who was killed in a hit-and-run collision was walking home with his mother after a trip to town to pick up a catalogue so he could choose his Christmas presents, police said today.

Danny Wake died after he wandered into the road in Darlington at 10.35am on Monday morning and Durham Police were sure the driver of the vehicle would have known he hit the boy.

Detectives today released CCTV images of Danny walking with his family moments before he was fatally injured.

In the images, 
Danny is shown trailing behind his mother who is wheeling a pushchair 
with a girl closer behind.

The little boy, in a hat and thick green coat, is shown walking happily in the sunshine moments before the tragedy.

They also issued images of passengers getting off a nearby bus, hoping to trace additional witnesses to the crash.

At a news conference at Durham Police’s Aykley Heads headquarters, Chief Inspector Ed Turner offered his condolences to Danny’s family, adding: 'I cannot imagine what they have been going through since the tragic events earlier this week.

'On Monday morning three-year-old Danny, along with his mum, brother Georgie and another child had been making their way from Darlington town centre where they had been to collect an Argos catalogue so that Danny could take it home and choose his Christmas presents.'

Chief Insp Turner said the group was walking onto Falmer Road from Neasham Road when Danny strayed into the road.

The driver of the unknown vehicle did not stop, and Danny was killed.

A 24-year-old driver was arrested on 
Monday and was released last night, with police now saying they do not 
believe he had any connection to Danny’s death.

Mr Turner said: 'Today I would like to directly appeal to the close-knit community of Darlington to help us find out who was driving the vehicle that hit Danny.

'Were you driving that vehicle or do you know who was?'

The traffic officer asked anyone who was in the area on Monday morning to come forward.

He added: 'Do you know someone who has been acting strangely since the incident or who has a recently-damaged vehicle, however slight?

'I firmly believe that someone will have some information that will help us, I would ask you to take a minute and put your loyalties to one side and imagine what Danny’s family are going through and contact us if you know anything.   

Investigation: A CCTV image taken from a passing bus shows Danny Wake walking on the pavement moments before he was killed. Police have appealed for passengers getting off the bus to come forward with information

Christmas shopping: Danny, who is seen with his back to the bus camera, had been returning home from a trip to the shops to pick up a catalogue to choose Christmas presents when the tragic incident happened

'I would like to make it clear that we believe it is most likely that the person who hit Danny did it entirely accidentally, and realising what they had done, panicked and drove away.

'I want to appeal directly to this person to come forward and tell us what happened.'

Officers are studying hundreds of hours of CCTV footage in a bid to identify the vehicle.

Chief Insp Turner said of the passengers seen on CCTV getting off the 13G bus to contact police.

He said: 'They may have important information that can assist our inquiries.'

Investigation: A local man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after the crash but police now believe he is unconnected with the incident

'A family have lost their three-year-old little boy in the most tragic of circumstances and they need to know why this has happened, please help us to find the answers they need.'

Danny’s family issued a statement yesterday paying tribute to the youngster.

They said: 'Danny was a beautiful, loving and caring little boy, always laughing with a cheeky little smile.

'He had lots of friends and was adored by his little brother Georgie. We just can’t find words to describe how much our very special boy will be missed by all of the family.'
