Celebrity chefs such as Heston Blumenthal have been blamed for a surge in deadly chip pan fines.

The London Fire Brigade today revealed fires from deep-frying pans increased 14 per cent between 2012 and 2013, and suggested a new trend for authentic 'posh' chips could be behind it.

Techniques such as the triple-cooking favoured by Mr Blumenthal are especially dangerous, the brigade suggested, and could have contributed to the hundreds of injuries caused by chip pan fires in recent years.

Trend-setter: London Fire Brigade warned that a vogue for 'posh' chips could be putting people in danger

Technique: Mr Blumenthal recommends deep-frying chips twice - which fire experts say heightens the risk

Concentration: A fire brigade spokesman said even a moment's lapse when using deep-fryers can end in disaster

The chef's technique involves boiling the raw potatoes, and cooling them in the freezer before two rounds of deep-frying, to achieve the crispiest texture possible.

Firefighter Dave Brown said: 'Many people think that chip pans are a thing of the past, but there's been a recent rise in celebrity chefs endorsing posh chips on TV cooking programmes.

'Chip pans and cooking with hot oil can be really dangerous and the risk increases when you start frying food more than once, as is the current trend with chips.

'All it can take is for you to become distracted for a few seconds and your cooking oil can quickly go up in flames.'

Deadly: Chip pan fires, pictured here in fire brigade controlled demonstrations, have killed three people and injured 500 in London in the past five years

Over the past five years, there were 1,754 chip pan fires in London resulting in 500 people being injured and three people being killed.

However, the fire brigade stressed that overall fires were down by a quarter.

They suggested that people visit their local chip shop, or use the oven, rather than attempting to imitate chefs such as Mr Blumenthal.

Firefighters also warned that, if a chip pan does catch fire, it is best not move it, and not try to extinguish it with water - as it will create a huge fireball. Instead, people should call the fire brigade.

Representatives for Mr Blumenthal were not available for comment.

Perfection: The triple-cooking recipe is said to produce the ultimate chips

To serve four people

Ingredients:1.2 kg potatoes1 litre groundnut oil1 litre rendered fat (dripping, goose or duck)

Method

Wash the potatoes and with a sharp kitchen knife square them into rectangles, then cut them into chips about 1 cm thick.

As soon as they are cut, put them into a bowl under cold running water for 10 minutes or so to rinse off some of the starch, then drain them.

Next, bring a casserole of unsalted water to the boil and plunge in the drained potatoes. Bring back to the boil and simmer gently until the point of a knife will penetrate the chips easily.

It is important to make sure the water is only just simmering. If it boils too aggressively the potatoes will begin to break up.

Very carefully lift the potatoes out of the water, usingÂ  a slotted spoon, and place them on a tray. Allow them to steam cool, then place in the fridge. The chips will harden when cold.

For next stage, heat groundnut oil to a temperature of 130C and plunge in the chips. After a while. they will take on a drier appearance (do not let them brown at all).

Drain them, let them cool to room temperature, and put them in the fridge. When cold, they are ready for their final cooking.

Heat the rendered fat to 180C. Plunge in chips and cook until golden brown. This may take 8-10 minutes; be patient in order to obtain a really crisp chip. Drain and season with salt only; they will take quite a lot.
