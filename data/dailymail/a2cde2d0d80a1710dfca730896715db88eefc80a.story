Ever wondered who would rush to Santa’s aid if he had to crash-land his sleigh?

Or perhaps you’ve pondered your local council’s state of readiness for a zombie invasion?

If not, don’t worry. Someone, somewhere is asking these crucial questions.

Ridiculous request: Cheltenham Council was asked to reveal who would be responsible for rescuing Santa if he crash-landed during his rounds

They were two of the more bizarre queries put to local authorities under Freedom of Information laws this year.

Others centred on what measures might be being put in place to defend against Napoleon’s army, how many drawing pins a town hall uses and how much taxpayers’ money was paid to exorcists.

The Local Government  Association unveiled its top ten list of bizarre FOI questions of 2011 to highlight the huge cost to taxpayers of frivolous requests.

At the top was this request to West Devon Council: How does the council plan to help the brave soldiers of our infantry if and when Napoleon and his marauding hordes invade the district?

The French emperor died in 1821, six years after his defeat at Waterloo.

Zombie nation: Both Bristol and Leicester councils were asked what they would do in the event of an invasion by the undead

Cheltenham Council was asked to provide details of its contingency plans for a crash landing by Santa.

The applicant called for details about who at the council would rescue Santa, who would be responsible for rounding up the reindeer and which staff would get the job of clearing the crash site.

Both Bristol Council and Leicester Council were quizzed about their readiness for a zombie invasion, while Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service was asked about plans for an alien attack.

The Freedom of Information Act gives people the right to ask any public body for information they have on any subject they choose. Unless there’s a good reason, the organisation must provide the information within 20 working days.

Nonsense: Another wasteful question probed one council on how they would counter an attack by the long-deceased Napoleon and his 19th century army

Peter Fleming, chairman of the LGA’s improvement board, said: ‘Across the country, hundreds of Freedom of Information requests are sent to local authorities every day.

‘However, as this list shows, some of the requests do not appear to relate very closely to the services councils are focused on delivering.’

More than 197,000 requests for information were made to councils this year.

The local authorities spent £31.6million responding. Hampshire Council was asked how many drawing pins there were in its town hall, and what percentage were stuck in a pin board.

Overly superstitious: One local authority was quizzed on how much it paid to exorcists (posed by actors)

Scarborough Council was asked how many cheques were issued by the council and how many it received.

The number of privacy walls between toilets was the hot topic for a Cornwall Council taxpayer.

A request to Wealden Council asked: How does the council manage to cope with the vagaries of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle?

For the uninitiated, the quantum mechanics principle deals with the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the momentum and position of a sub-atomic particle.
