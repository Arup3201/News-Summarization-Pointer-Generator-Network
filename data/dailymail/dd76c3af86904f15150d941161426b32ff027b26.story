These pictures capture the incredible scenes as a woman mounted on three horses led thousands of sheep through the French city of Marseille.

They were taken yesterday during festivities held to celebrate Marseille-Provence being named the 2013 European Capital of Culture.

The visually-stunning parade was called 'TransHumance', after the seasonal migration of people with their livestock when herds are moved to new grazing grounds.

It was organised by the equestrian troupe of the Theatre du Centaure, with 7000 animals passing through the city centre with tens of thousands of people watching.

More than 150 Provençal and Italian herdsmen, using teams of horses and dogs, will cross Marseille, before finally stopping on the beaches of Marseille's iconic Prado in ‘a poetic journey celebrating nature’.

The 600 kilometre journey starts out a two different points and merges in l’Etang des Aulnes, before making the final journey towards Marseille. The riders were joined by walkers from all backgrounds and nationalities.

Retroblog Traveller describes TransHumance as 'sharing the experience of time and space'.

It added: 'Modern ways of communication and transport force the world to live in the same rhythm. Temporality is not respected anymore.

'By travelling together one can slow down one’s pace of life and experience the seasonal movement of people and cattle in the same way people did in ancient times, though in TransHumance's case with a modern twist.'

At each stage of the journey the choreographed movements of animals will be photographed from the air. These images will be used to create a mosaic of the different landscapes of Provence.
