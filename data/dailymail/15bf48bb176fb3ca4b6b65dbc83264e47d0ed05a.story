It's one of the most famous homes in Britain, but we recognise it best from its well-guarded front exteriors; it's rare we get to peek inside.

But now the doors to the Prime Minister's private apartments have been flung open, with David Cameron allowing photographers into his kitchen to capture him, on film, having a friendly chat with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

And naturally, being the inquisitive bunch we are, our eyes were immediately drawn to the PM's bookshelf, seeing if we could get an insight into how he Samantha spend their evenings at home.

We can now reveal that the backless £665 Oka frame is populated with high-end foodie tomes (The Ginger Pig Meat Book, The Flavour Thesaurus, The River Cottage Every Day by Hugh Fearnley-Whitingstall, a fellow Old Etonian and - most intriguingly - The Abs Diet), as well as  art and decor books (Art And Artists, Provence Interiors), DVD box sets (two series of 24), and current affairs and political reads (Jeremy Paxman: On Royalty).

What's on David's bookshelf? A photograph of Prime Minister David Cameron and German chancellor Angela Merkel chatting in his Downing Street apartments

Cookbooks and box sets: The Cameron family bookshelf is full of high-end foodie tomes - including The Flavour Thesaurus and the Ginger Pig Meat Book - and DVDs

The appearance of the diet tome, aimed at ridding people of their wobbly tummies, led some to wonder whether the Prime Minister might be worried about middle-age spread.

Blurb for the book claims it can help you lose 12lbs in just two weeks. Its website encourages dieters thus: 'Imagine yourself with great abs. Imagine the perfect look for you — be it a firm, flat, tight, sexy belly that looks great every day or a ripped abdominal "six-pack" you can show off on the beach.'

A similar photo, including another fascinating insight into the family's reading habits, was taken in number 11 Downing Street (where the family live instead of in number 10, because the apartments are bigger) in 2011, featuring Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama.

In that photo other books spotted were a Paris Interiors coffee table book, The Family Cookbook, the Complete Works of William Shakespeare, a large selection of children's books, and Mrs Beeton's Household Management.

On the DVD shelf the family had a special edition Star Wars box set, a Desperate Housewives box set, a Brideshead Revisited box set, a Band of Brothers box set, Michael McIntyre Live and Laughing, Armageddon, The Departed, Goodfellas, Yes Man, Kill Bill, SpongeBob SquarePants and Wiggles.

Since 2011 the family have also replaced their old toaster and kettle set with smart matching yellow appliances from the Kenwood kMix range, £59.99 each They still have the mustard yellow Fancy Nancy sofa they had three years ago.

Today Mr Cameron tweeted a photograph of the occasion, remarking: 'I'm happy to welcome Angela Merkel to my Downing St flat, after her excellent address to Parliament.'

Tweet tweet! David Cameron posted a picture of himself and Mrs Merkel in his kitchen on Twitter after their meeting

Tea with Dave: During her one-day visit to the UK, Mrs Merkel will hold meetings with the leaders of the three main political parties, as well as having tea with Queen Elizabeth Buckingham Palace

The apartment is still as modern, neat and clean as it was when it was seen in 2011, the graphite kitchen cabinets (Round 
House Design) provide a neutral palette that allows the stylish £1,431 
yellow custom-covered Fancy Nancy sofa from fashionable British store Sofa Workshop to really pop.

In 2011 the room was shown in considerably more detail.

On the underlit shelves,
gleaming Jamie Oliver saucepans were perfectly aligned, their handles 
pointing at identical angles; the sparkling glasses arranged neatly 
in descending height 
order.

THE BOOKS:

THE DVDs:

Obviously keen cooks, the Camerons 
have a range of top notch kitchen gadgets. A £500 coffee machine by 
Italian brand Rancilio - regarded as the gold standard for coffee lovers
 - and a £299 Magimix 
food processor sit to the left of a smart £3,799 Britannia Sigma range 
oven (said to be one of the finest on offer), its £799 Britannia Living 
hood as highly polished as the stainless 
steel splashback behind.

A £74.99 Panasonic microwave sat corner but has been moved to a more prominent location now, and in 2011 a bottle steriliser and £3.99 blue plastic 
Tommee Tippee baby cup were visible, marking this out as a family home with three young children.

On
 the bookcase - the £665 library shelves in black from OKA direct to be 
precise, the interiors website owned by SamCam's mother - the DVDs and 
books, neatly arranged by height, can just be made out.

Among the 
collection 
we see coffee table books from renowned publishers Taschen on art, 
design and French interiors - perhaps 
Samantha looked to 
them for inspiration for her kitchen? - as well as Mrs Beeton's 
Household management tome, plenty of
children's reads - and that highbrow essential, William Shakespeare's 
complete works.

A large DVD collection offers insight into the possibilities of a Cameron night in front of the television:

Box
 sets of 24, Brideshead Revisited 
and Desperate Housewives can be spotted, along with a special edition, 
digitally enhanced box set of Star Wars, indicating that one of the 
Camerons is a big fan. 

There are two live stand-up comedy DVDs from the Live and Laughing tour of popular comedian Michael 
McIntyre - perhaps David Cameron's way of lightening his mood after a 
difficult PM's question time - and drama is provided by films 
including Yes Man, Bruce Willis' Armageddon, The Departed and Goodfellas.

One
 assumes the SpongeBob SquarePants and Wiggles DVDs are for the 
Camerons' children - seven-year-old Nancy, Arthur, five, and 
nine-month-old Florence.

On the sideboard is a shiny new Phillips 21:9 flatscreen television and two - yes TWO - Apple iPads (purchased, of course, 
with no help from Parliamentary expenses), while underneath sits a Sky+ 
box for those quiet nights in.

When the Camerons moved into their 
new four-bedroom apartment (which they use 
because it’s bigger than the family accommodation at No 10), Samantha 
Cameron is said to have despaired at the dark, poky kitchen.

Cherie Blair had previously admitted that when she saw the kitchen at No 11, her heart sank; it was so awful and outdated.

But
 at the time the Blairs moved in, they couldn’t afford to splash out.

Thanks to the the PM and his wife's personal 
financial security, however, the Camerons could - and wouldn't Cherie 
have loved this modern, airy space, with its top-of-the-range 
accessories and gleaming pans?

Instead of replacing the shabby 1970s kitchen 
already there, this large, bright, contemporary kitchen was built in addition.

While
 it's much more modern than the Cameron's white and beige wood kitchen 
at their former residence in Notting Hill, some of the contemporary 
touches are the same - the modern fixtures and fittings are familiar, 
but the sophisticated grey tone is all new.

Gone, or perhaps out of 
sight, are the £99 pendant light and £130 Flap City clock from 
Habitat, the £175 Waring blender, the £100 Brabantia bin and the £360 
Tom Dixon for Heals Mirror Ball light.

For
 all their fabulous wealth though, the Camerons show that they're not 
unnecessarily lavish: the large set of stainless steel pans and knife block are back 
in use at No 11.

Lived-in: David Cameron in the modern kitchen at his former residence in
 Notting Hill - note the same pans and knife block have resurfaced in 
the new kitchen at No 11
