Tottenham are close to completing the signing of right-back DeAndre Yedlin, according to his Seattle Sounders manager Sigi Schmid.

Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping to strengthen that area of his side ahead of the start of the Premier League this season, especially with first-choice right-back Kyle Walker still on the recovery from the injury that prevented him from going to the World Cup.

And, according to Schmid, Spurs are near to completing a deal for the 21-year-old American.

'Yedlin's situation is very close,' said the Seattle boss.

'Some things are not entirely completed yet so we didn't want to play him and have the risk of injury without everything being finalised, but hopefully it will be completed in the next day or two.'

Yedlin made three substitute appearances for the USA at the World Cup as they reached the last-16, and he would become Spurs' fourth signing of the summer after Ben Davies and Michel Vorm arrived from Swansea, and Eric Dier from Sporting Lisbon.
