These are the images that capture Australian life in just one moment... and they're all proudly posted on Instagram for the world to see.

Photographers from right across the country take a shot at success in the Art & About Sydney's photography competition every year, but for the first time in 2014 organisers have included a Instagram category.

More than 15,000 photos have already been submitted via social media using the hashtag #Australianlife.

The competition invites people to submit images taken from across the country that give a unique glimpse into Australian life.

Twenty two finalists will be chosen and exhibited in Sydney's Hyde Park in September, with the winner set to take home $10,000.

The mobile photographer who takes out the Instagram category will win $5,000.

Here's a sample of what has already been submitted...
