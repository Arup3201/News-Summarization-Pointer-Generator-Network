First they hired a high fashion male model who is more used to working with Tom Ford than Teflon-covered trousers.

Then they unveiled their latest collection at a glamorous catwalk show, and now they have revealed a glossy shoot that wouldn't look out of place in an issue of Vogue.

It seems that once-upon-a-time supermarket bargain brand F&F is all grown up.

Makeover: F&F has unveiled a slick autumn/winter collection, available in Tesco (jacket £40, top £12)

This season the label's clothes even come with a theme with the designers hope to symbolise 'bravery' and a 'carefree attitude'.

'We see the F&F woman come full circle from ladylike chic to rebel with a cause; a smart, independent, modern woman with a desire to challenge the ordinary and tear up the rule book.

'It’s an empowering feeling,' said a spokesman.

In a nod to the 90s luxury grunge trend seen on last season's catwalks, the new range is a juxtaposition of texture and fabric featuring black leather-look biker jackets and graphic print dresses, as well as pops of colour in the form of cobalt blue and pillar box red.

On-trend: In a nod to the catwalks - which saw tartan and masculine styles a staple - F&F are offering the trends at a lower price (jacket £35, blouse £14, trousers £20)

Wrap up in style: The coat is a staple item in their new collection and comes in an array of colours (L- £45), as well as more minimalistic styles (R-£40)

On-trend sheer blouses and tailored blazers are teamed with high-waisted trousers to help women embrace the 'power dressing' trend on a budget.

Highlights include a highly wearable 
cobalt shift dress, a rock n' roll A-line skirt with a daring sheer side
 panel and some covetable cerulean knits.1

And Chanel-inspired tartan prints feature alongside more delicate bird prints on jackets, dresses and jumpers.

Getting graphic: Prints are also at the forefront for autumn/winter including this urban graffiti print jumper (£20)

For men, there's more than a hint of 
the Highland thanks to soft cotton shirts, again in tartan, and cosy knits thick
 enough to see off the coldest North Sea gales.

While urban
 types will appreciate the well-cut grey blazer, charcoal washed jeans 
and tailored banker-friendly chinos at bank balance-friendly prices.

Wearable: Highlights include a highly wearable cobalt shift jumper and skirt (L-£14, £12) and flattering print dresses
