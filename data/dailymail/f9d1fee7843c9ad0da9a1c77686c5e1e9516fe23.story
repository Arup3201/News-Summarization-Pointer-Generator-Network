The Duke of York was showered in presents during at least seven international trips last year - which included visits to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Under-fire Prince Andrew received scores of  gifts from dignitaries and organisations from around the world  - including an Arctic Monkey's CD, ten boxes of mangoes and an empty photo album.

During Andrew's  overseas and UK trips he was handed well over 100 presents, which also included clothing, food, many books and a number of scale models.

The 'gift list' reveals Andrew made at least seven trips abroad last year, receiving gifts from local dignitaries

Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family published their 'gift lists' today, detailing everything they have been presented with over the last year.

Andrew is a full-time working member of the Royal Family and works around the world to promote economic growth and job creation in the UK.

Once nicknamed 'Airmiles Andy' because of his penchant for luxury air travel, he has recently focused his activity on promoting entrepreneurship and technology.

An Arctic Monkeys CD and wristband was perhaps the most unlikely gift the senior royal received as part of his duties, being given the present by West Yorkshire children's charity, Kidzaware, during a visit in October.

Former First Lady Hilary Clinton was the most famous gift-giver to the Duke, sending him a copy of her book 'Hard Choices'.

It was one of a great number of volumes the Duke was sent, which included books on the cars of Havana, the 12th Light Dragoons, Kuwaiti Civil Aviation and the 'Golden Age' of Saudi Arabia. 

He also received a large amount of treats and snacks, with the Prime Minister of Pakistan sending him 10 boxes of mangoes, a fruit which used to convey best wishes in the South Asian country.

The Duke was also given some Kentish fudge, a platter of dates from the Saudi Arabian ambassador and salt and pepper shakers from a university training scheme.

Andrew was also sent a platter of dates from Saudi Arabian Ambassador - Mohammed bin Nawaf Al-Saud.

He was presented with a decorative metal box from the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Sheik Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa.

The Crown Prince pulled out of attending the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in April 2011 following unrest in Bahrain. Human rights campaigners had petitioned against his attendance because of his government's treatment of protesters.

Other gifts Andrew received during his official trip to Bahrain last January included a floral display from Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa - who has been Bahrain's Prime Minister for the last 43 years. 

He was handed a number of scale models, including many of buildings, aeroplanes, one a Kuwaiti dow and others of a missile, an elephant and a horse. He was also given cufflinks, a number of ties, a necklace, a turban and a scarf.

He also got given a personalised mug of himself and a framed section of Lord Nelson's mainsail, the records show.

Over the last month, Prince Andrew has come under fire over his past friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with an 'under-age' girl, widely named as Virginia Roberts.

Ms Roberts - now said to be a married mother-of-three in her 30s - alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.

Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations, which it says are 'false and without any foundation'.

Andrew was not the only royal to release his gift list today. Among the 27 presents Prince Charles was given for Prince George in Canada last May was a pewter teddy, a bag of chocolate coins and a tartan blanket.

The Queen received a dressage crop from the Governor General of Canada, a large wooden coffee grinder from a Jordanian ambassador at a 'Dine and Sleep Party held at Windsor Castle' and two hand-crafted tribal arrows from the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Maryland.

She returned from Northern Ireland in June with a miniature 7 inch throne from the Game of Thrones series.
