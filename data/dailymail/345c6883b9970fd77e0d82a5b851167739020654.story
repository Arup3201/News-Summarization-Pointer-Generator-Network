Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops by 2012 - the console is said to be twice as powerful as Xbox 360, and has a tablet-style controller which works as a secondary screen. Full details will be revealed in May

Nintendo's new Wii U console will be in shops in Europe, Japan and America by the end of 2012, the company announced today.

The move came after the Japanese game giant revealed a sharp drop in quarterly profit, as its consoles battled with devices such as Apple's iPhone. 

The arrival of big-name franchises such as Super Mario 3D Land on the company's glasses-free 3DS console failed to lift figures for the last quarter.

Nintendo cut its forecast for annual 
sales of its ageing Wii console to 10 million devices from 12 million, 
and for the 3DS handheld games device to 14 million from 16 million.   

The new Wii U console is said to be twice as 
powerful as Xbox 360, according to the latest rumours, and features a 
tablet-style controller with a built-in screen.

Details will be revealed
in May.

The creator of the Super Mario franchise dominated the video games industry for years with its DS handheld and Wii home consoles, but is now struggling to keep up as more versatile smartphone and tablet sales boom.    

'To say that (the days of consoles) are over is likely an overstatement, but social network and Internet delivered games are growing, which is a strong wind against Nintendo,' said Shigeo Sugawara, senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management.

Nintendo's big franchises such as The Legend of Zelda remain exclusive to its consoles - but analysts now question whether their business model can survive in the age of iPhone

Nintendo now expects an annual operating loss of 45 billion yen ($575 million), dwarfing expectations of a 4.2 billion yen loss, based on the average of 21 analyst forecasts.   

'We had higher expectations for the year-end season, but failed to meet them,' President Satoru Iwata told reporters in Osaka.        Poor sales forced Nintendo to slash the price of its much-anticipated 3DS handheld games device in August, just six months after its launch.     

The move halted its record of making profits on games hardware as well as software, a business model that took operating income to a high of 555 billion yen in 2008/09.    The company plans to launch the Wii's successor, the Wii U, in Japan, the United States, Europe and Australia in the year-end season, Iwata told reporters.    

But with cloud-based gaming emerging as a potential threat, Nintendo may have trouble generating excitement about its new product, some analysts say.

Google is taking steps into gaming with Google TV, while Apple is thought to be preparing a new iPad and possibly a smart TV that could be game-changers for the industry. 

'We think we need to consider the possibility that home consoles could become a thing of the past,' Citigroup analyst Soichiro Fukuda wrote in a recent report.
