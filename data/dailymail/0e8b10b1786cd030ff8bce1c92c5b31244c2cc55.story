The executive who ran HSBC while it laundered money for drug barons and terrorists yesterday quit his new role as a trade minister.

The departure of Lord Green came on the same day that the government pledged to bring in laws to jail bosses of failed lenders.

Number 10 sources insisted the peer's role at the bank had nothing to do with his decision to stand down, saying he had always intended to go after two to three years.

However, his continued presence in a key role promoting UK businesses overseas would have been a serious embarrassment to the Coalition as it seeks to reform the banking sector.

The peer's exit was revealed by David Cameron as he vowed to follow the recommendations of an investigation that found 'deep lapses in standards' in the UK banking system.

He is the second former bank boss to resign within hours of the report from the Parliamentary Banking Commission, which recommended executives guilty of 'reckless mismanagement' should face jail, delayed bonuses or pension cancellations.

Neville Richardson, former head of the Co-operative Bank, quit on Tuesday night as a director of Marks & Spencer bank and of estate agent Countrywide.

The Co-op Bank was this week forced to announce plans to shed its mutual status in order to plug a £1.5billion black hole in its capital. Mr Cameron told the Commons that he would accept the recommendations of the Banking Commission, which called for new legislation and rules that will allow bonuses to be clawed back.

Downing Street officials say that ministers will add amendments to the banking Bill going through Parliament.

'Penalising, including with criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly – I say yes,' Mr Cameron told MPs. 'Also, making sure that for banks in receipt of taxpayers' money we can claw back and have a ban on bonuses – I say yes too.'

But Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Government has done little to curb bonuses, citing figures released last week that show they rose 64 per cent in April compared with the same month a year ago. He said the surge was due to bankers deferring their bonuses until the top rate of tax was cut from 50p to 45p in the pound. 'People took their bonuses in April, and were given a massive tax cut as a result,' he said.

Lord Green faced questions about his role after a US Senate investigation found that HSBC did not take sufficient action to prevent money laundering during his time as chief executive and chairman. The Conservative peer joined the bank in 1982 and rose to the top job in 2003 – a year after it bought a Mexican bank linked to alleged laundering of drug money.

He was chairman from 2005 to 2010 before being given a government role by David Cameron. During his time at the top, the bank also did business with banks linked to terrorism. It was fined £1.2billion by US authorities, but Lord Green claimed in a letter last year that he had 'no case to answer'.

He will now be replaced in his ministerial role by Ian Livingstone, the chief executive of BT.

A Number 10 source said it was 'delighted' to appoint Mr Livingstone, who will be handed a peerage. The Banking Commission report has largely completed a purge on the shamed bosses who brought Britain's financial system to the edge of bankruptcy.

Former HBOS chief James Crosby this month forfeited his knighthood and agreed to have his £580,000-a-year pension cut by a third. Fred Goodwin, who presided over the £45billion collapse of RBS, had his knighthood removed last year and is living on a reduced annual pension of £342,000. Barclays supremo Bob Diamond was ousted last year following the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal.

The only banker of the credit crisis years still occupying a chief executive's chair is Andy Hornby, who runs bookmaker Gala Coral.

The privately-owned betting firm last night said he has the full backing of the board. A Number 10 source insisted Lord Green's past stewardship of the bank had nothing to do with his decision to stand down as a minister.

'He has always made clear that he would leave after two or three years, by the time it gets to December he will have been there for around three years,' the source said.

'We are delighted that we have got someone of the stature of Ian Livingston to replace him.'
