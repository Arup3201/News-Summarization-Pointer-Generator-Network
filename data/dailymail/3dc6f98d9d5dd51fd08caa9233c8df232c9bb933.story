NSW bowler Sean Abbott has returned to action for the first time since the death of Phillip Hughes, bowling with pace, confidence and, most importantly, an enormous smile on his face.

In an incredible display of courage, Abbott returned the Sydney Cricket Ground, the same ground where Australian cricket player Hughes was felled exactly two weeks ago.  

The wellbeing and mental health of the 22-year-old has been of great concern to many since the freak accident when he bowled the fatal bouncer to Hughes.

People across the globe have rallied around the young player, including Hughes' family, who told Daily Mail Australia that they '(couldn't) wait to see him, give him a big hug and tell him everything is okay.'

Australian captain Michael Clarke promised that when Abbott was ready to bowl again, he would 'be the first to strap on the pads and go stand up the end of the net to hit them back at (him).' 

But it was a new day for Sean Abbott as he stepped out for New South Wales, taking on Queensland in the Sheffield Shield competition. 

He was handed the ball for the 13th over of the day and, to the relief of the nation, took to the task with abandon. 

Abbott even had the courage to bowl a bouncer on just his fifth ball and then continue to , indicating that the game will indeed go on.

He bowled with speed and great energy; celebrating his two wickets with his team mates and cheering ecstatically.

It was a demonstration of his great strength of character and the steadfast support that he continues to receive.  

Hughes' closest friends and family indicate that this enjoyment of the game  is exactly what the 25-year-old opening batsman would have wanted, as he 'lived for cricket'.

Abbott received a warm round of applause from the crowd when he was introduced into the attack in his first outing since Phillip Hughes' death. 

With 'PJH 707' on his shirt, referencing Hughes' Baggy Blue number from his time with the NSW Blues, Abbott began his take down of the Queensland batsmen. 

He began by bowling four dot balls before delivering his first bouncer to Queensland batsman, Joe Burns, the ball sailing over the batsmen's head. 

He took his first ball by bowling Nathan Reardon for six. Abbott flung his arms into the air gleefully, as his team mates ran towards him to celebrate.

His second wicket came soon after, when Queensland's Ben Cutting edged Abbott's delivery, clipping it straight into the gloves of wicketkeeper Peter Nevill.

The four-day Sheffield Shield match against Queensland is the first fixture at the SCG since Hughes was struck in the back of the head by a bouncer on November 25

Queensland were all out for 268 and New South Wales finished the day 1-17, although the score was insignificant in comparison to the progress that the game and its players made that day in overcoming unthinkable tragedy.  

Sean Abbott's bravery comes as Australia's cricket team also made a belated return to the Test arena on Tuesday, for the Test against India at the Adelaide Oval and the players there posted images of Sean Abbott in their lockers in a show of support for the young paceman.

Abbott was devastated by the death of his former team mate two days later and received of a wave of support from fellow players in Australia and around the world.

Traumatised by Hughes' death, Abbott chose to sit out last weekend's resumption of Sydney grade cricket but on Monday, after emotional embraces from team-mates, he threw himself into a full training session. 

The home side lost the toss and fielded first on Tuesday, giving Abbott an early opportunity to get back into his stride.

Queensland were 1-88 at lunch with Joe Burns not out on 42 and Usman Khawaja unbeaten on five.

The Bulls batsmen were rarely troubled during the first session until Marnus Labuschagne (39) was dismissed by Will Somerville's second ball.

Somerville went into the break with 1 for 2 while Abbott had the economical with figures of 0-13 off five overs.

While there has been discussion about the bouncer's place in the game in the wake of Hughes' death, the first of the match came and went with little fanfare.

Doug Bollinger dropped it in short to Burns in the sixth over and the Queensland opener ducked under the ball comfortably.

Hughes played 37 first class matches for his home state before moving to the Adelaide Oval, where the first test against India also begins on Tuesday morning, to join South Australia. 

After the funeral in his home town of Macksville last week attracted thousands of mourners, plans to hold a state memorial service for Hughes in Sydney have been scrapped.

'All parties felt that given the enormous outpouring of support at last Wednesday's funeral, a state memorial service would no longer need to be held,' New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said.

'Last Wednesday's funeral in Macksville was a wonderful service and a fitting tribute to Phillip's life and it was a privilege to be a part of it.

Abbott, who made his international debut in October, returned to training with NSW last Tuesday and was among the more than 5000 mourners at Hughes's funeral the next day in the northern NSW town of Macksville.

Hughes' death sent shockwaves through the international cricket community, and senior Australian players have conceded that returning to the playing field has been a challenge.

There has been speculation Abbott may be too traumatised by Hughes' death to make a full and effective return to the sport.

Abbott has been supported by all parts of the cricket community, including Hughes' family and Australian captain Michael Clarke.

Cricket NSW said all players, Abbott included, were given the opportunity to decide when they want to return to playing.

The SCG wicket where Hughes was struck has been retired by groundskeepers and will not feature again during Australia's summer of cricket.

Trauma experts say the impact of Hughes's death might not sink in for Abbott for weeks.

But they also say that returning to training and competition, if he's surrounded by supportive team-mates, could help him recover quicker from any psychological damage.

Phillip Hughes died on November 27 after suffering a head injury two days earlier while batting for his adopted state South Australia against his home state New South Wales two days earlier

The pitch on which Phillip Hughes was stricken by a bouncer will no longer be used this summer

Hughes' grieving South Australian team-mates are also yet to decide if they will play Tasmania in the next round of the Sheffield Shield.

'I wouldn't recommend (the players) stay away (from the sport) at all, actually,' said Michael Burge, director of the Australian College of Trauma Treatment.

'They just need to be taking into account that they may be a little bit awkward or not quite on their game as they were for a few weeks.'
