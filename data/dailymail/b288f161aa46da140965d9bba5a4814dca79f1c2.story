The Duke of Edinburgh was seen enjoying the spring-like weather while driving a carriage of four horses through the Windsor town centre.

Prince Philip squinted against the sun as the horses trotted along the road while he chatted to a female passenger.

The prince looked healthy and happy during his trip out in the sunshine earlier this week.The 93-year-old is an avid carriage driver - taking up the sport in 1971 after giving up polo.

He is even credited with developing the sport - and an early carriage driving rule book was drafted under his supervision.  

He began driving ponies, before progressing to Cleveland Bay horses. By 1973 he felt that he was suitably proficient to take up the sport competitively and he still enters carriage driving competitions today having achieved several wins in regional competitions. 

In his book ‘30 years on and off the box seat’ The Duke of Edinburgh describes the appeal of the sport: ‘I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside. 

'I have been fortunate to have had a longer innings than most, and I have no intention of giving up while I have a team of willing ponies and dedicated staff and while I can still cope with the challenges which carriage driving presents me with.’

In recent years, the prince has suffered several bouts of ill-health, however, the most serious of which was over Christmas 2011 when he was rushed into hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery, which involved him having a stent fitted.  

He was also forced to pull out of several key engagements to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 having developed a severe bladder infection after being forced to stand for hours in driving wind and rain during a celebratory river pageant.

He also spent his birthday - June 10 - in 2013 in hospital after undergoing an ‘exploratory’ operation for unexplained abdominal pain. The results of the tests have never been released.

Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy - you might as well take your life in your hands.’

'The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss.'
