Accused: Derek Annan is accused of being part of a failed plot to steal £3million from RBS customers' accounts

A bank cashier has denied being part of a plot to steal almost £3million from Royal Bank of Scotland customers' accounts.

Derek Annan, 24, is accused of passing customers' security details and passwords on to fraudsters who attempted to withdraw large sums of money from their accounts.

The gang had only managed to take £135,000 before they were caught, but attempts were made to withdraw a further £2.5million.

The Old Bailey heard that members of the gang would go into RBS branches and attempt to cash cheques stolen from their victims using fake identification.

If they were challenged with security questions by the cashier, they were able to answer the questions thanks to the information allegedly supplied by Annan, who worked part time at RBS branches in Chelmsford and Colchester, in Essex.

Prosecutor Nicola Merrick told the court that Annan provided the names of signatories on bank accounts, information about the signatures themselves, how much money was in the accounts as well as security details and passwords.

One of the victims, Peter Hewitt, from
Solihull, West Midlands, had £14,800 taken from his account in three 
withdrawals in January 2011.

LM Funerals Ltd had its chequebook stolen and 98 cheques were put 
through the banking system in an attempt to take around £836,000 in May 
2011.

Fortunately, RBS investigator Richard Cross discovered the fraud before the gang were able to steal any more money.

A subsequent probe found that each account had been accessed by Annan shortly before the cash was withdrawn.

Annan, who worked part time for RBS while 
studying finance at Southbank University, in south London, was arrested on suspicion of fraud in December 2011, but denied any involvement.

He was arrested for a second time in March of this year in connection with another 20 attempts to defraud RBS customers.

This time he refused to answer police questions, the court heard.

Ms Merrick said: ‘Mr Annan obtained (customers') information because as a bank employee he was able to access accounts and get all of that information and provide it to others.

‘The defendant played an important and significant role, along with others, to ensure the frauds in counts one to 11 were successful and played a significant role in attempting to ensure the fraud in count 12 was successful, although it was not.'

Annan, of Chafford Hundred, Essex, denies 11 fraud charges relating to £135,500 and an attempted fraud charge concerning a further £2.5 million.

The trial continues.
