Panic: Business Secretary Vince Cable warned public fears over immigration risked harming the economy

Britain’s economy is being damaged by public ‘panic’ over immigration, Vince Cable warned today.

The Business Secretary claimed government policy aimed at cutting the number of people moving to the UK were deterring investors and created ‘absurd’ obstacles for students.

He was backed by London Mayor Boris Johnson who warned ambitions to reduce immigration must not be met by cutting the number of foreign students signing up to UK universities.

David Cameron has said he wants to see net migration fall to the ‘tens of thousands’ by 2015.

Official figures last week showed the number of immigrants coming into Britain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade.

Half a million from abroad came to live here in the 12 months to the end of last September, the smallest number since 2001.

But much of the drop came from a 22 per cent decrease in the number of foreign students.

However, Mr Cable said that because overseas students were counted as immigrants under international rules, their number was ‘easily translated into a flood of immigrants’.

He added: ‘When, last week, the number declines, this is a great triumph for immigration control, which is quite absurd and unfortunately is seriously distorting the debate on sensible university policy and, indeed, sensible immigration policy.

‘I just want to make absolutely clear, as far as the Government is concerned we have no cap on the number of overseas students, we don't propose to introduce one.’

The Business Secretary warned the debate over immigration ‘does incubate these very deep emotional feelings about foreigners’.

‘I was at one of our leading engineering companies a few months ago.

‘I was introduced to the chief engineer, who was making the most sophisticated engines for Formula 1 cars and he happened to be Indian, and he was coming to the end of his visa and under the existing rules he was going to have to go back to India and reapply for admission to the UK, right in the middle of a high-pressure contract. It was completely absurd.

‘But that is the kind of restriction that is introduced in order to placate public panic that does create an economic harm.’

Drop: Net migration is now at its lowest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics show

In a speech to the Global University Summit in London, Mr Cable acknowledged there was a ‘serious problem’ of perception which had been caused by the Government's immigration restrictions, particularly in India.

‘In India there has been a quite vigorous criticism of the UK, largely I think following the debate in British newspapers and treating that as if it was objective reality, which it isn't necessarily,’ Mr Cable said.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said a drop in foreign students to the UK was not something to be celebrated

‘In some of the Indian vernacular 
newspapers the message has gone out that the British no longer want 
Indian students, which is wrong but that's the message that has gone 
out.’

There had been a ‘substantial’ reduction in the number of Indian students as a result, he added.

Mr Cable's concerns about a reduction in foreign students were echoed by London Mayor Boris Johnson at the same event.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I looked at the recent figures for foreign students coming to this country and I do not regard what seemed to me to be a reduction in those numbers as necessarily a positive economic indicator.

‘I think we need to push higher education as a great, great international export and we need to be even more open in our dealings with other HE institutions around the world.’

Planning minister Nick Boles last night warned immigration is helping to fuel rises in house prices that are preventing young people from owning their own home

He told the Mail: ‘I have become much more critical of immigration.

'A very substantial contribution to housing need comes from the level of immigration in the past two decades.’
