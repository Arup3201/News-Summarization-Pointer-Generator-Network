A two-star U.S. Army general who failed to investigate claims of sexual assault against a colonel on his staff has been stripped of his rank and forced to retire.

The Army has announced that Major General Michael T. Harrison will be retired as a brigadier general after being suspended from his duties as commander of U.S. forces in Japan.

Under federal law, commissioned officers retire at the highest rank in which they are determined to have served satisfactorily.

But after a decision by Army Secretary John M. McHugh, a brief statement was released confirming that his highest grade of satisfactory service was a brigadier general.

An inspector general's investigation 
report released in April said that in March 2013 a Japanese woman 
accused the unidentified colonel on Harrison's staff, who he had known 
for 20 years, of sexually assaulting her.

But Harrison waited months to report it to criminal investigators, which was deemed a violation of Army rules.

In the report it was also said that he failed to treat the alleged victim with dignity and fairness and failed to remove the colonel from his position despite a pattern of allegations, according to Stars and Stripes.

But despite his subsequent suspension, the Army brought him to the Pentagon to make him director of programme analysis and evaluation for an Army deputy chief of staff.

The Washington Post reported in April that he received an administrative letter of reprimand in December 2013 for mishandling the sexual-assault case and other complaints in Japan, but remained on active duty.

His case has been cited as evidence of why sex-crime victims say they don't trust the military to protect them, despite efforts by senior Pentagon officials, including Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, to make commanders accountable.

In March the Pentagon turned back an effort in Congress to strip commanders of the authority to prosecute cases, especially those related to sexual assault, and hand the job to seasoned military lawyers.

Harrison joined the Army in 1980 and served in numerous capacities around the world.

He is due to retire next month but stands to lose a substantial amount of retirement pay.
