Melissa Reid made the warning on the eve of her 21st birthday

Drug mule Melissa Reid has issued a stark warning – from her grim prison cell – to youngsters starting their gap year not to follow her wild, drug-fuelled lifestyle in Ibiza.

On the eve of her 21st birthday – a year after being caught smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru – she has warned of the perils of having too much ‘fun’ on the Mediterranean party island.

In a diary entry from her new prison, Ancon 2 – surrounded by shanty towns hours outside Lima in the Peruvian desert – Reid, who is serving a near seven-year sentence, wrote: ‘A year ago today, if someone was warning me of the dangers of drug smuggling, I would probably tell them to f*** off. And how I would not be so stupid and how it would never happen to me. But look at me now, Modulo 1, Pabellon 3B of Ancon 2 prison, Peru. So just get the word out for me and tell anyone that will listen, it’s not smart, not big and definitely not clever.

‘As glamorous as the drug lords make it out, it’s not. Our generation are always finding a new, low budget, fast-hitting drug – if it’s not Ket [Ketamine], it’s pills or coke [cocaine], and why not throw a bit of acid in to make it a real night to remember!

She writes ‘it’s this crazy lifestyle’ that got her into trouble in Ibiza. ‘The island of your dreams – oh sorry, you mean the island where everyone is living in a dream. Good luck when you come back to reality is all I can say!’

She added: ‘Who knows, I might even be back in Ibiza one day myself, although with a different head on my shoulders and the only thing I would do with the line of coke you put out for me on the key to our apartment, on the dance floor of a nightclub, is blow it back in your face!

'I will also now be watching my back for years to come and double checking the door is locked every night because, as everyone knows, drugs is a big boys’ game!

‘Once you have seen a man pulling liquid cocaine condoms from his a***; a woman being sick and having diarrhoea in a hole in the ground at the same time, and a child being separated from her mother at three years old so her mother can serve a 15-year prison service, as I have, you have had more than enough!’

Melissa, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, and Belfast-born Michaella McCollum Connolly, 21, had travelled separately to the Spanish isle of Ibiza last year to enjoy a summer of partying.

But they ended up flying to Lima, where they were caught attempting to smuggle cocaine out of the country in their suitcases.

They claimed they were forced into the drugs run by gangsters but they later dropped that tale and were each sentenced to six years and eight months after pleading guilty.

Melissa’s parents are currently in Peru visiting their daughter and last Saturday her mother Debbie took a chocolate cake into the prison for her to celebrate her 21st birthday.

The 54-year-old mother of four said: ‘This time last year I thought maybe Melissa might be home for her 21st. Obviously not. I took in lots of cards from friends and family.

'We got her a sash and everyone joined in when we were singing happy birthday.’

Her husband, Billy, 54, added: ‘We’re making the best of a bad situation. The key to the door takes on a new meaning in her predicament.’

The duo tried to smuggle £1.5m worth of cocaine on a flight to Spain from Peru. They are now sharing a cell together in the prison, along with six other prisoners

Melissa and Michaella share a cramped cell with six other prisoners, sleeping on opposite top bunks. Locked away from 6pm to 6am, they spend their time reading and, of late, knitting. The toilet in the middle of the cell is a hole in the ground.

The pair, who have been dubbed ‘The Peru Two’, are clinging to hopes of a prisoner transfer to the UK.

Earlier this month those hopes appeared to have been bolstered after it emerged Peruvian authorities confirmed they had ‘accepted’ Michaella’s prison transfer request.
