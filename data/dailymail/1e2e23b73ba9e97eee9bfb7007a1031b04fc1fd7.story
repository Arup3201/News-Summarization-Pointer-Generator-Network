Alex Hales appears set to become captain Alastair Cook's new opening partner after being named in England's 15-man Royal London Series squad to face India.

Hales, currently in the form of his life, will have to displace Ian Bell at the top of the order if he is to get the chance to carry his brilliant hitting from county limited-overs cricket and Twenty20 for England into the 50-over international arena.

Eyes on the prize: Hales has been called up to the ODI squad after some blistering T20 performances for England

England squad for one-day international Royal London Series against India, starting on August 25:

AN Cook (captain), MM Ali, JM Anderson, GS Ballance, IR Bell, JC Buttler (wkt), ST Finn, HF Gurney, AD Hales, CJ Jordan, EJG Morgan, JE Root, BA Stokes, JC Tredwell, CR Woakes.

The 25-year-old, uncapped as yet in one-day internationals, joins a squad which will be missing frontline seamer Stuart Broad - due to see a specialist this week to assess what to do about his long-term knee injury - and containing instead a back-in-favour Steven Finn.

Fellow fast bowler James Anderson is included, despite suggestions that he might benefit from a rest after England concluded their sequence of five back-to-back Test matches with a 3-1 Investec Series victory over India only on Sunday.
