Hong Kong's leader offered new talks with student leaders today, hours after police pepper sprayed protesters camped out in the city's streets.

Leung Chun-ying held out the olive branch to pro-democracy campaigners as tensions rose in Hong Kong over the savage beating of an activist by plainclothes police.

Public anger has simmered over after local TV aired footage of officers kicking a handcuffed protester overnight, as police in formation charged demonstrators barricading a highway underpass.

Defences: Pro-democracy protesters stand behind umbrellas, which they use to defend against the spray

Heightening tensions, police used pepper spray again after midnight this morning to push back crowds trying to occupy a road outside the government's headquarters.

Two protesters were arrested, police said, one for kicking a bottle at a car and one for assaulting police. Three officers were injured.

The beating of democracy activist Ken Tsang by police appeared to mark a change in mood for many protesters.

'I used to say at every rally that frontline police officers were just following orders. We shouldn't hurt frontline officers because we were angry or because we blamed them. Frontline officers were just doing their jobs,' Joshua Wong, the 18-year old leader of Scholarism, one of three main groups leading the protests, told a rally Wednesday evening at the main protest zone in Admiralty.

'But I won't say this again at future rallies. If they're just doing they're work, why do they have to beat people?'

Mabel Au, director of Amnesty Hong Kong, said: 'It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law.'

Tense: Police face off with protesters outside Hong Kong's government offices 

Intimidating: Helmeted police brandish their metal truncheons before moving in to attack protesters

Calm: Cameras flash as police officers stand face-to-face with protesters on Lung Wo Road

The attitude towards police has changed since the beating of pro-democracy activist Ken Tsang this week

The U.S. called for a 'swift, transparent and complete' investigation into the beating, saying it was 'deeply concerned' by the police brutality reports.

'We encourage Hong Kong authorities to carry out a swift, transparent, and complete investigation into the incident,' said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

'We renew our call for the Hong Kong government to show restraint, and for protesters to continue to express their views peacefully.'

Prime Minister David Cameron meanwhile said Britain would stand up for Hong Kong's rights and freedoms, 'including those of person, of speech, of the press, of assembly', while his spokesman later urged restraint from police and protesters.

Caught: The whole incident involving plainclothes police was filmed and broadcast by local network TVB

The two sides appear to be engaged in a cat-and-mouse game as the protests go into their third week.

Earlier this week, police had removed barriers on the edges of the protest zones in an apparent attempt to chip away at the three main protest zones that have blocked traffic and angered some local businesses.

Protesters reacted to those moves by building bamboo structures that police dismantled, and later moved into an underpass that police on Wednesday cleared them out of forcefully.

Public anger over the aggressive tactics used by police Wednesday night erupted after local TV showed officers taking a protester around a dark corner and kicking him repeatedly on the ground.

It's unclear what provoked the attack. Local Now TV showed him splashing water on officers beforehand.

Ken Tsang said he was kicked while he was 'detained and defenseless.' He added that he was assaulted again in the police station afterward.

Tsang, a member of a pro-democracy political party, lifted his shirt to show reporters injuries to his torso and said he is considering legal action against police.

Police spokesman Steve Hui said seven officers who were involved have been temporarily reassigned, and that authorities will carry out an impartial investigation.

The occupy campsite: Despite attempts by police to chip away at the camp, their violent actions over the past couple of days seem only to have galvanised support for Hong Kong's Occupy Central movement

A protester takes a rest in his tent. The protests are the biggest since China took over Hong Kong in 1997

The demonstrators have taken to the streets since September 26 to oppose the Chinese central government's decision to screen candidates to run in the territory's first direct elections in 2017

They also want the territory's leader who was picked by Beijing, Chief Executive Leung Chan-ying, to resign

Several hundred people turned up at Hong Kong police headquarters on Wednesday night for a protest organised by a social workers' union over the treatment of Mr Tsang, who is a social worker.

They lined up to file individual complaints about the beating.

'He was handcuffed already, he was not able to resist but still he was beaten,' said Maggie Yuen, one of the protesters. 'I don't see any explanation other than that the police abuse their authority.'

The demonstrators have taken to the streets since September 26 to oppose the Chinese central government's decision to screen candidates to run in the territory's first direct elections in 2017.

They also want the territory's unpopular leader who was picked by Beijing, Chief Executive Leung Chan-ying, to resign.

China's central government is becoming increasingly impatient with the mostly peaceful protests, the biggest challenge to its authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997.

There were no signs, however, that Beijing was planning to become directly involved in suppressing them.
