A woman found padlocked in an apartment said the boyfriend accused of keeping her there for years is 'a good man' who has never abused her.

Nancy Rodriguez Duran, 44, said the kidnapping case against 42-year-old Michael Mendez is a lie and that she asked him to padlock the bedroom door with her inside.

Duran claimed Mendez was going out and she was worried about maintenance workers coming into their Paterson, New Jersey apartment and seeing her in a nightgown.

Denial: Nancy Rodriguez Duran says the kidnapping case against her boyfriend Michael Mendez, left, is a lie

She asked her boyfriend, 41, to padlock the bedroom door

The woman, who appeared in court to support her boyfriend on Tuesday, claimed that maintenance workers at the apartment block continually let themselves into the couple's apartment without permission.

A narcotics squad on a drugs bust 
found the woman locked in a room where they believe she may have been
kept for up to ten years.

The third-floor apartment of Michael Mendez, 41, was being searched because he has strong links to the violent Latin Kings street gang.

A police spokesman told MailOnline that based on evidence at the scene, detectives believed that the woman had been locked in the room on and off for at least two years -  and potentially up to a decade.

Investigators said the woman led them to believe she had been held captive - which she denied today.

Rodriguez Duran told NJ.com: 'Everything is a lie. I told him to do it for that day.'

The
highly organized street gang is known for prolific drug trafficking and violence.

Founded in the 1940s by Puerto Ricans, it is now mostly made up of Mexican members. There is believed to be 160 chapters in the U.S. with  20 - 35,000 members.

Many groups have bolstered ties with Mexican cartels to tighten their grip on the U.S. drug market.

Primary sources of income include street dealing of cocaine, heroin and marijuana.

The gang's colours are black/gold with tattoos and graffiti consisting of five or three-point crowns.

Last year, 15 gang members or associates of the Latin Kings - including two Chicago police officers - were indicted in an alleged racketeering conspiracy that resulted in 19 murders.

Mendez was charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and other counts related to drugs.

He pleaded not guilty in court today and remains held on $1 million bail.

There was a bucket in the room as a chamber pot, according to NBC New York and Mendez allowed his victim access to a TV. 

One neighbor at the brick 
building on Alois Place said he had known Mendez for around 12 years and
that Mendez would hang out in the communal areas of the apartment 
complex.

He said he had seen the woman a few times in the past although it was rare.

The man, who refused to give his name 
because of worries over safety, said he remembered seeing the woman get 
into a car a few times.

A maintenance worker, who also declined to give his name because of concerns over his safety, remembered the woman 'cussing me out one time when I was doing my work'.

Neighbors on either side of Mendez's top-floor apartment said they weren't aware that another person lived in the apartment.

'I didn't see any woman,' said a man who identified himself only as Buddy and opened his door only a few inches as he spoke.

'This is the first I'm hearing of it.'

Mendez, whom police said has strong gang ties, was being held at Passaic County Jail.

The
Latin Kings is a violent street gang who have been previously been 
investigated by the FBI for drug trafficking, weapons and racketeering.

State
police said they found 4,200 prescription pills valued at $100,000, 190
grams of marijuana valued at nearly $2,000 and nearly $23,000 in cash 
inside Mendez's apartment.

According to court records, Mendez has two prior convictions for aggravated assault, one of which carried a three-month jail term.
