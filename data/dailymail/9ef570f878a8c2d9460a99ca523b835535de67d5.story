Brazilian midfielder Bernard has failed to recover from an ankle injury and will miss Shakhtar Donetsk's last 16 Champions League game with Bayern Munich on Tuesday.

Bernard is currently recovering from inflammation of the ankle ligaments and did not travel to Lviv with the Shakhtar squad.

'Bernard is suffering from the inflammation of ligaments caused by workloads. But nothing serious, no surgery required,' club's doctor Artur Glushchenko told the channel's website.
