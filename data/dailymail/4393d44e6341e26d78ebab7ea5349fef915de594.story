Joe Hart needs to have an outstanding World Cup to be rated alongside Italy counterpart Gianluigi Buffon as one of the planet's best goalkeepers, according to Peter Shilton.

The former Three Lions keeper believes current No 1 Hart is yet to prove himself at the highest level, despite Wayne Rooney and Arsenal's Wojciech Szczesny claiming that the Manchester City man is the already the most talented stopper in world football.

Shilton concedes that the 27-year-old is full of natural ability, but insists he must enjoy a strong tournament for Roy Hodgson's side in Brazil in order to move to the next level.

Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, Shilton said: 'The World Cup will be his acid test. If he has a tremendous tournament then he'll be rated as one of the best in the world but he's still got it all to do.

'Some players have described him as the best in the world but that's premature. He proved he's still got a lot to learn after his problems at Manchester City last season.

'He's got a lot of natural ability but there's still plenty for him to work on and improve.'

Hart came under criticism for his club performances during the opening months of last season and was subsequently dropped for seven consecutive Premier League games by boss Manuel Pellegrini.

He regained his place in the starting XI in December and played every remaining game as City overcame Liverpool and Chelsea to win their second league title in three years.

Despite Hart's upturn in form in the latter stages of last season, England's most capped player admits to being surprised by the number of high-profile mistakes made by the former Shrewsbury starlet.

Shilton said: 'It really surprised me when he lost his 
form earlier in the season.Â

'That never happened to me. I didn't ever 
have a really bad spell. I had a game I wanted to forget on the odd 
occasion, but never more than that.

'He's
 a confident guy and that helps seep into the defence. But at the same 
time, he knows that one mistake could live with him for the rest of his 
life. We've seen it before with David Seaman, Peter Bonetti and Rob 
Green.

'Joe is still young and this is a big opportunity for him. His reputation will improve if he has a good tournament.'

Hart will come up against Mario Balotelli and Italy in the heat of Manaus on Saturday as England kick-off their Group D campaign against the team who eliminated them from Euro 2012 on penalties.

And while 
Hart will be focusing on the attacking talent at the disposal of Cesare 
Prandelli, Shilton believes he should be aiming emulate the man in 
between the sticks at the opposite end.

Asked
 who the best goalkeeper on show will be at the World Cup, the 
ex-Leicester and Nottingham Forest keeper doesn't hesitate. 'Gianluigi 
Buffon,' he replies immediately.

Super stopper: Gianluigi Buffon (centre) is the No 1 keeper in world football, according to Shilton

Eye on the ball: Buffon is set to line up opposite Hart in Manaus on Saturday night

'He has always been a very solid goalkeeper technically and he's capable of making great saves. He's obviously not getting any younger, but he'll be very difficult to beat when England play Italy.'

Shilton also rates Spain's Iker Casillas highly and picks out Germany's Manuel Neuer as one to watch too. But neither are given the same praise as the Juventus legend.

If he finds his best form Brazil, Hart might just have a chance of joining Buffon in Shilton's - and many other people's - list of greats.
