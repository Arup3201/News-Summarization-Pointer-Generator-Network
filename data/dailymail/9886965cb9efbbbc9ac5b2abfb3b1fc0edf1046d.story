Carl Lewis, the nine-time Olympic gold medal winner in track and field who once set world records for sprinting, said Monday that New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie tripped him up in 2011 he tried a run of a different kind – for political office.

Current Lieutenant Gov. Kim Guadagno, then the state's attorney general, ruled that Lewis hadn't lived in the Garden State long enough to run for a seat in the state senate.

He was preparing to run as a Democrat against Republican state Sen. Dawn Addiego, a Christie friend and ally.

The story of Lewis' frustrating political hurdle is well-known in New Jersey, but he claimed Monday that Christie tried to force him out of the race by threatening to scuttle his role as the state's first physical fitness ambassador – a move he later made when Lewis took Guadagno to court.

'I felt like he was trying to intimidate me, absolutely,' the legendary athlete told the Star-Ledger in Newark.

'But I definitely didn’t feel intimidated.'

Carl Lewis won 9 gold medals as a track and field athlete, and was best-known as a sprinter and long-jumper, but he allegedly found his political aspirations squashed when he tried to unseat a Christie chum

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has faced complaints about his bullying government style as the 2016 presidential circus approaches

'It's interesting, everyone calling him a bully,' Lewis said. 'I don't really see him as a bully. I see it more as someone who's insecure, and he's governor now and has got the power.'

An administrative law judge originally sided with Lewis, saying he met the requirements for putting his name on the ballot since he grew up in the new Jersey township of Willingboro.

But Guadagno personally overturned that ruling, based on the fact that he had voted in California two years earlier.

Christie and Guadagno have both attracted new claims of partisan bullying in recent weeks from adversaries.

Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, has speculated that Christie presided over a politically motivated closure of highway lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as part of a retribution scheme against him after he declined to endorse Christie's re-election.

That scandal has already led to the resignation of two Christie appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the firing of two Christie aides.

And Dawn Zimmer, the mayor of Hoboken, claims Guadagno carried a message to her from Christie, saying he would hold her city's Hurricane Sandy relief money hostage unless she approved a commercial development plan he favored.

Christie has looked haggard in recent days, as pressure mounts over his administration's handling of several new scandals

Guadagno has categorically denied the allegation, but Zimmer has shared notes from her journal with a federal prosecutor who is already investigating Christie over what has become known as 'Bridgegate.'

Lewis' almost-appointment as New Jersey's youth fitness czar, he said at the time, turned sour after he pressed forward with his bid to unseat Addiego, the governor's friend.

'I thought it was going just fine,' as Lewis  recalled for the Star-Ledger. 'And when I started to run, when he talked to me on the phone that night, he said "If you run, we're going to have to cancel the program".'

The Christie administration ultimately spent $78,000 in attorney staffers' time to remove Lewis from the ballot, according to public records.

But at the time, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak insisted that the governor never triedto step between Lewis and any political finish line.

'Absolutely, positively not. And anybody who says otherwise is lying,' he said then, although he did say Christie told Lewis that he needed to support his long-time friend.

Drewniak, like 17 other officials, is under subpoena in connection with Bridgegate.
