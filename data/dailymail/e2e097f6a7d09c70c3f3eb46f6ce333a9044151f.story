It became a symbol of Russia’s struggle against the German bombings of the Second World War.

But now - almost four decades after Dmitri Shostakovich died - his Symphony No. 7 is back in the public eye after its incorporation into a chart song was nominated for an Ivor Novello award.

Ill Manors by Plan B has been shortlisted for Best Contemporary Song at the prestigious awards and will compete against Fitzpleasure by Mercury Prize winners Alt-J and Pelican by The Maccabees.

Plan B - stage name of rapper Ben Drew - wrote the song in response to the London 2011 riots and featured a sample of the fourth movement of Shostakovich’s symphony, reported The Independent.

The Russian composer’s work was first performed in 1942 and dedicated to Leningrad’s citizens. In the Novellos, he was credited in Plan B’s song as a co-songwriter of the hit, along with four others.

Pianist Shostakovich died in 1975 and was one of the most popular composers of the 20th century.

He composed his first symphony aged 19, but in 1936 Joseph Stalin was dismayed by a performance of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District - and state media slammed the ‘bedlam of noise’.

However Shostakovich then produced his Fifth Symphony, which was a hit with Soviet dictator Stalin thanks to its message of victory emerging from adversity - and he became a musical hero.

Triumphant year: Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sande, 26, was nominated in both the best song and a most performed work category in the Novellos

Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sande, 26, was nominated in both the best song and a most performed work category in the Novellos.

It has been a triumphant 12 months for Sande, who won best British female artist and best album at the BRIT Awards and sang at the opening and closing ceremonies of the London 2012 Olympics.

Leeds-based indie rock quartet Alt-J were also nominated for the album award for An Awesome Wave, while Plan B's Ill Manors was also up for best original film score.

The 58th Ivor Novello Awards, to be presented on May 16, are judged by the music writing community and are regarded as the most important awards for British music writers.
