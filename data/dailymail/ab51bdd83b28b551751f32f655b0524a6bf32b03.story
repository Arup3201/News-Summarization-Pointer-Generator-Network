A stage four breast cancer patient had her radiation treatment cancelled yesterday because of a football game. 

The woman's friend Kathleen Keating, told the Charlotte Observer that her friend was informed on Wednesday that her treatment for Thursday was cancelled due to the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill football game against the University of Miami.

According to UNC Health Care spokesman Karen McCall, the clinic had planned months ahead for the Thursday game and avoided scheduling anyone past 3:30pm because of traffic. Ms McCall said that any last minute rescheduling probably resulted from factors not related to the game.

Postponed: A stage four cancer patient's radiation treatment was cancelled on Thursday due to a University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill football game against the University of Miami

'I think it's criminal,' Keating told the Observer. 'I like football but it's not even an equation you need to do in your head. Football versus cancer treatment? It's not just a question.'

Ms Keating's friend was too sick to be interviewed and is in 'considerable pain'. 

'The system should not be doing this to people with cancer,' Ms Keating said. 'It's just wrong.'

The radiation oncology clinics addressed the issue of the Thursday scheduling by opening up Saturday treatments. Doctors determined who could wait 'without harming their care'.

'So it was a decision that was made by the providers,' said Dr Shelley Earp, director of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. 'Some of those people are going to have their therapy on Saturday. Some may not. It may not make a difference whether they have it every day...It was a considered decision.'

A spokesman for UNC Health Care said that the clinic had planned for the Thursday game months ahead and purposefully didn't schedule anyone after 3:30pm because of traffic. Additional appointments were rescheduled for Saturday

But Dr Earp also pointed out the importance of the school's football culture in making university's health care center one of the best in the nation. 

'We are who we are because of the university,' Dr Earp said. 'We are able to attract 300 world-class faculty who want to be in a university town. They could be anyplace in America, because they're that quality.'

Mid-week games are also very rare. Yesterday's game was only the second Thursday football game in the school's history.
