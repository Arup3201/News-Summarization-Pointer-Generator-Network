The 57-year-old carpenter whose naked body was found strapped to a chair in a Gold Coast residence last month allegedly died after a wild sex romp with a prostitute, in which he was gagged with a sock and punctured with what may have been the woman's stiletto heel.

Police allege the prostitute and her driver planned to rob Gregory John Hudson after she saw cash and drugs at his address during a kinky sexual encounter with him the day after he arrived in Queensland from Sydney,the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.

Police at first believed Mr Hudson may have died in a sex game gone wrong after a female flatmate found his naked body inside a town house at Varsity Lakes, a southern Gold Coast suburb, on October 23.

His hands had been bound and a sock, believed to have been used as a gag, was beside him. Puncture wounds found on his body were consistent with having been inflicted by the heel of a stiletto shoe.
