Caught on camera: Great British Bake Off runner-up James Morton (left) joked on Twitter after he was spotted carrying a Greggs bag

His elaborate creations endeared him to the nation – and to the judges.

But now the Great British Bake Off is over, even James Morton can’t be crafting homemade delicacies every day.

Instead, he popped into a Greggs bakery in Glasgow for a rather more ordinary treat: a yum yum.

The 21-year-old medical student was a runner-up on the show, having impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with his quirky concoctions, including a choux pastry bicycle, derelict gingerbread house and a parsnip upside-down cake.

Mr Morton, affectionately known as ‘the hunk in the tank top’ because of his penchant for Fair Isle knitwear, joked about his snack on Twitter after being spotted by a photographer.

He wrote: ‘Just been papped with a Greggs bag in my hand #CareerOver’. In reply to another Twitter user, he added: ‘It’s a yum yum. Most acceptable Greggs treat.’

A spokesman for Greggs replied on Twitter, saying: ‘We can’t all live on pastry bicycles.’

Mr Morton, who confessed he put on two stone during filming, has returned to Glasgow to resume his studies.

He made it to the final three in the hugely popular BBC2 series, competing against Brendan Lynch, 63, and law graduate John Whaite, 23.

Six million viewers watched as Mr Whaite was crowned the surprise winner.

Mr Morton started baking with his grandmother as a young boy.

He is from Hillswick in Shetland and is the son of the Scottish broadcaster, writer and musician Tom Morton.

Mr Morton confessed he put on 2st in weight during the making of the Great British Bake Off.

Regulars at the Peerie Shop Café in Lerwick, Scotland, have been enjoying Mr Morton’s creations for quite a while.

During the long summer break he tested out his baking skills on customers including parsnip cakes and lavender and apple tarte tatin.

A colleague at the café said: ‘We have had a lot of people come in just to see him.

‘They love it - he’s had to sign autographs and customers want to have their photographs taken with him.

‘Each week he bakes the cakes and tarts he has made on the show and they have sold really well.

‘The first thing he made on the show - the parsnip, pecan and pear upside-down cake - was the bestseller.’
