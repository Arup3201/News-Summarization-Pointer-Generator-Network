It's a source of sadness to grandparents everywhere – their teenage grandchildren don't spend enough time with them.

And it appears that even fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, 73, isn't immune.

Dame Vivienne – once the first lady of punk – said she was disappointed that her 17-year-old granddaughter Cora Corré had failed to call or see her.

She said Miss Corré had missed her fashion show at the weekend so she could go on a skiing holiday instead.

Asked about the young model, who made her London Fashion Week debut last year, Miss Westwood revealed Miss Corré had not 'kept in touch'.

She added: 'I am very disappointed. I think she is wasting her opportunity. She should use me. I'll be dead and she will think, 'What was that woman talking about?'

It is not the first time Dame Vivienne has publicly criticised her granddaughter.

In an interview recently she said: 'She's a beautiful girl, but I wish she would use it to stand for something. I would also like to see more of her. She's teenager, she's busy.'

And she said she hoped her granddaughter would ask to read her diary.

She said: 'I think my diary is a point of view you wouldn't get anywhere else. I am trying to understand the world we live in. I think she could get a lot from it.'

Miss Corré is the child of Agent Provocateur founders Joe Corré, Dame Vivienne's son with the late Malcolm McLaren, and his ex-wife Serena Rees.

The couple sold the lingerie chain following their divorce in 2007.

Miss Corré, who went to the progressive boarding school Bedales with fellow model Cara Delevingne, made her catwalk debut aged just four in one of her grandmother's fashion shows.

She was signed by Next Models last summer, and in September she took a bow with Dame Vivienne at the close of her grandmother's Red Label show.
