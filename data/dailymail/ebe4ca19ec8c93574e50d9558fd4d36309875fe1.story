DNA test results today confirmed a baby boy who disappeared eight years ago is the child of the couple who reported him missing, but doubts have now been raised as to whether or not they gave the boy away with their other children.

Fernando Morin and Auboni Champion-Morin, from Houston, Texas, are seeking to regain custody of the child, Miguel, who's been in foster care since last week.

They declined to answer questions about why their other four children are no longer in their custody and haven't been for years, but said they wanted to focus on Miguel

A woman described by officials as the child's godmother and former neighbor, Krystle Tanner, is jailed in San Augustine in East Texas for his alleged kidnapping but officials are trying to discern whether or not her was given up.

Tanner faces a kidnapping charge related to the child's disappearance in late 2004, when he was eight-months-old.

State District Judge Mike Schneider, 
who ordered the DNA testing at an emergency custody hearing last week, 
is set to hold another hearing in the case next week.

Child welfare officials last week 
said Morin and Champion-Morin, both 29, were uncooperative with 
investigators when the boy initially was reported missing. The parents 
deny the allegations.

Another couple told Houston 
television station KHOU on Tuesday that they've been caring for the four
other Morin children, who are between the ages of seven and 14.

They said Champion-Morin gave the children to them years ago and that they are the legal guardians.

Champion-Morin, emerging from a 
courtroom on Wednesday, wouldn't discuss the TV station report: 'Right 
now, everything's a private matter. I'm not going there right now with 
any of the news.'

Suspicions: Questions are being asked about whether or not the Morins have their son up or if he was kidnapped from them by his godmother

Child Protective Services spokeswoman
Gwen Carter said the situation involving the other children is part of 
the child welfare agency's investigation into the outcome of Miguel's 
custody.

'In regard to the other children, 
there's no current concern about their safety and well-being,' Carter 
said. 'But in the normal course of investigating, we talk to siblings to
find out what may be going on.'

Last week, Champion-Morin implied her
four children were at home and looking forward to becoming acquainted 
with their long-missing brother.

She said she and the children would celebrate Miguel's birthday each year and pray for his safe return.

Officials have disclosed in court that Miguel, in interviews with child welfare authorities, said his name was Jaquan.

They said the eight-year-old didn't 
know his last name, thought he was 6 years old and identified Tanner as 
his mother when shown a picture of her.

The officials described the boy as 
well-mannered and said he told them he attended school but couldn't read
and couldn't name his teacher or any classmates. They said there was no
evidence he was enrolled in school.

CPS spokeswoman: Estella Olguin spoke to the media to confirm that Mr Morin was the biological father of the boy

The long-dormant case got new life last summer when Tanner took the boy to a hospital for treatment of a leg injury.

When she couldn't provide his name or
a Social Security number, hospital staff became concerned and contacted
child welfare investigators who eventually were able to link Tanner to 
the 2004 Houston case.

Tanner was arrested March 12. Her 
sister, after seeing reports about the arrest, called police the next 
day and offered to turn over the child she believed was Tanner's 
stepson.

Gary Cunningham, chief deputy for the
San Augustine County Sheriff's Department, said Wednesday the case 
remained under investigation and that Tanner, who was being held without
bond, was not available for interviews with reporters.
