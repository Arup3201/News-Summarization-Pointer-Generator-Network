Serena Williams cruised into the third round of the Miami Open on Saturday with a comfortable victory over Monica Niculescu.

The two players had failed to get on court on Friday due to the weather but the delay did not distract the top seed and she claimed a 6-3, 6-1 victory to set up a clash with 15-year-old CiCi Bellis.

Williams had withdrawn from the semi-finals of the BNP Paribas Open last week with a knee injury but insisted her fitness was not a concern.

'It was a little sore in practice, but it was okay today,' she told www.wtatennis.com. 'I really didn't feel it to be honest. On the court you have so much adrenaline going, and the adrenaline kind of kills it.

'So I was surprised. I felt pretty good.'

Sixth seed Eugenie Bouchard was also playing catch up after the weather and she made a shock exit as she lost 6-0, 7-6 (7/4) to qualifier Tatjana Maria.

In the remaining second round matches to be completed, Sara Errani beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-1, 7-6 (7/5) and Angelique Kerber was a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 winner over Heather Watson.
