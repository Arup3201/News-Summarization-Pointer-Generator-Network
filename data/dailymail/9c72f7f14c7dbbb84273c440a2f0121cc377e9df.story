Move over Rita Ora, put down your microphone Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, because there's a new Briish pop star making big waves in the music industry... and she's only eleven years old.

Sophia Grace Brownlee from Essex first found fame in 2011 after posting a video of herself and her cousin Rosie McClelland performing Nicki Minaj's Superbass on Youtube.

The clip was spotted by Ellen DeGeneres, who invited them onto her TV show to perform and they proved so popular with audiences that the comedian dedicated a section of her programme to the girls. 

Sophia Grace, 11, has since gone solo and is now releasing her second single, titled 'Best Friends', which has already been viewed by more than six million people on Youtube.

The music career follows a hugely successful few years for the youngsters, also have their own book line and a set of dolls.

Sophia told BBC Newsbeat of her rise to fame: 'I used to sing from when I was really young and all my family used to say, 'oh you're really good you should put yourself on Youtube.' 

Describing her new track, she said: 'It's about girls getting together and having a sleep over and just having nice friends who are loyal.'

Sophia and her cousin Rosie were plucked from obscurity when Ellen  saw a video of the pair and invited them over to the States.

Not only did they end up performing on her show on several occasions, but Ellen also employed the girls to do red carpet interviews for her. 

A film deal followed, with the pair shooting Sophia Grace and Rosie's Royal Adventure in Cape Town, South Africa. 

Sophia Grace in particular has been praised for her singing talents and in 2013 released a single called Girls Just Gotta Have Fun.

To date, the video has been viewed more than 62 million times - that's five million more times than Cheryl's Fight For This Love, which was released four years earlier.

He new single Best Friends has already made it into the Billboards Charts at No.87 and is expected to rise much higher as the week goes on. 

There are already discussions taking place her to record an album within the next 12 months. 

A source close to the young star said: 'Girls Just Gotta Have Fun was a fun track but Best Friends is really getting everyone excited.

'There's been a lot of interest from music industry big wigs and everyone is saying that she is moving in the right direction for a big career.'

Indeed, when the Best Friends video went out Katy Perry not only tweeted about it, she even said she wanted to be on the remix.  

In 2012, the girls got to meet Justin Bieber and his on / off girlfriend took a picture of them with the star

If her latest successes are anything to go by she could be set to be one of Britain's biggest exports and part of the new generation of stars that make their name from YouTube, much like vloggers Zoella and Alfie Deyes.

Having already met and interviewed the likes of Taylor Swift, Hugh Grant, Justin Bieber and Reese Witherspoon on the Ellen Show, it's likely she'll have some famous friends to support her.

And when she's done with singing Sophia hopes to conquer the acting world. 

She told Billboard of her future plans: 'I'm going to carry on recording songs: 'I also love acting so much, so I hope to do more of that very soon.'
