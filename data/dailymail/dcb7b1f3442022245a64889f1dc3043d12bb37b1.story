The bizarre decision to stage 2015 Rugby World Cup matches at Leicester’s football ground rather than Welford Road is demonstrated by the rugby club’s plans when the three group games are played.

Leicester Tigers will be putting on their normal pre-match entertainment at Welford Road - just a short walk from the King Power Stadium - and giving their fans the chance to watch the games on big screens.

This follows the demand by Tigers supporters to savour the World Cup on rugby premises rather than live at the football ground, where none of the matches have yet sold out. Welford Road cannot be used to host games because the International Rugby Board say the width of the pitch is two metres too short.

Tigers chief executive Simon Cohen said: ‘There’s no doubt our fans would much prefer to watch World Cup rugby at Welford Road rather than the football ground and we are planning accordingly.’

Leicester Tigers' Welford Road Stadium will still be used to show the match on big screens, however

lan Condron, Sky Sports' experienced producer of Soccer Saturday, was responsible for the decision to clarify on-air pundit Charlie Nicholas’ comment that he could not quickly distinguish between black Manchester City players Fernando and Fernandinho.

It’s a sign of these politically correct times that Sky felt it necessary to explain Nicholas’ comment - knowing they would be damned if they did or didn’t. Nicholas also pointedly apologised to anyone offended by his remark rather than the words themselves. 

The last time Sky made such a high-profile apology came after cricket pundit Andrew Strauss described Kevin Pietersen as a ‘total c***’ believing he was off air. This was a rather more obvious decision to make than the Nicholas one.

Mike Riley, beleaguered general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials who has predecessor Keith Hackett leading the calls for his head, has nevertheless had his job security strengthened by joining the PGMO board of directors.

Hackett was never invited on to the board and his criticisms of Riley have infuriated football’s top brass, who know that Hackett would have hated it if Riley had given him similar treatment.

Meanwhile, Keren Barratt, select group manager who decides the referees’ match rota, retires this season with technical director Howard Webb expected to take over.

FA chairman Greg Dyke, whose many other roles limit the time he can spend at Wembley, will have to reschedule his workload to help fill a leadership void.

General secretary Alex Horne leaves at the end of January and the job application period for his successor only closed at the end of last week.

It is likely that it will be another month for an appointment to be made and then notice periods will have to be served - leaving Dyke with no choice but to take on more duties himself, although his contract is for two days a week.

Gower in Lord’s U-turn

Former England captain David Gower is now strongly aligned with the MCC faction wanting Lord’s building plans aborted in favour of Nursery End property development funding renovations.

Sky cricket host Gower, who initially backed the rebels before changing his mind in favour of the committee’s piecemeal renovation, has now put his name, along with Lord Grabiner and other grandee members, to a resolution seeking an independent assessment of all Lord’s development and funding options.

Gower said: ‘I’m very much in favour of MCC re-considering taking the money for an appropriate smaller scale property development for the long-term financial health of the club. The Nursery End is enclosed by what looks like a prison wall. Lord’s still has its own mystique, but there’s certainly more of a wow factor on the approaches to the Melbourne or Sydney grounds.

‘The club are using debentures’ sales in members’ enclosures to pay for the new Warner Stand and they haven’t the cash reserves to pay for all their other planned renovations. So they shouldn’t turn a blind eye to alternative options by attempting to have only those who agree with them on the management committee. That’s just incompetence.’

An MCC spokesman said: ‘We have proper funding plans and are making great progress.’
