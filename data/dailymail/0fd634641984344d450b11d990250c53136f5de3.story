Forty-one Scottish Terriers became the unlikely stars of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony.

The Scotties were the highlight of the show for many of the millions watching at home, as social media sites were flooded with praise for the animals.

It is the first time dogs have been used to lead in the teams.

The dogs were walked around the Celtic Park stadium on leads - each labelled with the team it was representing.

Some made the walk round the stadium twice with different teams. Some, their little legs too tired to make walk, were carried by their owners.

Others appears to bound along to the music, wagging their tails.

The owner of the ‘Canada’ dog waved the animals’ little paw, to the delight of the crowd.

Dale Bray tweeted: ‘The little Scottish Terriers make it completely worthwhile to sit through the #commonwealthgames opening ceremony.’

Another said: ‘These Scottish Terriers walking each team in are EVERYTHING. Best addition to the Commonwealth Games!’.

Casting directors had scoured Scotland for 41 Scottish Terriers – and found the last one just four weeks ago.

Thirty of the dogs walked around the stadium twice in order to lead out all 71 nations and territories taking part, resulting in a quick five-minute costume change mid-ceremony.

The dogs wore a maroon check coat bearing the name of their designated nation, while their owners wore matching wool trousers and skirts.

They had been recruited from dog groomers and Scottish Terrier groups, in secret, so as not to ruin the surprise for the global audience.
