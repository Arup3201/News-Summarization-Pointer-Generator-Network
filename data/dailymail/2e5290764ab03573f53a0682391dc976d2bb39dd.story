A mother-of-one was in jail today after being charged with the first-degree murder of her husband who was found with fatal gunshot wounds at the family home.

Rebekah Mellon, 31, called police on Tuesday night who arrived at the scene to find her husband bleeding heavily from gunshot wounds.Â 

Emergency crews performed CPR on Donald Mellon, 46, who was taken to hospital in Phoenix, Arizona but later died.

Police said Mellon was 'uncooperative' and refused to answer questions over the death of her husband of seven years, according to ABC.

After working through the night, detectives had gathered enough evidence to arrest Mellon for murder after she continued to change her story about what had happened at the couple's home.

Mellon was pictured being led into the police station in handcuffs and overalls but kept her head down and said nothing. It was unclear whether she had hired an attorney.

Mellon has an 11-year-old son who is 
not related to the victim. Moments before the gunshots rang out, the boy
had left the house to go to a sleepover.

He was now in the custody of his grandmother.
