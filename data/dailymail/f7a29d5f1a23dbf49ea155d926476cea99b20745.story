Alan Watts, 65, (pictured outside Luton Crown Court) is on trial for the manslaughter of 64-year-old Brian Holmes after an alleged row in an Asda car park

A motorist killed a cancer survivor in a ‘moment of madness’ in a row over a disabled parking space, a jury heard.

Alan Watts, 65, sarcastically shouted, ‘you look like you need a wheelchair’ when he saw Brian Holmes, 64, putting shopping in his car boot.

He is accused of getting out of his Range Rover and lashing out with a ‘right-left combination’ in a show of ‘extraordinary violence’.

Mr Holmes, who had been given the all-clear from cancer just days earlier, hit his head on the ground and died the next day in hospital.

Prosecutor Ann Evans said Watts struck out in an ‘unprovoked violent outburst’.

She said: ‘This is a case about how a moment of madness can change people’s lives for ever.

The defendant, in a show of extraordinary violence, lashed out at Brian Holmes at a car park in Asda and killed him with a punch to the head.’

The jury was shown CCTV footage of the clash in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, in August.

Luton Crown Court heard yesterday that Watts goaded his victim after seeing his car parked in a disabled space and blocked him in with his four-wheel drive.

He admitted to police that he leaned out of the window and made the sarcastic comment but claims he struck out in self-defence.

Mrs Evans said Mr Holmes was placing 
shopping from a nearby market in the car while his wife Christine went 
ahead to the supermarket.

Mrs Holmes, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, was the holder of a 
blue disabled parking badge. ‘That was the last time she saw him 
conscious and uninjured,’ Mrs Evans said.

The camera filmed Watts punching his victim twice before he fell to the ground. He then drove away.

Mrs
Evans said: ‘Within seconds Mr Holmes moves backwards away from the 
door and Mr Watts gets out. Mr Holmes then backs away and Mr Watts walks
towards him closing the car door behind him.’

The court heard that just days before the alleged incident, Mr Holmes (left) had been told he had beaten cancer. Watts has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter, saying he acted in self-defence after Mr Holmes 'attacked him'

She added: ‘Mr Watts raises his right arm and his torso twists, consistent with striking his right hand at Mr Holmes.

‘Mr Watts immediately raises his left arm, his torso twists again and the arm moves. Again consistent, you may conclude, with a right-left combination punch to Mr Holmes’ face. Mr Holmes immediately falls to the ground.’

Witnesses described seeing the defendant with clenched fists approaching his victim who tried to defend himself from the blows.

Mr Holmes, a grandfather, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, was airlifted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, where he died on August 4.

But Crown prosecutor Ann Evans told the court during her opening address that Watts goaded Mr Holmes after seeing his car was parked in a disabled spot in the Asda car park before setting on him in an unprovoked attack

When Watts was arrested later that day, he told officers: ‘I can still hear it now – the man banged his head something chronic on the floor.’

He told police he acted in self-defence because Mr Holmes had tried to pull him out of his car and had grabbed his wrists. He claimed his victim was ‘effing and blinding’ and he suspected he was drunk.

Mrs Evans said he told police he left immediately because he wanted to get his wife home and ‘didn’t know whether he was going to be attacked again’.

But she said the jury must decide whether it was reasonable to believe Mr Holmes was the aggressor. ‘Here is Mr Holmes, a man who was recently given the all-clear from cancer,’ she said. ‘Does he, as Mr Watts suggests, lose it?’

Watts, of Biggleswade, denies manslaughter, claiming he was acting in self-defence.

The trial continues.
