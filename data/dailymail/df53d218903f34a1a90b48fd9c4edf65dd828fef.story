With travel firms jacking up prices during school holidays, many parents have been tempted to take their children abroad in term time instead.

The education authorities frown on such behaviour. But now one school governor has broken ranks.

Paul Lawton ignored anti-truanting laws to take his 13-year old daughter Lucie-Ann out of school for 11 days so they could enjoy a fortnight in Spain.

Some parents at the Macclesfield Academy in Cheshire, where Mr Lawton sits on the governing body, were outraged

Other parents have accused him of 
setting a bad example but Mr Lawton, a farmer, said he was too busy with
 work in the summer months, and had also wanted his daughter to visit 
her godfather, who has cancer.

The father of five added that he had saved £5,000 on the break on the Costa del Sol by going during term time.

Mr
 Lawton, 42, said: ‘To go when we did cost us £1,200 to fly the whole 
family of seven to Spain with flights and transfers.

The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school.

It equates to £60 per child, rising to £120 if it's not paid within 21 days.

After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court.

Parents are prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act.

'If we had gone 
three weeks later it would have been £6,000 and we can’t afford that.

‘I
 think the Government should stop this ridiculous rip-off.

'Some people 
aren’t fortunate enough to be able to spend £5,000 to go away for two 
weeks.

‘When I see the prices before and after the school holidays, I’m annoyed. It makes it impossible to go and explore Europe.’

But
 some parents at the 800-pupil Macclesfield Academy in Cheshire, where 
Mr Lawton is a governor, were outraged after holiday photos emerged of 
the family at the resort.

One
 said: ‘Parents are constantly bleated at about taking their kids out of
 school to go on holidays and he of all people should know about that.

‘Even
 though we are left virtually broke due to the hike in holiday prices 
during non-term time, most of us toe the line because we don’t want to 
get into any trouble. What he’s done has made a mockery of the school.’

Fined: Natasha and Stewart Sutherland pictured arriving at Telford Magistrates Court. They were fined £630 and ordered to pay £300

Earlier this month a couple were hit with a £1,000 penalty for taking their three children out of school for a foreign holiday.

Stewart and Natasha Sutherland fell foul of a new law allowing councils to fine parents who fail to ensure their children attend class.

They returned home from the week-long break to Rhodes – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £360. This was soon doubled to £720 because they did not pay up quickly enough, as well as £300 costs and a £63 victim surcharge.Education Act, subsections one and eight.

Speaking after the case, Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said the week in question was the only one he and his wife could both take off work.

‘We had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars,’ added the 39-year-old.

‘Surely that would make our children’s education suffer more than a much-needed holiday? I can’t see the justice in it at all.

When
 Mr Lawton returned from Spain his own school requested that he and his 
wife Emma, 33, be issued with a fixed penalty notice of £60 each by the 
local education authority under anti-truanting laws.

They
 did not pay and were taken before magistrates where they both admitted a
 charge of failing to ensure their child attended school and were each 
fined £120 with £50 costs and £20 victim surcharge.

Cheshire
 East Council said the schoolgirl was absent without proper authority 
over 11 morning and 11 afternoon sessions between July 9 and 22 last 
year.

Mr Lawton told the magistrates: ‘We went to see my foster father 
who has cancer and whose health is only expected to deteriorate.

'We 
could ill afford to go, but my daughter is his goddaughter and he wanted
 to see her.’

But magistrate David Coulston told him: ‘As a governor, you should have known better of the protocols of the school.’

Yesterday
 Mrs Lawton said the holiday had been their first since the couple’s 
honeymoon in Egypt.

Her husband said he believed he was being singled 
out because he was a governor, adding: ‘When I booked the holiday I 
wasn’t a governor. I didn’t come on board until May 2013 and booked the 
holiday in 2012.’

Macclesfield
 Academy headmaster Richard Hedge said fixed penalty notices were issued
 by the council when pupils missed five days or more.

He added: ‘We 
would not make special allowance for a governor or for anybody else.’

George Wilson, chairman of governors, said a decision on any action would be made after a meeting next month.

A survey for yesterday’s Daily Mail showed that some holidays will more than double in price during half-term next month.

 also reported the case of Paul Cookson, 41, from Devon, whose complaint
 about the rising cost of a planned Center Parcs holiday with his 
daughter, seven, was shared 143,000 times by other parents.
