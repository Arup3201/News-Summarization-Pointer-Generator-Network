Tragic: Former Sale Sharks rugby union player David Tait has died after falling from an apartment block in Hong Kong

Former international rugby player David Tait has died  after falling from an apartment block in Hong Kong.

The 25-year-old's body was found yesterday morning and in a brief statement, his family said they were devastated.

Originally from Sale, Greater Manchester, Mr Tait had been 
working in the Chinese city as a corporate finance manager for 
international firm KPMG since injuries forced him to quit rugby in 2010.

Mr Tait began his playing career with Sale in 2005, and made just 40 appearances before leaving the club after suffering a series of injuries.

Former Sharks' press officer and family friend John Everton said that everything appeared to indicate that Mr Tait was 'very happy' in Hong Kong.

It is the second tragedy to hit the family - his father Campbell Tait,
who was a barrister and a judge, was found hanged at the family home in
2004.

The back-row forward known as Taity, was signed by Sale as a teenager and went on to enjoy five years with the Cheshire club.

On the international stage, Mr Tait formed 
part of England’s training squad for the 2008-09 International Rugby 
Board world seven series, but did not feature for the side.

He did, 
however, play for Scotland at the 2009 Dubai Sevens.

The rugby world has been left 
devastated by Mr Tait’s unexpected death, with England’s Danny Care leading the
messages of condolence on Twitter.

The
Harlequins player wrote: 'Couldn’t believe the news y’day.Lost a good 
friend and an absolute legend of a bloke David Tait. RIP mate. Sending 
all my love to his family.'

Northampton
Saints fly-half Ryan Lamb said: 'Terrible news about the death of David
Tait. Top player and a top bloke, had some awesome times playing 
through the age groups with him.

In a further message, Lamb added: 'Thoughts go out to his family and to the sale lads in such a bad time. #RIP'

The Rugby Players’ Association chief executive Damian Hopley also spoke of his sadness, praising the former Sale Grammar School and Manchester University student as a 'gifted and popular young man'.

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Hopley said: 'The rugby community will be shattered by the passing of such a gifted and popular young man who was respected by everyone he played alongside.

'He wasn’t simply a talented rugby player, he was also extremely bright and successful in his life outside of rugby.

'We will do everything we can to help support David’s family.'

Mr Everton paid tribute to Tait saying said:  He was a fringe player, a good sevens player, and 
very popular.

'Everybody is devastated at the news and I'm sure fans will join me in expressing sympathy for the Tait family.'

He added: 'This is absolutely devastating. I had a brief moment with the family yesterday.

'They're so shocked. We don't know enough yet but we'll have to respect their privacy.'

It is the second tragedy to hit Sale Shark this year - in January, winger Selorm Kuadey died at the age of 24 after apparently taking his own life after also being forced to retire through injury.
