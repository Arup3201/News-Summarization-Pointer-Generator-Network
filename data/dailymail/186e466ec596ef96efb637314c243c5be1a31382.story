A coastguard spokesman said the conditions would've been 'very, very rough' when the man entered the water

Police confirmed the woman had been rescued but said the search remains ongoing for the missing man

Coastguard area commander Greg Albrighton, who was in charge of co-ordinating the search efforts, said the man 'disappeared'.

He told the Sunderland Echo: 'By the time anyone got here, there was time to rescue the woman but the man had disappeared.

'We have heard he went into the water after the dog got into trouble – the two people went in after the dog.

Police are expected to be planning to comb the beach at low tide at 10pm this evening for any sign of the man

Officers said the pair went into the water after their dog but got into difficulty in the 'rough' conditions 

'It would have been very, very rough, at the time, with the waves battering on the rocks.

'It was pretty much high water when we got here – the conditions made it impossible to go into the water.'

Rescuers are expected to continue with their search operation into the night and are said to be planning to comb the beach at low tide at 10pm.
