Pictures have emerged from the 'hen party' of Saddam Hussein's granddaughter, Banin.

Her mother posted pictures of her enjoying a pre-wedding celebration on Instagram.

Banin, whose mother is the former Iraqi dictator's eldest daughter, Raghad, enjoyed a traditional henna party on Thursday in Jordan before today's wedding to Badr Raad Mahmoud Nasser.

Popular in the eastern Mediterranean, the Gulf states, India and Pakistan, they often involve the bridal party having intricate patterns drawn on their hands, and sometimes feet, by artists using dried henna leaves, while friends and relatives perform dance routines. 

She was pictured wearing a traditional dark pink Arab outfit with silver embroidery, Alarabiya.net reported, and hugging her future husband.

Banin is seen signing her marriage contract in one picture, while another shows the wedding invite, which is in the shape of an eagle.

The eagle was the state emblem of Iraq when Saddam was in power and is associated with pan-Arabism, an ideology that favours the unification of the countries of North Africa with those in West Asia and around the Arabian sea.

It's a viewpoint that Saddam Hussein advocated throughout his rule from 1979 to 2003.

He branded Banin's father, Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a traitor and had him killed in 1996 after he'd returned from exile in Jordan.

The pictures emerged after former President George W. Bush said in a rare TV interview broadcast Sunday Morning that he was shocked to learn that Saddam Hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive U.S. invasion.

'You know, when he was captured, I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him – he said, 'I just didn't believe Bush',' he told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer Sunday morning.

'And it's hard for me to believe he didn't believe me.'

'We'd given an ultimatum to the Taliban and delivered,' Bush said. 'I make the point in the book, of course, that -- and Dad understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president, you better mean it.'

That line is already being interpreted on Twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at President Barack Obama, whose 'red line' ultimatums leveled at Syria and Iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless.
