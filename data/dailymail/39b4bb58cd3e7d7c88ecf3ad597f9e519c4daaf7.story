Alim Uddin was stabbed to death in a dispute with a 16-year-old boy in a row over a £90 bicycle, a court has heard

An A-level student was stabbed to death in a row with a 16-year-old boy over a £90 bicycle, a court has heard.

Victim Alim Uddin, 17,  met the younger boy to ask for his money back after he had failed to hand over the bike, and was knifed seven times in the chest and back, jurors were told.

A 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is on trial at the Old Bailey accused of his murder on May 4 this year. He denies the charge.

Prosecutor David Jeremy QC said: 'This defendant stabbed Alim Uddin to death. The reason, if there can be a reason, was that Alim Uddin had given (the defendant) £90 to buy a bicycle from him.

'(The defendant) did not provide the bicycle and he did not give his cash back so the two of them arranged to meet so, as Alim Uddin understood it, he could be repaid.

'He was angry that (the defendant) had ripped him off. There were on both sides expressions of youthful bravado but nothing that suggested it would lead to a killing.

'The friends of Alim Uddin described the two boys as being wary of each other but said Alim was not angry or expecting a fight. He just wanted his money back.'

The court heard that Alim had gone alone to meet the boy at Tilford House in Brixton, south London, after leaving his friends in a park close by.

Jurors were told that shortly before 5pm on May 4, a resident at the block of flats heard a 'thud' and discovered Alim collapsed on his doorstep.

One hour later he was pronounced dead at King's College Hospital.

A post mortem examination found seven incised wounds - four to the front of his chest, one to the lower back, one to the shoulder and one to the thigh, the court heard. 

Mr Jeremy said: 'The stab wounds suffered by Alim Uddin and the complete lack of injury suffered by (the defendant) paints a clear picture of how Alim Uddin came to his death.'

After the murder, the defendant was caught on CCTV going home and then leaving a short time later carrying a bag and wearing a different top bound for his a great aunt's house in Tooting, south west London.

When police searched his home, they discovered a blood stained sweatshirt with DNA matching Alim's on it, the jury was told.

The defendant had also taken clothes to a launderette in Tooting, but finding it closed, had soaked another top and a pair of jeans in the bath, the court heard.

Police found the clothes after they tracked down the defendant at the second address, along with a black bag, which contained the murder weapon with the handle wrapped in a glove, the court heard.

Mr Jeremy said: 'He is painfully young, he is a boy of 16, but he is obviously highly forensically aware.

'He was doing everything to distance himself from the killing of Alim Uddin because at that stage, what he was doing was keeping his options open.'

He was arrested in Tooting in the early hours of the morning with a bag containing the murder weapon, wrapped in a glove, jurors were told. 

The teenager later lied in interview when questioned about the murder, the court heard.

In the weeks before the killing, Alim Uddin had spoken to friends about his payment of £90 to the teenager, the court heard.

Mr Jeremy said: 'He felt he had been ripped off and he was angry that [the 16 year-old] had ripped him off.

'There were on both sides expressions of youthful bravado but nothing that suggested it would lead to a killing.'

Friends of Alim Uddin said that the two boys were 'wary of each other' but claimed that he was not angry before he headed to the meeting.

The 16-year-old boy, from Brixton, denies murder.
