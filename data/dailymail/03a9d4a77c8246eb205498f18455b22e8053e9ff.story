Eddie Hearn has moved to tempt Amir Khan into a blockbuster fight with Kell Brook by suggesting a winner-takes-all deal.

Khan has repeatedly been dismissive of a fight with the IBF welterweight world champion as he pursues Floyd Mayweather.

But with that bout seemingly unlikely, Hearn has told Khan ‘it’s big balls time’. He claims to have offered Khan $5million (£3.3m) to make a match before Brook became world champion.

Now, with Brook’s IBF belt, he claims even more money would be available for what could be a major stadium fight next summer.

Hearn told Sportsmail: ‘He knows where we are. He has so much to lose in fighting Kell but is adamant he would win with ease. If he truly believes that then this is the fight that would make him more money than any other.

‘I offered Khan $5m to take the fight before Kell won a world title. With a world title involved, the pot of money for this fight is even bigger. If Khan truly thinks he could beat Kell, then he should step up.

Kell Brook said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' when he was stabbed on holiday last September

‘I would back Kell every day of the week to win that fight. This year is going to be a big year for him and Amir wants the lion's share of the pot - we are more than happy to have a 60-40 for the winner or 70-30 for the winner. In fact, how about winner takes all? It's big balls time.’

Brook will fight on March in Sheffield for the first time following the horrific machete attack in Tenerife that left him fearing for his life. His opponent will be named on Thursday.
