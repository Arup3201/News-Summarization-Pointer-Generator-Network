Many people turn their phone off overnight or when charging, but a new malware could be taking advantage of this power-saving technique. 

Security researchers have spotted a virus that kicks in when the power button on Android phones and tablets is pressed.

It makes the phone appear to be switched off but instead the malware is running in the background making calls, sending messages and accessing other files and apps.

The malware is installed when the user downloads infected apps. When the power button is pressed, the malware shows a fake dialogue pop-up designed to look like the Android Power off menu (pictured). The phone then appears to shut down and the malware can make calls, send messages and access other files

In theory, once installed and enabled, the app has control of the phone and can perform any task the hacker wants it to.

A blog post from the Amsterdam-based antivirus firm explained that the malware is installed when the user downloads an infected app from an app store.

AVG hasn’t revealed which apps are carrying the malware and MailOnline has contacted the firm for more information.

It’s likely the apps are installed from third-party app stores rather than Google Play, due to Google’s strict policy on malware.

The malware is installed when the user downloads infected apps. 

When the power button is pressed, the malware makes the phone appear to shut down. 

The malware can then make calls, send messages and access other files and apps.  

Experts said the the only way to know a phone is actually turned off is to remove the battery.

The app runs in the background, so isn’t immediately noticeable and won’t appear as a rogue app or icon on the homescreen.

But, running a scan using an antivirus app will detect and remove the files. 

However, the Play Store has featured infected apps in the past, so users are advised to download all apps with caution, and to check reviews and developer details if they are unsure.

‘This malware hijacks the shutting down process of your mobile, so when the user turns the power off button to shut down their mobile, it doesn’t really shut down,’ said the researchers.

‘After pressing the power button, you will see the real shutdown animation, and the phone appears off. Although the screen is black, it is still on.

‘While the phone is in this state, the malware can make outgoing calls, take pictures and perform many other tasks without notifying the user.’

The malware does this by hijacking a line of code in the shutting down process and asking for root permission.

This gives the hacker permission to access and modify any files, apps and software on the device.

Once permission is granted, the malware shows a fake dialogue pop-up when the power button is pressed.

This is designed to look like the standard Android menu and when the ‘Power off’ option is selected, the fake animation is shown and the screen goes black.

It will continue to make calls and send messages until the phone is switched on and AVG said the the only way to know a phone is actually turned off is to remove the battery.

The outbreak is said to have originated in China and appears to only affect phones running older versions of Android - before Android KitKat.

Lenovo has come under fire for selling laptops that come pre-installed with a 'horrifically dangerous' software named Superfish. The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015

Lenovo has come under fire for selling laptops that come pre-installed with a 'horrifically dangerous' software named Superfish.

The Chinese computer manufacturer says Superfish helps users find products online by analysing images and presenting similar, cheaper products.

But security analysts claim that what Superfish actually does is serve intrusive ads, as well as compromise private information such as bank details and passwords. 

The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015.

Users can find out if they are affected by looking at Windows' list of trusted certificates by opening up the Control Panel and searching for 'certificates'.

If Superfish Inc is one of them, the computer may be vulnerable to attack.

Rather than simply uninstalling the programme, users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system.
