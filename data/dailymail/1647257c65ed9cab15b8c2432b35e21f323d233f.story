A Brazilian rent boy whose claims of drug-fuelled sex forced a Tory MP to quit as a minister's aide says he will name another Westminster client.

Rogerio Santos contacted a publicist this week claiming he wants to reveal details about another Conservative politician in exchange for a large sum of money.

Last year the male escort's allegations about Mark Menzies led the MP to resign as private secretary to the then International Development Minister Alan Duncan.

The new claims about an as yet unidentified MP are also believed to involve sex and illegal drugs.

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Mr Santos is very convincing. He wants to speak out again – but only for the right price.'

The rent boy, 20, claimed the second Conservative was a 'colleague' of Mr Menzies.

The source added that the new allegations would heap pressure on Mr Menzies, who plans to run again in Fylde, Lancashire, in May. 

The Brazilian said he and Mr Menzies met on a gay escort website and claimed the politician had given him a tour of the Houses of Parliament before allegedly offering to pay him £250 for a two-hour session. 

He insisted that Mr Menzies, who was one of David Cameron's 'A-listers' at the 2010 General Election, asked him to supply him with mephedrone – also known as M-Cat and Meow Meow.

Possession of the Class B drug became a criminal offence in 2010, however no charges were brought against the MP or Mr Santos.

The escort, who returned to Sao Paulo, Brazil, because his student visa had expired, made the claims to the Sunday Mirror in March last year.

He said at the time: ‘I have been having sex with a Conservative MP for money. Mark also asked me to buy mephedrone. I have messages of him talking to me about drugs.

‘We met very regularly over the last 18 months. He took me to the Houses of Parliament. Recently, he has been asking me to buy drugs. I have SMS messages and photographic evidence.’

Mr Santos is also reported to have a photograph of Mr Menzies next to a plate of mystery white powder.

Discussing the picture, Mr Santos said: ‘There is a plate of mephedrone. He asked me if I could buy methedrone. He had many drugs, a lot of drugs.’ 

He also claimed that he had received a text from Mr Menzies in which the MP asked ‘What underwear you have?’, and another in which he told the rent boy to meet him in south London and ‘bring sexy underwear’.

The Tory MP said at the time: ‘I have decided to resign as a Parliamentary Private Secretary after a series of allegations were made against me.

'A number of these allegations are not true and I look forward to setting the record straight in due course.’
