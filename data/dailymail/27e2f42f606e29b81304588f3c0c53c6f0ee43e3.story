CCTV stills show driver Michael Kitching high on cocaine and stumbling around the garage whilst his car was left blocking the exit. He is awaiting sentence for driving whilst unfit through drugs

He appears on CCTV to struggle to get out of his car at a Shell petrol station forecourt on West End in Guisborough, North Yorkshire.

He is then seen staggering across the forecourt before going into the kiosk - pulling out bank notes and trying to pay for petrol that he has not put into his car.

Two police officers wait outside to arrest him before he gets back behind the wheel.

Inspector Mick Little, from the Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit, said: 'This footage shows the effects that drugs have had on the man and how irresponsible and extremely dangerous his decision to get behind the wheel of the car was.

Police have released the CCTV images from as a stark warning to others. The officers waited outside the shop, pictured, for Kitching to come out and get into his car

'Mr Kitching has been fortunate that he did not seriously injure or even kill anyone while he was driving in that condition.

'Let this be a stark warning to anyone who even considers driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. You will be caught and you will be put before the courts. You could lose your licence or even your freedom.'

Cleveland Police are taking part in the national ACPO drink and drug-drive campaign throughout December and into the New Year.

This year the campaign aims to target drivers under the age of 25, who, according to Department for Transport figures, fail more breath tests, or refuse to provide a specimen, than any other age group.It also targets those who drink alcohol or take drugs and drive the next morning while still under the effects.

Staff at the petrol station in Guisborough, North Yorkshire, had spotted the driver acting erratically and called the police who arrived to have words with Kitching, pictured

Kitching, , of Fernie Road, Guisborough, appeared before Teesside Magistrates' Court this month and pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while unfit through drugs.

Concerned staff raised the alarm after they saw him behaving 'erratically' at the Shell garage at West End, Guisborough.

He was seen struggling to get out of his Peugeot 106 on the garage forecourt, the court was told.

Kitching left the car causing an obstruction to other vehicles, and his 'erratic' behaviour continued after he went into the shop.

He was described as having slurred speech and was seen to have a trace of powder around his nostril.

Police were called to the garage on September 22 this year.

A blood sample was taken from Kitching, who has two previous convictions for drink-driving offences, and it was found to contain cocaine, the court was told.

Amy Dixon, defending, said he had struggled with drug misuse but was seeking help for his problems.

The magistrates asked the probation service to prepare a report on Kitching.

But they warned him that 'all options' would be open he returns to be sentenced.

An interim driving disqualification was imposed until his next court appearance.

Kitching told the court: 'I don't intend to ever drive again.'

He is due back in court on Thursday, December 27.

He was granted bail, on condition that he doesn't enter the Shell garage at West End, Guisborough.
