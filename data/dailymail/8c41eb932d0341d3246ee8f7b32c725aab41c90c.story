Police have released a second video 
they hope will help lead to a breakthrough in the mystery of a mother 
who went missing while working the register of a western Michigan gas 
station April 26.

Jessica
Heeringa, 25, who has a three-year-old son, vanished 15 minutes from 
the end of her shift at an Exxon gas station in North Shores. Her car 
and purse were found left behind at the scene.

The new video, police say, more 
clearly shows traffic in the area, including a silver minivan that 
police have been in search of as they've continued trying to unravel 
this mystery.

A $15,000 reward was pledged by Exxon Mobil to go toward a reward fund for Heeringa, who was working at an Exxon Mobil station when she disappeared.

The new
footage comes from a business a mile from the Exxon station, which had 
no cameras, and show's the silver van passing around 11:04pm.

Police believe Heeringa disappeared between 10:50 and 11:15 that night.

Clue: Christian Van Antwerpen, pictured, says he heard the van's driver flirting with Heeringa 'suspiciously' hours before she vanished April 26

Antwerpen said he did not see the man, but only heard his voice.

The
tip is yet another among the hundreds police say have come in since 
Heeringa vanished and will be added to what small bits of evidence 
investigators have thus far been able to gather.

The sketch of a wavy-haired man was released April 30, 
based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from 
the gas station - and police hoped it would reinvigorate 
their investigation.

'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton 
Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some 
of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the 
sketch.

Mystery: Heeringa has a three-year-old son, who family members said she would never leave behind

'Someone knows this person. That is a very good drawing. Someone is going to know who that is.'

Authorities
have also released previous video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead 
Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area 
around the same time that Heeringa went missing.

Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, 
but hoped releasing it, too, could help unlock the 
mystery.

Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV:
'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it 
up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesnâ€™t exist for me.'

He
told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & 
Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's 
disappearance.

Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old.

Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor.

'There
is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who 
the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews.

Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm.

Vigil: A friend hugs Shelly Heeringa, Jessica's mother, during a vigil at Pointes Mall in Norton Shores

That
customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he 
normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there.

After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police.

Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend.

In the call, he tells the dispatcher:
'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just 
walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car 
out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.'

Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm.

The missing woman's family made a
heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her 
disappearance as an abduction.

Plea: Shelly Heeringa attended the vigil for her daughter on Tuesday as police released the sketch

In
a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were 
treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene.

No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter.

Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes.

Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.'

With no surveillance footage from the gas station, police are relying on public information for help in the investigation.

'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.'

The
anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved 
by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing 
his mom and wants her back.'

Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident.

'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.'
