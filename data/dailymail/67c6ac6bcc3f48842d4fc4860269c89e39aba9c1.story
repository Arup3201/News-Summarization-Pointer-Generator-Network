It’s one of the drawbacks for anyone setting off for far-flung places: How bad will the jet lag be when you get there?

Those feelings of tiredness and disorientation could become a thing of the past, however - thanks to what are claimed to be the world’s first ‘time-control’ spectacles.

The high-tech glasses emit a soft green glow which is said to work on the human body clock to change our sleep patterns.

Light work: Researchers in Australia have launched world's first spectacles which reset your body clock to combat insomnia and beat jet-lag

Using the device, called the Re-Timer,
means long-haul air passengers can step off the plane feeling fresh, 
even after a flight from Britain to Australia, say the sleep researchers
who created it.

Inventor Professor Leon Lack said the 
glasses could also help insomnia sufferers, keep shift workers more 
alert and get teenagers out of bed in the morning.

‘The light from Re-Timer stimulates 
the part of the brain responsible for regulating the 24-hour body 
clock,’ said Professor Lack, of Flinders University in Adelaide, South 
Australia.

‘Using a light device allows you to 
transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps. This 
eliminates the sudden change people experience after flying and reduces 
the symptoms of jet lag.’

The scientists say the light exposure 
changes the behaviour of a gland at the base of the brain which controls
the body clock.

In the dark: Sleep researcher Prof Leon Lack said a green light helps to readjust the body's internal clock

It sends signals to the rest of the body, triggering 
the production of hormones, which create daily cycles known as circadian
rhythms.

Those who wanted to sleep and wake up 
earlier should wear the device for 50 minutes in the morning, while 
those who want to sleep and wake later should wear them for 50 minutes 
before bed to delay the body clock, say the researchers.

The battery-powered glasses, which are
on sale in the UK on the Re-Timer website for £162, can be worn while 
completing normal daily tasks such as working on the computer or 
reading.

Almost 94 per cent of passengers 
experience jet lag after a long flight.

This is because travelling 
through different time zones confuses the body clock, which uses cues 
from the outside world – such as light, dark, silence and noise – to 
tell the body when it should be asleep or awake.
