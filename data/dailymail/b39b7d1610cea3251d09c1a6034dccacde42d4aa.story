Advances in Stone Age man’s language and culture, might have been driven by climate change, scientists claim.

Scientists believe surges in innovation in early modern human populations coincided with periods of heavy rainfall.

People living in the Middle Stone Age, between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago, in an area that is now South Africa, used symbols to communicate, which have been linked to the development of complex language.

Scientists from Cardiff University's School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, the Natural History Museum in London and the University of Barcelona, said that these symbols, as well as personal adornments made of seashells, coincided with increased rainfall and receded in dry periods.

They studied a marine sediment core off the coast of South Africa and reconstructed terrestrial climate variability over the last 100,000 years to come up with their findings, which were published in the journal Nature Communications.

Dr Martin Ziegler, of Cardiff University, said: ‘We found that South Africa experienced rapid climate transitions toward wetter conditions at times when the Northern Hemisphere experienced extremely cold conditions.’

Professor Ian Hall, also of Cardiff University said: ‘When the timing of these rapidly occurring wet pulses was compared with the archaeological datasets, we found remarkable coincidences.

People living in the Middle Stone Age, between 80,000 and 40,000 years ago, in an area that now lies in South Africa, used symbols to communicate, which have been linked to the development of complex language.

Scientists said that these symbols, as well as personal adornments made of seashells, coincided with increased rainfall and receded in dry periods.

The occurrence of several major Middle Stone Age industries fell tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall.

The disappearance of the industries appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions, they said.

The South African archaeological record is so important because it shows some of the oldest evidence for modern behaviour in early humans.

‘The occurrence of several major Middle Stone Age industries fell tightly together with the onset of periods with increased rainfall.

‘Similarly, the disappearance of the industries appears to coincide with the transition to drier climatic conditions.’

Large Northern Hemisphere cooling events have previously been linked to a change in the Atlantic Ocean circulation that led to a reduced transport of warm water to the high latitudes in the north.

In response to the Northern Hemisphere cooling, large parts of the sub-Saharan Africa experienced very dry conditions.

Dr Ziegler said: ‘Our new data however, contrasts with sub-Saharan Africa and demonstrates that the South African climate responded in the opposite direction, with increasing rainfall, that can be associated with a globally occurring southward shift of the tropical monsoon belt.’

is so important because it shows some of the oldest evidence for modern 
behaviour in early humans.

Professor Chris Stringer of The Natural History Museum, London, said: ‘The correspondence between climatic ameliorations and cultural innovations supports the view that population growth fuelled cultural changes, through increased human interactions.

‘The quality of the southern African data allowed us to make these correlations between climate and behavioural change, but it will require comparable data from other areas before we can say whether this region was uniquely important in the development of modern human culture.’

The study examines a time in prehistoric history far before the late Stone Age, some 6,000 to 2,000 years ago. People living at this time were known to carve representative pictures into rock, epitomised by famous engravings in the Kunene region in Namiba, Africa
