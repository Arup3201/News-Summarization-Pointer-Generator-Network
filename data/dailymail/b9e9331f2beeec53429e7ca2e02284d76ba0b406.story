A kindhearted police officer has been photographed helping a man in a wheelchair carry his groceries home.

A passerby snapped Officer Tom Ondecker walking alongside the disabled man for about half a mile on Ohio's State Route 14 to his nursing home on Saturday.

Streetsboro Police Department where Ondecker works shared the pictures to show 'what it means to be a police officer', alluding to the escalating violence in Ferguson, Missouri, after a cop shot dead an unarmed man.
