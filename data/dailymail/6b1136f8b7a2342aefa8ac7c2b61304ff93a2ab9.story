A waiter who dreamt he would win the Lottery the day before he bought a winning £1million ticket will keep half of the jackpot after his boss's bid to get the lot fell through in court.

Fatih Ozcan envisaged himself holding bundles of cash as his restaurant's manager Hayati Kucukkoylu stood in front of him.

The next day Mr Ozcan shared his premonition with his boss and Mr Kucukkoylu gave him money from the till to buy a Euromillions ticket, with the pair winning the Millionaire Raffle and getting their hands on £1million.

But the young waiter's dream turned into a nightmare when his boss declared that all the winnings should be his, as the money used to purchase the ticket came from his till.

Despite having a party at the restaurant to celebrate the win in January 2012, Mr Kucukkoylu claimed he had paid for the £9 ticket and chosen the numbers and was therefore owed the full winnings. 

The war of words ended up in court, with a judge ruling last year that the cash should be split 50/50.

Mr Ozcan persuaded his boss to donate money from the restaurant till towards the ticket - as he felt that if the two joined forces they would win.

But the waiter claimed he had paid half the stake and contributed to the number choice - and was therefore due a share of the cash.

Ruling on the case, Judge Mark Gosnell said Mr Ozcan 'had a dream' on the night of January 29, 2012.

'He dreamt that he was holding a large bundle of cash and, standing in front of him, was his boss.

'Mr Ozcan is a strong believer in the power of dreams and interpreted this to mean that he and Mr Kucukkoylu would win the lottery,' he said.

The next day, Mr Ozcan 'pestered' his boss for several hours before he relented and passed him coins from the restaurant's till to towards the ticket. 

The pair won £1million on the Euromillions draw after clubbing together to buy a ticket in January 2012

The inspired waiter who went to a nearby supermarket and bought the ticket which yielded the riches, the court heard.

But Mr Kucukkoylu, 47, who runs the Kapadokya Turkish restaurant in York, said he paid the entire stake and had chosen the winning numbers, claiming the winnings should be his.

Mr Ozcan was adamant that it was his dream that prompted the win, that he had paid half the £9 stake and that some of the number choices were his.

He later complained to police, alleging Mr Kucukkoylu had 'stolen his winning Lottery ticket from his jacket pocket'.

He told Lottery operators Camelot the same story - and Mr Kucukkoylu was arrested and held for nine hours before he was eventually released without charge.

Mr Ozcan later admitted making the bogus allegation because he wanted to stop his boss from 'getting his hands' on the cash and 'sending it back to Turkey'.

Last year Judge Gosnell found that the men each played an equal part in the win and that each had paid half the stake.

Both judges viewed a series of increasingly angry texts between the pair and CCTV footage of events in the restaurant as the winning slips were filled in.

The footage strongly suggested that both men had shared the task of choosing the winning numbers and that each had paid half of the £9 stake. 

The judge concluded: 'I find that the effect of these conversations was that Mr Kucukkoylu and Mr Ozcan entered into a contract to jointly play the lottery on an equal basis.

'There should be a declaration that the prize money from this winning lottery ticket should be shared equally between Mr Kucukkoylu and Mr Ozcan.'

However Mr Kucukkoylu disagreed with the ruling and appealed, saying that he deserved the full £1million. 

Mr Kucukkoylu's barrister, Mark Cannon QC, argued at the appeal hearing yesterday that Judge Gosnell 'failed to understand the significance' of the text messages.

Court battle: A judge ruled that they should split the cash 50/50, with Mr Kucukkoylu appealing the decision

Dispute: An appeal judge ruled the pair, who worked at Kapadokya (pictured) restaurant in York, must split the cash 50/50, with each man taking home £500,000

But Lord Justice Pitchford said: 'In my view, this argument has no real prospect of success.

'The judge acknowledged that the weight of the texts appeared to support Mr Kucukkoylu's case and Mr Ozcan's explanation of them depended on the judge's conclusion as to the nature of the relationship between them.

'Rightly, in my view, the judge concluded, in the end, that the texts were equivocal.

'He assessed that he had to rely on other factors to determine whether the ticket was purchased jointly.

'This led him to prefer the evidence of Mr Ozcan on a number of significant issues, including the texts. There is no reasonable argument that the judge misunderstood the importance of the text evidence.

'The conclusions he reached were properly open to him and I see no real prospect of the Court of Appeal reaching a different conclusion. For that reason, the application must be dismissed,' 

Lord Justice Pitchford ruled that the money should be split 50/50 between the pair.
