A would-be home invasion suspect landed in a world of pain when he tried to take on a homeowner nearly three times his age - who pummeled him with a flurry of punches.

Michael Salame, 70, of Gardner, Massachusetts - who has a bad heart, arthritis and other health problems - said he awoke early Saturday morning to strange sounds in his home.

He went downstairs to find the suspect, 24-year-old Timothy Adams, who had allegedly broke a window to get into the house.

CBS Boston reported that Mr Salame reached for his phone to call police, but dropped in when Adams confronted him.

Mr Salame told the station that he wasted no time, grabbing the suspect by the throat and 'slamming him down on the floor' - and ordering him to keep his hands out of his pockets.

'I didnâ€™t know if he had a knife or a gun on him,' Mr Salame told CBS Boston.

He said that when the suspect tried to get away by running up the stairs, he finished him off with a series of punches with the intensity of a mixed martial arts fighter.

Mr Salame told CBS Boston: 'I decked him three times with a right 
and he went down again. I give him three good rights - I 
caught him right in the face. He went down and he never got up again.'

As a result of some nerve damage, Mr 
Salame has to wear metal bracelets that he says gave him a competitive edge and 
'worked like a boxing glove.'

While hitting Adams, he called to his wife Elaine to phone police.

Salame said that Adams offered him $100,000 to let him go, but gave him up to the cops instead.

Adams was charged with breaking and entering and destruction of property.

If his actions don't already prove it, Mr Salame drinks his coffee out of a mug that says 'Old Guys Rule' - adorned with a picture of John Wayne.
