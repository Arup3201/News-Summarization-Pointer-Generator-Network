Gordon Strachan has called for more from his Scotland team, warning that not one of the 90-minute performances from his reign thus far will be good enough to overcome Germany on Sunday.

The highlights since he started guiding Scotland in the right direction include back-to-back defeats of Croatia who, when beaten 1-0 in Zagreb in June 2013, were ranked fourth in the world.

Scotland’s unbeaten streak stands at six matches but the national coach believes it will require something of a greatest hits compilation of their best work from the last 18 months to enable his men to stun the world champions in Dortmund.

Demands: Scotland boss Gordon Strachan says they'll need to combine the best of their recent efforts

When asked to pick one Scotland team display from his tenure that would satisfy his demands for the opening Group D test, Strachan replied: ‘I think I’ll have to pick different bits out of some games.

‘There’s the defensive side in Croatia, the attacking against Nigeria, the attacking and bravery when we played England. If I threw all that in, then I think we’d need that.

‘I don’t think there is a “one performance” that would give us a victory. It’s elements of it all sewn in that would give us the chance.

‘But, even with that, what I can’t plan for is some brilliance from some of the Germany players. Sometimes, if that happens, you’ve just got to stand up and say: “Fair enough”.’

If it’s a Scotland player who conjures a moment of such brilliance this evening, then a slot in national sporting folklore is guaranteed.

Strachan booked his place with a goal against West Germany in Mexico at the 1986 World Cup Finals, albeit Scotland then conceded twice to lose.

More recently, Gary Caldwell and James McFadden scored in remarkable home and away performances to see off a world football superpower in France.

The stage is there for one of Strachan’s number to record a career highlight as Scotland team up against the brilliant Brazil 2014 winners.

That defining act of glory will only be possible, though, if Scotland’s dirty work is on a par with that which so frustrated the French twice on those nights in Euro 2008 qualifying.

‘I think people talk about “the goal”, no matter what happens,’ Strachan said. ‘Of course, you want to go into a big game and be the best player on the pitch but as part of a team at the same time and on a winning side.

‘They’ll talk about McFadden’s goal, Gary Caldwell against France. But you’ve got to remember that behind every individual’s moment, the defending was phenomenal.

‘If you remember rightly, especially at Hampden, the bravery and commitment the defenders showed was amazing. I don’t think Scotland had another chance at goal and I think Scotland defended that well the French got bored. They had that much of the ball and ran out of ideas.’
