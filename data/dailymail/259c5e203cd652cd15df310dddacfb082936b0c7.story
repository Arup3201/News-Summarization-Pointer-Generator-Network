The 9mm pistol that Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev used to murder one police officer and gravely wound another came from a brutal street gang in Maine that is allegedly led by an Eritrean immigrant.

Tracking the path of the Ruger P95 semiautomatic pistol has led investigators to believe he may have dealt drugs to finance the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three spectators and injured more than 260 others.

Drug money is also believed to have funded the 26-year-old's 2012 trip to Chechnya and Dagestan in Russia, where he became involved in radical Islam.

Fighter: Tamerlan Tsarneav had a semiautomatic pistol that he used to killed one police officer and wound another as he tried to escape Boston after the bombings

Deadly: Tsarnaev had a Ruger P95 9mm pistol, similar to the one shown here. It carries 15 rounds in the magazine and can be purchased for $375 or less

The Los Angeles Times reports that Tamerlan used the weapon to ambush 27-year-old MIT police officer Sean Collier April 18, 2013 and kill him. Collier died of multiple gunshot wounds.

Then, when authorities closed in on Tamerlan and his brother Dzhokhar as they fled Boston, Tamerlan opened fire with the pistol. He shot at officers until the gun was either empty or it jammed.

Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority officer Richard Donohue Jr, 33, was critically wounded in the shootout.

Tamerlan was killed after being shot multiple times by officers and then run over and dragged as his younger brother tried to escape in a stolen SUV, authorities say.

When investigators recovered the handgun, they found that the serial numbers had been scratched off - a common tactic among drug dealers who are hoping to prevent police from tracking down the original owner of the weapon.

However, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were able to decipher the unique identifier - serial number 317-87693, according to the Times.

Shootout: Tsarnaev emptied the magazine of his pistol - 15 rounds - at police before he was gunned down April 19

They found that it was legally purchased at a Cabella's sporting goods store outside Portland, Maine, in November 2011 by Danny Sun Jr - a Los Angeles native. The gun typically sells for about $375.

Sun told investigators that he gave the pistol to Biniam Tsegai, a 27-year-old Eritrean immigrant who goes by the street name 'Icy.'

The Times reports that Tsegai is a reputed leader of a Portland, Maine, street gang with a lengthy arrest record - including robbery, criminal trespass and reckless driving.

In May 2013 - a month after the marathon bombings - Tsegai was arrested and indicted on federal drug trafficking charges. Prosecutors noted that the drugs he is accused of trafficking were brought from Boston to Maine.

Tsegai has refused to talk to authorities about the Ruger pistol - or anything else.

However, Tsarnaev's possession of the weapon have strengthened their suspicions that he was involved in drug trafficking.

They have not been able to prove his involvement, but suspect he had something to do with the September 11, 2011 murder of three men in an apartment outside Boston who were found with the throats slit. Marijuana and $1,000 in cash was found sprinkled around the crime scene.
