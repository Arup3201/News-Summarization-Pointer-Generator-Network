LEE CLAYTON, head of sport - RORY MCILROY

Rory McIlory. He just hits the ball, he doesn’t need the car. Hamilton has been terrific and I listened to him clinch the title while driving home, with some outstanding radio on Five Live. He didn’t win the award last time he was world champion and I fear he will miss out again. There seems to be a disconnect with the British public, but he is doing everything he can to change that.

MATT LAWTON, chief sports reporter - RORY MCILROY

McIlroy. Credit to Hamilton for securing a second world title but you can't ignore the fact that he's won a two-horse race this season. McIlroy, however, has now proved himself the world's finest golfer. An amazing year for him.

JON McEVOY - LEWIS HAMILTON

Both are great sportsmen but only one wants to be known as British and, despite living in his second tax haven, that man is Hamilton. McIlroy, by declaring himself Irish for Olympic purposes, should not be handed a British bauble.

CHARLES SALE - RORY MCILROY

It has to be Rory McIlroy. So much more difficult to win a major golf championship than an F1 Grand Prix, which were effectively two-horse races this season with both competitors from the same stable. Plus McIlroy helped win the Ryder Cup.

MIKE DICKSON - RORY MCILROY

Rory McIlroy should win by a mile ahead of Hamilton. McIlroy does not enjoy a huge technological advantage over his opponents and in real sport everyone competes on level terms.

PHIL DUNCAN - LEWIS HAMILTON

He should have won it in 2008 after clinching the F1 title in the most dramatic of circumstances but was beaten to the punch by Sir Chris Hoy and I fancy Rory will get the better of him this year, too.

A pity because Hamilton deserves it. A winner of 11 races this year under huge pressure, and isn’t it time British motor racing was recognised at SPOTY? Damon Hill was the last winner, a mighty 18 years ago.

DEREK LAWRENSON - RORY MCILROY

Let's see... the guy who has just compiled the finest season in the entire history of UK golf or the bloke who came first in a two-car race. I think it might just be Rory McIlroy. 

JEFF POWELL - RORY MCILROY

Rory McIlroy – even went so far as to sacrifice his starry girlfriend so as to rescue his game. 

IAN LADYMAN - RORY MCILROY

Because the golfer competes in a sport where all participants begin equal. Hamilton does not.  

MARCUS TOWNEND - RORY MCILROY

Rory McIIroy seems a vibrant young man, the sort you would enjoy having a chat and drink with. Hamilton seems charmless. In a contest judging sporting achievement and personality it is no contest.

MATT BARLOW - RORY MCILROY

Rory for me. Consistently brilliant and a refreshing personality. Outside those two, perhaps a nod to Gareth Bale for his CL heroics. 

LAURIE WHITWELL - RORY MCILROY

Without doubt Rory McIlroy. While he beats opponents with the craft of his two hands, any Formula One driver is only as good as his car.

Hamilton is very good, of course, but so are the Mercedes mechanics. McIlroy has recovered his mojo and is accelerating at a rate that could challenge the all-time greats.

Just to recap: he won the Open, the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup this year. In such a wide and talented field that is remarkable. He also has that personality bit.  

PAUL NEWMAN - RORY MCILROY

Hamilton's achievement is fantastic but it has to be Rory for me. Technology just plays too big a part in motor racing for it to be pure sport.

LAWRENCE BOOTH - RORY MCILROY

It's McIlroy for me. It's harder to win a golf major than a grand prix. And you've got no one to help you.
