If you have time on your hands and the urge to wander, it could be the ideal proposition for you.

A luxury travel firm is offering a 365-day tour spanning four continents and 32 of the most exclusive hotels on the planet.

The only catch is the price – because at £220,000 per person, it is likely to be well outside most people’s price range.

Starting in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, the holiday takes in Asia, North Africa, Europe and the United States – ending 19 countries later in India.

And in case it didn’t seem decadent enough already, the trip also includes an 11-night stay in the Aman Canal Grande hotel in Venice – where George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin held their lavish wedding ceremony in September.

The year-long jaunt is being offered by Asia specialist Ampersand Travel and hotel group Aman, and it is understood a number of wealthy clients have already expressed an interest.

James Jayasundera, managing director of the company, said: ‘This trip will feel like being part of a private club and guests will be treated like royalty. It aims to appeal to high net worth individuals in need of a pampering sabbatical.’

However, should travellers really need to get in touch with the office, Mr Jayasundera promises that ‘each hotel offers connectivity’. The itinerary is designed to celebrate the best of each country, with visits timed to take in the most awe-inspiring sights.

It begins in March 2015, with spring in Bhutan – when the Himalayas are alive with flowers.

Next is Thailand, where travellers will have access to a private white sand beach and the opportunity for excursions on the Andaman Sea.

Then it is a tiny tropical island, Pamalican, in the Cuyo Archipelago in the Philippines. The idyllic atoll is less than 600 yards across, and the surrounding Bohol Sea is the perfect spot for sailing, windsurfing, fishing or snorkelling.

Following that is Beijing, with a chance to explore four of China’s Unesco World Heritage sites including the Summer Palace. Sushi and Tokyo’s Mount Fuji come next, then a Balinese marine reserve.

And despite this extensive tour of Asia probably being enough for most holidaymakers, the tour then heads for Europe after a relaxing cruise down the Indonesian archipelago. The first stop is Greece, and – after a stay on the Turkish coast – the trip heads to a 15th-century village in Montenegro.

Late September is spent in Venice. Then, as the northern hemisphere braces itself for winter, the tour returns to Bhutan.

And just in case the trip becomes a bit too relaxing, travellers can get their blood pumping on the ski slopes of Utah, Wyoming and the French Alps. At the end of January the tour heads to Sri Lanka, before finally ending in rural India.

However, the company is keen not to exclude those whose diaries are looking a bit too full to justify a whole year on holiday – and they are also offering the trip in a series of 90-day breaks.
