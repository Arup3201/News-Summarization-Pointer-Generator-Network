A new mother has shed almost four stone of baby weight after she overheard colleagues gossiping about her expanding waistline.Stunning Claire Hamilton, 29, shrank from a size 14 to a size 8 after cutting out comfort food after bitchy colleagues left her devastated.Claire, from Gillingham, Kent, piled on the pounds after giving birth to her daughter, Isla, in November 2011.

Despite the new mother making several attempts to shed her baby weight, it wasn’t until she heard colleagues laughing about her looks that she was spurred into starting a serious diet.

And after just over three months on a strict diet plan normally recommended only to obese people, Claire dropped three dresses sizes.

Claire, who works as a window dresser
for a department store, said: 'I knew I’d put on weight after I had 
Isla, and I wanted to lose it, but it just never seemed to be a 
priority.

'I
wasn’t happy with how I looked, but it was only when I heard other 
people talking about me that I got the kick up the backside I needed to 
do something about it.

'I was in a toilet cubicle at work when I heard two other girls that I work with talking about me.

Claire shrank from a size 14 to a slinky size 8 after ditching the comfort food and said picturing herself in a bikini helped to keep her on track

'They were saying that I’d really let
myself go since I’d had my little girl. I heard one of them say: ‘Maybe
she just doesn’t realise how fat she is now?’

'I was devastated. I had always been very slim and really taken pride in my appearance.

'That
was the motivation I needed to lose the baby weight. That night, I 
logged onto mumsnet and asked people how they’d lost the baby weight - 
and loads of people recommended the Cambridge plan.

Claire says that having the same colleagues who she had overheard gossiping about her weight gain tell her how good she looked made her feel good

'It’s a very strict diet which is 
just what I needed. I’m all or nothing, so as soon as I committed to a 
diet where I was only allowed to eat shakes and soups, I was really 
committed.'

Claire, who is 5’4” tall, managed to shrink from tipping the scales at 11st 13lb to a tiny 8st 4lb in just over three months.

The Cambridge Weight Plan is a diet based on meal replacement products.

Using the brand bars, soups and shakes, people following the diet eat a meal plan consisting of between 440kcal to 1500+kcal per day.

The meal replacements can also be combined with normal foods on the diet for a slower weight loss.

The diet programe is generally only suggest for those with an 'over-weight' BMI (over 25).

Claire said: 'Those girls really upset me on that day, but they really did me a favour.

'I didn’t recognise the person they were talking about.

'My partner always told me that I was beautiful, but I worried that one day he would be thinking the same as they had done.

'I wanted the old me back, and as soon as the pounds started melting away, it was easy to keep going.

'It was so easy for the pounds to creep on when I was a new mum. I was putting all my energy into looking after Isla, and I just stopped caring about how I looked.

'But now I realise that I can do both.

'Every time I wanted to cave in and have a bar of chocolate, I’d just picture myself in my bikini, and I’d keep going.

'I started going swimming twice a week too, to tone my muscles, which was a huge help.

'People at work started to notice once a stone or so had come off, and I got loads of compliments.

'The same people who I’d heard talking about me told me how good I looked - I’ve never told them that I overheard them, but it did make me feel good.'
