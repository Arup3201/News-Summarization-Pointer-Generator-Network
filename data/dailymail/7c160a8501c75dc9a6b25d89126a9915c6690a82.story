A man who hit on a woman in the streets of eastern Kazakhstan got more than he bargained for - he got floored by the response.

Kondrat Golubev, 32, had been partying with friends in the city of Atyrau when he went outside for a cigarette and spotted two girls.

Initially Mr Golubev asked them if they fancied a drink, but when his offer was rebuffed he changed his tact and asked them how much they charged for sex.

So how much? Kondrat Golubev asks the women how much they charge for sex in the eastern Kazakhstan city of Atyrau and the response he gets isn't a positive one

I'll hit on you: One of the woman takes offence to the question and punches Mr Golubev in the head

Anatoli Pokrovski, 36, who witnessed the ill-fated pick-up attempt said an argument soon broke out between the trio. 

He said: 'The women were clearly offended and he never expected what happened next, even though the woman really telegraphed the punch. She hit him so hard he fell flat on the pavement.'

Mr Pokrovski said the other women then kicked the man while he was on the ground, before her friend said 'he'd had enough'.

He said the pair then walked off as if 'nothing had happened'.

Mr Pokrovski said: 'It was pretty shocking really, but what a punch.'

Lights out: He lies flat on his back following the punch and was said to have suffered a concussion as a result

One for good measure: The other woman then adds insult to injury by kicking Mr Golubev in the groin

Mr Golubev was later taken to hospital and was said to be suffering from a concussion.

Police are now hunting the two women involved and having seen video of the incident, believe the woman who threw the punch 'is trained in some form of martial arts'. 

A police spokesman said: 'We don't think she is a boxer because of the way her thumb extends over the top of her index finger.

'But the force behind that punch was so great we suspect this is not the first time she has hit something hard.'
