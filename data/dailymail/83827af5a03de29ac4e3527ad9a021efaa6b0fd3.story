The man's time in the limelight was short-lived, however, as he was bundled away by officers

A man has been arrested after disrupting the Olympic torch relay by running naked past spectators.

The streaker had 'Free Tibet' written on his back and managed only a short distance before being tackled by police in Henley-on-Thames.

He was covered in a blanket by officers and led away.

A Thames Valley Police spokeswoman confirmed that a 27-year-old man from Henley has been arrested on suspicion of outraging public decency.

Hundreds of onlookers watched the man disrupt proceedings in the Oxfordshire town as the torch made its way through on the 53rd day of the relay.

A Henley resident who was lining the procession route said the streaker came out of the crowd.

Andrew Tinsley, and environmental scientist, said: 'The guy came out of nowhere. He definitely picked his moment to shine.

'The streaker completely out-footed the policeman on the other side of the bus.

'The juxtaposition of the bus relay logo of a running man and the streaker was immensely funny.'

As well as emblazoning his back with the message, the streaker also carried a fake Olympic torch as he ran past spectators.

On a notable day on the Olympic Torch 
relay, the Queen welcomed torchbearers to Windsor Castle.

Local residents ran through the grounds of the royal residence with the flaming symbol of the London Games as excitement over the global event mounted.

In 17 days the Queen will declare the Games open during a spectacular ceremony at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London.

In the run-up to the sporting spectacular the Olympic flame has been travelling around the UK and has been greeted by cheering crowds for much of its journey.

In the castle's quadrangle the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh watched as torchbearer Gina Macgregor, 74, ran into the open space after earlier receiving the flame from Renate Beynon, 66.

Its journey began today in Oxford where athletics legend Sir Roger Bannister started the flame on its way at the site of his greatest sporting achievement, the Iffley Road track where he broke the magical four-minute mile barrier on a balmy evening on May 6, 1954.

When the flame is exchanged between runners they touch their torches together, known as a 'kiss moment'.

But in a bid to allow the royals to 
watch a handball demonstration from schoolchildren the symbol of the 
Games was put into a lantern.

Minutes before the flame arrived grey
 skies which had been threatening rain let go a torrential downpour 
which forced guests under the shelter of the castle's Sovereign's 
Entrance.

Mrs Macgregor, from Taplow near 
Slough, arrived soaking wet and met the Queen who was wearing a rain 
cape and wielding an umbrella with Philip by her side.

Laughing, Mrs Macgregor told the royal couple 'I looked fine this morning', and they both began chuckling.

Earlier in the day, Sir Roger Bannister was joined by London 2012 chairman Lord Coe at the Iffley Road track in Oxford.

Sir Roger said: 'It's an honour to be
 included in a list of torch carriers which has included injured 
soldiers back from Afghanistan and other places, and I'm glad that it's 
taking place on this track in Oxford where I ran the four-minute mile in
 1954.

Roger Bannister completed the first ever four minute mile at an athletics meeting in Oxford in 1954

'It
 brings back happy memories and it also brings back some remembering of 
the weather. Today it looks like it might rain and that day the weather 
was so bad that I nearly decided not to attempt it.

'In retrospect, I'm glad because if I hadn't attempted it that day I might not have had another chance.

'In
 a way I'm back in the sport that I belong to. I spent 10 years training
 before I broke the four-minute mile. I send my best wishes to all those
 who are training now and are competing in the Olympics in London.'

Lord Coe said: 'It's very special. Roger has done so much inside British sport.

'Breaking the four-minute mile as a mark
 of athletic achievement sits central in the history of our sport. He 
paved the way for what we did in the late 70s and early 80s.'

Hundreds of people watched as 
83-year-old Sir Roger carried the flame along the athletics track before
 handing the torch to 25-year-old student Nicola Byrom.

Rowing legend Sir Steve Redgrave also carried the flame in a boat along the River Thames through Henley-on-Thames.

Sir Steve Redgrave's leg of the relay was overshadowed somewhat by the appearance of a streaker in Henley-on-Thames

Sir
 Steve, a five-times Olympic rowing gold medallist, travelled through the
 upmarket town in an eight-man boat using an oar with one hand and 
carrying the torch in another.

The former Olympian was able to keep up a sedate pace that allowed the thousands of spectators lining the route to cheer him on.

In the background was the River and 
Rowing Museum where the boat Sir Steve used to win his fifth gold medal 
at the 2000 Sydney Olympics is on permanent display.

He
 exchanged the Olympic flame with the previous torchbearer as he sat in 
the slimline vessel and then, with seven other rowers and a cox, set off
 on a circuit of the riverbank.

Once he had his feet on dry land, Sir Steve set off on a brief run to hand the flame on to the next torchbearer.

He said: 'To have my hands on the torch is pretty special. It’s surreal - when I retired in 2000 I was asked to come on to the bid team.

'What we were working towards were the Games in 2012 and now it’s just 18 days away.'

Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal carries the Olympic Flame on the Torch Relay leg today in Slough

Sir Steve Redgrave, who won an unprecedented five gold medals in his illustrious career said it was 'pretty special' to be asked to carry the torch

Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal also took part in the torch relay as it passed through Slough.

The
 Michelin-starred celebrity chef, renowned for his snail porridge and 
sardine ice cream dishes, said he was close to tears as thousands of 
people lined the streets to watch the flame pass.

He said: 'I had no idea there were going to be this many people here. I've got a proper lump in my throat.

'The turnout is incredible. The energy - this is what the Olympics is all about.'

The torch will travel a total of 87 miles today, and be transported by 111 torch bearers on the 53rd day of the relay.
