Two brothers who found the remains of the plane flown by their grandfather in the First World War have spent 12 years restoring it to working order.

David and Rick Bremner from Milson, Shropshire, have scoured the globe looking for parts to rebuild the Bristol Scout Type-C plane once piloted by their grandfather, Francis Donald Holden Bremner.  

The pair have spent out over £100,000 since they found three small parts  in his shed following his death in 1983 and have finally completed the reconstruction this week.

Flight Sub Lieutenant Bremner had flown the plane between 1914 and 1918 while serving with the Royal Naval Air Service during the Gallipoli campaign.

On his return from battle the war hero had always told his family he would like to see the aircraft take to the skies once again.

To honour their late grandfather's wishes David, 63, and Rick, 61, along with friend and amateur pilot Theo Willford, 66, began looking for the other components that would complete the aircraft.

Starting with just a joystick, rudder bar and magneto - an electrical generator which uses magnets - found in the shed the trio have travelled the world looking for the rest of the parts - many no longer in existence - including the engine, which was purchased in New Zealand.

After a staggering 10,000 hours of building the plane from scratch, this week they put the final touches to the aircraft, which has a wingspan of 24ft and is 20ft in length.

It is due to take the skies in spring next year and the trio plan to fly it over the River Somme on July 1, 2016, marking exactly 100 years since the fateful day in 1916 when almost 20,000 British soldiers lost their lives in France.

The trio are celebrating this week after completing the restoration of the plane and plan to take it to the skies for the first time in spring

It will be the only flyable Bristol Scout Type-C anywhere in the world when it finally takes off. 

David, who works as a mechanical engineer and is chairman of the British Microlight Aircraft Association, said he believed his grandfather would be proud.

He said: 'We grew up less than 10 miles from my grandfather in Kent so we heard all his war stories.

'Although he talked about flying a lot he had never mentioned keeping these parts before.

'When we found them we knew they belonged to his favourite plane because the magneto was made by Bosch, the German company.

'Back in those days it was very hard to get German parts obviously, but my grandfather had told us the story of how he traded a few bombs and some food to a French base in return for the Bosch magneto.

'So these parts came from that plane and it would make sense that he would keep hold of them because it was his favourite aircraft he had flown.

'He said one day he would like to see it fly again over British skies.'

The brother's have spent over £10,000 on the plane and wanted to rebuilt it as a tribute to their grandfather who died in 1983

These three pieces of the plane were discovered when David and his father, Ian, 91, were clearing out Francis' workshop, following his death in 1983.

They quickly realised they had found the part which provides a spark for the engine, from the pilot's beloved No.1264 aircraft.

But it was not until Mr Willford, a fellow amateur pilot, encouraged the family to start rebuilding the plane that the project came about.

In 2002, the trio began researching where they could find appropriate parts to start rebuilding the plane before work began in 2010. 

David, a grandfather-of-two, added: 'We had the parts for years and had the idea in the back of our minds that one day we would try to rebuild the plane.

'But it was Theo who actually got us to make a start.

'We started researching what the plane would look like and because the parts don't exist anymore we had to plan what replacements we could still get now.

'The three original bits we had only probably made up about two per cent of the whole thing, so there was so much left to do.

'The only thing we didn't make ourselves was the engine, which we got from a New Zealand-based company and it's is an actual 1917 engine in a beautiful condition.

One of the Bristol Scouts crashed on the island of Imbros in Turkey, which is now officially known as Gökçeada, in March 1916

'The aircraft is pretty much finished now apart from the petrol tank and the fabric covering the fuselage.

'Rick and I live in Shropshire but Theo lives in Dorset, so we took small things down to him and then brought them back in a trailer when he was working on it.

'I think our grandfather would be proud of us re-building his favourite plane, but he'd probably say we've spent far too much time and money on it as well.'

Sub-lieutenant Holden, nicknamed 'Bunnie' because he was always twitching his nose, was in active service between, throughout the whole of the First World War.

After the war he worked as a patents engineer in Brasted, Kent and lived with his wife Vivyen, and two sons, Christopher, and Ian - Rick and David's father.

During 1916, Officer Holden had been stationed on the islands of Imbros and Thasos in the Aegean Sea as part of the Royal Naval Air Service, and flew seven Bristol Scout Type-C planes.

His favourite plane of the seven had Serial No. 1264 and he kept three small parts of that aircraft in his workshop until he died aged 89.

Rick, a builder and father-of-two from Tenbury Wells, added: 'It's been a huge privilege to be part of this project. It's just fantastic.

'We all just wish my grandfather was here to answer a lot of questions we have about details of the plane, because he could have told us straight away.

'We have old photos of what the plane should look like, but when you try to zoom in to look a specific details, it's too grainy to make out.

'But fortunately we got there in the end - its been a long old labour of love but it's been worth it.

'I think its a fitting tribute to my grandad and other British pilots who battled so valiantly for us during the Great War.' 

Flight sub-lieutenant Francis Bremner, nicknamed 'Bunnie' can be seen in the seat of the Bristol Scout on Thasos, Greece, in June 1916

The Bristol Scout was a single-engine, single-seat fighter intended to supply ground commanders with an advantageous 'eye in the sky'. 

The initial prototype, Scout A, was unveiled in 1913 with a top speed of 100 miles per hour, a service ceiling of 14,000 feet and an endurance of 2.5 hours.

Its design was regarded as very streamlined and consisted of a well-contoured fuselage with the single rotary piston engine set to the front and a conventional tail to the rear.

The engine powered a two-bladed wooden propeller and the open air cockpit was held just under and aft of the upper wing assembly with generally adequate views.

The Scout B was established as an early militarised form and led to the development of the Scout C – which was the one flown by the Bremner's grandfather.

Type C aircraft was first ordered by the British government on November 5, 1914, in a 12 aircraft production batch for the Royal Flying Corps.

In was later commissioned by the competing Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in a 24-aircraft batch and its first combat was in February 1915.

It was armed with a standardised mounting and a 7.7mm Lewis machine gun along the left side of the fuselage away from the spinning propeller arc. Some were also finished with their guns fielded across the upper wing assembly. 

Its targets ranged from enemy aircraft (patrol, escort, interception), bombers, observation balloons, ground-based 'targets of opportunity' and even Zeppelins, which regularly patrolled airspaces.

The C type Scout was followed by Scout D in November 1915, when 210 aircraft were produced.
