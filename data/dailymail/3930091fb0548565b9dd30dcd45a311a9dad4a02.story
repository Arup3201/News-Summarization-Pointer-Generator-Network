Olympic swimming champion Ryan Lochte's parents have lost their Florida home to foreclosure just two years after he pulled in millions of dollars in endorsements. 

The final judgement on Steven and Ileana Lochte‘s Port Orange, Florida home took place on October 31 last year, according to newly-released court documents.

Their son Ryan Lochte, 29, has 11 Olympic medals - five gold, three silver and three bronze - and earned millions of dollars in endorsements from brands such as Gatorade and Ralph Lauren.

Foreclosure: CitiMortgage has taken control of the Lochtes' home in Port Orange, Florida after they failed to keep up with mortgage payments

His parents were first sued by CitiMortgage in 2012. The bank has claimed that the Lochtes took a loan for $258,000 in 2007 which was due to be repaid at a rate of $1,609.58 a month.

However, according to court documents first obtained by RadarOnline, the couple stopped making mortgage payments in 2011 and owed more than $242,000.

The judge signed an order in favor of the bank for around $300,000.

The bank is yet to put the suburban home up for auction. The Florida property is nestled among trees and, as might be expected, comes with a swimming pool.

The Lochtes, who have five children, divorced in 2011, according to court filings.

Ryan Lochte's earning potential rocketed following his success at the London Olympic Games in 2012.

He had his own reality TV show What Would Ryan Lochte Do? on E! but it was canceled after one season.

Prior to the 2012 Olympics, Fortune Magazine estimated that Lochte earned $2.3 million from endorsement deals with brands including Speedo Gatorade and Ralph Lauren.

He now has an estimated net worth of $3million, according to reports.

According to RadarOnline the Olympian was unable to help save his parents’ home.

Born in New York, Lochte started swimming at 
five years old and was coached by his swimming teacher father. He 
qualified for his first Olympic Games in 2004.

Lochte has announced he will continue to swim professionally through to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The swimmer's parents stopped making mortgage payments just months after Steven Lochte, 61,  was arrested for a DUI in April 2010. A misdemeanor DUI meant that Mr Lochte was stripped of his license for one year, Gainesville police said.

Lochte has numerous lucrative endorsements earning him millions including with sports drink Gatorade
