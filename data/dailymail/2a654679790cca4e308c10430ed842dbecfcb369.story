Glorious sunshine has made way for a drizzly start to the weekend, with scattered showers making their way across Britain.

It is a far cry from yesterday when a heatwave swept across the country and sunbathers basked in record temperatures of 27C.

All is not lost however, forecasters say, as they predict that the rain will make way for a mild night. The showers are expected to clear and make way for a dry and pleasant evening, with temperatures in the mid 20s.

‘Going into next week it’ll stay dry and settled with temperatures staying in the 20s,’ she said.
