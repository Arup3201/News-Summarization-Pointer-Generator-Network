Family and friends of a 29-year-old diabetic have described the 'suffocating helplessness' of losing their loved one to a rare condition known as 'dead in bed syndrome'.

Emily Pearce, a type 1 diabetic, died a year ago from the condition which causes unexplained deaths in young people suffering with the disease.

Despite having managed her blood sugars successfully for 10 years, Emily died in her sleep after experiencing a suspected hypoglycaemic episode – a period of extremely low blood sugar levels.

Emily Pearce, a type 1 diabetic, died a year ago from 'dead in bed syndrome' - a little understood condition that describes unexplained deaths in young people suffering with the disease

It is the term used to describe unexplained deaths of young people with type 1 diabetes.

There is little evidence as to the exact cause of this rare phenomenon.

One theory is that it is caused by an episode of extreme low blood sugar while the person is asleep.

It is thought to account for around six per cent of deaths in under-40s suffering with type 1 diabetes.

Emily, a social worker from Crowthorne in Berkshire, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was a 19-year-old university student.

She was very successful at managing her condition and managed to live life to the full, taking part in everything from scuba diving to abseiling and charity runs.

However, despite showing no previous signs of illness, Emily was found dead in her bed at Easter last year.

Following Emily’s death, her older sister Alison wrote a tribute to her on a memorial blog: ‘I am Emily's big sister and I am heartbroken.

‘The
period from April has been the hardest of my life and I wrestle daily 
with my emotions to keep it all together and trust that my mind and body
somehow knows what to do on this crazy unknowable grieving journey.’

She wrote: ‘I am one of many 
devastated people in Emily's world. I was totally blown away by the 
hundreds of people paying their respects at her funeral, some of whom I 
knew, but many I didn't.

‘Emily
with her acute modesty I hope understood on some level how liked, loved
and respected she was and how many people she had inspired and what a 
lasting difference she had made in her profession because these are 
things everyone aspires to in life.’

Alison's partner Iain blogged: ‘Emily was one of the most kind and caring people I have ever known.

‘She welcomed me in to her family and
over the last seven years, we shared some fantastic times together 
which have not only left me with treasured memories but also, in her 
absence, a desire to carry on something of the legacy of Emily's 
goodness in my own life.

‘That
night, the 60 mile drive, the police, the coroner, the shock, the 
adrenaline, the disbelief that was the only barrier against the 
torrential and surging waves of pain.

‘Nothing can ever prepare you: I was 
not removed from the tragedy, the horror, the suffocating helplessness 
while the people you love are being ripped apart before your eyes - I 
could not turn the page, I could not turn it off, I could not 
rationalise it.

‘I struggled terribly to cope with the enormity of what happened; what was happening in front of me, and I still do.’

A team of Emily's friends and family are running the London Marathon in her memory. They are hoping to raise £30,000 for Diabetes UK

Alison told MailOnline: ‘She was a friend to me as well as being my sister – we were very close.

‘She was very dedicated to her work, she always challenged herself and she was always smiling.’

Emily’s mother, Susan Pearce, also added to the memorial blog.

She wrote: ‘Emily was a very happy 
little girl brought up by myself and David with her big sister Alison as a
playmate, companion, friend and role model.

‘She lived her short life to the full and achieved so much in her 29 years.

‘There were lots of proud moments in Emily’s life - she was always setting herself challenges.

‘It
is very apparent that Emily made a huge impact on everyone she knew 
during her short life, so we all have wonderful memories to cherish, and
are in awe of her many achievements and challenges.’

Emily had planned to run this year’s London Marathon to raise money for Diabetes UK.

At Emily’s funeral, 15 of her friends and family agreed to run the race in her memory, and attempt to raise £30,000 for the charity.

Alison said: ‘Emily had a list of things she wanted to do before she was 30 and the London Marathon was one of those things.

‘Training for it has helped us cope and it has been really nice to get to know some of her friends.

‘It has also helped us personally to have a goal. Iain and I have run it before, though, so we know how tough and emotion-laden a day it will be for all of us.’
