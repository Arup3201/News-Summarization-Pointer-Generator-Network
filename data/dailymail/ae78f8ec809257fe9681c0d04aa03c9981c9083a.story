Shares in Royal Mail will be sold to the public next month – before staff can vote on strike action.

In one of the biggest privatisations since the days of Margaret Thatcher, it will be valued at up to £3.3billion – more than expected.

Members of the public who want a stake in the postal service must buy shares worth at least £750, and have until October 8 to register their interest.

Under government plans published yesterday, shares are expected to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on October 11, a week before the end of a ballot of workers over a possible strike.

The Communication Workers’ Union, which is opposed to the privatisation, is threatening industrial action over pay.

Royal Mail warned yesterday: ‘Potential investors should assume that national strike action and other forms of industrial action will take place across the whole of the group’s activities during the period immediately after, and may take place during, the offer period.’

The earliest a strike could take place is October 23.

Shares will cost from 260p to 330p, although the exact price will not be known until nearer the time.

The Government is selling up to 70 per cent of its stake in the group, which could raise as much as £2billion for the Treasury.

Financial institutions such as pension funds began ordering shares yesterday.

Demand was so high that the offer was heavily oversubscribed, suggesting that the share price will be at the higher end of the scale.

Members of the public can collect order forms from the Post Office or download them online.

Royal Mail yesterday published its prospectus, which sets out all the details of the company.

It revealed that a host of banks advising the Government, led by Goldman Sachs and UBS, will receive more than £50million in fees for working on the deal.

This summer, the Royal Mail’s Canadian chief executive, Moya Greene, was criticised for accepting a £250,000 payment from the firm to buy a home in one of London’s plushest districts.

She was forced to pay it back after Business Secretary Vince Cable intervened.

Last year the group made profits of £324million after handling 17.4billion letters and 1.4billion parcels.

It expects the volume of letters sent to drop by up to 6 per cent a year, while the number of parcels it collects is expected to rise by 5.5 per cent.

Posties visit 75 per cent of the UK’s addresses every day, it is estimated.

Miss Green said: ‘Royal Mail has a unique place in the UK and that will not change.

‘We will now be better able to compete in what is a fast-changing and intensely competitive market.’

Mr Cable said: ‘Today is an important day in the life of the Royal Mail. We have already committed to give eligible Royal Mail staff a real stake by giving them 10 per cent of company shares free.

‘Now the sale of government shares will give others a chance to have a real stake in this important company.’

However, critics claim most people are against the sale.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has vowed to reverse the move, and Labour last week voted to re-nationalise the group if it wins the election.

Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna said: ‘This is in the face of huge opposition from the public and Royal Mail’s employees and a real concern about what the sale will mean for customers and communities.’

ALEX BRUMMER's Analysis

Consumers seeking a flutter on the £3.3billion Royal Mail share offer will have to get their skates on.

Applications for a stake in Britain’s emblematic letter and parcel delivery service must be in by October 8, a remarkably narrow selling window.

The Government wants to make the shares as attractive as possible by offering a generous dividend of between 6.1 per cent and 7.7 per cent.

At a time when bank deposit accounts pay virtually no interest and the return on ten-year government stocks, or gilts, is just 2.71 per cent, that is a tempting return.

This is especially so because the company is promising a ‘progressive’ dividend policy. This means it should continue to rise at least at the rate of inflation in future years.

Generally speaking, people who took up privatisation shares in the past have done remarkably well, with British Gas the outstanding performer, climbing 795 per cent since the Thatcher government sold it off in 1986.

But like any share offering, the Royal Mail retail sale will not be for the faint-hearted.

Anyone picking up a share offer pack will be greeted with an alarming list of risks, from the need to invest in its IT systems to the possibility that it could be affected by the vote on Scottish independence.

By far the biggest threats, however, come from the unions and the possible return of a Labour government in 2015, which could try to take the Royal Mail back into public ownership or impose price controls.

There may be a strike soon after Royal Mail reaches the markets, despite the fact that 10 per cent of the shares are reserved as freebies for the 150,000-plus posties.

In addition, it recently made one of the most generous three-year pay deals – at 8.6 per cent – for any industrial group.

The key to the Royal Mail’s success will likely be its parcels service, which is highly profitable.

As a ‘royal’ chartered enterprise, it pays no VAT in Britain – although rivals are taking it to court over this issue.

Its main commercial challenge is the requirement to run a ‘universal postal service’, which could be a costly anvil around its neck. But the biggest threat is that the Royal Mail is snapped up by foreign buyers.

That would be a tragedy for an organisation that traces its origins back to 1516 and is part of the fabric of the nation.
