David Cameron today said his long-awaited Europe speech would be worth the wait

David Cameron today defended delays to setting out his vision for Britain's place in Europe, claiming the government's policy making was like tantric sex and would be worth the wait.

The Prime Minister is due to set out his 
thinking on Britain’s future in Europe in a much-delayed speech amid growing agitation in the Tory party over the issue.

London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday suggested Mr Cameron is preparing to promise a referendum 
offering either a new, looser relationship with the EU or a British 
exit.

But the PM insisted he did not want Britain to leave the EU, but was determined to secure changes for 'our benefit'.

Speaking to journalists in Westminster, Mr Cameron said: 'Thank you for reminding me that my Europe speech is as yet unmade.

'This is a tantric approach to policy-making. It will be even better when it does eventually come... That wasn't in the script'

Mr Cameron went on to say three things were 'happening at the moment' in Europe: 'What I think is right for the country, what I think is politically deliverable and what is deliverable diplomatically.'

He added: 'I don;t want Britain to leave the European Union, I think we benefit crucially from the single market.'

He said critics needed to 'understand' what withdrawal would mean, noting how Norway is forced to accept instructions from Brussels over which it has no control. Mr Cameron branded it 'government by fax'.

'I believe Britain does have a future in Europe, particularly in the heart of the single market. It is very important that we are writing the rules of that market rather than just obeying them.'

Big mouth: Mayor of London Boris Johnson revealed that the Prime Minister is going to announce his ideas for Britain's future relationship with the EU and that a referendum is on the cards

Mr Cameron will use his speech within weeks to insist he does not 
think it would be in Britain’s interests to leave the EU but wants to 
return to a more arms-length, trade-based relationship with Brussels.

It is 'obvious' that an independent Scotland will have to reapply to join the EU, president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso said today.

Asked if Scotland would need to reapply to join if it leaves the UK following the referendum in 2014, he said: 'I did not comment on specific situations of member states because I very much respect that it is their right, their sovereign right to decide about their organisation.

'Now what I said, and it is our doctrine and it is clear since 2004 in legal terms, if one part of a country - I am not referring now to any specific one - wants to become an independent state, of course as an independent state it has to apply to the European membership according to the rules. That is obvious,' he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme.

The Westminster government insists Scotland would have to reapply, but the Holyrood government denies this.

The Spanish government has vowed to veto admission for a new independent state, fearing the reaction from separatists in Catalonia.

He is expected to set out details of how he wants to renegotiate our membership, repatriating powers in key areas.

But
Mr Johnson, who has discussed plans for a referendum with Mr Cameron, 
predicted voters would be offered ‘broadly an in/out referendum on the 
new terms’.

His intervention irritated Downing Street, which has been reluctant to discuss what the Prime Minister is planning.

Former Tory cabinet minister Dr Liam Fox increased the pressure on the Prime Minister today, insisting that the party needs a ‘settled position that is clear, concise and consistent’.

‘The longer we hold a clear position, the more likely we are to be credible and thus to both take advantage of a growing trend amongst the British electorate and to see off parties such as UKIP by supplanting them rather than accommodating them,’ he said in a speech.

The former defence secretary said public attitudes point towards a ‘new, looser and largely economic relationship with the European Union’, adding: ‘I, for one, hope to see “back to a common market” as the Conservative slogan on Europe at the next general election.’

‘To be frank, if the choice is between the current trajectory towards ever closer union and leaving, then I would choose to leave, albeit reluctantly. 

‘If the choice is between a looser, more economic relationship and leaving, then I would choose to stay. It is a view that , I believe, is gaining ever greater traction with the British people,’ he added.

London Mayor Mr Johnson said yesterday that Britain should exploit the eurozone crisis to free itself from key areas of the EU, including fisheries policy, social policy and farming subsidies.

He agreed with Mr Cameron that an in/out referendum on the current terms of membership was ill-advised, a shift from the position he held earlier this year.

‘If you have a simple in/out referendum I think at the moment the chances are that the British people would say stuff that for a game of soldiers, and 56 per cent say let’s pull out,’ Mr Johnson told Sky News.

‘Now the risk - and I’ve been writing 
about Europe for about 25 years, and I spent a long time in Brussels as a
correspondent, and the really good bit about it is the single market --
that’s something that allows British firms, British jobs, British 
enterprise to work freely with other European countries in a way that I 
think might be in peril if we were to pull out unilaterally.

‘So all I’m saying is let’s have a renegotiation in which we chop off the bits we don’t like, chop off all the kind of excrescences likes the fisheries policy and the social chapter or whatever.

‘I think probably what David Cameron is going to say, he’s got some speech coming up, I reckon he is going to commit to a referendum which will be broadly an in/out referendum on the new terms.

‘So we’ve got to go in and get a better deal for Britain, which is basically the single market, making sure that British ministers are in the internal market able to protect British interests, make sure that British companies continue to have unfettered access to that market.’

Mr Johnson, seen as one of Mr Cameron’s chief rivals for the Conservative party leadership, repeated his attacks on Eurozone countries for rushing ‘full tilt towards fiscal union’.

As Mr Cameron prepared for a Brussels summit on Eurozone plans to coordinate banking policy later this week, the Mayor predicted such a union would be a ‘disaster’ for those countries that join it.

Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair warned last month that Mr Cameron would be shunned by other EU leaders if he attempted to carve out a special deal for Britain in exchange for agreeing to a new Eurozone treaty on political and economic union.
