Prince Harry arrived in the U.S. last night on a two-month elite helicopter training programme, paving the way for a second tour of duty in Afghanistan.

The third in line to the throne will split his time between Naval Air Facility El Centro, close to the Mexican border in California, and Gila Bend in rural Arizona where he will be taught advanced techniques of flying the Apache attack choppers he once described as 'awesome'.

Exercise Crimson Eagle will take place in locations that replicate the brutal terrain of Afghanistan - over soaring mountains and vast desert with temperatures that reach well in excess of 110 degrees.

Arrival: Prince Harry lands at U.S. airbase at El Centro, he will be 
training for two months - and be treated like any of the 
other students

The rigorous training is reserved for the British Army's Air Corp's top flying talent and will see 20 men complete the final stage of the ‘Conversion to Role’ course which focuses on honing aviation environmental skills and live firing and includes techniques such as ground skimming and night flying.

Lt Col Peter Bullen, the exercise director, said: 'He (Harry)is treated exactly the same as any other. He would not want to be treated any differently.'

El Centro's commanding officer, Captain Devon Jones, added: 'We will treat him as we do all our visiting personnel. We are going to do operations as normal.

'We welcome all our UK counterparts, he is part of the British contingent. The base facilities are open to him as any other.'

Challenging conditions: El Centro regularly welcomes foreign students, as the dusty environment are similar to those in Afghanistan

Apache training: The course is the final part of a 16-month study period - the next stop could be Afghanistan for the pilots

Assuming, as expected, he passes the course, Captain Wales - as he is known in his professional life - will be one of a select number of pilots to have expertise in the £46 million, two-person, helicopters of which Britain has a fleet of 67.

He will be categorised as Limited Combat Ready and will have at least four months of further training before he is available to return to the field as an Apache pilot.

It has long been known the prince is keen to return to combat after his first deployment in 2007 was cut short after ten weeks, much to his disappointment, because of security fears.

If he is deployed next year his main tasks will be to provide air cover for ground troops and to seek and destroy Taliban positions.

The Apaches are vital tools in the fight against the Taliban specifically designed to destroy tanks and can operate in all weathers, day or night.

They can detect, classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in a matter of seconds.

The aircraft carry a mix of weapons including rockets, Hellfire missiles and a 30mm chain gun.

Exercise Crimson Eagle is the culmination of 16 months hard work by Harry and his fellow servicemen who graduated from the Army Air Corps Wattisham base in Suffolk in the spring.

A spokesman for the MoD warned there would be little free time for Harry, 27.

'It is an intensive training exercise with limited downtime,' said the spokesman.

'Whatever spare time Captain Wales will be afforded with his fellow colleagues, he will spend privately.

'He is travelling to the United States in a military capacity and will not be undertaking any Royal or public engagements.'

Harry will have some down time to visit the bright lights of Las Vegas

But his two months in the states won't be all hard work and he will have some time off to explore his new surroundings.

Lt Col Bullen said: 'We are not placing specific restriction on downtime. Their down time is spent at their discretion.'

Ministers have been told that 200 Al Qaeda extremists with expertise in aviation terrorism are planning a ‘spectacular’ atrocity.

Members of the worldwide terror network are plotting in a ‘safe space’ in Yemen – and Britain is a top target, according to MI6.

David Cameron and his National Security Council have been warned by intelligence chiefs that Al Qaeda is still capable of launching a major strike against British, American or European airliners ten years after the 9/11 atrocities.

A senior ministerial source told the Mail: ‘We know they are looking around the whole of Europe trying to find a weak link. When they spot an opening we expect them to go for it again.’

The Prince may struggle to find a great deal nearby to keep him entertained, however.

The nearby town of El Centro has a population of 40,000, it is dominated by agriculture and fast food joints.

Twenty minutes drive away is the Mexican border but the soldiers are banned from crossing the border because of the security fears.

Should he want to venture further afield, the vibrant city of San Diego is within two hours drive, as is the desert resort of Palm Springs.

He will fair even worse when he transfers to Gila Bend, half way through his three month stay, which has been described as a 'one horse town'.

There is just one bar in the Best Western hotel which bizarrely is modelled on a space ship.

The one bright light on the horizon for Harry's social life is that he is free to visit Las Vegas - a traditional spot for a bit of rest and relaxation a month into the course.

Asked by the Mail if the Prince and his fellow trainees would be allowed to visit the wild party town, Lt Col Bullen said: 'Absolutely, if they want to fund it themselves and that's what floats their boat, then absolutely they can go.'

Asked specifically about Harry, he added: 'If he wants to, then yes, if that is what interests him.'

And already the Harry Hunters of America are getting excited about the prospect of having a Prince in Sin City.

US reality TV star and former Playboy playmate Laura Croft wants to be his guide.

She asked: 'He’s been labelled a party animal so who better than me to show him the world’s party capital?'.
