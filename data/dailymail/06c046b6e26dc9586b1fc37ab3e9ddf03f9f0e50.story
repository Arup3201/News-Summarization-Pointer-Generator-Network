A watchdog found the language and presentation in the Hacked Off advert implied the proposals had been endorsed by Lord Justice Leveson (pictured) 

An advert by Hacked Off, which is campaigning for tougher regulation of the Press, has been banned on the grounds it is misleading.

The ruling by watchdogs will embarrass the lobby group, which has been found guilty of failing to live up to the high standards of fairness and accuracy it demands of the Press.

The group hoped the power of celebrity would help it to victory in its cause and crafted an advert designed to win support. 

It featured the names of more than 200 public figures it said backed its campaign, which appeared under the headline: ‘The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration’.

The language and presentation implied the proposals had been endorsed by the judge who led the inquiry into Press standards.

In fact, there was no such endorsement from Lord Justice Leveson in the advert, which ran in the Guardian and some other publications. 

In a ruling today, the Advertising Standards Authority said the language used by Hacked Off was ‘confusing’, ‘ambiguous’ and ‘misleading’.

The decision may disappoint the many famous names recruited to support the declaration, who ranged from actor Stephen Fry to former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. 

The ASA said: ‘A national Press ad featured a number of names and the claim “What do all these people have in common? The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration”.’

It went on to state that leading figures were joining people who had suffered abuse at the hands of the media to support the establishment of a new Press regulator as set down in a Royal Charter agreed by MPs in 2013.

The Press and this new body would be overseen by a Recognition Panel set up by Royal Charter, which critics argue is the first step towards State regulation of a free Press.

The ASA said the group was wrong to use the name The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration without any clear qualification as it would lead the public to believe it was ‘one of the direct outcomes of the Leveson inquiry, rather than a response to it’.

Hacked Off said it would appeal and insisted it had only ever used the Leveson name to distinguish its proposals from others that were being put forward.

It even suggested the ruling was a political decision to please the Press. 

A spokesman said: ‘We believe that the advert promoting the Royal Charter was very clear in what it was aiming to achieve and was not misleading.’
