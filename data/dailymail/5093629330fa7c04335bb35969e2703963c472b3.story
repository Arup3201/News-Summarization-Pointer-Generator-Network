Manuel Pellegrini has insisted Manchester City's owners did not expect them to win the Champions League because they know the 'project' is not ready.

Pellegrini believes he will not be sacked despite his team's exit from the competition on Wednesday night at the Nou Camp and that owner Sheikh Mansour did not believe City were ready to be crowned European champions yet.

They have spent £327million on new players in the last four years but Pellegrini, manager since May 2013, is not worrying about his job after being knocked out by Barcelona.

Asked whether he feared he would be sacked, Pellegrini told Sky Sports: 'I'm not stupid. When you have so many rumours maybe one of those rumours can be true or not. 

'If you are asking me if I feel I will be sacked if I don't win against Barcelona, I can answer you no. I'm sure I am not going to be sacked. 

'I understand that maybe in the media you have an allegation of what the owners of this club are. I think they don't think or don't believe we are going to win the Champions League now. 

'I don't think they think that the project is ready. If you are eliminated, it is because we saw a very good Barcelona, better than our team, and not because we've seen a poor Manchester City team.' 

Speaking after the game, Pellegrini added: ‘Maybe it was not our best year to continue in Europe. 

'We've had important restrictions about amount of players, amount of money that we can spend, so it was a difficult year for us.'
