Busted: Alexa Nasonti, 25, will serve no more than 18 months in jail after admitting to having sex with a student

A 25-year-old high school art teacher in Ohio admitted on Monday to having sex with a 17-year-old student after police found the pair alone together in a parked car at a city park.

Alexa Nasonti will serve no more than 18 months in jail and must register as a sex offender following the tryst in March with a student who attends Norwalk High School, where she worked.

Phone records revealed hundreds of text messages between the two that showed evidence of a sexual relationship, prosecutors say.

Police began investigating when they found Nasonti and the teen alone in a car in Castalia, Ohio, on April 2.

Nasonti claimed at the time that 'it wasn’t what it looked like' and 'there was nothing going on,' the Sandusky Register reported. 

When the teen refused to allow police to see the text messages on his phone, officers subpoenaed the phone records for both Nasonti and the student.

Text messages revealed that she and the teen had had sex at her home in nearby Bellevue, on March 31 -- just two days prior being discovered in the park.

The two had sent each other messages the next day discussing their rendezvous.

Incriminating: Nasonti's phone contained hundreds of text messages between her in the teen. Some of them discussed their sexual encounter at her home

Trusted: Nasonti taught art and was an assistant softball coach at Norwalk High School, where the boy was a student

Nasonti pleaded guilty to a single count of felony sexual battery.

She was placed on from the high school when the allegations came to light. 

She resigned in May.

Nasonti taught art at Norwalk High School and was an assistant softball coach.
