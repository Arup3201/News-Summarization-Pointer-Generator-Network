A smiling Semyon Varlamov was told on Monday that he is free to continue playing for NHL franchise the Colorado Avalanche while he faces charges for brutally beating his girlfriend in her own apartment.

Varlamov appeared in court for a brief hearing as the judge formally advised him that he faces a misdemeanor charge of third-degree assault. He said nothing as he left the courtroom with his lawyers - obviously pleased with the outcome.

His agent has protested his innocence and the 25-year-old is not due to enter a plea until his next hearing on January 22 where he will face one count of third-degree assault and if convicted, could receive a sentence ranging from probation to two years in prison.

All smiles: Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov leaves county court after a hearing in Denver, on Monday, Dec. 2, 2013. A judge has allowed Varlamov to remain free on bond while facing a domestic violence charge involving his girlfriend

Most misdemeanor cases in Denver are settled with plea bargains, but a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office declined to say whether an agreement was likely in this case.

Neither Varlamov nor his attorneys commented when they left court Monday.

Varlamov's girlfriend, Evgeniya Vavrinyukat, told police he knocked her down with a kick, stomped on her chest and dragged her by her hair at their apartment on Oct. 30, according to an arrest affidavit.

She also accused him of telling her that he would have beaten her more if they had been in Russia, authorities said.

He wore a blue suit and open-collar white shirt in court on Monday and gave yes or no answers to the judge.

Varlamov, 25, is one of NHL's hottest goalies and has helped the Avalanche to a franchise-best 19-6 start.

He is free on $5,000 bond and has been traveling and playing with the team. The judge has ordered him to stay away from his girlfriend and told him he could not drink alcohol or possess firearms.

The NHL has released a statement following the charge:

'We are aware of the decision made by the Denver District Attorney's Office today to pursue misdeamnor assault charges against Avalanche Player Semyon Varlamov. While we will continue to monitor the situation, we do not expect to take any action or have any further comment pending the resolution of those charges.'

Vavrinyuk had been dating Varlamov on and off for a year.

She described in court how her six-foot-two, 209-pound goalie boyfriend kicked her in the chest and stomped on her as she lay on the ground, before he dragged her by her hair from their bedroom in the early hours of the morning on October 30.

‘He was having fun, he was laughing,’ said the model. ‘He has no concept of when to stop drinking, and when he drinks he turns into an animal.’

She pointed to her chest, arms, stomach, neck and head - places she said she are bruised. She also said he kicked her out of the apartment, reports The Denver Post.

Vavrinyuk admitted it wasn't the first time that her boyfriend had hurt her, but throwing her out on the street was ‘the final straw.’

‘She wants to make sure he is punished for this,’ Vavrinyuk said through Diana Senova, an interpreter and the fiancee of her attorney, Robert Abrams.

‘Varlamov is very arrogant and thinks he can get away with anything, that he can beat her up and no one will ever know about it.’

She said her boyfriend had beat her at least four times before in other countries, but she had remained hopeful that he could change, as she loved him and wanted to have children with him.

She said she broke a modeling contract in Hong Kong so she could come to Denver to be with him ‘because he asked her to,’ Senova said.

According to news reports, Varlamov and Vavrinyuk, known to her friends as ‘Evie,’ have been in a rocky relationship disrupted by breakups.

His agent, Paul Theofanous, said Varlamov ‘is completely innocent of all of these charges.’

Acquired from Washington in a 2011 trade, Varlamov is 7-1 this season with a 1.76 goals-against average. Last year, the goaltender earned $3 million.

According to court documents made public on Thursday, Varlamov told Vavrinyuk in Russian that 'if this were Russia, he would have beaten her more,'

Varlamov was initially also charged with second-degree kidnapping, but that charge has been dropped.

The alleged lovers quarrel took placed on Monday at the couple’s apartment in the 1700 block of Bassett Street in Denver.

Varlamov’s arrest warrant and affidavit state that the 25-year-old athlete held his girlfriend’s face to the floor, grabbed her by her arms and shook her before pushing her down to the floor.

'Her statement is that this is the most minor of the beatings she received. She's received five in all, and the last one was to unconsciousness,' said Vavrinyuk's attorney Robert Abrams.

‘This time Evie said to us, “That’s it, go lock him up,”’ Abrams said. ‘This girl is 5-foot-3, 100-and-nothing pounds; he’s a 6-foot-2, 210-pound professional athlete. This is a very sizable force approaching you. This is terrifying.’

Varlamov’s father, Alexander, downplayed the domestic violence case and came to his son's defense in an interview with Russia's R-Sport.

'I can only say one thing with complete responsibility: No crime has been committed whatsoever,' he stated, adding that his son has ‘no serious issues.’

It has been widely speculated that Varlamov is expected to be invited as the starting goalie for the Russian Olympic team during the Winter Games in Sochi next year.

In light of his arrest, some Russian officials wasted no time accusing the United States of sabotage.

State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, called Varlamov's arrest a 'sports and political move.'

‘The main goal is to suspend him from training and games so that he loses practice and misses the Olympics,’ said Ananskikh.

The LDPR member has vowed to use his sway as the head of the Russian parliament's physical training and sports committee to 'influence the situation.'

According to the Russian tabloid Dni.ru, Varlamov and the blonde fashion model called it quits at least once before, but the woman, who resides mostly in Russia, returned to Denver for a three-month stay and moved back in with him.

In response to Varlamov's arrest, the model wrote on her Russian social media account VKontakte, which has since been deleted: 'If a man has raised his hand against a woman - he will do it again. And no amount of oaths and assurances should shake a woman's resolve.’
