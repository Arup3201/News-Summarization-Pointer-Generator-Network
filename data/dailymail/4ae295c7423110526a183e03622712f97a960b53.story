Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, sparkled in a four-strand diamond necklace studded with rubies during an appearance at a London film premiere with Prince Charles.

The Duchess cut a glamorous figure in her ruby velvet dress and diamond-studded parure, which, according to aides, was a personal gift to Camilla,  and includes a pair of drop earrings and a bracelet.

Compared to his wife, the Prince of Wales looked rather more low key, although his dapper dinner suit was enlivened with one of his signature silk pocket squares.

Beautiful: Camilla dazzled onlookers with the intricate diamond parure. She kept her rings simple

The Duchess' floor-length gown was the work of Anna Valentine, the designer who created her dove-grey wedding dress, and was teamed with an organza shawl and shimmering purple clutch.

The royal couple were joined by stars of the The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which was getting its premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square - which had been given an Indian-themed makeover for the event.

Those in attendance included Dame Judi Dench, who, seemingly inspired by the film, wore a floral print flowing robe, and Dame Maggie Smith who opted for a more low-key black and beige ensemble.

Also at the premiere was Myleene Klass who bared her shoulders in a black jumpsuit and actress Diana Hardcastle, who looked spectacular in a floor-length plum gown.

Stunning: Charles, who has made eight official visits to India, looked impressed with the decoration

Dapper: Charles was on top sartorial form in a double-breasted dinner jacket and natty silk pocket square

Colourful: Charles's attention was grabbed by the colourful garlands looped over the cinema's entrance

Spectacular: Camilla's impressive jewels resembled a £1m set given to her by the Saudi royals

The premiere was staged by the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund, which uses the annual Royal Performance - usually a premiere - as its principal fundraising event.

Charles. who has long been associated with the Fund, and Camilla joined the stars of the film on the orange carpet, which was decorated with tangerine, yellow and pink curtains, as well as long pink garlands.

So captivating was the effect, Charles' attention was momentarily diverted from his magnificently attired wife and held by the floral decorations that marked the way into the cinema. 

Both looked delighted when, as they approached the entrance to the cinema, they were given a rousing cheer by film fans. 

But thanks to her striking necklace, all eyes were on the Duchess. Camilla is said to prefer rubies, a stone that is linked with romance and has a royal history, as a result of its use in coronation rings.

Standing out: The royal couple looked relatively soberly dressed amid the spectacular garlands 

The Duchess also possesses a diamond and ruby tiara given to her great-grandmother Alice Keppel by Edward VII.

Made of gold and platinum, it is set with diamonds and, curiously, synthetic rubies, which were new and in high demand at the time.

Striking though the Duchess' appearance was, she did have some competition in the shape of the cast of the film, which read like a Who's Who of British acting.

Along with Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie, Penelope Wilton, Ronald Pickup, Diana Hardcastle and Tamsin Greig, Richard Gere also makes an appearance, as does Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel.

Is that for us? Charles beamed when film fans applauded as he and Camilla made their way into the cinema

The appearance came at the end of a busy day for Camilla, who had spent the morning visiting one of London's smallest galleries, the Fan Museum in Greenwich.

She was making her fourth visit to the museum, which opened in 1991, and was there to inspect a new exhibition called Waterloo: Life and Times.

Launched to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, the new exhibition features fans and fan leaves made to commemorate the Iron Duke's victory over Napoleon.
