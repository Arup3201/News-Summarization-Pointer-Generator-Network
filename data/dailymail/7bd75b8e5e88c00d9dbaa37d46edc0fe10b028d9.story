A controversial anti-Islamic ad campaign will appear on the side of buses in Washington D.C. featuring the face of Adolf Hitler.

The advert will be on 20 metro buses and depict a meeting between the leader of Nazi Germany and anti-Jewish Islamic leader Haj Amin al -Husseini during World War II.

The group behind the campaign, the American Freedom Defence Initiative (AFDI), say they are concerned by the 'global jihad and Islamic supremacism', with the ads calling for an end to U.S. foreign aid to Islamic countries.

The caption by the side of the contentious picture of Hitler reads: 'Islamic Jew-hatred: It's in the Quran. Two-thirds of all US aid goes to Islamic countries. Stop Racism. End all aid to Islamic countries.'

The head of the AFDI, Pamela Geller says the ads are in response to previous adverts, which featured on the city's metro buses by the American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), that were anti-Jewish.

She told the International Business Times: 'My intent is leapfrog over a media that is not even-handed, that is advancing the propaganda against the Jewish state.'

The blogger also adds that she has wide ranging support for the ad, which will run for four weeks and says she has provided information that show the claims in the adverts are true.

It is expected that the ad will start running on D.C. metro buses this week.

However, the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) has hit out the controversial campaign.

Nihad Awad, National Executive Director of CAIR told WJLA: 'This is a propaganda campaign designed to incite hatred against American Muslims, and this campaign has been based on false information, taking things out of context from the Quran.'

The organisation says it is considering the possibility of a response ad, and is offering free copies of the Quran.
