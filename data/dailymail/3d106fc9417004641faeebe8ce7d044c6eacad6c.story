Arsenal were locked in talks with Borussia Dortmund trying to agree a fee for central defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos.

The German club want £20million for the Greece international, who can also play right-back and holding midfielder.

Sportsmail first reported Arsenal's interest in the player today.

Replacement: Papastathopoulos (25) is being touted as a replacement for Thomas Vermaelen, who joined Barcelona earlier this month

The Gunners do not want to meet Dortmund's asking price and are trying to secure a reduced figure before pressing ahead with a swoop.

But manager Arsene Wenger knows he needs defensive cover before Monday's transfer deadline and is keen to land Papastathopoulos, who is understood to be open to joining Arsenal.
