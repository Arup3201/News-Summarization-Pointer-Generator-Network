A Wisconsin couple facing multiple animal mistreatment charges was found dead in, what authorities are calling, a murder-suicide after a fire on their farm last week.

Paula and David White, of Pleasant Prairie, were found dead in the ruins of their burned farm house after firefighters responded to the call early Thursday, March 19. Police say both died of gunshot wounds with Paula's death ruled a homicide and David's a suicide, NBC reports.

That was the day the two were set to appear in court for the conclusion of their trial on animal abuse charges, the Chicago Tribune reports. It was the first court date the couple missed since their arrests in May 2013.

Wounds: Police say both died of gunshot wounds with Paula's death ruled a homicide and David's a suicide

The couple faced several animal mistreatment charges after authorities found the carcasses of dozens of horses, 12 goats, and two cows in two mass graves on the couple's 'no kill' farm. Authorities discovered that the animals on the farm were living in horrible conditions -- many neglected and starving, Fox reports.  

Later that March day, a jury -- which didn't know of the situation -- found the couple guilty of 11 felony counts of mistreatment of animals causing death and two misdemeanor counts of providing improper shelter to animals.

Verdict: The day of the fire, a jury -- which didn't know of the situation -- found the couple guilty of 11 felony counts of mistreatment of animals causing death and two misdemeanor counts of providing improper shelter to animals

As the jury deliberated, authorities carried the bodies of the couple and a dog from the farm house -- all suffering gunshot wounds. The cause of the fire is unknown. 

Medical examiners say Paula suffered two gunshot wounds to the head and David sustained a self-inflicted wound to the head, Fox reports. .

Authorities seized several animals from the farm after the couple's arrest, including 23 horses and other animals including sheep, rabbits, chickens, ducks, cats, goats and dogs -- all have been adopted or taken to the Humane Society, the Tribune reports. 

Officers said the floor of the stalls were lined with feces and urine, CBS reports. 

Fatally Shot: Authorities say that David also fatally shot the couple's dog before turning the gun on himself

The Whites, both in their sixties, described themselves as 'hippies' running a 'no kill' farm at the property they called 'Hidden Lake Stables.' 

Justin Jackola, a film producer who founded JJProductions, filmed a documentary about the two and the farm in 2010. He told the Tribune that the Whites were very passionate about being self-sufficient and independent of the system.

In the documentary, Paula recalled admiring the farm when she was 18 years old and vowing to one day purchase it. In the early 90s, she and David did.

'I live to take care of my animals...,' Paula said in the documentary. 'It's a no kill farm, no body dies here...unless it's of old age.'

As Paula fed chickens, ducks, and a peacock in the film, she said that she has always loved animals and described herself as a 'farm kid.'

She also noted that she rarely left the farm because it had everything she needed.

Horses: Authorities reportedly found the carcasses of 55 horses at the couple's farm

David said in the film that he likes gardening, and Jackola -- who grew up down the road from the farm -- recalled David giving him three bags of vegetables he had grown on the farm, the Tribune reports.

Though the two seemed to enjoy their life on the farm, in a prophetic statement, David said their life at the property could end soon.

'It's our expectation to be forced off our property in 10 years,' he said. 

'So I spend my whole life trying to preserve the farm and then die?' he continued later, wondering how he will be remembered. 

'I look at my accomplishments and try and ask myself 'if someone looked at my life and saw these accomplishments would they consider them to be significant?''
