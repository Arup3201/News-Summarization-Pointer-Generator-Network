As if Highgate cemetery in north London with its gravestones and lonely walkways were not scary enough, now a rare species of giant spider has been discovered lurking in its lightless vaults.

Staff at London Wildlife Trust came across a population of the Meta bourneti, or orb weaver spiders, when working on a bat survey in December.

The identity of the spider, which requires darkness so total that even night is too bright for it, was confirmed by Edward Milner, Spider Recorder at the London Natural History Society.

The rare orb weaver spider spans 30 mm across - including all eight of its legs - and shuns any form of light

The spiders - among the largest found in Britain - were discovered in the vaults of the Egyptian Avenue at the cemetery.

Sometimes known as 'cave spiders', the Meta bourneti, or orb weaving spider, is found in places of complete darkness, including cellars, ice houses - and now vaults in graveyards.

But although the adult spiders shun the light, baby spiders, or spiderlings, actively seek it out.

This means that they can emerge from their dark birthplace and find new spaces to colonise.

The spider is about 30 mm across, including its legs. That makes it comparable to Tegenaria gigantea (the large spider often found in the bath) and is probably slightly larger.

The trust said that the spiders, which (including their legs) measure 30mm across, could have been living undetected in the vaults for at least 150 years.

The sealed vaults, which are designed to hold up to 12 coffins, are the perfect breeding ground for the shy spiders because they are so rarely opened, said the trust.

Egyptian Avenue is at the heart of the cemetery. It consists of 16 vaults on either side of a broad passageway, which is entered via a great arch.

The vaults were bought by individual families for their sole use.

The orb spiders are not the first rare 
species to be found at the cemetery: London Wildlife Trust said that 
researchers have found 227 other species previously unrecorded at the 
graveyard.

Highgate cemetery, with its spooky graves and monolithic structures, was created in 1836, along with other graveyards around London, in an attempt to deal with the growing problem of how to dispose of the capital's dead

Highgate is one of the seven great burial grounds created in the 1830s when London became so overcrowded that there was little room left to bury the dead.

Highgate attracted a varied clientele and over the next 20 years became one of the capital’s most fashionable cemeteries. 

It is the final resting place of notables as varied as the writers Christina Rossetti and Douglas Adams, as well as TV star Jeremy Beadle, Malcolm McLaren, who discovered the Sex Pistols, and Karl Marx.

Burials are still carried out at the cemetery, which sees up to 70 funerals a year.

Despite their alarming size, meta spiders help us by eating woodlice and small insects.

The cemetery isn't the only place the spiders have been found in Britain: researchers have found males of the species close to the ancient oak trees of Sherwood Forest, which suggests that they had made the dark, damp spaces within the trees themselves their home.

The spiders have also been found in the New Forest, as well as in Essex, Somerset and Wales. They have also been found in Europe and in Romania.

Tony Canning of the London Wildlife Trust said: 'The discovery of this important spider population in the heart of London shows just how valuable cemeteries such as Highgate can be in providing refuges for wildlife.'
