The promoter who organised the farcical Mickey Rourke boxing bout in Moscow has admitted it was simply a public relations stunt in which the star chose his own opponent.

The 'fight', which has been ridiculed around the world, saw the 62-year-old beat Sin City star beat Elliot Seymour, a 29-year-old homeless boxer from Los Angeles. 

But while he confessed that he was not expecting a 'super outstanding match', the man behind the bout Andrei Ryabinsky, denied that Seymour had thrown the fight.

PR stunt: Andrey Ryabinsky, whose promotion company World of Boxing promoted the bout between 62-year-old Rourke and 29-year-old Elliot Seymour, said the fight was simply 'a show' 

Elliot Seymour, 29, entered the fight with Mickey Rourke, 62, with a shocking professional record of losing 9-1 of his 10 previous bouts. He lost the fight (pictured above) in the second round

After defeating Seymour in the second round of Friday's fight Rourke (left, during the match and, right, after) celebrated by carrying his trainer Marvin Somodio on his shoulders and parading him around the ring

He said: 'Maybe earlier somebody thought this would be a match for the ratings? Of course, it was a show, this is obvious. What's the problem?  

'I expected to see Rourke and a show which people would like,' he said. 'But the main story was about Rourke. It is good for us, the more noise around this event the better.

He added: 'It is a sort of PR for us, and you know, there is no bad PR except an obituary. So Mickey Rourke worked 100 per cent.'

Ryabinsky, who runs a promotion outfit called World of Boxing added that he did 'not admit any guilt,' adding that he thought the fight had done well. 

'People gathered to watch Mickey Rourke and his boxing match,' he said. 'And now they are saying it was a show, we unmasked you.

Rourke's manager Vadim Kornilov said he had sparred with the 62-year-old Sin City star before the fight and that he was in 'great shape. He also helped to pick his client's opponent 

Like Elliot Seymour himself, Ryabinsky also denied the homeless pugilist had been paid to fall over in the second round of the match.

He said: 'It was not 'fixed' at all, it was a fair match. An opponent for Rourke was chosen according to his condition, age and skills, so he could compete and had a chance to win. But it was not 'fixed'.'

But he admitted that Rourke and his aides chose Seymour, who they knew from his sports club in America.

'Mickey Rourke is my friend, he asked me if we could put his match as a part of our programme that night,' said Ryabinsky who did not reveal how much money the fighters were paid for the bout. 

He added that Rourke and his Russian agent Vadim Kornilov, 'chose the opponent together.'

'Visit the website Boxrec.com where boxer profiles can be found, and Mickey Rourke's rival is presented there,' he continued. 'He is a professional boxer. Yes, he is not a good boxer, but this is a secondary question.' 

'If an ordinary man from the street meets him at the boxing ring, he will be punished. In other words, this guy is a weak boxer but he is a boxer.'

Pointing to Seymour's physique he insisted that the struggling fighter was a 'serious muscleman' and despite clear evidence to the contrary he said: 'He does not look like a homeless man at all.'

'It is clear that the boxers are not the richest guys in this world, except the stars, of course. But it is not important in this case,' he said. 'It is important that he is a professional boxer. The matter of his financial wealth is not interesting for us.

'Besides, before the match he passed a medical commission and he was officially allowed to box that night. So there is nothing to talk about here, we have done all this at a good quality level.'

Vadim Kornilov, variously described as Rourke's manager in Russia and a co-organiser of the fight, was also quick to defend the choice of Seymour as an opponent. 

'He is not the richest nor the most pathetic sportsman,' he said. 'Maybe he can be called poor, as many sportsmen of his age are. Maybe from time to time he earns some money as a sparring partner.' 

He added that having trained and sparred with Rourke he could say with confidence that the film star was in 'perfect shape.'

Another source close to the fight added that having considered Mickey's age, an opponent was chosen of a certain weight, talent and skills.

But they insisted, 'It is not correct to say that we bought a homeless 'punch bag' for Mickey. 

For his part, Seymour has also denied throwing the fight and has instead claimed that he did not have long enough to prepare for the ring.   

'The fight wasn't thrown,' he said in an earlier interview. 'I only had one month to train.'

When asked how much money he was paid for the fight, the 29-year-old California drifter pointed to a photo of $100 bills fanned out on a bed that has been posted on his Facebook page.

From the picture it appears that Seymour earned just over $3,000 for facing Rourke in the ring.

But his claims were contradicted by a source close to his family who told Mail Online Sunday that the cash-strapped vagrant was paid to fly to Moscow to make Rourke 'look good.'

'It was clearly a fixed fight,' they said. 'The whole bouncing off the ropes, hands down, punches were not landing and they were intentionally hitting each other’s gloves.

'There are people at Wild Card gym who know that Elliot’s in a really terrible situation and pretty much living on the streets, these are Mickey Rourke’s people who Elliot’s been around and known for some time.'

Revealing the sad back story of the fighter, the family source said he had been on the streets since May 2013. 

'He’s pretty much hanging out at Starbucks, very disheveled, people have taken him clothes because he just smelled horrible, he hadn’t bathed and hadn’t changed clothes for several days,' they said. 'He doesn’t have a place to live consistently if he’s doing anything he’s couch surfing.

'He spends nights in the local park. I know he crashed with friends sometimes, but he’s pretty much burned bridges with his friends.'

Alejandro Puelma, 29, the manager at the Starbucks Seymour bases himself in, also confirmed the boxer was currently homeless, adding he was well liked by staff and customers.

He said: 'He’s in here all the time, he hangs out here and comes in right when we open at 5am. I knew he was homeless. 

Ryabinsky, a vice president of the Russian Professional Boxing Federation, chose to blame Western media negative publicity.

 He said: 'Nowadays the Western media hunts for any information which would discredit Russia. 'Don't you remember how the Western press covered the Sochi Olympics?'
