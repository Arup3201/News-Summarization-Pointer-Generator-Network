Network Rail has been condemned for missing all of its punctuality targets across England and Wales – a finding that will come as little surprise to millions of regular train passengers.

The rail infrastructure firm – whose top five directors were awarded annual bonuses totalling more than £350,000 – was blamed for 61 per cent of all trains running late over the past year.

That rises to 70 per cent on the key West Coast mainline from London to Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow..

Failures by Network Rail caused trains to be delayed for millions of minutes

The rail infrastructure firm was responsible for the majority of delays on most lines, the damning new report showed

Of the 657,000 trains which ran late during the past 12 months, Network Rail was responsible for 401,000 of them, say watchdogs.

Their damning report lists a catalogue of failures from punctuality to passenger disruption and concludes that Network Rail ‘must do better’. More than 70,500 long-distance services were either cancelled or ran more than ten minutes late – putting Network Rail on track for a £75million fine.

And more than 361,000 train services in London and the South East were either cancelled or more than five minutes late last year, according to the report by the Office of Rail Regulation.

Regional services also narrowly failed to meet their punctuality targets, with 91.1 per cent on time, compared to a target of 92 per cent.

Failure: Network Rail has missed every punctuality target in England and Wales

The report comes amid anger that the top 
five Network Rail directors will be awarded annual bonuses totalling 
more than £350,000, with chief executive Sir David Higgins getting 
almost £100,000 to go with his £577,000 annual salary.

Anthony Smith, chief executive of independent watchdog Passenger Focus, 
said: ‘Passengers will be disappointed to see that Network Rail is 
failing to deliver on their top priority – performance.’

Bonus: Network Rail chief executive David Higgins is to receive £100,000 extra on top of a salary of £577,000

Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, added: ‘This is a ludicrous way to run our railways.’

Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘It is not good enough that
commuters are facing so many delayed and cancelled trains, despite 
inflation-busting fare rises and huge public investment in our railways.

'These latest figures make it all the more outrageous that Network Rail 
bosses have received massive bonuses.’

Rail minister Norman Baker said: ‘Passengers expect their trains to arrive on time but unfortunately the industry’s performance over the past year has not been good enough. The industry needs to up its game.’

The watchdog also cites failures on the length of delays, freight punctuality, and Network Rail’s ability to manage its assets, including tracks and bridges.

The report concludes bluntly: ‘Network Rail missed all of its targets for the punctuality of passenger services in England and Wales in 2012-13.

‘Levels of punctuality for passenger services in England and Wales remain below what Network Rail has been funded to achieve. The company has some catching up to do.’

The watchdog is also investigating ‘whether Network Rail did everything reasonably practicable to deliver punctuality targets for passenger services in the long-distance and London and South East sectors’.

A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘The economic times in which we live mean that alongside delivering new capacity we need to keep a constant drive for improved efficiency.’
