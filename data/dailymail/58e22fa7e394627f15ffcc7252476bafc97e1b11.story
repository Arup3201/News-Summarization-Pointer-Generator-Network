A pair of Canadian fighter jets were forced to escort a flight full of holidaymakers back to Toronto after two drunk women disrupted the Cuba-bound flight and made threats against the plane.

The two passengers, believed to be in their 20s, drank a large amount of duty free alcohol in the toilet, before setting off the smoke alarms by lighting a cigarette and getting in a fight.

They ended up making threats against the plane, which were 'considered non-credible given their condition'.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled two CF-18 fighter jets from Bagotsville, Quebec as a 'precautionary measure', diverting the Sunwing Flight 656 back to Toronto. 

A flight headed to Paris out of Miami had to be diverted to Logan Airport in Boston last night because of an unruly passenger interfering with flight crew. 

American Airlines Flight 62 flew out at around 6.40pm and was headed for Charles de Gaulle, but was back on the ground in Boston by 10pm.

Massachusetts Port Authority said state police arrested a man and charged him with interfering with a flight crew. No one was injured.

Sunwing said in a statement that it was 'reported that the passengers consumed a significant quantity of their duty free alcohol purchase in the lavatory and lit a cigarette, triggering the smoke detector alarm,' NBC News reported.

They then 'proceeded to get into a physical altercation with each other and made a threat against the aircraft, which was considered non-credible given their condition.'

NORAD said in a statement: 'Once the aircraft was safely on the ground, the Canadian fighters returned to their home base.'

The flight headed out for a second time with a new  crew to Varadero via Manzanillo, Cuba last night.

Sunwing had a similar problem at the end of last month, when another flight from Toronto had to return while en-route to Panama after threats from a passenger.
