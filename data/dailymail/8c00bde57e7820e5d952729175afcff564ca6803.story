An Indian woman has passed the 12-year milestone of her hunger strike and shows no signs of stopping.

Irom Sharmila, of Manipur in the north east of the country, is refusing to eat in protest against a law which gives armed forces the power to kill without any ramifications.

The 40-year-old is imprisoned in a secure hospital and force-fed through her nose twice a day because she refuses to eat until the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is repealed.

This act grants armed forces immunity for any actions they carry out while operating in an area affected by rebellion.

On November 2 2000 a group of soldiers from the Assam Rifles, protected by this law, shot and killed 10 civilians standing at a bus stop in Malom.

They were angry after one of Manipur's rebel groups attacked one of their patrols but the people killed in retaliation were innocent and had nothing to do with the initial incident.

Since then she will not eat, drink or even brush her teeth - causing her to be charged which attempting to commit suicide.

Incident: Malom, where 10 innocent civilians were killed by armed forces, is in the north east of India

Unrelenting: Shamila says she has not starved herself for 12 years only to relent before her demand is met

'That was a Thursday, the day I used to fast every week. I was so shocked by the massacre at Malom that I just decided to continue my fast unless the draconian law was repealed,' she told Al Jazeera.

Suicide - which her hunger strike was tantamount to - carries a prison sentence of a year - so she is imprisoned then released and then arrested again.

Known as the Iron Lady of Manipur, Sharmila holds the record for the world's longest hunger-strike.

'We are observing the spirit of Sharmila by holding a candlelit vigil,' said Sharmila's brother Singhajit on November 5, speaking to The Independent from Imphal, the capital of Manipur state.

'I last was able to see her on 9 October. She expressed to me that she would not accept any award from any organisation until her demands have been fulfilled.'

She is refusing to accept any awards for her activism - instead hoping to collect them after she is released if her strike is successful.

Her brother told local media: 'After Sharmila comes out winning, she will collect it [an award] herself.'

Over the past year authorities have stopped parts of Manipur from being covered by the act.

Sharmila, though, will not cease her hunger strike until it is removed entirely from the state.

'I fast until the AFSPA goes. I have not wasted 12 years of my life to back off. Either my people live with respect or I don't eat,' she explained.

Despite her action the issue is largely unknown among the Indian public - meaning there is no end in sight.

An expert on the north east of the country, Sanjoy Hazarika, said there had not been any change.

He explained: 'The cabinet has not even considered a proposal on this issue from the home ministry that was sent two years ago.'
