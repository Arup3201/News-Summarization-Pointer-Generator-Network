Dina Asher-Smith, the new rising star of British sprinting, laid down a thrilling marker for this month’s World Junior Championships by setting a new national junior record in a 100 metres race in Germany on Saturday.

The London teenager, running in her final competitive race before she heads off to the United States to take on the world’s best juniors in Oregon, won in an impressive 11.14sec.

Not only was it a personal best for Asher-Smith and a national age-group record, but it was also the fastest time by a junior in the world this year, marking Asher-Smith down as a genuine gold medal contender. The time was  also the fourth fastest on the British women’s all-time list.

The 18-year-old Blackheath athlete, a double gold medallist at last year’s European juniors and a member of the bronze-medal winning sprint relay team at the IAAF World Championships, had  shown she was already in sparkling form by clocking a wind-assisted 11.11sec in last month’s trials.
