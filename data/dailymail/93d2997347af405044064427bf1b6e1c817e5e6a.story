Police have launched an investigation into claims that a woman who was held at an immigration removal centre was subject to inappropriate sexual behaviour from guards. 

The 23-year-old woman alleges she had sexual contact with male guards at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire, which her lawyer said could amount to misconduct in public office. 

Harriet Wistrich of law firm Birnberg Peirce urged the Government to investigate and said consent could be an issue in the matter.

Ms Wistrich said the alleged case, involving a Roma woman who was released from the centre last March, was not an isolated one.

'The Government needs to look at what the hell is going on at Yarl's Wood, that this could happen in such a widespread abuse,' she said.

'It's not a one-off. They need to investigate the whole system there, because it has not worked.'

She said the issue was whether individuals being detained at the centre were capable of giving consent, adding: 'The problem is that it is not an environment where they are making free choices at all.

'If an officer conducts himself way outside the permitted rules of behaviour, that may amount to another offence of misconduct in public office, whether it was consensual or not, even if it is not an assault.

Ms Wistrich described the women at the centre as highly vulnerable, and said: 'These women are generally quite scared to come forward, and often they have moved or been deported before they are able to say anything. How widespread it is is difficult to know.'

She added: 'This is precisely the kind of case the Government says they are gong to remove legal aid from. It is a classic example of the Government saying they are saving money but actually, they're removing challenges to the abuse of state powers.'

Serco, which runs the centre, has denied there is a widespread issue at Yarl's Wood.

John Tolland, Serco's director at the 400-bed centre near Clapham, Bedfordshire, said: 'Serco absolutely refutes the allegations made that there is an environment at Yarl's Wood where sexual intimidation or inappropriate behaviour is in any way tolerated.

'We have strict procedures for dealing with any such complaints and they are always fully investigated.

'We expect the highest standards of behaviour from all our staff and any claims of misconduct are treated extremely seriously. 

On the occasion when an complaint of sexually inappropriate behaviour between staff and a resident was brought to our attention in 2012 the matter was properly investigated and the police were kept fully informed throughout. As a result three members of staff were dismissed.'

A Bedfordshire Police spokeswoman said: 'We received a report at the end of August from a third party. No one has been arrested in connection with this investigation, but the investigation is ongoing.'

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described the allegations as 'extremely serious and disturbing'. 

She said: 'A full and thorough investigation into these specific charges of abuse must be undertaken by the police and the Home Office immediately and testimony taken from all involved.

This kind of alleged abuse is a serious criminal offence and should be treated as such.

'The Home Office needs to tell us whether and how long it has known of these allegations and what action it has taken to bring the police in.

'And the independent UKBA inspectorate needs to review urgently the operation of outsourced centres run by private contractors such as Serco and look at the handling of allegations of abuse.

'Staff are supposed to be trained to identify if people may have been trafficked or subject to abuse so they can be given support and help. That's why allegations that staff have themselves perpetuated abuse are so disturbing, and why it is so important to get to the truth.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We take the welfare of our detainees very seriously. Detention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls, but it is vital that these are carried out with humanity and dignity, and we are committed to ensuring that this is the case.

'We expect contractors to maintain the highest standards. Any allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and, if necessary, they will be reported to the appropriate authorities, including the police.

'We operate a comprehensive complaints system for detainees who feel that they have not been treated in accordance with our published operating standards.'
