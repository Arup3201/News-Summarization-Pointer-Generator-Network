A college student is hoping to inspire others by eating bugs.

Cam Brantley-Rios, a senior at Auburn University, has committed himself to a 30-day diet that includes bugs in all of his meals.

And, being in college, this means mealworms, crickets and even cockroaches added to takeout, Chinese and Mexican food, and a lot of pizza.

The young man was inspired by the growing trend among Americans to eat bugs, which have become known as a low-fat, high-fiber source of protein.

'I don't feel like I'm being adventurous at all,' he explained to The Washington Post. 

'I'm a pretty picky eater.'

No doubt helping Brantley-Rios is the fact that the taste is not much of an issue.

'They absorb flavors pretty damn well,' he said.

'Crickets work really well with taco seasoning and lime juice, so that's been working great.' 

His very first meal was an omelette with a little avocado and some mealworms (above)

He even started his own blog to detail his experience, 30 Days of Bugs, and seven days in is very much enjoying waxworms, which he said are 'incredibly adaptive,' and protein bars made with cricket flour.

He also noted; 'For the self-conscious entomophagist, mealworms and chow mein are a great meal to eat in public.'

And his new diet already seems to be having an influence on those close to him he revealed; 'It's starting to pick up as a sort of local movement. A lot of my friends are getting curious and having dinner with me, and then their friends are getting interested.'

The best things about bugs though is how sustainable they are said Brantley-Rios, especially when compared to animal proteins. 

'I didn't realize how sustainable it is to eat bugs. And I think a lot of people don't know. I mean I knew that there were people eating worms in other countries, but I didn't know that it was a healthy thing to do -- or that people really thought they tasted good,' he admitted. "

'So that's what I'm trying to do, I guess. I just want to share the good news.'

Brantley-Rios also said has one more challenge he wants to undertake before this is all over - 'eating a couple tarantulas.'
