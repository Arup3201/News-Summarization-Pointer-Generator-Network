When Jerral Hancock came home from the Iraq war paralyzed and missing one arm, he was hailed a hero.

But despite the good will from his Mojave Desert town, his care was shockingly poor and for six months he was trapped in his mobile home, 'like a prison', when his handicapped-accessible van broke down.

After hearing of his plight, local high school students in Lancaster, Los Angeles County, decided to do something about it and have so far raised $264,000 for a new home, that will be purposely built for his needs.

Local high school students have raised $264,000 for a new handicapped-accessible home for Iraq war veteran Jerral Hancock, was lost his arm and was paralyzed while on patrol on his 21st birthday

The Lancaster High School students, pictured with Mr Hancock (center) have dubbed the fundraising effort Operation All The Way Home

The remarkable fundraising effort - which they dubbed Operation All The Way Home - began when Mr Hancock, 27, was asked to speak to Jamie Goodreau's U.S. history classes at Lancaster High School about his experiences.

They heard that he was badly burned on his 21st birthday while on patrol in Baghdad on May 29, 2007.

The tank he was driving hit an improvised explosive device that blew a hole through its armor and set 
it ablaze. A chunk of shrapnel lodged in his spine, paralyzing his legs 
so that he couldn't get out.

He was brought back to live in his mobile home but the hallways are so narrow he could not get his wheelchair through most of them, meaning he was trapped in certain rooms.

The high school chose to help him as part of their end-of-the-year 
project to honor veterans, something Goodreau's classes have chosen to 
do every year for the past 15 years.

The students were spurred into action after Mr Hancock told his story to a U.S. history class

Through yard sales and pizza nights, the group have raised more than ten times the amount they usually would

They usually raise $25,000 or $30,000 
for veterans charities and a celebratory dinner but have so far raised more than ten times that amount in just six months.

Mr Hancock, a father-of-two young children, has been astounded at the response of the teenagers.

Blueprints have been drawn up for the new handicapped-accessible house and the students plan to break ground next month.

'They gave up their last summer of high school for me,' he said.

Lancaster senior Joseph Mallyon said some people doubted the scale of their fundraising ambitions.

He said: 'We had no doubt that it could be done. Now there are some people in the community.

'You know, the older people, the people who have jobs, who go through life every day and know the harsh reality of things.

'Those people doubt us. But we just accept it and say, "Watch what we can do."'

The students raised $80,000 in just four months, mainly through yard sales, pizza nights and selling things like T-shirts and refrigerator magnets.

Inspired by their efforts, businesses in Lancaster and neighboring Palmdale began to get involed.

Big box stores are offering discounts on building supplies and construction contractor has volunteered to pitch in when the building begins.

An architectural firm provided the blueprints and a real estate agent waived her commission.

The credit union at nearby Edwards Air Force Base is kicking in money from new loans it writes.

Even the inmates at the local prison held a sale of their art work and donated the proceeds.

'It's really just amazing,' says J.D. Kennedy, a local field representative for Congressman Howard 'Buck' McKeon.

An Iraq war veteran himself, Mr Kennedy 
met Mr Hancock after he learned the former Army specialist had been 
stuck in his home when the oversized van that accommodates his 
wheelchair broke down.

Despite graduating high school in the summer, the students are continuing to fund raise for Mr Hancock

It meant he could not get the 70 miles to the nearest Veterans Affairs hospital to see a dentist to fix his teeth, which were rotting from the effects of the painkillers he must swallow each day.

Mr Kennedy's boss, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, pressed the VA to reimburse local doctors and dentists who agreed to treat Mr Hancock whether they were paid or not.

Then Ms Goodreau, who met Mr Hancock at the annual Pride of the Nation Day, invited him to tell his story to her students.

He joked that the fact the horrific incident happened on his birthday was the worst part.

'Yeah. That part really sucked,' he said.

Mr Hancock was injured just a few months before he was due to leave the military.

He had bought the mobile home near his mother's house and was due to live their with his wife, two children and their dog.

However, the couple split up and their nine-year-old son and six-year-old daughter now live with her.

Mr Hancock's mother and stepfather are now his carers.

The area of Antelope Valley, which has more veterans per capita than any other place in the country, honored Mr Hancock at public events.

With the scale of his injuries, most people assumed he had a huge support network behind time and Mr Hancock admitted he let them think that.

'I don't like to complain,' he said, adding the recurring dreams of burning to death in a tank were bad enough without revisiting them while awake.

Since Ms Goodreau's students began helping him, he said the nightmares have almost stopped as the project has given him a sense of purpose.

The fundraising effort was due to end with the summer vacation but this year's group have vowed to continue until Mr Hancock has a new roof over his head, hopefully by the middle of 2014.

Nicole Skinner, 17, who graduated in June and is now a college freshman, laughed when asked why she continues to help.

She said: 'Just look at him, man. Many people these days are complaining about their lives and you look at him and what he's been through, and he's still smiling and all.

'He's not complaining. He's just so motivating.'
