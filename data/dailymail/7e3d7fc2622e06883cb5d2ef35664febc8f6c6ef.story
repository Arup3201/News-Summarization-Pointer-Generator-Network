Only the quick thinking of a pilot averted a similar tragedy last year when a sister plane of the Germanwings jet suddenly lost altitude and nose-dived.

A Lufthansa A321 – a longer version of the A320 – unexpectedly descended 3,000ft while cruising over Pamplona, Spain, last November.

The jet, with 109 passengers and crew aboard, was at an altitude of 31,000ft when it started to lose height. The flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000ft.

The Germanwings Airbus involved in today's crash (pictured) would have received a safety warning after a sister plane suddenly lost altitude last year. In that incident, the problem was corrected by the pilot

According to the European Air Safety Agency, a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor.

The safety warning related to all Airbus A318, A319, A320 and A321 – including the Airbus A320 involved in today’s disaster.

In response, Airbus created a ‘temporary revision’ to all of the aircraft's flight manuals.

The EASA determined that the Lufthansa aircraft's Angle of Attack probes got blocked while flying between Bilbao and Munich. 

The EASA warned that in such a situation 'the flight control laws order a continuous nose down pitch rate that, in a worst case scenario, cannot be stopped with backward sidestick inputs, even in the full backward position.'

The agency added: 'This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of control of the aeroplane.' 

A similar Airbus plane to that involved in today's crash was put down in the Hudson River, New York in 2009

In that incident, the pilot managed to crash land in the river and the passengers were saved after a bird strike

The A321 involved in the previous incident is a slightly longer version of the plane involved in today's crash, carrying an extra 40 passengers.  

Germanwings today confirmed that today's downed aircraft underwent a major inspection at Lufthansa in summer 2013 while it was last checked yesterday.  

The plane that crashed was called 'Mannheim' and made its first test flight in November 1990.

It was then purchased by Lufthansa and had its first commercial flight in February 1991.

Experts said the aircraft would have been nearing the end of its commercial life after more than 24 years of service. 

Since the first version of the Airbus A320 was released in 1987, around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds.

The A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation. Worldwide, 3,606 A320s are in operation, according to Airbus.

The A320 family has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million take-offs, according to a Boeing safety analysis.

The safest part of a flight is when the plane is at cruise elevation. Just 10 per cent of fatal accidents occur at that point. In contrast, take-off and the initial climb accounts for 14 per cent of crashes, while final approach and landing accounts for 47 per cent.

The A320 is certified to fly up to 39,000ft, its maximum altitude before its rate of climb begins to erode.

However, the widely-used A320 family of aircraft have been involved in a number of crashes in the three decades they have been used, resulting in scores of deaths.

In December an Airbus A320 crashed into the Java Sea killing all 162 people on board in an as-yet unexplained incident.

The plane operated by AirAsia – owned by QPR chairman Tony Fernandes – vanished from radar screens in bad weather with initial reports suggesting it climbed so fast into a storm that it lost lift and plunged into the sea. 

One the first accident to involve one of the planes happened in the north east of France, not far from the current crash site, when an Air Inter flight came down in the Vosges mountains in 1992.

The Airbus A320-111 was on its approach to Strasbourg airport when it hit La Bloss Mountain, killing 87 of the 96 people on board.

The best-known recent incident involving the plane was when a domestic flight in the US had to put down in the Hudson River in New York.

The US Airways flight from the city's LaGuardia Airport heading for Charlotte, North Carolina when it is believed to have flown into a flock of geese.

The Airbus A320 like that involved in today's accident iS a short-haul, narrow-body airliner assembled in France, Germany and China.

Around 4,000 of the single-aisle aircraft have been built and Airbus says the plane 'sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short- to medium-haul routes'.

It typical seats around 150 passengers depending on the layout of the plane and has a cruising speed of 511mph and a range of up to 7,500 miles.

It was ranked as the world's fastest selling aircraft bewteen 2005 and 2007 when it became popular with low-cost airlines.

Captain Chesley Sullenberger was widely praised for landing the plane on the river, meaning none of the 155 people on board were seriously injured.

One of the deadliest accidents involving one of the planes was in May 2006, when Armavia flight 967 crashed into the sea near Sochi, Russia.

All 113 passengers and crew on the A320-211 died after it flew into terrible weather while approaching the southern Russian city after taking off from Yerevan, Armenia.

Six years earlier, 143 people, including two Britons, lost their lives when a Gulf Air Airbus A320-212 went down in the Gulf of Bahrain after a three-long flight from Cairo.

A number of factors were blamed for the night-time crash, including pilot error and poor training of staff.
