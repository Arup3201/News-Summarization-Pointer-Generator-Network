A great defender on the pitch, Sami Hyypia needs to find a way to protect his reputation off it. Whether he has the drive to keep on trying in his current position as Brighton’s manager is another question altogether.

For the first time in Brighton’s plummet down the Championship table, the former hero of Liverpool’s backline is considering his future.

That will certainly appeal to the significant section of the crowd chanting ‘we want Sami out’ in the second half of this baffling performance. Their anger is fuelled by a run of one win in 17 games; his own despondency came to the surface after watching his team batter a struggling side and emerge with nothing.

Asked if he would fight on, he said: ‘At the moment, straight after the game, I feel very frustrated. I think answering that kind of question I would maybe need some time. But usually I am not a quitter, I am a fighter.’

To think, this is a club that reached the play-offs in each of the past two seasons but now sits in the bottom three. Hyypia was given a vote of confidence at a board meeting on Tuesday, but for how long will that last?

Certainly, he won’t get as many chances as his side had here. They dominated possession and still managed to lose to a 15th-minute strike from Lee Gregory, plucked from Halifax Town in the summer. ‘Best 250 grand I’ve spent in my life,’ said Ian Holloway.

The booing for Hyypia started in the second half. ‘I think that is normal,’ Hyypia said. ‘Some of the fans are getting impatient. It doesn’t help.

‘I have always been prepared in my life for everything. I am prepared that I could have a car crash and never walk. In this job sometimes it is not going your way and you are in the situation. In my mind I am ready for it. (But) it is not nice at all.’

Neither has it been too cheerful at Millwall. They had one win in 15 coming in and a 5-1 battering against Middlesbrough last time out.

Here, they were happy to play the counter-puncher when they weren’t running down the clock. In Gregory, they had what Brighton apparently lacked – a man capable of putting a ball in the net.

The 26-year-old’s finish after quarter of an hour was delightful. Scott Malone, as was often the case, was the instigator with a cross that Brighton failed to clear. The ball fell for Magaye Gueye, who miscued a shot into Gregory’s path and the striker chipped David Stockdale for his fourth goal in 10 starts.

Brighton’s retaliation was to shoot on sight. Gary Gardner grazed the bar with a free-kick from 30 yards and Jake Forster-Caskey tried his luck from 25. The lack of deeper thinking was obvious.

When Bent did get an opening after a Joao Texeira throughball in the 48th minute, he shot wide. His header eight minutes later was even less effective.

Texeira also had a decent chance, as did Solly March. David Forde did not have to be at his best to keep them out; he probably did not need to resort to the time wasting that saw him booked in the second half.

‘This is a fantastic division,’ Holloway said. ‘Anybody can beat anyone. Magnificent. We showed great character. We got things wrong in our last game and it goes down to performance and believing in ourselves.

‘We managed to settle, got in front and then proved we can defend. Let’s see if we can get two in a row. Onwards and upwards.’

What next for Brighton? They are not happy in these parts and regardless of the official attendance statistics, the fans are voting with their feet.

Whether Hyypia walks with them remains to be seen.
