According to the age-old joke, the chicken crossed the road in order to get to the other side.

So does that explain why this llama was spotted strolling across a motorway bridge in Surrey?

Drivers travelling along the M25 were stunned to see the creature making its way across the bridge near the junction with the M3.

Out for a stroll: Perhaps the llama was on a day trip from Surrey's Chessington Zoo?

A photographer managed to snap the llama as it lumbered along the bridge over traffic speeding along the M25 below.

More typically found in the Andes mountains or the grasslands of South America, the sight of a llama crossing a motorway bridge in the south of England was a comical one.
