A teenager has been arrested over a brutal attack which left boxing world title hopeful Anthony Crolla in hospital with a fractured skull and broken ankle.

Police said that a 17-year-old boy is being questioned in custody on suspicion of burglary, assault and possession with intent to supply drugs in connection with the incident.

Crolla, 28, was hit over the head with a concrete slab after being attacked while chasing two people away from his neighbour's home at around 5.30pm on Tuesday in Chadderton, Greater Manchester.

Crolla had surgery on his right ankle which was broken in two places after the attack 

The likeable Mancunian fighter is said to be recovering well from his injuries in hospital.

But his long-awaited world title shot against Richard Abril on January 23 has been scrapped and his trainer Joe Gallagher is unsure whether he will even be able to box again.

The assault happened when two burglars climbed into the back garden of Crolla's neighbour and broke into the house on Halsey Close.

The pair searched the property, which was empty at the time, but left empty-handed.

Crolla was due to fight Richar Abril for the WBA lightweight title next month but that has been shelved

As they climbed back out to the garden they were spotted by the boxer, who shouted for them to stop and then gave chase when they ran.

There was a struggle and Crolla was hit over the head with what police described as a 'heavy object', causing him to fall to the floor. Both attackers left the scene.

The former British and Commonwealth champion's trainer said: 'We were so grateful for the world title opportunity but that's gone.

'Whether they can reschedule it, whether he'll get the opportunity again and whether he can even ever fight again remain to be seen but first we have to concentrate on getting Anthony back to full health.'

A 46-year-old woman has also been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs in connection with the matter.
