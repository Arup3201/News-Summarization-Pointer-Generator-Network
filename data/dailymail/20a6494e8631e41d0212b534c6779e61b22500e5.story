A girl who wouldn’t stop talking during a lesson had her mouth Sellotaped shut by a teacher.

Elise Smith, 11, was forced to sit for 15 minutes with tape stuck across her mouth as a punishment for chatting to other pupils.

The classroom humiliation ended when the science teacher realised he should not have done it and the tape was taken off her mouth.

'Chatterbox': Elise Smith, pictured left with her father Marc, had her mouth taped shut by a teacher at William Allitt School in Derbyshire because she would not stop talking

Last night Elise’s father Marc Smith 
condemned the teacher for holding his daughter up to ridicule in front 
of the class. He also lambasted the secondary school for failing to take
 tougher disciplinary measures against him.

Furious
 Mr Smith has lodged a complaint with the school, which has recently 
been placed in special measures, as well as the local education 
authority and Ofsted.

School governors have called the teacher’s actions ‘misguided’ and he is understood to have apologised to the youngster and her family - but no further disciplinary action was taken.

Mr Smith spoke out after the school was recently placed into special measures following a damning Ofsted inspection report.

He said: 'The children were all talking in class and were told to be quiet, but my daughter kept on talking. He should just have sent her out. You cannot lay a finger on children.

Elise with her parents Becky and Marc: Mr Smith, who lives in Woodville, Derbyshire, said he was angry that the teacher was never suspended and remains at the school. However, they have sent their daughter back

'I was at 
work when it happened, but my daughter told me when I got home and the 
next morning I went to the school. I was fuming.'

At
 the time of the incident, former head teacher Mike McCandless had to 
get both sides of the story and took written statements from other 
pupils at the school.

Mr Smith, who lives in Woodville, Derbyshire, said he was angry that the teacher in question was never suspended and remains at the school.

He said: 'The teacher apologised but has not been punished enough, in my opinion, because he didn’t get suspended and is still working at that school.

'I heard about teachers in another school doing it and they were suspended, so why not here?'

He said he was reluctant to send his child back to the school, but did so after she said she was missing her friends.

Jean Mead, Chairman of governors at William Allitt School, said: 'The welfare of pupils is always our top priority.

'This was a misguided action rather than a malicious one.

'It happened in December last year. It shouldn’t have taken place under any circumstances - the teacher immediately regretted his actions and apologised.

'We worked alongside the local authority to carry out a thorough investigation and appropriate action was taken.'
