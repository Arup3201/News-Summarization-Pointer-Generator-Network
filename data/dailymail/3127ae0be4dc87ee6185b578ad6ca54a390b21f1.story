As India collapsed in a clatter of wickets and a voracious England side delivered their wildly improbable victory, a crowd awash with ale and exaltation bellowed chorus upon chorus of ‘Super Moeen Ali!’

If you could preserve for posterity a single afternoon of the English sporting summer, then this astonishing occasion at Old Trafford would prove a memorable candidate.

The reconstruction of an ailing England team was already proving a stirring success, but it was in this Test match, and more precisely in the course of this golden afternoon, that promise was translated into glittering performance.

Fans favourite: Moeen Ali won the hearts of the Old Trafford support with his brilliant four-wicket haul

Hero: Ali celebrates dismissing Mahendra Singh Dhoni on a stunning day of cricket for England

Cricket has always possessed a thrilling capacity to accelerate from the mundane to the matchlessly dramatic within the space of a few moments. But rarely has that glorious quirk been so stunningly demonstrated, rarely have the odds seemed so unpromising, and rarely has the leading man carried such slender credentials.

Moeen Ali, or ‘Super Mo’ as he is now known in this part of Manchester, has shuffled almost unwillingly into the spotlight these past few weeks. He came to the side with hopes of proving himself a high-class middle order batsman. He acquired a reputation for an awareness of events far beyond the playing field with a wristband supporting the humanitarian cause in Gaza.

And, above and beyond all this, he has revealed himself to be the spinner who England had almost despaired of unearthing.

Time and again, he made the kind of timely intervention which he has been making all series. And the manner of his wickets finally buried his reputation as no more than a bits and pieces bowler.

His first success, arriving just a ball after Jimmy Anderson had made the break-through, was laced with good fortune. Drawing Cheteshwar Pujara forward, he defeated the bat and struck the pad. Umpire Rod Tucker approved the appeal, despite replay evidence that the ball was high and missing leg stump. However, India had declined the use of the review system, and the decision stood. Not that the crowd had time to waste on such minutiae, as the first celebratory chants boomed out.

That fortunate success reduced India to the rubble of 53 for three, but there was nothing lucky about Moeen’s next telling blow. Deceived by skilful flight, Ajinkya Rahane drove unconvincingly, allowing Moeen any excellent sharp return catch. At that stage, India had lost three wickets for eight runs in 18 balls, and their hopes of survival were in chaotic retreat. The crowd was captivated by the man with the bushy beard and air of modest self-effacement.

No matter that their local hero, Jimmy Anderson, despite being a shade under the weather, was playing his usual admirable part in the general rampage, Moeen was occupying centre stage in their raucous affections.

And everything he did, everything he tried, only emphasised his newly won eminence. Another cunningly teasing ball saw Ravindra Jadeja prodding forward with unwisely hard hands. Chris Jordan simply devoured the catch and India stood at 66 for six, with the last rites waiting to be read.

Throughout the day, we had heard how Hurricane Bertha was preparing to make her entrance, that chances of play were less than poor, and that the result might be held in abeyance until late on Monday, with a draw the heavy favourite. All changed, utterly.

Only MS Dhoni stood between India and a rout, but by now the script had been written. Over came Moeen’s arm, swish went Dhoni’s bat, and Gary Balance, leaping to his right, penalised the shoddy shot. At 105 for seven, the threat of Big Bertha had become all but irrelevant,

By now, it seemed that the England spinner had run out of new ways to impose himself on this extraordinary match, but he discovered a further ploy when, with India on 133, Bhuvneshwar Kumar elected to jog a second run. He was almost inviting the run out, and Moeen responded with a superb slide and a pinpoint throw.

The crowd crowed ecstatically, England converged upon the executioner in the field, and up in the radio box, Geoffrey Boycott observed: ‘There’s more brains in a pork pie.’

Jordan finished off proceedings, but by then the heavy lifting had been done. An innings and 54 runs!

It was way beyond the most optimistic expectations after an abject display at Lord’s. But the reality was blinking out from the scoreboard, and with it the information that Moeen Ali had returned figures of 13 overs, three maidens, four wickets for 39 runs.

‘Mo! Mo! Super Mo! Super Moeen Ali!’ The chant came rolling across the ground as the crowd hailed a genuinely famous victory. Half an hour after the close, with the rest of the England team celebrating in the dressing room, Moeen was down among the fans; signing scorecards, posing for pictures, enduring a few hundred back-slapping compliments.

The historians informed us that England had not won in three days since 1967.

But the man of the moment was not listening to the historians last night. He was enjoying the wonder of the moment, when a Test match was won and a new and welcome figure took his well-earned place at the high table of the English game.
