Sir  Bruce Forsyth will finally bow out of Strictly Come Dancing tonight and hand over control of the hit BBC One show to Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman.

The show’s ten million fans will see Sir Bruce say an emotional goodbye in a special sequence at the beginning of tonight’s launch show for the new series.

The veteran presenter’s surprise appearance was greeted with thundering applause from the studio audience when it was recorded at Elstree Studios on Wednesday night.

The moment the queens took over: Sir Bruce's last appearance on Strictly Come Dancing as his two successors Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly step up to the plate 

The 86-year-old star – who has presented the show since it launched in 2004 – tells fans he will be spending his Saturday nights watching the show and popping into his local bingo club.

Co-presenter Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, who replaces Sir Bruce, are carried into the studio on thrones and crowned the queens of Saturday night TV.

Minutes before recording began, Daly admitted they were terrified of falling off and revealed it could all go wrong if Winkleman looked at her the wrong way and caused her to have a fit of giggles.

Tonight’s show is going head-to-head with ITV’s The X Factor and BBC bosses have pulled out all the stops to make sure the programme is a ratings smash.

Most of the launch show’s big production numbers, including a performance by Motown legend Smokey Robinson, were filmed twice to ensure they were perfect.

Filming was conducted in strict secrecy, with all 625 members of the audience required to hand in their mobile phones.

End of an era: Good game, good game; Didn't he do well?; Keep dancing: I'm in charge; Shame; Here kitty kitty kitty, Nice to see you, to see you... nice; Higher... lower; It could still be a big night if you play your cards right; What do points make?; You get nothing for a pair; All right, my loves?; Give us a twirl... Sir Bruce was the king of catchphrases as well as light entertainment

In tonight’s show, the 15 celebrities starring in Strictly’s 12th series find out which professional dancer they are paired with.

And there are screams of delight as Judy Murray, the mother of former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, is teamed with Anton du Beke.

Before the show, Judy, 54, told The Mail on Sunday her son does not have high hopes for her during the competition, explaining: ‘He said: “Oh my God, you will be absolutely terrible,” and I fear he may be right.

‘He sent me a text from New York saying “Have you tripped yet’?”’

And MasterChef host Greg Wallace, 49, who will dance with Aliona Vilani, revealed his girlfriend had warned him she might become jealous of his dance-floor antics.

He said: ‘She is happy for me to do the show. But I don’t know quite how she feels with my arms around another woman. She knows I wouldn’t do anything. But she said: “I can’t promise I won’t be jealous.” And she added: “You would be jealous if I was with another man.”’

Wallace said his heart sank when he saw how some of the younger male contestants looked in their costumes, adding: ‘I get it. I am the fat, bald dad in this year’s show.’

Strictly’s first live shows will be screened on Friday, September 26, and Saturday, September 27.

The launch show is on BBC1 tonight at 8pm.
