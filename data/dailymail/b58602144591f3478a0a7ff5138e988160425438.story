It reveals an incredible story of water moving around the globe - from freshwater gushing from the Amazon River's mouth to an invisible seam dividing the salty Arabian Sea from the fresher waters of the Bay of Bengal.

The amazing image below was created from the first full year of surface salinity data captured by NASA's Aquarius spacecraft.

The groundbreaking maps are helping experts find out exactly how the Earth's oceans operate - and if they are changing.

Launched June 10, 2011, Aquarius is NASA's first satellite instrument specifically 
built to study the salt content of ocean surface waters.

The salinity sensor detects the 
microwave emissivity of the top approximately 1 inch (1 to 2 
centimeters) of ocean water - a physical property that varies depending 
on temperature and saltiness.

The instrument collects data in 
240-mile-wide (386 kilometers) swaths in an orbit designed to obtain a 
complete survey of global salinity of ice-free oceans every seven days.

'With a bit more than a year of data, we are seeing some surprising patterns, especially in the tropics,' said Aquarius Principal Investigator Gary Lagerloef, of Earth & Space Research in Seattle.

'We see features evolve rapidly over time.'

Researchers say one of the features 
that stands out most clearly is a large patch of highly saline water 
across the North Atlantic.

This area, the saltiest anywhere in 
the open ocean, is analogous to deserts on land, where little rainfall 
and a lot of evaporation occur.

A NASA-funded expedition, the 
Salinity Processes in the Upper ocean Regional Study (SPURS), traveled 
to the North Atlantic's saltiest spot last year to analyze the causes 
behind this high salt concentration and to validate Aquarius 
measurements.

'My conclusion after five weeks out 
at sea and analyzing five weekly maps of salinity from Aquarius while we
were there was that indeed, the patterns of salinity variation seen 
from Aquarius and by the ship were similar,' said Eric Lindstrom, NASA's
physical oceanography program scientist.

It is hoped the mission could provide data for several years.

'The Aquarius prime mission is scheduled to run for three years but there is no reason to think that the instrument could not be able to provide valuable data for much longer than that,' said Gene Carl Feldman, Aquarius project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

'The instrument has been performing flawlessly and our colleagues in Argentina are doing a fantastic job running the spacecraft, providing us a nice, stable ride.

'The first year of the Aquarius mission has mostly been about understanding how the instruments and algorithms are performing,' Feldman said.

'Now that we have overcome the major hurdles, we can really begin to focus on understanding what the data are telling us about how the ocean works, how it affects weather and climate, and what new insights we can gain by having these remarkable salinity measurements.'
