It’s no yolk - a sculptor has created the world’s smallest chocolate egg, so tiny it fits on the head of a PIN.

Micro sculptor Willard Wigan spent two weeks carefully crafting the egg, fashioned from real chocolate and wrapped in real gold foil.

It is so small, the egg is barely visible with the naked eye - and you probably wouldn’t even taste it if you ate it whole. The intricate detail on the egg can only be appreciated by looking through a super-strength microscope.

Mini egg: Willard Wigans' creation, the worlds smallest Easter egg - so tiny it fits on the head of a pin

Williard Wigan spent two weeks crafting his chocolate creation which is too small to see... and taste

The tiny egg is roughly one seventh of the size of a pin head, and sculpted from a tiny portion of a real Thornton’s easter egg.

Willard, from Birmingham, struggled to create the amazing piece - after the tiny pieces of chocolate he was using were so small they melted under the bright lights he uses to see his tiny artworks.

He was forced to resort to crafting a miniscule egg shape from a single grain of sand - before drizzling it with melted chocolate and slowly chipping away using a minute chisel made from a shard of diamond.

Willard, whose sculptures regularly sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds, said: 'Working with chocolate was a real challenge for me.

'It’s not like any material I’ve ever used before, and it was so difficult as the heat from the lamp, and even from my fingertips, kept making it melt.

'I eventually realised the only way I could get the right egg-shape was to sculpt it from sand first, and then cover it in chocolate.

'I then added a gold left around the bottom of the egg, to give it the appearance of it being unwrapped.

'I always keep striving to make smaller and smaller sculptures - and I think it’s safe to say this is the smallest Easter egg the world has ever seen.'

Willard’s incredible sculptures are 
so intricate that he has even had to learn to slow down his heart rate 
while creating them - as even the pulse in his thumb is enough to wreck 
hours of hard work.

And on more than one occasion, he has
even accidentally INHALED some of his priceless creations while putting
the final touches to them.

He added: 'I have to be really 
careful when making the sculptures - there have been occasions where 
I’ve just breathed in and whoosh - all my hard work was gone in a single
breath.

'I had to create a
special cage for the egg while I was working on it - with big sides - 
so if I accidentally blew it away, I wouldn’t have too far to look for 
it.'

Willard's other creations include a miniscule World Cup trophy and this detailed Tinkerbell
