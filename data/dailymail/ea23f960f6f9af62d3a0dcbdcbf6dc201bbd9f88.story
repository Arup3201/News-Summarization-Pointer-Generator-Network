A famous Cornwall beauty spot that was stripped of its golden sand beach last winter is ready to welcome holidaymakers again after the sand reappeared following last Wednesday's storms.

Poldhu Cove on the Lizard Peninsula took a big hit last February when it was stripped down to pebbles and shingle by storms that dragged the beautiful sand a short distance off shore.

But more bad weather turned out to be a good thing for the popular family spot because it caused hundreds of tonnes of sand to be dumped back onto the shore.

Locals are celebrating the return of the sandy beach, although they admit it will take some time before it returns to its former glory.

Ross Hocking, who owns the Poldhu Beach Cafe, said he has never seen the beach change so much in a year after winter erosion stripped it back further than he had ever remembered.

He said: 'It is unbelievable how much sand has returned over such a short period of time. 

'There is a large stone wall around the entrance of the cove and cafe and it's normally covered by the sand and has not been seen for years.

'Last winter, the entire 7ft wall was uncovered.'

Without its golden sand holidaymakers and locals were unable to fully enjoy the beach over the warm summer, but Mr Hocking believes its return is perfectly timed for the October half-term holidays.

'Although it may take some time for the beach to recover fully, I am sure that in time it will be back to how everyone remembers it - a sandy, safe beautiful cove.' 

Lead Lizard ranger Justin Whitehouse said the sand's return was good news for the beach, which is managed by the National Trust.

'It's not completely back to normal - that could take years - but from our point of view it shows that it's all a natural process.'

Beaches such as Church Cove, Gunwalloe and Praa Sands suffered the same fate during last winter's storms

He added: 'Poldhu is a closed system, which means the sand has been just off-shore. This isn't sand coming in from deep water.

'It's what we would expect, although I think it will take a few more storms to fully recover. It's so unpredictable.'

'The pool at Poldhu that formed on the beach, which became a bit yucky with algae and the lack of rainfall over the warm summer, has now disappeared.

'The river has taken a new course.'
