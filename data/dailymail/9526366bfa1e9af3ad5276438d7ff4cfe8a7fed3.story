They may be on course to meet in the quarter-finals of the World Cup, but Uruguay's striker Luis Suarez received support from a Brazilian over his biting ban.

Fred, who has been leading the line for the hosts, labelled the punishment 'very severe' and said he would like to see the Liverpool man remain at the World Cup.

Suarez was banned by FIFA for nine competitive international fixtures and from all football for four months after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini.

‘I can’t deny he made a mistake,' said Brazil striker Fred. 'But as a player and a human being, keeping in my mind that on the field players are tense and nervous I think this is a very severe penalty.

'A lot of people think it was fair but I disagree. He must be punished of course but I would really like to see Suarez in this World Cup.’

Uruguay meet Colombia in the last 16, while Brazil take on Chile, with the winners of the two ties meeting in the next round.

Luiz started the session at their base camp in Teresopolis but pulled out complaining of a tight muscle.

Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari hopes the centre half will. Be fit for the last 16 tie against Chile but brought Bayern Munich defender Dante in alongside captain Thiago Silva for the rest of the training game.

Fernandinho featured in the midfield, fuelling the theory that the Manchester City man is likely to start ahead of Tottenham's Paulinho.
