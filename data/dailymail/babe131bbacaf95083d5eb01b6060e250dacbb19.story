Cristiano Ronaldo scored Real Madrid's first goal against Liverpool on Wednesday night, and afterwards tipped his side to become the first in history to retain the Champions League.

Carlo Ancelotti's side overcame Liverpool with ruthless efficiency, and World Player of the Year Ronaldo moved one goal away from equalling Raul's all-time Champions League goalscoring record.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Ronaldo admitted: 'I'm not worried, I'm going to beat his record... whether now or another night. Lionel Messi is close too.

'It's a team win. We have nine points so 75% of the qualification is done.'

No team has ever retained the Champions League, and after a near-perfect performance at Anfield, many are predicting that Los Blancos could be the first.

Ronaldo admits it is a definite possibility: 'Why not?' he said. 'We're going to try. We know it's going to be very tough, but we're very positive. It's possible if we play like that.'

Much was said pre-match about the return of Champions League football to Merseyside, and that was not lost on the Real Madrid superstar, who netted his first goal at Anfield.

'It was special. It was my first goal at Anfield and I feel very happy, very proud. We knew before the game that Anfield is a difficult place (to come), but we played fantastic - especially in the first half - and we deserved it.' 

Carlo Ancelotti was on the receiving end of Liverpool's 2005 Champions League win while in charge of AC Milan, but on a one-sided night on Merseyside, it never looked like Liverpool would repeat the comeback so memorable in Istanbul.

In fact, the Real Madrid boss insists he was not thinking about it.

'I forgot. I know these supporters really well, and they stay close to the team. I told my players to stay focused in the second half.

Ancelotti, while speaking to Sky Sports, also admitted that he thought the game was over at half-time.

'I think so. We controlled the first 15 minutes of the second half too, and the game was over. I don't have anything to say to the players. They played well, with confidence.' 

Real Madrid stayed top of Group B with their win, moving six points clear of nearest rivals Ludogorets with three matches to play.
