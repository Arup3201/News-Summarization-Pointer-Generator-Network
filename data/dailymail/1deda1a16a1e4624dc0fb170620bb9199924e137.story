They're as classically British as black cabs or fish and chips. Now, nostalgic Britons can explore a historic exhibition dedicated to the iconic telephone phone boxes. 

It's almost 100 years since the first public phone box was opened in London and the Avoncroft museum in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, has assembled a collection of every model of phone box to have graced the British streets over the past 94 years. 

Despite being on the streets since 1920, phone boxes took some getting used to as there were fears you could catch tuberculosis from a shared handset. It was only in the late 1920s that the Government confirmed they were safe to use. Today, there are still 10,000 modern phone boxes functioning in the UK. 

The K1 Mk 234 (left) was Britain's first national kiosk in 1920 but it was installed more in rural locations than cities. In 1926 the General Post Office introduced the K2 kiosk (right). At this time, telephone boxes were still a novelty  and the 'Open Always' sign helped educate people that the kiosk could be used any time of the day or night

The K2 kiosk (left) was Britain's first red Telephone Box. It was designed by British architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, in 1926 and over the next nine years some 1,700 examples were installed, mostly in London. Just over 200 examples remain on British streets and these are given Grade II listing status by English Heritage. The K3 kiosk (right) was introduced in 1929. It was intended for use nationwide, whereas the K2 kiosk was limited to London due its cost and size

The K4 kiosk (left) was designed by the Engineering Department of the General Post Office and introduced in 1930. It used the successful design of the K2 kiosk, by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, expanded to include a post box and stamp machine. The K5 (right) never entered full-scale production. Only a small number of sample K5 kiosks were manufactured, and no trace of these kiosks remains - pictured is a modern mock up 

The K7 (left) was a revolutionary design and equally radical in the use of materials, compared to earlier kiosks. The General Post Office wanted a modern kiosk to replace the K6 and considered designs by three of Britain's leading post war designers. The K7 was produced in prototype form only and (pictured above) is a surviving example. Pictured right is the KX100 that was introduced BT, that was formed following the break-up of the GPO to form the Post Office and British Telecommunications

The inside of the old boxes are almost unrecognisable from the aluminium modern phoneboxes - with all models featuring a cigarette rest and a shelf to store telephone directories - with some even adorned with carpets and flowers by the local communities

From the early 1910s to the 1950s an estimated 500 examples were installed by the Royal Automobile Club. The club installed a number of different types, with the Hudlass sentry box (left) being one of the earliest RAC designs. Pictured right is the updated design that had a flat roof, rather than pitched one

The 'AA' sentry box (left) would have been a welcome sight for their patrolmen, offering shelter from bad weather while on the lookout for troubled motorists. The Automobile Association, usually referred to as the AA, began the introduction of a network of sentry boxes in 1912 and and by 1968 around 1,000 examples were installed. Pictured right is the Police Box was made famous by the BBC science-fiction series 'Doctor Who', which first appeared on British television in 1963

The K2, K3 and K6 were designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. 

He was born on 9 November 1880 and came from a famous family of architects.

Sir Giles Gilbert Scott produced iconic designs in Britain including those for Liverpool Cathedral, Waterloo Bridge and Battersea Power Station. 

His design for Liverpool Cathedral was submitted in 1903, when he was just twenty-two years old. Knighted by King George V on 22 July 1924, he died on 8 February 1960.

Red was a highly visible colour. The General Post Office's pillar boxes were already painted red so the choice of colour was an obvious decision. 

Originally Scott had intended his kiosks to be painted silver, with a 'greeny-blue' interior; but for the internal workings of the Post Office Britain might never have had a Red Telephone Box.

The Police Box was made famous by the BBC science-fiction series 'Doctor Who', which first appeared on British television in 1963. 

The Time Lord - the Doctor - travelled through time and space in a Tardis. 

In the series, the Tardis was meant to adapt and blend into its surroundings, but a fault left it frozen in the form of a Police Box. 

Through the fifty years of the television series, the Police Box has become internationally recognised, yet only around 1,000 examples were installed.

The blue police boxes were once commonplace on British streets, but now just a handful remain - mostly in Glasgow. 

For short periods of time, the boxes were even used to lock up criminals.
