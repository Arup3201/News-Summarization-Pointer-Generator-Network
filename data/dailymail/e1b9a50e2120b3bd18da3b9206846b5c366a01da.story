The mental health of acne sufferers must be taken 'far more seriously', an expert has today warned, as it emerged a fifth of people with the condition have contemplated suicide.

New research has revealed the impact the common skin condition has on self-esteem and confidence.

More than half of sufferers (56 per cent) have been the victim of verbal abuse from friends and family, while one in five blame the condition for the breakdown of a relationship.

The survey, commissioned by the British Skin Foundation, also reveals 10 per cent of people living with the condition believe they were unfairly dismissed from their job because of their acne.

A new survey by the British Skin Foundation found one in five of the 2,299 respondents had contemplated suicide as a result of their condition. More than half said they had been the victim of verbal abuse at the hands of their friends and family (file picture posed by model) 

The condition is caused by a combination of comedones - blackheads and whiteheads - and pus-filled spots, or pustules.

Those afflicted  usually notice the first signs during puberty.

The severity can range from a few spots on the face, neck, back and chest to a more serious problem that can cause scarring and impact on a person's self confidence. 

The BSF survey revealed 20 per cent of the 2,299 respondents have have thought about or attempted suicide because of their condition.

That statistics, experts say, highlights the extreme consequences the condition can have on a sufferer's mental health, confidence and self-worth.

Consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokeswoman, Dr Anjali Mahto said: 'I'm not surprised to hear that acne can have such a profound effect on every aspect of someone's life.

'What is really sad about it, is that acne, for the majority of people is a treatable skin disorder, and having suffered with it myself, I really do feel that no one should just have to live with it. 

'A good dermatologist can offer a large number of potential treatments that can be tailored to the individual. 

'Unfortunately, the skin is such a visible organ, that it's only natural that self-esteem is so closely tied to it.

'People do underestimate acne and the impact it has on those suffering with it. 

'I think these results highlight that acne should be taken far more seriously.

'It is important to seek help and advice early before scarring (be that mental or physical) develops and request referral to a dermatologist if treatments aren't working. 

'We also need to investigate the psychological burden of this further.'

The research, the biggest survey conducted by BSF, aimed to get an insight into what acne sufferers go through during their everyday lives.

A spokesman for the charity said the condition is often 'overlooked' adding the foundation is 'here to help change that'.

While most people will 'grow out' of acne by the time they reach their 20s, it is normal for a person to suffer the condition for longer.

The BSF spokesman added: 'Aside from the visual symptoms of acne, it's important not to trivialise the emotional impact of the disease.

'Being a very visual condition, acne can have a huge impact on a person's self-esteem and confidence, bringing with it potential long-term effects on the sufferers' life.

'This can be anything from relationships, work or state of mind.' 

One anonymous responder told BSF: 'I suffer from acne, it's an awful thing to go through.

'I think we need more awareness. It's not just a spot on someone's body, it affects everything about them - well for me it does.

'I'm trying to get control of mine now, it's still all over my face, scars, spots but day by day, I'm getting there.' 

And another participant, added: 'I am over 60 and I do not think that it will ever go away. I have had it since I was about 10.'
