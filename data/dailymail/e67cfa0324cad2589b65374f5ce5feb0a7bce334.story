Using the loo means a trip to the dunes, and the only shower is in a communal block - but for house-hunters looking for a back to basics bolthole, these seaside huts could be a perfect fit.

The five tiny beach huts, all without a bathroom or mains electricity, sit on Mudeford Spit, near Christchurch, Dorset, which is so remote it can only be reached by ferry or a novelty train.

But those looking to escape the stress of the city will need to have more than a little spare change. The huts are on the market for up to £240,000 - as much as a spacious family home in other parts of the country.

Back to basics: Six people can squeeze into the hut for an overnight stay on two single sofa beds (pictured), bunks and a mezzanine level

With an asking price of £240,000, hut 145 is the most expensive one on the market. At just 15ft by 10ft, the property costs the equivalent of £1,6000 per square foot - a similar rate to a beachfront mansion in exclusive Sandbanks in nearby Poole.  

And for the same amount, potential buyers could snap up a five-bedroom home in Liskeard, Cornwall - or splash out on a Ferrari F12 Berlinetta.

The property, which boasts picturesque views across to the Isle of Wight, can sleep up to eight people packed into two single sofa beds, fitted bunks and a separate mezzanine sleeping area. 

It is one of three that is being marketed by Denisons Estate Agents. The firm is also offering hut 224, which looks over the harbour, for £225,000, and hut 131, whose more restricted view gives it a more affordable £185,000 price tag. 

The huts’ electricity comes via solar panels on the roof which power the lighting, while the kitchen area has a cooker and small fridge which run off a cylinder of camping gas.

The other two huts for sale are being sold privately by the owners, both for £200,000. Hut 78 has a harbour view and sleeps four and hut 335 has interrupted beach views.

Buyers can only sleep at the huts between March and October, although they can visit any time of year. Last July a 18ft by 12ft hut at Mudeford became Britain's most expensive beach hut when it went on the market for £270,000.

Escape the city: This sky-blue hut, number 224, is on the market for £225,000 and offers beautiful views over Christchurch Harbour

Compact: The wooden living area of hut 224 incorporates a kitchen which offers a cooker and small fridge that run off a camping gas bottle

Tight squeeze: The mezzanine level of hut 224, pictured above, offers guests another option for an overnight stay during the summer months

More affordable: Restricted views of the sea mean hut 131, pictured centre, comes with a £185,000 price tag - making it cheaper than average

Sought-after: The interior of hut 131 is bright and airy and offers a relaxed way of life to those looking to escape the stress of city living

Buyers will also have to shell out between £2,500 and £4,000 a year in ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council on top of the cost of a hut and pay a £15,000 transfer fee when they want to sell it. 

As beach huts are not classified as residential properties, buyers are exempt from paying stamp duty.

This cuts thousands of pounds of the overall costs as 2 per cent stamp duty is paid on properties costing up to £250,000.

But beach hut-owners are not spared all extra costs. 

Those who own beach huts on Mudeford Spit have to pay Christchurch Borough Council between £2,500 and £4,000 a year in ground rent. 

While anyone looking to sell has to pay a £15,000 transfer fee when it changes hands. 

Andy Denison, from Denisons Estate Agents, said January was a popular time of the year to sell the huts as, just as when booking holidays, would-be buyers often think about their summer plans now.

He said: 'A million pounds does sound quite a lot just for five beach huts, but that does reflect how sought-after they are. It is not just a beach hut, it is a lifestyle you are buying into as well.

'It's a busy time of year for beach huts, people are starting to think about their summer plans.

'It's not that much different from travel companies starting to advertise their holidays now. It's something that has snowballed over the last few years.

'They do seem to be fetching around the £200,000-mark now and there are rumours of them going higher than that.

'It's very difficult for us to value the huts, it's governed a lot by location - whether you have that fabulous sea view - although some poeple prefer the harbour side, that's got it's own micro-climate.

'But size and condition come into it too.

'It seems like a lot of money but people are willing to pay that, even though they've still got to rent the land from the council as well.

'I think people just really want to be part of the community. It's quite a rare thing.

'Some people will spend six weeks at their beach hut for the summer holidays, getting into that way of life.

'It's a beautiful part of the world and has some of the nicest beaches. It's not an easy journey for the day so it tends to be quieter than Bournemouth or Southbourne.'

In demand: One estate agent said that beach huts in the area tend to fetch around £200,000, adding that prices could rise even higher

Stunning: Hut 335, pictured right, offers uninterrupted sea views. It is being sold privately by the owner and is on the market for £200,000

Worth the cost: Hut 145, which has no bathroom or mains electricity, does offer the owner stunning views across to the Isle of Wight, above
