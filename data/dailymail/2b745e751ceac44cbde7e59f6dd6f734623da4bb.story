Nigel Farage has written to all 59 Scottish MPs, calling on them to stop voting on English-only issues with immediate effect.

In an attempt to seize the agenda on equal powers for England, the Ukip leader said he did not believe David Cameron wanted to ‘seriously address’ the issue.

Mr Farage said he supported devolution across the United Kingdom, but warned sweeping powers could not be extended to Scotland without a ‘fair’ settlement for England.

He also hit out at the financial settlement, known as the Barnett Formula, which means taxpayers in England subsidise those north of the border.

Tories fear Ukip could make capital out of any perception that England will lose out if Scotland gains the power to set its own spending, taxes and welfare policy – or so-called devo max – in return for staying in the UK, ahead of a potentially damaging by-election in Clacton next month.

Ukip is tipped to win its first Westminster seat in the Essex town in a contest triggered by the defection of Eurosceptic former Conservative MP Douglas Carswell.

Mr Cameron and the other party leaders have vowed to allow Scotland to keep the Barnett Formula in perpetuity – which means the amount of money given by the Treasury to Scotland works out at £1,600 a head more than England.

Mr Farage said yesterday that Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband had ‘panicked’ in making generous promises to the Scottish government, on behalf of English taxpayers, after a ‘lacklustre’ start to the referendum campaign.

‘I’m happy for powers to go to Scotland provided the same privileges and powers are enjoyed by England too and I’m not convinced by what I’ve seen from Mr Cameron that he seriously wants to address that,’ Mr Farage said.

‘The English are 86 per cent by population of this Union. They’ve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. We still have a situation where Scottish MPs can vote in the House of Commons on English-only issues. I think what most English people want is a fair settlement.’

He suggested having days in the Palace of Westminster when Scottish, Welsh and Irish MPs do not attend – effectively an English parliament but without a new building. 

But he added: ‘I’m going to write today to all 59 Scottish MPs and I’m going to say to them in the spirit of finding a fair settlement for the United Kingdom, will you please commit from today not to take part in debates or votes in Westminster on English devolved issues.’

In the longer term, he called for a constitutional convention to find a way forward, adding: ‘That process is vital. Mr Cameron this morning, as a last-minute measure yet again, has decided to put William Hague in charge of a committee to try to cobble together a solution … I think we need a proper, open debate.’

Former minister Owen Paterson said people would see it as ‘unfair’ that Scottish politicians would continue to vote on taxes raised only in England.

Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said he was ‘mightily relieved’ Scotland had voted No, but urged Mr Cameron to engage with MPs on the ‘English question’, saying: ‘You can hear Alex Salmond teeing things up for the next row with Westminster because we’ve really no idea what these promises of extra powers actually are or what is meant by honouring the Barnett Formula.’

Ukip’s annual conference next week is expected to attract hundreds of new recruits.

A party source said: ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if Nigel mentions English devolution in his conference speech, it’s a big issue. The conference will be a call to arms before Clacton.’
