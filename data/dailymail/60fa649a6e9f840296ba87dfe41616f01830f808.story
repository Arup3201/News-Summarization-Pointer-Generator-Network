Heartbreak: Pensioner Donald Bennett, 83, died after being crushed by a police van while eating an ice cream in Pudsey, West Yorkshire

A police officer has been suspended from driving duties after a great grandfather was killed when a van rolled into him.

Relatives today paid tribute to Donald Bennett, 83, who was crushed to death when it is alleged the officer left the handbrake off in Pudsey Park, West Yorkshire.

Speaking from Australia, Adam Cash said: 'I miss my great-granddad already from the other side of the world.'

Another grandson, Richard Bennett, added: 'RIP granddad, miss you so much already.'

Mr Bennett was killed when officers from West Yorkshire Police parked their Vauxhall van at the top of a slope while investigating an incident involving a gang of youths.

But, it is believed the driver left the handbrake off and it rolled forward crushing Mr Bennett.

The accident, which happened in 
Pudsey, West Yorkshire, on Saturday afternoon, has been referred to the 
Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Mr Bennett, who 
lived nearby with his wife Marjorie, 83, had been driven by his son to 
enjoy the sunshine in Pudsey Park, which was packed with families.

Floral tributes from his family, 
including Mr Bennett's grandchildren, mark the spot close to the park 
gates where the pensioner was killed.

Richard
Brook, who lives a few streets from Mr Bennett's home said the community was stunned and saddened by his death.

'We heard about it on Saturday night,' he said. 'We were shocked, especially for it to happen in a park like this.

'He was actually watching the bowls with his son and he came up here to this end of the park for an ice cream, as far as I know.

'I'd see him walking around near his home and he seemed like a nice bloke.

'I can't see how this could have happened.'

Mrs Bennett is being consoled at 
home by relatives.

A family member, who asked not to be named,
said: ‘It is all very shocking and sad. He was a loving grandfather.’

Dog walker Barry Smith described what
happened after the PC and WPC arrived in their van. ‘They jumped out to
go and speak to the young lads who were being a nuisance and they left 
the handbrake off,’ he said.

‘The van rolled forward and crushed Mr Bennett to death.

‘He couldn’t move because he needed two walking sticks to get around because he’d just come out of hospital after an operation.’

Neighbours said Mr Bennett
was well known locally and was affectionately called ‘Donald Duck’ by 
children in the area.

‘Donald was such a lovely man, and 
would always go the extra mile for anyone despite his age,’ said one, 
who asked not to be named.

‘He loved going out on walks – he was always smiling.

‘He used to stop and talk to children around here when they were with their parents and childminders.

‘When the news filtered through, it deeply shocked everybody. We’re all saddened and stunned.’

Two police officers had been called to the scene after complaints of youths in the area

Mr Bennett is understood to have been a former president of Pudsey Liberal Club.

The club expressed its grief and passed on its condolences to Mr Bennett's relatives following the tragedy.

Club
steward Andy Chappell said: 'The club, its members, committee and staff
all give their condolences to his family at this very sad time.

'It's
a sad loss. I wasn't here when he was president but one of my staff 
members remembers him as a good man who did a lot for the club.'

In a statement, the IPCC 
said: 'The force referred the incident, which happened on Saturday at 
about 2.15pm to the IPCC and an IPCC investigator was sent to the scene.

'An independent IPCC investigation was launched shortly afterwards.'
