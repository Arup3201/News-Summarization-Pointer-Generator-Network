A row has broken out after a Miss Birmingham beauty queen was forced to share her title - with another woman who won an identically-named gong three months later.

Construction worker Katie Stamps, 21,  swapped her hard hat for a tiara to accept the prize organised by Miss England, the organisation whose winners go on to enter Miss World.

But she must now share the Miss Birmingham name with 26-year-old Kris'ina Jagpal, who won it on Thursday from a rival organisation called Miss Great Britain.

Katie said she 'cannot believe something like this would come to jeopardise all the hard work' that she put in

The Miss Great Britain camp insist the city is big for the two of them, but Katie and Miss England's organisers said they were furious.

Katie, from Kidderminster, said: 'Since winning the Miss Birmingham title I have put my all into representing the city and to change perceptions of what a beauty pageant means.

'With charitable and intelligent girls such as the Miss England finalists I met, I cannot believe something like this would come to jeopardise all the hard work.'

Miss England regional director Rachael Barker has now declared she wants to challenge the decision at the High Court.

'I am livid,' she said. 'We could not afford the £25,000 to challenge this through the courts.

'They have no right to use the term, but unless we take them through the High Court in a costly battle we can't do anything.'

She added the row has resulted in widespread confusion among would-be entrants.

'I had Katie on the phone utterly confused, asking if she's still Miss Birmingham,' she added.

Kris'ina, from Edgbaston, Birmingham, won her Miss Birmingham crown at a ceremony in Leicester last week.

She was a previous winner of the rival Miss England-arranged title in 2012, but later switched to the competition organised by Miss Great Britain. 

The beauty queen, who made headlines last week when she revealed she is marrying former Mr Birmingham Eli Coley, said she was taken aback by the reaction.

Match made in heaven: Kris'ina, who met her husband-to-be on a wedding shoot where they were both models (pictured), said she had no problem sharing the role and the city was big enough for two Miss Birminghams

'When you win a pageant the last thing you want is all this,' she said. 'I was shocked to be honest. I'm a nice person, I get along with everybody.

'I'm happy to work with another Miss Birmingham.' 

Kate Solomons, the national director for Miss Great Britain, insisted there was nothing stopping her from holding the competition - and it was not the first time there had been two Miss Birminghams.

She told MailOnline she would be happy to fight in the High Court over the brand.

'I came second in Miss England in 2004 and was an organiser for seven years before being headhunted to join Miss Great Britain, so I know the rules,' she said.

'Our competition is very inclusive. There's lots of pageants out there and the girls should be able to enter whatever they like.

'Miss England like to see themselves as an exclusive competition and they're very well recognised but Miss Great Britain has been around since 1945. I don't think they have any authority over the regional title.'
