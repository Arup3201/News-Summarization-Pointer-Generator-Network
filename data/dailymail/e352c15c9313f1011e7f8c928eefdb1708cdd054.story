Apple's iPhone 6 will monitor exactly how far its owner walks each day - and even how much caffeine they drink.

The latest test version of Apple's new Health app adds to the blood pressure, temperature and pulse monitoring features shown off by Apple earlier this year.

The app called HealthKit even offers the ability to send data to your family doctor.

Apple's iPhone will track everything from sleep to calories - and even how much caffeine you drink

‘Developers have created a vast array of healthcare devices,’ said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering. ‘But until now, the information lives in silos.’

The firm is working with dozens of medical firms so that doctors can see a patient's data - and even get an alert if something is wrong.

'You choose what you want shared. For example, you can allow the data from your blood pressure app to be automatically shared with your doctor,' Apple said.

It will rely on additional equipment, such as a wrist-strap  heart monitor that connects wirelessly to the iPhone.

It is not yet known how the app will track caffeine - and could rely on users telling it how much they drink.

Expert say the move could make it easier for new owners to start tracking their health.

'Adding on-device tracking support to the Health app is a significant addition from Apple as iPhone 5s (and future iPhone) customers will no longer even need to integrate any App Store apps or hardware devices to begin using the software,' said Mark Gurman of 9to5mac.

'Steps is one of the more mainstream categories of fitness data, so the ability for the iPhone to provide that data out of the box is a great way to teach people about the Health fitness tracking software.

The new Health App will use a special dashboard to show user's exactly how their health is - and can alert doctors if something is wrong

The apphas sections that can track data for bloodwork, heart rate, hydration, blood pressure, physical activity, nutrition, blood sugar, sleep, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and weight.

Apple is  currently be testing the Healthbook software with iOS 8, the next version of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch operating system.

Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said a key feature of the app was its ability to send an automatic alert to a doctor if vital signs approach dangerous levels.

It comes as iPhone maker Foxconn has revealed Apple's new iPhone 6 could be the first to be made using its 'robot army'.

The firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and CEO Terry Gou has revealed the robots, dubbed 'Foxbots', are in the final stages of testing.

It is believed Foxconn will install 10,000 robots as a test.

Workers are seen inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province. The firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build Apple's latest iPhone.

Lines dedicated to Apple devices getting first priority, according to IT Home.

It says Gou told a shareholder meeting that Apple would be the first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that its next product - the iPhone 6 - will be manufactured in this way.

Each $25,000 Foxbot can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year it has been claimed.

Foxconn, which currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across China.

However, the firm's robot initiative has been delayed since it was first announced in 2011.

At the time, Gou said the company had about 10,000 units already in operation, a number that was supposed to rise to 300,000 in 2012, then one million by 2014.

An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side

However, the firm is also ramping up human workers for the iPhone 6, with 100,00 being hired according to some reports.

Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6.

They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back.

However, a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen.
