Donald and Isobel Grist after the war. They kept their hope up by imagining their dream cottage while interred in a PoW camp

An English couple's dream of an idyllic
country cottage kept them alive during three years apart in a hellish World War
II prison camp, their recently discovered letters reveal.

And after Donald and Isobel Grist's
nightmare existence in the Japanese jail came to an end in 1945, one of the
first things they did was turn their dream into reality.

The married couple risked execution by
secretly exchanging poignant letters to each other to keep their spirits up in
the notorious Changi PoW camp.

Mrs Grist nearly died from malnutrition and
disease in the horrific conditions and was even given the last rites by a
priest at one stage.

Apart from the prospect of seeing each other
again, the one thing that kept them going was the hope of living in a quaint and
quiet home back in England.

Their grandson Joseph Bampton unearthed the
story after he was given the letters and about 20 watercolours his late grandmother painted during her life in the camp before his mother died in January.

They have come to public light after he took
them along to TV's Antiques Roadshow in Devon.

In one letter to her husband dated June 2,
1944, Mrs Grist, then aged 54, wrote: 'For the first 18 months in jail I
thought - oh for a house, garden and seclusion.'

Upon returning to England and back to good
health, they bought a remote thatched cottage in the Suffolk village of Stoke by
Nayland and lived there happily for the next 20 years.

Mr Bampton, 66, from Wells, Somerset, said: 'My grandparents were middle-aged and living and working in Kuala Lumpur when
they were taken by the Japanese in 1942.

'They were separated in Changi Jail and had
little contact with each other during that time.

'Their only communication was these tiny
little notes that had to be folded up into small pieces and passed to each
other through friendly guards or people who were going from section to section.

'This idyllic cottage was mentioned often
between them and I am sure having that focus kept them going.

'My grandmother was a townie-type of person
but after spending so long surrounded by so many people, she and my grandfather
wanted isolation and seclusion.

'I recall spending my summer holidays there
as a child and it was so perfect, it was beautiful. They bought it in 1947 and
it had three and a half acres.'

Donald Grist (seen above, after the war) was working as an agricultural 
chemist in the Far East when the Japanese took Malaya in 1942. In her letters, Isobel is known as Vimmy. She is seen here in 1961

The couple managed to hide the appalling conditions from their worried families back in England, as this letter shows (RedX referring to the Red Cross)

Mr Grist was working as an agricultural
chemist in the Far East when the Japanese took Malaya in 1942.

The couple were imprisoned at Changi Jail in
Singapore where conditions were horrendous, with 5,000 people packed into a
prison meant for 600.

In one letter sent to her husband, Mrs Grist
wrote how 13 women where sharing a room that measured just 3ft 3in by 6ft.

They existed on a diet of one bowl of rice
and a pint of water a day and by the end of the war, their bodies were almost
skeletal.

Bizarrely, Mr Grist went on to become a
world authority on the subject of rice after becoming fascinated by how it
could sustain humans for so long.

In one letter to her husband Mrs Grist, who
was known as Vimmy, wrote: 'Dear old granny, writing every week since June 13th
1943 when she first heard of you.

'What can our home folk think. In a way I am
glad that the Red X (Red Cross) have been misled and our true conditions of living
and housing have not been revealed. They would have worried so much.

'I am finding the heat and sun very tiring
indeed and I shall be burnt black before long.'

Mr Bampton said: 'When they came back to the
UK, my grandparents were put in hospitals to recover because they came out as
skeletons.

'My grandmother suffered from dysentery
three times and my grandfather caught malaria.'

Further news was spread around the camp by resourceful inmates who put together the 'Changi Guardian' after somehow getting hold of a typewriter.

The Grists had two children, Isobel and
Howard, before they moved to Malaya.

Mrs Grist died aged 94 in 1985 and her
husband died a year later at the age of 95.
