Jurors in the Max Clifford trial were sent home for Easter yesterday after spending three days deliberating without reaching a verdict.

Judge Anthony Leonard QC told them to go home for the Easter break and try to put the case out of their minds.

He also warned the jury to ignore other recent high-profile sexual assault cases.

The jury in the trial of Max Clifford has been sent home for Easter after deliberating for three days

Earlier, the jury in the trial dropped down to ten members.

The judge discharged a female juror who did not attend court and another was sent home in the first half of the trial because she knew one of the witnesses.

In his closing remarks to the jury, Clifford's QC, Richard Horwell rubbished suggestions the publicist was a 'sexual predator'.

He
 said Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst would be spinning in her 
grave at the prosecution portraying women of the Sixties and Seventies 
as 'as lacking in all resolve'.

Mr Howell accused Clifford's accusers of making up the allegations and telling their family and friends about them.

But Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, 
urged the jury not to be fooled by the kiss and tell agent. She branded 
him a 'risk taker prepared for some danger' who indecently assaulted a 
string of teenagers over 20 years.

She
 asked them why so many women - who do not know each other - would make 
complaints of such 'similarity', and why they would have confided in 
friends many years ago, unless they were telling the truth.

Mr Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, faces 11 indecent assault charges against seven alleged victims.

The 71-year-old publicist, has denied all charges.
