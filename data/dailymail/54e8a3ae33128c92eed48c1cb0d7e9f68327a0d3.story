Photographer Andy Lee has captured a series of haunting images showing some of the world’s most breath-taking roads, including the Snaelfellsnes Peninsula in Iceland

The avenue of beech trees, which was used as the location for the King's Road in the HBO series, was planted by the Stuart family in the eighteenth century.

It was intended as a compelling landscape feature to impress visitors as they approached the entrance to their Georgian mansion, Gracehill House.

Two centuries later, the trees have become one of the most photographed natural phenomena in Northern Ireland.

The 100km-long Snaefellsnes Peninsula features fjords, volcanic peaks and dramatic sea cliffs.

The area is crowned by the glistening ice cap Snæfellsjökull, and was immortalised in Jules Verne’s fantasy tale, Journey to the Centre of the Earth.

His latest series of work, which also includes images of Pembrokeshire in Wales and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, is simply titled: ‘Roads’.

Talking about the inspiration for his work, Lee says: ‘Getting lost is half the fun’. This shot was captured in West Iceland

Photographer Andy Lee started taking pictures seriously around ten years ago when he was filming a documentary for a charity in Ethiopia

Talking about the inspiration for his work, Lee says: ‘Getting lost is half the fun’. 

He continues by quoting a line from Jack Kerouac’s famous novel, On the Road, saying: ‘There was nowhere to go but everywhere'.

He adds: ‘I've been taking pictures most of my life, but started it a little more obsessively about ten years ago when I was filming a documentary for a charity in Ethiopia.

Mr Lee's images are accompanied by a quote from Jack Kerouac’s famous novel, On the Road: ‘There was nowhere to go but everywhere'

‘I had an old Hasselblad film camera with me and between scenes I started to photograph everything around me.

‘From that moment on I was hooked. The joy I still get from seeing an image projected onto ground glass, or the smell of developer is enough to keep me shooting with a smile on my face.

‘I love portraiture, though more recently I have started to enjoy photographing landscape. Combining the two is something I hope to develop even more.’
