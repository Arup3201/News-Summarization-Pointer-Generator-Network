This is the dramatic moment two fishermen are forced to abandon their sinking vessel and jump into the freezing Irish Sea.

Crew on board The Tribute spotted Snowdonia beginning to tip ahead of them as the two boats sailed approximately 12 miles east of Kilkeel Harbour, on the County Down coast.

As the Tribute gets closer they can see the damaged boat lift almost vertically and in a matter of seconds begin to disappear below the water, as two fishermen cling to the side of it.

Fishermen 12 miles east of Kilkeel Harbour, on the County Down coast, gather at the front of the vessel The Tribute and look on in horror as a boat named Snowdonia begins to tip in front of them

As The Tribute gets closer they can see the damaged boat lift further and then rapidly sink as the two fisherman, wearing red, can be seen clinging to the right-hand side of the boat

The two fisherman are forced to abandon the ship and swim away quickly as their vessel becomes almost vertical and continues to plunge into the sea

But as Snowdonia hurtles towards the seabed, the two fishermen have no option but to escape into the icy waters where they battle to stay afloat.

One of the men is spotted briefly dipping below the water but thankfully emerges a few seconds later as their approaching rescuers look on in horror.

The video, which begins with the rescuers scrambling towards the front of the boat to watch the dramatic events unfold, ends when the Tribute gets close enough to pull the men to safety.

Throughout the one minute clip the crew can be heard shouting messages to 
their captain.

One of the men is seen swimming towards a life ring in desperation but turns in horror to see the trawler Snowdonia disappearing below the water

The dramatic footage shows the moment the boat completely submerges and the two fisherman can just be seen scrambling out of harm's way while their belongings sink around them     

One of the fishermen is forced under the water by the ferocious waves caused by the sinking while the other man manages to remain afloat 

The Belfast Coastguard were alerted to the sinking by Tribute, whose crew looked after the men until the RNLI lifeboat arrived from Kilkeel.

Medical staff from the lifeboat treated the two men until the Irish Coast Guard Search and Rescue helicopter arrived and airlifted them to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.

Following the rescue last Tuesday, Gary Young, from the Belfast Coastguard, said: 'This incident has again proved the importance of wearing a lifejacket and having it maintained to a high standard.

'I would like to pass on my thanks to the professionalism of the lifeboat and helicopter crews.'

Thankfully he reappears moments later and the pair are rescued by the approaching vessel, The Tribute, where the dramatic event was filmed from
