Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock fully expects to go up against a strong Liverpool side in London on Sunday despite the Reds' recent struggles.

Liverpool are travelling to Selhurst Park in the midst of a three-match losing streak in all competitions.

Brendan Rodgers' side last won in the league in a 3-2 triumph at QPR on October 19 and have collected just one point since.

Goals have been in short supply this season for the Merseysiders since the departure of striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

Daniel Sturridge is the only striker to have hit the back of the net for Liverpool in the league this season.

'I wish I had their problems,' Warnock said. 'They have world-class players in every position.

'You just have to look at the strikers they have, two of them I quite like myself.

'I think (Mario) Balotelli is a fantastic player, Rickie (Lambert) is good, too. They have different qualities.'

Palace, meanwhile, have lost four of their last five league games, including a 1-0 defeat at Manchester United before the international break.

Warnock is hoping his side can rise to the occasion and clinch their first win since a 2-0 triumph at home to Leicester on September 27, their only league victory at Selhurst Park so far.

'We know we are going to have to play extremely well,' Warnock said. 'I just want us to cause them problems.

'It's going to be a great game. They have very good players and it's another opportunity for us to prove ourselves against a strong team.

'We just have to be ready, we must focus on ourselves and play our own game. We want to give them a good game.'

The Eagles trailed Liverpool 3-0 last season at Selhurst Park but fought back to earn a 3-3 draw.

'I watched that game again last week and it was amazing,' Warnock said. 'Liverpool could have been 7-0 ahead because Suarez missed so many chances, it was so exciting and a great game, it's why we love football.

'Our defence will have to put in another convincing display like it did at Manchester United, that is vital.

'We also need to create a bit more ourselves. It is all about finding that happy medium.'

Palace have scored just five goals in five home league games and Warnock wants his players to be more clinical in attack.

'We need to create a little bit more,' Warnock said. 'Teams perhaps have found us a little bit predictable so far.

'We've had easy opportunities in the past games and we haven't been able to put them away.

'But you cannot feel sorry for yourself. We have eight games until January and we must score more goals. We have a good group.

'We need to get back to basics, score more goals and earn our own luck.'
