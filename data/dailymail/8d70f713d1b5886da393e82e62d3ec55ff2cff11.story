Tragedy: Radwan Uddin was in a critical condition yesterday following the incident but has died from his injuries

A nine-year-old boy died yesterday after a gang of thugs mowed him down in a car and then beat up and mugged a passer-by who tried to stop them escaping the scene.

Radwan Uddin was in a critical condition in intensive care following the incident on Tuesday evening but police said he died from his injuries yesterday afternoon.

A silver Mazda 3 ploughed into him as he played on a bike with his older brother sending him flying 20 yards down a residential street in East Ham, east London.

Yesterday, a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of 
dangerous driving, failing to stop after an accident and grievous bodily
 harm after he walked into a nearby police station.

He has been bailed until August.

Police said a silver Mazda, registration LV58 SRX, was found dumped near the scene later on.

Radwan, who friends described as a 
‘really lovely boy,’ suffered a heart attack and head injuries and 
witnesses said he blood coming out of his ear and no pulse when the 
ambulance turned up.

The
 car, believed to have been driven by three Asian men, then smashed into
 another car shunting it down the street. The trio then got out and ran 
away from the scene leaving the boy fighting for his life.

Neighbours said locals tried to stop them but one man was beaten up and mugged when he got in their way.

The boy’s 12-year-old brother Mufhuj was also hit but escaped with minor injuries.

Sultan Ahmed, 59, said he heard a big bang at around 8pm and came running out his house.

He
 said yesterday: 'The boy and his brother were playing on a bike when the car came
 really fast and hit them. The younger boy went flying over the 
handlebars. After they hit him the car hit a parked car and shunted it down the road then they got out and ran off.

'We’ve
 had a few accidents round here but this is by far the worst one. I’ve 
got a nine-year-old son and I couldn’t sleep last night thinking it 
could have been him.'

Another
 local, who lives in Woodhouse Grove right near where it happened, said 
her sister-in-law, who is a paediatric nurse rushed out to try and help 
him.

The 22-year-old, who did not want to 
be named, said: 'All we heard was the car’s screeching engine. It was 
literally flying over the speed humps. It must have been going 40mph in a
 20mph zone. Then we heard a crash.

'My
 sister-in-law ran out. She was trying to give him first aid. His 
breathing was very shallow. At one point he stopped breathing.

'He was bleeding from the back of his head and there was blood coming from his ear.

'We
 called an ambulance. It took about 10 minutes to arrive but it felt 
like forever. When they did come they had to start CPR as they couldn’t 
feel a pulse.

The woman said as the drivers fled members of the public tried to stop them getting away. She added: 'One guy tried to stop them and he ended up being beaten up and mugged before they legged it.'
