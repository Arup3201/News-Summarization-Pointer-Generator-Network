Nigel Clough says Premier League teams have struggled to deal with Sheffield United’s quick wing-play and he has a point.

Since the start of last season they have beaten West Ham United and Southampton in the League Cup and Aston Villa, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup.

Tottenham Hotspur certainly need to be careful in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at White Hart Lane.

There is no doubt young Nigel will have grown up watching the great sides assembled by his father - with the likes of John Robertson bombing forward for Nottingham Forest.

The wingers for Brian’s sides were always the catalyst for success and it looks like Nigel is using a similar template.

United have a variety of players capable of playing on the wing, but they all have one thing in common - they are happy to sling in crosses from every angle.

Jamie Murphy likes to push upfield and cut inside to cross with his right foot and Ryan Flynn, who has played on the wing and at full back this season, is a bag of tricks down the right.

Louis Reed became the youngest player to play for United in the league last year and, at 17, is a talented youngster, while Jamal Campbell-Ryce is another rapid wide man.

Clough says top-flight teams struggle with United’s crosses but it’s more to do with the number of men who are prepared to fly forward and get on the end of them.

In the Premier League, defenders are used to playing against lone strikers with maybe another runner off the front into the area.

The reason the likes of Southampton and QPR have found it tough against United is because they pile people forward.

Against Southampton there were times when the score was 0-0 but they still had five men in the box to aim for.

They know they have midfielders who can play and Jose Baxter and Ben Davies in particular are excellent at joining the attack.

For Tottenham, the best way to combat this is to cut out the crosses at the source.

It will be up to Kyle Walker and Danny Rose to deal with the threat of these deliveries, but if United do get past the full backs Spurs have to be very well organised in the middle.

It’s just as important for midfielders to tuck back in and help as it is for the centre halves to defend well.

Southampton are a well-drilled side but even they couldn’t cope with United’s numbers in the area.

Tottenham will want the tie done and dusted.

If United get them back to Bramall Lane, it could get tasty. It is a fantastic old ground and if there is still a chance of a Wembley final the atmosphere will be absolutely red hot.
