Australian and UK health campaigners are being targeted with abusive, four letter emails and Twitter rants from a 'bizarre' online cult who oppose their stance on electronic smoking.

It has emerged an online group of e-cigarette smokers, known as 'vapers', have been attacking Perth professor and anti-smoking campaigner Mike Daube over his opposition to the battery-powered version which smokers use to help them kick their bad habits.

The Professor of Health Policy at Curtin University told MailOnline most e-cigarette dealers in Australia are 'dodgy' and are 'out to make a quick buck.'

And like other substitution cigarettes before them, he said there is little to no empirical evidence which suggest they work. His stance on the subject has received a severe lashing from their users who have sent a trail of nasty emails to him.

Attacked: an online e-smoking lobby known as 'vapours' have attacked health campaigners for their opposition e-cigarettes

'Four letter emails starting with C and F,' Dr Daube told MailOnline on Thursday.

'Really vile, vicious and nasty stuff. 'I couldn't tell you who they are, all I know is that there is this quite bizarre group called 'vapers' writing them.'

Dr Daube, who is also the president of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health, said he had never before experienced such vitriol in his 40 years of research in tobacco.

Those responsible for the emails stem from an online e-cigarette forums known as vaping chatrooms. Users post and comment on reviews of different e-smoking devices, share thoughts on their uses and discuss what products are on the market.

How e-cigarettes work and what they are made from vary, but most release a vapour that contains far less harmful carcinogens than a normal cigarette. Some do contain nicotine, while some do not - but a large percentage come in a range of flavours including mint, strawberry and chocolate.

The are not approved for use by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Association, and until they are, Dr Daube said, they will not have a place as a 'safe and healthy' alternative to smoking in Australia.

Professor Daube and another researcher from Sydney University, professor Simon Chapman, recently hosed down a study by London academics which concluded smokers were about 60 per cent more likely to succeed if they used e-cigarettes, than if they used willpower or over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies such as patches or gum.

They said such studies are often drawn from skewed sample groups, such as those who frequent online vaping chatrooms. Dr Chapman wrote in a peice for The Conversation: 'Data from such research tend to show sometimes stratospheric success levels,' going on to say the studies are 'almost worthless for smokers at large because they're drawn from non-representative populations, such as vaping chatrooms.'

Supporters say they are safe and are saving the lives of countless smokers who no longer inhale carcinogenic smoke. Their detractors say the health benefits and risks are still unclear.

In the UK,  Professor of Public Health Martin Mckee wrote a skeptical piece in the British Medical Journal on e-cigarette smoking, and straight after its publication received a trail of hate tweets from vapers.

'I have been overwhelmed by the response to my paper' he said. 'Within a few hours of it being posted on the BMJ website I was attracting hundreds of messages on twitter, almost all personally abusive ... 'vile cretin' was one of them.'

He said he 'had no idea that the e-cigarette lobby was so well organised.'

Dr Daube said if you can't quit smoking by going cold turkey, then there is a vast array of other tried and tested products that have been proven to help, like nicotine patches.

Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices which simulates smoking

The design was patented in 1963, and uses a heating element known as an atomiser that vaporises a liquid solution

Some e-cigarettes contain a mixture of nicotine and flavourings, while others release a flavoured nicotine-free vapour

They are sold in flavours like chocolate and strawberry that are banned in conventional cigarettes because of their appeal to young people

But their opponents claim they do little do little help people quit and actually encourage young people to smoke
