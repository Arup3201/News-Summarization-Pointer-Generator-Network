The first openly gay college basketball player Derrick Gordon has publicly debuted his relationship with an actor more than twice his age.

Gordon, 22, attended the GLAAD media awards on Saturday with 47-year-old Gerald McCullouch who is best known for his role on CSI.

The two men walked the red carpet together and posted multiple photos of their evening onto their widely-followed Twitter accounts.

'A night that I will never forget and a night that I didnt want to end.....@glaad  #betrue #loveislove,' Gordon wrote, tagging McCullouch's handle @ItsAHardG.

Gordon later called McCullouch 'handsome' in response to a different Tweet. 

'Unforgettable event last night....THANK YOU GLAAD...@ItsAHardG ..@glaad #Betrue #beyourself #loveislove,' he wrote in a later post.

Gordon also posted a photo from inside the event while posing with McCullouch and Wilson Cruz, the spokesman for GLAAD.

'22 years old now...4 years ago I wouldnt have never imagine my life changing so much and being at the GLAAD AWARDS...IM TRULY BLESSED!!!!' he wrote on Sunday.

Making the message clear: Gordon shared a number of pictures of the night with a few important hashtags

Big night: The awards capped off a big few weeks for Gordon as he came out in early April

'Living it up!' Gordon shared this picture of himself with McCullouch and Wilson Cruz, the GLAAD spokesman

Gordon, a sophomore guard on the UMass team, made the announcement about his sexuality via an interview with ESPN in early April and was met with resounding praise.

'It's a lot of weight lifted off my shoulders. I can finally breathe now and live life happily,' he said.

Their joint appearance was the first time that the two men have been spotted together since Gordon came out earlier this month.

During that interview, Gordon mentioned an earlier boyfriend but did not say his name and it was implied that they had broken up.

McCullouch has long been open about his sexuality and has starred in a number of gay-themed films and television shows.

Most recently, he has been promoting a web series that he is starring in called Husling, which follows the lives of a group of sex workers.

McCulloch was not the only one that Gordon was happy to see at the GLAAD event, however, as he posted about how Kylie Minogue danced on their table and they were seated alongside Naomi Watts, George Michael and George Takei.

The weekend of support didn't end when the GLAAD awards came to a close.

Two days later, Gordon posted that he had a good chat with Michael Sam, the first openly gay NFL player, and Jason Collins, the first openly gay NBA player, calling them his 'big brothers'. Neither were able to make it to the Saturday night ceremony.
