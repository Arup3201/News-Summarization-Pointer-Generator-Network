Bournemouth defender Adam Smith insists their promotion push will not distract them from their FA Cup fourth-round clash against Aston Villa on Sunday.

Eddie Howe's men are a point ahead of Middlesbrough at the top of the Championship table, despite losing 1-0 to Leeds on Tuesday.

The Cherries thrashed Rotherham 5-1 in the last round of the cup and have been prolific in front of goal all season, with 57 goals so far in the league.

Smith believes Bournemouth can 'beat anyone on their day' and vowed they would head into the match without fear of the opposition.

'Things are going well at the minute,' he told the Football Association website. 'The team spirit is very good and we're playing some good football.

'The lads won't be scared going into this game. We are just looking forward to testing ourselves against another top side.

'Hopefully we can beat Villa and then go on a bit of a run, like we did in the League Cup. We are looking to go on another good run and we'll see where that takes us.'

Bournemouth knocked out Premier League side West Brom during their impressive Capital One Cup run, which was eventually halted by Liverpool in the quarter-finals.

The experience of taking a major scalp is something which Smith believes can give them the extra self-confidence needed to progress this weekend.

'Villa probably aren't doing as well as they would like, but they have got plenty of quality and we know it will be tough,' he added.

'But if we can keep their big players quiet I'm sure we can get a good result and if we play our football I'm sure we'll have a good chance.'

Manager Howe could make a couple of changes for their second match this week.

No 1 goalkeeper Artur Boruc made his first start at Elland Road since recovering from a neck injury and will carry on between the sticks.

Midfielder Dan Gosling, who came on for the last half-an-hour in midweek, may come into contention if Howe decides to flood the midfield.

That means Brett Pittman could make way, with top scorer Callum Wilson set to lead the line.
