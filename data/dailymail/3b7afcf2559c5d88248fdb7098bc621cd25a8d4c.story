John Collins has insisted that Ronny Deila won’t crumble under the pressure of managing Celtic.

The Norwegian suffered a Champions League nightmare in his first major test as the Scottish champions crashed to a 4-1 first leg qualifying defeat to Legia Warsaw in Poland.

Facing the mountainous task of salvaging a £15million bounty in the second leg at Murrayfield, Deila will miss today’s friendly with Spurs in Helsinki to put in extra hours on the training field with key first-team players at Lennoxtown instead.

Joking around: Assistant John Collins will step up against Tottenham

Assistant manager Collins will take charge of a development squad including Craig Gordon, Efe Ambrose, local boy Teemu Pukki and Amido Balde against a star-studded Tottenham side.

Claiming Deila will prove his critics wrong after criticism of his team selection and tactics in midweek, Collins said: ‘Ronny is a strong character. He has been a manager for a number of years.

‘We have all been in situations where matches haven’t gone your way.

‘As a manager, as a player and a coach, you look forward to the next game and trying to put it right.

‘First and foremost we look forward to tomorrow’s game with the young boys.

‘Then on Wednesday we try to put in a good performance and try to get the result.’

Deila has come under fire for throwing new arrival Jo Inge Berget straight into the Warsaw clash just 48 hours after he signed a six-month loan deal.

Disappointing: There were no excuses for the Scottish champions' poor defeat in Poland

The Norwegian had played just 72 minutes of first-team football since signing for Cardiff City in January and his selection raised eyebrows, as did Deila’s decision to pick Adam Matthews ahead of Emilio Izaguirre at left back.

Insisting Celtic are still in the tie after surviving two missed Legia penalties, however, Collins shrugged: ‘If you are a manager you get these nights, disappointments and great results.

‘It’s all about trying to bounce back from the disappointments and go again.

‘You can’t feel sorry for yourself. You have to dust yourself down and get ready for Wednesday.

‘We know it’s a big task. But we’ll have a good support cheering us on – which we know will happen, they’ll get behind the team.

‘And we have to respond by coming out of the blocks with high tempo, putting them under pressure.’

Insisting Deila never planned to travel to Finland for today’s Spurs game irrespective of the Legia result, Collins declared: ‘That was always going to be the case no matter how the result went in midweek - but we just need to get ready and turn it around.

Tough test: Collins must try to lead a despondent team against Tottenham in Finland

‘Obviously it’s squeezed between the two big games so it wouldn’t have been wise to bring the first team out here – a three-hour flight, lots of travelling, so they’re at home resting, preparing for a big game on Wednesday.

‘They worked today, they’ll be working on Saturday, and then have Sunday off, ready to go again.

‘The game in midweek was a disappointment. The first half was going along fine but going down to 10 men makes it difficult. And to lose the two late goals makes it a tough task.

‘It’s only half time though - and we have goalscorers in the team.

‘I’m sure we’ll create plenty chances, we just have to take them and keep it tight at the back.

‘It’s a different ball game at home with the fans behind us. If we can get an early goal and light up the stadium, give the players energy, that’s the target.’

Collins was unable to cast any light on reports from Belgium that Lokeren want to sign Balde on a season-long loan deal.

‘I don’t anything about that. I haven’t heard but it could well be true,’ he said.

‘He’s not managed to break in and become a regular. But he has scored a few goals coming on as a substitute. But we’re strong in that department with (Anthony) Stokes and (Leigh) Griffiths and Pukki. So it’s been tough for him.’
