Russia has said it is outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine and blamed a far-right paramilitary movement for 'conniving' with the new government in Kiev.

In
 its latest salvo in a propaganda war over Ukraine, in which the U.S. 
has issued a list of what it calls 10 false claims by President Vladimir
 Putin, Russia accused the West of being silent over violence and 
detentions taking place there against Russian compatriots.

The foreign ministry said in a statement masked men from the Right Sector had opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the eastern city of Kharkiv on March 8, wounding some.

President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrive at the White House on Sunday following a trip to Florida. On Wednesday the President will hold discussions with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk about how to peacefully resolve Russia's military intervention in Crimea

It
 also said seven Russian journalists had been detained in the eastern 
city of Dnipropetrovsk, suggesting the new leaders and their Western 
allies were not committed to media freedoms.

'The
 shamefaced silence of our Western partners, human rights organisations 
and foreign media is surprising. It raises the question - where is the 
notorious objectivity and commitment to democracy?' it said.

 police are treating the Kharkiv incident as a minor one and say the 
only link to Right Sector came from an anonymous phone caller.

Ukraine's
 government and Western leaders have accused Russian officials and media
 of distorting the facts to portray the protesters who ended 
Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich's rule as violent extremists.

Witnesses
 in eastern Ukraine say tensions have been stoked by pro-Russian 
activists stirring violence to provide Putin with a justification for 
invading Ukraine to protect Russians there.

An
 official who monitors media freedom for The Organisation for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe said after visiting Crimea last week that her 
more pressing concern was about media freedoms in the southern Ukrainian
 region.

Obama held two lengthy phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past week. Putin told Obama that ethnic Russians in Crimea needed protection from attacks by Ukrainian nationalists. The government in Kiev, he said, was illegal, and Russia¿s actions to defend them were completely legitimate

Crimea's pro-Russian prime minister will give people living there the choice of taking Russian or Ukrainian passports if the Ukrainian territory becomes part of Russia in a March 16 referendum, it was reported today

Sergei Aksyonov, who declared himself provincial leader almost two weeks ago after Russians seized the parliament building, told the Russian news agency that Crimea would also encourage the use of two languages - Russian and Crimean Tatar.

Crimea's two million population, the focus of an increasingly bitter struggle for influence in Ukraine between East and West, has a narrow ethnic Russian majority but also includes more than 250,000 indigenous Tatars, who have returned since the 1980s after being deported by Stalin.

They oppose Russian annexation.

'We will not insist on the necessity of returning Ukrainian passports,' Aksyonov said. 'Everyone will have the opportunity to develop their own language. We do not want to limit the Crimean Tatars.'

She said 
pro-Russian authorities who have seized power in Crimea were clamping 
down on media that did not support them and were intimidating reporters.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama began a new week of diplomatic consultations on the Ukraine crisis with a phone call to Chinese President Xi Jinping that focused on a peaceful solution to Russia's military intervention.

Obama, who is to meet Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk at the White House on Wednesday, is seeking ways to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to loosen Russia's grip on the Crimea region of southern Ukraine.

Mr Yatseniuk will address the United Nations Security Council about the situation in Crimea on Thursday.

He was also quoted as saying he believed Russia, whose forces are in control of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, sought to 'undermine the foundations of global security and revise the outcome of World War Two.'

Obama spoke to Xi on Sunday night. China is a key ally of Russia and has heightened tensions with Japan by declaring an air defense zone over remote islands claimed by both countries in the East China Sea.

A White House statement released on Monday gave little detail as to what was discussed between Obama and Xi, saying the two leaders agreed on the 'importance of upholding principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, both in the context of Ukraine and also for the broader functioning of the international system.'

'The president noted his overriding objective of restoring Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensuring the Ukrainian people are able to determine their own future without foreign interference,' the White House said.

Obama engaged in various diplomatic conversations over the weekend in the search for a solution to the crisis. Last week Crimea's pro-Moscow parliament voted to stage a March 16 referendum to determine whether the region should be annexed by Russia.

The White House on Sunday said more international pressure on Russia would result if the Crimea vote proceeded.

'If there is an annexation of Crimea, a referendum that moves Crimea from Ukraine to Russia, we won't recognize it, nor will most of the world,' deputy White House national security adviser Tony Blinken told CNN.

Vice
 President Joe Biden cut short his trip to Latin America, nixing a 
planned stop in the Dominican Republic so he can attend Wednesday's 
meeting, an aide to Biden said.

Biden
 had been the White House's prime point of contact with Ukraine's 
president, Viktor Yanukovich, before he fled to Russia last month 
following violent clashes in Kiev.

Obama's
 White House meeting with Yatsenyuk will focus on options to peacefully 
resolve Russia's military intervention in the Ukrainian region of 
Crimea, the White House said, adding that the resolution must respect 
Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

By inviting Yatsenyuk, whose government 
Russian President Vladimir Putin alleged took power by way of an 
unconstitutional coup, the U.S. is also sending a clear signal to Moscow
 that the U.S. considers Yatsenyuk to be Ukraine's legitimate leader — 
at least for the time being.

'What
 we've seen is the president mobilizing the international community in 
support of Ukraine to isolate Russia for its actions in Ukraine, and to 
reassure our allies and partners,' said Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy 
national security adviser, as he announced the meeting Sunday on NBC's 
Meet the Press.

The 
announcement came as the Kremlin was beefing up its military presence in
 Crimea ahead of a planned March 16 referendum on whether Crimea should 
break way from Ukraine and join Russia.

Putin defended the separatist drive 
as in keeping with international law, but Yatsenyuk vowed not to 
relinquish 'a single centimeter' of his country's territory.

Obama has warned that the vote would violate international law.

Biden,
 who was traveling on Sunday to Chile to attend the swearing-in of the 
country's new president, had been expected to travel later in the week 
to the Dominican Republican to meet with President Danilo Medina.

But
 Biden has canceled that stop and will return to Washington on Tuesday, 
in time for Obama's meeting with Yatsenyuk on Wednesday, the vice 
president's office said.

The White House said Biden planned to reschedule his trip to the Dominican Republic.

Vacationing with his family over the weekend in Key Largo, Fla., Obama on Saturday spoke individually with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and French President Francois Hollande, and collectively with the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
