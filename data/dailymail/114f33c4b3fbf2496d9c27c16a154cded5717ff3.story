Crystal Palace have pulled the plug on the appointment of Malky Mackay as their new manager.

The former Cardiff boss was the favourite to take the vacant position at Selhurst Park following the shock departure of Tony Pulis two days before the start of the Premier League season.

Keith Millen will remain in charge for this weekend's game against West Ham.

Quick solution: Chairman Steve Parish wants a speedy appointment as the transfer window nears its end

Pulis left the club last week after disagreeing with club chairman Steve Parish over transfers. The 56-year-old helped the South London club to a stunning survival last year and wanted to progress this season.

But after being locked in talks with Parish at a crisis meeting Pulis decided enough was enough, though he officially left through mutual consent.

Mackay was the front runner for the job, especially after the chairman's comments at the weekend indicating he wanted experience and a swift appointment, but talks have now broken down.

One choice? Tim Sherwood may well be the bookies' favourite for the role now

Tim Sherwood was thought to be rivaling Mackay and could now be the bookies' favourite.

Mackay impressed in his first season in the top flight last year, though he was also involved in a controversial departure at Cardiff.

Despite helping the Welsh side to their first promotion to the Premier League and getting off to a solid start, the Scot fell out with owner Vincent Tan and was promptly replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
