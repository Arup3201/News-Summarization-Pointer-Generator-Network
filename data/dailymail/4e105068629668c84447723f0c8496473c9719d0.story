It seems increasingly likely that Frank Lampard will play a major and far-reaching part in Manchester City’s title campaign this season. 

The game against Crystal Palace looked won when he was introduced on Saturday, yet it was still Lampard’s interception that started the move for the third goal, putting the contest beyond reach.

As every positive contribution he makes must feel like a dagger at Stamford Bridge, Jose Mourinho has been driven to defend his sale.

Frank Lampard has already played a crucial role in Manchester City's best moments this season

Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer is happy to be part of a rotation system, and has proved a great signing

Jose Mourinho denies that Lampard could still function in his squad, but his defence is not convincing

‘We made the right decision,’ he insisted. ‘Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic are the next 10 years of the club. The project is to prepare for 10 years, not next year. 

'Didier Drogba is a striker, coming to help and support the strikers. John Terry is the best defender in England, so it doesn’t matter how old he is. A big player like Frank would stop the development of the other guys.’

Lampard has proved useful at City, both on the pitch and in helping young players develop

The former England midfielder was again involved in a City goal this weekend, once the game was won

This makes no sense. For a start, Matic is 26, while Fabregas will be 28 in May — they are not going to do 10 years in the first team at Chelsea. Equally, Lampard, used exactly as he is at Manchester City, as an impact substitute and occasional starter in a system of rotation, would not have harmed development in the least.

Indeed, as everybody at City cannot stop talking about his professionalism and worth as a role model to the youth and academy players, quite the opposite.
