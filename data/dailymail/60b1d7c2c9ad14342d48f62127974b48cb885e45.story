Devastating: Rik Mayall, pictured with his family, died of a heart attack after a morning run, his wife Barbara said today

Actor and comedian Rik Mayall had a heart attack after coming back from his usual morning run, his wife said today.

Barbara Mayall said the 56-year-old suffered an 'acute cardiac event' when he returned to his home in Barnes, south-west London, on Monday.

She said: 'We now know that our darling Rik suffered an 'acute cardiac event' at our home around midday on June 9th.

'He had just returned from his usual run and many people had seen him that morning.'

Mrs Mayall thanked the press 'for their discretion' and 'all the wonderful coverage', adding: 'It would have made him very happy.'

She added: 'I am sure that you all know Rik's response would be something along the lines of....."well thanks very much all of you.............now f*** off!!!"'

The announcement from his devastated wife came just hours after a post-mortem into his death proved inconclusive.

Earlier today, a spokesman for West London Coroners Court said today that more tests will have to be carried out to determine exactly how the 56-year-old died.

Yesterday fans began an online campaign to get his unreleased World Cup song to number one.

DJ Jon Morter, who calls himself the ‘charts hijacker’, has appealed to people on Facebook to get the 'lost' track, Noble England, to the top of the charts. 

Speaking yesterday he urged people to
 buy Mr Mayall's song which features him reciting the stirring speech 
from Shakespeare's Henry
 V over a football chant.

The track, which he recorded for the 2010 tournament, failed to chart initially, but it jumped 27 places overnight according to data from the Official Charts Company and is now just outside the top 10 at number 11.

Just a day before he was found dead at his home, Mr Mayall was photographed walking his dog.

Following the Blackadder star's death, his wife, said he had a 'strong heart' and added: 'I don't think it was a heart attack, but we just don't know until the coroner's report.

The mother of Mr Mayall's children, Rosie, 
28, Sidney, 26, and Bonnie, 18, said: ‘Maybe he had a fit, maybe it was 
his heart. We just don’t know.’

His devastated family used 
social media in the aftermath to pay tribute to the ‘wonderful, generous, 
foul-mouthed’ comedy star.

As
 friends revealed that Mayall appeared happy and healthy only half an 
hour before his death, his daughter Bonnie, 18, wrote: ‘My dad was loved
 not only by my family, but by many, many others.

‘We
 will never forget him and neither will the world. RIP to the man, the 
myth, the legend – my wonderful, generous, foul-mouthed and hysterical 
father. My idol now and forever. We love you daddy.’

Their
 tributes came after family friend and Comic Strip founder, Peter 
Richardson, 62, told how his son spoke to Mr Mayall just half an hour 
before he died, saying he 'chatted away happily' and 'seemed so happy 
and so healthy'.

Mr Richardson, 62,  spoke of his 'shock' at his friend's sudden death, and added: 'We still don't know quite what happened, but it was a seizure of some sort.  It was very quick.'

Referring to Mr Mayall's 1998 quad bike accident, which left him in a temporary coma, Mr Richardson said: 'Well, he had 16 years after the quad bike - at the time I don't think people thought he would survive that.

'But he lived for another 16 years, and it was just shocking that he went: he was so happy and seemed very healthy when he did go.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that
 police officers were called by the London Ambulance Service to a house 
in Barnes, south-west London, at around 1.20pm on Monday where a man in his 
fifties was pronounced dead at the scene.

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We sent two single responders by car, an advanced paramedic and an ambulance crew to the scene.

'Sadly, the patient died at the scene.'
