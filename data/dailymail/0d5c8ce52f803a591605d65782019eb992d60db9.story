A man stabbed his girlfriend to death before taking his own life in the home they shared, police believe.

Neighbours heard the couple arguing hours before officers found Gabrielle Stanley, 28, dying from her wounds and discovered the body of Simon Hall, 36.

Their long-term relationship is believed to have hit a rocky patch recently and Miss Stanley is said to have moved in with her mother.

Suspected murder-suicide: Gabrielle Stanley, 28, is believed to have been stabbed by her boyfriend Simon Hall, 36, after she said she was leaving him. He was also found dead at their home in Doncaster on Friday

Miss Stanley, who worked for a motor spares business, was described as a ‘beautiful, lovely girl’ who paid the ultimate price for leaving her bodybuilder boyfriend.

One local, who asked not to be named, said the mechanic had taken their separation badly.

She said: ‘He tried to kill himself last week when he split from his missus after she had moved out to her mum’s house. He couldn’t get his head around the fall-out and didn’t take the split very well at all.

'They were a lovely couple though and she came back earlier this week, maybe to patch things up or to talk through things, but it must have turned into an enormous argument.’

Death scene: Their house of two years in Doncaster where police found the two bodies on Friday night

Discovery: A forensic officer joins police outside. They were alerted to a 'furious row' by neighbours

Neighbours heard the couple rowing at their £120,000 home between around 7pm and 8pm on Friday.

Police were called to the address and found the shocking aftermath at 10.10pm. Miss Stanley was rushed to hospital but died from multiple stab wounds.

It has not been revealed how Mr Hall died, but his body was found elsewhere in the property. A neighbour, who was awoken by sirens and flashing lights, said: ‘I saw the front door open and they fetched someone out.

‘Two ambulance men came out and went in the ambulance – the person was on a stretcher or in a wheelchair.’

Moved out: Neighbours claim Ms Stanley, from Scawsby, Doncaster, had gone to live with her mother

Hurt: Reports claim Mr Hall was also hospitalised earlier this month after Ms Stanley ended their relationship

Just the previous week, Mr Hall had been in hospital after a suspected suicide bid.

‘Gabrielle had left him about a fortnight ago but she kept going backwards and forwards – I think he was trying to get her back,’ said the neighbour.

Both families of the couple said they were ‘devastated’ by the deaths of their loved ones.

Miss Stanley’s father also asked for anyone with information to contact police.

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘Detectives are currently not looking for anyone further in connection with these deaths.’

The couple had lived at the property for two years and it is believed Mr Hall had two daughters from a previous relationship.
