These are the first pictures inside Heathrow's new Â£2.5 billion Terminal Two, released as bosses at the UK's biggest airport announced it will open in exactly one year's time.

Replacing the old terminal demolished in 2009, the privately-funded terminal T2 will eventually serve 20million passengers a year.

The impressive pictures come as Heathrow bosses today promised to learn from the lessons of the Terminal 5 (T5) opening in 2008, which proved to be a disaster.

Everybody get to work! Workers gather together in the departures hall of Heathrow's Terminal 2 for a talk by Developing Director John Holland-Kaye during an event marking One Year to Go until it re-opens

Lots left to do: Replacing the old terminal demolished in 2009, the privately-funded terminal T2 will eventually serve 20million passengers a year, served by some 25,000 staff and 20 international airlines

An artist's impression shows how the finished terminal building will look from the outside: Check-in will be large enough to handle 3,000 passengers an hour, with more than 50 shops, as well as 17 bars and restaurants

In that fiasco, thousands of bags were sent astray while passengers faced long queues after problems delayed staff from getting to work.

Home to 25,000 staff, T2 is part of an overall project that includes not only the terminal building but also a 1,712ft satellite pier, a 1,340-space car park, an energy centre and a cooling station.

The first flight will land at 5.55am on the terminal's first day and this will be operated by American carrier United Airlines, one of more than 20 airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, that will be using T2.

Six years on from the T5 debacle, T2 will open in phases beginning from June 4, 2014, with airlines moving in over a period of six months.

Just 10 per cent of flights will operate for the first three weeks of June 2014 before gradually building up to full operations.

Also there will be six months of testing of T2, involving 14,000 people, before the opening. By the time of the first flight, the new terminal will have supported 35,000 jobs across the UK.

Check-in will be large enough to accommodate 3,000 passengers an hour and an average of 55,000 passengers will arrive and depart a day. There will be more than 50 shops, as well as 17 bars and restaurants.

'I would not underestimate the challenge we face': Heathrow Developing Director John Holland-Kaye, pictured on stage, said he couldn't promise that 'everything will be perfect on day one', but said many lessons had been learned from the fiasco at the opening of T5

Jobs: There will be six months of testing of T2, involving 14,000 people, before the opening. By the time of the first flight, the new terminal will have supported 35,000 jobs across the UK

Speech: Lord Deighton, Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, said T2 was an example of the kind of private sector investment in infrastructure that the Government believes will lift the country out of recession

Heathrow chiefs said they had worked hard to learn lessons from the T5 debacle but warned there would still be 'challenges' in getting T2 up and running.

Speaking before hundreds of hard-hatted builders at the T2 site today, Heathrow development director John Holland-Kaye, said: 'We cannot promise that everything will be perfect on day one but we have a lot more experience now having opened T5.

'But I would not underestimate the challenge we face.'

Chaos: People queue at check-in desks in the new Terminal 5 building in March 2008 after its new baggage handling system was suspended and dozens of flights were cancelled

Long delays: Thousands of bags were sent astray thanks to problems with the new terminal while passengers faced long queues after problems delayed staff from getting to work

Commercial Secretary to the Treasury Lord Deighton said today: 'Infrastructure is quite rightly at the heart of Government plans.

'We're investing more, cutting red tape and improving Government capability to deliver major infrastructure projects.

'But the vast majority of investment and delivery capacity lies in the private sector with projects such as T2, which forms part of the Government's Top 40 priority infrastructure investments.'

Under construction: Work underway on Terminal 2, which will open in phases from June 4, 2014

Outdated: The new T2 will replace the old Terminal 2 which was demolished in 2009

Mr Holland-Kaye added: 'The new T2 has been designed around the needs of our passengers, to allow them to get to and from their flights as quickly as possible.

'Like T5, it will promise world-class customer service and a warm welcome to Britain, which visitors expect from the UK's hub airport.

'This next step in Heathrow's transformation will deliver a better journey for passengers, a more efficient and reliable infrastructure for airlines and additional jobs, trade and economic growth for the UK.'
