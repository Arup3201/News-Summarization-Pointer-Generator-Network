Colombia striker Radamel Falcao is a world class player who will soon rediscover his best form for Manchester United and his country, according to his international coach Jose Pekerman.

Falcao, on loan from Monaco, has seen only limited action so far in England  under new manager Louis van Gaal, who has rebuilt the team with several new signings since taking over.

The 28-year-old is missing from Colombia's squad, who are in London to play a friendly against the United States at Craven Cottage on Friday, due to injury.

Falcao's permanent move to Manchester United is in doubt after fears over his on-going knee problem

When speaking on Thursday, Pekerman said the early season is often hard for players who may be adjusting to new a club, coming back from a long injury absence as in Falcao's case or having had a short pre-season due to playing at the World Cup finals.

Matches: 5

Starts: 3

Completed matches: 0 

Minutes played: 251 

Goals: 1 

'This is a new stage for him and for the (Manchester United) team, needing time to adapt to numerous signings, playing in a new competition (like the Premier League),' Pekerman told a news conference at the team's Heathrow hotel.

He added: 'Falcao is a top player, I'm optimistic he will overcome this stage and soon be at his level.'

Pekerman, preparing his team for the Copa America in Chile next year where Colombia will be looking to win the trophy for the second time, said such FIFA dates when national teams can come together for training and friendlies were essential.

'The high point of these meetings is the work on the field but there is also the chance for tactical talks, video analysis, going over objectives.

'We live these days intensely as part of our preparation searching for a better future.'

Pekerman, who steered Colombia to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil in July, praised the present generation of players for their commitment to their national team and their efforts to lift their standing on the international stage.

'Thanks to these players, people in Colombia can see their team at the big events, compete as equals with other teams, show off the genes and quality of the Colombian player.'

Colombia had missed the previous three World Cup tournaments after a former golden generation had reached three in succession in the 1990s.

Referring to Friday's opponents, Pekerman added: 'They had a very good World Cup. They are a team with an aggressive and intense game, this is a very good test for us... an experience for our new players.'
