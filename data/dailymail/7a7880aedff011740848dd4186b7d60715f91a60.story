James DeGale is ready to fulfil his destiny after learning he will box for the world title in Boston on May 23.

DeGale is bidding to become the first British Olympic champion to win top honours in the professional game, seven years after the Beijing Games.

The Londoner will face Andre Dirrell for the IBF super-middleweight belt vacated by Carl Froch.

'It feels so good,' DeGale told Sportsmail. 'We've been trying to sort out this date for a long time. We were working towards April 25 at the O2 Arena so I've been training for the last eight weeks non-stop, sparring 12 rounds and doing my two-hour runs.

'In that way it's been frustrating but I've got my date now and all my focus goes on that. I'm relieved that everything's set and I'll be ready.

'After this week I'm going to have a week off then I'll get back on it. I've done eight weeks of training, I've been watching my weight and living like a monk.'

DeGale's title challenge had originally been pencilled in for next month but promoter Eddie Hearn lost out when the fight went to purse bids. DeGale will, however, earn at least $1.5million (£1m).

'I would have liked to have boxed for a world title in my home city but it is what it is,' he admitted. 'Eddie lost the purse bid so I'm boxing in America. I'm getting paid very well for it and I've got the chance to make history; that's what dreams are made of.'

Dirrell has lost once in his 25-fight career - to Froch in 2009 by contentious split decision.

The 31-year-old has fought just six times since but recorded three routine victories last year.

'It's a difficult fight,' DeGale added. 'The guy is similar to me, he's very tricky and slick. He's a southpaw and it's an extremely hard fight but I think this is my time and I'm destined to be a world champion. I can't let this slip, I've got to win it.

'He's good with his feet and he punches in bunches but for all his attributes, I match him. It's going to be an intriguing fight to watch and very, very skilled. People are going to be in for a treat.' 

James DeGale has been using the world class sports science and training at Perform at St. George's Park ahead of his world title fight.
