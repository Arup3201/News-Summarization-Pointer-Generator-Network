You may be admiring your tan after a glorious weekend – but don’t get too attached to it.

For we have just a 25 per cent chance of enjoying a sizzling summer, the Met Office claimed last night.

Forecasters made a series of predictions based on weather models.

Don't get used to it: Londoners were enjoying the sun near to Tower Bridge on Monday, but the hot weather is not likely to last, says Met Office

They said there is just a one in four chance of temperatures being above average from this month to August.

Above average is defined as any temperature higher than 15C (59F).

And the odds of a particularly dry summer, with less than 175mm of rain, were just 15 per cent, making drizzly weather more likely.

The said average temperatures for the summer months were likely to range from lows of 10C / 50F to highs of 18C / 64F.

The average rainfall from June to August is set to be 241mm.Thankfully the odds of a particularly cold summer, below 13.75C / 55F, are low at 10 per cent.

But the chances of it being wetter than usual, with up to 450mm of rainfall, are higher at one in five.

The Met Office makes longer term forecasts to enable emergency services and other bodies to make contingency plans for extreme weather conditions. But these are harder to make with absolute accuracy.

The Met Office’s 30 day outlook last night stated: ‘The weather is expected to settle down with many areas having some warm sunshine, although showers are still likely in the northwest.

‘From mid-June to early July, the indications are that the weather will be close to what is climatologically normal for this time of year – giving us a tendency for occasional spells of unsettled weather interspersed with fine and warm spells, much as we have seen recently.’

In the shorter term warm, changeable conditions are expected today and tomorrow, but will give way to sunnier weather on Thursday.

Andy Ratcliffe, forecaster for Meteogroup, said: ‘These next few days will see showers with warm temperatures and breezy conditions. Later in the week will be dry and sunny as a high pressure system moves across England.

‘By the weekend the high pressure system will move south west leaving the north susceptible to more showers.’

The warmest place in the UK today is expected to be London where temperatures will reach 22C / 71F, and the coldest place will be the coast of Cumbria where temperatures will be around 15C / 59F.

The wettest area today will be Powys, where 15 mm of rainfall is expected.
