An 18-year-old learner driver led police on a 111mph chase through Birmingham that ended only when he crashed the car into a concrete post.

Adnan Pathan sped through the 100mph barrier as officers pursued him through residential streets in the Perry Barr area of the city shortly before 4am on May 4.

The chase came to a dramatic end when Pathan ploughed the high-powered £25,000 Volkswagen Scirocco into a pillar.

Adnan Pathan accelerated to 90mph - more than twice the speed limit - as officers pursued him on Walsall Road, pictured, a residential street in the Perry Barr area of the Birmingham shortly before 4am on May 4

He was jailed for six months and banned from driving for a year at Birmingham Crown Court after he previously admitted to aggravated vehicle taking.

The court previously heard how he drove through three major junctions, ignored a read light and caused another vehicle to brake while being pursued by police.

He also sped over speed bumps and undercut cars while driving at more than 111mph in a desperate attempt to evade the police.

Sentencing, Judge Patrick Thomas QC told him: 'It is pure good fortune you did not kill somebody else.

'You
 drove in the most dangerous way. You were trying to get away from the 
police at speeds in excess of 100mph and you were drawing away from 
them.

'A pedestrian walking out from behind a car on to the road would simply have had no chance at all.'

Earlier Madhu Rai, prosecuting, told the court the Scirocco had been hired by someone else, who hadn't given Pathan permission to drive it.

The court heard how Pathan, from Perry Barr, was driving on Birchfield Road when police first spotted him.

They followed him on to Walsall Road where he was driving at 80mph - twice the legal speed limit - before accelerating to 90mph.

The 18-year-old accelerated again, this time passing 100mph and 
undertaking cars in a desperate attempt to evade his potential captors.

Miss Rai said: '111mph is the maximum speed reached during the pursuit.

'Pathan went through three other major junctions, ignored a red light and caused another vehicle to brake.

'The defendant also went over speed bumps before the chase ended when he went down a dead end and crashed into a concrete fence post.'

Devon Small, defending, said Pathan had taken the Scirocco out for a drive and had intended to return it later that morning.

'It was while he was in Perry Barr that he realised he was being followed. He panicked. He did not have insurance for the vehicle.

'He did not think through the consequences of his actions. It was a high performance vehicle and he did not realise he was driving that fast.'
