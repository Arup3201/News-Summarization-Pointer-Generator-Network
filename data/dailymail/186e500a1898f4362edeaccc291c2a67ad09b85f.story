A 31-year-old man has been killed by an upper-cut from Batman - according to his family's obituary printed in their local newspaper.

Stephen Merrill 'found humor in just about everything' before his unexpected death last Monday, relatives in Winter Haven, Florida, said.

So as they sat down to write his obituary, still waiting for a post mortem to determine the cause of death, they decided to have some fun.

Despite speculation that his cancer may have returned, after receiving the all-clear in 2013, they decided comic-book-lover Merrill would want a more exciting send-off.

Superhero fight: Stephen Merrill, 31, was recovering from cancer but his death was unexpected. His family decided he would have wanted a playful obituary so wrote that he had been killed by Batman

The Ledger's editors initially refused to publish the piece, but after a meeting the family convinced them it was the perfect tribute to Merrill, a father-of-one.

'He would have been honored to have died by an uppercut from Batman,' his fiancée, Stephanie Vella, told ABC.

'It’s so great that they honored his family’s wishes. He wouldn’t have wanted you to come across his obit and be sad. He would have wanted you to come across the obit and laugh and have your spirits lifted.'

Merrill, who worked at Legoland, had surgery in Thanksgiving after tests suggested his cancer had returned.

Relatives felt he seemed healthy up until his death.

He had many of Captain America's qualities, Vella said, as he was considerate, helpful, and left an impression on people.

At his funeral, family members wore superhero t-shirts, and the program featured a quote from The Avengers.

The obituary read: 'Stephen Merrill, 31, passes away February 12, 2015, due to a uppercut from Batman.

'He was born January 28, 1984, the son of Larry Ronald Merrill and Bridgett I. Dotson Merrill. He was in retail sales at The Big Shop in Legoland, Florida.

'In addition to his parents, Stephen is survived by his fiancée, Stephanie Vella; son, Noah; and sister, Kimberly.

'Visitation is Tuesday, February 17, 2015, from 12-1PM with a celebration of life at 1PM, both at Ott-Laughlin Funeral Home, Winter Haven.'
