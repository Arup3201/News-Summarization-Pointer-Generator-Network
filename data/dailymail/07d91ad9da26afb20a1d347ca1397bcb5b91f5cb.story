Kell Brook has called Amir Khan's bluff regarding a potential grudge fight between the pair - telling his British rival: 'It's not about money for me.'

The calls for Khan to finally settle his long-running feud with Brook have grown stronger in the last few days, but the Bolton fighter insists he has more pressing issues.

While Khan is keen to meet the IBF welterweight champion 'one day', he added he would be keen on a winner-takes-all fight.

Kell Brook called out Amir Khan in an interview after beating Jo Jo Dan in Sheffield on Saturday night

Khan's last fight came against Devon Alexander in December, whom he beat to take his record to 30-3

Brook, though, is unfazed as he told Sky Sports News HQ: 'It's not about money for me. It's about everywhere I go, (people asking) "when are you going to fight him?".

'It's public demand now. I think that he's getting forced in to this fight if he gets in.'

Brook defended his world title with a four-round demolition job of mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan over the weekend and is supremely confident he could do a similar job on Khan, whose much-maligned chin is still considered to be a major weakness.

'He's been knocked down to the canvas by super-featherweights in his career,' said Brook.

'He's fighting a big, strong welterweight in myself who's a world champion, who's very confident, who's never lost, who's determined to flatten him.

'Don't get me wrong, Amir Khan is a very, very, very good fighter; very fast hands, most definitely the fastest hands I will have been in with. But the fact is when I connect on his chin, it's good night Vienna.

'I'm all wrong for him. I'll find a way to catch him, we've got 12 rounds. We'll have the perfect gameplan.'

Khan has previously refused a fight with Brook but now promises it will take place within 12 months

Khan, though, is chasing a showdown with the winner of the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao super-fight and told Brook earlier on Tuesday that he would have to wait his turn.

'I'd love to fight Kell Brook because it could be his last fight - I'd give him so much of a beating that it could end up being his last fight,' Khan told Sky Sports.

'Maybe he wants it because he knows that one fight against me will financially secure him for the rest of his life.

'But it's all about timing. If I've got a different route and I want to face the likes of Mayweather or Pacquiao out there; Kell Brook will have to wait.

'It'll happen one day and if Kell really wants to fight me, I'll fight him, but the winner takes all. I'll do a huge bonus because I know he's going to lose the fight.

'Give him a little guarantee, but the guy who wins the fight takes a big lump sum. That's how confident I am against Kell Brook.'

Promoter Eddie Hearn has responded to Khan by claiming the Olympic silver medallist has no interest in meeting his boxer.

'Amir seems to have this thing in his head about Kell not respecting him,' Hearn told Sky Sports News.

'Kell doesn't want to respect him - he wants to knock him out. Kell doesn't like him. It's quite simple.

'It's a tough fight. You can't take anything away from Amir Khan - he's a quality fighter.

'I just always felt that Kell Brook would win the fight. I don't think Khan would deal with Kell's power.

'Right now, Kell is golden and Amir is struggling to find an opponent. Whatever opponent he'll choose on May 30 isn't going to be Kell Brook and that's not what the public want. People will be disappointed with the opponent.

'Amir has put himself under pressure saying the fight will happen in the next 12 months and we hope so but unfortunately for him, Kell's stock continues to rise and the split is probably getting worse and worse as days go by.

'Winner takes all? I'll believe that when I see it because they have no desire to fight Kell Brook.'
