He's nearly 70 pounds overweight, suffering from high cholesterol and looks depressed.

But Bear, the obese doberman who was recently rescued in Texas, is on a path to recovery.

'He's slow but active,' the Lone Star Doberman Rescue group wrote on Facebook. 'He follows his foster mom around as much as possible. Just trimming his nails noticeably improved his mobility.'

Bear's caretakers say he's depressed and suffering from a slew of medical issues, including high cholesterol and joint problems

The organization rescued Bear in San Antonio last week, when the formerly stray pup was found weighing some 147 pounds.

He's on a new diet now and is receiving plenty of attention, but his condition comes with some heavy baggage.

'He’s pretty miserable,' Jennifer Rentfrow, who heads the organization behind Bear's rescue, told KSAT.

'He looks sad,' she added. 'He doesn’t feel good, maybe a little depressed.”

Bear's new fitness regime includes some short walks while he gets back into running shape

The huge doberman is being cared for by a foster family in Conroe, Texas, until he is ready to be adopted permanently

Due to his obesity, Bear 
is dealing with a slew of medical problems. His cholesterol is high and 
he's taking health supplements for his joints and thyroid medication.

'In the beginning, he'll have to go 
on some very short walks,' Rentfrow told KSAT. 'He's going to have to 
get conditioned somewhat to really have an exercise program.'

Bear is now staying with a foster family in Conroe, Texas.

'This evening, he proved that he can almost roll in the grass,' his caretakers wrote on Facebook on Thursday.

'He had a great time and although he couldn't quite get up on his back, he gave it a valiant effort.'

His goal is to get down to 80 pounds.
