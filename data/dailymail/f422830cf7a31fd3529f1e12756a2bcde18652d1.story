England are set for their lowest attendance yet at the new Wembley next week as ticket sales hover around the 37,000 mark ahead of the friendly against Norway.

So far around 20,000 tickets have been sold for the game, with 17,000 Club Wembley members in addition - who of course may or may not turn up.

Since the stadium opened in March 2007 the lowest recorded attendance for an England game came in October 2011 when 48,876 turned out to see the Three Lions face Sweden.

It what come as a blow to Roy Hodgson and the England squad, who will be hoping for as much support as possible as they look to move on swiftly from their shambolic World Cup campaign with a positive result against Norway.

An FA official confirmed the figure saying: 'So far the ticket sales are around the 37,000 mark, including Club Wembley members.

'It is hard to say whether we will surpass the total figure who were here at the Sweden game in 2011.

'However what we will do is to continue to push on with further marketing and media campaigns right up until the day promoting the game and hopefully we will beat this total.'
