A Texas mother of two and her boyfriend were gunned down on their front yard by her ex-husband hours after twice calling the police for help.

Grand Prairie officers confirmed that Jenea James, 37, had contacted them in distress on Saturday to complain that Dashun Atkins, 39, was making threatening phone calls and repeatedly driving past her home.

However, the only action police took was to provide her with information on how to obtain a restraining order and to contact Atkins personally to ask him to stop harassing his ex-wife because his two children with James, aged three and five, were at home.

But, at 2 a.m. on Sunday, three hours after James' last plea to police for help, neighbors phoned police to report gunshots and officers arrived to find her and boyfriend James Doyle, 41, dead while the two children were discovered unharmed inside their home.

Officers later found Atkins dead at his own home after apparently killing himself with a self-inflicted gun-shot wound.

It is unclear if the young children witnessed the murders and police officers are currently working to place them with relatives in the area.

'At no time leading up to the shooting did officers have legal authority to arrest Dashun Atkins,' police said in the statement provided to NBC DFW.

In addition to the pleading phone calls 
from James, police in Grand Prairie admitted to receiving a phone call 
shortly before midnight on Saturday from an individual who claimed to be
 a relative of Atkins.

That relative allegedly told police that Atkins 'indicated he got into an argument with his ex-wife and was saying goodbye.'

Police also admitted that they traveled to Atkins' apartment to personally speak to him, but he 'made no indication that he intended to harm himself, or anyone else.'

The neighbors at the Grand Prairie cul-de-sac heard the gun shots ring out around 2 a.m.

Timeline to Horror: Jenea James made her first phone call to police to complain about her ex-husband at 9 a.m. on Saturday - and the last at 11 p.m. - three hours before she was shot dead

'My daughter and I were up watching TV and all of a sudden I heard three shots,' said neighbor Karen Sims.

'There were six to eight cop cars shining through my bedroom window.

'We went outside and the whole entire cul-de-sac was roped off, we could see one body in the neighbors front yard.'

Other neighbors said that when Atkins left home they became aware that James was experiencing relationship problems.

Investigation: Neighbors expressed their shock that James had been gunned down on the front of her own yard

'She bought the house and lived there by herself and then had a boyfriend move in and he had been there several years and they had two kids and recently he had left,' said Beth Wells to NBC DFW.

Police spent hours yesterday gathering evidence at James' home and recovering bullet casings from the yard.

'It's really sad that she had two little children,' said Wells. 

'It's really sad that these kinds of things happen.  It doesn't matter where you live or what economic situation you're in, it can happen.'
