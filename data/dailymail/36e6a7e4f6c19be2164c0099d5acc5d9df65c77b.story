A mother's admission that she only bathes her three-month-old son once a week - if that - has sparked a fierce parenting debate.

Part-time blogger Claire Goss, 32, from Ashland, MA, made the candid statement on Babble in a post titled 'Do You Actually Need to Bathe Baby', prompting fellow users to brand her 'lazy' and 'gross'.

Today, the mother-of-three defended her parenting, telling ABC News: 'I aim for once a week. It might not happen. I will confess, it has gone longer than a week. . . It can be a good 10 days, but if you met my baby and held him, you'd probably think he smells as amazing as I do.'

Too busy: Mother-of-three Claire Goss has admitted that she only bathes her three-month-old son Charlie once a week - if that. Fellow parents are now divided on whether she is right or wrong

Mrs Goss says that a bath every evening was a routine with her first child, now five, but since then she finds she no longer has the time.

'My first baby got her daily baths, sometimes two bathes a day,' she said.

But when her pediatrician warned her that her second child's skin was getting dried out from too many baths, she eased up. Now baby Charlie's nighttime routine involves a diaper change, and washing his hands and face.

'In my gut I don't think he needs it,' she said. 'He is a happy baby, he is a healthy baby. . . What I realized now after five years of parenting children is, he's not a dirty kid, he's a baby.'

New routine: Mrs Goss says that her first child was bathed every night, but when her pediatrician warned her that her second child's skin was getting dried out from too many baths, she eased up

But while a nightly bath may not be essential for babies, it seems fellow parents are loathe to leave it as long as Mrs Goss.

Nina Postans, from Brooklyn, NY, says she bathes her three-month-old, Madeleine, every day as part of a bedtime ritual.

'In my gut I don't think he needs more frequent baths. He is a happy baby, he is a healthy baby'

'They are at a crucial age where they need to establish a sleep routine and having a nightly bath (water is fine - you don't need to use soap all the time!) is part of this,' she told MailOnline. 'Most babies actually enjoy being bathed plus it's ultra soothing for them.

'Babies also drool a lot at 3 months so if you're not washing their neck creases every day you're in for a delightful funky smell!' she added.

But fellow mother-of-one MaryBeth Long, from Westchester, NY, found that twice a week was best for her daughter, Kyra.

'Pre-crawling I probably bathed my 
daughter twice a week because greasy hair isn't cute on anyone,' she 
said. 'Now that she's a toddler I bathe her every other day since she's 
an avid fan of rolling in the dirt.'

Mother knows best: Mrs Goss says that every mom has the best gut instincts about their own baby, and that little Charlie smells 'amazing'

Psychologist and mother Stephanie Manes tells MailOnline that a potential risk in passing up bath time is that the infant may be losing out on a powerful moment of maternal connection.

'The
bathing ritual can play an important developmental role for a child in 
that it offers a powerful opportunity for mother infant bonding,' she 
says. 'Ideally, the bath is a time for physical closeness along with 
face to face contact when the mom can follow her baby's gaze - 
experiences that foster healthy attachment.'

The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to bathe babies at least three times a week, but acknowledges that 'too much bathing can decrease babies'
natural bacteria count and make them more susceptible to infections and
rash.'

'We've
learned now that baby skin is very different than adult skin,' Dr Alan
Greene, a California-based pediatrician, told ABC News. 'Really, you want to 
watch your baby more than watching the calendar when deciding to give a 
bath.'

And Mrs Goss echoes this: 'Mothers know their babies,' she said. 'They have gut feelings about their babies, and I would never presume to tell you how often to bathe your baby.'
