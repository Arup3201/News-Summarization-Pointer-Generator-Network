A major Sydney hospital is trying to contact women who had babies at the facility after discovering a fault in a refrigerator containing vaccines.

Royal Prince Alfred Hospital general manager Deborah Willcox said the vaccines may have been exposed to temperatures just outside acceptable or optimal levels.

'We cannot absolutely guarantee their effectiveness,' she said on Tuesday.

Ms Willcox stressed there was no risk associated with the slightly differing storage temperatures and said attempts to contact the 570 women admitted to one of the hospital's post-natal wards was precautionary.

These vaccines may not provide adequate protection against the illness.

The women would have had their babies at the hospital between August 2013 and January this year at a ward, 8 East, at RPA.

‘On the behalf of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital I would like to sincerely apologise for any concern this incident may have caused or may cause,’ said Ms Willcox.

‘We are taking a very precautionary approach and that is because mothers and babies are incredibly important to us.’

A free clinic has been set up to re-vaccinate affected persons.

Despite the critical error, the hospital assures the public that they can trust their facilities and staff.

'I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that they can continue have every confidence in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital,' said Ms Willcox.

'It is a proud hospital with an outstanding reputation. High quality patient care is our priority.'

The vaccine stored in the fridge was Boostrix, which is used to protect women from Dyptheria, Tetanus, Whopping Cough, Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps and Rubella.

The 570 women who will receive a phone call were identified through the use of log books, which recorded variations to the temperature of the vaccinations as far back as August 2013.

An investigation will take place to determine why the variances were not reported or flagged.

'There's no question that this is incredibly disappointing for us to understand that there have been variances over that period of time,' said Ms Willcox.

'We are undertaking an investigation so we can absolutely understand how this could have occurred.'

The problem was detected around ten days ago.

Anyone with concerns are encouraged to contact the clinical hotline on 1800 300 333.
