More than 50 deputies combed the Hollywood Hills Tuesday on horseback and foot, searching for a 54-year-old registered sex offender suspected of killing a 21-year-old man two weeks ago.

Oscar Bridges, who also goes by the names Peter and Rick, is a suspect in the stabbing death of Texas man Robert Brewer, who was found in dead in a South LA motel on January 23.

Police organized a search effort to scour the Hollywood Hills between the Greek Theatre and Runyon Canyon for the man considered to be armed and dangerous.

Search is on: 54-year-old Oscar Bridges (left) is suspected of stabbing 21-year-old Robert Brewer (right) to death in a motel on January 23. Police in Hollywood organized a massive manhunt Tuesday in the Hollywood Hills after receiving several tips that he was spotted in the area last week

Witnesses reported seeing the 6-foot-2 black man with dreadlocks in the area as early as last week.

'I've seen him up there walking around by himself without a backpack, without a shirt. So when I see it this morning on the news, it just kind of creeped me out,' Hollywood resident Oscar Murillo told ABC 7.

In addition to searching the Hollywood Hills, deputies also swept the Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Bowl.

During their search, they showed Bridges' picture to locals on the street, on the trails, in motels and homeless camps in hopes of getting a lead on his location.

In addition to being a registered sex offender, Bridges has an extensive criminal record including drug and assault charges.

According to police, Bridges likes to befriend young men between the ages of 16 and 25, and also has ties to Arizona.

Wanted: Bridges is described as a 6-foot-2 black man with dreadlocks, weighing approximately 180  pounds. He is a registered sex offender with an extensive criminal history including drug and assault charges

Friend of the law: Police say Bridges befriends young men between the ages of 16-25 and has ties to several attorneys in the area

They say he has worked with several attorneys in the area, and may have used his relationship to get around the law.

Police searched motels in the Hollywood and West Hollywood area because he is known to frequent such establishments.

The motel where Brewer was found dead is in the Westmont area, one of the most dangerous LA neighborhoods with 100 homicides in the last seven years.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at 323-890-5500 or Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477.
