The Muslim doctor who spoke out against Australian terrorists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar has this morning been the target of threatening tweets from a Twitter account believed associated with Elomar.

Twitter account 'Abu Hafs ozzie', which shares a similar username to ones previously used by the terrorist, this morning tweeted: 'Anyone in Sydney who can give me the details of Habashi dog Dr Jamal Rifi, anything, house details, wat (sic) area am willing to pay $1000'.

'Any details were he works or knows if his got kids which school they attend. Like I said I am willing to pay $1000 just for details'.

Pictured: Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar posed holding two decapitated heads in a disgusting display posted on social media in July.

But Dr Rifi told Daily Mail Australia this morning he would not be afraid.

'Their actions shouldn't instil fear among us to the point where that fear will paralyse us,' he said.

'And that's why I would refuse to be fearful of their threats'.

Dr Rifi made a number of public statements yesterday where he denounced the actions of the Australian terrorists.

His condemnation followed Khaled Sharrouf releasing an image of his seven-year-old son holding a decapitated head in the Syrian city of Raqqa at the weekend.

Another Twitter image posted by Khaled Sharrouf.

'What we saw to be honest, (is) very disturbing, especially when it's done in the name of Islam,' Dr Rifi said.

'And it can only be done by a very sick person'.

Sharrouf fled Australia on his brother's passport to Syria last year to fight for ISIS.

Dr Rifi, a prominent member of Sydney's Islamic community, was a finalist in the 2009 Australian Local Hero awards.

Dr Rifi said he was familiar with Khaled Sharrouf's father, but had never met the younger Sharrouf who has turned to terrorism.

He has played an instrumental part in forging positive relationships between the Muslim and wider Australian communities.Â 

He was a founding member of Muslim Doctors Against Violence and the Christian Muslim Friendship Society.

He helped recruit and train Muslim youth as surf lifesavers at Cronulla beach following riots in the Sydney Shire suburb in 2005.

Daily Mail Australia approached NSW Police for comment.
