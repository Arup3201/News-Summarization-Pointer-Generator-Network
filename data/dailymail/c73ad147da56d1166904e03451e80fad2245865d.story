Culture secretary Maria Miller has announced plans to give mobile phone users new protection against rip-off bills

Mobile phone users are to get new protection against rip-off bills.

Consumers will have the right to switch providers without charge if firms try to impose unexpected price increases, bills for lost or stolen phones will be capped and ministers want roaming charges scrapped by 2016.

The measures come as the political parties compete to help families with the cost of living.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who drew up the plans, said a new  ‘liability cap’ on mobiles that are lost or stolen will start next spring.

Though the level of the cap has yet to be agreed, it will work in a similar way to the £50 limit for debit and credit cards that are lost or stolen.

Customers hit with mid-contract price rises will be free either to accept them or to end their contract without penalty.

Mobile phone firms have angered customers by increasing monthly bills on 18 or 24-month agreements. 

This summer, for example, Virgin Mobile increased tariffs for consumers locked into its supposed ‘fixed price’ contracts by 2.9 per cent. 

Consumer group Which? has called for action, with 60,000 people signing its ‘Fixed Means Fixed’ petition.

Separately, the Government says it wants to end EU roaming charges, which add to the cost of using a mobile outside the UK. The action on these charges comes after the EU announced plans for a crackdown.

Four mobile companies – EE, Three, Virgin Media and Vodafone – have agreed to the measures, Mrs Miller said.

Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson said she welcomed agreement from the phone companies to help protect customers

She added: ‘We are ensuring hardworking families are not hit with shock bills through no fault of their own. Families can be left struggling  if carefully planned budgets are blown away by unexpected bills from a stolen mobile or a mid-contract price rise.’

Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson said: ‘The last thing you need after the hassle of a stolen mobile is to find that someone has used it and landed you with a sky-high bill too.

‘Phone companies have listened to government and to their customers and I welcome their agreement to protect them from unexpected costs and mid-contract price rises.’ 

Currently, consumers are usually unable to cancel a contract without paying a fee, unless the increase is above a fixed amount.

Under the new system, phone users are expected to get at least a month’s notice of bill increases and the right to switch providers without charge.

In 2007, the EU attempted to limit the roaming charges imposed on people using their phones outside the UK. But firms are still hitting customers with huge mark-ups on what they pay local phone companies for use of their networks.

Ministers say they want roaming charges abolished altogether within the EU and to bring them down dramatically for calls outside the EU.

‘We want to make it cost the same to ring Brighton from Barcelona as it does to ring Brighton from Birmingham,’ a Government source said.
