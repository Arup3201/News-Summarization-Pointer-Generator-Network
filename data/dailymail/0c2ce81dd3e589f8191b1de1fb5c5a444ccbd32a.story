The parents of missing mother Nicola Payne today said they were determined to find their daughter 23 years after she disappeared at the age of just 18.

Two men appeared in court charged with murdering the teenager today, but her mother Marilyn and father John said their 'ultimate aim' was to discover Nicola's whereabouts.

Nigel Barwell and Thomas O'Reilly, both 50, attended a brief hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.

After the hearing, Nicola's parents said they welcomed the fact that the men had been charged and vowed to find their daughter.

In a statement read by Nicola's aunt, Melanie Eales, they said: 'Although this is a significant step, our ultimate aim has always been to find Nicola in order to bring some peace to our family.

'The past 23 years have been extremely difficult and we would urge anybody with any info to contact police or Crimestoppers.'

They added: 'Police have kept us updated throughout this investigation and we would like to thank everyone for their support over the years.'

Barwell and O'Reilly, from Coventry, spoke only to confirm their names, ages and addresses during the brief hearing.

Family: Mr and Mrs Payne were joined by other relatives for the brief hearing today

The public gallery was packed for the hearing with Nicola's parents present, along with friends and relatives of both defendants.

The pair were remanded to appear via video link at Birmingham Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on Friday.

Afterwards, an emotional Mrs Payne, with tears in her eyes, led the family from court, supported by her relatives.

The two men are alleged to have killed Nicola between December 13 and 16, 1991. No trace of her body has ever been found.

They were first arrested in connection with Nicola's disappearance in late 2013, and had been on bail until they were formally charged by detectives from West Midlands Police this week.

Nicola has not been seen since she set off from her boyfriend's house in Coventry on her way to pick baby clothes and food from her parents' home in December 1991.

Her son Owen, who was just seven months old at the time, has been raised by his father Jason Cooke and is now 23.

Following today's court hearing, senior investigating officer Martin Slevin - who has guided the fresh inquiry into Nicola's disappearance - said his priority was finding the young mother.

He said: 'Yesterday's charges and today's court appearance mark a significant milestone in the search for what happened to Nicola Payne on December 14, 1991.

'West Midlands Police are committed to finding out exactly what happened on that day, and the thrust of the investigation now turns to finding Nicola's remains.'

He thanked those who had provided information, in particular since the inquiry was reopened in 2012.

Mr Slevin added: 'However, I am confident there are people still out there who hold the information that is key to this inquiry and I would urge them today, following these charges, to please contact the police or Crimestoppers, in confidence, and pass us that information so we can take it forward.'
