Lots of people say they're intolerant to it, but most of them don't even know what it is.

That's what talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel says is the case in Los Angeles, where he says eating gluten is considered worse than Satanism.

And, at least according to his research, it seems he is right.

On his late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live, the presenter said: 'I don't know if it's just here in L.A., but people are very anti-gluten. Which bothers me, because I'm very pro pizza.

'And you can't be pro-pizza and anti-gluten.'

Do you know what gluten is? This man didn't when asked by Jimmy Kimmel's researchers, despite saying he won't eat it

Neither did this man, who admitted he didn't have an answer. He did say he was another non-gluten-eating Los Angeles resident though

Kimmel said he suspected some people don't eat gluten because 'someone in their yoga class told them not to,' so he sent someone to interview people who avoid gluten just what it was they were steering clear of.

'This is pretty sad, 'cause I don't know,' the first man on the show replied.

The second man said: 'Gluten is in bread. It's a flour derivative, wheat, things like that …. It's like bread, pastries …. It's in those things. Gluten is like a grain, right?

'It's the wheat in products in like bread or pastas or rice,' a woman said. 'It makes you fat. I haven't researched it to the fullest. I have a girlfriend from Russia and she got me into it.'

Awkward: This woman said her friend is writing a book about gluten, and she didn't eat it. She didn't know what it was though

A bit embarrassing: This man in the "superjew" T-shirt said he didn't know either

The fourth man interviewed didn't have a better answer.

According to the Los Angeles Times only around one in 133 people in the U.S. are intolerant to gluten, the protein found in wheat, barley and rye.

Gluten refers to the proteins found in wheat endosperm (a type of tissue produced in seeds that's ground to make flour). Gluten both nourishes plant embryos during germination and later affects the elasticity of dough, which in turn affects the chewiness of baked wheat products.

Gluten is actually composed of two different proteins: gliadin (a prolamin protein) and glutenin (a glutelin protein).

Though 'true gluten' is sometimes defined as being specific to wheat, gluten is often said to be part of other cereal grains — including rye, barley and various crossbreeds — because these grains also contain protein composites made from prolamins and glutelins.

It isn't necessarily bad, but some people are gluten-intolerant, meaning their bodies produce an abnormal immune response when it breaks down gluten from wheat and related grains during digestion.

The most well-known form of gluten intolerance is celiac disease, which affects one in every 141 people in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. When someone with celiac disease consumes gluten, it triggers an immune response that damages their intestines, preventing them from absorbing vital nutrients.
