Just days after receiving a prosthetic eye, model and fashionista Lauren Scruggs is back in the blogging business.

Miss Scruggs returned to her BlogbyLolo.com site over the weekend with musings on summer attire, designer Prabal Gurung and New York City, where Fashion Week kicks off today.

The blog post, entitled 'inspired on sunday,' is Miss Scruggs' first entry since January 9, when she thanked her supporters for their love amid the ordeal.

She also took to Twitter on Sunday, bemoaning the loss of her preferred pair of jeans.

'My goal: to replace my first and favorite @truereligion jeans that were taken away in Dec! So hard to find the exact match!'

The denim brand quickly responded: 'What jeans?! We want to help reconnect you with your favorite pair!'

Miss Scruggs, 23, was nearly killed on December 3 when she accidentally walked into a plane propeller after taking a ride with a friend to see the Dallas Christmas lights from the sky.

Two weeks after the tragic accident, doctors decided that they had to remove Lauren's eye.

Though her parents have been actively updating her friends and family through their Caring Bridge website and television appearances, Lauren made her first public appearance on January 17.

She was seen walking out of Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas wearing a patch over her missing eye and a Cowboys football hat pulled low.

The prosthetic eye is a major step in her healing process, but she still has a long way to go.

Her mother Cheryl Scruggs said last week that while some of the physical pain that she used to feel while trying to sleep- which she described as 'ferocious' at the time- has begun to lessen, Lauren needs now to move on to her other forms of recovery.

'Lo’s physical pain has subsided a great deal. It is now the emotional pain that is the tough one,' Mrs Scruggs wrote.

The next hurdle for the burgeoning fashion blogger and model is the decision whether or not to be fitted with a prosthetic arm.

'We again met with the arm people this week. Again, another step,' Mrs Scruggs wrote Thursday.

More details continue to emerge about the December 3 accident as the emergency 911 call was released in late January.

'A girl walked into an airplane prop - I need an ambulance immediately,' the female caller tells the 911 operator in the seven-minute recording obtained by TMZ.com. 'I think it cut her hand off.'

In the call, placed at 8.48pm from the private airport near Dallas, the male caller described the model as conscious and breathing but bleeding badly with her face to the ground.

When asked exactly what part of her body she injured, the male caller says: 'We don’t know, we haven't turned her over.' Her cries and moans became louder throughout the call.

Witnesses thought that Lauren must have been crossing in front of the plane to go thank the pilot Curt Richmond, who was trying to warn her to avoid the propeller..

Mr Richmond put down his arm and turned away from her when he thought she had turned to walk away from the spinning propeller, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report.

But it's unclear whether she heard his warning over the roar of the engine.

Moments later, someone on the ground screamed 'Stop! Stop!' and Mr Richmond saw her lying on the tarmac and he immediately cut the engine.

Mr Richmond, believed to be a friend of Lauren's, had left the engine running while new passengers filed into the small plane as he prepared another trip to the skies.

The NTSB did not find fault with the pilot for the accident but air safety investigator Denny Kelly said Mr Richmond is ultimately responsible because he 'should have shut the engine down'.

'I don’t know how to thank each one of you, properly, for so much love during this difficult incident in my life,' Ms Scruggs wrote in January.

'My heart is so grateful beyond what I could ever imagine.

'Thank you dearly for the sweet encouragements, the precious words in letters and messages, the beautiful grace in pretty presents.

'But mostly I am so so thankful for you and your loving hearts and sweet spirits.'
