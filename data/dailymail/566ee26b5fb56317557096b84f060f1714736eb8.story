He is being called ‘The Third Winkelvoss’.

A man is suing the founders of photo sharing app Snapchat because he claims that they stole the idea from him.

Frank Reginald Brown says in his lawsuit that he came up with the concept whilst working on it with Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy when they were students at Stanford.

He alleges that things suddenly turned sour so they changed the passwords to the servers and shut him out.

Value: Analysts have valued the company that uses this ghost as its logo at $800 million

Brown was then horrified when he saw Snapchat become a huge hit with 60million pictures now being shared every day via the service.

Analysts have valued the company at between $60million and $70million.

Brown’s claims echo those of twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who say that Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them whilst they were all at Harvard.

They were given $65million in a settlement but spent four years trying in vain to get more, with their story being dramatised in the film The Social Network which was about the birth of Facebook.

Snapchat lets users send photos to each other which will then be deleted after a certain period of time, typically 10 seconds.

It lets people send embarrassing pictures without the worry they will be saved forever.

Brown, 23, alleges that he came up with the concept before going to Spiegel, who called it a ‘million-dollar idea’.

They supposedly agreed to work together and looked for somebody to write the code, so chose Murphy.

The trio moved into Spiegel’s father’s house in Los Angeles where they worked on the app in the summer of 2011, the lawsuit states.

Brown claims he came up with the ghost logo and the original name, Picaboo, which the trio used in the launch of July that year.

The following month however they had a falling out and the lawsuit states that Brown was locked out and the other two refused to talk to him.

The next month Snapchat was launched.

The twins: Twins Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, seen at a special screening of 'The Social Network' in New York, were given a $65million settlement after their claimed part in Facebook

As part of his claim Brown included a photo of all three men by a cake with the Snapchat logo on it, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Brown's lawyer Luan Tran told the paper: ‘He wants his share of what he is entitled to’.

The claims of start-up skulduggery will be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the ‘Wiklevii’ in The Social Network.

It was in 2003 that they claimed they asked Zuckerberg to write the code on their own social network, called Harvard Connection.

They alleged that he then started his own rival called thefacebook.com which went on to become the biggest website of its kind in the world with more than one billion users.

Whilst they were given their $65million settlement Zuckerberg has gone on to become one of the richest men in the world.

According to the latest Forbes rankings, he is the 35th richest man on Earth with a fortune of $17.5billion, although he was far wealthier before Facebook’s bungled stock market floatation.

A representative for Snapchat said: ‘We are aware of the allegations, believe them to be utterly devoid of merit, and will vigorously defend ourselves against this frivolous suit.

‘It would be inappropriate to comment further on this pending legal matter.’
