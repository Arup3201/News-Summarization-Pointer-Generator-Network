Video has emerged that reportedly shows the Puddle of Mudd frontman riding an airport luggage carousel prior to his arrest for the gag.

The surveillance footage from January shows what appears to be Wes Scantlin riding the conveyor for oversized luggage at the Denver airport, the Denver Channel reports.

Though the gag also allegedly saw Scantlin find his way into a high security area, the singer of 2001 hits 'Blurry' and 'She Hates Me' reportedly won't be facing federal charges.

Scantlin allegedly ended up in a high security area overseen by TSA, but won't face federal charges

'It's not a likely scenario in which someone would be able to get near an aircraft from this particular area,' explained Denver International Airport spokesman Heath Montgomery.

'We are nowhere near any aircraft and it would take a pretty big effort to get to an aircraft from here.'

According to KMGH, the areas in the main terminal and concourse are handled by local jurisdictions.

Scantlin was arrested after being spotted running behind the baggage carousel and 'out of the secured area through an alarmed door' at the Denver International Airport.

The band was in town for a show at a venue called Casselman's.

He was taken into custody shortly after.

Though bailed out and traveling straight from jail to the venue, Scantlin was still hours late to the stage.

'Those of you that stayed, I hope you love Puddle of Mudd [be]cause we will NEVER book them again,' wrote angry promoter Rock Panther on Facebook after the show.

Scantlin wrote a post of his own on the band's Facebook early Saturday morning seemingly in response to the incident.

'I'm here Denver! Thanks for your patience! – Wes xo' 

Though bailed out and traveling straight from jail to the venue, Scantlin was still hours late to the stage. This is not his first run in with authorities. In 2013, he was arrested for reportedly vandalizing a neighbor's patio with a chainsaw
