A
designer whose company decorated the nurseries of Prince William and 
Prince Harry has given a tantalising insight into what the latest Royal 
baby’s nursery could look like.

Lucinda
Croft, owner of luxury interiors company Dragons of Walton Street, has 
installed a selection of wildly expensive bespoke, hand-painted 
furniture into a room at the exclusive Grosvenor House hotel.

The
£26,000 suite, which can be booked by hotel guests, is littered with 
clues that suggest Kate, who is seven months pregnant, is one of her 
best customers.

Dream room: The cot is adorned with a stylised letter 'C' and a 'regal coronet', a crest made up of the hotel's initials

Crested heaven: The furniture has been hand painted specifically for the nursing suite. The duck egg and yellow colour scheme is gender-neutral

The cot is decorated with the letter
‘C’ inscribed above an illustration of a horse and carriage and a 
canopy fixed to a ‘regal coronet’ carrying an heraldic-style crest.

The
suite, which also has a doll’s hotel and a child’s table and chairs, is
described by  the company as having been ‘designed and tailored with  a
Royal baby in mind’.

Dragons
designed bedrooms for Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and helped 
Samantha Cameron decorate the No 10 nursery for daughter Florence in London.

William and Kate will live 
in a lavish four-storey, 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace that was
the home of Princess Margaret.

Their country residence will be a late 
Georgian ten-bedroom house at Sandringham, a present from the Queen.

Fit for a king or queen: Hand- painted furniture features characters from Beatrix Potter, including Peter Rabbit

Tiny throne: The toddler-sized chairs and table are just right for young visitors. Scenes of Buckingham Palace and the London Eye adorn the play table
