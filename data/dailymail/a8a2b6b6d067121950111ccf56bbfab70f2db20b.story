As the UK basks in a heatwave, a charity has found a way to put the sweat caused by the enjoyable results of the hot summer weather to good use - by turning it into clean, drinkable water.

UNICEF has created the Sweat Machine that squeezes the sweat from people's clothes and then purifies the liquid to create drinking water.

It was developed and built as part of UNICEF Sweden's campaign to raise awareness of the lack of clean water in many parts of the world.

Charity staff unveiled the machine during the opening of the the world’s biggest international youth football tournament, the Gothia Cup.

Players and visitors were encouraged to  hand over their sweat-drenched clothes, or to accept the challenge of drinking a glass of water from the Sweat Machine.

On average, one sweaty football shirt produced 10 millilitres of drinking water.

While many people might be squeamish about the idea of drinking water derived from human sweat, the machine proved surprisingly popular, with a number of celebrities having a tipple.

Swedish footballers Mohammed Ali Khan and Tobias Hysén were the first people to sample the refreshments on offer at the tournament.

The campaign was designed to raise awareness of 780 million people's lack of access to drinking water.

Around 125 million children currently do not have safe water to drink and thousands die each day as a result.

UNICEF works with governments and local organisations in more than 90 countries with the aim of giving every child access to clean water and toilets in schools and local communities around the world.

Per Westberg of UNICEF Sweden, said: 'We wanted to raise this subject in a new, playful and engaging way.

'Our Sweat Machine is a reminder that we 
all share the same water. We all drink and sweat in the same way, 
regardless of how we look or what language we speak.

'Water is everyone's
 responsibility and should be everyone’s concern.'

The concept was dreamed up by the 
charity, the Gothia Cup, creative agency Deportiv0 and celebrity 
engineer Andreas Hammar, but the machine has its limitations.

Mattias Ronge of Deportiv0, said: 'People haven't produced as much sweat as we hoped - right now the weather in Gothenburg is lousy.'

'We've installed exercise bikes alongside the machine and volunteers are cycling like crazy, but even so, the demand for sweat is greater than the supply.'

There are no plans for the machine to be mass produced as the charity uses better solutions such as water purifying pills in places where clean water is in short supply.

It costs £21 to buy 5,000 water purification tablets for people with no access to drinking water.
