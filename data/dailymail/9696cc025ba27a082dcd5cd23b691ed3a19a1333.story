A pupil at a top private boarding school appeared in court today accused of stabbing another sixth former.

The 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and wounding with intent after the incident on Sunday night at Langley School near Norwich.

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared before magistrates in Great Yarmouth today. He was remanded in custody.

Norfolk Police said the injured boy, who is also aged 17, had suffered serious stab wounds to his elbow and shoulder at the school which has been praised for its ‘caring ethos’.

He was today said to be in a stable condition in the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

Langley School, a co-educational day and boarding school, currently has boarding fees of £8,100 a term and day fees of £3,985.

It has 729 pupils - 429 boys and 300 girls - with 648 day pupils and 81 boarders.

Langley School headmaster Dominic Findlay said he could not comment on the incident due to the police investigation.

He said: 'Both boys involved are part of an investigation and at this stage I can’t comment.'

A parent of pupils at the school, who did not want to be named, claims that pupils had been told they would be expelled if they talked about the stabbing.

But Mr Findlay dismissed the suggestion that pupils would be expelled or excluded for talking about the incident as 'ridiculous' and 'complete rubbish'.

He added: 'All students have been informed of the incident by me in an assembly and all students have been spoken to. They’ve been offered support if required and that’s as much as what’s been said to the students.

'We’ve offered support to friends of the two students if they wanted to talk to staff about it and we’ve done that.'

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service Trust said paramedics were called to the school just before 10.30pm on Sunday and an ambulance was on scene at just after 10.45pm.

He confirmed two teenagers were taken to hospital, one with a serious injury to his back, the other less serious to his arm. Neither was thought to be in a life-threatening condition.

Langley School was founded in Norwich in 1910 and moved to a Grade One listed 18th century mansion in Loddon in 1946.

The headmaster states on the school website: “Langley is a warm and friendly school with clear values and high aspirations for all its students.

'The school provides a first class, all round education in a supportive community, in which our students learn to become independent, valued citizens and are able to develop their potential to the full.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
