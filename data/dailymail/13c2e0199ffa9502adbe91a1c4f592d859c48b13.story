Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson is not expecting any backlash from the Ghana Football Association despite claims of fury after Jeff Schlupp returned from injury at the weekend.

Schlupp did not team up with Ghana's African Nations Cup squad earlier this month due to a knee injury reported by the Foxes and confirmed following an independent assessment.

After being out for a fortnight, as predicted by Pearson, Schlupp was back in action in Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Stoke City, starting the match and playing for 70 minutes before being withdrawn.

A report this week suggested Ghana coach Avram Grant and officials were angry over the situation, adding there was a possibility they would even report the Foxes to FIFA.

Dismissing the story again, Pearson said: 'There isn't a situation with Ghana.

'I've not heard anything. If there is it's contrary to information I've heard officially.

'The rules are there, we've acted well within them, and there you have it. It's their choice.'

Asked whether he could understand the frustration of those within the Ghana camp, Pearson replied sternly: 'No!'

He added: 'I made it perfectly clear he would be out for 10 days to two weeks, which he was.

'He had an assessment and scan by us, and he then went to London for an independent one, which was arranged by them and concurred with our findings.

'The assessment by our people and theirs was the same - 'Don't fly!'. A decision was based on that because he had to the following day.

'I fail to see how anybody can have a problem with that.'

Andrej Kramaric could make his first start for Leicester against Tottenham Hotspur this weekend

Ahead of City's trip to White Hart Lane on Saturday for an FA Cup fourth-round tie with Tottenham Hotspur, Pearson has options.

Midfielders Esteban Cambiasso and Dean Hammond have trained this week and are in contention after being sidelined for three and two weeks respectively with calf and hip injuries.

Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and striker Andrej Kramaric appear poised to be handed their first starts after signing for City this month.

Defender Matt Upson, meanwhile, has returned to training following a long-standing foot injury sustained in pre-season and shortly after he signed for the club in the summer, although Saturday's game comes too soon for the veteran to make his debut.
