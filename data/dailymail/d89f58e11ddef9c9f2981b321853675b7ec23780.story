A woman was interrupted while trying to murder her disabled husband by the arrival of a shopping delivery, a court has heard.

Christine Houston was trying to strangle muscular dystrophy sufferer Stewart with a cravat when the Sainsbury's delivery van arrived at the family home on May 26 last year.

The door-knock brought an end to the attack, which left Mr Houston with blood spotting behind his eyes.

The killing bid has been linked to 'carer’s fatigue', where a person snaps through the pressures of looking after a loved one.

At Newcastle Crown Court this afternoon, the 66-year-old pleaded guilty to attempted murder of Mr Houston at their home in Waldridge, Chester-le-Street, on May 26 last year.

She appeared in court wearing a lilac fleece and was allowed to sit in the well of the court, rather than enter the dock.

Muscular dystrophy is an incurable illness that targets a patient's muscles causing them to waste away.

The disease is caused by a mutation in the person's genes, and can often be inherited.

More than 70,000 adults and children suffer from MD in the UK.

As the disease progresses, it can affect a patient's heart and breathing muscles.

In severe cases, this can be life-threatening.

There are several types of MD and not all of them cause serious disability.

It is understood Mr Houston did not support the prosecution of his wife, who he has been with for 29 years and has cared for him for many of those years.

She was granted bail to a secure unit, in Chester-le-Street, until sentence is passed next month.

At least one psychiatrist will give evidence at the hearing about her mental health problems.

Judge James Goss QC told her: 'You must understand, the fact that although you have now pleaded guilty to attempted murder and I am going to grant you bail for reports does not mean I am giving you any indication of what the sentence is going to be.'

Mr Houston was in court when his wife entered her guilty plea and the couple smiled at each other when the hearing ended.

He simply said “no comment” when approached by reporters after the hearing.

Mr Houston, who is in his 50s and is confined to a wheelchair, is severely effected by his condition and has extremely limited mobility.

His wife is allowed supervised contact with him in the weeks leading up to the sentencing hearing.
