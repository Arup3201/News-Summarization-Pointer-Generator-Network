Louis van Gaal has become the first manager of a major Premier League club to encourage his players to go to the European Under 21 Championships with England this summer.

The Manchester United boss wants Luke Shaw, Phil Jones and other United youngsters to be picked in Gareth Southgate's squad for the finals in the Czech Republic at the end of the season believing it will help further their careers.

'That tournament is a very good education and I said that as the coach of the Dutch national team as well,' said Van Gaal.

Gareth Southgate could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the Under 21 European Championships next year:

Raheem Sterling, Liverpool

Jack Wilshere, Arsenal

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal

Calum Chambers, Arsenal

Luke Shaw, Manchester United

Phil Jones, Manchester United 

John Stones, Everton

Ross Barkley, Everton 

'My defenders at the World Cup (who reached the semi-finals) Stefan de Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi, Daley Blind had all played in the European Under 21 championship. It's a good experience not many players have.'

Van Gaal's support is in direct contrast to the reservations of fellow Premier League bosses Roberto Martinez and Arsene Wenger and will be a huge boost to The Football Association who are trying to make international competitions taken more seriously within English football.

Following England's qualification last week for the finals, Martinez questioned why England should call up his young star at Everton Ross Barkley for the tournament while Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has regularly opposed full internationals like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere dropping back into the U21s.

Former U21 manager Stuart Pearce recently hit out at Roy Hodgson for picking Swansea City midfielder Jonjo Shelvey for the full England squad after he'd turned down the chance to be with the U21s.

Pearce is convinced England's weak performances in junior competitions has had an impact on recent World Cup showings. In contrast, the German side that triumphed in Brazil was packed with U21 champions such as Manuel Neuer, Sami Khedira, Mats Hummels and Mesut Ozil.

Van Gaal, who has worked with several top-class youngsters in his career including Patrick Kluivert, Andres Iniesta and Thomas Muller, has five United players in contention for the finals; £27million left-back Shaw who played in the play-off win against Croatia, Jones, brothers Michael and Will Keane, and Tyler Blackett.

And the Dutchman doesn't see any problem with young players extending their season.

'I don't think it is even a question or worth having a discussion. But that's my view because I think all the players want to play.

'For me as a trainer-coach of a club, I am very happy that Shaw is playing with the U21s. He played for the U21s while (Adnan) Januzaj was on the bench for the Belgium senior team. That is not a benefit for him, it was a two-week holiday.

'He would have been better at the U21s. I think youngsters have to play. When they are free, they need to play. Shaw was also happy to be with the U21s as he needs match rhythm.

'So it was good for everyone – the national U21 team, for me and for Luke.'

England went to the last U21s final under Pearce in Israel without 17 eligible players and failed to qualify from their group.

Southgate is anxious to avoid a similar drain on resources next year but will only include players who have won full caps if they are mentally ready to rejoin the Under 21s.

Shaw, 19, went to the last World Cup in Hodgson's squad but would happily play for the junior team to try and help England win their first U21 title since 1984.

Raheem Sterling, Wilshere, Jones, John Stones, Barkley and Oxlade-Chamberlain are also young enough to be eligible but Van Gaal accepts you shouldn't force individual players to go if they themselves think they are fatigued.

'Not every player is the same and I, as a manager, have to know that. Some players are too tired to play so the managers and the medical departments or the club and federation have to communicate better,' he said.
