It was just like any other summer's day for Sharon Camisa who enjoyed tending to her garden.

So when she became gravely ill, she never thought that potting mix would be the fatal catalyst.

Little did she know that the common backyard material contains bacteria which can potentially be deadly.

But by the time doctors found the cause Ms Camisa's condition was deteriorating to the point that she was on life support and in a coma, A Current Affair reports.

By the time doctors found the cause, it was too late for the mother-of-two who was already on life support and in a coma

In December - a few days after Ms Camisa repotted some plants - the mother-of-two had trouble breathing, suffered sore joints and couldn't sleep.

The 42-year-old, from Collie which is in the south west region of Western Australia, and her family didn't take it seriously, thinking it was just her arthritis.

However Ms Camisa progressively become sicker each day and to which doctors wrongly treated her for pneumonia.

Husband Mark, Ms Camisa's high school sweetheart, is still grieving the loss of his soul mate whom he'd been married to for 25 years.

'Sharon was my life ... I didn't need anybody else,' he told A Current Affair.

'Sharon was my soul mate, my best friend.'

When symptoms become worse, a blood test found that Ms Camisa had a lung infection caused by legionella bacteria - which can be found in potting mix.

She was diagnosed with legionnaires' disease but by that time it was too late.

Ms Camisa was in a coma and on life support.

She died just 34 days after she was diagnosed with the disease.

'It definitely makes it harder knowing that it could've been prevented earlier on in the stages if it got picked up by the doctors,' daughter Tiala said.

'It doesn't get any easier, you just get used to it,' son Michael said. 

Just nine months after Ms Camisa's death, her family is urging Australians to be cautious when handling potting mix.

Experts say it's important to always wear gloves and a face mask when gardening. 

'To lose a loved one over something so small as a 20 cent dust mask - it's heartbreaking,' husband Mark said.

'So I'm trying to get the awareness out there so people can understand that yes it can happen.'

He also wants bigger warning signs and is pushing for each bag of potting mix to be sold with a mask.
