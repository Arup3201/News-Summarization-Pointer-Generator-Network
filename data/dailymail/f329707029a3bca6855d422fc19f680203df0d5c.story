Sophie Anderson was a healthy 11-year-old primary school pupil who ‘loved her food’.

But then her family received a letter warning that she was ‘at risk of being overweight’ – helping to trigger a near deadly obsession with her body image.

The once fun-loving schoolgirl became anorexic, and increasingly withdrew from her family as her weight fell to less than four stone.

Sophie Anderson (with her mother, Mary) battled anorexia at the age of 11 and ended up weighing under 4st

With her major organs on the brink of shutting down, she was only saved after being force-fed through a tube in hospital.

Now aged 13 she is recovering and yesterday spoke out against the ‘ridiculous’ decision to weigh youngsters at school as part of the National Child Measurement Programme.

A week after she joined her fellow  Year 6 pupils in stepping on the scales, a letter was sent to her home with graphs attached which said she was at risk of being overweight.

Sophie said: ‘It’s ludicrous to weigh children at that age because before puberty you get a bit of puppy fat to prepare you for a growth spurt.

‘I think that’s very misleading and potentially very damaging for a child to be warned about their future weight at that time when they already becoming self-conscious about their appearance. I really believe it should be stopped.’

The Norfolk teenager, who appeared on ITV’s Daybreak programme yesterday, said all the children at her school compared the letters and talked about it in class which only made things worse.

She said: ‘I had been a completely happy child but from around this time I started becoming more self-conscious about my body. The letter was certainly part of it. I am also a perfectionist, which makes you more susceptible to anorexia.

‘I started off on a diet and it just progressed from there. I started losing weight rapidly.’ After being force fed to save her life she spent several months at an adolescent psychiatric unit before being discharged.

Her mother, Mary, described it as a ‘terrifying illness’ and called for more to be done to stop the obsession with diets and weight. She said: ‘The letter we got was typical of this problem.

‘At the time, Sophie loved her food, she was a healthy little girl going through natural bodily changes.

Speaking on ITV's Daybreak, she said: I think as you grow up there are so many pressures and expectations. From food, people can almost find a coping mechanism for the pressure'

Girl Guides will learn about beauty myths and the tricks of ‘airbrushing’ amid what has been described as a crisis of self-confidence in young girls.

Guides will spot which magazine pictures have been touched-up and discuss unattainable body traits to win a new ‘Free Being Me’ badge - as part of a programme to improve flailing self-esteem.  

The new badge will also be open to Brownies, aged seven to 10, who will explore how girls are portrayed as princesses.

Girlguiding has teamed up with the Dove Self Esteem project, a campaign to promote ‘real women’s bodies’, to try and boost body confidence in young girls who are feeling the pressure conform to unrealistic ideals.

A Girlguiding survey found 87 per cent of young girls think they are judged more on looks than ability and one in four girls aged between 11-to-21 would consider cosmetic surgery.

One in five girls of primary school age say they have been on a diet and more than a third of teenage girls have skipped meals to try and lose weight.

Chief Guide Gill Slocombe, said: ‘Along with Girlguiding’s 100,000 amazing volunteers, I am committed to helping girls develop into happy, self –confident young women – ready to take on the world.

‘But they hear all this stuff about  how “you are going to be obese” and it really doesn’t help.

‘It’s so important that we stress to teenage girls the simple fact that food is good for you and it keeps you alive.

‘One of the shocking things about anorexia is that it’s a mental illness, not just a physical thing. Sophie went from being a really happy girl to being a shell. There is a complete personality change. She got to the point where her organs were shutting down. She was at risk of dying.’

Sophie also called for more to be done to raise awareness of anorexia in children. She said: ‘I think it’s really important that schools talk about eating disorders. I’m back at school and I feel so much better about everything so there is hope you can recover.

‘My parents supported me but it took a massive toll on everyone and I just hope my story can help others to avoid going through what me and my family did.’

Hundreds of children have been sent letters informing them they are overweight or obese since the controversial child-measurement programme started in 2006.

Assessments are based on BMI – or body mass index – which compares weight and height.

Critics say BMI does not account for muscle –  so a rugby player could end up classed as obese – and does not account for height and body shape. This leads to taller people more often branded overweight as well as girls going through puberty who are developing breasts.

Eating disorder charities have described the letters issued by the National Child Measurement

Programme as a ‘scare tactic’ that could have damaging effects on vulnerable youngsters.

But health campaigners say it is vital to help warn parents about the dangers of obesity. NHS  figures show the number of children admitted to hospital with obesity-related conditions has risen four-fold in a decade.
