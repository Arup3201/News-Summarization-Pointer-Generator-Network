He’s a keen tennis player who is more than happy to show off his sporty side.

But sadly it seems David Cameron’s racquet skills don’t extend to badminton.

He joined Lord Coe and two top England juniors for a match in the rose garden at No. 10 yesterday, urging the public to get 'pumped up' about the Olympics.

Determination: He focuses grimly on a shot but rather spoiled the effect by asking: 'How does the scoring work?'

While Mr Cameron and Lord Coe 
exchanged some good shots as they played alongside Nicola Gresty and 
Jessica Pugh, both 15, the Prime Minister rather spoiled the effect by 
asking: ‘How does the scoring work?’

Nicola, 15, from Gloucester, who played alongside Mr Cameron, praised his performance.'You can tell he plays tennis,' she added. Lord Coe was joined by Jessica, also 15, from Telford, Shropshire.

The girls will be taking part in the Sainsbury’s School Games, which is part of the legacy project for the Olympics.

Addressing youngsters, IOC members and sporting stars such as heptathlete Denise Lewis in Number 10, Mr Cameron said: 'Let’s get the whole country absolutely pumped up for this games.'

Lord Coe said the contest, on a specially set-up badminton court behind Downing Street, had been 'fantastic fun'.

'I
 guess the more serious message is that in a space (measuring) 40-by-20,
 families could create that kind of theatre for themselves,' he added. 
'It is just about engaging people with sport.'

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted that inspiring young people was a key part of the long-term benefit from the Olympics.

'We want this to be the first real Legacy Olympics, which means that work is going to carry on after the Olympics is over,' he said.

After about ten minutes the match was declared an honourable draw.
