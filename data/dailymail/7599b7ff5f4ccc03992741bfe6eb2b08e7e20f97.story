NYPD Commissioner William Bratton has warned the city expects an ISIS-inspired lone wolf terror attack after a new video calling for strikes was released by the group.

The NYPD have been warned to look out for jihadi attacks after the terrorist group released a call to attack American police officers, soldiers, intelligence officers and civilians in a social media video on Saturday.

'As you may recall, there was a similar threat, a Twitter threat, back in September, and shortly thereafter there were a number of attacks in Canada, Australia, also an attack here -- an ax-wielding individual attacked four of our officers,' New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said Monday on 'CBS This Morning.'

Following this latest threat, an advisory was issued to NYPD officers urging caution and awareness.

'This one is also very specifically directed at law enforcement personnel, so we're encouraging officers that when they're on these fixed posts, that they be even more vigilant that they might ordinarily be,' Bratton said to CBS News.

 'They're there for a purpose, to protect that location, as well as to protect themselves and the public. So if both of them are sitting in the car and they're busy texting away or not paying attention of the surrounding area, they're much more vulnerable to attack.'

An internal memo released to officers in the NYPD says that the new threat should be taken more seriously 'in light of the terrorist attacks in France earlier this week' which resulted in the death of more than a dozen people - most of them staff members of the satirical newspaper.

Indeed, Bratton said that his biggest concern right now is the threat of lone wolf attacks in the city

'They're continually working to attract new recruits -- not to go fight in Syria as much as to attract new recruits from around the world,' Bratton said to CBS News.

'They're extraordinarily skilled with their public relations campaign, if you will - much more so than the traditional al Qaeda operatives.'

The specific warnings offer advice to officers how to conduct themselves in public.

'If you are assigned to a fixed post, do not sit together in the RMP [police car],' members of the Sergeants Benevolent Association union were told in an email obtain by both The New York Daily News and New York Post .

'At least one officer must stand outside the vehicle at all times. Pay attention to your surroundings. Officers must pay close attention to approaching vehicles . . . Pay close attention to people as they approach. Look for their hands.'

Call to action: Above, a screen grab from a recent ISIS propaganda video. The video released on Saturday called on supporters to murder police, soldiers, intelligence members and civilians in the U.S. 

The video released on Saturday by ISIS starts with President Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron speaking about the terrorist group.

Then spokesman Abu Mohamad Al-Adnani appears and says: 'Do not let the battle pass you by wherever you may be. Strike their police, security and intelligence members, as well as their treacherous agents.'
