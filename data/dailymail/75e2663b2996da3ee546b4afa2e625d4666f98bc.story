She spends her days sewing bat wings onto bearded dragons and transforming sheep into unicorns but taxidermist Jayne Brown, 45, from Southend-on-Sea says none of this is particularly unusual.

A self-described 'rogue taxidermist', Ms Brown describes her profession as a form of upcycling and says she insists on sourcing the animals used in an ethical way.

Now the glamorous forty-something is to appear on new Channel 4 documentary, All Creatures Great and Stuffed and says she hopes it will change peoples' preconceptions of the art.

'I hope it makes people see taxidermy in a different light, she explains, 'because most people think of Norman Bates [the taxidermy-obsessed serial killer in Psycho] or old men in a 
shed skinning squirrels. I'm hoping to dispel those preconceptions.'

Ms Brown, who also works as an interior designer, first became interested in taxidermy while redecorating her attic in colonial style and happened upon a stuffed lion while browsing for furniture on eBay.

'I stumbled across this full mount lion,' she explains. 'It was faded due to being left in someone's porch and I had to restore him.

'I had to re-dye him so I ended up going to Boots and buying up all the Nearly Blonde touch-up hair dye which, oddly enough, turned out to be the right colour.'

Curios: Jayne specialises in rogue taxidermy and creates lots of weird and wonderful creatures

Not that she uses it anymore. Now a fully fledged taxidermist, Ms Brown prefers using acid dyes designed for professionals and specialises in what she describes as 'rogue taxidermy'.

This, she explains, means creating weird and wonderful beast galore, including, most recently, a replica of the Vacanti Mouse - the so-called 'earmouse' created by scientist Charles Vacanti in 1997.

Although the human ear was crafted from latex, the mouse itself was real. Not that Ms Brown, a self-confessed animal lover, had one killed to order.

'I'm extremely concerned with being 
ethical,' she insists. 'The animals I use are natural deaths,Â  roadkill or mice and chicks that would otherwise be food for snakes. I certainly do not want anything 
killed for taxidermy.'

Her clients come from all over the world, with many declaring a passion for all things Gothic, while others want their dead pets preserved.

More still want fantastical creations such as mythical creatures created by cobbling together bits of different animals.

'I recently did a dragon,' she reveals. 'It was made from a bearded 
dragon [a large lizard] that had passed away and the wings came from a bat.'

Other specialities include pendants that include real rat or mouse tails, smaller mammals such as foxes and occasionally, a pet.

'The most odd thing I've been 
asked is when a man came to me with a living cat and asked me to turn it
 into a pair of gloves,' she chuckles.

'Obviously the cat was still alive, and he had a second - the plan was to have one for one glove and the other for the other.'

Gloves, however, are not where she sees the project going. 'I hope he 
changes his mind about it,' she adds.

'In the end, we came to the conclusion that a hat might be
 better because gloves get worn out.'

Laughing, she adds: 'People think I'm strange but there 
are people in the world who want their cats turned into gloves!'
