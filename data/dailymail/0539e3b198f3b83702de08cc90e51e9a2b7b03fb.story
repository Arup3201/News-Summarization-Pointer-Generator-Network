The Internet of Things (IoT) was a popular trend during CES, and was mentioned 3,816 times during the week-long show in Las Vegas.

In the battle of the car makers, Audi beat BMW with 3,966 mentions compared to 1,083 respectively. During the show, Audi announced that it had sent its self-driving A7, called Jack, on a 550-mile (885km) journey from San Francisco to Las Vegas

IOT is the idea of connecting everyday objects to the web, such as fridges, washing machines and coffee makers.

LG also made the top 10 list - in seventh place - after it announced a host of products including the dual-washing machine (pictured) 

For example, the Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by Smarter announced at the show can be triggered, via a smartphone, to not only make you a hot drink tailored to your individual taste, it can have it ready for you before you even wake up.

Once it has ground the beans and boiled the water to a precise temperature, it will send an alarm to the phone to rouse the user.

During the show, Samsung’s chief executive Boo-Keun Yoon said that in five years, every single one of Samsung’s products will be an IoT device.

Samsung then said the company’s new smart-home Hub will work even when it’s offline, and that it plans to invest $100 million in the development of IoT apps.

The AllSeen Alliance additionally announced it had developed a protocol that will make connecting devices together safer and more secure.

Chip maker Qualcomm has been working on a similar scheme, known as AllJoyn, that makes it easier to connect various web-enabled devices together on one network. 

Qualcomm and Microsoft are among the tech firms that are supporting the AllSeen Alliance.  

And following on from the Audi and BMW announcements, as well as demonstrations from Toyota, Renovo and Elio, the word ‘car’ was the fourth most talked-about trend of the show, with 2,552 tweets. 

Hotwire's Alex Maclaverty said: 'As brands, vendors, media and increasingly tech-savvy consumers head to Vegas for inspiration around the hottest gadgets for 2015, social media continues to be the best way to follow the event.

'We’re quite used to improvements in the television viewing experience, so, for me, the most exciting technologies are all about how the internet of things - particularly through wearables and the connected car - will revolutionise the way we run our lives.

'Perhaps 2015 will be the year we set ourselves to "automatic" mode.'
