Childcare centres around Australia are sending children home with poo-filled underwear in plastic bags to the shock of parents who have labelled the practice disgusting.

Nationwide guidelines prevent childcare centres from rinsing or washing clothing, so if a child has an accident, their pants the underwear must be bagged and labelled and left in a communal bucket for parents to take home at the end of the day.

Leah Spender, 34, said that she was presented with her son Ethan's underwear after being informed that the staff were not allowed to touch faecal matter.

'I had no idea that this was common practice. When your child is learning to "potty train" the Childcare providers ask that you bring in a spare pair of undies and shorts... but that was all I was told,' Ms Spender told Daily Mail Australia.

'The first time I was given my "goody bag" the day care mum said "Oh! Before I forget! Ethan has a present for you.." she walked to the toilet area and fished out a a grey plastic shopping bag, which was tied in a knot at the top and handed it to me. I could see the words "Ethan W" written on the bag and a date,' she said.

Ms Spender said that she was shocked that centres would send home a 'full piece of poo'.

'Dirty underwear is one thing, but wrapping the entire thing up, for you to then put in your handbag, walk down the street to your car.. and drive the whole way home with a full piece in the bag.. that's a bit far,' she said.

Cristal Jamieson, from Brisbane, took to Facebook to express her frustration over the practice, after she had repeatedly asked her daughter's childcare centre to throw out the soiled underwear rather than send it home. The final straw came when she opened a three-day old bag with her daughter's name on it.

Ms Jamieson posted on media personality Em Rusciano's official Facebook page, asking for advice on how to handle the situation. 

'Today, I got greeted with a plastic bag with an entire turd wrapped in princess pink undies with 'Ellie 16/03' written on,' she wrote.

'Yes my daughter is named Ellie but surely this isn't her complete turd packaged from 3 days prior after sitting in communal 'turd' bucket for 3 days!!! Surely...Can I please ask, what would have Em done? Please….'

Rusciano brought attention of her 100,000 followers to the issue, and said she 'would have lost my mind.'

'[I would have] taken the unfortunate doggy bag, found that person's car and placed the poo in a spot they would never find and just let the smell haunt them until they had to set their car on fire.'

Outraged parents were quick to comment, with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo.

'I have had such a turd greet me, but the day care centre in question were kind enough to distribute each individual turd in their little plastic bags into the respective child's backpack. Revolting, & thrown straight in the bin - because what else can you do with that kind of s**t?' posted one parent.

'This has happened to us!! But didn't know the s**t was in there until it fell on my laundry bench when I opened up the bag!' said another. 

While some on the post who claimed to be childcare workers expressed disgust at the practice, others pointed to national guidelines which enforced the activity.

Recommendations from the National Health and Medical Research Council’s 'Staying Healthy: Preventing infectious diseases in early childhood education and care services' guidelines released in 2012, childcare centres are advised to 'place any soiled clothes in a plastic bag or alternative, so parents can take their child’s clothes home'.

While the guidelines are not legislated, some childcare centres around Australia choose to accept the recommendations, and enforce the practice of sending home soiled underwear as part of the centre's blanket policy.

Ms Jamieson said that she has made a formal complaint with the Queensland Department of Child Services

A spokesperson from the Education and Care Services National Regulations said that education and care services are required to 'ensure adequate health and hygiene practices' and 'have laundry facilities or access to laundry facilities; or other arrangements for dealing with soiled clothing'.

'As the regulations do not prescribe what practices are considered adequate, service providers make their own decisions about what health and hygiene practices are used at the service, informed by relevant guidelines and best practice,' the spokesperson said.  

After communicating with her child care centre, Ms Jamieson said that she has made a formal complaint with the Queensland Department of Child Services, and said she is horrified that the practice is so widespread.

'This is political correctness gone mad, policies need to be changed,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

While the NHMRC's guidelines are not legislated, some childcare centres around Australia choose to accept the recommendations

'The centre said it was against their guidelines to do much more than package it up. I asked for them to throw the underwear out but staff changes mean that not everyone knows and that my daughter's poo keeps being sent home.'

Ms Jamieson said that she was worried that the hot bathroom where the soiled bags are kept would negatively impact on the toilet training of the children.

'This is a very critical time, developmentally, for young children, and the environment it meant to be pleasant. The room is disgusting, it smells, and this is not creating an efficient, rewarding experience.'

Ms Jamieson would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres cannot remove the poo, they throw out the underwear, and said that the practice is humiliating for children.

'It's like a child isn't deserving of the same respect that adults get. Imagine having to take your bag home with poo inside it, it's degrading,' she said.

'I can't believe this actually happens, this is not a Third World country.'
