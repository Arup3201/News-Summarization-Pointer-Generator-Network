Tebow time: Chuck Shriner, 17, dropped to one knee and Tebow-ed his principal at his high school graduation in Fort Myers, Florida

A high school student who 'Tebowed' on stage at his graduation ceremony was denied his diploma for the stunt.

Chuck Shriner, 17, dropped on one knee in front of his principal on Saturday during Bishop Verot's graduation ceremony.

Inspired by Tim Tebow, the New York Jets stand-in quarterback, the move mimics the football star's trademark pose of dropping to one knee and resting his hand on his forehead as he prays.

After his comedy moment, Shriner was told the school would withhold his diploma  - and later gave it to his mother instead.

The teenager told Naples News: 'They said what I did would give underclassmen inspiration to do something else, that it might lead to something else.'

Shriner, who plays football at the private Catholic school in Fort Myers, Florida, saw the audience erupt into laughter - but unfortunately his mother was not one of those who saw the funny side.

Along with being denied his diploma, Mr Shriner's mother, who is a math teacher, arranged for her son to clean the school gym as punishment.

The 17-year-old is due to start at the University of Central Florida studying mechanical engineering. He said that he was put up to the dare by his classmates - who rewarded him with five dollars for his trouble.

He cleaned the school gym yesterday but added: 'I think it was worth it.'

Tim Tebow's signature move has launched a thousand copycats around the world.

Tebowing has become a craze at weddings, on airplanes, in Grand Central Station and at the U.S. Capitol building to name but a few. One surgeon who had just performed life-saving surgery was even snapped striking the pose.

Celebrities were quick to jump on the Tebowing bandwagon with everyone from Alec Baldwin, Katy Perry, Maria Menounos and Robert Downey Jr adopting the move for the camera. 

Earlier this month, a dateless senior asked Tebow to her prom - and when she didn't hear back from him, decided to take a cardboard cut-out of the Jets player instead.

Sense of occasion: Bishop Verot High School did not see the funny side of the teenager's stunt on Saturday and threatened to withhold his diploma

Rachel Bird had her faux Tebow made at the local office supply store. Her date was a major hit with her classmates at Kingsley-Pierson High School in Des Moines, Iowa, who rushed the teen to have their pictures taken with her 'date.'

Miss Bird, a devout Lutheran, said that she was attracted to Tebow's Christian beliefs and football skills, not just the fact that 'he's not bad looking, either'.
