Clive Palmer has stormed out of an interview but it isn't the first time the Palmer United Party leader has yanked out his earpiece and refused to answer further questions from the ABC program.

Appearing on Lateline via videolink from the Gold Coast on Thursday night,  presenter Emma Alberici started off the interview about his public spat with Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie.

But when asked about an ongoing legal battle with the Chinese Government-owned investment company CITIC Pacific, he refused to continue the interview.

Ms Alberici said the civil trial brought against him, in which he is accused of dishonesty and fraud, soon turned into a heated discussion between the pair.

'Why did you tell your Chinese clients that you spent $12 million on the management of port facilities when in fact you spent that money on your other companies, yourself and the Palmer United Party?' Ms Alberici said.

But Mr Palmer said the allegations were 'not true' and 'it was just a lie'.

'Well that's just not right. How did you spend your salary at the ABC?' he said.

Before Ms Alberici said: 'Well did you want me to answer your question?'

Mr Palmer responded: 'Yeah, well how'd you spend it? Well let me - I'm giving you an example. That money was paid as port services. Once it's paid to our company, it's no longer their money, it's our money and how we spend it's our business.

Mr Palmer refused to be drawn on the legal battle, persisting the allegations were 'not true' and they have been 'made up'.

But the host continued to raise  issues  from court documents, while they both interrupt each other.

'Look, I'm not interested in that document,' Mr Palmer said.

But Ms Alberici said 'Well our viewers may well be interested because it - I wanted to ask you if - you're a public figure, Mr Palmer. The audience has right to know what's happening in legal cases against you.'

The party leader starts waving goodbye as he removes his ear piece, saying: 'Well, I'm sorry, goodnight. We'll see you. Goodbye. I don't want to talk to you anymore. See you later,' he said.

In July, Mr Palmer stood up and left mid-way through an interview with host Sarah Ferguson from ABC's 7.30 program.
