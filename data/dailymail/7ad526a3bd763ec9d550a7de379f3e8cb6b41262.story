It is widely used by patients to seek diagnoses, research drugs and find out details about doctors.

However, the notion of a medic using Google to research a patient is considered a breach of trust.

But now, the authors of a new medical paper have claimed that doctors should, in some cases, be able to use the popular Internet search engine to seek information on the people they are caring for.

The reason? Because sometimes it is necessary to protect patients - and others - from harm, say Maria Baker and Daniel George, co-authors of the paper in the Journal of General Internal Medicine

Although the American Medical Association's (AMA) guidelines provide doctors with general advice on the use of the Internet, they do not explicitly refer to the practice of 'Googling', the co-authors claim.

Despite this so-called 'Google blind spot', physicians' use of the search engine to find out patients' details is typically perceived (by both the public and doctors themselves) as an invasion of privacy.

But in their paper, Baker and George say that there are 10 situations in which it may be 'ethically valid and even warranted' for healthcare professionals to engage in 'patient-targeted Googling'.

These include when the doctor has a duty to 'warn of possible harm', if there is evidence of 'doctor shopping', if the patient gives 'evasive responses' or if they have made claims that 'seem improbable'.

They also include when the patient's story is discredited by other 'reliable healthcare professionals' the doctor suspects physical or substance abuse, or if the patient is believed to be potentially suicidal.

'Notably, all of these potential situations... are at their core concerned with patient safety,' Baker, a Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute genetics counselor, writes in the paper, available online.

Speaking to Reuters, George, an assistant professor in Medical Humanities at Penn State College of Medicine, adds: 'There is something worth protecting in the physician-patient relationship.'

Despite their list of 10 situations, the authors believe that, most of the time, 'patient-targeted Googling' is not acceptable. They hope their paper will spark conversation among medical experts about whether the AMA's guidelines should be updated in a digital age where search engines are ubiquitous.

In the document, the pair detail two real-life situations at Penn State when they felt the practice of 'Googling' was not only warranted, but necessary, to ensure patients' and others' safety.

Authors Maria Baker and Daniel George claim there are 10 situations in which it may be 'ethically valid and even warranted' for doctors to engage in 'patient-targeted Googling'.

Five of these are as follows:

1. The doctor has a duty to warn of 'possible harm' 

2. The patient has provided 'evasive responses to logical clinical questions'

3. The patient has made 'improable' claims about their personal or family history

4. The doctor has suspicions 'regarding physical and/or substance abuse'

5. The doctor has concerns over a suicide risk

In one of the cases,  a 27-year-old breast cancer sufferer underwent a series of cancer predisposition tests and was counseled about the results. But several years later, an amended report was released.

The new findings showed the woman had a rare bone marrow failure disorder that would affect all of her future children. The report also held 'clinically important information' for the patient's relatives.

However, despite repeated attempts to contact the woman, a clinician was unable to do so. Therefore, 'Googling' was 'viewed as a requirement to fulfill a professional obligation', Baker and George write. 

In the other case, a 26-year-old woman requested that both of her breasts be removed to prevent breast cancer, even though she had not been tested to see if she was at risk for the disease.

According to the co-authors, she reported an 'almost unbelievable' family history of breast, ovarian and esophageal cancer.

She had also sought the same surgery at other hospitals, they write in their paper.

When a medic 'Googled' the woman, she was found to be 'presenting her cancer story at lay conferences, giving newspaper interviews, and blogging about her experience as a cancer survivor.'

She was also determined to be 'raising funds, perhaps fraudulently, to attend a national cancer conference'. The surgeon subsequently refused to carry out the surgery without formal tests. 

Although Baker and George aim to highlight the ways in which 'Googling' patients can be warranted in 10 cases in their paper, they also acknowledge it can undermine trust among the public and medics.

'You have a patient wanting to adopt healthy lifestyles, and the doctor helps him on a course of exercise and non-smoking,' Baker explained. 'But the doctor 'Googles' him and sees pictures he posted on Facebook smoking a cigar.'

Mildred Solomon, president of the Garrison, New York-based bioethics institute The Hastings Center, congratulated the authors for raising questions surrounding the AMA's guidelines.

However, she said that their 'acceptable' reasons for searching for patients' details are too broad. Instead, she claims the doctor's intention is the key in determining whether 'Googling' is wrong.

'Why is the physician motivated to do this? Is it going to bring benefit to the patient, or is it something self-serving or out of personal curiosity?' Solomon asked.

A spokesman for the AMA declined to comment to Reuters Health, citing the issue as 'unresolved' by the organization.

However, a 2013 policy statement from The Federation of State Medical Boards notes that physician use of digital tools must evolve as do technology and societal trends. 

It acknowledges the use of 'patient-targeted Googling' in medical crises, such as attempts to identify unconscious patients in emergency departments.

But, according to the policy, 'it instead can be linked to curiosity, voyeurism and habit. 

Although anecdotal reports highlight some benefit (for example, intervening when a patient is blogging about suicide), real potential exists for blurring professional and personal boundaries.'

The paper's authors say they wish only for more dialogue about this digital practice.

'I think this is just a starting point,' George said. 'Every conversation has to start with something. This is the raw clay that we hope the field sculpts into set guidelines.'

Baker and George's paper, 'Navigating the Google Blind Spot: An Emerging Need for Professional Guidelines to Address Patient-Targeted Googling', appears in the journal's January print edition.
