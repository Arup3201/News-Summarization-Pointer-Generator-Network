Louis van Gaal has confirmed that Robin van Persie will be out for a number of weeks with an ankle ligament problem.

As revealed on Sportsmail on Thursday, the Manchester United striker faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines following his injury in the defeat at Swansea last week.

United manager Van Gaal said: 'Yes he's injured. He has an ankle injury and these can take a long time.

'It won't be one week or two weeks. We will just have to see.'

Van Persie is likely to be replaced in the United line up at home to Sunderland on Saturday by Radamel Falcao as young James Wilson has a dead leg.

Falcao, like Van Persie, has endured a difficult season at United, scoring just four league goals since his expensive loan move from Monaco.

'The possibility is higher of course because when a striker is away another has to play.

'I never give you any openings [in terms of who he will play] so we will have to wait and see.'

United need a win on Saturday to retain their slender hold on fourth place.

Asked how he would feel if United didn't qualify for the Champions League this season, Van Gaal, who won the Champions League with Ajax 20 years ago, said: '[It would be a] big disappointment [not to qualify].

'When you start the season with the objective of finishing in the first four of the league it is your objective and you are occupied with doing that.

'But we are still there, I don't know why are we talking about it when it is not like that, because we are still there. What is the problem?'

Van Gaal also addressed criticism of his players and defence, particularly after their 2-1 defeat at Swansea City last weekend.

The Dutch boss was quoted post-match saying that his team were unlucky at the Liberty Stadium.

'In spite of the criticism of our defence, we are there, we don't have many goals against us,' he added. 

'So, we are not unhappy, but we could have better results because we are not so much play it off the pitch. 

'When you see our matches we are mostly the better team, but the better team is not always winning.'
