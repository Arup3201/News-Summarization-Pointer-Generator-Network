Found dead: Sally Ann Vye was found dead after she absconded from hospital. She was not reported missing for almost eight hours after she was seen on CCTV leaving the hospital

A suicidal woman was found dead after walking out of a hospital while nurses ate birthday cake, an inquest heard.

The body of Sally Ann Vye, 39, was discovered at the foot of cliffs at Beachy Head, Sussex, on June 20 last year, the day after she went missing.

The inquest heard that Beaumont Ward, in the Bradgate Unit run by the Leicestershire
Partnership Trust in Leicestershire, was 'chaotic' while nurses celebrated a doctor's birthday.

She was not reported missing until almost eight hours after she was recorded on CCTV leaving the hospital.

Ms
Vye, from Leicestershire, had previously absconded and travelled to 
Beachy Head but had been saved by the intervention of a local chaplaincy
team. A healthcare assistant had also allowed her to abscond on June 19
despite needing the express permission of a registered nurse.

In
giving evidence on the third day of the hearing at Leicester Town Hall,
healthcare assistant Lisa Yeomans, said yesterday: ‘It was chaotic in 
the ward for the hour between 2pm and 3pm.

She said she had been left to deal with 'anxious' parents virtually by herself.

Ms Yeomans said: ‘Another female patient had absconded and her parents were very anxious.

‘I went looking for her with a student nurse. I reported her missing but senior nursing staff in the office were not interested.

‘They were quite jolly, eating chocolates and cake.’

She
told the hearing she had to go back three times before she got a 
response. The other missing patient was found elsewhere in the ward within a few minutes.

The healthcare assistant said she was also left to attend to an angry father whose son, returning to the ward after leave, did not have a bed.

Ms Yeomans admitted she filled in the head count sheet and incorrectly marked that Ms Vye was on the ward at 3pm and 4pm and admitted making those mistakes as she was recorded on CCTV leaving the ward at 2.25pm.

She said she correctly marked her absent each hour from 5pm until she finished duty at 9pm.

But Ms Yeomans admitted that she ignored procedure and did not report Ms Vye missing to registered staff at the first opportunity.

She said: ‘I had seen her dressed to go out earlier in the day and assumed she was going on accompanied leave.

Delayed information: DC Patrick Coyle told the inquest a police search was hindered because of faulty record-keeping and delays in raising the alarm after Ms Vye's body was found at Beachy Head, Sussex (pictured)

‘I kept presuming she was off the ward. I don't think I told anyone at the end of the shift.

‘I presumed a senior member of staff would have known.’

She said she did not know the woman was sectioned after a suicide attempt at Beachy Head just over a week earlier.

The
hearing was told the alarm was not raised until 10.20pm, when Ms Vye’s 
parents phoned the ward anxious about her safety and it was discovered 
she was not there.

DC Patrick Coyle told the inquest a police search was hindered because of faulty record-keeping and delays in raising the alarm.

He said: ‘Because of the wrong time on the log, officers scanned the CCTV to obtain a description of what she was wearing from 5pm onwards instead of from 2.25pm.’

He said the delay in raising the alarm had lost 'daylight searching' time as Sussex police were not alerted until after midnight, 14 hours after Ms Vye had absconded.

The hearing had previously heard a number of accepted practices and policies had not been transferred by the Bradgate Unit staff to the Beaumont Ward when it opened in December 2011.

Bradgate Unit senior manager Teresa Smith told the inquest she was satisfied that if all those practices and policies had been implemented, including staff abiding by their own professional standards, that Ms Vye would had been safe.

She said if monitoring procedure had been followed correctly, a search would have been started at 3pm that day.

Ms Smith agreed with Ms Vye's father, Ronald Vye, that, given the way the ward was being run at the time, his daughter could not have been protected.

The inquest continues.
