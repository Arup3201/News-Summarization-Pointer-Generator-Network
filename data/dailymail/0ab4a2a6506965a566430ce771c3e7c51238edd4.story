The breast implant health scandal spread to Holland yesterday, with 1,000 women there warned to see their doctors.

It was revealed that the French Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, implants at the centre of the scare, which has affected 40,000 British women and 300,000 worldwide, had been sold under a different name in Holland.

Dutch healthcare authority spokesman Diana Bouhys said:  ‘We estimate that some 1,000 women in the Netherlands have those implants.’

PIP – once the third-largest maker of breast implants in the world – stands accused of using industrial-grade silicone in some of its implants.

There are fears that the implants, which were sold around the world, could cause health problems if they burst or leak.

In Holland, the PIP implants were sold under the name M-implants, and the fact that they were rebranded has sparked fears that more women could be affected than originally thought.

M-implants and PIP-labelled implants were banned in Holland in March 2010.

While the French government has urged the 30,000 women in France with PIP implants to have them removed – and offered to pay for the surgery – other countries, including Britain, have only gone as far as saying that women should visit their surgeons for checks.

Israel's
Health Ministry have now opened a special hotline to provide medical 
advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company Poly Implant Prostheses could be linked to increased cancer risk.

It is estimated that 850 women in Israel have the PIP implants, some of the cheapest available, representing 5 per cent of the total number who
have undergone the cosmetic procedure.

Concerns about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago, when surgeons noticed 
they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands.

The French health watchdog ordered an inquiry, which subsequently reported ‘serious irregularities’ in the implants and they were pulled off the market.

Manufacturers were accused
of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years which believed to have been originally designed for mattresses.

They
have a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among 
French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from a
rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and 
implicated in at least seven other cancer cases.

It
has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating
designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked 
from spreading through the body.

It was feared that leaked gel could trigger cancer but to date tests have remained inconclusive.

The Israeli Health 
Ministry hotline has already dealt with around 1,000 concerned patients over the weekend.

The hotline information 
indicates that PIP implant procedures were not conducted in public 
hospitals but more common at private 
medical centers.

About 300,000 PIP implants, which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue, were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year.

PIP implant procedures have now been banned in Israel.

Up to now, there have 
been very few reported cases of the removal of ruptured implants in the Middle East, and no reports have circulated about new cases of leakage in 
recent weeks.

Sally Taber, director of the 
Independent Healthcare Advisory Services (IHAS) supported moves to reassure women.

She
said ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from the
Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Malta
and Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in 
incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence 
of any disproportionate rupture rates.

‘France are looking increasingly isolated in their stance and their pre-emptive statements have caused unnecessary alarm.

‘Our advice is that anyone concerned about their breast implants should contact their GP or implanting surgeon.'
