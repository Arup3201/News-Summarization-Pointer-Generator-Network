The black market is booming thanks to the 'invisibility' of online shopping as more and more criminals smuggle guns, drugs and counterfeit goods into Britain through the post.

More than a million parcels containing such items are sent to British homes each year, costing the taxman more than £3billion, a year-long study has revealed.

And efforts to crack down on the illicit trade are hampered by poor co-operation between agencies such as Revenue & Customs and the Border Force.

Some of the goods entering Britain by mail include tobacco from Malaysia and Singapore, counterfeit clothing from China, drugs from India and Hong Kong, and guns from the U.S., The Times reported.

The shocking figures were revealed following a year-long study by the Royal United Services Institute, which concluded online shopping was assisting organised crime groups in masking smaller but more frequent package deliveries.

It stated: 'The digital revolution now drives organised crime - with the click of a mouse, delivery by Parcelforce or private courier... it has morphed into an invisible trade, unseen by communities and out of the reach of law enforcement.'

One of the most commonly smuggled products is illegal tobacco, which is then sold under the counter in shops throughout Britain.

Last year it was reported that efforts to reduce smoking and improve health were being hampered by the black market trade of millions of illegal cigarettes filled with excrement, dead flies and asbestos.

The Local Government Association (LGA) said fake cigarettes also posed a fire risk, damaged honest businesses and cost the UK economy around £3billion a year in unpaid duty.

Recent council efforts to crack down on the illicit trade led to the seizure of hundreds of thousands of illegal cigarettes in Wolverhampton, Bristol and Nottingham.

One of the products most commonly smuggled into Britain is black market tobacco, which often comes from eastern Europe, India, Malaysia or Singapore

Southwark, Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich, Lambeth and Lewisham councils formed a partnership to tackle the black market trade of 114 million illicit cigarettes which are estimated to be sold in the area each year.

Trading standards officers found fake cigarettes hidden inside vacuum cleaners, under floorboards and in toilet cisterns.

Some contained asbestos, mould, dust, dead flies, rat droppings and human excrement.

Many featured much higher levels of toxic ingredients such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, lead, cadmium and arsenic than genuine cigarettes.

Fake cigarettes also pose an increased fire risk as they do not include designs that ensure that, once lit, a cigarette will self-extinguish if it is not actively smoked. This reduces the chances of them starting a fire if they are left burning in an ashtray, dropped or if the smoker falls asleep.
