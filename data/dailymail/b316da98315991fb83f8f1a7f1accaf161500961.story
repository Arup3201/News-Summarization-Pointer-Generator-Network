Dominique Ansel, the chef behind New York's indomitable pastry craze, Cronuts, is trying to crack down on scalpers and also warn customers about the dangers of accepting second hand food.

With only 200 cronuts made per day, and a line 40-people deep before the Manhattan bakery even opens its doors, the $5 croissant-donut hybrid has become a hot commodity for sweet-toothed New Yorkers.

And now a new delivery service, Premium Cronut Delivery, which has no affiliation with the bakery, is charging $100 for delivering just one Cronut, $200 for two, or $3,000 for ten.

Perfect pastry: The $5 Cronut was quietly unveiled by New York's Dominique Ansel bakery on May 10, and now a new delivery service which has no affiliation with the bakery, is charging $100 for delivering just one Cronut

Despite Mr Ansel enforcing a two-Cronut per customer limit in an effort to 
ward off scalping schemes, the delivery company continues to make five deliveries every weekday.

Although the chef has previously personally thrown scalpers out of the long morning lines, his major concern 
about third-party delivery is actually food safety.

'I don’t 
know much about the delivery service, but I do hope they give people 
some sort of guarantee for hygiene,' he told TODAY.com.

'Here at the bakery, we have to 
answer to the Department of Health, but once it’s out of our doors, I 
can’t guarantee it hasn’t been handled or (even worse), left out for 
days. Cronuts should only be eaten on the day of.'

To deter Cronut opportunists, bakery staff members actively police the queue for scalpers.

Recipe to success: The cronut is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian vanilla cream

Sweet and soft: Rose-flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer, which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake; finally, crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish

'I open the door 
for everyone every morning at 8am. And I say ‘hello’ to all my 
customers,' explained Mr Ansel.  'It’s only a matter a time before something seems kind of 
shady.'

He recalled the first time he was confronted with a scalper, who he said was 'was obviously 
drunk,' adding, 'it scared me to think someone bought second-hand food off of 
him.'

Last month, Cronuts were selling up to eight times their original 
retail price on Craigslist, available for delivery by scalpers in 
Manhattan ($20 each), Queens ($30 each), and Brooklyn $40 each).

After the Cronut was quietly unveiled on
 May 10, with a small batch of 50, by May 13, 200 had sold out by 
9.30am. One disappointed customer even 'flipped the finger' at staff on his way out of the pâtisserie.

In the making: It took around ten recipes, and multiple time and temperature adjustments before Mr Ansel found 'the trick' to sheeting and frying the dough in grape-seed oil at one specific, and secret, temperature

The bakery's owner and chef, Dominique Ansel, told MailOnline last month that while he's flattered, the re-selling is illegal.

'$20 for a Cronut. That's a 400% profit!' he exclaimed, adding, 'A lot of people ask me why we don't 
just do more?

'Well, I'm a big fan of quality over quantity. . . It takes a lot to ensure 
all our other pastries are up to par with standards as well.'

The Cronut, which is now trademarked to Dominique Ansel after interest from curious pastry chefs in Hong Kong, 
Melbourne, and Los Angeles, is made from thin layers of 
flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled
with light Tahitian vanilla cream.

'A cronut is not as simple as frying up 
some croissant dough,' said the chef. 'We actually make a special laminated dough that is
 sheeted and folded different than a croissant'.

The bakery, which opened in New York's Soho in 2011, makes the Cronut dough fresh daily in house, as well as the flavored sugars and vanilla ganache.

'The soft crunch was followed by an injection of cream and a whiff of a rose garden – thanks to the floral-infused icing. The perfect breakfast sandwich!' - Sadie Whitelocks, Femail reporter'There’s an element of the éclair about it, with the vanilla cream inside, which isn’t too sweet, allowing the rose icing to provide the sugar hit alone. They're insanely addictive – mine disappeared in microseconds. I could have devoured the box.' - Tamara Abraham, Femail editor

'That's why the batches are limited. Hopefully people will bear with us 
as we try to ramp up production,' the chef explained.

With such a swift reaction to the new pastry, Mr Ansel has filed a trademark for the cronut, 'just for our protection,' he said.

It took around ten recipes, 
and multiple time and temperature adjustments before Mr Ansel 
found 'the trick' to sheeting and frying the dough in grape-seed oil at one specific, and secret, temperature.

For
 the month of May, Dominique Ansel bakery is selling a Rose Tahitian 
Vanilla Cronut. In June, the store will launch a new flavor: Lemon 
Maple. And a new flavor every month after that.

A quick quote from the Chef: 'A few tips on how to eat the Cronut. Please cut (if you must) with a serrated knife to avoid crushing the layers.

'Do not eat the next day, eat immediately (they have a six hour shelf life) and will get stale in the fridge.

'Finally, try peeling off the layers one by one like a mille crepe cake.'
