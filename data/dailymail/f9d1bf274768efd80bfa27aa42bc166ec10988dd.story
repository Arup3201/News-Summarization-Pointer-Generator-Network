In days gone by this hardened bunch of war heroes may have taken a different approach.

But now, aged in their 90s, they decided to protest the only way they could when a TV crew filming  hit CBS show Hawaii Five-O nearby annoyed them.

The 24-strong group were taken to Hawaii by the Denver-based Greatest Generations Foundation for the Pearl Harbor attack's 70th anniversary.

But, as they tried to pay their respects at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, 50 yards away the Hawaii Five-O crew was being too noisy.

According to the veterans, the crew ignored their ceremony's more solemn moments and the national anthem and just continued to film.

Steffan Tubbs is a host on Denver radio station 850 KOA and a foundation board member and has led criticism of the CBS production team.

'The national anthem was played, colours were presented, and I noticed a couple of people didn't stop and show their respects,' he said.

At one point veterans were 
placing roses at anonymous graves when Mr Tubbs said a crew member 'shushed' the group and told them to move on.

'Here are these guys coming back for their final visit to Pearl Harbor and Hawaii. It was the ultimate disrespect'

'Here are these guys coming back for 
their final visit to Pearl Harbor and Hawaii,' Mr Tubbs said. 'It was the 
ultimate disrespect.'

'The whole time this production crew is on the graves. Cameras, lights, tracks for the cameras. You name it.'

So, at his suggestion, the veterans took action and issued a mass one-fingered salute, military-style.

The obscene gesture was delivered in unison from a bus as they were leaving, and left them all in stitches of laughter.

Mr Tubbs said: 'This was immature of me, but I said, "Gentlemen, if you so choose, how about we give them one big 
one-fingered military salute?'''

The last thing the production crew saw, he said, was a bunch of 90-year-old men flipping the bird at them.

'It was one of the priceless moments of my life.'

Apology: The show, which features Grace Park (left), who plays Kono 
KalaKaua, has issued an apology to the group. Former Lost star Terry 
O'Quinn was on the set when the angry exchange started

'Any rudeness by our staff can only be attributed to haste to finish our work. Not a lack of respect for men and women who have served and sacrificed for their country'

Peter Lenkov

The show's executive producer Peter Lenkov apologised to the group today, but disputed part of their account.

'Any rudeness by our staff can only be attributed to haste to finish 
our work,' he said.

'Not a lack of respect for men and women who have served and 
sacrificed for their country.

'And for that, too, we sincerely apologise to any that were offended.'

Mr Lenkov insisted the crew did indeed stop production for the playing of the national anthem and Taps.

'We recognise the privilege of 
filming in Hawaii and we are acutely aware of the deserved respect for 
its culture, history and the reverence that should be afforded to all of
our veterans, particularly those who served so nobly in Hawaii and at 
Pearl Harbor,' he said.

'It was one of the priceless moments of my life'

In a Facebook post, the Greatest Generations Foundation CEO Timothy Davis said Mr Lenkov's statement was 'not heartfelt'.

He called on CBS and Hawaii-Five-O to issue a formal written apology to each of the veterans in the group.

'Is this how during Pearl Harbor week the National Cemetery of the Pacific should be treated?' Mr Tubbs told Fox News.

'Walking on graves? The cameras, the booms, the mics. Personally as an American I took offence at it.'

'The damage has been done. The veterans have been upset. We left with a sour taste in our mouths'

Timothy Davis

'I don't think they had any jurisdiction to tell us to move,' Pearl Harbor veteran Walter Maciejowski told Hawaii News Now. 'You can't move buddies that are buried there.'

'The damage has been done. The veterans have been upset,' Mr Davis told Hawaii News Now. 'We left with a sour taste in our mouths.'

'If somebody was offended, that is a concern of ours,' cemetery director Gene Castagnetti told Hawaii News Now.
