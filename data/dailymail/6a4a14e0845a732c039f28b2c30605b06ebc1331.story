They've been branded 'high class prozzies', 'call girls' and 'pathetic sex workers’.

But what really makes an intelligent young woman, who has had every chance in life, use a sugar daddy dating service to meet an older man.

One who did sign up to a sugar daddy website is Emily, 22, from Hampshire, an advertising student studying at a university in the north of England.

The SeekingArrangement website where Emily met her sugar daddy

Far from being ashamed of her activities, Emily, who is using a false name but has provided real pictures, says people shouldn't be so quick to judge.

'A site like this just felt more honest,' she explains. 'It asks you about your desired arrangement and obviously you don’t get to ask things that you would on a regular site.

‘I get to say that that I want someone successful and powerful and who I find attractive and while that might sound arrogant on a normal site, in reality, it’s what most women want’.

 It took a few months of exchanging messages with different men online until Emily met someone that she wanted to meet up with in person.

The man she would eventually strike up a relationship with was a multi-millionaire but, at 44, he was also twice her age.

 Emily refers to her interactions with this man as ‘an arrangement,’ and she freely admits that despite dating him for six months, she was never in love with him.

During this time, her ‘sugar daddy’ gave her weekly cash payments and showered her with designer presents. 

'I got a weekly amount but mainly it was gifts and shopping and things that we would do and buy together,' she explains.

'He bought me Jimmy Choos, Dior shoes, dresses and jewellery - he kitted me out. He gave me everything down to workout clothes, an iPod, a new phone, speakers for my room, bed sheets, trainers and everything. It was nice. 

‘I have always been someone who likes going to nice places, wearing nice clothes and shoes and bags - having access to all of that is very much my cup of tea.’

Emily is reluctant to reveal how much the weekly cash amount was, but admits that it totalled roughly £5,000 over the six month period. 

On top of her clothes and weekly payments, he splashed out £1,500 on a fancy party for Emily’s 21st birthday.

'He paid for me to have a £1,500 birthday party with cocktail and cakes and champagne,' she explains.

‘I have never been treated like that before and I couldn’t get my head around the fact that he didn’t even want to be there. 

‘He didn’t ask for me to do something in return, he just cared for me and wanted for me to have a nice birthday party.’

Although the pros in Emily’s arrangement are clear, she admits that a lot is also required of her in order to be given these financial rewards.

‘Discretion is expected of me, because these guys do understand that there is a bit of a taboo around doing this.

‘I am also expected to look good, if I turned up in baggy jeans they’d ask what I was doing. Also, you should not infringe too much on their time, although often I feel like they are the more clingy ones. 

Seeking Arrangement is a dating site that links rich older men with young beautiful women. It was founded by US businessman Brandon Wade (pictured with his wife Tanya

‘I met a guy once and we were in his Porsche and he took a call from Lamborghini and I couldn’t really say to him, "Can you not do that?"

‘You are basically trying to be a bit more on your best behaviour.’

Emily claims that she didn’t sleep with her ‘sugar daddy’ during the six months that they were together, because she wasn’t ready.

But she does admit that they went further than any platonic friends ever would.

'He wanted more but I wasn’t ready,’ she explains.

When asked if they kissed and how ask far they did go, she replied: 'Yes, we kissed. It was like we were in the early stages of a relationship.’ 

Although Emily clearly enjoys the finer things in life, she says that the money is just one part of dating an older, rich man.

'I usually fancy men who are slightly older than me,' she explains.

‘With guys in my year, it’s a different kind of attraction - guys at university are hot, but if you try and have a conversation with them, it’s different. 

‘Men have a different offering - intellect, wisdom and awareness of themselves and of me.

‘Also, it has opened my eyes to what is happening in this country - I had no idea of all the things that were on offer. 

‘I guess it blurs the class lines - people think we’re worlds apart from millionaires but nothing could be further from the truth.’

Emily eventually broke up with her sugar daddy after the strain of being in a long distance relationship became too much and is now back on the site looking for another arrangement.

And while she freely admits that she is charging for her company, she is adamant that her behaviour is nothing like prostitution.

‘These are guys just looking for relationships, I have never referred to anyone as a sugar daddy and God forbid should I be called a sugar baby.

‘But you have to put a label on something - these men saying "I’ve got all of this money but I don’t know where to meet these girls". They don’t move in circles where they would fall into these situations, so it’s just a platform. 

'Anyway, some people would argue that a relationship and an arrangement are interchangeable. It is the link with prostitution that has been formed that is the problem. 

‘One has more beauty, one has more money and it’s just a platform for people with different offerings, whereas prostitution is a service or a product, something to be bought.

‘People are always going to make trade-offs in relationships and we’ve all got different things to offer. 

‘People are always going to be getting the most for what they can, that’s just society’.
