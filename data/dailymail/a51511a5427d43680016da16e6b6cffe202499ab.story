French actress Catherine Deneuve has defended film star Gerard Depardieu's decision to leave his home country to avoid a tax on the super rich.

Deneuve has written an open letter in response to actor Philippe Torreton, who criticised Depardieu for leaving France 'with a load of dosh'. She accused him of him of being resentful of the 'great actor'.

Depardieu, 63, put his £50m Paris mansion up for sale and moved to Belgium after France's socialist government set the top rate of income tax at 75 per cent on earnings above one million euros (£812,000).

Deneuve, who has starred in various films with Depardieu, including the 1981 classic The Last Metro and more recently Potiche in 2010, wrote: 'To take aim at his physique! His talent!

'This 'mess' you speak of - what right do you have, what democratic motive do you claim as grounds for your dirty condemnation?'

The actress was writing in left-wing newspaper, Liberation. The letter comes after another actress, Brigitte Bardot, sprang to the defence of Depardieu, who she said was a victim of 'unfair vilification'.

The Cyrano de Bergerac star, who has set up home just across the Belgium border in Nechin, has been condemned by French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault for being 'unpatriotic'.

Mr Ayrault said wealthy people are not 
leaving the country because they are afraid of becoming poor but because 
they 'want to become even richer'.

President Francois Hollande insists tax hikes are crucial to easing the country’s £24billion deficit.

Depardieu has threatened to give up his passport in response to the attacks and said he should be shown more respect. He has also accused the government of punishing success.

Critic: Philippe Torreton had spoken out against his fellow French actor

The newly-set tax rate makes France the highest taxing country in the EU. Belgium's highest tax rate is 50%.

France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, who runs luxury goods brand LVMH, applied for Belgian nationality in September and his decision  prompted Liberation to run a front page headline, ‘Get lost, rich b******!’

Russia president Vladimir Putin stepped into the row last week by telling a news conference Depardieu can 'consider it settled' if whats a Russian passport.
