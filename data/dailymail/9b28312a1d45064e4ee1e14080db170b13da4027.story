The brother of a model who died after she was stabbed in the chest has spoken of how it is a tragedy 'that good people die this young'.

Jack Hodari spoke of his grief after Linah Keza, 29, was found with stab wounds at her home in Leyton, east London at around 4.30am on Wednesday and was pronounced dead at the scene.

David Gikawa, 38, has been charged with murdering the mother-of-one and will appear at Thames Magistrates’ Court tomorrow.

Murder probe: Miss Africa model Linah Keza was found stabbed to death at an address in Leyton

Tributes have been paid to the young mother, who was born in Uganda before moving to Rwanda as a teenager.

She came to the UK more than 10 years ago and graduated from the University of Wolverhampton.

Mr Hodari told the Evening Standard: 
'It’s so tragic that good people die this young. I am not saying this 
because she was my sister, but the whole world can tell you this.'

Chairman of the Rwandan Community in 
London, Patrice Shema, said: 'We still can’t believe that Linah is gone.
You see these things on television but when it happens to you and it’s a
close friend, that’s when the reality hits home.

Model: It is understood Linah's daughter was at the address at the time of the attack, according to a family friend

'Linah has been a very active member of our community. She was such a wonderful girl, very happy, passionate about modelling.'

The community is now trying to raise money to have her body flown back to Rwanda when it is released by police.

Ms Keza, who was registered with the AMC Agency, was reportedly a contestant in Miss Africa 2010.

An AMC Agency spokesman said: 'She was very compassionate, amazing and a professional girl.

'May her soul rest in peace': Tributes to Linah from friends and relatives were left on a Facebook page set up soon after her death. Her three-year-old daughter is believed to have been found by her body

Scene: The block of flats in Leyton, London, where Linah was stabbed to death in one of the properties

'Everybody that met and worked with her via the agency will miss her greatly.'

Officers were called to her home at 
4.30am on Wednesday by neighbours where they discovered the pastor’s 
daughter had been viciously attacked.

Neighbours described Miss Keza as an ‘extremely loving mother’ and said she and her young daughter were ‘inseparable’.

More than a thousand people joined a Facebook page paying tribute.

It is understood that her daughter was at the address at the time of the attack, according to a family friend

Many posted photographs of Miss Keza, who worked as a model after studying social work at the University of Wolverhampton.

Make-up artist Bella Bordianu, who worked with Miss Keza, said: ‘She 
was very sweet and always smiling. She had a beautiful smile.

Photographer
Fabrice Rizzato said: ‘Linah was very kind, very professional, very 
beautiful and very calm – I am shocked at the news, she was a dignified 
and kind person.’

Investigation: Police outside the flats where Linah was allegedly murdered

Tragedy: Paramedics accompanied police to the address just before 4.30am, but Linah, a Rwandan national living in London, was pronounced dead at the scene
