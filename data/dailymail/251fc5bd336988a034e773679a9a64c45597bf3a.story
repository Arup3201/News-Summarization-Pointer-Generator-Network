AFL footballer Darren Jolly has undergone surgery to remove a lesion from his brain and is waiting to hear if the lump is cancerous.

The 33-year-old sought medical treatment at a Melbourne hospital last week after he had endured constant headaches when  doctors revealed the shocking discovery.

But The Block contestant and his 42-year-old wife Deanne remain hopeful after it was confirmed Jolly had a ventriculostomy - a procedure that drains out old fluid from inside the skull, which has helped eased his headaches.

A Channel 9 spokesman told the Herald Sun the former Sydney Swans and Collingwood star will find out more details about his condition over the next week.

'Until then there will be no further comment and he and his family respectfully request privacy while they navigate their way through this serious and sensitive issue,' a Channel 9 spokesman said.

Dr John Tickell, who is a former Hawthorn footballer and brain cancer survivor, told the Herald Sun that Jolly may have suffered a build-up of fluid inside his head from an old football injury. 

The Channel 9 spokesman said a  biopsy has been taken to determine what the lump is.

'His surgery went well and two incision points were created to drain the fluid, which has eased the pressure and headaches,' the spokesman confirmed.

The cancer scare follows as the couple, who have been married for more than 10 years, are expected to appear on TV reality show The Block: All Stars on Monday night.

The renovating pair triggered an outrage last year in the ninth season after their apartment was sold for only $10,000 over the set reserve price.

The couple, who have been married for more than 10 years, were only allowed to take home the five figure sum in prize money while the winners were awarded a total of $435,000.

The father of two ended his football career at the end of 2013 after playing nearly 250 matches across three clubs - Melbourne Football Club, Sydney Swans and Collingwood Football Club.
