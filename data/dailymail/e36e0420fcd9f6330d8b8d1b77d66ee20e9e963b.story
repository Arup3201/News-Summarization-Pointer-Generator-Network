Dashcam footage has been released of the car chase that ended with an Iowa teen shot dead by police after his father dialed 911 to report his truck stolen.

Tyler Comstock, 19, had taken the truck to buy cigarettes. His father reported the truck stolen in an attempt to teach his son a lesson, instead he was gunned down by Iowa State University police after ramming multiple squad cars.

Tyler Comstock's father will never know why his son fled and rammed into officers, but the dashcam footage shows his son's violent driving, and his horrifying death.

The footage starts with an officer pulling behind the white pickup with a black trailer at a traffic light.

The truck soon accelerates and leads the cop on a wild chase through residential neighborhoods and down one-way streets on the campus of Iowa State.

Tyler Comstock even brake-checks the cop at one point, causing the police cruiser to slam into the truck's trailer, but the chase went on.

The truck soon veered down a one-way street on the university campus before careening across a grass commons.

Though multiple squad cars rammed the truck, it kept going until it collided with a tree, then a few more squad cars before gun shots can be heard and an officer radios that the driver 'is not responsive.'

Ames police say the teenager, from Boone,
drove a stolen truck onto the Iowa State University campus on Monday, 
where student pedestrians dodged it to avoid being run over.

Patrol officer Adam McPherson fired six shots into the truck and the 19-year-old later died from two gunshot wounds.

Father James Comstock told The Des Moines Register on Tuesday: 'He took off with my truck. I call the police, and they kill him. It was over a damn pack of cigarettes. I wouldn’t buy him none.

'And I lose my son for that.'

Gary Shepley, Tyler's step-grandfather, questioned why police didn't back away from the truck, which belonged to a lawn care company, as suggested by an officer during the chase.

Mr Shepley said: 'So he didn’t shut the damn truck off, so let’s fire six rounds at him? We’re confused, and we don’t understand.'

The family says the teenager was not armed. They also say he was trying to get his life back on track.

Police reported that during the chase with the teenager, Comstock rammed Officer McPherson’s car.

Once the truck had stopped, the teenager refused to turn it off and revved the engine.

Six shots were fired into the truck by the officer with two shots killing the 19-year-old, according to the medical examiner.

The Comstock family said that the 19-year-old had recently split up with his girlfriend and was trying to get his life together after spending a few days in jail for disorderly conduct.

James Comstock said that his son had been attending community college and always showed aptitude for IT.

An investigation into the incident has been launched.

The boy's anguish family are searching for answers after he was killed by police following a car chase on Monday
