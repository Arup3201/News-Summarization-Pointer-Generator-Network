This is the historic speech the free world did not want to hear - and, thankfully, didn't.

Hastily scribbled on piece of paper, Allied supremo General Dwight D. Eisenhower jotted down what he planned to say had D-Day, which was 70 years ago tomorrow, been a disaster.

The little-known document, known as 'In Case of Failure', was quickly drafted by the commander of Operation Overlord in the event of the landings ending in bloody failure.

The 66-word script reveals the U.S. general and Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill would have withdrawn the thousands of troops from the Normandy beaches rather than let them fight to the death.

This is the chilling speech Allied supremo General Dwight Eisenhower planned to make had D-Day turned into Doomsday, scribbled down on a note

It also shows Eisenhower, who went on to become president in 1953, would have accepted the full blame for the unimaginable defeat at the hands of the Nazis.

In the event, the Normandy landings were a success and ultimately led to the beginning of the end of the Second World War.

Eisenhower
 gave the note to his adjutant officer five weeks after D-Day and it is 
has been held by the Eisenhower Presidential Library for the last 30 
years.

A copy of it has now 
been published by the British military online archive Forces War Records
 to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day.

Tom
 Bennington, of Forces War Records, said: 'It is a 
very simple document but one that is very chilling given what was at 
stake.

'While Operation 
Overlord went down in history as a success and gave the Allies a 
foothold in Europe, this piece of paper almost shows how easily it could
 have gone the other way.

Eisenhower , who later became President, and then British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill would have withdrawn the thousands of troops from the Normandy beaches rather than let them fight to the death

'The
 note certainly paints a picture of Eisenhower, while confident of 
success on D-Day, preparing for the worst case scenario as 150,000 men 
were preparing to land on the beaches.

'Had
 he had to use these notes on D-Day it would have meant that there would
 have been thousands of Allied casualties lying on the beaches of 
Normandy.

'It would have 
meant defeat for the Allies in the west and left Germany to focus all 
their efforts on the Russians on the Eastern Front, giving the Second 
World War a very different outcome.

Dwight D. Eisenhower, who became President in 1953, would have carried the can if D-Day in 1944 had been a failure

'It also would have ended Eisenhower's career as Supreme Allied Commander and probably the end Winston Churchill's government.'

Eisenhower was going to read the message out either to reporters or over the radio had D-Day ended in defeat.

The text, scribbled on a scrap of paper measuring 6ins by 4ins, reads: 'Our landings in the Cherbourg-Haver area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops.

'My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available.

'The troops, the air, and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.'

The message is dated July 5, 1944 - it is thought that he wrote the wrong month in error due to exhaustion.

It is said that before D-Day the Allied high command considered a successful landing would cost 10,000 dead.

In the event, the number of deaths were about 5,000. The majority of those were on Omaha Beach which was in the American sector.

Tim Rives, the deputy director of the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Kansas, US, said: 'To think that Eisenhower was willing to take the full blame should D-Day fail is quite telling of his character.

'It is an example of a leading taking responsibility.

'Winston Churchill's chief concern on D-Day was a bloodbath on the beaches and Eisenhower clearly felt the same as the plan was to withdraw rather than fight to the end.

'Eisenhower's adjutant officer was Captain Harry Butcher. About a month after D-Day Eisenhower pulled this note out of his wallet and showed it to Butcher who kept it.

'It was donated to the library in the 1980s by his family.'
