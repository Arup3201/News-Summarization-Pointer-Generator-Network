Max Clifford arriving at Southwark Crown Court to be sentenced for 8 indecent assaults on young women back in May

Disgraced publicist Max Clifford launched an appeal against his eight-year jail sentence yesterday.

Lawyers told the Court of Appeal the prison sentence was too long for the 71-year-old, who was convicted of eight indecent assaults against teenage girls and young women.

Richard Horwell QC said Clifford was ‘no longer a danger to women’ and would not commit any further offences.

He said the trial judge had been wrong to consider Clifford’s bizarre behaviour outside court when sentencing, when he stood behind a television presenter covering the trial and mimicked his broadcast.

And he said the judge at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Anthony Leonard QC, should not have imposed maximum two-year sentences for two of the indecent assaults after saying they were ‘not the gravest offences of their type’.

Mr Horwell told the Court of Appeal in London: ‘Although the sentencing process must reflect modern attitudes – and I fully accept that that is our law – the sentencing process must not abandon common sense and fairness.’

Clifford, who abused the young women and girls between 1977 and 1984, watched the court hearing on a videolink from HMP Littlehey, a Category C prison in Cambridgeshire.

He looked tired and gaunt and fidgeted during the 90-minute hearing, eventually complaining he could not hear one of the lawyers over the videolink.

Rosina Cottage QC, for the Crown, said the trial judge was entitled to impose the eight-year sentence.

She said Clifford’s public statements and denials after his arrest and during his trial had been intended to ‘manipulate, undermine and humiliate’ his victims.

Richard Horwell QC said Clifford was ‘no longer a danger to women’ and would not commit any more offences 

Clifford, of Hersham, Surrey, was prosecuted under 1956 legislation because his offences pre-dated the Sex Offences Act 2003. Under the more recent legislation he could have received a maximum life sentence, the Court of Appeal heard.

A decision on his application for leave to appeal against his sentence is due to be announced later this year.
