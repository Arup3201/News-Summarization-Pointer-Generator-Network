The newly inaugurated King Willem-Alexander might have dominated the headlines but for one group of Dutch revellers, a chance encounter with a British queen-in-waiting proved truly special.

While en route to the Amstel Hotel for an annual Queen's Day lunch with friends, socialite Morris Nieuwenhuis was thrilled to bump into 'Princess Camilla' aka the Duchess of Cornwall, who was taking a break from Royal celebrations.

'She was just walking around Amsterdam,' revealed Nieuwenhuis, 'and started chatting with us [about] how she loved the city, the party and the weather.'

'We were flabbergasted and loved [meeting] her,' he continued. 'Especially the orange hat she bought from a street vendor.

'She was really sweet, very open and approachable.

'Although she has been in the media a lot, I always thought she was a bit shy and uptight but on the contrary, she was very sweet.

'I asked if she was looking forward to the inauguration and all the festivities and she was and thought it was a special day.

'She bought an orange hat as a souvenir. We love Camilla!'

Although Camilla has developed a knack 
for dressing for the big occasion in recent years, she appeared happy 
and relaxed while walking around Amsterdam in a chic mint green coat and delicate beige scarf.

Nieuwenhuis, who was with celebrity stylist, Bastiaan van Schaik, fashion blogger Annic van Wonderer and estate agent Roosje de Vries when Camilla appeared, added:  '[I'd love to meet] Prince Harry - he's very hot! But also Queen 
Elizabeth.

'I think she must be a very sweet lady with a
big heart when one commits to a country like she does - just like our 
own Beatrix.

'After this beautiful day [the swearing in] I am very 
much looking forward to the coronation of your future King.

'The British are known for the ceremonial richness around the royals, although I
hope that the Queen remains for a few more years because she stole my 
heart at the Olympics.' 

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have spent the last few days in the Dutch capital for the swearing in of the newest European monarch.

The Netherland's King Willem-Alexander is the country's first male monarch in 123 years and ascended the throne after his mother, Queen Beatrix, abdicated.

His wife, Maxima, is now Queen Consort, while the couple's oldest daughter, Princess Catherine Amalia, becomes Princess of Orange and heir to the Dutch throne.

The event, which included a ball in 
honour of outgoing queen, Beatrix, a swearing in ceremony and a 
post-coronation dinner, was attended by a veritable who's who of crowned
heads.

Among them were 
some of Europe's most glamorous women, including Sweden's Crown Princess
Victoria to Princess Letizia of Spain and Denmark's Crown Princess 
Mary.

Also appearing at the
event was Hereditary Princess Sophie of Liechtenstein, who attended 
with her husband hereditary prince Alois, and Princess Mathilde of 
Belgium.

Male guests included Norway's dashing Crown Prince Haakon, who attended with his pretty blonde wife, Mette-Marit, and Crown Prince Billah of Brunei.

Denmark's Crown Prince Frederic also attended, wearing a beautifully tailored uniform and an eccentric naval hat.

Prince Charles  wore the Dutch Order of the Crown - a house order of the Dutch Royal House of Orange-Nassau, while Camilla sported the insignia of a Grand Dame Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.

Also seen entering Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kerk were Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako, and Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco, the princess consort of King Mohammed VI of Morocco.
