Barcelona's visit to Atletico Madrid was always going to be a feisty affair, but not many fans inside the Vicente Calderon would've expected to see a player launch his footwear at an official.

That's exactly what happened in the second half when, after having his boot removed in a tackle, Atleti midfielder Arda Turan decided to pick it up and chuck it at one of the game's two linesmen.

The Turkish international missed his target but, despite his intent being clear to everyone inside the stadium, referee Jesus Gil only showed him a yellow card.

Turan's frustration stemmed from a challenge by Dani Alves which left him wearing only one boot and the sending off of his midfield partner Gabi, who failed to reemerge for the second period after insulting referee Gil in the tunnel at half-time.

The former Galatasaray man was fortunate to avoid a second yellow shortly after his moment of madness when the ball struck his arm and Gil gave Barca a free-kick.

Atletico boss Diego Simeone then quickly withdrew him from the action, perhaps sensing that his side would be down to nine men if Turan was allowed to remain on the pitch. 

The incident occurred during a frantic Copa del Rey quarter final second leg which began with Fernando Torres making it 1-1 on aggregate with a goal inside the first minute.

Neymar made it 1-1 on the night when he finished off a fine pass from Luis Suarez, before Raul Garcia converted a controversial penalty for the hosts to get them back on level terms overall.

Luis Enrique's men then battled back superbly, with a Miranda own goal and another strike from Neymar before half-time giving them a comfortable 4-2 lead on aggregate.

There was more controversy late in the second half when Atleti midfielder Mario Suarez was dismissed after picking up two yellow cards, the second of which was for raking his studs down Lionel Messi's achilles. 

That did leave Simeone's side down to nine men and they were unable to get themselves back into the game as Barcelona progressed to the semi-finals.
