Pay-out: Playboy girl Stephanie Adams said she was left traumatised and injured when cops manhandled her after a cab driver told them she was carrying a gun

A former Playboy model has been awarded $1.2 million (£780,000)  after a Manhattan court ruled she was the victim of excessive force by the NYPD.

Stephanie Adams, 40, said she was left traumatised and injured when cops manhandled her after a cab driver told them she was carrying a gun.

'I waited six years for this,' an emotional Ms Adams said after the jury gave her $350,000 more than her lawyer had asked for, reported the New York Post.

Ms Adams was taking the taxi driven by Eric Darko on May 25 back her to apartment in New York when he refused to bring her any closer to her building, according to Ms Adams.

The first openly lesbian Playmate, testified that Darko 
started cursing and threatening her, so she called 911 for help.

He then also called them, but made up a tale that she had 
threatened to shoot him.

According to the New York Post, the driver, later told city investigators that he believed Ms Adams was a vampire.

Five officers were sent to the scene on high alert, and Ms Adams, had several guns pointed at her by plainclothes cops.

She
testified that they searched her bags and although she  following 
instructions to keep still  and keep her hands visible, one of them 
shoved her face
down in the street, and kept her there with pressure on her neck and 
her lower back.

Ms Adams, testified that during a ride her cab driver 
Eric Dakro (right) started cursing and threatening her, so she called 911 for help

He 'mashed my face,' she testified.

Sgt. 
John Rajan testified that she had obeyed his order not to move, but 
didn’t react when he told her to lie on the ground, so he had to make her
do so with 'a controlled drop to the ground.'

'We didn’t know if
she had a firearm,' Mr Rajan testified reported the New York Post.

But he hesitated when asked by trial lawyer Nina Neumunz why he hadn’t just put her up 
against a car or a wall to frisk her.

Ms Neumunz in court stated that the physical force was unnecessary with the tight-fitting clothing Ms Adams was wearing.

Defence: The city had contended police followed proper procedure and Ms Adams' claims of being traumatized by the incident were overblown. They cited the sexy pictures of the former centerfold with guns on her website

The
niece of a former New Jersey police commissioner, Ms Adams said she was
traumatized by the treatment by cops and by having guns pointed at her.

The city had contended police followed proper procedure and Ms Adams’ claims of being traumatized by the incident were overblown.

They cited the sexy pictures of the former centerfold with guns on her Web site, Goddessy.com.

One photos shows her behind the wheel of an NYPD patrol car,  and in others she’s shooting rifles.

A juror who wanted to remain anonymous said the pictures were 'a smokescreen,' and said that for the panel, the smoking gun was the spine and neck injuries the ex-model suffered in the incident.

'No one should be treated that way,' the juror said to the New York Post.

A doctor for Ms Adams testified during the trial saying the incident injured spinal discs causing her serious back pain.

'I’m very gratified,' said the former Playgirl model, adding that for her, the case wasn’t about cash, 'it was about justice.'

Ms Adams previously sued Mr Darko for falsely accusing her as armed during the 2006 incident, according to NJ.com, causing his license to be revoked by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission the same year.

He was also fined $2,700.

Ms Adams was featured as the Playboy centerfold for their November 1992 calendar.

She was the first and only playmate to declare herself a lesbian though years later become engaged to 'a loving, supportive, successful man,' she told the Post in 2009.

In 2004 she was named by the Village Voice as their 'Best NYC lesbian sex symbol.
