James Harding, former editor of the Times newspaper, is the BBC's new head of news on a salary of £340,000

The BBC has announced that the new head of news and current affairs will be the former editor of The Times Newspaper, James Harding.

Mr Harding will be on a salary of £340,000 as he takes over the post which was vacated by Helen Boaden who stepped aside in the wake of the Savile investigations and is now head of BBC Radio.

Mr Harding, 43, who resigned as editor
 of the paper in December after five years, will head the corporation’s huge news 
division, despite his lack of TV and radio experience.

His appointment is a radical move by 
the corporation which has been criticised for being dominated by 
executives who have little experience of the world outside the BBC.

This will make him one of the best 
paid and most powerful executives at the BBC and he is the latest in a 
string of senior appointments by new director general Tony Hall, which 
has also included former Labour culture secretary James Purnell.

Cambridge graduate Mr Harding resigned
 from The Times after five years in December and indicated to colleagues
 on the paper that its owners News Corporation had wanted him to go.

Mr Harding will head the BBC's news division, which employs more than 8,000 staff, and sit on the BBC's executive and management boards.

He
 said: 'The BBC's newsroom strives to be the best in the world, trusted 
for its accuracy, respected for its fairness and admired for the courage
 of its reporting. I am honoured to be a part of it.'

BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: 
'I am delighted that James will be joining as the new Director of BBC 
News and Current Affairs. High quality journalism sits right at the 
heart of the BBC making this is an absolutely critical role.

'James has a very impressive track 
record as a journalist, editor and manager. I believe he will give BBC 
News a renewed sense of purpose as it moves away from what has been an 
undeniably difficult chapter.

'As an organisation, the BBC will also
 benefit from his external perspective and experience which he will 
share as a member of the BBC’s Executive team.'

Before working at The Times, Harding held a number of international posts at the Financial Times.

Boaden's time in charge was 
scrutinised by the Pollard review, which said her division went into 
'virtual meltdown' during the scandal.

As director of news, Miss Boaden was responsible for more than 8,000 staff and was in charge of all of the broadcaster’s news and current affairs output, including Question Time, Panorama, the Today Programme and Newsnight.

Harding - who can speak English, 
French, German, Mandarin and Japanese - worked as a speechwriter in 
Japan before taking up a job at the Financial Times in 1994.

He opened the newspaper's Shanghai bureau before going on to become the Washington bureau chief, a job he held for three years.

In 2006 he started working at the 
Times as business editor before becoming overall editor - and at 38 the 
youngest person ever to do so - of the paper in 2007.

He was born in London and was educated at St. Paul's School before going on to study history at Trinity College, Cambridge.

He is the author of Alpha Dogs, How Political Spin Became a Global Business and is married to Kate with whome he has a son, Samuel.

 

It
 is known that she told Mr Entwistle – then running BBC TV – at an 
awards lunch last year that Newsnight was planning to run a report about
 claims that Savile abused young girls, which could affect Mr 
Entwistle’s plans for Christmas shows paying tribute to the presenter.

Sources
 at Newsnight also suggested that she warned the programme’s then 
editor, Peter Rippon – who has also since stepped aside – that he needed
 to be sure of his facts before screening any claims that Savile was a 
criminal.

Miss Boaden resumed her role as director of BBC News in December after further blunders - caused by a change in the chain of command in news while an inquiry was ongoing - led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly identified as being involved in a sexual abuse scandal.

After Boaden stepped aside, Fran Unsworth, 54, was temporarily made head of news and will hold the position until Harding starts in August.

In Ferbruary, former Labour cabinet minister James Purnell was made chief strategist at the BBC on a salary of £295,000 a year.

His appointment re-ignited concerns over the corporation's links with the Left with MPs claiming it was 'unprecedented' to have someone with such a politically active past become a senior BBC executive.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The amount of licence fee-payers' money paid to senior BBC bosses has long been excessive and it is a shame that this opportunity has not been taken reduce spending in this area.

'As families up and down the country have to tighten their belts, the Corporation needs to do the same and cutting down the executive pay bill is an obvious area for savings.'
