Convicted criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons after a landmark court ruling.

A High Court judge in London has declared that the 2006 Health Act, which prohibits lighting up in public and in workplaces, applies to all Crown premises, including prisons.

It comes after Mr Justice Singh rejected Justice Secretary Chris Grayling's argument that the Crown had immunity from the Act.

Criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons following a landmark ruling at the High Court in London 

However, the judge accepted his ruling had wide-ranging implications and said it should not take effect until Mr Grayling has had a chance to appeal.

The judge was told by Government lawyers that criminalising smoking could lead to unrest in the jails of England and Wales.

Prisoners can smoke in their cells with the door shut and outside in exercise yards, but both inmates and staff could face prosecution for lighting up in communal areas if the ruling is not overturned on appeal.

The case was brought by Paul Black, an inmate at HMP Wymott in Lancashire, who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second-hand smoke.

High Court judge Mr Justice Singh, pictured, made the ruling after rejecting the argument that Crown premises had immunity from the Health Act 2006, which bans smoking in public places and in workplaces

Lawyers for Black, a sex offender who has been at Wymott since 2009, argued both prisoners and staff were guilty of lighting-up in areas prohibited under prison rules, including on landings, in laundry rooms and in healthcare waiting rooms.

Lawyers for the Justice Secretary maintained the rules and regulations, especially the sanction of withdrawal of privileges, were sufficient to deal any problem.

The Health Act already applies to private prisons as they are not Crown premises.

Mr Justice Singh, sitting in London, declared: 'In my judgment it is clear from the terms of the 2006 Act that the intention of Parliament was indeed that it should apply to all public places and workplaces which fell within its scope, including those for which the Crown is responsible.'

But giving permission to appeal, the judge acknowledged concerns in the Prison Service over the impact of his decision on 'prisoners who feel the need to smoke and may be resistant to the criminalising of that conduct in places where in my view the Health Act does apply.'

Black had also argued that prisoners were legally entitled to anonymous and confidential access to the NHS freephone smoke-free compliance line to report infringements of the rules.

The judge said that issue should be reconsidered by the Justice Secretary in the light of his judgment.

Black is serving a sentence of indeterminate detention for public protection (IPP) after being convicted in 2007 of sexual assault and outraging public decency.

His minimum term in jail expired after 203 days but he cannot be released on licence until the Parole Board decides he is no longer a danger to the public.

Black's solicitor Sean Humber, head of the Prison Law Team at Leigh Day, said: 'The judgment confirms that the legal restrictions on smoking apply every bit as much in prisons as in the public places and workplaces in the wider community.

'The judgment is important in confirming that prisoners are entitled to the same level of protection from the risks posed by second-hand smoke as everyone else.'

However, a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said; 'Prison cells in England remain exempt from the smoke-free legislation that came into effect in 2007.

'Since that time we have introduced a number of measures to reduce the risk of exposure of staff and prisoners to second-hand smoke. We are undertaking additional measures to continue to lessen the impact of smoking in prisons.

'This includes tightening our current smoking controls, undertaking air quality monitoring in prison accommodation, and maximising the provision of smoking cessation support to those prisoners who want to stop smoking.'
