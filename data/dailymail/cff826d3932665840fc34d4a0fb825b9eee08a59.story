Even by his own standards, it’s a little … outlandish.

Morrissey’s latest proclamation? War is a ‘heterosexual hobby’, and it wouldn’t exist if more men were gay.

The outspoken former frontman of The Smiths, who has previously criticised the Royal Family and branded the Chinese a ‘subspecies’, said war stemmed from heterosexual men’s passion for killing each other.

Big mouth strikes again: Morrissey told a U.S. magazine if more men were gay there would be no wars

Morrissey, 53, said: ‘War, I thought, was the most negative aspect of male heterosexuality.

‘If more men were homosexual, there would be no wars, because homosexual men would never kill other men, whereas heterosexual men love killing other men. They even get medals for it. Women don’t go to war to kill other women.'

‘Wars and armies and nuclear weapons are essentially heterosexual hobbies.’

The singer, whose real name is Steven Morrissey, made the comments in Rookie, an American online magazine for teenage girls.

His remarks show little regard for 
history.  Military leaders known or believed to be gay include Alexander
the Great, Julius Caesar, Field Marshal Montgomery and Hermann Goering.

Today, 45 countries allow homosexuals to serve openly in their armed forces, including the US, Canada and France.

Countries which ban homosexuals from serving in the military include Iran, Egypt and Syria. Morrissey has made headlines in the past for his controversial views, attracting the most attention for his anti-meat comments.

He called the Chinese a ‘subspecies’ for their treatment of animals and claimed that Anders Breivik’s massacre of 97 people in Norway in 2011 was ‘nothing compared to what happens in McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried sh** every day’.

And last year, he attacked the Royal Family following the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who was the victim of a hoax call from an Australian radio station while the Duchess of Cambridge was in hospital with an acute form of morning sickness.

He accused the royals of ‘absolutely staggering’ arrogance and said Kate ‘feels no shame’.
