UK defence cuts risk leaving America to tackle the twin threat of Russia and ISIS on its own, it has been claimed. 

Retired British army chief General Richard Dannatt suggested there was ‘no-one else’ for the US to turn to in Europe.

It comes days after a UK think tank predicted that up to 30,000 British service personnel could go leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade.

Now there are fears the United States could be left without a credible partner as it stands up to a number of global security threats.

Lord Dannatt, who served as Chief of the General Staff between 2006 and 2009, told the Washington Post: ‘If the UK can’t do it, who else is the US going to turn to in Europe? There’s no one else.’

He added: ‘The concern is that we’re going to fall from being a significant player to a bit-part player. 

‘The UK isn’t of much use to the US if we don’t have a worthwhile military force behind us. Anybody can talk tough. But if you don’t back it up, everyone just laughs at you.’

The comments come a week after the US Army chief of staff General Ray Odierno revealed he was ‘very concerned’ about cuts in the British military.

Earlier this week, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, warned of a ‘dangerous’ gulf emerging between American and European spending on defence.

She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that governments in Europe needed to spend more and that cuts around the continent were ‘concerning’.

A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of Britain’s forces face redundancy over the next parliament.

It comes as Prime Minister David Cameron faces calls to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP.

The 2013-14 defence budget was £34.3billion, down from £35.9billion in 2010-11, when the coalition took over.

It comes after a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was inevitable that Britain's defence spending would drop below the Nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts.
