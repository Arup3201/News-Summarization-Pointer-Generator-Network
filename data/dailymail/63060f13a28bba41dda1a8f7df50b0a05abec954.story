Troy Deeney’s hat-trick eased the pressure on manager Slavisa Jokanovic as Watford put in five star performance at Fulham to end a run of four successive defeats.

In a week that all clubs are coming together to mark the Christmas Day truce during the First World War, Watford showed they were in no mood to extend that good feeling a century later as they climbed to sixth in the Championship thanks to Deeney’s treble and two from Almen Abdi.

Jokanovic said: 'It is a very good day for us and we made close to a perfect performance

'We are starting a job and other people exist who decide if this is with enough quality or not.'

Watford were the better team from the start and Daniel Tozer tested Marcus Bettinelli in the Fulham goal with a curling free-kick which had the England U21 keeper at full stretch to tip the ball over the bar.

And minutes later Tozer was playing provider as his long ball found Deeney who headed the ball over the on-rushing Bettinelli but Kostos Stafylidis was able to get back to clear the ball off the line.

But Watford did take the lead minutes later when Abdi’s low free-kick went through Deeney’s legs in the wall and wrong-footed Bettinelli to give the Hornets a deserved lead.

Things went from bad to worse for Fulham after Bettinelli was shown a red card for bringing down Matej Vydra and conceding a penalty.

Veteran keeper Gabor Kiraly came off the bench, but could do nothing to stop Deeney doubling Watford’s lead from the spot.

And the game was over before the break when Deeney grabbed his second of the game.

Gianni Munari cushioned header played in Deeney who was alert to beat the offside trap and touch the ball through Kiraly’s legs. 

And the visitors showed no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half as they scored fourth, and best, goal of the night shortly after the break.

Nothing looked on as Vyddra played the ball to Abdi, but the Swiss midfielder looked up and fired a shot from 30 yards which arrowed into the top corner leaving Kiraly to look on helplessly.

Deeney completed his hat-trick with the final kick of the game when he slotted past Kiraly after latching onto a through ball from Munari.

The defeat was Kit Symons’ heaviest in his short spell as Fulham manager and only his second loss at home in the league since replacing Felix Magath in September.

Symons said: ‘You have to try and learn from it. There is quite a lot we can learn. It is obvious there is a lot of hard work and improvement to be done.

‘Down to 10 and 2-0 down it is a mountain to climb. I said to the players at half-time what we cant do is feel sorry for ourselves and let our heads drop. I thought we showed character second-half.
