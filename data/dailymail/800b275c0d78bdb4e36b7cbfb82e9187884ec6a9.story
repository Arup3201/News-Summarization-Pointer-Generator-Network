Three police officers were last night accused of using ‘weasel words’ after they denied lying to help bring down former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell.

Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones yesterday issued a partial apology for their conduct following a meeting with Mr Mitchell at the height of the ‘Plebgate’ row last year.

But they pointedly did not apologise to the former Government chief whip himself.

Friends of Mr Mitchell said their statement did not go far enough and called for them to face disciplinary proceedings.

Former shadow home secretary David Davis said: ‘After bringing down a Cabinet minister, a half-apology won’t do. These people are guilty of a serious misconduct.’

Mr Mitchell admits losing his temper and swearing after police guarding the gates of Downing Street stopped him riding his bicycle through the gates on a September evening last year.

But he has always denied using the toxic word ‘plebs’, as claimed in a ‘police log’ leaked to the media.

A secret recording made by Mr Mitchell of the meeting with the three officers in his Sutton Coldfield constituency last October reveals them apparently accepting his account of the incident.

But just minutes later the three, all senior members of the Police Federation, told reporters that he had failed to explain what had happened and called for him to resign.

Statement: Chris Jones, Stuart Hinton and Ken McKaill, pictured leaving the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, today issued a half-hearted apology for talking to the media

On October 12 last year Andrew Mitchell met three members of the Police Federation to discuss the 'Plebgate' case.

A tape recording of the reveals Mr Mitchell going to great lengths to explain what happened in Downing Street.

He
said: 'I did not say and I give you my word, I give you my word, I did 
not call an officer an f'ing pleb I did not say you are an f'ing moron 
and I did not say you should know your f'ing place.

'I would never speak to anyone like that least of all a police officer and you have my word I never said those things.'

Later
Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton said to Mr Mitchell: 'I appreciate your candour, and we 
appreciate you have gone beyond what you said in, to the media.'

But
minutes later outside the meeting, Inspector Ken MacKaill, from West 
Mercia Police, accused Mr Mitchell of refusing to give any more detail 
of the incident.

Mr MacKaill said: 'I think Mr Mitchell has no option but to resign.

'He is continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. I think his position is untenable.'

The three men were controversially cleared of misconduct last week following an internal investigation by West Mercia Police.

But, in an extraordinary intervention, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said the investigation was wrong to clear them.

In a statement yesterday the three officers apologised for talking to the media, but denied lying.

‘The reputation of, and public confidence in, the police service is of immense concern to each of us,’ they said.

‘We acknowledge the investigation’s criticism relating to our poor judgment in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise.

'We would like to emphasise that in no way did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred during this meeting or otherwise.’

But friends of Mr Mitchell dismissed the statement.

Mr Davis said: ‘The transcript of the meeting shows that the federation deployed a premeditated line of attack against Mr Mitchell.

'This is not a case of misjudgment, it is deliberate misconduct and they should face the consequences of that misconduct.’

Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘These weasel words are no substitute for proper accountability of sworn officers for what the IPCC deemed a deliberate lie intended to bring down an elected Cabinet minister in pursuit of a political agenda.’

Tomorrow, the chief constables of the West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire forces, which employ the three officers, will be grilled by MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Committee.

David Shaw, chief constable of the West Mercia force, will be pressed on revelations from the IPCC that the internal inquiry’s conclusions were changed at the eleventh hour to clear the three.

Mr Cameron led calls for Mr Mitchell to receive a full apology from the three senior officers.

Doubts: CCTV footage of the original exchange between Mr Mitchell and police officers at the gates of Downing Street raised questions about the official police log

Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, he said the issue at stake was not what happened at the gates of Downing Street but the subsequent meeting.

He told MPs: 'The former chief whip had a meeting with Police Federation officers in his committee where he gave a full account of what had happened, they left that meeting and claimed he had given them no account at all.

'Fortunately this meeting was recorded so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue.'

Home Secretary Theresa May also condemned the officers, warning the issue struck at the heart of public trust in the police.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed the three police officers met Mr Mitchell with ‘one intention in mind’ — to end his political career.
