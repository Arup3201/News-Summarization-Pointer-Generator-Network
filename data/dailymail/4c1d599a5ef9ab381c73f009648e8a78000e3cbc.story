An extraordinary collection of propaganda posters from the Second World War reveals how the authorities aimed to convince the public that Britain was bound to defeat the Nazis.

The historic artworks blare out the message that 'victory of the Allies is assured' - but still urged Britons to hoard their kitchen waste for farm animals and keep a sharp eye out for foreign spies.

The rousing posters, some of which are written in French and Portuguese, are being sold at auction later this month and are expected to fetch around £7,000.

Mixed messages: Some propaganda from the Second World War emphasised the strength of the Allies, but others urged Britons to remain thrifty

Warning: One series of posters shows Britons chatting about the war overheard by nefarious characters, and a deadly results of 'careless talk'

Multi-lingual: Most of the posters are aimed at the British themselves, but others aim to reach allies by using foreign languages such as Catalan, right

They show fictional scenes such as Allied tanks destroying their Nazi opponents, marine commandos storming an occupied village and RAF bombers striking German factories.

Others feature the capture of a German U-Boat and a British navy cruiser ramming an Italian submarine.

A series of posters aimed at the UK's French allies, many of whom had little idea about the progress of the war, says: 'The fall of the dictators is assured'.

British citizens were urged to save scraps of food to feed to chickens, and set up clubs to breed pigs.

And chilling images from the famous 'careless talk costs lives' campaign dramatise the deadly consequences of being overheard discussing war plans.

Quirky: These posters urge thrifty householders to recycle their kitchen scraps so they could be fed to pigs which would then be slaughtered

Boast: Many of the posters are aimed at convincing Allied citizens that their armies were much stronger than the Axis posters

Attractive: Some of the well-designed posters appeal for help for the Merchant Navy, which was vital in maintaining Allied supply lines

Moral support: Some of the posters produced by the Ministry of Information urge members of the public to show their support for the troops

Some of the posters have come from an archive belonging to Edwin Embleton, head of the Ministry of Information department responsible for producing the patriotic artwork.

The collection of around 30 posters is going under the hammer at Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset on December 20.

Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'These propaganda posters are a fascinating reminder of the lengths the Ministry of Information went to to boost moral among troops and civilians.

'They are cartoon-like and all of them depict strong images of the Allies beating the Nazis.

'A lot of the posters would have been sent abroad to places like unoccupied France, Spain and Malta where troops would have had little idea of how the war was going in other areas.

On sale: The evocative posters are expected to fetch £7,000 when they go up for auction in Dorset next week

Chilling: These images dramatically illustrate how damaging the consequences of talking about the war effort could be

Thanks: The Merchant Navy launched a propaganda campaign to highlight its own importance to the war effort

'They would have served as little newsflashes to reassure soldiers that the Allies were winning the war.

'In some cases they would have been sent out when things were looking grim for the Allies as a way of boosting moral.

'A chunk of the posters concentrated on the Home Guard - those who stayed behind to keep the country running.

'Every citizen was expected to do their bit for the war effort and so posters were put up on hoardings and in bus and railway stations urging them to do so.

'The "dig for victory" campaign was designed to get people to be self sufficient and part of that was rearing chickens and pigs.

'Some of the more charming posters urge people to start "pig clubs" and feed food scraps to chickens.

Artistic: The posters are mostly based on evocative paintings paired with striking and readable text

Back them up: The heroic image of inevitable victory projected by the posters was somewhat misleading given the ups and downs of the war

'However, the "careless talk costs lives" series was probably the most successful propaganda campaign of the war.

'These days social networking makes it almost impossible to control information but back then the Ministry of Information was very keen to keep a tight lid on things.

'Posters were put up in public places including pubs and village halls with very obvious warnings not to gossip about anything to do with the war.

'To deter people the posters showed the scenes of devastation that would certainly have come true had Hitler gotten wind of any gossip.

'There is a very strong market for war posters and we expect there to be lots of interest in the sale.'
