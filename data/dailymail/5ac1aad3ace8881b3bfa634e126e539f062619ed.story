Fighter: Kay Coombes lost her father Peter and brother Paul. Her other brother Steve is one of the missing Cheeki Rafiki yachtsmen

Barely able to sleep and surviving on little more than biscuits, adrenalin and hope, Kay Coombes can’t help but wonder how much more her family – beset by one appalling loss after another – can bear.

Her adored father Peter died from a brain aneurism at the age of 49; then in 2008, her brother Paul, 44, died in his sleep after a blood clot travelled to his heart.

Two years ago, Kay was diagnosed with breast cancer. Now, just when she thought the worst was behind them, this.

Kay’s brother, Steve Warren, 52, is one of four British yachtsmen lost at sea, with hope of finding them alive dwindling by the hour. The US Coastguard said the massive search operation will be called off at 5am today.

‘Right now, it feel as if ours must be the most unlucky family in the world,’ says Kay, 46, a civil servant and divorced mother of one from Bridgwater, Somerset.

‘Our poor mother Margaret is in a terrible state. In the space of six years she’s had to cope with the prospect of losing all three of her children.’

Experienced yachtsman Steve was a crew member on the 40ft yacht Cheeki Rafiki, which was lost just over a week ago after running into difficulties 620 miles east of Massachusetts, while sailing to the UK.

The yacht, returning from a regatta in Antigua, began taking on water last Thursday and alerted the authorities at 3.15am local time. At 4.20am, a beacon attached to one of the men’s lifejackets emitted an electronic distress call, followed by another one at 6.57am.

Since then there has been no confirmed sighting of the yacht or the men – Steve, his best friend Paul Goslin, 56, James Male, 23, and skipper Andrew Bridge, 22.

In the cruellest of ironies, it was the death of his brother and his sister’s battle with cancer that made Steve determined to ‘live for the moment’, seizing the opportunity to join the crew of the Cheeki Rafiki for a ‘trip of a lifetime’.

To lose one sibling is devastating enough, but to contemplate losing her other brother has been almost too much for Kay to bear.

But just as Steve was there for her in times of desperate need, so she summoned up all her reserves to fight for him, rather than give up and accept the worst.

She has made it her mission to make sure everything possible has been done to find him.

‘I’m convinced Steve is still alive,’ Kay told me.

‘Even if there’s just a 1 per cent chance of finding him alive, that’s the chance I’m clinging to.’

Kay knows time is running out and with each passing day it becomes harder to hold on to those positive, comforting images of her larger-than-life brother.

‘I have to be realistic. It’s a long 
shot, but we need to do everything we can,’ she said. ‘I just don’t want
 to think of losing Steve, but if I never see him again, at least I can 
know that we did everything in our power to find him.’

Race against time: The US Coast Guard said the search for Steve Warren, 44, will be called off at 5am

Kay and her brothers were always close and she and Steve even more so after Paul’s death. She simply cannot imagine life without him.

‘Paul’s death hit the family very hard, because it was so unexpected,’ Kay said. ‘Paul’s death was a wake-up call and completely changed the way Steve looked at life. He was determined to live for the moment and grasp every opportunity.’

Kay added: ‘He was there for me when I needed him and now I have to be there for him. Steve knows I’ll be fighting for him.

‘I’m a fighter. I’ve had breast cancer and I’ve had a double mastectomy. I am a strong woman.

‘Cancer had no chance with me. I’m still here to tell the tale.

‘I need to know that I fought as hard to save Steve’s life too.’
