An eighth-grade math teacher and father-of-one has mysteriously dropped dead while on a school field trip.

Jim Benton, who taught at Grassland Middle School in Franklin, Tennessee, was among seven adults chaperoning about 75 students on the excursion to Williamsburg, Virginia.

He became suddenly ill on Monday after returning from the day's activities and was taken to a local hospital where he died shortly after, the school confirmed. The cause of death is unknown.

Mr Benton was in his early 30's and had moved to the Nashville area with his wife, Meredith, and baby daughter after being hired by the school over the summer, according to Tennessean.com.

In a tribute, Grassland Middle School principal Lily Leffler said Mr Benton was a 'dynamic' teacher who was adored by his students and had quickly blended in with the community.

'Although new to Grassland, he quickly became a beloved colleague in the community,' she told the newspaper. 'He was such a funny guy, and he will be greatly missed.'

Beloved teacher: Students and parents learned of Mr Benton's death on Monday evening through an automated call

Students and parents learned of Mr Benton's death on Monday evening through an automated call. Grief counselors will be in his classroom this week to help students deal with the news.

A Facebook tribute page has been set up to remember Mr Benton, and scores of condolences are pouring in from students and their parents, most describing the man as their favourite teacher.

'Mr B was the teacher who was your friend and biggest fan from the first day you met him to the last day when you said goodbye for the year,' Josh Bock wrote.

'But his support and love for his students never stopped there, if he ever saw you at school he would stop whatever he was doing and say hi. He would make you feel special and could brighten any of your darkest day with a simple smile and a "hey kiddo, what's up?"

'He collected joy from seeing others succeed and genuinely cared about every person that came to him. RIP Mr. B you shall never be forgotten.'

County director of schools Mike Looney told Tennessean.com the tragedy had left him speechless. 'What can you say,' he said. 'There are no words to describe something like this.'
