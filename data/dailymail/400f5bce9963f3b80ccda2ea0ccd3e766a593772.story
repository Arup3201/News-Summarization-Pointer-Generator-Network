President Obama faced allegations of a major political cover-up last night over the resignation of CIA chief General David Petraeus, who had an affair with a married woman.

Congress is expected to investigate claims that the affair was hushed up to protect Obama’s re-election campaign.

It is believed the affair was discovered by the FBI months ago, but not made public until after the election. 

Disgraced: General Petraeus with his mistress Paula Broadwell

Cover-up? If it is discovered the Petraeus affair was kept quite so as to not disrupt Obama's Presidential campaign, Barack may face some tough questioning

A Woman Scorned? It is being claimed that the affair between David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell emerged after she sent threatening emails to Ms Kelley

The FBI began an investigation  in February after discovering the  60-year-old’s computer had been accessed by someone else - believed to be his 40-year-old mistress Paula Broadwell - prompting fears of a major security breach.

This led to the discovery of hundreds of explicit emails including one referring to ‘sex under a desk.'

A source said last night: ‘The real question is, what did the President know, and when?’

Frances Townsend, a former  senior US government security official and now a member of the CIA Advisory Committee, said: ‘Whenever the FBI opens an investigation of a senior official they have to make notification of that, especially if there is an intelligence concern.

'It is hard to believe the White House did not know about this prior to the election.’

White House officials insist the President did not know of the affair until last Wednesday, the day after the election.

He accepted the retired four-star general’s resignation on Thursday, and the announcement was made on Friday.

Some have alleged the scandal is a smokescreen to stop Petraeus testifying before a Senate committee this week into the deaths of the US ambassador and three staff members in September in Benghazi, Libya.

The White House has been accused of ignoring repeated warnings of an Al Qaeda terrorist attack on the embassy.

A senior Congressional staffer said last night: 'What would he have told us? The resignation is incredibly convenient for the administration. Would he have revealed the CIA knew the Benghazi compound was under threat and Washington did nothing to secure it?'

Members of the House Intelligence Committee may still vote to subpoena Petraeus and force him  to testify.

The source added: ‘This could be another Watergate situation where it is not the event that brings down the president but the cover-up.’

Mother-of-two Broadwell began an affair with Petraeus, married to his wife Holly for 37 years, when she was with him in Afghanistan in 2010 doing research for her biography, All In: The Education Of General David Petraeus.

She says they ‘bonded’ over push-ups and five-mile runs in the deserts of Afghanistan. ‘That was the foundation of our relationship. He goes all in to what he does,’ she said.

Petraeus led American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq before taking charge of the CIA.
