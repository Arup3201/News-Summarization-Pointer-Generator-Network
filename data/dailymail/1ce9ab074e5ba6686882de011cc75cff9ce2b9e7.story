Memory loss: Forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40, scientists have said

Forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40, scientists have said.

Experts have found that cognitive decline speeds up once people reach middle age, however, they are working on a solution to the problem.

They believe the answer lies in the NDMA receptors in the brain, in particular the receptors GluN2B subunits which help people to remember things.

These subunits start to be lost among small children, and by the time a person reaches retirement age they will have around half the amount of someone much younger.

Separate this loss from more serious problems like dementia and Alzheimer's disease, virtually everyone loses memory-making and cognitive abilities as they age.

Researchers at the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University have clarified that cognitive decline with age is a natural part of life and are searching hard to find ways of slowing it.

'These are biological processes, and once we fully understand what is going on, we may be able to slowÂ  or prevent it,' said Kathy Magnusson, a neuroscientist in the OSU Department of Biomedical Sciences and professor in the Linus Pauling Institute.

'There may be ways to influence it with diet, health habits, continued mental activity or even drugs.'

Professor Magnusson added: 'The NMDA receptor has been known of for decades. It plays a role in memory and learning but isn't active all the time, it takes a fairly strong stimulus of some type to turn it on and allow you to remember something.

'The routine of getting dressed in the morning is ignored and quickly lost to the fog of time, but the day you had an auto accident earns a permanent etching in your memory.'

Within the NMDA receptor are various subunits, and research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, keeps pointing back to the GluN2B subunit as one of the most important.

Knowledge: Infants and children have lots of GluN2B subunits, and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things

Infants and children have lots of them, and as a result are like a sponge in soaking up memories and learning new things.

But they gradually dwindle in number with age, and it also appears the ones that are left work less efficiently.

She said: 'You can still learn new things and make new memories when you are older, but it's not as easy.

'Fewer messages get through, fewer connections get made, and your brain has to work harder.'

Scientists have used a genetic therapy in laboratory mice, in which a virus helped carry complementary DNA into appropriate cells and restored some GluN2B subunits.

Tests showed that it helped mice improve their memory and cognitive ability.

Slowing the process: The best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain, and get physical exercise

However such gene therapy would probably be a last choice for humans, rather than a first option, as dietary or drug options would be explored first.

Professor Magnusson said: 'Until more specific help is available, some of the best advice for maintaining cognitive function is to keep using your brain.

'Break old habits, do things different ways. Get physical exercise, maintain a good diet and ensure social interaction.

'Such activities help keep these subunits active and functioning.

'The one thing that does seem fairly clear is that cognitive decline is not inevitable, it's biological.

'We're finding out why it happens, and it appears there are ways we might be able to slow or stop it, perhaps repair the NMDA receptors. If we can determine how to do that without harm, we will.'
