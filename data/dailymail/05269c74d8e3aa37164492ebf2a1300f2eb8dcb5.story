Former Liverpool defender John-Arne Riise has picked his #one2eleven of stars he has played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club.

It is no surprise that Riise's team is dominated by Liverpool players past and present, as the left back played in the side that won the 2005 Champions League.

But World Cup winner and Roma's long-standing captain Francesco Totti gets a worthwhile mention with team-mate Daniele De Rossi, and Fulham's Kieran Richardson also gets a look in too. 

Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. 

John-Arne Riise said his former Liverpool team-mate Pepe Reina (centre) was 'always trying to make jokes'

GOALKEEPER: Pepe Reina

'He's the funny one. He's always trying to make jokes and has so much confidence in himself, which to be a goalkeeper you really need to have.'

RIGHT-BACK: Steve Finnan

'The most calm person I've ever seen; never stressed. Not the most defensive right back but I really enjoyed playing with him and never seemed to make any big mistakes.' 

The quartet of (left to right) Sami Hyypia, Jamie Carragher, Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard were all included

DEFENDER: Jamie Carragher 

'I remember one game against Blackburn [in 2003] and he broke his leg. He didn't want to get carried off, he wanted to walk off. He wanted to carry on playing. He's a proper, proper defender. He's an easy choice. Best defender I've ever played with.

DEFENDER: Sami Hyypia

'Great right foot. Great left foot. Good in the air because he's 2 metres tall. Read the game perfectly. One of the nicest guys I've ever met in football.'

Ex-Fulham team-mate Kieran Richardson took up a place as left back as Javier Mascherano also featured 

LEFT BACK: Kieran Richardson

'He was a machine. Very quick, strong, powerful, offensive, defensive. Even if you pass him he was so quick at turning he'd catch you up again. He gave me a big fight [for my position].'

DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Javier Mascherano

'He's a dog. I know the opposition hated playing him because he's always on your toes and always tackling you.'

DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Daniele De Rossi

'Sees openings and passes that maybe not many other players could see. He will go down as one of Roma's greatest players.' 

Riise (second right) described his 2005 Champions League winning skipper Gerrard as 'the perfect captain'

DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Xabi Alonso 

'Probably the pass master. Nobody can pass the ball like him. I remember on his debut at Anfield, it probably took him about 39 minutes before he misplaced a pass. Unbelievable player.' 

MIDFIELD: Steven Gerrard 

'Best player I've played with without a doubt. I'm really privileged to have played with him because Stevie will go down as the greatest of all time. He's an amazing person also and for me he was the perfect captain.'

Roma legend Francesco Totti (left) was one of three non-Liverpool players to be named in Riise's dream team

STRIKER: Francesco Totti

'The God of Rome. I've never seen anything like it. As a football player he's not quick and he's 38-years old now but he has his technique and ambition, and a touch that's God's gift.' 

STRIKER: Fernando Torres 

'He has got a bit of stick since he left Liverpool and still has to come back to his best form, but while I was there he was a scoring machine. I think the pressure was too much for him at Chelsea. I think it got to him a little bit and it was too much to handle. I think he's back where he belongs [at Atletico Madrid].'
