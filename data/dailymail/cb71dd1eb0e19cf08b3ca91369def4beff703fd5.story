Ramzi Yousef, who planned and carried out the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured 1,000 others, has been held in isolation for more than a decade.

The 44-year-old Pakistani national has been held in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal Supermax prison Colorado since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

But he is now asking to be let out of solitary - because he's 'lonely'.

Despite the World Trade Center attack, a bombing of a Thai airliner, a plot to kill the Pope and a string of other plots -- Yousef's lawyer now claims that his client is 'no longer a threat.'

Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef bragged that he was a terrorist at his sentencing in 1998. Now he says he's lonely

Damage: This is the hole that was blown in the basement of the World Trade Center by the truck bomb Yousef detonated

Attorney Bernard Kleinman wants the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan to let him gather facts from prosecutors about why Ramzi Yousef remains held under the strictest security measures 15 years after they were first imposed. The three-judge panel did not immediately rule.

'I think it's just plain unfair,' Kleinman said outside court. 'Most of the terrorists he knew are either dead or in jail.'

Yousef was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted in the February 1993 attack that killed six people and injured hundreds of others and in a plot to bomb 12 American airliners over the Far East. He fled to the Middle East the night of the bombing and was captured two years later in Pakistan, where he was turned over to the FBI. He now lives in a 7-foot by 11-foot cell with a radio, a television, a desk, a toilet and a shower, Kleinman said.

Since 1997, he has been subjected to special administrative measures reserved for prisoners who are believed to be a continuing threat to the country. Kleinman said he is challenging the grounds under which the government continues to impose the severe restrictions on Yousef.

Catastrophic: Yousef had hoped the bomb blast would collapse the one tower into the other and bring both crumbling down

Wounded: More than 1,000 people were injured in the World Trade Center attack

The restrictions prevent Yousef from communicating with other prisoners and only allow him to meet with his lawyer, Kleinman said. For those visits, the last of which occurred in October 2010, Yousef is shackled and forced to communicate through Plexiglass.

Yousef is a nephew of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who has conceded in a written statement that he directed the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

Kleinman said Yousef's prison conditions were tightened even more after the September 11 attacks so that he was no longer housed near notorious criminals including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma City bombing conspirators Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh. McVeigh was executed while Nichols is serving life in prison.

At his 1998 sentencing, Yousef defiantly proclaimed: 'Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.'

Kleinman said he knows his client is 'not a sympathetic character' and that there are 'legitimate hard feelings against him.'

But he added that he hopes to eventually get the severe prison conditions loosened so that Yousef can have fewer restrictions on his communications with family, including his wife and two daughters.

'The human interaction is really a big issue for him,' Kleinman said. 'He recognizes he'll be in jail the rest of his life.'
