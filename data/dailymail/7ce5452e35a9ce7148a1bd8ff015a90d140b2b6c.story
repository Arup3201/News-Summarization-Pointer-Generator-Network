Jurgen Klopp insists Borussia Dortmund have plenty to be positive about despite dropping two points late on against Wolfsburg due to a 'stupid' equaliser.

Ciro Immobile looked to have given the hosts a welcome three points as he struck 14 minutes from time, but they were pegged back deep into stoppage time as Naldo rose unchallenged from a corner to head home.

As a result Dortmund remain deep in trouble at the bottom of the table, occupying the Bundesliga relegation play-off spot with half the season already completed.

Klopp remains defiant about his side's chances though, telling reporters: 'We are still alive, still fighting. 

'To pull it off against such an opponent was still good, even if it was stupid to conceded an equaliser from a corner.

'We both had good opportunities. Some of ours came from some sensational play by Ciro Immobile.

'He has absolute quality in the penalty area and he showed that today: he finished one nicely, set up another, and had two good chances where [Diego] Benaglio stopped it.

'Whether you're first or fifth, a 2-2 against Wolfsburg is not a bad result. 

'The match today was absolutely positive in many areas. We can build on it.'
