Aston Villa have made a shock deadline day bid for Real Sociedad playmaker Sergio Canales.

The 23-year-old is a former Real Madrid prospect and would add to Paul Lambert's thin midfield options.

Karim El Ahamadi is heading out of the Villa Park exit door, while Manchester United's Tom Cleverley is stalling on a move.

Now Lambert is looking to the former Spain under-21 international to inject some guile into his midfield.

Canales joined Real Sociedad last summer after a three-year stay at Valencia following his departure from Real.

His time with Real was hampered by injury having been touted as one of Spain’s top prospects.

Canales played in Sociedad’s incredible 4-2 comeback win over his former side Real on Sunday evening.
