Paranoid schizophrenic Harry Street, 70, originally called Barry Williams, had a fatal heart attack at high-security Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside

A mass killer who gunned down five people in a one-day 'orgy of terror' and then planned another rampage when he was freed has died behind bars.

Paranoid schizophrenic Harry Street, 70, originally called Barry Williams, had a fatal heart attack at high-security Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside on Christmas Eve.

The gun fanatic opened fire on three neighbours in 1978 following a long-running dispute over noise and then killed an elderly couple at a petrol station in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.

He was detained indefinitely in Broadmoor after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in March 1979 – but was released just 15 years later.

Last year it emerged that neighbours Warren and Sharee Smith complained to police about a five-year campaign of harassment which had chilling similarity to the dispute decades earlier.

When police raided the Birmingham home Street shared with wife Beverley and daughter Amy, 18, they found six guns, a homemade bomb and more than 50 bullets.

He was again detained indefinitely by a judge who said a tragedy had been missed by only a 'narrow margin' and Street threatened to blow up Mr Smith's family after his release.

Mr Smith told the Sunday Mirror: 'I feel shock but also relief. He was a very clever guy - he played the system and serious mistakes have been made. 

'We actually got on well with his wife and daughter, and I do feel sorry for them. We were very, very lucky as I know that something was about to happen before his arrest.'

He spoke of his anger that the killer had been allowed to change his name and that police had no idea of the dangerous history of their 'nuisance neighbour'.

Street went on a rampage in 1978 killing neighbours George Burkitt, 48, his wife Iris Burkitt, 47, and their 20-year-old son Philip after a day out drinking whisky.

The couple's teenage daughter, Jill Burkitt, who was 17 at the time, was left with serious gun wounds after she was hit in the back and thigh by five bullets at her West Bromwich home.

The gun fanatic's merciless killing spree in 1978 claimed five lives and prompted front-page headlines which shocked Britain

After hearing Street had died, Ms Burkitt told The Sun on Sunday: 'The devil has gone back to hell. 

'It was always my fear that one day he'd be released again and hunt me down.

'No one likes to hear of anyone dying but in his case it was best.' 

It emerged that Street, then aged 34, had a firearms certificate for a semi-automatic weapon he used legitimately at gun club ranges after the shootings in 1978.

Following his arrest by officers who overpowered him, more than 900 live bullet cartridges and a 0.22-calibre pistol were found stashed inside Street's Ford Capri.

Two charges of attempted murder were ordered to lie on the file by a judge at Stafford Crown Court in March 1979, who described Street's crimes as a 'dreadful series of events' driven by mental illness.

He was detained under mental health laws in 1979 for the manslaughters, but was released 15 years later

Psychiatric experts told the court Street had an active paranoid psychosis requiring hospital treatment.

Street's release, after he was deemed safe to be returned to the community, also attracted significant media attention.

A decision in 1994 to allow him to live in a bail hostel around six miles away from the scene of the West Bromwich shootings was described as 'crass, insensitive and dangerous' by a local MP.

One of Street's original victims also voiced anger at the decision to free Street.

Speaking to a newspaper in 2003, Judith Chambers, who survived being struck by two bullets, warned that Street may one day attempt to repeat his slaughter.

Referring to her attacker by his original surname, she told the Sunday Mercury: 'One of my fears is that one day he will decide to come back to Birmingham and finish the job off. If he ever got his hands on another gun, I dread to think what the consequences might be.

'Some day, someone will be sorry that Williams was let out.' 

It was only after Street's arrest on October 14 last year that police discovered his real identity was mass killer Barry Williams.

Prosecutor Michael Duck QC told Birmingham Crown Court officers found six guns and an explosive device in a cupboard at the pensioner's home.

The serial killer adapted blank firing weapons and built homemade bullets before testing his fguns by firing them at an Argos catalogue from close range.

Mr Duck said: 'Officers searched the premises at Hazelville Road and the results of that search were in the context of this case, revealing and frightening.

'The methodology mirrored what he did in 1978. Of course, having discovered those items, there was further investigation into Harry Street and the reality of him having been Barry Williams in 1978 then emerged.'

Sentencing Street to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act, Mr Justice Blair said: 'The effect of these orders is that the defendant may never be released.'

The judge added that the risk of a further tragedy had only been 'narrowly avoided' and a serious case review is due to be released in January. 

A spokesperson for Ashworth Hospital said: 'A patient in our long term care was taken to general hospital after becoming acutely physically unwell. He did die.' 

He attacked the family on Andrew Road, the Bustleholm estate (pictured) and then drove to a petrol station and killed an elderly couple 

In 2007 Street became obsessed with his neighbours the Smiths, pictured is Warren Smith  arriving at Birmingham Crown Court with his daughter Shaneze
