The widow of U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy has broken her silence and is the focus of her daughter Rory's new documentary film, the Sundance premiere 'Ethel', which premiered at Sundance

Though initially reluctant when her daughter proposed the documentary, Ethel Kennedy opens up on screen with candid recollections about the family, including falling in love at first sight with her future husband on a ski trip to Canada.

'He was standing in front of an open fireplace,' she said in an interview alongside her daughter. 'I walked in the door and turned and saw him, and I thought, "whoa".'

In the film, Ethel Kennedy discusses campaigning for her husband and his brother, President John F. Kennedy, the similarities and differences between her family and the Kennedy clan, and raising 11 children after her husband's assassination in 1968.

At the time, she was pregnant with Rory, her youngest child, who was born six months after her father's death.

As a widow with such a big family, Ethel Kennedy said she coped simply by going about what she needed to do in tending her children.

'After Rory was born, it was — life just happened to take care of daily living, which almost had practically nothing to do with me,' she said.

'I just started taking carpools in the morning, and by the time I was finished dropping the last child off, I'd pick up the first one. And then, you know, I'm putting on all the galoshes. Well, you get the idea.'

In 'Ethel,' airing later this year on HBO, Rory Kennedy coaxes sweet, sad and funny anecdotes out of her mother and her siblings.

The Kennedys recollect their mother's devotion to steeping the children in world affairs, her mischievous sense of humor and her rebellious streak that led to run-ins with the law, such as the time she was charged with rustling horses after freeing some mistreated animals.

Through photos and home movies, the film offers an intimate look at the life of the Kennedys, the family relating how Robert Kennedy and his children slid down a bannister in the White House after his brother was elected and how the president once cautioned his fun-loving sister-in-law not to push his Cabinet members into the swimming pool anymore.

In front of her daughter's camera, Ethel Kennedy is unable to discuss the grief over her husband's death.

'When we lost Daddy ...' she begins, then tears up and tells her daughter, 'Talk about something else.'

‘Ethel’ does not touch on the other family tragedies that befell Mrs Kennedy after her husband’s death.

Her son David died of a drug overdose in 1984 and another son Michael was killed in a skiing accident in 1997.

Rory Kennedy, whose past Sundance documentaries include the Emmy-winning 'Ghosts of Abu Ghraib,' said 'Ethel' probably was her most challenging film because it was so personal.

'I know my mother and she is just terrific, and I have such admiration and respect for her. She's such a character, too. I really think she's one of the great untold stories, not just because of all of the events she's lived through,' Rory Kennedy said.

'But also because she's just such a wonderful person, and I hope that comes across in the film. She's so funny, and she is such an inspiration to me. Our family knows my mother, our close friends know her, but to be able to share her with so many other people I think was important.'

Ethel has gone to Sundance before to support her daughter's documentaries, but never as a the subject and star. Robert Redford and son Robert Kennedy Jr were both at her red carpet premiere last weekend

The film also reveals Robert Kennedy 
feared his children would be blinded by the mafia in an acid attack as 
revenge attack for investigating them.

Ethel Kennedy said that her late husband was anxious they would be targeted as retaliation for his probe into mafia racketeering.

He saw a report about an American journalist who had been blinded in an acid attack by the mob and feared they would do the same to him.

The disclosure could add to conspiracy theories that the mafia may have been responsible for Kennedy’s death.

He
 was shot dead by Sirhan Sirhan in 1968 but speculation has raged that 
his crusade against the mob whilst serving as U.S. Attorney General may 
have be the root of his demise.

Mrs
 Kennedy, 83, said that her last husband was scared after New York Post 
journalist Victor Riesel was blinded in an acid attack because of 
articles he had written about the mob.

‘We were told they were going to do the same with our children,’ she said.

Her eldest daughter Kathleen, one of several family members interviewed for the film, added: ‘We couldn’t leave school with the other kids at the end of the day.

‘We had to wait in the principal’s office to be picked up.’

The conspiracy theories relating to the 
mob and the Kennedy family usually involve New Orleans mafia don Carlos 
Marcello, who was deported to Guatemala by Mr Kennedy in 1961 after he 
was appointed Attorney General by his brother John.

Afterwards Marcello is said to have threatened John F Kennedy with the traditional Sicilian curse ‘Take the stone from my shoe’.

And when the President died, Marcello associate Jimmy Hoffa is supposed to have said: ‘This means Bobby is out as Attorney General.’

She also reveals that it was very hard 
for her husband to seek office for the first time and that he had to 
‘struggle for everything’ before becoming a senator in New York in 1964.

There is also colour about her own 
life including how she held wild parties which President Kennedy asked 
her to tone down, and that she was once charged with horse theft after 
she rescued a neighbour’s malnourished stallions.

The Kennedy family were back in the 
spotlight last week after John F. Kennedy Jr’s former assistant revealed
 her deep regret for convincing his wife to board the doomed flight 
which crashed and killed them both.

In
 her memoir RoseMarie Terenzio said she ‘should have kept her mouth 
shut’ rather than speak to Carolyn Bessette on July 16, 1999.

Carolyn
 had reportedly been going through problems with her husband but Ms 
Ternzio helped patch things up and persuaded her to travel with him to a
 wedding in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
