Interior decorator: Rebecca Adlington has decked her Olympic room out in Team GB paperchains

She's moved into her tiny Olympic Village bedroom and is getting used to her miniature bed, reportedly only 5ft 8in long.

So UK swimming hope Rebecca Adlington, 5ft 10in, is doing everything she can to make her digs feel like home, even hanging Team GB paper-chains all over her walls.

And the world record-breaking 23-year-old, who won two 
gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing in the 400m and 800m 
freestyle, has posted photographs of her newly decorated room on Twitter.

The post follows earlier photographs the swimmer tweeted of her room in the Olympic Village in Stratford, east London, which she moved into with the rest of her teammates on Monday.

Of course, when you're front-crawling through the water with all your strength, attempting to snare the Olympic gold medal for Team GB, what you really need behind you is a good night's sleep.

So spare a thought for Adlington who moved in to her new digs to discover the 2012 standard issue bed is, reportedly, two whole inches shorter than her 5ft 10in frame.

The freestyle swimmer posted pictures of her bedroom on Twitter, to which followers have queried how she is planning on getting an Olympic night's sleep in a bed so small.

The 23-year-old from Mansfield, 
Nottinghamshire, posted photographs on the social networking site 
alongside the tweets, 'My bed for the next month!! :-)', and 'Only been 
here a few hours and my room is a mess!!!'.

Twitter
users quickly reacted, with ‚Äè@jez_clarke asking 'How the hell will Bolt
fit into his bed.. Hopefully he has a special one made!', and @NicolaLH
cautioning 'it's a bit small! Don't roll over & fall out x'.

Another tweet came from @M422a_Lover,
who said: 'You don't even get a double bed? Austerity games right 
enough! Do you have to share a shower and toilet too?? Good Luck.:0'

And, referring to Adlington's sport, @ellwoodblues offered support, tweeting: 'hi there. Good luck all the way. Thought they would have given you water beds tho lol.'

Adlington also tweeted photographs of her with her apartment room mates - fellow Team GB swimmers Keri-anne Payne, Sophie Allen and Stacey Tadd.

It is rumoured that the beds in the
Olympic Village apartments are only 5'8'' long, a considerable length 
shorter than the long bodies of most of the athletes - especially the men.

Although the beds can be extended, perhaps the only athlete on the 
British team who will wake up well-rested in the standard bed is tiny 15-year-old gymnast 
Rebecca Tunney - nicknamed Twiggy - who, at 4ft 9in tall, is both the youngest and shortest 
member.

The London 2012 has been contacted to confirm the exact size of the beds but has yet to respond.

Saucy swimmers: Rebecca Adlington has been sharing her beloved books with Team GB

If you've ever wondered how the 
British female swimming team winds down in between training and 
competing, it's not with cups of tea and episodes of Desperate 
Housewives.

Double gold 
medal winner Rebecca Adlington has admitted she is 'addicted' to EL 
James' racy 'mummy-porn' trilogy Fifty Shades Of Grey, a trio of books 
about a young female graduate who enters a relationship with a 
billionaire businessman.

Responding
to a Twitter query from Australian swimmer Stephanie Rice about whether
or not the books were worth reading, the 23-year-old freestyle athlete 
tweeted: 'I loved them! I've read all 3. Was so addicted! Xx'

Adlington
then revealed she has now loaned two of the books to British swimmer 
Joanne Jackson who might have brought them to the games.

Jackson
replied that she has indeed brought them to Stratford, joining the 
conversation with the tweet: 'yeah am bringing them both. It won't take 
me long to read em, there [sic] quite addictive!'

So
if you see any of the British water babes blushing by the side of the 
pool after competing in one of their events, it might not only be the 
swimming race that has left them a little flushed....
