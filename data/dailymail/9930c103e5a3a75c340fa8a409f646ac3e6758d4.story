Country singer Mindy McCready is in Nashville and says she will probably not be able to bring her five-year-old son back to Florida to fulfil a judge's order - because she is nearly seven months pregnant with twins.

McCready said today that she and her mother have had a long custody battle over Zander. Her mother was awarded guardianship of the boy in 2007.

Florida Department of Children and Families said a missing person report was filed with Cape Coral police on Tuesday night after McCready took Zander from her father's home.

A statement released today from the troubled star's publicist revealed the pair are 'safe, healthy and comfortable'.

'The 5-year-old boy has been with his 
mother for more than 30 days,' the statement continued. 'Law enforcement
officials spoke with the child and saw Zander via Skype yesterday.'

On Tuesday, DCF discovered that 
McCready and the boy were not at her father's home and a judge ruled she
must return the boy voluntarily by 5pm. Thursday or risk an arrest 
warrant.

McCready earlier denied 'stealing' her
child and issued a statement saying: 'I am working with lawyers to try 
to get all this straightened out.' 

Mindy lost custody of Zander, seen here in 2009, left, and in the arms of Rosie
O'Donnell in 2006 at three months old, after several run-ins with the law

She told Access Hollywood: 'I did not 
steal my child, as it would be impossible for me to kidnap what already 
belongs to me! There never was any missing persons report and never an 
Amber Alert.'

The 36-year-old, who has been jailed twice and reportedly attempted suicide four times, does not have custody of the toddler.

A Florida judge has now given McCready until Thursday to return the boy.

The singer, who appeared on Celebrity 
Rehab with Dr Drew in season three, went missing after an allowed visit 
with her son at her father's home.

McCready's mother was granted custody of Zander after McCready's long line of run-ins with the law.

DCF
spokesman Terry Field said the agency requested an emergency pickup order, and a judge said McCready must 
return the boy by 5pm Thursday.

A former country music chart topper, 
McCready's life spiralled out of control in 2004, and has since suffered 
domestic abuse, been arrested on drug and DUI charges and made several 
reported attempts at suicide.

MCready's
first run-in with the law came in early 2004, when she attempted to buy
powerful pain killer Oxycotin using a fake prescription in Nashville, 
Tennessee.

McNight was arrested after he tried to choke her in 2005

After pleading 
guilty, she was later fined $4,000, ordered to perform 200 hours of 
community service, and slapped with a three year suspended sentence.

In May 2005, McCready's ex-boyfriend 
and the father of her child Zander, Billy McKnight, was arrested and 
charged with attempted murder after hitting and trying to strangle the singer.

Shortly after splitting with McKnight, she later attempted suicide the following July.

Adding to her woes, a warrant was issued for McCready, after she had violated her probation.

It
stemmed from two separate incidents in both May and July 2005, where she was charged
with driving on a suspended license, identity theft, unlawful use of 
transportation, unlawful imprisonment, and hindering prosecution.

She was later arrested in Florida and 
returned to Tennessee, where she went in front of a jury who once again 
charged her for violating her probation.

The former star, who was pregnant with 
McKnight's baby, later allegedly tried to commit suicide again in September 2005.

Following Zander's arrival in March 2006, it appeared that McCready was on the road to recovery.

However
after a reported physical argument with her mother in July 2007, she was 
arrested and charged with assault and resisting arrest.

McCready was later sentence to one year in jail, but was released just three months later in December.

After nearly half a year trouble free, McCready once again violated her probation.

Reality show: In 2009, McCready took part in reality TV
show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, which was aired the following year
in January and February

Sentenced to jail for the second time, she served 30 days of a 60 day sentence, and was released on good behaviour in October 2008.

Just under two months later in December, she reportedly attempted suicide for the third time.

In 2009, McCready took part in reality TV show  Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, which was aired the following year in January and February.

The 53-year-old addiction specialist treated the singer for substance abuse and she later appeared on The View to discuss her road to recovery and her attempt to salvage her music career.

Speaking out: McCready appeared on The Dr. Oz show on U.S television last year, to discuss her troubles

McCready later released her fifth studio album, I'm Still Here, in March 2010.

However, shortly after, she allegedly had another overdose.

McCready's fall from grace came after her success in the country music industry.

In 1996, McCready's LP Ten Thousand Angels sold over two million records, going platinum twice.
