Coulter's mother, Randi Coulter, tried to save her daughter, but the dog also attacked her, WFMY-TV reported.

She was treated at hospital for injuries, but later released.

The family released the following statement: ‘Braelynn Rayne Coulter was a beautiful, lively three year old young lady. She was full of life. She was the light of her mama and gaga's life and the loss leaves a hole in our hearts.

‘She was smart and vivacious and absolutely loved Dora the Explorer. She enjoyed her time in nature and going to a park was the highlight of her day. She will be missed dearly! Heaven is a little prettier today with Braelynn there!’

Friends of the family have set up a Go Fund Me page to help with Braelynn's funeral expenses

The dog, a male, was transported to the Guilford County Animal Shelter. He will likely be euthanized within the next few weeks, after police complete their investigation.

A family spokesperson said the dog has never been aggressive before and was a loving family pet, but neighbors said they had witnessed it attack other dogs and didn’t allow their child out to play if the dog was outside.
