Sheffield United midfielder Jose Baxter believes life in the Barclays Premier is too nice.

Baxter and his team-mates will face Tottenham in a Capital One Cup quarter-final first leg at White Hart Lane on Wednesday, ready to add another Premier League team to a growing list of scalps for Nigel Clough's League One team.

And the former Everton youngster hopes to remind Spurs that not every footballer in the country is out to make friends.

Baxter said: 'You look at the Premier League and it's all nice football.

'They don't really touch each other and it's not like that in our league.

'The Premier League is an unbelievable league, probably the best in the world but then teams aren't used to getting barged about, people in the faces, kicking them and not helping them up when they get kicked. It works for us.

'There's a lot of matey matey stuff in the Premier League.

'I've got a couple of mates in football but I don't like it at all - hugging and kissing each other before games and all that.

'My best mate, James Wallace, is in the same team as me now but if I was playing against him, I wouldn't speak to him until the game's finished.

'It's all gone a bit crazy in the Premier League but that's probably why they are where they are.

'They're nice, they don't want to get kicked and they're all great, technical players.

'It's just when they come to play us and we give them a few kicks, they don't like it.'

Clough has already guided Sheffield United past Southampton in the Capital One Cup and QPR in the FA Cup. 

Last season they beat Aston Villa and Fulham in the FA Cup before losing 5-3 to Hull at Wembley in the last four.

Baxter added: 'Once you beat the big teams your confidence grows.

'The more big teams that come to Bramall Lane or we go to them, they will be wary because we have knocked a few big teams out.

'We have stated it a little bit that we are a good cup team. We just need to put it right in the league.

'If you think you just have to turn up to beat a League One team, then you've got another thing coming.

'We've obviously got respect for them, but we'll go out there to boss them about and to things to them that Premier League teams don't do and it's worked.

'Our run increases our belief that we can beat anyone in the cups and we showed that last season too.

'Look at Southampton, they've beaten everyone in the league and are high-flying in the Premier League, so for them to come here and for us to beat them, shows we can really beat anyone.'
