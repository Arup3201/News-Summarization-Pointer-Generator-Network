This week's edition of Saturday Night Live fulfilled a long-held dream for one New York native - host Lady Gaga.

Before Gaga's opening number, though, SNL managed to lampoon both embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford and 60 Minutes reporter Lara Logan, both of whom have been in the news this week for all the wrong reasons.

Bobby Moynihan's Ford holds even more disastrous press conferences than the ones the real Ford held last week in which he made reference to having oral sex with his wife and smoking crack.

Taran Killam playing a Canadian TV host points out to Ford that people were becoming dubious of his apologies and denials.

'Then I’m going to go on a show where people do believe me and will believe anything I say,' says Moynihan's Ford.

The Canadian TV host asked what show would possibly believe the mayor after his previous lies and transgressions.

Cut to Ford being interviewed on 60 Minutes by Lara Logan, who this week has issued a series of apologies for her report on the 2012 Benghazi attack.

Vamp: Lady Gaga opened the show with a song and dance number

Logan, played by Kate McKinnon, introduces Ford as a 'Patriot, hero, role model,' before addressing Ford's numerous indiscretions.

Logan asks Ford if he's ever done crack, smoked marijuana or drunk alcohol, all of which he denies.

'So Mayor Ford, once and for all, what is the truth?' asks Logan.

'I have never done crack,' responds Ford.

'I believe you.'

'I’ve also never smoked pot.'

'I believe you.'

'And I’ve never had alcohol.'

She believes him unreservedly.

'Oh, my God. This is the best show,' says Ford.

Lady Gaga opened the show, playing up her New York roots to get the audience onside then admitting to loving getting 'cheap applause.'

She launched into a rendition of her hit Applause which then segues into an all-out Broadway-inspired 'New York, New York.'

The hitmaker, who told fans earlier this week she's been wanting to host Saturday Night Live since she was 'four and three-quarters,' appeared in her first skit as a nerdy Apple Genius employee who is a guest on the imagined Kim Kardashian and Kanye West morning show, Waking up with Kimye.

She pulled off a believable impression of Marisa Tomei's character Mona Lisa Vito in My Cousin Vinny in a skit about an eccentric co-op board, an overzealous stage mother, and child actor.

Gaga also addressed critics who said her hit song Born this Way was a rip-off of Madonna's Express Yourself.

A vogue-ing, pointy-bra-clad Gaga sang her song Born this Way as part of a skit about bad cover songs.

In a sketch called Upper West Side 2063, Gaga played an elderly, long-forgotten version of herself, who calls on a handy man just so she can tell him stories about herself.

At the end, she sat down at her piano and slowly sings the lyrics to one of her latest songs.

'I live for the applause, applause, applause,' she sings, presses a button on a machine that makes two tiny hands clap together.

The hitmaker also performed two songs during the show, including her collaboration with R. Kelly, Do What U Want With My Body.
