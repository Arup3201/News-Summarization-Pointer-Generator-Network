The Pakistani Taliban have voted to promote number their number two commander to replace leader killed by American drone yesterday.

Khan Said, known as Sajna, will replace leader Hakimullah Mehsud who was killed along with three others in a strike by a U.S. drone, militant commanders and security sources have confirmed.

Said is believed to have masterminded an attack on a jail in northwest Pakistan that freed nearly 400 prisoners in 2012 and an attack on a Pakistani air force base in the same year.

Pakistani Taliban fighters secretly buried their leader early this morning and moved quickly to replace him while vowing a wave of suicide bombs in revenge.

At the same time the Pakistani government has denounced Mehsud's killing as a U.S bid to derail planned peace talks.

Despite his reputation as an uncompromising militant leader their had been hopes that the two sides could reach an agreement in as the talks got underway.

Information Minister Pervez Rashid told the press that Pakistan would not allow American intervention to distract them, he said: 'The
 U.S. has tried to attack the peace talks with this drone but we will 
not let them fail.'

Some angry politicians even demanded that U.S. military supply lines into Afghanistan be blocked in response.

Bounty: Mehsud has been among the CIA's most wanted men in the world for at least four years with and offer of $5million for information

Shah Farman, a spokesman for the 
government of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said 
provincial legislators would pass a resolution on Monday to cut NATO 
supply lines into landlocked Afghanistan.

The supply
 lines Pakistan have been crucial since the 
Afghan war began in 2001 and remain vital as the United States and other
 Western forces prepare to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of next 
year.

Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head, and three others were killed on Friday in the militant stronghold of Miranshah in northwest Pakistan, Pakistani security officials said.

His vehicle was hit after he attended a meeting of Taliban leaders, a Pakistani Taliban fighter said, adding Mehsud's body was 'damaged but recognisable'. His bodyguard and driver were also killed.

He was secretly buried under cover of darkness in the early hours by a few companions amid fears that his funeral might be attacked by U.S. drones.

Azam Tariq, a Pakistani Taliban spokesman said the killing of the group's leader would lead to revenge attacks.

He said: 'Every drop of Hakimullah's blood will turn into a suicide bomber.

'America and their friends shouldn't be happy because we will take revenge for our martyr's blood.'

Mehsud took over as leader of the al Qaeda-linked Pakistani Taliban in 2009. The group's two previous leaders were also killed in attacks by U.S. missile-firing drones.

But the swift moves to replace Mehsud some Taliban commanders were reportedly unhappy with the choice and wanted more talks.

The differing views point to divisions within the Pakistani Taliban, an umbrella group of factions allied with the Afghan Taliban and battling the Pakistani state in the hope of imposing Islamist rule.

They have killed thousands of Pakistani civilians and numerous members of the security forces and in September claimed to have been behind the killing of an army general.

In Washington, two U.S. officials also confirmed that CIA drone strike had been responsible for Mehsud's death.

In 2010, Mehsud appeared in a farewell video with a Jordanian suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees at a base in Afghanistan.

Mehsud was then in his mid-30s and had a sharp face framed by a beard and a tangle of long hair, usually flowing from beneath a traditional Afghan hat.

In May, Mehsud's deputy was killed by drone nearby. Last month, one of his top deputies was captured in Afghanistan.
