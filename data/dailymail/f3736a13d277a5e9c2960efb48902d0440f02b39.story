A toddler died from horrific injuries similar to those seen in car accidents after her mother’s teenage boyfriend kicked her across a room.

Two-year-old Amina Agboola was left in the care of Dean Harris, 19, while her mother took an older sibling to school.

When the toddler wet herself, Harris kicked her so hard she landed six feet away and was left with a split liver.

He dialled 999, claiming the little 
girl had fallen off the toilet and hit her head. But tests later 
revealed she had numerous other injuries including a fractured arm, 
bruises to her face and bite marks on her cheeks and forearm.

Harris, now 20, showed no emotion 
yesterday as he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years 
after being found guilty of murder.

Judge Mark Lucraft QC told him: ‘The injury inflicted on Amina was similar to the force of a road traffic accident.

‘Her liver was forcibly split into two pieces and a piece of her liver went into her bloodstream.

‘The bruises on her body were all 
recent and it was very likely they were inflicted at the same time as 
that fatal injury. You are a dangerous young man.’

Amina’s mother Sarah Racqueman, 29, 
was given a suspended 11-month sentence this week after admitting two 
counts of cruelty to children, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

She was cleared of causing or allowing Amina’s death.

In an impact statement read by the 
judge, the toddler’s father, Reuben Agboola, said: ‘Every time a picture
 of Amina’s face comes up I cry. It has left a void in my heart. The 
pain will never go away.’

Paramedics who treated Amina at her 
home in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on November 21 last year, said they 
found her looking like a ‘rag doll’ in a pink nightie, struggling to 
breathe. She later died in hospital.

While on remand, Harris confessed to a fellow inmate he had lashed out because Amina had wet herself.

During his trial at Cambridge Crown 
Court, he said: ‘I did not intend to kick her. It just happened in a 
split second because I was frustrated.’

Amina was found to have had a number of other injuries, including an untreated broken wrist

Racqueman and Harris, who were both unemployed, began a relationship five months before Amina’s death.

Social services warned Racqueman that Harris was capable of violence and was a drug user.

She claimed she had not usually 
allowed Harris to look after her daughter, but was ‘not in her right 
mind’ the day Amina was killed.  Harris admitted manslaughter, but was 
convicted of murder by a jury last month.

Police released a confession he wrote 
to Amina’s family, in which he said: ‘At this point all I can remember 
saying is “For ***** sake Mina”.

‘I was already in a standing position 
and the next thing I knew I had kicked her in the stomach. She had gone 
backwards and landed on her front about six feet away.’

Dean Harris wrote a confession letter to Amina Agboola's family confessing that he killed her.

The letter, parts of which have been released by Cambridgeshire Police, describe the moment he killed Amina.

In the note Harris then apologises to her family - saying 'only wish I could take all this back.'

It reads: 'At this point I can remember saying 'for -- sake Mina', I was already in a standing position and the next thing I knew I had kicked her in the stomach.

'She had gone backwards and landed on her front about six feet away. I realised what I had done and went to pick her up.

'She was crying at this point and I could tell it had winded her because of the way she was talking.

'I picked her up to comfort her, I checked her stomach to see if she was OK. I held her in my arms for around three minutes until she stopped crying.

'When I went to put her down on the floor to further see if she was OK I noticed that she had become limp....I then panicked.

'...crying.'When I went to put her down on the floor to further see if she was OK I noticed that she had become limp.'

In his confession Harris says that he hope the family can find some closure 

'Everything else that happened after this point, the phone calls, the ambulance, is well documented.

'I only wish I could take all this back but I can't so I hope the family can find some closure.

'I would further like to add that none of this was Sarah's fault, she has lost a child, so I think she has suffered enough.

'I am truly sorry for what I have done. I can no longer cause further anguish by continuing to lie.'
