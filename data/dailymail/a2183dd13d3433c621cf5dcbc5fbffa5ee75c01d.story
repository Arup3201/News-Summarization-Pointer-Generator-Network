Far-right groups in Britain could see a resurgence in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, campaigners have warned.

Anti-fascists are worried about the rise of potentially dangerous teenage neo-Nazis.

A collapse in support for the British National Party and English Defence League had been seen as part of a decline in Far-Right extremism.

At war: Paul Pitt, leader of the South East Alliance, says Britain is at war with radical Islam

But a report by campaign group Hope Not Hate said authorities must remain vigilant for ‘lone wolf’ attacks by single fanatics.

Although Far-Right groups have so far failed to capitalise on the emergence of Islamic State, it said, ‘as we have seen with events in France in recent days, the situation can change very fast’. It also warned of growing anti-Semitism.

The group, which has monitored the Far-Right for a decade, said it had detected several disturbing signs of revival and warned that the openly racist neo-Nazi group National Action is attracting young recruits.

The report, by Hope Not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles and researcher Matthew Collins, said: ‘This is probably the most ideological Nazi group to emerge in Britain for decades.’

In October Garron Helm, a 21-year-old National Action supporter, was jailed for sending anti-Semitic tweets to Labour MP Luciana Berger.

‘This appears to have upped the ante, the attention bringing a new lot of admirers and wannabes from the rest of the Far-Right,’ the report found. It noted that the monitoring group Community Security Trust reported a record 302 anti-Semitic incidents last July during the Gaza conflict.

But the most prominent Far-Right groups – the BNP and EDL – have struggled with internal splits and the rise of Ukip, the report found.

The BNP, which had 58 councillors and two MEPs, has suffered since leader Nick Griffin was ousted and now has only two councillors.

Ukip has ‘steamrollered through their previous heartlands and stolen their voters,’ the report said.

It noted that Ukip is not Far-Right and has a ban on ex BNP members, but added: ‘While Ukip is not the BNP and Farage is not Griffin, it is clear that most former BNP voters feel quite at home in the Ukip stable.’

The EDL, which organised a series of high-profile protests against ‘Islamisation’, has also fragmented since the group’s charismatic leader Stephen Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, quit in late 2013 citing his concerns over the ‘dangers of Far-Right extremism’.

The report suggested he could make a comeback, adding: ‘He is the one person currently around who could transform the fortunes of Britain’s Far-Right and anti-Islam groups.

‘We are aware that many people are actively encouraging him to return and we feel there is a real possibility that he will.’

Angry: The reasons for joining the Far Right are complex and cover a huge range of issues

Fear: Many join out of fear of immigration, although Roberts says each member has their own line in the sand

However, it found that none of the groups has been ‘able to capitalise’ on issues such as the rise of Islamic State and the Rotherham grooming scandal, with demonstrations still ‘relatively poorly attended’.

Mr Lowles said: ‘Our report reveals that, despite otherwise favourable conditions, Far-Right hate networks are really struggling at the moment.

‘For that we should all be thankful, though of course we must not rest on our laurels.’

The report came as a film screened on Channel 4 last night documented the rise of some of Britain’s new sinister Far-Right organisations.

Paul Prodromou, a former EDL member and the founder of the South East Alliance, told the programme he believes Britain is at war.

‘I don’t think moderate Muslims exist. The jihadis are killing in the name of Islam,’ Mr Prodromou, who publicly uses the surname Pitt, told the documentary.

‘They’re not doing it in anyone else’s name. If you are Muslim, you are part of Islam. They have no reason to be in this country whatsoever. They are vermin.’

Another Far-Right supporter told the filmmakers: ‘This is the grim reality of England 2015. A country tearing itself apart.

‘I’d be happy breaking their bones . . . I’d be happy hurting them.’ 

A white supremacist group, the 18 in the name is derived from Adolf Hitler - A and H being the first and eighth letters in the alphabet.

Based on the principle of 'leaderless resistance', the group has been connected with a series of murders as well as violent demonstrations.

During the 1980s, Combat 18 was linked with the Loyalist movement in Northern Ireland, while in the rest of the UK, it joined forces with football hooligans.

Today, it still exists on the fringes of the Far Right, although many in the movement have disavowed it.

The group also has imitators in the shape of international ultra-nationalist movements, most notably Greece's Golden Dawn.
