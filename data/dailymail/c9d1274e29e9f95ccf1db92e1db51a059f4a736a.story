The Indian doctor responsible for the mass-sterilisation which left 13 women dead and dozens hospitalised, used rusty instruments to perform the operations.

R.K. Gupta, is accused of having carried out  83 tubectomies in just three hours at a state-run 'family planning camp' in the Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh state on Saturday.

A majority of the women fell ill shortly afterwards, and local government officials admit the equipment used was rusty and medicines provided to the women were contaminated.

Tragedy: 13 women have died and dozens remain in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in India, which was carried out with rusty instruments and contaminated medicines

'Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery,' said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district where the camp was held. 

The death toll has now reached 13, dozens  remain in hospital and 20 are critically ill.

The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines.

Dr Gupta's mass sterilisation took less than three hours with the help of two assistants working in a dirty, abandoned private hospital, officials said, and contravened government guidelines to limit such operations to 30 a day.  

'Preliminary reports show that the medicines administered were spurious and also the equipment used was rusted,' senior local government official Siddharth Komal Singh Pardeshi said.

A seven-member team of doctors from New Delhi arrived in the district of Bilaspur on Wednesday to investigate what went wrong, and the local government registered with the police a case of causing death by negligence against Gupta.

Local media said Gupta blamed medicine the women had been later given and denied making any mistakes.

The 83 women who underwent tubectomies at the camp received
incentive payments of 1,400 rupees ($23) to have the surgery,
according to R.K. Bhange, Bilaspur's chief medical officer.
Health workers also got 200 ($3.25) rupees for bringing a woman
to the camp.

The cause of the deaths of the eight women had not been
determined, according to Bhange, but he said they had been
vomiting before they died.

Senior state health officials have been sent to investigate.

'As of now, the government has not found any evidence of
negligence,' said Bhange. He said the government doctors who had
performed the surgeries were experienced in the procedure.

Deaths due to sterilization are not a new problem in India,
where more than four million sterilizations were performed in
2013-14, according to the government.

Between 2009 and 2012, the government paid compensation for
568 deaths resulting from sterilization, the health ministry
said in an answer to a question in parliament two years ago.

Relatives mourn the death of women who died after undergoing sterilization surgeries. Local media reports that all the women involved had been operated on within a five hour window

 

Authorities in eastern India came under fire last year after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation.

The women had all undergone surgical procedures at a hospital that local officials said was not equipped to accommodate such a large number of patients.

Health advocates worry that paying women to undergo
sterilization at family planning camps is both dangerous and, by
default, limits their contraceptive choices.

'The payment is a form of coercion, especially when you are
dealing with marginalized communities,' said Kerry McBroom,
director of the Reproductive Rights Initiative at the Human
Rights Law Network in New Delhi.

She said basic care at the camps is often inadequate, with
surgeries rushed through in unhygienic conditions.

Pratap Singh, commissioner of Chhattisgarh's Department of
Health and Family Welfare, said  the state's
sterilization program was entirely voluntary.

The United Nations expressed concern.

'If the facts are confirmed, then a grave human tragedy has
occurred,' said Kate Gilmore, deputy executive director of the
U.N. Population Fund.

'Where there is deviation from clinical standards, there
must be consequences.'
