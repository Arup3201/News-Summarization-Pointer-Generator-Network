The body of Laurence Mullany-Mills, six, was found just before 4am yesterday by Lincolnshire Police underwater search unit officers

This is the first picture of Laurence Mullany-Mills, six, who drowned in a freezing lake along with his grandmother during an outing to feed the ducks.

The alarm was raised when Dawn Mullany, 71, and Laurence failed to return to his home on Thursday night.

Police began a major search operation helped by friends and neighbours. An RAF helicopter was deployed.

They had found Mrs Mullany’s house empty and then discovered her car near the duck pond in the hamlet of  Holywell, Lincolnshire.

She was found in the water soon afterwards and, despite efforts to resuscitate the pensioner, she was certified dead at the scene.

Teams searched through the night for the missing boy, hoping he would be found alive.

Tragically, his body was found just before 4am yesterday by Lincolnshire Police underwater search unit officers.

His parents, Asmina Mullany-Mills and Vaughan Mills, both 41, who also have a daughter Nancy, 15 months, were too upset to speak last night.

A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said the family was ‘in a terrible way’.

Neighbours described Laurence as ‘a lovely little boy’ from a ‘close, loving family’.

Carol Spall, 73, who lives next door, said: ‘He was always an adventurous little boy. Everyone he met fell in love with him.

‘We would see his little head peering over the garden wall, he always wanted to stop and have a chat.

‘He endeared himself to everyone. He was a lovely little boy. This is so horrendous, they were such a close, loving family.’

Laurence, known as Laurie, was a pupil at Ketton Church of England Primary School, she said.

‘He was such a cheeky little character,’ Miss Spall added. ‘I can’t imagine how they will cope without him. I was saying to Asmina not long ago what a credit her children were to her and her husband.

‘They are such good parents and such charming children. Laurie was a good big brother to Nancy, he was very caring.’

The family had recently returned from a holiday in New Zealand to spend Christmas with Mr Mills’s family.

Miss Spall’s partner Addison Wishalt, 73, added: ‘Laurie was very intelligent and articulate.

It is believed the pair fell into the freezing water earlier in the day while feeding the swans and ducks in the remote pond

‘He was very keen on rugby and he told us he wanted to learn to play the violin. The other day I saw little Laurie and his mum walking either side of Nancy helping her to walk to the shop. She’s just learning now and Laurie was keen to help teach her.’

The couple said Mrs Mullany was a ‘gracious lady’. Miss Spall added: ‘She was very kind and adored her grandchildren. She was very capable, you would trust her to look after anybody in the world.

‘For the family to lose her and  little Laurie is beyond a tragedy.’

The lake, which stretches the length of the hamlet, is frequented by dozen of swans and ducks.

It is surrounded by a grass verge and there is a concrete platform for feeding the birds.

Mrs Mullany was described by her neighbours as ‘a sweet, lovely lady’ who had lived in the village of Castle Bytham,  Lincolnshire, for around 30 years.

Last night, they told how she had suffered tragedy in her life, including the death of her father in  wartime action in 1943 when she was a baby.

In 1977, her husband, Firozali, died aged just 35.

A neighbour, who joined the search after police knocked on his door, said: ‘She was great with kids and loved them to bits.

'She was a fantastic neighbour and could not do enough to help us out.’

Muriel Cooke, Castle Bytham  Parish Council clerk, said: ‘She was a very nice lady, very cultured. It is shocking news for the village.’

Detective Chief Inspector David Wood said: ‘Both bodies were found near a grate over a sluice at one end of the pond.

‘This is a very tragic accident. There are no suspicious circumstances. There are no witnesses and we may never know exactly what happened.’

Laurence lived in Castle Bytham and the tragedy happened at a pond in the nearby village of Holywell
