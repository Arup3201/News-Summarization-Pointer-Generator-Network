Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a ‘sugar daddy’ lover he met when he was just 17.

The Strictly Come Dancing judge said the 43-year-old man paid for his dance lessons and helped kick-start his television career in return for ‘doing the dirty’.

Revel Horwood, known for his acerbic comments on the BBC1 show, said the nature of the relationship meant he had previously been described by some as a ‘rent boy’.

The dancer made the revelations last night at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he also disclosed he is to undergo hip surgery in two weeks’ time.

In a wide-ranging interview, he also discussed how celebrities found it uncomfortable to be ‘flung about by dancers’ on the popular show.

Discussing his relationship with the older man, Revel Horwood, 48, said he was approached while he was living in his native Australia as a teenager.

Describing him as ‘Mr X’ for legal reasons, Revel Horwood said: ‘It was this man who was 43 and I was 17.

‘He said I will pay for your classes but you come away with me and we do the dirty.

‘I suppose that could be compared to a lady getting engaged and getting a great big sparkling Tiffany ring – and then breaking off the engagement but keeping the ring.’

At the time, Revel Horwood had left school and was training as a chef, but said he ‘hated’ it, adding that Mr X ‘saved me from that’.

However, Revel Horwood did not divulge any further details of the relationship and quickly moved on to other subjects.

Talking about his imminent hip surgery, Revel Horwood said it would clash with filming for the current series.

He said: ‘I’m going in at six o’clock in the morning on Sunday after filming Saturday night live.

‘I will be watching myself on the telly 
on Sunday night [the results show screened on Sunday is filmed on 
Saturday night] with my old hip and I’ll have a new one in.’ He added: 
‘I will be made of titanium and I can’t wait, darling.’

Asked whether he would be fit to return to the show the following week, he said he might have to face the cameras and the audience in a wheelchair, adding: ‘A fabulous glittery one I hope.’

He also revealed how celebrities found it difficult being ‘manhandled’.

‘Sometimes you throw a girl up and she will fart and come back down,’ he joked.

In his latest book, Tales From the Dance Floor, Revel Horwood wrote about how fellow Strictly judge Darcey Bussell breaks wind on set.

Last night he said he had not warned her before the book was published – and the first thing she said to him when she saw him after reading it was, ‘Fart?’

But he added she had taken it well and spent the entire night’s filming leaning to one side and pretending to break wind. ‘We were in stitches,’ he said.
