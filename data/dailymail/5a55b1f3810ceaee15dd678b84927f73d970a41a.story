Throwing caution to the wind, rapper 2 Chainz has released a video of himself smoking the 'most expensivest' joint.

The 37-year-old father-of-two visited a smoke shop at an unspecified location and tried a cigarette made with 24K gold paper and cannabis costing $800 per ounce.

After taking a puff, he described the fancy roll as being 'like the caviar of joints' and one experience that he would 'never forget'.

However, he was less impressed with the amount of marijuana he found in one of the $100 eighth-ounce tins, stating: 'This s*** is like them Lays potato chips. You open [them up] and there's only four on the inside!'

Thumbs up: 'This is like the caviar of joints . . . This is one experience that I will never forget,' the music star chimes as he tries the fancy roll

Footage shows the store owner pre-warning 2 Chainz that the gold rolling paper has a 'distinctive taste' but it's completely safe to digest.

It came from Shine, a company born out of a boys' trip to Las Vegas, which specializes in gold-coated smoking implements.

2 Chainz decided to sort out a pricey fix as part of his web series for GQ Magazine, called Most Expensivest S****. During his expedition he also used a blow torch to fire up a larger-than-life bong.

In previous episodes he's sipped on diamond-infused vodka and had a $25,000 panama hat made.

After trying his luxurious joint, he concluded: 'It was almost so fancy [I] didn't want to smoke it.'

The Georgia native is known for being a big advocate of marijuana. Over the years his passion for the substance has landed him on the wrong side of the law.

Most recently he argued with HLN's Nancy Grace about the drug's legalization.

During the TV debate he countered that the benefits of legalizing marijuana far outweigh the risks.

'If we got half of the states legalizing pot, if the rest of the community legalizes pot that frees up taxpayers' money,' 2 Chainz said.

'That'll allow us to do something with this extra, with these funds, from fixing potholes in the street to building stadiums. I'm down with that.'

For his recent luxury smoking experience, 2 Chainz teamed up with Dr. Dina.

The Los Angeles-based medical marijuana consultant  was also filmed taking a drag on the gold rollie.

She says that cannabis they smoked is so expensive because it is cut off the hemp plant and tinned on the spot. It is then dried and cured in the can.

To date the video of 2 Chainz smoking the 'most expensivest' joint has been watched more than 300,000 times with many viewers criticizing the singer's exploits.
