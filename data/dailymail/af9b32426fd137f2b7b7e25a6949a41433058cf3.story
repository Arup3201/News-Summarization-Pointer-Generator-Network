A 19-year-old aspiring model has posted graphic photos on social media of horrific injuries inflicted by her ex-boyfriend in a bid to help other victims of domestic violence.

The Illinois student, who goes by the name Mori Gabriella Montgomery, put the horrifying images on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to illustrate the abuse she received at the hands of her ex-boyfriend who she met through her best friend and dated for eight months

After an incident in February in which she was thrown from a moving car and then 'beaten and dragged' she was hospitalised and left needing a neck brace. 

Before and after: Mori Gabriella Montgomery, a 19-year-old aspiring model has posted graphic photos on social media of injuries inflicted on her by her ex-boyfriend in a bid to help other victims of domestic violence

She wrote about the abuse on her Twitter page and her story has now gone viral.

'This might be a little graphic but I just want to let everyone know that I am okay. I am a survivor of domestic violence with a boy I dated for 8 months,' she wrote.

'I really thought everything was fine but he constantly questioned me about cheating and flirting.

After she wrote about the abuse on her Twitter page her story went viral and she has now become an unofficial ambassador in the battle against domestic violence

'Nonsense. I never looked at someone 
the way he looked at me. Thought I loved this boy. How can someone that 
‘loves’ me do this to me? The scars on my chest are way worse and extend
 down to my right nipple, completely scarred.

'The skin on my shoulder has been completely skinned. And I have bruising on my rib cage, neck, and my muscles.

'I
 was kicked out of a moving vehicle, then beaten and dragged, as I 
blacked out and was left lying there in my own puddle of blood.

Ms Montgomery said she now has to wear a neck brace for up to a month, a cast on her arm and she has difficulty in walking.

She finished her message: 'I hope to be an inspiration to women and anyone involved in domestic violence.'

Ms
 Montgomery told news.com.au: 'He was always jealous and extra 
aggressive. We were playing around one day and he slapped me really 
hard.

'He apologised straight after so I didn’t think anything of it really, until this all happene.'

'I
 am recovering fairly well and instead of relying on people to help me 
eat, drink, walk, put clothes on, etc, I am slowly but surely learning 
to do these things on my own.'

Her mother wrote on Facebook:  'As horrible as she looks, we are blessed to still have her. She is no longer in the same state. She is safe & recovering. He was arrested, but bonded out a couple days later. I'm not posting these pics to ensue any hate on him. I will pray for him just as I ask you to pray for my baby. I am posting them to bring awareness to domestic violence.

'They looked like a happy couple. We must learn & teach our children self-control.'

One user wrote on Facebook: 'Unbelievable what that coward did. God will handle that clown. Glad she is safe now. Praying for you all.'

While another user wrote under a photo of the abuse: 'You are an inspiration to women everywhere with your courage threw this trial ... so you wear those scars as a Badge of Honor.'

On her Twitter page a follower tweeted :'Much love to you @bambiiii_ you're a brave girl! Hope recovery goes well & thank you for your bravery in sharing ur story.'
