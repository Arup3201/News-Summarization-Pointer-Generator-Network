Scotland Yard could lose its £31 million-a-year contract protecting MPs and peers to a ‘cheaper’ outside security firm.

The radical move would see traditional uniformed ‘bobbies’ inside the Palace of Westminster replaced by private staff from a company such as G4S.

The plans come as MPs fight to cut the Commons’ £200 million-plus annual budget and find ways of making money out of the historic building – including hiring it out as a film set.

However, that idea and the proposal to ‘privatise’ Westminster’s policing sparked a ferocious backlash from some MPs.

There were fears of a repeat of the security fiasco of the 2012 Olympics when G4S was unable to provide 10,400 security guards on time.

Officials in both the Commons and the Lords have embarked on cost-cutting programmes,  with the policing contract, traditionally provided by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), which runs out in 2015,  in the line of fire.

Last year, MPs heard complaints that although the Met had 500 personnel at Westminster, only 20 or 30 were visible at any one time.

Now official documents reveal that a review into the contract,  led by parliamentary security director Paul Martin, is exploring ‘all options’ – including ‘outsourcing’ some of the service currently provided by the Met.

A well-placed source said: ‘Many of the security staff in here are not fully-fledged bobbies anyway, even though they’re provided by the Met.  We could potentially save some money by letting a private company provide those.’

But senior Labour MP Barry Sheerman said: ‘After what happened at last year’s Olympics, it beggars belief we’re even considering letting a private firm look after the security of one of the most sensitive sites in the UK.’

Mr Sheerman, former chairman of the Commons education committee, also condemned the ‘over-commercialisation’ of the Palaces.

He said: ‘This is the historic Palace of Westminster where the nation’s laws are debated and made. It’s not some Disneyland theme park by the Thames.’

Last night, a Commons spokesman said: ‘No decisions are expected to be taken until next year.’
