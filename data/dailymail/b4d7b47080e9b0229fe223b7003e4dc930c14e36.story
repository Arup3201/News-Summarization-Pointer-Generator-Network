Facebook may be to blame for turning the word Like into a verb, but Google is set to take this a step further.

According to a new patent filed by the internet giant, Google wants its Glass wearers to like brands, products and locations simply by making a heart shape with their hands.

A camera on the headmounted device scans and recognises the item being liked and stores its details in a list of favourites, which can then be shared. 

A patent filed in the U.S. shows Google's plans to let its Glass users generate a like by creating a heart shape with their hands in front of real-life objects, pictured. The headmounted device would then scan the item to record that the wearer likes that particular brand, product or location

Google is putting the finishing touches to a smartwatch that could be unveiled 'within weeks', according to industry insiders.

The watch, believed to be codenamed Gem, could take advantage of the work Google has been doing on its Glass wearable computer.

It could also use the same Google Now alerts for directions and text messages as the eyewear.

The patent is called 'Hand gestures to signify what is important' and was made public on Wednesday.

In one diagram, hands shaped as a heart are shown in front of a painting, while another shows the hand gesture being used in front of building sign.

Google explains in the patent: 'Hand gestures can be used to provide user input to a wearable computing device, and in particular to identify, signify, or otherwise indicate what may be considered or classified as important or worthy of attention or notice.

'A wearable computing device, which could include a headmounted display (HMD) and a video camera, may recognise known hand gestures and carry out particular actions in response.

'Particular hand gestures could be used 
for selecting portions of a field of view of the HMD, and generating 
images from the selected portions.'

It is thought the technology could use, or build on, Google's existing Goggles app, demonstration image pictured,  that lets people take photos of items and find them online. This includes scanning products in shops, to compare online prices, for example, or landmarks to find a location on a map

This flow chart from Google's patent explains the process of how a head-mounted device could scan a hand gesture, recognise the object and save it online

In simple terms, a user would frame any real-world object with a heart-shaped hand gesture and a built-in camera would scan the frame and 'like' the highlighted product or location.

Google could also expand the type and number of hand gestures the technology recognises to include thumbs-up gestures, pointing, forming an L (for like) with a thumb and forefinger or circling items with a loop.

The 'wearable computing device' likely refers to Google's Glass technology, yet the patent's wording suggests it could be applied to any form of headmounted wearable technology.

It is also thought the technology could use, or build upon, Google's existing Goggles app that lets people take photos of items and find them online.

This includes scanning products in shops, to compare online prices, for example, or scanning landmarks to find a location on a map.
