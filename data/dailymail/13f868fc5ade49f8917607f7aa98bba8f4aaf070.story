A 73-year-old grandfather is on the run after shooting dead his daughter-in-law in a brutal attack.

Eugene Palmer, of Stony point, New York, confronted Tammy Palmer, 39, with his shotgun yesterday after she put her two children on the school bus and returned to her home, which is on the same block of land as his.

She was found dead with a bullet wound to her chest later that day.

According to The Journal News, the first shot of pellets struck her in the arm and she screamed and the second and third struck her in the right side of the chest, killing her.

The weapon used in the slaying was found in the yard of her Willow Grove Road home near her body.

Tammy Palmer's family said the Eugene Palmer had began a campaign of harassment against her after the 39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged husband, John.

The order preventing him from the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16.

She lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law.

'This morning she put the kids on the bus, I think she was hanging clothes,' said the victim’s father John Pannirello.

'He went there, I guess they had an argument. Went to get a gun, killed her.'

Eugene Palmer's sister, Elaine Babcock, said he rushed to her house straight after the slaying and admitted what he'd done.

'He just came in and said, 'Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough.

'I shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do,' and then he just took off,' Babcock told CBS.

The woman said she immediately called police, who believe he fled into Harriman State Park, which backs on to his property.

Search teams spent yesterday hunting the woods for the man, a retired park ranger, and were using tracking dogs and helicopters to help them. 

Today they discovered his vehicle, a 1995 green Dodge Ram pickup truck, shortly after 1pm, and remain confident he is somewhere in the park.

Tammy Palmer's parents are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their daughter, and are fighting to take custody of her two children.

They say her relationship with her father-in-law had grown increasingly ugly, culminating in a fight last week.

But they never thought the man would end her life.

'She told me 'Mommy, don’t worry I’ll be alright.' I don’t think she ever thought that this man would kill her,' Tammy's mother Violet Pannirello told CBS.

'She’s gone. She’s resting. She’s not scared anymore. It’s so sad,' Pannirello said, adding 'a part of me died today.'

Police said Palmer is likely to be dangerous, as he has a large collection of guns. Authorities said to call 911 if he is spotted.
