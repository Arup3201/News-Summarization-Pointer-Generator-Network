Swansea City have signed Tottenham’s Tom Carroll on loan for the remainder of the season.

The England Under 21 midfielder will be available for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League fixture against Burnley.

Swansea manager Garry Monk was keen to strengthen his midfield options with knee injuries currently keeping out the vastly influential Leon Briton, out for three-to-four weeks, as well as Jay Fulton.

The 22-year-old has made 23 appearances for Tottenham. He enjoyed his best spell under Andre Villas-Boas, where he featured 14 times in the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup.

Last season, Carroll featured in both legs of Spurs’ Europa League victories over Dinamo Tbilisi before joining Queens Park Rangers on loan, making 26 appearances as the London club won the Championship play-off final.

Swansea manager Garry Monk believes he has more quality to call on this season - but admits he does need extra bodies to bolster his squad.

Monk drafted in Gylfi Sigurdsson, Lukasz Fabianski, Bafetimbi Gomis, Jefferson Montero and Marvin Emnes over the summer and on Wednesday captured Argentina defender Federico Fernandez from Napoli for a fee understood to be around the £8million mark.

But Swansea were also depleted as Ben Davies and Michel Vorm left for Tottenham, loan signing Jonathan de Guzman headed for Napoli and the Spanish quartet of Michu, Pablo Hernandez, Chico Flores and Alejandro Pozuelo were among the other players who left.

'It is different to last season. We had 25-26 senior professionals last season and now I have five or six of the Under 21s in my squad,' Monk said ahead of newly-promoted Burnley's trip to the Liberty Stadium on Saturday.

'So in terms of that there is a big difference, but in terms of the players we can bring on, it is better.

'There were players we have got rid of from last season and the players we have brought in I believe are better players.

'That is how I feel, but in terms of numbers of senior professionals we do need two or three players.

'We are in a very tough league that gets better every year and you have to add quality every year and get a group that is good together.

'It has been a mammoth effort from everyone involved this summer to put these things in place on the budget we have, but at this moment we have worked it well.'

Monk points to the signing of Fernandez as a symbol of the shrewd business Swansea have done this summer, the 25-year-old centre-half having been a World Cup starter for Argentina in Brazil before injury struck.

'He is an Argentina international, has played at a very high level with Napoli and was highly considered over there,' Monk said.

'It's important we try and improve the quality all the time and he fits our profile.

'He is a good ball-playing centre-half, he is a good size and suits the way we play. Hopefully he can adapt as quick as possible and offer us the quality he obviously possesses.

'The Premier League is an eye-opener for everyone, but you don't play for the sides he has played for without being physical.

'Coming through in Argentina is very physical, they are a tough people naturally and he should suit us well.

'It's now about getting him up to full fitness as he had an extended break after the World Cup, more than some of our other players like Ki (Sung-yeung) and (Wilfried) Bony, as they reached the final.'

Swansea shocked Manchester United on the opening day of the season to win a league match at Old Trafford for the first time in their history.

Since then Monk has spent the week telling his players not to underestimate Burnley opponents who lost their opening game 3-1 at home to Chelsea.

'There is a concern which is why I've stressed to them, I'm conscious we know how important it is to follow up,' Monk said.

'There's no guarantees but if we can get preparations as best as possible it gives you a chance of delivering a performance you're happy with and can win a game.

'Burnley will be a hard working team. They are together, work for each other and can be a threat.

'I watched the Chelsea game, they started well and got their goal but this is the difference at this level when you come up against players of their standards.

'There is always a chance they can turn it on and play their best which they did, but I thought Burnley did very well.'
