Mass killer Anders Breivik yesterday claimed he plotted his appalling murder spree in London. He said a secret meeting of far-Right fanatics in the capital nine years ago sparked his plans to devastate Norwegian society.

Last night, Scotland Yard was trying to unravel a complex web of links between the crazed neo-Nazi and British extremists. Investigators are desperate to find out if Breivik - who lived in the Norwegian Embassy in London as a child - acted alone or was supported by others plotting similar outrages.

At the centre of the inquiry is the maniac’s claim that there was a 2002 London ‘summit’ of far-Right fundamentalists from across Europe, including two Britons.

In a chilling manifesto begun shortly afterwards, Breivik, 32, boasted of his admiration for the English Defence League and other anti-Islamic organisations.

The document was signed 'Andrew Berwick' - an English translation of his name - and he referred to someone called 'Richard' as his English mentor.

The document was littered with references to English politicians for allowing the spread of Islam. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is branded 'a war criminal'  and accused of aligning himself with Islamist terror groups.

Tony Blair, Jack Straw, Prince Charles and a number of national newspaper journalists are also mentioned. In his ramblings, he boasted there are 80 people across western Europe who are ready to stand up and fight in the same way.

He emailed the document - A European Declaration of Independence - to 5,700 people in the hours before he went on the rampage, the Daily Telegraph revealed. Despite visiting Britain in the past, Breivik is not thought to have been in the country this year.

Experts said the carnage in Oslo and on the island of Utoya is likely to mark a watershed moment in how police counter hard-to-track ‘lone wolf’ fanatics.

As Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that security forces may not be able to stop a similar terror attack:

The full horror of events in Norway 
was only becoming clear last night, more than 48 hours after the country
 suffered its worst atrocity since the Second World War.

At
 least seven people were killed when a car loaded with a home-made 
fertiliser and fuel bomb detonated in Oslo’s government quarter.

A short time later, Breivik ran amok on a nearby holiday island where a political youth camp was being held. Trapped by freezing water on all sides, at least 86 people, mostly young men and women, were shot dead during 90 minutes of horror.

The carnage ended only when armed police, tragically delayed by the isolated location, stormed the island and Breivik surrendered. His lawyer said he ran out of ammunition but police claimed he was carrying a lot more.

The devastation has sent shockwaves around the world, and David Cameron will lead a meeting of security officials today to discuss the UK response.

Ministers insisted they have not taken their eye off the threat of far-Right extremists as resources are pumped into the battle against violent Islamists.

However, the shocking Norwegian bloodbath could trigger a re-think in the approach to right-wing groups.

Investigators are studying a 1,518-page manifesto datelined London and posted online by Breivik just hours before his rampage.

It reveals that the Christian fundamentalist had spent years plotting the attack and kept meticulous records of his preparations.

He shows an obsession with the impact of multiculturalism and immigration, as well as what he sees as the ineffectiveness of mainstream politics.

Writing under the anglicised name Andrew Berwick, the killer declares he is a ‘Justiciar Knight Commander’. He explains that this is a leading member of a ‘re-founded’ Knights Templar group formed at the secret London meeting in April 2002.

Revered by some white supremacists, the Knights Templar were a Christian military order from the Middle Ages recently thrust into the spotlight after they featured in Dan Brown’s bestseller The Da Vinci Code.

Breivik claims the founding group had nine members, whom he does not name, and a further three sympathisers who were not able to attend the meeting.

Breivik says: ‘Our purpose is to seize political and military control of Western European countries and implement a cultural conservative political agenda.

‘The time for dialogue is over. We gave peace a chance. The time for armed resistance has come.’

He shows a detailed knowledge of 
British far-Right extremists and claims to have held discussions with 
members of the EDL, while calling for an equivalent in Norway.

Breivik’s lawyer, Geir Lippestad, said his client spent years crafting the manifesto about his views and had ‘confessed to the factual circumstances’ of the atrocities.

He said: ‘He wanted a change in society and, from his perspective, he needed to force through a revolution. He wished to attack society and the structure of society.’

Sickened: Stephen Lennon, EDL founder member, said Breivik was a 'freak'

Last night the EDL denied any formal link to Breivik. Stephen Lennon, who founded the group in 2009, said he was ‘sickened’ to learn of Breivik’s claims and denounced him as a ‘freak’.

But he told the Daily Mail that he fears others could be inspired to commit similar atrocities ‘within five years’ if they feel their voice is not being heard.

The shocking death toll piles pressure on police who are already well aware of the danger of a shooting atrocity in the run-up to the Olympics.

Armed officers have been training for months to tackle gunmen who may target busy locations such as railway stations or entertainment events.

Mr Hague said it was harder to prevent atrocities by determined individuals than sophisticated networks such as Al Qaeda.

He said: ‘You have to have as many defences in place as you possibly can. But even then you cannot guarantee being able to prevent every attack or every kind of attack.’

Dr Matthew Goodwin, an expert in far-Right politics at Nottingham University, said the authorities have dismissed ‘lone wolf’ extremists for too long and they now pose a massive challenge to Europe.

Dr Goodwin said: ‘We need to accept that this is not an exclusively Norwegian issue. There is clearly a wider pool of potential recruits should the main parties not respond to their grievances.’
