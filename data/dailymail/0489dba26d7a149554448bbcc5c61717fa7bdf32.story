A tenured sociology professor from North Carolina is fighting to keep her job after she was placed on administrative leave for showing students a film about pornography and discussing racism in sports.

According to the New York Daily News, Jammie Price, a professor at Appalachian State University (ASU), was put on leave on March 16 after four of her students complained that she showed a documentary about porn called 'The Price of Pleasure' without prior warning.

Vice Provost of Faculty Affairs Tony Carey said in a letter that other students complained that Price claimed that African-American athletes at the school are getting preferential treatment, called ASU 'racist,' and discussed her own political views, the Watauga Democrat reported.

Price, however, accused the school where she has worked for eight years of violating her academic freedom. She also said that she is being punished for challenging the male-dominated power structure at Appalachian State.

'I think all this happened because I threatened those that are truly in power at Appalachian State,' Price told the Watauga Democrat.

The Chronicle of Higher Education 
reports that Price has hired a lawyer and filed a sex-discrimination 
complaint against ASU through the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission.

Price says she has been banned from entering the College of Arts and Sciences, and barred from discussing her case with students or colleagues.

Price said she is receiving support from groups like the American Association of University Professors, the American Sociological Association and other organizations.

On Wednesday morning, Price presented a petition with 364 signatures to the vice provost, demanding her immediate reinstatement.

Neither Price nor the school administrators commented on the petition or the professor's future at the university.
