A four-year-old boy who has been kept in a sterile 'bubble”' is going to spend Christmas day with the family he hasn’t seen for four months.

Samuel Freeman has a rare condition which means he has no immunity to any germs.

He has spent the past few months with his mother Sadie as doctors at the Great North Children’s Hospital, in Newcastle, prepared him for a bone marrow transplant.

Samuel, from Long Clawson, Leicestershire, has not been able to see his father, Adrian, or older brother, Benjamin, six.

Battle: Samuel Freeman (with his mother Sadie) has a rare condition which means he has no immunity to any germs. He has spent the last four months in a sterile 'bubble' while doctors prepare his body for a bone marrow transplant to give him a new, healthy immune system

But, if they can stay 'germ free', the four will be able to spend Christmas together.

Mrs Freeman, 34, said: 'Samuel has been quite poorly ever since he was about eight weeks old, but we are very hopeful the bone marrow transplant he has just had will be successful in giving him a new fully-fighting immune system.'

She and Samuel were allowed home to Leicestershire on December 6, but are living next door to the family home to make sure that her husband or other son have not picked up any germs before they have Christmas together.

Samuel has spent much of his life in and out of hospital as doctors tried to diagnose what was wrong with him.

Mrs Freeman said: 'Samuel has a long medical history and had to cope with all sorts from lung disease to stomach and bowel issues.

'At one point, his hands, knees and ankles swelled up and it turned out he had severe juvenile arthritis, which was down to his faulty immune system.'

Doctors hope the bone marrow transplant will give Samuel a new fully-fighting immune system

At the beginning of last year, Samuel was referred to the Bubble Unit, in Newcastle - one of two centres in the country specialising in children with deficient immune systems.

His mother said: 'Doctors decided the best thing would be for Samuel to have a bone marrow transplant.

'It was a very difficult decision as there was no guarantee it would be a success. We were very lucky to find a perfect match through the Anthony Nolan charity.

'But before the transplant, Samuel had to have very strong chemotherapy to kill off his own immune system, ready to receive a new healthy system.

'I stayed with him in the bubble, which is a completely sterile hospital room.

'Everything has to be disinfected and you have to scrub up theatre-style before you go in the room. We kept in touch as a family through Skype but it is not the same as cuddles.'

Samuel can now go outside providing he wears a mask. His mother added: 'He is quite a cheeky chap but he is wary of adults and hasn’t had much interaction with other children.

'It has also been very hard on Benjamin since Samuel was born. We have either been away in hospital or so busy nursing Samuel at home, and then I "disappeared" in August to go to Newcastle.

'There is still a way to go and it would just be nice to have a family Christmas Day.'

Mrs Freeman is now determined to raise money and awareness for the Bubble Foundation.

She said: 'It is desperate for funds and I want to do everything I can to support this incredible charity because we owe them so much. It does such vital work.'
