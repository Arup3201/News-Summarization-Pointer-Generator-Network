Barack Obama's behaviour at an important summit in Beijing has enraged Chinese internet users - because he was seen chewing gum.

The U.S. President, a known user of Nicorette, a gum used to stop smoking cravings, was seen chomping away at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) after emerging from his limousine at the Water Cube, the Olympic swimming venue, while traditional dancers performed around him.

Chinese Internet users, used to far greater levels of formality from their leaders, branded him an 'idler' and a 'rapper'.

Furore: Barack Obama's behaviour at an important summit in Beijing has enraged Chinese net users - because he was seen chewing gum. Pictured, the President, who uses Nicorette gum, with Chinese President Xi Jinping

Yin Hong, a professor of journalism at Beijing's Tsinghua University, took to the Sina Weibo micro-blog service to voice his disapproval, reports USA Today.

He said: 'We made this meeting so luxurious, with singing and dancing, but see Obama, stepping out of his car chewing gum like an idler.'

Beijing pulled out all the stops for the gathering, which has seen 21 world leaders including  Russia's Vladimir Putin descend on Beijing, is the biggest event yet hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who took office last year.

Some of the Chinese public are angry at the disruption it has caused.

Authorities have banned wood fires to curb pollution and help ensure blue skies for the leaders instead of the usual grey smog, leading to freezing nights for villagers on the outskirts of Beijing.

'I now sleep under three quilts at night,' said a man who gave only his surname, Bai, as is typical of many Chinese when speaking to journalists.

'There cannot be any smoke, and we cannot heat our brick beds,' said the 68-year-old.

Traditional raised sleeping platforms in frigid northern Chinese houses are often heated by coal and provide warmth during both the day and night.

Authorities also ordered one of China's most popular air pollution-reporting apps to remove data provided by the U.S. embassy, a company spokesman said Tuesday.

The Chinese capital is periodically hit by choking, acrid haze, with particulate levels soaring far beyond recommended limits and public anger mounting over the issue.

While the city government provides its own air pollution data, a separate reading by the US embassy in Beijing is widely considered more reliable.
