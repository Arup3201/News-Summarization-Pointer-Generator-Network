Britain's four leading business groups have voiced their support for Michael Gove’s plan to replace GCSEs with more rigorous exams.

They said the tests have failed to prepare a generation of pupils for the world of work – the same argument the Education Secretary has used to justify a schools revolution.

The Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses have now all welcomed Mr Gove’s call for a rethink of secondary education.

His plans, revealed this week by the Daily Mail, have caused a fierce row in the Coalition as Mr Gove had not discussed them with the Liberal Democrats.

Determined: Education Secretary Michael Gove said he will publish a consultation document in mid-July setting out plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with 'world class exams'

Criticism: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said
the school system 'must be for the many not the few' while Labour 
schools minister Kevin Brennan said Mr Gove's plans would create a 
two-tier system for pupils

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is 
furious that Mr Gove wants to bring in a second qualification – which 
has been compared to the old CSE – alongside an academically rigorous 
O-Level  to give less able pupils a practical qualification that would 
be accepted by employers.

On Thursday Mr Clegg said this would 
create a two-tier system, and vowed to block the plan. Yesterday he 
complained that he was kept in the dark, adding: ‘Neither myself nor the
Prime Minister were aware of it.’ David Cameron’s aides dispute this.

Mr Clegg said he was committed to 
‘raising standards in our schools’ but insisted any changes would have 
to ensure ‘that all children can get ahead through hard work and 
aspiration’.

Despite Lib Dem complaints, Mr Gove intends to publish a consultation document on the proposals in the second week of July.

He has been backed by Mike Harris, 
head of education policy at the Institute of Directors, who said:

When will the PM back the plan?

‘Employers are concerned that standards in British exams have slipped, 
so action to make qualifications more demanding is welcome. We strongly 
support Government reforms to increase standards in all areas of 
education.’

However, he said there were still 
questions about ‘how this new system would provide a world-class 
education for pupils lower down the academic scale’, and stressed: ‘The 
name change is far less important than the practicalities of how to 
deliver the best qualifications in the world for all young people.’

Neil Carberry, the CBI’s head of 
education and skills policy, added: ‘We are concerned that GCSEs in 
their current form may not be delivering. With the leaving age for 
compulsory education about to change to 18, the time is right to review 
the role of a summative exam at 16.'

Adam Marshall, director of policy at 
the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Businesses have steadily lost 
confidence in the ability of the education system to deliver young 
people who are ready for the world of work. If this is a route that 
leads more employers to say more young people are ready for the world of
work, then it will have been successful.’

David Pollard, head of the 
Federation of Small Businesses’ education committee, added: ‘We want the
Government to seize this opportunity to develop an education system 
that places the same importance on quality academic and vocational 
education.’

Mr Gove’s consultation is set to be 
published in the same week that MPs will discuss Mr Clegg’s plans for 
reform of the House of Lords. A Tory MP said: ‘This is a test of Clegg’s
seriousness. If he really backs high standards in schools he should 
shut up and back Gove. If he doesn’t, he can wave his Lords reforms 
goodbye.’

A source close to Mr Gove defended 
plans for two new exams. ‘Some children should not be doing the same 
maths course as someone going to do physics at Cambridge,’ they said, 
‘They should be doing a more appropriate course plus quality vocational 
training.

British pupils have slipped down international league tables in key subjects over the past decade.

The most authoritative comparison is the Programme for International Student Assessment carried out by the OECD. It is based on tests given to 15-year-olds in up to 65 countries.

When first carried out in 2000, the UK was ranked fourth in science, seventh in literacy and eighth in maths. The science ranking fell to 12th in 2003, 14th in 2006 and 16th in 2009.In literacy the country sank to 11th in 2003, 17th in 2006 and 25th in 2009.

The most dramatic slump is in maths, where the ranking was 18th in 2003, 24th in 2006 and 28th in 2009.

Critics point out that the sample in the survey has grown across the years, from 43 countries in 2000 to 65 in the last study in 2009. But, even when this is taken into account, the UK has still slipped proportionately down the tables.

Under Michael Gove’s plans for a revival, pupils will be able to sit the new O-levels at 16 or 17 and the best pupils will be allowed to bypass the exams and go straight to A-levels.

Schools will be given the freedom to enter pupils for the exams when they are ready, rather than forcing everyone to sit them at 16.

Modular study will be abolished, with emphasis put on in-depth work and end of year exams rather than coursework that can be redone until it passes muster.

Pupils studying English literature will be banned from taking the text of plays into exams and maths pupils will be expected to learn complex subjects such as calculus in order to obtain an A grade.

Mr Gove believes the exams need to be tougher to prepare pupils for A-levels, which are also being made more rigorous.

Meanwhile, businesses will be asked to draw up a new CSE-style qualification for less able pupils – around one quarter of pupils struggle even to get D or E grades at GCSE.

Mr Gove thinks it is pointless to make those children sit the same O-level as those who are preparing to read a rigorous academic subject at Oxford or Cambridge.
