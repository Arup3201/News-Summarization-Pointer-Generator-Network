A woman who plummeted 80ft to her death from an exclusive rooftop restaurant has been named today as Rema Begum.

Ms Begum, believed to be 29, fell eight storeys from the top of Sir Terence Conran’s restaurant Coq D’Argent at 6.30pm on 4 September, landing in front of hundreds of horrified commuters outside Bank station.

Eyewitness said she took a sip of wine from her glass on the outdoor terrace in the City, before putting her handbag on the floor and then toppling over the edge of the restaurant.

City of London Coroner’s Court heard today that the provisional cause of death is multiple injuries, but officials are awaiting toxicology results.

No further details emerged at today’s brief inquest hearing.

Witnesses described Ms Begum as being smartly-dressed at the time of her death in a jumper, trousers and trainers.

Glamorous: The eatery was recently filmed for the James Bond sequence of the Olympics opening ceremony

Passers-by and paramedics tried to revive her after the fall, but she was pronounced dead at the scene. 

A diner at the restaurant said people were happily chatting and eating until the moment the woman fell:

Sir Terence Conran owns the restaurant, which has a terrace and formal garden for drinkers and diners

'All of a sudden the restaurant went quiet and a staff member said we had to leave. It was extremely eerie,' he said.

One onlooker who works in the City posted a message on Twitter saying: 'My heart has never beat so deep and fast in all my life. People were crying their eyes out. She landed 20 metres in front of me.

'I just can’t believe how close I was to the whole thing, I don’t think this City life is for me. I mean how bad can things have been 4 her?

'Absolutely numb, just in shock. Can’t get the image out of my mind. I don’t want to end up like her. That city square mile sucks the life out of you.'

Coq D’Argent recently had a starring role in the Olympics opening ceremony, appearing in the James Bond-themed sequence which featured actor Daniel Craig and Her Majesty the Queen.

The film shows the pair apparently 
flying over the eatery on their way to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford,
where they 'parachuted' in for the opening ceremony. Diners were seen 
waving to the helicopter.

Ms Begum is the third person to die after falling at the restaurant, which is housed in the No 1 Poultry building at the heart of the City. 

In May 2007, City employee Richard Ford, 33, died after he plunged from the terrace and landed on a bus.

In July 2009, stockbroker Anjool Malde, 24, leapt to his death from the venue holding a glass of champagne after being suspended from his job at Deutsche Bank. 

Ms Begum's family said in a statement: 'We are incredibly shocked and upset at the untimely and tragic death of our daughter Rema.

'We would now ask for our privacy to be respected at this very difficult time so that we may grieve as a family in peace.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
