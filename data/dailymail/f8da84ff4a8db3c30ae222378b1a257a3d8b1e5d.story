Clutching tightly on to a finger, this adorable little western pygmy possum is actually one of the largest of its species.

Native to Australia, the tiny nocturnal marsupial looks wide-eyed in the daylight as it holds on to the hand of its photographer.

Take by PhD student Amanda McLean of Adelaide University, this candid shot was snapped while on a field trip.

'I just couldn't help taking the picture when the little fellow climbed up and clung on to my finger and sort of sat back on the rest of my hand,' Amanda said.

'It is a western pygmy possum native to southern Australia and was taken on northern Eyre Peninsula, South Australia.

'The pygmy possum was caught during a field trip at a site where it has been studied for 20 years to investigate how the pygmy possum population responds to rainfall in the semi-arid environment.

'Pygmy possums are nocturnal and weigh between eight and 21 grams. They spend most of their time in trees, however, they do come down to the ground in order to change trees when foraging.

'Despite their small size, they can travel very quickly on the ground and this is when they can be caught in pitfall traps, otherwise known as a bucket dug into the ground.'

Amanda - who is studying conservation, molecular ecology, mammals and desert ecology - added that the little creatures can often appear to go missing from any given area for a number of years.

'During dry years pygmy possums occur in very low numbers and can appear to 'disappear' from the area for between five and ten years, however, after heavy rains the population can increase dramatically as they respond to the sudden increase in pollen and insects, which they feed off.

At eight centimetres long, the Western Pygmy Possum is one of the largest of the five types of pygmy possums, also found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea

'This is a very different to more temperate regions where possum numbers tend to be very constant.

'They can also use torpor, a deep sleep-like state, to conserve energy. Torpor is particularly useful when food resources are low or during low temperatures.

'During torpor they curl up into a tight ball and are often found like this in the trap and it can take some effort to wake them up.'
