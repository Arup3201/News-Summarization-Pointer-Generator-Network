Destructive Crusader's winger Nemani Nadolo claimed he was racially abused

Fijian-born Canterbury Crusaders' winger Nemani Nadolo claims he was called a 'chubby N*****' after the side's nail-biting loss to the Waratahs in Saturday's Super Rugby final.

The 120kg winger, who has been described by his coach as a 'hulk of a man,' not only had to deal with the disappointment of the one-point loss but had to swallow the words of an unknown person who he alleged called him an 'UN FIT CHUBBY N****.'

'After all I've done to contribute to tis (sic) lovely city of Christchurch to be called an 'UN FIT CHUBBY N****.' is disappointing. #hurtful' he posted to Twitter in the early hours of Monday morning.

The incredibly talented winger, who scored a try in the Crusaders' 30-31 point loss, said it was 'hurtful' he was called 'unfit' for the game after having given much to Christchurch.

The Canterbury Crusaders has confirmed it is investigating the source of the comment.

Nadolo has not given any indication as to who made the comment, but Crusaders Coach Todd Blackadder told Daily Mail Australia it was made during after-hours celebrations back in Christchurch.

Nemani Nadolo responded to a racial taunt by posting the allegations on twitter

'Nemani was out with the boys at drinks and someone made a really racist slur,' he said.

He confirmed Nadolo had never met the person, he called the Christchurch's 'lowest common denominator' and the club wasn't investigating further.

'It is one of those really disappointing things shouldn't tarnish all

'He did a bloody good job to react.' 'He took it on the chin didn't tell any of the Crusaders team mates.'

The first they heard of it was when he tweeted it on social media, he said, and Nadolo has since tweeted to followers to thank them for their support since he publicly airing the comment.

'Thank u 2 all 4 the kind tweets. whatever has been said is said. I'm just blessed 2 b here. not gonna let one person ruin it. #movingon'

Since his first tweet, many former union greats backed into his corner and gave their own words of encouragement.

Former Auckland Blues player Ben Atiga said he was he was disgusted but "not surprised" by the abuse, 'One of my first outings there was quite similar,' while rugby league legend Monty Betham said the comment represented the 'blinded minority'.

'New Zealand loves you. You're the man and started the Crusader resurgence this year.'

Nadolo scored a try in the nail-biting loss to the Waratah's and was arguably the best player on the night

The winger made a number of destructive runs down the Waratahs' right edge all night

Nadolo, a Fijian, has captained the national team the Fijian Warriors and spent one Super Rugby season with the Waratahs in 2009.

Crusaders' coach Todd Blackadder said at the start of the season he was set to be one of the most exciting players in the 2014 Super Rugby competition, and he didn't disappoint.

Nadolo was one of the star performers of the Super Rugby season, scoring 12 tries in 14 matches.

'He is an absolute hulk of a man, yet he can fly down the field like you wouldn't believe for a man that size.'

The Crusader has been compared players like former All Black Jonah Lomu, and was one ofÂ  five new faces to join the Crusaders' squad this year.
