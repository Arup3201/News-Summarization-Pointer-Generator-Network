This haunting photo shows a 21-year-old man posing on a Virginia trestle - just one week before he was struck and killed by a train while walking along the same tracks with his girlfriend.

In the image, posted on Instagram, Jonathan Gregoire is seen standing at the edge of the trestle, near Lychburg, where he died and Victoria Bridges, also 21, was seriously injured on Saturday.

Alongside the picture, the Liberty University student wrote lyrics from singer Noah Gunderson's 'Ledges', including: 'Here, I stand in the land of the rocks in the valley, trying to be a better man.'

Mr Gregoire, from Wilbraham, Massachusetts, and Miss Bridges, from Newport News, were walking along the tracks with a group of friends at around 4.20pm when a northbound train approached.

Although Mr Gregoire was fatally hit by the vehicle, Miss Bridges incredibly survived after leaping 100 feet off the railway bridge and landing on the terrain below.

Citing lyrics: The image, posted on Instagram, was accompanied by several lyrics from Noah Gunderson's 'Ledges', including: 'Here, I stand in the land of the rocks in the valley, trying to be a better man'

Following the impact, the train driver told a dispatcher: 'There were three people that we could see, one beside the tracks, two out on the tracks,' according to ABC news. 

'As soon as I got there, it was too late. Then I heard a thump. One of them, looked like a girl, jumped. And I heard the one thump, I’m pretty sure the girl jumped and I might have hit the guy.'

Paramedics rushed to the scene, where they found Miss Bridges lying on the ground. She was airlifted to Lynchburg General Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, WDBJ reported. She remains in a stable condition. Mr Gregoire was pronounced dead at the scene.

On Sunday, it emerged that Mr Gregoire, a senior majoring in business administration-marketing, had widely spoken of his passion for hiking, exploring and other outdoor pursuits on social media.

He had also recently posted a series of messages about the meaning of life and death, with his last Facebook post reading: 'If life ends in the grave, then we have no ultimate purpose for living.'

Another recent message said: 'I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God.'

Not uncommon: Witnesses say accidents like this are not uncommon for the trestle located above James River at Riverside Park near Lynchburg, VA

According to News Advance, more than one other person was walking along the trestle with Mr Gregoire and Miss Bridges when the train approached. However, the others were walking beside the tracks, not on them.

Members of the friendship group were seen crying and walking behind the stretcher carrying Miss Bridges after the incident. Public safety officials were at the scene for approximately two hours.

The incident is being investigated by Lynchburg Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division. Foul play is not suspected, according to ABC News.

Robin Chapman, spokesman for Norfolk Southern, told News Advance that many use the trestle as a shortcut home or simply for the view from the trestle.

Witnesses told ABC 13 that incidents like this are becoming common on this particular train trestle located above the James River at Riverside Park.  

'It's kind of becoming a problem with, you know, the children and the teenagers that want to come up here and get on the railroad track,' local resident Julie Burgess told ABC 13.

'They're pretty much playing Russian roulette with their life.'

In October 2012, a man was struck and killed by a train while crossing the tressle. A year earlier, another Liberty University student died - and their friend was seriously injured - there.
