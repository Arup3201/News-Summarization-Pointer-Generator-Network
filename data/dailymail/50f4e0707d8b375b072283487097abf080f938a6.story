Nellie Geraghty died from her injuries after her handbag containing the ashes of her late husband Frank was snatched

An elderly widow who died after she was robbed of her handbag containing her husband's ashes was allegedly set upon by a drug addict  desperate for cash to fund his habit.

Nellie Geraghty, 79, was found minutes away from her home with the strap of her handbag still firmly in her grasp having suffered a heart attack and serious head injuries form which she later died in hospital.

Drug addict Mark Royle, 37, wrenched the handbag from the 4ft10in lady and 'kicked, punched or stamped' her in the head causing severe damage, a court head today.

She was found lying face down in the mud battered, bruised and unconscious still clutching the strap of the bag that contained her husband’s ashes and over £100 in cash, Manchester Crown Court was told.

Mr Royle, a known drug addict of no fixed abode, moved on the streets of Shaw, Oldham, where Mrs Geraghty lived in a bungalow at a sheldered accommodation for the elderly.

Mrs Geraghty had lived alone since her husband Frank passed away in the mid-nineties.

Although described as 'active and independent' she missed her husband and had taken to carrying some of his ashes with her in her shoulder bag or handbag whenever she left her house.

Prosecution say Mr Royle attacked and robbed Mrs Geraghty of her shoulder bag and its contents on November 24th last year.

Mrs Geraghty was on her way to her regular luncheon club around midday when she was attacked around midday.

But the ‘active and independent’ lady only managed to get 100 yards from her home.

She died from 'a catalogue of injuries to her head and body' less than 48 hours later without ever gaining consciousness Peter Wright QC, prosecuting told the jury.

Mr Royle denies the charges of murder, an alternative charge of manslaughter and robbery.

Mr Wright said Mr Royle was a user of hard drugs at the time and was funding his drug use in part by committing crime.

‘On this occasion he resorted to a crime of violence to fund his drug habit.’

The attack on Mrs Geraghty was so violent that she was rendered unconscious and suffered such severe head injuries that she required treatment in an intensive care unit.

Prosecution say that by delivering at least one heavy blow via a punch, kick or stamp to a frail old lady could only mean the defendant intended to inflict really serious harm.

Mr Wright said the jury would hear evidence from a neuropathologist who will say that the injuries to the head were caused by 'considerable force' which caused the brain to shift.

Despite warnings from her close family, Mrs Geraghty carried large sums of money with her.

It was not uncommon for her to have between £130 and £200 in her purse.

She was last seen passing the home of a neighbour who was hanging out her washing and appeared to be fit and well on her way to a cut-through to Shaw town centre.

Mrs Geraghty had her bag over her right shoulder and was following her usual route to the lunch club.

Mr Wright said: ‘Within minutes of her last sighting, she was violently attacked and relieved of her shoulder bag and its contents which in all likelihood included a substantial amount of cash and her late husband’s ashes.’

‘Her bag was missing. It appeared to have been wrenched from her grasp and snapped at the strap. Notwithstanding the fact that she was deeply unconscious, she still had hold of the strap from which the bag appeared to have been torn.’

Prosecution said Mrs Geraghty’s injuries were consistent with her having been knocked to the ground by a violent blow or punch or a kick or stamp as she lay on the ground.

‘Either way,’ Mr Wright added: ‘We say this was a violent attack on a vulnerable and elderly lady in which she sustained serious injuries that later led to her death.’

Mr Royle was spotted cycling around in
the nearby town centre on local CCTV from the day of the robbery and 
riding away from the scene afterwards.

The
prosecution said earlier in the day Royle was desperate for drugs and 
had tried to sell his mountain bike to raise money to feed his 
addiction.

Mr Royle had left
a drug addict friend’s home that morning in order to find some money. 
He returned about an hour later with a substantial amount of cash, 
including crisp £20 notes.

Royle claimed he had broken into a car and stolen a laptop which he sold for cash.

There was no record of any such theft that day.

Mr Wright added: ‘Moreover, on his return, Royle seemed concerned about his appearance and was keen to obtain a change of clothing.’

Mobile telephone records link him to a drug dealer after the theft of the handbag and later Royle left Shaw for Manchester, where he stayed with another know drug user.

During that time, the friend remember a conversation with the defendant during which Royle admitted doing handbag snatches and showed him a substantial amount of cash and asked him to buy drugs with it.

Prosecution said Mr Royle had told his friend he got it from a handbag  admitting he had done a snatch from a woman that had ‘gone a bit naughty.’

Royle was eventually arrested on December 9 after members of the public chased him down after he returned snached a lady’s handbag in Rochdale town centre.

Questioned about Mrs Geraghty’s death, he admitted being the cyclist caught on CCTV in the area but declined to answer further questions about his movements later that day.

The trial continues.
