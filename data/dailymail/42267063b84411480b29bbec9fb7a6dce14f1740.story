Prince Charles has given his new grandson's name the royal seal of approval, describing George as a 'very good name' but adding that he'll be called 'Georgie in no time'.

Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were congratulated on the new arrival by throngs of wellwishers at the Whitstable Oyster Festival in Kent - a week on from the eagerly anticipated royal birth.

The couple were showered with gifts for Prince George including a tiny lemon T-shirt which Charles can pass on to the baby as a souvenir from his trip to the festival.

Game: Prince Charles ate two oysters as he visited Whitstable's annual oyster fair - and joked to onlookers, 'What I do for Whitstable!'

Shona Corcoran, 38, from Whitstable, said she and her three-year-old daughter Hannah felt that they should bring a gift for the baby prince and the perfect opportunity presented itself today as they passed it on to Charles.

'It's one of the Whitstable Oyster Festival T-shirts and we just wanted to give something to George.'He said, 'Oh, that's fantastic, thank you. I'm sure he'll like to wear that',' she said.

Down the hatch! Charles gets stuck in: Going...

...going, gone. Kindhearted Camilla is on hand in case of a spillage, too

Charles met a woman who also has a grandchild called George.

Margaret Quinney, 67, said: 'He was talking about the grandchildren.

'He said there are lots of grandparents around.'

It was after Charles met Mrs Quinney and her daughter Jo that he said: 'George - a very good name.'

Mrs Quinney, grandmother to six-month-old George, said they 'just had a feeling' the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would call their son George.

'Now are you going to get this?' Photographers missed Prince Charles's first attempt at eating the local delicacy - and urged him to down another

'We just had a feeling. We knew it was going to be George,' she said.

Her daughter Jo said she thinks it will now be a 'very popular' name for baby boys.

Sonia Rule, 38, whose partner works for the Whitstable RNLI Lifeboats crew said she heard Charles joke that his grandson will 'be known as Georgie in no time'.

Charles and Camilla met with local fishermen during their visit to the week-long festival which dates back to Norman times.

While Charles tried two oysters, his wife declined, saying: 'I love them but I ate a bad one once.'Charles joked with photographers who were keen to get a snap of him eating the local delicacy, having missed him eat his first.

'I've just tried one!' He said.

Adding: 'Now are you sure you're going to get this?'

Gift: Charles looked delighted to receive a little yellow T-shirt from the oyster festival, given to him especially for his new grandchild

'It's fantastic, I'm sure he'll like to wear that!': Charles gratefully accepts the gift from Shona Corcoran, 38, of Whitstable, and her three-year-old daughter Hannah

Natalie Adams, 38, who was among a group of mothers and babies enjoying the sunshine at the harbour, said Charles also joked with her about having eaten the two oysters.

'He said 'what I do for Whitstable. They are an acquired taste',' she said.

Ms Adams, a member of the yacht club, said: 'It's a lovely community in Whitstable.

'Friends all supporting friends.'

At the beginning of their visit, the couple joined local community samba band Samba Pelo Mar on stage where they helped drum to the beat of a carnival-themed tune.

As Charles and Camilla approached their car to leave, crowds called out: 'Thanks for coming!'

Whitstable is famous for its native oyster. Popular since Roman times, they are farmed seasonally, and are only available between May and August.

The nutrient-rich waters that flow from the Thames Estuary, mixed with salt water from the North Sea, are said to provide the perfect growing environment for the algae which form the oysters' diet.
