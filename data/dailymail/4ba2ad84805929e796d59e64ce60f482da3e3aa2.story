Adolf Hitler's personal copy of Mein Kampf which was found in his Munich apartment after his death in 1945 is to go up for auction.

The book, a 1932 version of the Fuhrer's autobiography, is believed to be the only of Hitler's personal copies in existence.

Auctioneer Craig Gottlieb, who has sold Nazi memorabilia in the past, believes it could fetch more than £62,000 in the online sale.

While it is likely that Hitler owned many copies of his own autobiography, he almost certainly read this one as it was found in his personal library - making it one-of-a-kind

Mein Kampf – or My Struggle - is the autobiographical manifesto by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, where he outlined his political ideology and future plans for Germany. 

The book was written by Hitler following the failed Munich Putsch in November 1923 and was first published in July 1925.

Hitler's personal copy was part of a group of the German leader's belongings that were liberated from his Munich apartment in 1945 by US soldier Joseph Ben Lieber.

The book, along with others from his library, was sold to Gottlieb last year along with Hitler's hat, shirt, medals, and other items.

The manifesto, which Hitler wrote in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, even has the German leader's own bookplate on the inside cover

The text was found in the Fuhrer's Munich apartment after the defeat of Germany in 1945 by US soldier Joseph Ben Lieber who kept it until now

Mr Gottlieb added: 'The chain of custody of the book is unbroken since 1945. 

'This particular artifact is one of the most profound in the group, which makes the provenance that supports the artifact so crucial to its value.'

'This artifact is historically significant and I would love to see it go to a museum.

'However, market realities are such that it will probably find a home with a book collector who appreciates its historic significance.'

The book is described and mentioned in several key documents that Gottlieb has, copies of which will be included in the sale.

Mr Gottleib has attracted criticism for his sales of Nazi artifacts in the past, which have included two oil paintings of Hitler's parents, likely commissioned by the Fuhrer himself.

He added: 'I am acutely aware of the controversial nature of some of the things I sell but controversial or not, they're a part of history and shunning them is like shunning the history they represent.

'For some, a museum or a book does it, but for me, I have to hold an artefact in my hands - they're like little time machines.'
