The new Boots Protect and Perfect serum - an updated version of the sell-out 2007 product

The original triggered such a frenzy that desperate shoppers were forced to join waiting lists and bottles began changing hands on eBay for almost four times the original price.

So it’s little surprise that an updated version of the Boots Protect and Perfect serum – containing a handful of new ingredients – is tipped to become an instant best-seller when it launches tomorrow.

The cream first caused a stampede at the tills in 2007 after a BBC Horizon documentary revealed the £17 product had been clinically proven to reduce signs of ageing.

Boots is now launching an updated – and more expensive – version with several new ingredients, including Matrixyl 3000, which can dramatically increase the amount of collagen in the skin and improve its elasticity.

And tests on the ‘advanced’ serum – carried out at the University of Manchester – have shown that the new formula is even more effective than the original.

Boots has been testing the serum on more than 2,600 volunteers, many of whom went without mirrors for a month to help them pinpoint the differences.

The trial showed that after four weeks, eight out of ten women experienced ‘significant anti-ageing benefits’.

Diana Wilkins, 38, was one of the women taking part in the trials.

The mother of four said she was normally ‘massively cynical’ about claims made by beauty companies.

The updated formula includes specialised peptides, which are the building blocks of proteins that help the skin repair itself.

New ingredient Matrixyl 3000 has been shown to boost collagen levels in skin, increasing its elasticity. When combined with another peptide – acetyl dipeptide – it becomes even more effective at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

The serum also contains a patented cocktail of antioxidants as well as Salicylic acid – which helps exfoliate the skin – and Hyaluronic acid, which is responsible for making the surface of the face appear plumper thanks to its ability to bind water into the skin.

But she added: ‘I used this and noticed a difference in the depth of lines and overall smoothness. It takes a lot for me to believe things work but I was taken aback.’

Skin expert Professor Chris Griffiths, from Manchester University, said: ‘Boots carried out robust, clinical trials in line with our understanding of skin repair. The results are impressive.’

And Dr Mike Bell, a skincare adviser at Boots, said: ‘The identification of anti-ageing solutions has to come from an in-depth understanding of the ageing process.

‘This has been the most rigorous and complex product development we have ever undertaken.

After four weeks more than 85 per cent of users say their fine lines are reduced and their skin looks younger. Normally it would take at least eight weeks to see this sort of result.’

He also explained that testers continued to notice improvements after the initial month was up, saying: ‘The benefits grow with time.

'After three months there was a significant improvement to crows’ feet around the eyes.’

The Protect and Perfect Advanced serum, which costs £23.95, is designed for people aged between 25 and 35. The Protect and Perfect Advanced Intense serum is aimed at over-35s and costs £24.95.
