Despite a miserable end to their home World Cup earlier this year Brazil have enjoyed a revival since Dunga's re-appointment as boss, winning all five of their games without conceding a goal.

Barcelona star Neymar and the rest of the Brazil squad completed their final training session at the Ernst Happel Stadium.

Dunga will be hoping that trend continues on Tuesday against Austria, who have not lost a game for over a year and are top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group.
