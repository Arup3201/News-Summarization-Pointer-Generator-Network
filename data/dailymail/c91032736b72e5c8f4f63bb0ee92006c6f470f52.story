Sales of fresh fruit and vegetables slumped last year, suggesting that shoppers are wasting less food.

Britons bought 91,000 tonnes fewer vegetables and nearly 40,000 tonnes less fruit in 2013 but price rises – especially for potatoes – meant the value of sales increased.

However, the hot summer and mild winter saw consumers buy more salads.

Sales of fresh fruit and vegetables slumped last year, suggesting that shoppers are wasting less food

The drop in sales of fruit and vegetables  – of which health experts recommend we should eat five portions a day – could be attributed to greater awareness of food waste, with Government figures showing that 15million tons of food are discarded every year in the UK.

Avneet Chana, analyst at consumer experts Kantar Worldpanel that released the figures, said: ‘Vegetables volume decline is driven by potatoes. Volume decline in potatoes is further driven by younger shoppers moving to other carbohydrates such as rice and pasta.’

Laurence Olins, chairman of produce supplier Poupart, suggested the variation in sales could also be down to changes in consumer behaviour.

He told The Grocer magazine: ‘Consumers are shopping on a tighter budget and they are cannier – they are buying more frequently and in smaller quantities, and they are wasting less.’
