It is believed that Guy Pelly has been asked by his close friend Prince William to take on the role of godparent

He's not the obvious choice for someone to provide the third in line to the throne with spiritual guidance and a strong moral compass.

But it is believed controversial nightclub owner Guy Pelly may have been chosen as the first of Prince George’s godparents.

It was reported yesterday that Mr Pelly has been asked by his close friend Prince William to take on the role when his son is christened.

Sources say Mr Pelly, 31, is ‘thrilled to bits’ and has been celebrating the news with pals. But while it is true to say that Mr Pelly is one of William’s inner circle, the inclusion of his name has come as a surprise to some.

Mr Pelly, the son of wealthy Kent landowners, has a chequered public history. He was exposed by a tabloid newspaper in 2006 smoking cannabis at a party at which Prince William was present.

It also emerged that he was with Prince Harry when he hired a Nazi uniform to wear to a private birthday party in 2005 – and went to the same party tastelessly dressed as the Queen.

Since then he has carved out a career as a nightclub owner and promoter, although one of his bars, Public, in Chelsea, was closed down last year after repeated complaints about the drunken behaviour of its clientele.

Mr Pelly himself has been accused of drink driving, and received an eight-week driving ban for doing 129mph on a dual carriageway last year.

In line with royal tradition, Prince George is likely to have six godparents and friends say they can think of other ‘more likely’ candidates such as William’s best friend Thomas Van Straubenzee, his former private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and ex-nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke.

Several of Kate’s friends are also in the running, along with her sister, Pippa Middleton.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said last night that it was ‘too early to discuss who will be godparents’.

Prince George’s christening will be held in the autumn, most likely October.

William himself has six godparents, most of them his father’s cousins.
