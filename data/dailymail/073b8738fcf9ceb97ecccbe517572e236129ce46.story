Paris police today conceded that the stabbing of a French soldier was inspired by the terrorist murder of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Private Cedric Cordier, 23, was stabbed in the neck while on patrol in the business district of the French capital on Saturday evening. He is now recovering in hospital.

The attacker, who has not been caught, was 6ft2in, of North African origin and wore a long, Arab garment called a djellaba.

In a copycat of an ambush in London in 
which a British serviceman was murdered, the attacker struck in front of
 dozens of passers-by, stabbing his victim in the throat and neck.

The manhunt for a suspected terrorist who tried to kill a French soldier is still underway in Paris

The soldier in uniform was armed and was patrolling as part of France's Vigipirate anti-terrorist surveillance scheme

Police spokesman Christophe Crepin 
said: ‘You don’t have to be a great observer to see that people are 
taking inspiration from what’s happened abroad.’

Politicians also acknowledged the 
similarities. ‘The sudden violence... could lead one to believe there 
might be a comparison with what happened in London,’ said interior 
minister Manuel Valls.

And defence minister Jean-Yves Le 
Drian said that attack had undoubtedly been an ‘attempt to kill’ the 
soldier, whose regiment had recently fought in Afghanistan.

Two comrades from the 4th Cavalry Regiment were with him, and carrying automatic rifles, but they failed to react before the man ran off.

‘We are looking through video surveillance footage,’ said an officer at the scene of the crime. ‘He was seen taking off his Arab-style robes and running away wearing European clothing.’

France's defence minister said the soldier stabbed in Paris on Saturday was targeted because he was in the army and vowed to continue his country's 'implacable' fight against terrorism

Detectives are convinced that the 
attacker was ‘inspired’ by the savage murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, who 
was allegedly hacked down by two radical Islamists in Woolwich, south 
London, last Wednesday. 

While
 Drummer Rigby was off duty, Private Cordier was on an anti-terrorism 
patrol in La Defense business district of west Paris.

France’s defence minister Jean Yves Le 
Drian said that attack had undoubtedly been an ‘attempt to kill’ the 
soldier, whose regiment had recently fought in Afghanistan.

'Copycat': Unlike Drummer Rigby, who was off-duty when he was ambushed, Private Cordier was on anti-terrorism patrol in La Defence at the time of the attack

Private Cordier lost a considerable amount of blood but would survive, and is being treated at the nearby Percy military hospital.

France is considered a hotbed of radical Islamists, and the country’s Vigipirate anti-terrorist surveillance plan is currently in action. 

Last year Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French-Algerian Islamist, murdered three French soldiers near the south west city of Toulouse during a killing spree which also claimed the lives of four civilians.
