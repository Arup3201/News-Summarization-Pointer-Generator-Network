James Payne died in November 2012, when he was six-weeks-old, after developing a cough and wheezing

A six-week-old baby died after three doctors failed to spot a treatable illness.

Over nine days James Payne was seen by a GP, an out-of-hours doctor and then a locum after he developed a nasty cough – but he was sent home each time.

Hours after the third visit, his mother Mandy, 33, found him lifeless in his Moses basket with his face blue and blood coming from his nose.

She desperately tried to resuscitate him on the living room floor in front of her two-year-old daughter, but could not save him.

Mrs Payne said: ‘I screamed and cradled him while I called the ambulance but I knew then he was gone and it was too late.

'I put him on the floor and desperately tried to resuscitate him. I can remember the taste of his blood in my mouth and thinking “I can’t believe this is happening to me”.’

An inquest heard the cause of death was a build-up of fluid in his lungs and inflammation of his throat caused by a viral infection.

One of the doctors told the inquest that hospital treatment would have saved James.

All three claimed they were not aware of his breathing problems – a claim the family disputes.

Recording a narrative verdict, Southend Coroner Yvonne Blake said ‘no organisation identified’ the illness.

Mrs Payne and her husband Andrew, 38, plan to sue the NHS.

Mr Payne, a surveyor, said: ‘I feel James was robbed from me, from my family – it is someone’s fault and someone has to be held accountable for that. It is an unbearable loss which only someone who has lost a baby can ever understand.

‘It is an unimaginable pain I feel daily and I want answers as to why this was ever allowed to happen.’

James' parents, Mandy and Andrew, took him to three different GPs but they claim each one failed to provide him with the treatment that could have saved his life. They are pictured with their daughter, Chloe, 2

Mrs Payne, of Hadleigh, Essex, first 
took her son to her local GP when he had a bad cough in November last 
year. But he was sent away with paracetamol and nasal drops.

Less than a week later she called the
NHS out-of-hours doctor service and was told to take her son to 
Southend Hospital to be seen by a doctor, who said he suspected a 
possible viral infection but claimed that was normal in a child of his 
age.

Hours after his third visit to a doctor, James' mother found him lifeless in his cot with blood coming from his nose. She tried to resuscitate him in front of two-year-old Chloe but he was already dead

On the morning of James’s death, Mrs 
Payne made an appointment with a locum doctor at her GP surgery. She 
says the doctor did not examine her son’s chest despite telling him that
his breathing had worsened.

The doctor told the inquest that he 
could not remember if he had removed James’s clothes or exposed his 
chest for examination. He denied that Mrs Payne had told him that her 
son had a wheezy cough.

An inquest into James' death heard he died from a build-up of fluid in his lungs caused by a viral infection. His mother says she doesn't know how to tell Chloe what happened to her brother

On November 12, 2012, Mrs Payne took James to the Kent Elm Surgery in Eastwood because he had developed a bad cough.

Dr Maciej Bobnis gave him nasal drops and paracetamol.

Less than a week later James' breathing became wheezy so Mrs Payne took him to an out-of-hours GP at Southend University Hospital.

Here, Dr Hewa Dharmarathna concluded that James looked 'well' and said he probably had a normal viral infection.

On the morning of James' death, nine days after he was first taken to a doctor, Mrs Payne took him back to Kent Elm Surgery where he saw the locum, Dr Balavinayak Mohankumar.

The doctor claims he was not told that James was wheezing - Mrs Payne strongly refutes this claim.

Later that day, Mrs Payne found James dead in his cot.

Just hours later, Mrs Payne found her son dead.

Mr Payne said: ‘As a father I look to
protect my family and I feel like I failed as a dad.

'I loved him so 
much and we lost him far, far too soon.

'Every day I wake up and the first 
two, three seconds, it hits you all over again and a piece of your heart
simply breaks again.

'And it continues to break all day.

‘I drive past the park and I see 
fathers and their sons having a kick about and I know I will never be 
able to do that with my son.

'I’ve had that taken away from me and I am 
incredibly angry. I want someone to be held accountable.’

A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘We
are deeply saddened and concerned to hear of this case, and would like 
to express our deepest sympathy to the family.

'However, we cannot 
comment on individual cases.’

A spokesman for Southend University 
Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to
the family and will continue to support them at this sad time.’

During the hearing all three doctors claimed they were not told about the infant's breathing problems - with one GP admitting hospital treatment might have saved his life - but his parents strongly refute these claims
