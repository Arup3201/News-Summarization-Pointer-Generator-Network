Nepal celebrated the 60th anniversary of the conquest of Mount Everest today by honouring the first mountaineers to reach the highest spot on Earth.

Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Everest on May 29, 1953. Since then thousands of people have scaled the 29,035ft (8,850m) peak.

Four days of ceremonies to celebrate the 'Everest Diamond Jubilee' reached their own peak today as the two of the grandchildren of those first summiteers laid garlands on statues of the now-legendary pair.

Amelia Rose Hillary and Tashi Tenzing 
joined Italian climbing celebrity Reinhold Messner and the last 
surviving member of the 1953 expedition, Kancha Sherpa, in a horse-drawn
chariot parade through Kathmandu.

Mr
Messner was the first climber to scale Everest without using bottled 
oxygen and the first person to climb all 14 of the world's highest 
peaks.

'I am here in Nepal 
again for filming ... not any more for climbing,' he said, adding he did
reach the base camp of Mount Kanchenjunga during his visit.

'I am full of energy and full of enthusiasm for this country.'

He was among many climbers who 
travelled to Nepal for the celebrations, who were honoured with flower 
garlands and scarfs as they took part in the ceremony.

As
they paraded around the Nepalese capital they were followed by hundreds
of revellers who marched holding banners to mark the anniversary.

The
British-funded trip to the summit of Everest in 1953 changed 
mountaineering forever and made New Zealander Hillary and Nepalese guide
Norgay into household names.

'We
should be proud that two great people have opened the door not just to 
climbing Everest but to tourism for the Nepalese people,' said Tenzing's
grandson Tashi Tenzing.

'It is a great day for us and we as a family are very happy. We are basically in cloud nine today.'

Tenzing
Norgay died in Darjeeling, India, in 1986 at age 71. Hillary, who died 
of heart failure in 2008 at the age of 88, attended the golden jubilee 
celebration of the conquest in 2003.

Back in Britain a 'flashmob' of former and current mountaineers joined the sons of Tensing and Hillary at the signing of a newly-released book on the expedition in London today.

Peter Hillary and Jamling Tenzing Norgay, joined mountaineers Sir Chris Bonington, Stephen Venables and Doug Scott, as well as Kenton Cool, who earlier this month became the first person to scale the three peaks of Everest's Western Cwm in one climb, at Stanfords bookshop in central London.

The Conquest Of Everest - Original Photographs From The Legendary First Ascent features a previously unpublished collection of photographs from the climb, put together by the late George Lowe, a member of Hillary's team, with help from family friend and historian Huw Lewis-Jones.

The book of photographs includes landscapes, candid portraits and action shots portraying the day-to-day moments of the historic expedition.

Mr Lowe was the last surviving member of the team until he died earlier this year aged 89.

News of the success of the expedition to scale Everest reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation on June 2, 1953.

It was the ninth British mountaineering expedition to attempt the first ascent of Mount Everest, and the first confirmed to succeed.

The British felt under particular pressure, as the French had received permission to mount an expedition in 1954, and the Swiss another in 1955, meaning the British would not have another chance at Everest until 1956 or later.

The 'Icefall party' reached Base Camp at 17,900 feet on 12 April 1953. A few days were then taken up, as planned, in establishing a route through the Khumbu Icefall, and once this had been opened teams of Sherpas moved tons of supplies up to Base.

A series of camps were created, slowly reaching higher up the mountain, with groups of climbers gradually leap-frogging each other as they inched their way to the summit.

By May 21, Wilfrid Noyce and Sherpa Annullu had reached the South Col, just under 26,000 feet, and the first of two previously selected climbing pairs, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, set out for the summit five days later.

Using closed-circuit oxygen the pair successfully achieved the first ascent of the 28,700ft South Summit, coming within 300ft of the final summit until they were forced to turn back due to problems with their oxygen equipment.

The next day the expedition made its second and final assault on the summit with the second climbing pair, the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal.

They reached the summit at 11:30 am on 29 May 1953, climbing the South Col route.

Dr Lewis-Jones, who worked with him 
for several years before his death to put together his memoirs and 
photographs from the climb said today's signing had proved to be 'quite a
mountaineers' flashmob'.

'It's right that we do everything we can to remind the world of the story of the guys of '53, quite amazing men,' he said.

He added that having Peter Hillary and Jamling Tenzing Norgay at the occasion was particularly special.

'These guys have lived with it all their life, it's a special moment when guys come together on the 60th anniversary, but to be together at that exact moment that their fathers reached the summit is great,' he said.

'Both Peter and Jamling gave little speeches and reflected on Everest 60 years on.'

Dr Lewis-Jones said he was proud to have worked on the book with Mr Lowe, adding: 'A book is a book, it's not climbing Everest but it was massively emotional.

'It was a huge honour for me to have an opportunity to work with George on a book.

'You don't always get a chance a work with your heroes.'

Other climbers who have summited Everest were also honoured in today's celebrations in Kathmandu.

'Sixty years ago exactly on this day, Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made what many people thought impossible possible. So we are very thankful and grateful to them ... we can all make many of our impossible dreams possible,' said Shailee Basnet, 29, a Nepalese climber who scaled Everest in 2008.

Basnet is one of a few Nepalese women climbers and is leading a team of women on a mission to climb all 14 of the highest peaks in the world.

The anniversary celebrations will continue today with a reception at the Royal Geographical Society which will also be attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

In Nepal a gala event at the palace of the country's former royal family will be attended by a host of famous mountaineering figures.
