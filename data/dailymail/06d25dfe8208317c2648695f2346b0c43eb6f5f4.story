TOMS shoes is teaming up with Target for a special-edition collection of shoes, accessories and apparel, just in time for the holiday season.

In keeping with the TOMS business model, each purchase from the collection will result in a donation of either a blanket through the Red Cross, or a week of meals through Feeding America. With every pair of shoes bought, another pair will be sent to a child in need.

What's more, each item will be just $50 or less - making it easy to be charitable this holiday season.
