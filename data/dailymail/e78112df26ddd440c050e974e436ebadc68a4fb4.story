Stewart Downing believes West Ham should target European football for next year after their impressive start to the new season.

After last weekend's 2-0 win over QPR, Sam Allardyce's seventh-placed side sit above Arsenal and Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League and are just three points behind third-placed Southampton.

The Hammers have earned plaudits for their attacking brand of football with Downing the heartbeat of their positive performances.

The former £20million Liverpool star's magnificent form prompted boss Allardyce to hail him as the 'best midfielder in the league'.

Downing is quick to play down his manager's glowing praise, however.

But he does hope to continue to shine as he looks to guide West Ham into Europe for the first time since 2006.

'It's a great compliment. Maybe exaggerated a little! But as a player it gives you great confidence and I'm really enjoying playing right now,' he said, answering questions from West Ham supporters on the club's official Twitter feed.

'Realistically, I don't see why we can't aim for Europe if we carry on like how we've started.'

Downing has been successfully remoulded by boss Allardyce as a central midfielder in recent weeks, playing behind strikers Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho.

And the former Middlesbrough and Aston Villa winger revealed he is relishing his new role in the team.

'The new players have settled quickly and the formation is working well,' he said.

'At the minute, the way the team's playing, I prefer playing behind the strikers.'

'Obviously I'd like to score more goals, but as long as I'm playing well and the team is I don't think about it.'

Despite calls for Downing to win back his place in national side, boss Roy Hodgson has overlooked him for England's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton last week, Downing admitted he was disappointed to have been overlooked, adding the likes of fellow Hammers' Mark Noble and James Tomkins also deserve a chance.

'Maybe he just wants to go for younger players, which I guess is fair,' said the 30-year-old.

'(Noble) has been doing it consistently for seven or eight years. And James Tomkins.

'I think there are a few players who should feel disappointed.

‘But sometimes it’s difficult. You see the squad and there are a lot of players who are not playing for their clubs, but they’re getting picked.'

Downing, who has 34 international caps to his name, insists he would love to pull on the Three Lions jersey again telling Hammers' fans on Thursday that he would be delighted to answer any future call-ups.

'Realistically, I'm not sure I'll get picked but if I am I'd love to play.'

Downing, meanwhile, revealed West Ham's 2016 move to the Olympic Stadium played a huge part in his £5million switch from Anfield last summer.

'It's a big part of why I came here,' said Downing, who also confessed to enjoying the East End's favourite dish pie and mash.

'If we keep going the way we're going we'll head there in a good position.'
