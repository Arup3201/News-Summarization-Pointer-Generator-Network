Payton Manning closes in on Brett Favre after throwing his 500th touchdown pass during the Broncos' rout of the Cardinals

The best part of Peyton Manning's big day was getting to share the spotlight with some of his best friends.

Manning joined Brett Favre in the NFL's most exclusive of clubs with his 500th touchdown toss on Sunday when the Denver Broncos handed the Arizona Cardinals their first loss, 41-20.

The Broncos star has now thrown 503 touchdown passes, five short of Brett Favre's record of 508 

'Football is the ultimate team game, and so I guess one man has to accept it and I really accept it on behalf of a lot of coaches and teammates,' Manning said.

Manning threw for 479 yards and four TDs, moving him within five of Favre's record 508.

After getting his milestone touchdown — a 7-yard dart to tight end Julius Thomas — out of the way early, Manning helped Demaryius Thomas and Wes Welker make history, too.

Demaryius Thomas set a franchise record with 226 yards on eight catches, beating Shannon Sharpe's mark of 214 yards set against Kansas City in 2002.

Welker's seven receptions moved him past Rod Smith for the most catches in NFL history by an undrafted player. He has 854, five more than Smith caught for Denver between 1995-2006.

'I still can't believe he was undrafted because that man can play some ball,' Demaryius Thomas said.

Welker's record-breaker came on the last play on the first half, something Manning called 'kind of a ha-ha moment for scouting, for not drafting him. So, whoever was a general manager in 2004, those guys ought to send him an apology letter.'

Demaryius Thomas caught touchdown passes of 31 and 86 yards, and his 77-yard TD was nullified on a chop block by Julius Thomas that sent defensive end Calais Campbell from the game with a right knee injury.

Left tackle Ryan Clady was engaged with Campbell and was whistled for the flag. But it was the Pro Bowl tight end who crashed low into Campbell and drew the wrath of Arizona coach Bruce Arians.

'I've been coaching for 37 years, it's the dirtiest play I've seen,' Arians fumed. 'It was a flat chop block and put him out of the game. I know John Fox, great coach and great guy. Somebody has got to answer to that. A fine isn't going to do it, when he's going to miss three or four weeks, on a blatant chop block.'

Campbell's strained MCL added to a miserable afternoon in which the Cardinals (3-1) surrendered 568 yards, the most they've allowed since 1973, and saw fill-in quarterback Drew Stanton leave with a concussion.

The Broncos' offensive output was their best in franchise history. They had 567 yards against Atlanta in 2004.

Manning's 500th TD throw came in his 244th career regular season game, 49 fewer games than it took Favre. It came against two of his mentors: Arians, who was his first QB coach in 1998, and Cardinals assistant head coach Tom Moore, who was his offensive coordinator during his 13 seasons in Indy.

Patriots 43-17 Bengals

Tom Brady and the Patriots routed the Bengals and quieted the doubters.

The three-time Super Bowl winner finally looked like a quarterback who has thrown for 50,000 yards in his career as New England dominated the NFL's last unbeaten team, beating Cincinnati 43-17 Sunday night.

Just six days earlier, the Patriots lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 41-14, unleashing criticism that Brady had regressed and lacked talented teammates to help him.

"It's hard to be oblivious to things. We all have TVs or the internet or the questions I get and the emails that I get from people that are concerned," Brady said after throwing for two touchdowns and no interceptions. "Nobody died or anything. It's just a loss and I think we've always done a great job putting losses behind us quickly."

Brady did it in 2003 when the Patriots lost the opener to Buffalo 31-0, then beat Philadelphia in the next game 31-10 and went on to their second Super Bowl win in three years.

Sunday's win had special significance for Brady, as he became the sixth quarterback to pass the 50,000-yard mark.

"It's awesome," he said.

Brady threw for a 292 yards after not passing for more than 249 in his first four games, and Stevan Ridley had 113 of the team's 220 yards rushing against a team that had allowed an NFL-low 11 points per game.

The Patriots (3-2) surpassed that by scoring on their first two possessions on Ridley's 1-yard run and Brady's 17-yard pass to Tim Wright. They led 20-3 at halftime before the Bengals (3-1) cut it to 10 points on Andy Dalton's 37-yard pass to Mohamed Sanu.

Bills 17-14 Lions

Bills kicker Dan Carpenter responded to an alleged laser pointer shining from the stands in Detroit with laser-point accuracy.

After banking a 50-yard attempt off the left upright in the third quarter, Carpenter split the goal posts from 58 yards with 4 seconds left for a 17-14 come-from-behind victory over the Lions on Sunday.

"I hit it really good. It was one of those things I really like to not leave opportunities like that short," said Carpenter. "I hit the ball really well, a lot better than I did on the 50-yarder."

And this time, there wasn't a laser shining in holder Colton Schmidt's face, as apparently happened on the earlier miss.

The Bills filed a complaint with NFL security officials after both Schmidt and quarterback Kyle Orton said that someone in the stands was shining a laser pointer at them.

Without going into detail, coach Doug Marrone said the issue was resolved before the game ended. In fact, Marrone said, the laser was less of a distraction than it was a motivator.

"We felt that Dan could do it," Marrone said. "At that point, with the adrenaline and everything, he was fired up."

NFL spokesman Michael Signora said the league was waiting for its security representative in Detroit to file a game report. The Lions said in a statement that they were aware of the reports and contacted NFL security regarding the issue.

The Bills (3-2) snapped a two-game skid in Orton's debut as Buffalo's starter after EJ Manuel was benched this week. And their defense had six sacks in delivering coordinator Jim Schwartz a win in his return to Detroit after being fired as Lions head coach last season.

The Lions were undone by placekicking. Alex Henery missed all three field goals attempts, including a 50-yarder that sailed wide left with 21 seconds remaining.

Coach Jim Caldwell was already hinting of being ready to make another switch at kicker two weeks after Henery was signed to replace rookie Nate Freese.

"It's a performance-based league, plain and simple, and you have to perform," Caldwell said. "Anyone that doesn't, we take a look and see if we can improve that one way or another."

The Lions (3-2) squandered a 14-0 lead, dropped to 2-1 at home and also lost several key regulars to injury.

Receiver Calvin Johnson did not return after aggravating a right ankle injury in the first minute of the third quarter. Starting running back Reggie Bush didn't finish the game after also hurting his ankle.
