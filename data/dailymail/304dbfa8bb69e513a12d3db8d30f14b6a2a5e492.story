Gunners hit for SIX on Wenger's 1,000th game as Gibbs is mistakenly sent off after Oxlade-Chamberlain's handball

Even after schoolyard squabbles about Christmas cards, telescopes and specialists in failure, nothing could have stung Arsene Wenger quite like that 6-0 defeat at Chelsea.

The fact that it came in his 1,000th Arsenal game when the pre-match clamour had all been about an incredible milestone only amplified the insult. ‘Not a bad day, a horrendous day,’ said Wenger on Friday, as memories were rekindled against his will. ‘It was a massive disappointment; the lowest point of the season. We never forget that day.’

Arsenal are back at Stamford Bridge on Sunday when the Barclays Premier League’s unbeaten teams collide and Cesc Fabregas appears in blue against the club he left three years ago to join Barcelona.

Jose Mourinho has lost just three of his 32 Premier League games against Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal

The Cesc factor is the latest thread to a rivalry which has crackled with animosity since the day Jose Mourinho arrived in London and made it his personal mission to undermine the ‘Invincibles’.

Within a year, he had seized the title as a storm raged around their contrasting footballing ideologies and economic differences of their clubs, peppered with childish insults, snubbed handshakes and unacknowledged Christmas greetings. ‘When you give stupid people success if makes them more stupid,’ tutted Wenger.

The feud was quickly revived when Mourinho returned to the Premier League after a six-year absence and branded Wenger a ‘specialist in failure’ because of nine years without a trophy.

‘It was a consequence of something else,’ said Mourinho, who made the comment in reaction to an inference from Wenger that the Chelsea boss was afraid to declare his team in last season’s title race because he was afraid to fail.

 ‘I didn’t get an apology. I don’t apologise,’ he added. ‘My feeling is to get over it and move forward.

‘You don’t need to apologise. Intelligent people don’t need that. Let’s go to another match with big responsibility for both of us. We manage two big clubs in London and we have a responsibility not to win but to give a good match for the fans.’ 

Wenger celebrated his 18-year anniversary at Arsenal earlier this week with a win against Galatasaray 

He described his relationship with Wenger as ‘correct’ and ‘normal’ and offered his congratulations on his 18 years Arsenal, after the anniversary on Wednesday. ‘An amazing achievement,’ said Mourinho. 

‘Congratulations to him and the club. It’s not possible because he’s a manager of quality, but it’s a philosophy of the club.’

These two managers seldom pass a compliment to one another without darkening its edge. It is as if they spit on their palms before shaking hands or apply a ‘Kick me’ sticker with a slap on the shoulder.

On Fabregas, Mourinho teased about him coming ‘home’ and his ‘love’ for the ‘blue village’. 

How Arsenal fans react at the Bridge would be up to them, he said, but noted how Chelsea’s travelling fans had applauded Frank Lampard after he scored against them for Manchester City.

He dismissed the 6-0 win as ‘once in a lifetime’ and hailed Wenger’s unbeaten season in 2003-04 as something never to be repeated. 

‘I don’t see in modern football with the competitiveness of the Premier League a team being champions without defeat,’ said the Chelsea boss. ‘In my opinion that will stay in history as the last time.’ 

Mourinho has the upper hand over Wenger - the latter is yet to win in their 11 previous head-to-heads

From north London came similar noises of forced admiration from Wenger, now armed with another FA Cup win but the fact he has never beaten Mourinho must stick in the craw when they meet.

‘They had fantastic teams,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘Their defence, led by John Terry, Petr Cech and others, always have good defensive records. Let’s not forget Chelsea won the Champions League on good defensive stability.

‘This has nothing to do with individual confrontation. It is about team performance. I believe we have a good opportunity to change recent history that has been negative for us. In life you must always think you are there to change what happened before, or you are fatalistic.

Wenger admitted they had has 'never seen a player adapt as quickly' as Diego Costa (above)

On Wenger’s side is news that Didier Drogba, scourge of his teams on so many occasions during the last decade, is out with an ankle injury. Less encouraging, is confirmation that Diego Costa will start despite the problem with his hamstrings.

Costa has eight goals this season and Wenger dubbed him ‘a killer’ in front of goal. ‘I’ve never seen a player adapt as quickly,’ he admitted, although he has Danny Welbeck fresh from a hat-trick in Europe.

It will be decided on the pitch but their professional rivalry will bristle again on the touchline. Just as it did in March, when Wenger watched the horror of his 1,000th game unfold and Mourinho celebrated Chelsea’s sixth goal like a vandal spray-painting his own message on the milestone.
