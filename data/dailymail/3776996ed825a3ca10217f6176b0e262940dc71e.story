The girlfriend of late Baker Street singer Gerry Rafferty has been landed with a £75,000 legal bill after she lost a court battle with his family over his collection of valuable guitars and artwork.

Enza Fuschini, 58, of Dorset, claimed that Rafferty had given her three of his favourite guitars and that some of his other property was jointly owned by her.

But she was left out of the musician's £1.2million will, and today a High Court judge decided that the items - which also included a piano, antique furniture and a Mercedes car - should remain with his family.

The case had been taken to court to by the will's executors - Rafferty's daughter Martha, of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, and Russell Roberts, a lawyer and friend of the musician.

The items will go to Rafferty's granddaughter, Celia. Ms Fuschini, who was not in court for the hearing, was ordered to pay legal costs.

Ms Fuschini, an Italian-born artist, met the singer, originally from Paisley, near Glasgow, at a restaurant in London's West End about two years before his death at 63 in January last year. 

They hit it off immediately and he moved to Upton, near Poole, to be near the mother-of-three, before the couple moved into a large rented house together nearby.

She said it was during the months 
before his death that Rafferty, who had struggled with an alcohol 
problem, made a series of gifts to her, as well as purchasing items for 
their joint use.

The items, which included three valuable guitars, a Steinway piano, electric keyboard, 13 Matisse lithographs, 22 Russian icons, antique furniture and a Mercedes car, were all kept at their rented home.

Ms Fuschini said the gifts of the guitars and piano were made orally and that Rafferty had been teaching her to play in the months before he died.

But Mr Roberts said that, after an admission to hospital, the songwriter had asked for some of the items to be returned.

He said that Rafferty, most famous for his 1978 hit Baker Street, had told him he had made no life-time gifts.

It was also notable, he argued, that Ms Fuschini only made her claims after his death and had initially said she owned 11 guitars, before revising that down to three.

A judge sitting at the High Court in London said there was no contemporaneous evidence of any of the alleged gifts having been made.

In her ruling, the judge said: 'At no time did the deceased mention that he had gifted any valuable items to the defendant.

'Most importantly, the defendant herself made no such claim until after the deceased’s death, even at a time when he was asking for return of assets.

'I order formal release to the claimants of the items, together with appropriate declarations as to ownership.

'It seems to me that the defendant must pay the costs of this action.'
