Brazil's win over Colombia was an ill-tempered affair and was notable for both teams trying to stop the other side’s No 10. 

Neymar and James Rodriguez were both targeted. You could see the teams almost using a ‘rotational fouling’ tactic.

Players would put in a tackle on the star man and then let somebody else make the next one. By taking it in turns, it becomes less obvious to the referee when players accumulate fouls.

Brazil's game against Colombia set the tournament record for fouls with 54, with Neymar and James Rodriguez coming in for rough treatment.

Neymar in particular was the victims of ‘rotational fouling’ - where players take it in turns to foul the opposition. It worked a treat too, none of the culprits were booked. 

And Colombia weren’t the only ones to target Neymar - Chile shared tackling duties over 90 minutes in their last 16 tie.

It’s not a common tactic, but it would not be unusual for teams to have that in their locker. 

With somebody like Neymar, it becomes easier to get away with cumulative fouls because he pops up all over the pitch. A defender can be more physical, knowing it’s unlikely that they will come into contact with Neymar again soon. 

In that quarter-final the referee seemed to have left his cards at home. Because of that leniency, we have been denied the chance to watch the brilliance of Neymar.

Rodriguez came in for similar treatment and took more evasive action than Neymar, who looked to stay on his feet. I wondered how long it would take for Fernandinho to get booked, but the card never came. Instead it was Rodriguez himself who was cautioned after just one foul.

Referees have a duty to protect players. They seem to be more lenient in this tournament and so it has become possible to stop the stars with clever tactical fouling.
