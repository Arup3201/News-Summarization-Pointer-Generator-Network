A man was arrested after calling police on three occasions to complain that he had been overcharged for a can of beer - by a penny.

Danny Smith, 51, of Tennessee, United States, called 911 after buying a can of Heineken in Memphis.

Officers said he told them 'the store clerk over charged him and owed him 1 cent in change', according to a criminal complaint.

He was arrested on Monday following the incident, according to Smoking Gun.

Smith was told he should not dial 911 in non-life threatening situations, and that the alleged overcharge was a civil matter.

He called back a second time minutes later only to be told this again.

Smith said he had called them because he believed police were 'not helping him get his penny back from the business'.

He then called the police a third time on the non-emergency number and asked for assistance.

But officers were already at the 
Night and Day Food Market in Memphis in response to his second call and 
arrested him for misuse of the system.

Smith was booked into Shelby County jail on a misdemeanor charge and released yesterday after posting $250 bond.
