An earthquake hit the Channel island of Jersey yesterday.

A tremor initially thought to have been 2.9 on the Richter scale woke residents at 1.37am.

Its epicentre was around 2km east of the isle’s capital of St Helier and was recorded by the British Geological Survey.

There have been no reports of damage from the earthquake which was felt around the island.

An earthquake rumbled through the town of St Helier on Jersey, waking residents up in the dead of the night

One resident said there was ‘a very large bang’ and he felt the side of the house shaking.

Another resident, Viv Petit, tweeted: ‘Felt it, thought might have been an explosion in St Helier. Rumbling noise, doors shook.’

There are around 200 to 300 earthquakes in Britain every year, but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them.

Between 20 are 30 are over 2.0 magnitude which can be felt over a wider area.

John Searson of the Jersey Meteorological Department said that an earthquake in Brittany in November and felt on the island had measured just over 4 on the Richter Scale.

It was possible that yesterday’s quake was the earth settling after that, he added.

Between 200-300 earthquakes occur in the UK every year though the vast majority are too slight to notice

UK earthquakes, particularly in Scotland, are most often attributed to glacial rebound.

Until about 10, 500 years ago much of the north of the UK was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle.

These rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted, causing occasional earthquakes in the process.

The UK is also subject to tectonic stresses caused by the expansion of the Atlantic Ocean, which is slowly pushing the entire of Eurasia to the east, and from the northward motion of Africa, which is pushing into Europe from the south.
