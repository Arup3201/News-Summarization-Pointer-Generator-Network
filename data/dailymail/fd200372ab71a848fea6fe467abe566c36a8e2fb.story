The Democratic National Committee announced on Thursday that it had selected Philadelphia as the site of its 2016 presidential nominating convention - a snub to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had aggressively lobbied the organization to have the gathering in Brooklyn.

In a statement explaining the decision DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz specifically cited the City of Brotherly Love's 'commitment to a seamless and safe convention' and its 'deep rooted place in American history' as the reason the Pennsylvania metropolitan was chosen. 

The DNC had previously said the convention would take place the week of July 25, a month earlier than in the past, following the a Republican Party arrangement to have its convention the week prior in Cleveland, Ohio.

Democrats have selected Philadelphia as the site of the party's 2016 national convention, choosing a patriotic backdrop for the nomination of its next presidential candidate. The convention will be held the week of July 25, 2016, a week after Republicans fete their nominee in Cleveland, Ohio

Also on the losing end of the deal was Columbus, Ohio, a third site under consideration for the large-scale event.  

Philadelphia has hosted eight presidential nominating conventions, most recently in 2000 when Republicans formally picked George W. Bush as their nominee.

New York City has also served as the backdrop for national party gatherings and was the location in 1992 in which Bill Clinton received his party's stamp of approval.

Hoping to make history again, especially if Clinton's wife, Hillary, a former New York Senator is named the Democratic candidate for president, de Blasio had pushed the DNC party hard to have its conference in the Big Apple. 

The NYC Mayor has close ties to the Clintons and served as Hillary's campaign manager during her Senate bid in 2000.

But Brooklyn, where de Blasio wanted to hold the event at the recently opened Barclays Center, is so far untested for an event of this size. 

And, the borough featured just 3,500 hotel rooms. Convention planners were looking for a location with roughly 17,000 rooms nearby. 

Had NYC been selected, most convention goers would have had to commute from Manhattan, clogging up the public transit system for the extremely populated city's residents.

On a website making the case for why it should host Democrats' 2016 gathering, the city of Philadelphia said it could offer 16,726 rooms in close range.

New York City also had less cash on hand to put toward the convention, though it boasted more commitments, than Philadelphia. 

At the end of January de Blasio said his planning committee had $6.5 million and a total of $20 million pledges. Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a former Philadelphia mayor, said he had $8.6 million cash on hand and $14 million promised. In 2000, the city ultimately brought in $63.7 million.

Aside from logistical problems of the convention, de Blasio's rocky relationship with his city's police force was said to be a concern for Democratic Party officials. 

A source familiar with the situation told the New York Daily News committee members were 'worried about the optics' and that in selecting NYC as the host city the spotlight would be taken off the party's presidential nominee and put on de Blasio and the police.

'The way the mayor has handled the tensions in the city has raised the hurdle for New York City being chosen as the convention site. ... In all probability, it's a death knell for the city's chances,' a Democratic operative told the publication at the end of last year.

The NYC mayor is not well liked by certain law enforcement division in his city who allege that his behavior following the death of Brooklyn man Eric Garner at the hands of police and grand jury hearing of an involved officer helped incite violence toward cops there.

A group of police turned their backs on him at a funeral honoring two fallen officers killed in the name of Garner when de Blasio spoke, and distrust between the mayor's office and members of the police force remains high.

With the tagline 'Because it all started here,' Philadelphia had touted its history as the first Capitol City in the nation and the site of the signing of the Declaration of Independence as reasons it should be selected. 

It also played up its 'strong minority business community,' '130+' local labor unions and ability to provide adequate security for attendees of the gathering.

Celebrating his city's good news today, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in a statement, 'We believe that it was our proven track record of hosting big events safely and efficiently' in addition to the city's 'tremendous amenities, its accessible location and historical significance, which made Philadelphia the ideal choice for the 2016 DNC.'
