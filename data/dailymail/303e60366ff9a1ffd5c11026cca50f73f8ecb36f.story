Horror: Six-year-old Erfan Ali after he was savaged by an out of control dog

The owner of a Rhodesian Ridgeback called Tyson is facing jail after the dog savaged a six-year-old schoolboy.

Erfan Ali was scarred for life when the neighbour's pet jumped a four foot high wooden fence into his family's garden.

The Cardiff schoolboy was helping his mother, Monowara Ali, and sister Masudah, 12, bring the washing in when the dog landed and pounced on him.

Mrs Ali, 37, fled into the house with her son but was unable to stop the dog forcing its way into the kitchen and continuing the attack.

The six-year-old suffered deep cuts to both sides of his face and the attack continued until dog owner Kevin Large, 27, managed to drag the animal away.

Large, 27, from Gabalfa, Cardiff admitted failing to control the animal at Cardiff Crown Court and will be sentenced next month.

Erfan's dad, Dilwar, 38, said: 'The dog was really attacking my boy badly - it bit his right and left cheeks and his left hand has been damaged as well.

'There was blood everywhere.'

After the incident in September last 
year Erfan was taken to University Hospital, Cardiff and then 
transferred to a special unit in Swansea.

Mr Dilwar, a restaurant owner, said: 'The plastic surgeons took the decisions to operate as soon as possible.

Recovery: The six-years-old has needed plastic surgery to try and fix the scarring to his face.

'My son will be scarred on his face and will need future operations.

'The
 scars are not just physical - Erfan cries at night, he doesn’t want to 
sleep alone and he feels safer in school because there are big gates and
 other children around him.

'He is extremely scared of dogs and doesn’t trust any animals. I don’t want this to happen to other children.'

Since the attack the Ali family have moved to a new part of the city in a bid to put the incident behind them.  Speaking at the time of the attack Large said: 'I am just feeling really bad, I am just devastated over the situation.

'I climbed over the fence because I could hear screaming and I could see the dog in next door’s hallway.

'He was barking so I just quickly grabbed him. I didn’t know what had happened. I saw the little boy and the blood on his face.

ADMISSION: Kevin Large at Cardiff Crown Court

Dog: Rhodesian Ridgebacks are also known as African Lion Hounds

'You can imagine what I thought then - it was just panic.'

Tyson has been put down since the attack. The dog was a Rhodesian Ridgeback, a South African breed of dog known for its 
bravery.

They are also known as African Lion Hounds as they have been 
used to hunt lions, but are not banned in the UK.

Large who insisted Tyson had been 'a lovely dog' admitted the charge under the dangerous dogs act. The
 hearing was told Erfan’s parents will address to
 court during sentencing to describe the impact of the attack.

Judge Huw Davies released Large on bail but warned he could face custody. He told him: 'All options remain open'.
