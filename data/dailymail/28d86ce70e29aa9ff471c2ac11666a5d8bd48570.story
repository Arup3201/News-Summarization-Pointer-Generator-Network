Mourners are to be fined £147 if funerals go on longer than their allotted 40 minute time limit at a council-run crematorium.

North Devon Crematorium in Barnstaple will add the additional charge to the cost of a ceremony if the time between the hearse arriving and the last mourners' cars departing exceeds 40 minutes.

Devonshire funeral director David Williams says that the fine is 'not morally defensible', and has been added without warning.

Fine: North Devon Crematorium in Barnstaple will add the additional charge to the cost of a ceremony if the time between the hearse arriving and the last mourners' cars departing exceeds 40 minutes

He said: 'It is not nice - we were annoyed about it because it came through on our invoice.

'They had just snuck it on, no-one was ringing us up saying the service over-ran.

'And if the service is shorter than expected, the crematorium does not give money back to families.

'A funeral is not like a kids’ birthday party.

'People are distressed but they are just saying "You have 40 minutes, get in and get out", It’s not right.

Mr Williams added that funeral directors are losing money because they do not wish to impose the fines on customers.

He said: 'Funeral directors have been paying the charge rather than putting it on the bill, but it means our fees might have to be increased to cover it.

'It would be horrendous for us to put it on the bill. How can you justify that to the families?

'They have just paid £2,000 and then we give them an extra fee.'

Martin Williams, procurement and services delivery manager at North Devon Council which runs the crematorium, explained that funerals are booked in 40 minute slots.

Services should last 30 minutes, allowing an additional 10 minutes for mourners to come and go.

But he said that services can be extended by an additional 30 minutes if prearranged.

He said: 'It is the funeral director’s responsibility to assess the bereaved family’s needs and book the appropriate length of service accordingly.'

He added: 'All funeral directors were informed of these changes by letter before they were introduced.

So far the council has only received complaints from three funeral directors out of a total of 81 in the area, according to Mr Williams.
