An autopsy report has revealed that the death of Jimi Jamison, the lead singer of 1980s rock band Survivor, was partly caused by methamphetamine use.

Jamison died on September 1 aged 63 at a home in Memphis, Tennessee, according to the report released by the Shelby County medical on Tuesday.

It had originally been reported that Jamison – who sang on Survivor hits such as Burning Heart and Is This Love - died of a heart attack.

The autopsy says Jamison had cardiovascular disease and narrowing of the arteries.

The report says he died of a hemorrhagic brain stroke, with ‘acute methamphetamine intoxication contributing.’

Because meth was determined to be a contributor, and the circumstances leading up to the death were not suspicious, the coroner ruled Jamison's death as an accident.

The singer and songwriter joined Survivor in 1984, after the band had already become known for Eye of the Tiger, the theme song to the Sylvester Stallone film Rocky III.

After Jamison replaced vocalist Dave Bickler, the band had several more hits and recorded three more albums until they disbanded in 1989.

The group reformed in 1993 with Bickler as lead singer, but Jamison eventually rejoined Survivor also and they remained a popular touring act in recent years.

Jamison, who also was a member of Target and Cobra, also co-wrote and sang I'm Always Here, the theme to Baywatch.
