A jealous lover charged with murdering nursing student Michelle Le sent her progressively angrier and threatening text messages about her baby’s father, telling him that Miss Le ‘dug her own grave’ and ‘would not be around much longer.’

Giselle Esteban’s texts all stemmed from jealousy that Miss Le was having an affair with her ex-boyfriend, the prosecution said.

Transcripts presented in court Friday showed a chilling timeline in the months preceding Miss Le’s disappearance of the San Francisco student who was later found in a makeshift grave in a canyon.

Scott Marasigan, who has a child with Esteban, continually denied any affair with Miss Le, but never believed him, prosecutor Butch Ford told Mercury News.

He said Esteban became ‘so enraged that she began essentially to hunt down Michelle.’

Marasigan told the jury that he began saving Esteban’s crazed text messages to protect himself after he himself faced domestic violence charges earlier.

He said Esteban had taken a knife out and threatened to kill herself and their unborn child if he didn't leave Miss Le.

While Mr Marasigan testified that he did in fact date Miss Le several years ago, their relationship was never sexual in nature, and he said they were nothing more than friends.

Incriminating evidence: Esteban texted her baby's father telling him 'your wh*** will get what she deserves'

Esteban’s text messages – which began February 10 with the message ‘I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her’ - grew increasingly antagonistic throughout the months.

'I'm not sorry for the consequences your actions have brought on you both.. You have dug your own graves.'

She demanded that he cut her out of his life completely ‘for our family’s sake.

'It’s the only thing that will 
convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise, be prepared to be 
held accountable for your bad actions and decisions,' she wrote.

On
March 2, Esteban texted: ‘Michelle has dug her own grave by being a 
home wrecker and wh*** … She won’t be an issue for much longer.’

On May 29, two days after Miss Lu disappeared, she texted Mr Marasigan: ‘Where’s Michelle?’

Miss Le was reported missing in May after she failed to return from a break during her shift at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Centre in Hayward.

Her white Honda SUV was later seen driving out of the garage by video surveillance later that evening.

The vehicle was found abandoned a few blocks away and it was unclear whether the student was driving it or not.

Police believe an assault happened at the hospital’s car park as CCTV shows Esteban at the scene before and after Miss Le’s disappearance.

Detectives said they found traces of Miss Le’s blood inside her SUV, as well as on one of Esteban’s shoes during a search of Esteban’s home.

Esteban told KGO-TV at the time that she hated Miss Le because she was friends with the father of Esteban’s young daughter.

But Esteban insisted she had nothing to do with her disappearance.

Esteban’s ex-boyfriend, who had custody of their daughter, got a restraining order against her three days before Miss Le’s disappearance.

Friday's testimony didn’t go into the specifics surrounding Miss Le’s death, but evidence placed Esteban’s DNA on a stain on Miss Le’s steering wheel.

Miss Le’s DNA was found on a bloodstain on Esteban’s shoe.

Esteban is scheduled to be in court next on January 20, when she is to be arraigned.

February 10: 'I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her. I wish I had a kid with a better man.' February 17: 'Cut her out for our family's sake. It's the only thing that will convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise be prepared to be held accountable for your bad actions and decisions.' February 18: 'If you aren't sorry for anything you have done with that wh*** and are not willing to make things right for (our daughter's) sake, then no, I'm not sorry for the consequences your actions have brought on you both. ... You have dug your own graves.'February 25: 'FYI, you pushed me into insanity with you putting wh**** before your own family. You should have loved (their daughter) and I more, but you loved sex and attention more. Those two are exactly what you are going to get now. You reap what you sow.'February 26: 'And you can't protect anyone. Your wh*** will get what she deserves, too.' February 26: 'Get rid of your wh***. Block her out. Otherwise you bring your own hell on you and all you love.'February 28: 'I was loving and open and took care of you and Michelle, and you two lied to me, not once but three times. It's only fitting you pay for your mistake. So will she.'March 2: 'And Michelle has dug her own grave by being a homewrecker (sic) and a wh***. ... She won't be an issue for much longer.'March 17: 'FYI, she won't pass her midterms.'May 29: (two days after Le's disappearance): 'Where's Michelle?'
