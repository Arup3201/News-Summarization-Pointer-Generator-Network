If you're on a diet, look away now. There's a global obsession with fast food, which shows no signs of slowing down. 

With extra cheese, extra bacon and extra portions, these calorific dishes are among the most unhealthy in the world.

Femail investigates the top ten most heart-stopping, artery-squeezing burgers.

1. KFC's Double Down Dog is topped with cheese, honey mustard and relish dressing

1. Kentucky Fried Chicken caused a stir with the introduction of its heart-stopping Double Down Dog - a traditional hot dog that opts for a not so traditional fillet of fried chicken rather than a bun. 

The 'Dog' is then smothered in cheese sauce, honey mustard and relish dressing. 

AVAILABILITY: It was only available over a two-day period in the Philippines.

CALORIE CONTENT: 540 calories

2. Burger King's X-tra Long Chili Cheese Burger is compiled of three flame-grilled beef patties, cheddar cheese and chili cheese sauce

2. Burger King is offering up not one, not two, but three beef patties in Burger King's X-Tra Long Chili Cheese burger.

The sub is then topped up with cheddar cheese slices, chili cheese sauce and fiery jalapenos.

Let's not forget, the 'X-tra' is extra indeed; the sandwich is supposedly 17.5cm in length, which is 4.8cm longer than the chain's largest burger.

AVAILABILITY: Germany and Austria.

CALORIE CONTENT: 808 calories.

3. Burger King's fondue burger is composed of cheddar, mozzarella, Parmesan, Emmental, Gouda and even a splash of white wine

The fondue sauce comes by itself, or with the Beef Fondue Burger (right) or the Chicken Fondue Burger (left)

3. Forget ketchup or mayonnaise, Burger King's Fondue Burger is definitely one of the more bizarre burger concoctions, combining an American favourite with the French delicacy.

The sauce supposedly includes cheddar, mozzarella, Parmesan, Emmental, Gouda and even a splash of white wine.

It's available by itself or with the Burger King beef or chicken burger.

AVAILABILITY: Japan

CALORIE CONTENT: 782 calories.

4. McDonald's McGrillschnagg includes a layer of bacon with grilled pork sausage curled on top, topped with cheese,  all resting on top of a rösti - the Swiss version of hash browns.

4. Just as terrifying as it sounds, McDonald's McGrillschnägg has a double meat combo of a sausage made from 100 per cent pork, laid on top of strips of crispy bacon. 

All of this is nestled on top of a rösti - the Swiss version of hash browns - and topped up with grilled onions and a spicy mustard sauce.

AVAILABILITY: Switzerland

5. KFC'S Zinger Double Down King is comprised of a beef patty, bacon, cheese sauce and barbecue sauce sandwiched between two slabs of fried chicken

'No bun, all meat': The advertising slogan of KFC's Zinger Double Down King says it all, as the sandwich forgoes any sort of bread bun

5. A variation on KFC's aforementioned Double Down Dog is its South Korean burger cousin, the Zinger Double Down King. 

In a similar manner to the 'Dog', the bun is omitted in place of two fried chicken patties.

Thrown in for good measure with the beef patty is  cheese, bacon, barbecue sauce and the Colonel's 'special sauce'

AVAILABILITY: South Korea.

CALORIE CONTENT: 750 calories.

6. Burger King's Whopper Poutine offers up French fries, gravy, cheese curds, chopped beef, mustard, ketchup and pickles

As the advertising headline indicates, Burger King's Whopper Poutine is only available in Canada.

6. Not quite a burger, but bosses at fast-food chain Burger King have certainly outdone themselves with their Whopper Poutine.

A 'poutine' is traditionally a Canadian dish composed of french fries, gravy and cheese curds. 

Burger King's 'Whopper' offers the dense additions of chopped beef, mustard, ketchup and pickles.

The fast food chain also serves up less monstrous versions of the 'Whopper' such as the Classic Poutine, Poutine with Bacon and the Angry Poutine with jalapeños and onions. 

AVAILABILITY: Canada.

CALORIE CONTENT: 880 calories... and 1490mg of sodium and 70mg of cholesterol.

7. McDonald's Mashed Potato Beef Burger has layers of lettuce, bacon, two beef patties and a seasoned mash potato dolloped on top

7. Definitely the strangest of them all, is McDonald's Mashed Potato Beef Burger.

The concoction includes salad, two '100 per cent beef' patties, bacon, laden with a seasoned mash potato topping - all sandwiched between two buns.

Even more surprising is the staggering low price for the hulk of food: RMB19.5 which tallies up at about £2.11.

AVAILABILITY: China.

8. Applebee's Quesadilla Burger is filled with bacon, cheese, 'Mexi-ranch sauce', salsa and lettuce

8. The American restaurant chain Applebee's has served up quite the beastly hybrid with their signature Quesadilla Burger. 

A stacked bacon cheeseburger with 'Mexi-ranch sauce', salsa and shredded lettuce.

AVAILABILITY: America.

CALORIE CONTENT: 1,430 calories.

9. McDonald's Mega Tamago is a variation on the Double Big Mac, where one of the beef patties are substituted for egg and layers of bacon are thrown in for good measure

9. If the name of a burger has the word 'mega' in it, it's probably indicative of the proportions... which are terrifyingly huge in McDonald's Mega Tamago.

Three whole beef patties, a layer of egg, a layer of bacon, cheese slices, lettuce and an array of McDonald's sauces - all impossibly stacked between two buns.

AVAILABILITY: Japan.

CALORIE CONTENT: More than 1,000 calories.

10. Hungry Horse's Double Donut Burger contains two thick beef patties topped with slices of melted cheese, four bacon rashers and barbecue sauce, sandwiched between two glazed ring donuts

10. Call the doctor! The final calorific offering on the list is a sweet-meets-savoury beast from Hungry Horse - a chain of pub-restaurants.

Two large hunks of beef, separated with melted cheese slices, add in four strips of bacon, smother the whole thing with barbecue sauce and then cram the lot between two glazed ring donuts. 

AVAILABILITY: England, Wales and Scotland
