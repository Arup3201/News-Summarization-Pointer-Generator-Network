Brighton medical student Hester Stewart, 21, died in 2009 after taking the then legal drug GBL.

Special legal high clinics have been set up in Brighton in a bid to tackle the rise in use of the substances.

Health and social care charity CRI - Crime Reduction Initiative - has opened the clinics, believed to be the first in the country, following the deaths of several young people.

Brighton medical student Hester Stewart, 21, died in 2009 after taking the then legal drug GBL.

Her mother Maryon Stewart has since set up the Angelus Foundation calling for more information about legal highs.

CRI says the new access points will offer 'a range of services from advice and information to a full assessment and access to structured treatment' to help people kick their addiction.

Michael Lawrence, who works at CRI, said: 'Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) otherwise known as "legal highs" or "club drugs" have changed the local drug scene hugely over the last year.

'The assumption people make is that because they are legal they must be safe, but that isn't the case.

'We hope that by setting up this new service we will encourage more people to seek advice prior to taking anything.'

The clinics are opened in partnership with the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and are open two evenings a week to access as many people as possible.

Mr Lawrence added: 'We have seen many
people come in shocked at the type of experience they have had with 
NPS, which has often lead them into risky situations, particularly if 
mixed with alcohol.

'Some have ended up in A&E or have been arrested.

Hester Stewart, 21, an outstanding medical student who dreamed of becoming a surgeon, was found dead by police after a party in 2009.

According to a friend, she had taken a liquid drug called GBL. At the time the drug was legal but it was banned in December 2009 following a spate of deaths.

At the time of Hester's death, her mother Maryon Stewart, a well-known nutritionist who promotes natural health remedies, said that she felt 'cheated, frustrated and angry' that the Home Office had not acted on their promise made the previous August to ban the drug.

Mrs Stewart has since set up the Angelus Foundation calling for more information about legal highs.  

'We just don't know enough about the long term effects of any of the "legal highs" but even the short term effects can be extremely dangerous.

'We'd advise people not to start using these untested substances at all, but to be fully informed if you do choose to take them.'

In August it was reported deaths involving legal highs increased by 80 per cent last year –  to one every week.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show fatalities relating to the psychoactive substances rose from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 – compared to 22 in 2010.

Drugs such as 'meow meow', 'Black Mamba' and 'Benzo Fury' were all legal when they were first produced, but have since been outlawed.

However, banning the substances has had no effect on the number of deaths they have caused, which increased from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Among legal highs, deaths involving a substance called cathinone tripled from six in 2011 to 18 in 2012.
