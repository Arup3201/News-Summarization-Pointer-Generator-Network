It has been an eyesore for the past two decades as mounds of rubbish continued to pile up outside this home in one of Australia's most sought after suburbs. 

But the dilapidated house just streets back from Sydney's Bondi Beach and estimated to be worth $2 million is now going under the hammer.

Rubbish has been a constant fixture at the property at 19 Boonara Ave over the years and the family who own it, dubbed the Bondi hoarders, have simply refused to clean up.

This residence in the beachside Sydney suburb of Bondi has been and eyesore for locals for at least two decades - but now it's going under the hammer after being listed for sale by a real estate firm

Rubbish has been a constant fixture at the property at 19 Boonara Ave over the years and the family who own it, dubbed the Bondi hoarders, have simply refused to clean up

The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets'.

The 550sqm block of land, which is within walking distance to the beach, 'offers plenty of scope to build you dream home (subject to council approval),' according to the real estate's advertisement.

The estimated rice range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data.  

The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard.

More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property.

The front gate and fence can barely contain the trash which fills the front yard and covers the front porch

With empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture piled high outside the home, it has not been lived in by its occupants for years. 

But the Bondi hoarders still inhabit the front and back yards of the Boonara Avenue house, guarding their piles of trash as if it is treasure. 

Plastic bags full of rubbish, old paint tins, a rusted wheelbarrow and a suitcase have caused the gates to almost burst at the seams as they hold back the mountains of trash.

One neighbour said people often come and go from the house but the residents are sometimes not seen there for days at a time

The property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home.

The council cleaned the property in mid-2014, but some neighbours said the house was as bad as they'd ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'.

Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity.

One neighbour described the Bobolas family as 'nocturnal' and said they found one of the women going through her rubbish

The street is one of the most expensive in Bondi, located just a kilometre from the iconic Bondi Beach

Plastic bags full of garbage, slabs of wood, what looks to be old carpet samples and cardboard boxes litter the front of the house
