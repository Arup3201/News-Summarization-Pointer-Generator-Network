Men in the South East topped the poll of those seeking the most impotency treatment, while Merseyside came bottom

The South East has been named the ‘Impotence Capital of England’, according to a new study.

Results showed that almost 20 per cent of those seeking treatment for the problem live in the South East of England, a higher percentage than any other region.

The area of the South East witht he highest count of men suffering impotence is Westminster. 

Experts have warned that there could be a rise in impotence due to men suffering from an increase in stress and anxiety – caused by long working hours, home pressures and the recession.

The South East was closely followed by 
the South Midlands, which accounted for 11.3 per cent of completed 
impotence consultations.

In third place was the West Midlands (9.3 per cent), with Yorkshire (7.9 per cent) in fourth place.

The
data suggest that the North of England is the most virile region with 
the North West (2.4 per cent) and Merseyside (1.8 per cent) coming 
bottom of the table.

Impotence is a common condition with studies showing that up to 33 per cent of men will suffer it at some point of their life.

The causes can be either physical or psychological, and in most circumstances can be easily treated by a health professional.

Experts believe that long hours, stress and the recession are to blame for more men seeking treatment

But with men taking on more roles in their day-to-day lives, many are finding that the extra pressures are having a direct impact on their sex lives.

Impotence is now more commonly known as erectile dysfunction (ED), or sometimes erection difficulties.

Men find they're unable to achieve or sustain an erection adequate for sexual intercourse.

Dr Hilary Jones, a medical adviser to the UK’s first online clinic, HealthExpress, who carried out the research, said: 'The survey could reflect a regional reticence factor in men actually admitting erectile dysfunction and seeking help for it, however, impotence is a common issue and many GPs have seen an increased number of men coming to them for advice, as the stress of everyday life affects their erectile function.

'However, it is key to gain medical advice as in some cases it can be a sign of a more serious underlying health issues including diabetes and heart problems.

'Impotence is not something men should be embarrassed about and there a lot of treatments on the market, whether that be prescription drugs, therapy in the form of counselling or relaxation, and in rare cases, surgery.'
