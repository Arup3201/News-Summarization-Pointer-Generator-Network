Convicted: Lemar Loveless, 26, is one of four British Army soldiers convicted of attempting to smuggle guns and cocaine into the UK

Four German-based British Army soldiers have been convicted of attempting to smuggle weapons and drugs into the UK.

A 'well-planned' operation to bring five guns and cocaine worth Â£70,000 to Britain from mainland Europe was masterminded by a former member of an elite cavalry regiment, Woolwich Crown Court heard.

Police arrested Lemar Loveless, 26, less than a week after he the Queen's Royal Hussars along with former regimental colleague Trave Dyce, 22, as the pair drove BMWs to the UK with the guns and drugs.

Officers also found ammunition and silencers when they searched the cars.

Police confiscated Loveless and Dyce's phones and managed to find a link with an Italian seller in Germany and a buyer of the goods based in London.

Messages recovered from the phones found that the pair went to Amsterdam in Holland via Germany and collected the guns - two German Walther PPKs and three Italian converted pistols - and cocaine.

The goods were stored inside a ball of tape lined with curry powder in a bid to fool sniffer dogs.

Though the guns were army issue, they were bought from a German-based Italian contact.

Piecing together the puzzle, officers worked out that Romone Marshelleck, 24, was to receive the guns to pass on to members of the London criminal underworld.

Police raided his Tooting, south London home and found pictures of him on an iPad posing with guns and ammunition.

Duran Wright, 28, of the Royal Logistic Corps and Lance Laurent, 26, of the Queen's Royal Hussars, were also arrested after messages linked them to the operation.

Another two soldiers could also face questioning.

Caught: Trave Dyce, left, is to be sentenced for conspiracy to import firearms and Class A drugs, while civilian Romone Marshalleck, right, has been convicted of conspiracy to import firearms

Police have vowed to continue to investigate after managing to analyse 'secure' phones used by gangsters.

Detective Inspector Chris Jones of the Metropolitan Police's Trident Gang Crime Command, told The Independent that the weapons 'would inevitably have been used to commit acts of serious violence on the streets of London.'

The four soldiers were convicted of conspiracy to import Class A drugs and firearms while Marshelleck was convicted of conspiracy to import firearms.

They will be sentenced on Friday.
