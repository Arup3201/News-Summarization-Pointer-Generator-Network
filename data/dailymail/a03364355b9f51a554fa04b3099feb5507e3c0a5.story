A university student has been banned from an entire county and branded 'pure evil' after she launched a hate campaign against a man with learning difficulties.

Melissa Thomas, 21, threatened to kill 31-year-old David Parnell despite already being put under a restraining order after targeting him over the course of 11 months.

A court heard how she had previously falsely accused innocent Mr Parnell of assaulting her and then was said to have created a Facebook page in his name so she could post abusive messages to her own account - and pretend they came from him.

Melissa Thomas, pictured left, who launched an 11-month-long hate campaign against David Purnell, 31, pictured right, has admitted breaking a restraining order by going to his home and threatening to kill him

As a result of her lies, Mr Parnell was arrested four times, charged with common assault and wrongly spent a total of 30 hours in a police cell before police found evidence which backed up his denials.

Last March Thomas - a tourism student - was given a suspended prison term and banned from contacting Mr Parnell under the terms of a restraining order.

But just two months later she ignored the court order and turned up drunk on his doorstep making threats towards him and kicking at his front door.

When police came to arrest her Thomas shouted: 'That fat ugly Parnell, I’ll f****** stab him when I get out I will say he raped me'. She later added: 'I hope David Parnell drops dead.'

Thomas, from Eccles, yesterday admitted breaching the restraining order at Manchester Crown Court, but escaped jail again after saying she had a 'very tough' childhood.

She was also ordered to live in a hostel in Liverpool and was banned from entering Greater Manchester for 12 months. Her sentence of four months in prison suspended for two years will continue.

Lies: David Parnell, pictured left, has revealed how Thomas, pictured right, made his life a misery after she falsely accused him of a string of offences - leading to his arrest four separate times

After the case Mr Parnell said: 'It is an absolute disgrace that she has not been sent to prison. I’m in a living hell. When is it going to end? Melissa is pure evil and the last few months has been a nightmare. I don’t understand why she has been doing this.'

He said in recent months he had been the victim of mysterious, bogus and anonymous tip offs about his home in Eccles.

The RSPCA had been called to his home amid false reports a dog was being mistreated at the property. A large food delivery was ordered to the address and police were called to reports that there were offensive weapons at the home.

Detectives hunting a man wanted over the murder of a local barmaid also visited his home after a report came in the fugitive was hiding out in the property.

Mr Parnell’s friend Roy Townley said: 'This woman is a compulsive liar and a menace and she has made David’s life a misery for a very long time. It is so upsetting that she has not been sent to jail.

'We have had to put up with so much at her hands and there is no reason for it at all. She had made threats to David in the past and on that night I am certain that she came to David’s home to carry out those threats.

'He is now scared to go out. He just doesn’t leave the house anymore in case something happens. We are struggling to understand how she has possibly avoided jail.'

In court: Melissa Thomas admitted breaching her restraining order not to contact David Parnell at Manchester Crown Court, pictured, and has now been banned from entering Greater Manchester so she can no longer harass him

The court was told Thomas and the victim used to be friends but had fallen out in June when she was arrested and cautioned for damaging plant pots outside Mr Parnell’s home.

The following day Mr Parnell was arrested and bailed for common assault after wrongly being accused of hitting Thomas about the head.

She then made a series of bogus complaints to police between June and August, falsely claiming that he had breached his bail conditions by contacting her.

Mr Parnell was left feeling suicidal for fear of being falsely sent to prison suffered panic attacks and also became fearful of leaving the house amid fears he might be evicted. All allegations made against him by Thomas were later dropped.

She later pleaded guilty to four counts of perverting the course of justice. But in May, Mr Parnell called the police after she began hurling abuse yards from his front door.

Prosecuting Mr Jonathan Dickinson said: 'The defendant went outside Mr Parnell’s house shouting various insults at him. She had been drinking in Manchester and got drunk and was put into a taxi and sent home by friends.

'Her mother received a message to go and collect her but when the taxi arrived, Thomas was abusive and walked away. She spoke with a landlord, a friend of David Parnell and that she was on her way to stab him.

'She arrived outside Mr Parnell’s house and standing seven or eight metres away from his door said ‘come on you fat c***’. He looked out and saw the defendant staggering around and could tell that her speech was slurred and rang the police.

'He heard a bang on the front door which transpired it was her kicking at the front door. He waited for the police and when they arrived she had left, they searched the area and found her in the town centre shouting and screaming around.

'It was obvious to police that she was drunk.'

Thomas later claimed she couldn’t remember the incident due to her intake of drink and prescription drugs.

Her lawyer Martin Callery said: 'Melissa Thomas in her formative years endured a very tough time and it is very much to her credit that she managed to obtain a place at university.'

But Judge Robert Atherton said: 'This behaviour is not going to be tolerated whatever your background. Other people are entitled to lead their lives. This man no longer sleeps at night.'
