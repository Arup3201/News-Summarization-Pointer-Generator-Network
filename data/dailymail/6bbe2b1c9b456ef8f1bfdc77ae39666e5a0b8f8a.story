Killed: Mark De Salis was shot dead in Libya. His family say they are 'devastated'

His family said: 'The 
family of Mark De Salis are shocked and devastated to hear about Mark’s 
death in Libya. Mark had been working in Tripoli in Libya for six 
years. 

'He worked for First Engineering and was currently working 
as a power manager bringing generators to Tripoli to provide 
electricity. Mark enjoyed his work in Tripoli and liked the Libyan 
people.

'Mark enjoyed travelling and had travelled extensively. He 
was a decent and incredibly loyal man and he was loved by many. He will 
be sadly missed by his family and friends.

'Mark was with a close friend from New Zealand who was also killed and our thoughts are with her family at this sad time.

'We would ask that our privacy is respected at this time.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We 
are aware of the tragic death of a Briton in Libya and we stand ready to
 provide consular assistance.'

The discovery comes less than a month after an American teacher was shot to death in the eastern city of Benghazi. 

A photograph which is claimed to be of the dead pair has been posted on Facebook.

The grim picture, which was taken at night, shows both the of the dead lying face down on sand.

Near them is what appears to be a picnic blanket with their belongings spread out on it, alongside a backpack. 

Their belongings were not stolen and the motive for their killing was unclear, he said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.

In London, a Foreign Office 
spokeswoman earlier said that diplomats were aware of reports that the bodies of
 two foreign nationals had been found in Libya 'and are urgently seeking
 further information from the authorities.'

She spoke on condition of anonymity in line with official policy.

A
 New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman told 
Reuters: 'We are working with the relevant authorities to confirm this.'

The killings come a month after a US 
teacher was shot dead in the eastern city of Benghazi, after which the 
Foreign Office said further attacks against Westerners were likely.

Nearly
 two years after the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi by rebels 
supported by British and French air strikes, the north African country 
has descended into a state of lawlessness as rival militias struggle for
 power and wealth.

The 
Foreign Office advises against all travel to most parts of Libya, 
including Benghazi, and against all but essential travel to coastal 
areas to the west and east, including Tripoli.

It warns of a 'high threat from terrorism including kidnapping' in the country.

Last
 month Libya was named as one of the countries posing an 'extreme risk' 
to human rights by UK-based risk analysis company Maplecroft in its 
annual Human Rights Risk Atlas.

Power vacuum: Rebels demanding greater local autonomy in Libya have sabotaged oil depots in the country, but have recently agreed to suspend their blockades

The death of the two foreign nationals comes after rebels agreed to end a two-month blockade of a key oil export terminal, prompting hopes of reviving the Libyan economy.

According to Reuters, Libya's central government hopes that it will resume oil production and export at one the country's largest oilfields, El Sharara.

The government had been expecting it to happen within three days after local militia agreed to suspend their two-month blockade. The rebels are demanding greater autonomy in the region.

'They agreed to lift the blockade,' a defense ministry spokesman said.

Tuareg tribesmen, who have held the some 350,000 barrels per day field hostage since October, have been demanding the creation of a local council and granting national identity cards for tribesmen.

Libya's main source of income, its oil sector, has been crippled following the power vacuum created after the civil war. Armed tribesmen seized key ports and oilfields across the country, cutting output to around 220,000 barrel per day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd in July.

Mellitah is near the town of Zuwarah and
 60 miles (100km) west of Tripoli. The area is home to a large oil and 
gas complex co-owned by Italian company ENI.

In other news, the Libyan military has detained two American basketball players in Benghazi, sources told Reuters.

The arrest reportedly took place at Benghazi University.

'They were arrested by university guards and then brought by special forces to the army barracks,' an army source said.

No further information was provided.

Last Friday, four American military personnel were released after several hours in custody.

According to reports, they were in Libya strengthening security at the US Embassy in Tripoli.

The four service members were reportedly reviewing potential evacuation routes for diplomats at the time they were detained.
