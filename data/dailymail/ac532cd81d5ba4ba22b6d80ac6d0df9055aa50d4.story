EastEnders star Kierston Wareing has branded the BBC soap 'boring' and her character 'one-dimensional' as she prepared to leave the show.

The actress, who only came on the show last Christmas, has been axed from her role as Kirsty Branning and is savaging the programme ahead of her exit.

The 37-year-old said she did not believe any of the storylines and that her character's behaviour around shotgun husband Max, played by Jake Wood, was ridiculous.

Sour grapes? Kierston Wareing has blasted the BBC soap, saying that her character became one-dimensional and that she did not believe in the storyline

'She was a wet drip by the end of it,,' she told the Daily Mirror. 'When I joined the show there were layers to it – "Is she nice? Is she not nice?".

'I had all these ideas. I wanted it to be really gritty but no one wanted to do anything like that.'

Ms Wareing said she was happy to be written out as she would not have left a safe acting job had they kept her on the show.

She added that the initial shock of celebrity that followed after joining EastEnders left her in tears.

Hard to believe: Kierston said she did not understand why her EastEnders character chased after onscreen hubby Max Branning, played by Jake Wood

'There were horrendous comments and I think I was trending on Twitter. I got a lot of negativity and I took it quite personally without a doubt.'

Earlier this week it was revealed that Ms Wareing suffered a miscarriage at four months while on set for the show.

She told OK! Magazine: 'It's been hard, especially at four 
months when you've got the baby scan picture and everything's fine. 
EastEnders were very supportive during that time.

'They were worried when
they told me they wanted me to do a fake pregnancy and I said, "Don't 
worry, it's totally different".

Asked
if she went through a grieving process on set after the miscarriage, 
Kierston said: 'I tried to separate work from my personal life.'

Secret heartache: Kierston Wareing has revealed she tragically suffered a miscarriage while on the set of EastEnders

Kierston
added that she had thought the pregnancy may have affected her job on 
EastEnders initially, as she was expecting when she first signed up to 
play Kirsty in the show.

She said: ‘It was supposed to be a year,
but I was pregnant when I started on EastEnders – I thought I was going
to lose the job. They said no I wasn’t, and I was going to do six 
months, then I had a miscarriage on set.’

Kierston stayed silent about the 
identity of the baby's father, however, saying: 'He's still around but I
don't really want to talk about it.'

The
actress went on to admit 
that she has struggled with the fame that being on the show has brought 
her.

Concern: Kierston, who plays Kirsty Branning in the BBC soap, revealed she thought she may have lost her job for being pregnant when she began

She said: 'It’s been really difficult – I didn’t realise people believe in these characters so much.

'When they meet me, girls say: "Oh God, you’re actually nice, my friend hates you." It’s hard not to take that personally.’

Kierston, who is leaving 
EastEnders after a new producer came on board and decided to shake up 
the cast, already has her next project lined up.

She will be starring in the epic new drama The Bible - which is rather a departure from her role on EastEnders.

The full interview appears in this week's OK! magazine

Opening
up about the part to OK! magazine, she said: ‘I play Delilah and I have
feelings for Samson but I’m told by the Philistines to betray him.

'Delilah
is devious, she’s seductive, she’s greedy. Elizabeth Hurley played her 
once so I’m flattered to think I am now. It’s been such a hit in the 
States.’

Discussing 
whether the religious aspect appealed to her at all, she said: ‘I went 
to a Catholic school and I’m wearing a cross that was blessed by a nun.

'I
believe in something but I don’t religiously follow the Catholic rules,
like no sex before marriage and no contraception. I’d like to look into
Buddhism and study a bit of that.’

During
Kierston’s time on 
EastEnders she has had a number of big storylines including pretending 
to be pregnant to keep Max, played by Jake Wood, interested in
their marriage.

At the time the actress admitted that she thought her character’s behaviour was 'embarrassing'.

She
said: 'I feel really embarrassed for her - imagine how the rest of the 
Square will react when it comes out that she lied? Mind you, Kirsty's 
got so much front, she might not care!'

The Bible is on Channel 5 from Saturday at 9pm, and will be out on Blu-ray and DVD on 26th November.
