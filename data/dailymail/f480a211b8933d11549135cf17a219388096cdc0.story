Vladimir Putin yesterday mocked the West's sanctions against Russia - as eastern Europe began boosting its defences amid fears of further Kremlin land grabs.

Putin dismissively brushed aside concerns raised by Washington, Brussels and London and inked Crimea's switch to rule by Moscow in defiance of international objections.

He also laughed off punishments imposed by the U.S. and EU on his closest friends and their banks.

Putin opened an account in blacklisted St Petersburg-based Rossiya Bank, which was singled out for sanctions by America, and ordered that his monthly £4,500 salary be paid into the bank.

'I have ordered the administrative department to transfer my salary there,' he said.

Vladamir Putin today said he would be transferring his salary to Russian Bank Rossiya Bank - despite the fact that the U.S. has said that it plans to sanction the organisation

The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, joined him. 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it,' he said.

And Putin joked in abusive slang that a gaggle of oligarchs including Yuriy Kovalchuk and Gennadiy Timchenko - seen by the U.S. as his 'cronies' and subjected to sanctions in support of Kiev - are 'typical moskali', bearing Ukrainian names.

But the Ukrainian premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday said he was signing an EU association deal - the first step to membership - to protect his country from 'armed gangster' Putin.

He insisted 'Russia has undermined the global security system.

'Russia has started to behave like an armed gangster in Europe, therefore we should find an adequate answer to stop an international crime because this is an international crime.'

In slashing a gas subsidy to Ukraine, he was using 'energy as a new nuclear weapon,' he said.

Poland responded by announcing that it will speed up the £3 billion purchase of a missile defence system, with Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz calling the turmoil in neighbouring Ukraine the 'biggest crisis' since escaping the Soviet noose 25 years ago.

France yesterday offered to send four fighter jets to the Baltic states and to ensure twice weekly AWACS patrols.

Yesterday 32 Crimean Tatars has requested refugee status in Poland following Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula.

Meanwhile, Ukraine was plunged into a corruption crisis amid claims that officials in the new government maybe complicit in an alleged £2.5 billion embezzlement scandal involving the Naftogaz state oil and gas company.

Naftogaz chief Yevgen Bakulin is suspected of heading a 'criminal group' whose members include other senior current and former Ukrainian government members.

Bakulin was detained last night after the corruption claims by Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.

Rossiya Bank has been blacklisted by the U.S. Visa and MasterCard have stopped servicing credit cards of customers using Russian banks affected by the economic sanctions announced in Washington.
