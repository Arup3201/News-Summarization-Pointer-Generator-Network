Mario Balotelli enjoyed his final summer holiday before getting back down to action with AC Milan. 

The 23-year-old striker, who celebrates his birthday tomorrow, soaked up the sun in Versilia in Tuscany, Italy. 

A topless Balotelli drew quite a crowd as he strolled through the small coastal town with an entourage of friends.

Smile for the camera: The striker and his entourage drew a crowd as passers-by stopped for pictures 

And his model fiancée Fanny Neguesha showed what's waiting for him when he returns home with a seriously racy Instagram picture that left little to the imagination. 

The Belgian model posted a mirror selfie where she's wearing just a skimpy black bikini set - predictably enough getting almost 23,000 likes from her delighted followers.

The couple got engaged just before this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

Balotelli top scored for Milan last season with 18 goals in all competitions. 

But it was a disappointing season overall for the seven-times European champions, finishing eighth in Serie A and missing out on European qualification altogether.

Club legend Filippo Inzaghi has taken over the reins in his first managerial post and Balotelli will be keen to ensure 2014-15 is more successful for the Rossoneri. 

In demand: Balotelli made the most of his time off being the start of the new season

The controversial forward has been linked with a move back to the Premier League this summer but warmed up for the new campaign with a brilliant free-kick as Milan beat Chivas Guadalajara 3-0 in a pre-season friendly last week.
