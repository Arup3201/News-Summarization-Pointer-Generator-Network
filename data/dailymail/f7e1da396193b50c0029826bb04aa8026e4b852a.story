Hot pursuit: Contender number one chases his rival down the tracks as the fight continues

Punches flew in their battle for dominance as they reared up onto their back legs.

The no-holds-barred fight shows the law of [urban] jungle being enforced.

No winner emerges, but one contender's kickboxing skills are a force to be reckoned with.

It is often said that New York has one rat per resident, totaling 8 million, but research published in 2014 claims that is not in fact the case.

However, the study did conclude that there are still 2 million of the rodents living in the city in analysis based on sightings on city lots.

Washington Heights, the East Village and Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, all in Manhattan, are identified as having large concentrations of rat-inhabited lots.

Rats that inhabit New York City are all the same species: Rattus norvegicus or the Norwegian rat, the same species as pet rats and laboratory rats.

They grow to approximately 16 inches in length and weigh a pound. A female rat produces 4–7 litters of around 10 rats each year.
