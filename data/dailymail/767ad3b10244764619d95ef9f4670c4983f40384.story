A 'high risk' convicted sex offender who has been accused of assaulting an 11-year-old boy at a synagogue has fled to Isarel. 

Former bar mitzvah tutor Yona Weinberg, 36, from Brooklyn, New York, who was convicted of molesting two 13-year-old boys in 2009, is said to have pushed the youngster against a shelf of prayer books in August.

The alleged altercation came two months after the same boy reportedly told police he had been force to touch Weinberg's shirt and pants. 

Police arrived at the home of the licensed social worker to arrest him - but discovered he had skipped the country when his wife said he wasn't there, according to the New York Daily News.

The licensed social worker is believed to be residing in Har Nof, a hillside community in Jerusalem (file picture). Residents there have been warned of the 'high risk' sex offender's presence 

However, as he has only been charged with a misdemeanor offence, prosecutors will not be able to have him extradited. 

Weinberg is a Level 3 sex offender and is required to check in with police every 90 days and verify his address. It is regarded as a felony if he fails to do so. 

In 2009 he was sentenced to 13 months in prison after he was convicted of molesting two 13-year-old boys.  

Child advocates in the Jewish Community are now furious he has managed to evade the charges and have accused District Attorney Kevin Thompson of taking too long to act.

Chaim Levin told the Daily News: 'He’s making all of us who really campaigned hard for him look like fools.

'He seems to be playing politics. The outcome of this case is disgusting.' 

Lupe Todd, Thompson's spokesman, told the paper: 'In the event that he returns to New York, he will be charged. 

Weinberg has reportedly been telling his neighbors in the scenic hillside community of Har Nof in Jerusalem that the accusations are a big mistake.

Child protection agency Magen, which is based in Israel, sent out a press release warning residents of his presence.

It read: 'Yona (Jason) Weinberg was convicted in June 2009 of 8 counts of sex crimes against two 13 year old boys and was sentenced and served up to 13 months in local prison. Weinberg is a registered sex offender under the New York State Sex Offender Registration Act. 

'Weinberg is assessed by the NY Criminal Justice Services as Risk Level 3, which is the highest level and means: “high risk of repeat offense and a threat to public safety exists”.

'Weinberg is reliably reported to have left the USA in recent months after further similar complaints were filed against him with NYPD.

'Weinberg, to the best of our knowledge, currently resides with his wife and family in Har Nof, Jerusalem. The Israeli authorities are aware of the situation.'

'The public is urged to be vigilant and take appropriate measures to protect and educate their children, calmly and in a manner appropriate to their age.

'Under no circumstances should members of the public take the law into their own hands.If you believe that a crime is being committed by a sex offender, contact your local law enforcement agency immediately as you would do in any case of suspected criminal activity.'
