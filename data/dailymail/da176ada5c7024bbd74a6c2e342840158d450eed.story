Snoopy, Indiana Jones and He-Man are just a few of the characters that have been turned into novelty cameras and showcased in a new book. 

Christopher D. Salyers has been collecting novelty cameras for more than a decade and along with friend Buzz Poole, he travels the world searching for some of the rarest models. 

Now, the pair, from New York, have released a coffee table book called 'Camera Crazy' which chronicles the history of novelty cameras.

The book explains the rise of photography from the launch of Kodak's Brownie, the world's first simple, low-cost camera, which made photography accessible to the masses in 1900 

Snapshots soon became the most popular method of capturing memories and soon the variety of cameras available increased.

The book celebrates the toy camera - once, quirky models marketed to children with cartoon characters which have since become niche collectors' items. 

These cameras, which offer soft focus and effects, became ubiquitous in the analogue age and remain popular today.

In essays studying the role of 'marketing and hipster culture' in the popularity of these cameras, the authors also discuss the surge of enthusiasm for their 'special effects' - paralleled by the rise of apps like Instagram, which mimic the effect of analogue cameras.

Their book also includes interviews with the inventor of the Holga camera and those responsible for Lomography. 

They explain Game Boy and Batman-themed cameras, as well as cameras specifically made to photograph cats.

Buzz, 37, said: 'Novelty cameras are hugely popular, in part because a lot of them are instant cameras and they produce a unique type of photos.

'But partly it's just because people love Mickey Mouse or Heineken beer and want to get their hands on all the merchandise they can.

'A lot aren't expensive at all and even the most collectible go for a couple of hundred dollars.'

Photographer J. K. Purnam said: 'Not only did I photograph hundreds of these cameras I also had the opportunity to shoot with them.

'For the most part these cameras shoot film, some shot formats that were tricky to get a hold of and have developed, but after a bit of trial and error and a few expired rolls I was able to get some pretty interesting shots.'
