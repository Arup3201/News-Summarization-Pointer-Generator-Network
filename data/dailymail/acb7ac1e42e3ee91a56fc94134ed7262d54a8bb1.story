Sotheby's intern: Alexander Mitchell, 26, drank enough alcohol to induce a coma before swimming into the Serpentine, an inquest heard

A Sotheby’s intern who drowned in the Serpentine screamed 'I'm not going to make it' after drinking enough alcohol to induce a coma and swimming into the lake, an inquest heard.

Graphics graduate Alexander Mitchell, 
26, had swam out into the middle of the lake in London's Hyde Park, 
before shouting out and disappearing under the water.

The inquest into his death heard how moments earlier he had been been seen doing 
press-ups and making noises at the birds before stripping to his 
underwear and diving into the water.

Mother-of-three Alexi Merahi was with her children rowing in the lake when she noticed Mr Mitchell in the middle of the water on April 6 this year.

'As he was swimming his mouth was a bit over the water and a bit under the water,' she told Westminster Coroner’s Court.

'But he was talking about a race.'

'I don’t know exactly what race. I thought two things - one, he wanted to race me, or in fact he was within a race and it was kind of a game and that is why he was actually swimming in the water. It wasn’t clear for me exactly what he meant.

'I said to my children he wants to have a race with us, but I carried on our way - he was still moving forwards at that stage, but then at that point he said ‘I don’t think I am going to make it. I am not going to make it.'

Ms Merahi told the hearing she had initially thought Mr Mitchell meant that he was not able to continue in whatever race he was talking about, but as she rowed away she saw him looking back towards the bank.

She added: 'He had no sign of distress at that stage, but it did trigger in my mind because at some point I turned around and asked him if he was okay.

'At that time he wasn’t responding because he put his head under the water once, he fixed his hair, then went back a second time so didn’t answer me at all at that time.

'But again I didn’t pick up any sign of distress at that stage - he was going under the water, coming back, fixing his hair.

'But the third time after he put his head under the water, he never came back.'

The court heard she then rowed back towards where she last saw Mr Mitchell but couldn’t find him.

However she noticed 'bubbles' appearing around her boat.

She said she was tempted to jump into the water after Mr Mitchell, but was warned by her 15-year-old son that it was 'too cold' and she wouldn’t be able to see anything.

Ms Merahi next desperately tried to raise the alarm, but said: 'Straight away I was looking for the whistle on my life jacket - I couldn’t find it.. So it went from one big frustration to another.'

Another onlooker, Javier Garcia Diaz De Guerenu, had jumped into the water in a rescue attempt, before the cold water became too much.

In a statement, he explained that Mr Mitchell had been 'acting strange' when he first saw him.

'He was doing press-ups and making noises towards the birds,' Mr De Guerenu said.

'He was not talking to them, but making noises.'

After a quarter of an hour doing this routine Mr Mitchell, who lived in west London, undressed and ran into the water, swimming for around seven minutes before disappearing, the court was told.

Mr De Guerenu said that when Mr Mitchell failed to resurface he dived in after him.

He added: 'The water was very cold. I could not see him, but continued to look.'

After a short time searching, the witness was so cold that he had to clamber into Ms Merahi’s boat and abandon the search.

Another witness, Lucy Brantly, was jogging along the lake and had initially taken pictures of Mr Mitchell before realising the gravity of the situation.

'I took my headphones out and then suddenly realised something bad had happened, and I freaked out,' she said.

Saying that it 'felt like ages' before emergency crews arrived, she added: 'There was a lot of fuss, but no one actually going in to try and get him.'

However, the court heard that emergency services had cordoned off the area and were looking for Mr Mitchell within about 10 minutes.

Mr Mitchell’s body was found by an underwater search officer, just before noon the following day, lying on his back in the silt at a depth of four metres.

He had started a three month art internship at auction house Southeby's just two months before his death, after graduating from Buckingham University with a BA in graphics.

Toxicology reports revealed that he had 279mg per 100ml of alcohol in his blood, at the higher end of the 200 to 300mg range that alcohol induced coma could occur.

A post mortem examination gave his cause of death as cerebral oedema, and drowning as a result of intoxication.

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said: 'The pathologist confirms that at the time Mr Mitchell went into the water he was heavily intoxicated - 279 milligrams is within the 200 to 300mg range that is associated with coma.

'He was heavily intoxicated. The effect of which would have been such that it will have affected his behaviour.'

Recording a conclusion of accidental death contributed to by intoxication, she added: 'Mr Mitchell’s death was tragic.

'He was a young man full of promise and hope, so much talent he wasted just with too much alcohol.'
