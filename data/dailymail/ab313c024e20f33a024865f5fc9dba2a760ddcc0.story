A scholar once wrote that Cambridge was ‘an asylum, in every sense of the word’.

But even he would have been shocked at the behaviour on display in the historic university city over the weekend.

Students stripped off, vomited, urinated in flower beds and drank themselves into oblivion after more than 2,000 descended on a public park.

Medical attention: A reveller was taken to hospital by ambulance after he drank himself unconscious at the park in Cambridge's city centre yesterday afternoon

Nature calls: Many of them were members of the college drinking societies and turned up wearing their university blazers- one undergraduate was seen weeing into the nearby flower bed

Public display: Some students were seen acting out sexual positions, while male students chanted and ran around with their trousers round their ankles

Parents with young children looked on 
appalled as some of Britain’s brightest minds took part in the annual 
Caesarian Sunday, a chaotic drink-fuelled party during which girls 
downed port from condoms and acted out sexual positions with male 
students.

One man in his 20s was taken away by 
ambulance after he collapsed.

The afternoon culminated in an organised 
fight between more than 20 male students from the Caesarians – Jesus 
College’s drinking society – and their counterparts from Girton, the 
Green Giants.

The undergraduates, many billed as 
the leaders and thinkers of tomorrow, created binge-drinking scenes 
which suggested David Cameron's declared war on 'booze Britain' still 
has a long way to go.

Booze trolley: Students transported as much alcohol as they could carry to the green

Passed out: A male lies on the grass, being helped by his friends. Caesarian Sunday is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer term, which ends with the notorious after-exams party, Suicide Sunday, in June

Fancy dress fun: The bad weather didn't stop students getting dressed up by painting their faces - although shocked onlookers later witnessed an organised fight between the Caesareans, Jesus’ inter-year drinking society and the Girton Green Giants, in which blood was shed as students chanted and cheered

Binge-drinking serves as a form of initiation, to Cambridge University's popular drinking societies.

Caesarean
Sunday is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer 
term. It historically takes place at a park in Cambridge’s city centre, on the first bank holiday of the summer term.

It is said to have started when a member of the Green Giants stole a bottle of Pimm’s from a Caesarean. The bottle was then thrown at the Caesarian in a challenge to fight.

Now, every year, the president of Girton’s drinking society downs a bottle of Pimm’s and invites the Jesus drinking society to fight.

CUTV.com bills it as 'an institution.'

Suicide Sunday

The party at Cambridge University is a traditional event in which hundreds of students celebrated finishing their exams.

Three years 
ago the Suicide Sunday garden party, organised by the Wyverns, an 
all-male Magdalene College drinking society, had to be held in a new 
location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned students 
from holding the event on university land.

The
controversial decision was made after a 23-year-old student was 
arrested the previous year during the infamous jelly wrestling contest 
for punching a spectator.

The name, is said to be a celebration that students haven't committed suicide due to exam stress - when it is held they are still unaware of their results.

VT valley rally

Its winter equivalent, the VT valley rally, occurs  during the annual Varsity ski trip, is quickly catching up to Suicide Sunday’s levels of debauchery.

Last year female students stripped to their underwear in front of hundreds of onlookers, while both men and women simulated sex acts with each other.

Wyverns drinking society

The Wyverns drinking society has a reputation for its hard partying and excessive drinking.

Its
initiation ceremony involves eating a 15-course meal with delicacies 
such as a pig’s snout with wasabi sauce and a pint of water with a 
goldfish swimming inside.

The
Caesareans society has a tradition whereby any initiated member can 
point at an invited male, or 'Legionary' as they call it, keeping with 
the Roman theme, and he must then down his drink.

There
is no limit to the number of times this can be done to any one 
individual, and it has been reported that many don’t make it much past 
the end of the meal.

The Ferret drinking society 

The Ferretz, an inter-collegiate drinking society, must consume 80 units on their initiatio. They usually start  with a bottle of gin and finish off with a bottle of port - consumed through a condom.

But not all initiations involve heavy drinking. Most female societies prefer to set the girls tasks, such as kissing strangers and dressing up, and asking strangers sex questions.

An ambulance was called just before 3pm after a student in his 20’s collapsed from drinking too much.

He was worked on for an hour by paramedics before being taken to nearby Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.

Police officers were also called to the park to assist with the incident.

Just
metres away a crowd of 200 people had gathered to hear a brass band 
play, but their afternoon’s entertainment was disrupted by the drunken 
students.

'I couldn’t 
believe what I was seeing, it was disgusting behaviour by students who 
are meant to be the cream of the crop,' said mum-of-two Tracy Burton, 
31, from Cambridge.

'We
had gone for a walk in the park with our children and there were lots 
of other families around and I’m furious they were exposed to their 
partying.

'Lots of the students were semi-naked, others were shouting, swearing and singing loudly.

'They were totally out of control and no one seemed to be stopping them.

'It totally ruined our afternoon and my four-year-old now says he doesn’t want to go back to the park.'

Cambridge University students take part in Caesarean Sunday every year to mark the start of the summer term.

This
year thousands of students shouted and cheered at around 3pm as more 
than 20 male students with 'war paint' on their faces viciously fought 
on the Green.

One team, wearing make-shift togas, marched behind a pig’s head on a stake as they headed to battle.

Many
then continued to drink all afternoon, before jumping in the nearby 
River Cam in their underwear or staggering to the nearby night clubs.

A lot of the students, both male and female, could barely stand by the end of the afternoon.

One girl was supported by her friends
as she hobbled home, while another had to be carried by a male friend 
as other students looked on giggling.

'This
is one of the biggest events in the calendar for the drinking societies
and some graduates even come back just for the occasion,' said one 
student, who did not want to be named.

'Many of them will start drinking at lunchtime and just carry on. A lot of them have been in the pubs for most of the day.

'The
initiations are really shocking and its worse as it’s in a public 
place, but most students are so drunk they don’t realise or care.

Legend has it that a member of the 
Girton Green Giants once stole a bottle of Pimms from a member of the 
Jesus college Caesareans.

The bottle was subsequently thrown at the group of Caesareans in a challenge to a fight.

Now
every year the president of Girton’s drinking society downs a bottle of
Pimms and invites the Jesus drinking society to fight.

'Most of them think they deserve to party hard as they work hard during the term.

'Exams are coming up and this is their way to let off a bit of steam before weeks of revision.'

Helping hand: Some of the students had more of their hands than they bargained for - these three men dragged their friend who has passed out across the green

Upside down: Girls were seen drinking port through condoms, while others
were held upside down as alcohol was poured in their mouths

Crowd: Just metres away a crowd of 200 people had gathered to hear a brass band play, but their afternoon's entertainment was disrupted by the drunken students

Dressed up: 'They were totally out of control and no one seemed to be stopping them,' said mum-of-two Tracy Burton, 31, from Cambridge

Moment out: Some students were so overwhelmed by the afternoon's activities they had to take a moment out on the grass

Headed for home: One girl's time was up when she was carried home, although her friends still looked in good spirits

One down: A girl was supported by her friends as she hobbled home

All together now: Students helped to push the ambulance out the mud - the patient was worked on for an hour by paramedics before being taken to nearby Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge
