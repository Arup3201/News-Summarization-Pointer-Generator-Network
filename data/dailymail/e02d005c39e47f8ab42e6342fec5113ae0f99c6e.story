The number of young women diagnosed with cervical cancer has soared in the last decade, as new figures reveal more than one million failed to attend smear tests last year. 

Over the last 10 years, cases of the disease in women aged 25 to 29 have soared by 59.2 per cent.

Meanwhile in the last year rates have risen 4.8 per cent, as one million women failed to attend smear test appointments.

Eight women in the UK are diagnosed each day and cervical cancer is the most common form of the disease in under 35s. 

A leading charity is today urging women to ensure they attend their regular smear tests, raising concerns that the uptake of screening has fallen to an all-time low. 

While some women admit they are too embarrassed to go for screening tests, others said they are concerned it will be painful, while some said they don't think the tests are necessary.

Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust has today launched the #SmearForSmear campaign to encourage more women to make sure they attend regular smear tests

The campaign, launched at the start of Cervical Cancer Prevention Week, comes as new figures reveal the number of women aged 25 to 35 with the disease has soared in the last decade, while one million women missed their smear test appointments last year

Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said in the last year 33.7 per cent of 25 to 29 year olds failed to have their scheduled smear test, while 22.3 per cent of 30 to 34 year olds missed their appointment.

Across the UK more than one in five of all women invited for screening fails to attend, with uptake falling below 78 per cent (77.8 per cent) for the first time in more than 20 years.

Among women aged 25 to 29 smear test uptake has fallen from 78 per cent in 1999 to 66.3 per cent last year.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics shows the number of women aged under 35 and diagnosed with the disease in England rose by 3.98 per cent in the last year, and 33.1 per cent over the last 10 years.  

To mark Cervical Cancer Prevention Week, this week, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust is urging the public to join their #SmearForSmear social media campaign.

Raising awareness of the importance of regular screening, the campaign encourages people to help stop the rise in the number of women diagnosed with the disease.

A survey by the charity found 20 per cent of young women believe cervical screening tests are unnecessary, while 26.2 per cent are put off having a smear over concerns it will be painful.

Meanwhile 26.6 per cent refuse the life-saving test, letting their embarrassment get the better of them.

The charity has also raised concerns over a lack of knowledge with more than half of young women unable to identify the cause of cervical cancer as the human papillomavirus (HPV).

One in 10 women believe smear tests detect sexually transmitted infections, while 13.5 per cent thought it was a test for ovarian cancer.

The charity's chief executive Robin Music, said screening remains the best preventative measure in combating the disease.

'Every day we see the devastating impact a cervical cancer diagnosis can have on both a woman and her loved ones,' he said.

'But to know that for those that delayed their screening before diagnosis, this could have been prevented, is tragic.

'It's now time that we see an upward shift in awareness of cervical cancer and an understanding of the importance of smear tests.' 

Professor Julietta Patnick, Director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, managed by Public Health England (PHE), said: 'It is evident that women in this younger age group still need encouragement to be screened and PHE is working hard to address this with research underway to investigate new ways of improving cervical screening uptake among younger women.

'Regular attendance at screening remains the top preventative measure against cervical cancer and we would encourage all women to make the decision to attend when invited.'

Mr Music added: 'We hope the public get fully behind this fun and simple campaign. 

'The more women who take this life saving five minute test, the fewer who will face infertility, early menopause, more extensive long term effects and potentially even loss of life.

'It's time we all acted as it may just save a life.'

The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years.

It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb).

A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment.

Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young. 

According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011.

The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good.

The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety.

Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland. In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year.

In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active.

Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.
