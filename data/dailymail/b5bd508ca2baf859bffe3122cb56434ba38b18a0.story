A police grenade was today blamed for the death of a young French eco-protester as fellow activists said Francois Hollande's government has blood on its hands.

Remi Fraisse, 21, died early on Sunday morning during a fight with riot officers as he campaigned against the building of the Sivens Dam in the south west Tarn region of France.

Seven police officers were injured after around 2,000 people gathered to protest, with some throwing Molotov Cocktails.

Prosecutor Claude Derens today said that Mr Fraisse died from a large wound at the top of his back caused by an explosion - and that more work was being done to establish weather a grenade was to blame

In a statement which implicated police in the death, prosecutor Claude Derens said: 'The big wound on the top of Remi Fraisse's back was caused, in all likelihood, by an explosion.'

He said there would be further action to determine whether 'a grenade, thrown from the area where police were entrenched, was at the origin of the explosion'.

Mr Hollande's former ecology minister Cecile Duflot said: 'For me it's an absolutely intolerable situation and an indelible stain on the action of this government.'

She said it was disgraceful that 'for 48 hours, no member of the government has expressed condolences, to say that it regretted what happened.'

MEP Jose Bove directly blamed Mr Hollande's increasingly authoritarian government saying: 'It's evident that the Interior Minister is responsible for the death of Remi Fraisse'.

Referring further to Bernard Cazeneuve, Mr Bove said: 'I accuse the Minister of the Interior of having put police officers in this zone to create tension.

'I ask him to explain. Is it that the government does something like this without saying anything. Bernard Cazeneuve doesn't know what's democratic.'

Demonstrations have been going on for weeks over plans to build the dam, which will destroy a nature reserve

In turn, Mr Cazeneuve accused political enemies of trying to undermine the government, saying: 'I see a lot of accusations even as criminal investigations are underway.

'Many comments this morning are part of a an attempt to politicise this drama.

'I have not heard much condemnation of violence from those who speak without knowing anything.'

Fraisse's body was discovered at two in the morning on Sunday, after Molotov cocktails were thrown at security forces.

There have been weeks of protest against the dam, which will destroy a biodiversity reservoir, despite ensuring irrigation.

As Fraisse's grieving family contemplated a manslaughter complaint against the police, Mr Hollande was contemplating further demonstrations against his government.
