Dr Tim Hands says parents being made to feel it is morally wrong to send children to private schools

Parents are being made to feel it is morally wrong to send their children to private school, according to a leading headteacher.

Dr Tim Hands, Master of Magdalen College School in Oxford, said there is a view that being privately educated is damaging to a child, and that 
youngsters are at risk of becoming social lepers.

He said: 'We
are asked to believe that our schools induce a new kind of social 
leprosy, with one politician recently arguing that attendance at an 
independent school was "seriously disabling".'

Dr Hands, who is this year’s chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), suggested it was 'illogical' that buying a house, car or holiday can be seen as acceptable but paying to educate a youngster privately is not.

He also warned that government education reforms over the last 50 years have put academic success over children’s happiness.

He said that in the last few decades people have become 'more bothered' about private education, and this has been fuelled by the attitudes of politicians.

'Making the journey to independent education, parents are currently made to feel, is an unacceptable mobility: expenditure on purchase of a car, holiday or house is moral; expenditure on the education of the child is not,' he said.

'The illogicality is clear. Why should those members of the public who so value education find that those responsible for publicly funded education do not value them?'

In a speech to the HMC’s annual meeting in central London, Dr Hands said in 2005 then Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke about how parents could transform their child’s education.

The headteacher said some private schools like Christ's Hospital in Horsham (pictured) have a diverse pupil base where the majority receive bursaries and only a few students pay the full fees

'Examples included moving house in 
order to access a better school and employing a personal tutor - one 
quarter of all parents in London pay for private tuition in the course 
of their child’s school career,' he said

'Moral
opprobrium attached to neither of these, though the latter is of course
paying for a private education, and the former is not social but 
postcode mobility, potentially productive of social division.'

Dr Hands suggested that in some cases, state schools are more exclusive than private schools.

He cited The London Oratory School, a state Catholic secondary school, claiming that only a small percentage of its pupils are eligible for free lunches - a key measure of poverty - and that it had been reported that houses nearby were on sale for millions of pounds.

Former Labour schools minister Lord Adonis said parents who send children to private schools are buying a 'high quality academic education'

At the other end of the scale Christ’s
Hospital, a fee-paying school in Horsham, West Sussex, the majority of 
pupils receive bursaries and few pay the full fees.

Ahead of his speech, Dr Hands said: 'My 
feeling is as a parent that over the decades people have come to feel 
more bothered about the concept of private education, and that has been 
politically fuelled.'

Earlier this year, Lord Adonis, who served as a schools minister under the last Labour government, said that parents who send their children to private school are buying a 'high quality academic education'.

But he added that it can be 'seriously disabling for students going to exclusive fee-paying schools that they see so little of society while they are at those schools.'

Dr Hands said: 'Our schools are not marooned on islands of privilege; they are instead preventing our island from being marooned. It is not our schools that are splendidly isolated but our politicians.'

He also used his speech children have been 'neglected' by government education policy in the last half century.

'The story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of Government and the disappearance of the child.

'More radically put, it is by extension the intrusion of the state, and the disappearance of love,' he said.
