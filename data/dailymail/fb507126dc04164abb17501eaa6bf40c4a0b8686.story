One in four adults has the maths skills of a nine-year-old or worse and struggles with the most basic everyday sums.

According to a shock report, more than eight million adults in England are considered to lack even basic numeracy. 

The figures in the Skills For Life survey reveal that this quarter of the population has difficulty in understanding price labels and the sums involved in paying household bills.

Their abilities are on a par with those expected of pupils at primary school aged between seven to nine.

In an even more disturbing development, the number of adults in this group is nearly a million more than it was a decade ago.

This is despite a stream of costly initiatives in recent years designed to improve adult numeracy.

A further nine million adults have the maths skills expected of a child aged nine to 11.

Those in this group are likely to struggle in calculating change, using train timetables or working out deductions on their pay slip.

The Skills For Life survey revealed that altogether 49 per cent of working-age adults in England – about 17million in total – have the maths skills of a child at primary school. 

Numbers had risen from 15million in 2003, when a similar survey was conducted.

The report also revealed that fewer than one in five 16 to 18-year-olds can demonstrate skills equivalent to a grade A* to C pass in maths at GCSE.

This is despite the A* to C pass rate for the GCSE exam now being 60 per cent.

Chris Humphries, chairman of the charity National Numeracy, said: ‘This discrepancy is both puzzling and worrying for everyone involved in education and merits further investigation.

‘Too many adults are struggling with everyday maths.’ 

The survey, which questioned 7,200 people aged 16 to 65, also revealed that more than five million adults – 15 per cent of the working population – struggle with simple reading and writing.

The Department for Business, which released the 400-page report, admitted that English and maths skills had ‘a long way to go’.

Ministers said improving basic skills was vital to a ‘thriving economy’.

Labour launched a major campaign in 2000 to boost the basic skills of adults but it is said to have mainly benefited literacy, where performance has improved since 2003.

Ministers said that tough new English Baccalaureate Certificates to replace GCSEs from 2017 in core subjects would help to boost standards in both English and maths.

From September of next year, new study programmes will require pupils to keep working towards GCSEs in maths and English if they failed to achieve them by the age of 16.

Free maths and English GCSE courses are now available for adults, and other qualifications for those with lower skills levels.

The survey, which questioned adults for whom English is their first language, found that literacy skills were worst in London and the North-East.

Numeracy skills were worst in the North-East, followed by London and the East Midlands.

Skills minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Good English and maths are vital for getting a job and playing a full part in society.

‘We have doubled the funding for adult English and maths because they are so important.

‘I would urge anyone who is struggling to take advantage of the provision that is on offer, which now includes maths and English GCSEs for adults who missed out the first time round.

‘These essential skills are the building blocks of a productive society and a thriving economy. I am determined that everyone should have the chance to achieve their very best.’
