Moving on: Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly (above) is leaving the BBC to set up a charity helping women facing discrimination at work

Miriam O’Reilly is to leave the BBC to launch a support service for women facing discrimination in the workplace, a year after her own ageism tribunal victory against the Corporation.

The former Countryfile presenter, who is thought to have received a six-figure payout following last January’s verdict, is also planning to take on other broadcasting work.

She is only one year into the three-year-deal she was offered to return to the BBC in the wake of her victory, which has seen her co-host daytime show Crimewatch Roadshow.

Miss O’Reilly, 54, was one of four women presenters in their 40s and 50s who were removed from BBC1 rural affairs show Countryfile in 2009, when the show was being revamped for peak time.

In last year’s landmark ruling the BBC was accused of being obsessed with attracting younger viewers and of ‘social engineering’ for sacking her because she was seen as too old.

Yesterday Miss O’Reilly said: ‘I have had a rewarding time at the BBC over the last year but am now choosing to move on and work on other projects for a while including my charity, Women’s Equality Network.’

Removed: Miss O'Reilly on Countryfile. She was dismissed by the BBC because she was seen to be too old, but won a landmark court ruling which accused the Corporation of 'social engineering'

The presenter has set up the charity with the lawyer who helped her win her case, Camilla Palmer. Its website will launch next month.

Miss O’Reilly added: ‘We realised from the amount of emails and letters Camilla and I were getting how many women didn’t know where to go for help and advice about all kinds of discrimination – sexism, racism, ageism. It really did surprise us.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We would like to thank Miriam for her work on BBC television and radio and we wish her well in her new challenges but hope there will be opportunities to work together again in the future.’
