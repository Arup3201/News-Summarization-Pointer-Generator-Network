A police force has scrapped an anti-violence online poster after Twitter users said it showed an officer with a riot stick hitting a victim begging for mercy. 

The image was supposed to promote a campaign to stop drunk and violent people entering pubs and clubs. 

But Twitter users quickly pointed out that the logo looked more like police brutality - claiming it appeared to show a riot officer beating a prone victim. 

Ridiculed: Devon and Cornwall Police were mocked on Twitter for this online campaign poster - which appeared to depict an officer with a riot stick hitting a victim begging for mercy

Paul Cruikshank tweeted '@DC-Police @euanmccolm How many drunk people the Dept's arrested have had a helmet on and carrying a truncheon?'. 

Police replied that it was 'meant to show one drunk person attacking another, which often happens when drinkers go overboard'. 

But this met with a response from Phil Ellery, who tweeted '@DC-Police a drunk person wearing a riot helmet and carrying a truncheon?'. 

Amazingly, the image can be downloaded from a number of clip-art websites, including pubzi and clker, by searching for the term 'police brutality'.

A Devon and Cornwall spokesman today told MailOnline: 'The breathalyser campaign in Torquay has been extremely successful in contributing to reducing crime in and around the town centre. Violent crime was reduced by 45 per cent in January compared to last year.

'The image used on the infographic posted on social media to celebrate the success of the initiative was intended to depict a violent incident between two drunk members of the public. 

Online results: The same image can be found on this clip-art website by searching for 'police brutality'

Another clip-art website, called clker.com, has the same image stored, again with the title 'police brutality' 

On this website, openclipart, the controversial image is searchable under a number of terms including 'violence', 'brutality', 'demonstration' and 'police'

'It has since been made clear that the picture could be seen as showing a police officer hitting somebody. This was not our intention.

'We apologise for any offence and it has now been removed. We hope that this does not detract from the great campaign we have run with our partners and the licensing trade in Torquay.  

The picture, posted yesterday, was accompanied by the message 'Breathalyser scheme #RU2drunk... keeping you safe'. 

Police want potentially drunk people to be breathalysed before they are allowed into pubs and clubs where they could spark violence. 

The spokesman added 'The breathalyser campaign in Torquay has been extremely successful in reducing crime in and around the town centre. 

'Violent crime was reduced by 45% in January compared to last year.'

Devon and Cornwall Police could not provide a copy of the updated info graphic. It is said to look exactly the same - but without the controversial image in the top right corner.

Embarrassing: The force (headquarters pictured) initially defended the info graphic image but has now changed it by removing the controversial image
