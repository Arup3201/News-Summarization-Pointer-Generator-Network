This gutsy dragonfly toyed with certain death by landing on the nose of a frog that could have easily gobbled it up for dinner.

Living life on the edge, the dragonfly perched right between the eyes of the unfazed frog and they sat together in a pond in Indonesia.

The dragonfly’s unusual resting spot was captured on camera by amateur photographer Adhi Prayoga in his garden pond.

Mr Prayoga, 41, said: ‘The frog would normally swallow the dragonfly down in one gulp, but he actually seemed quite happy for him to be sitting on his head.

‘I had about 30 seconds to shoot the images, but once the dragonfly flew away, he buzzed around and then landed back on the frog's head again.

‘He was so lucky - I couldn't believe how fortunate he was to have picked such a placid frog to land on.’

Perhaps it was frog breeding season, when frogs do not feed at all, explaining why the insect got away with the daring manoeuvre.

When frogs are active they feed on any moving invertebrates of an appropriate size such as insects, snails, worms and slugs which they catch with their long, sticky tongues.

Adult frogs tend to feed entirely on land while younger frogs also feed in water.
