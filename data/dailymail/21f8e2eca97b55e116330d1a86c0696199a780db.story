Kumar Sangakkara is entering the beginning of the end of his international career. Having recently retired from the shortest form, he plans to wind down in the other two and then, a little surprisingly, finish up with a couple of seasons in county cricket.

When mapping out his future beyond  Sri Lanka’s two Tests this month, Sangakkara, 36, talks with boyish enthusiasm for the English domestic game.

So far he has had just a couple of bite-sized chunks, seven seasons apart. But he sells the chill of Durham’s Chester-le-Street, his temporary home for a fortnight last month, like it’s the sunshine of the Seychelles.

Phew! Kumar Sangakkara admits relief that Kevin Pietersen will not be facing Sri Lanka in the Test series

Out! Kevin Pietersen was omitted following question marks over his attitude during the Ashes defeat

Put simply, to recruit Sangakkara is to recruit a great of the game. His Test average going into the first Test against England at Lord’s on Thursday is a jaw-dropping 58.07.

Not since Graeme Pollock (60.97) was stymied in his prime by South Africa’s sporting isolation 44 years ago has a player ended with such a high return. In addition to his Test acumen, he is one of only four players to have scored more than 12,000 runs in one-day internationals.

Not bad for a guy who keeps wicket.

‘My end in one-day cricket will be the 2015 World Cup, if I get there fit and in form,’ he says. ‘Then we’ll sit down and see whether I am needed for Test cricket.

‘Who knows whether a county will have me for a season or two? I would like to wind down slowly as it can be a bit of a shock to the system if you stop completely. A couple of seasons (in England) would be fantastic. I really enjoyed my time in 2007 with Warwickshire, and  Durham have been great. I like the feel of county dressing rooms. There is a huge amount of ability in them and a huge amount of hunger.

‘Durham have been exceptional in that sense. For a side that’s won the County Championship three times in six years, they seem to have a fantastic attitude, both towards each other and wanting to achieve more. I always say that learning is a two-way street, but once I’ve finished my international career it will be about trying to do a proper job for the county I’m in.

Big hitter: Kumar Sangakkara has a Test average of 58.07 and has hit more than 12,000 runs in ODIs

‘Cricket brings out who you are as a person. It requires mental strength but also strength of character. But it’s only a game. There’s a lot more to life that you can experience and it will enhance what you do out there in the middle. I have been pretty lucky that way, so anything I can do to share my experiences would be welcome.’

Sangakkara is clear on what has been his driving force. ‘It’s about ensuring that I’m the best I can be. Your aim is to reach a standard of excellence you are happy with and leave the game a bit better for you having played it.

‘All the time you are striving to meet your goals — trying to get as many Test hundreds as you can, trying to get into the 10,000-run club (which he achieved in the 2012 Boxing Day Test at Melbourne). These are things that I did not think  possible at one time in my career. As I got accustomed to international cricket those became goals I set for myself.’

Great loss: Kumar Sangakkara was 'bitterly disappointed at losing coach Paul Fabrace (R) to England

Sangakkara thinks highly of Paul  Farbrace, the Englishman who spent four months as Sri Lanka head coach up to the World Twenty20 win in April before he was headhunted by the ECB to become the new assistant to Peter Moores.

‘From Paul’s time in 2007, as assistant to Trevor Bayliss, he proved to be a fantastic human being and a really great, rounded coach,’ affirms Sangakkara. ‘Caring about players, and being able to express that, elicits a far better response than chunks of strategy and analysis. His tenure was fantastic. One loss in 18 games and a World Cup win!

‘It was bitterly disappointing for the side to lose him. We would have liked it to  continue for a lot longer.’

Quite a catch: Wicket keeper revealed he would like to end his career playing county cricket in England

Sangakkara’s recent stint with Durham was an exercise in tightening technique. Combating the moving ball in England will be paramount to Sri Lanka’s chances on what is traditionally one of the toughest tours for Asian cricketers.  Having struggled against Yorkshire on his debut, Sangakkara responded by taking 159 off Sussex’s attack, his highest score in England to date.

‘Playing in England is a challenge but not insurmountable,’ says Sangakkara. ‘The key is for guys like me to get the runs on the board to put pressure on the opposition. One thing you accept with experience is that getting out in the first couple of overs is all right. Getting to 20 or 30 and making a silly mistake is not.’

England are clearly in transition: only a handful of players remain from the Test side that shared the short series in Sri Lanka two years ago. Most notably, Kevin Pietersen (ostracised) and Graeme Swann (retired) have gone. Sangakkara, though, is mystified that any international team would seek change in a bid for uniformity.

It takes all sorts: Accomodating different individuals like Lasith Malinga is crucial, says Kumar Sangakkara

‘Accommodating difference and valuing individuality are the most important things in a dressing room,’ he says. ‘For us, it’s been like that with Lasith (Malinga). He is very different in the way he looks and as a person. There are certain people you might not have dinner with, but that doesn’t take away from the fact they will be valuable players in a national cause, going out trying to win matches.

‘I don’t know the reasons for KP’s  exclusion but he’s an amazing player. I’ve watched him, admired him and he is undoubtedly an out-and-out match-winner.

‘Of course, as an opposition player I’m not disappointed he’s not around. We know what damage he could have done to us. To not have him walk in — that  presence he has — is a bit of a relief.’
