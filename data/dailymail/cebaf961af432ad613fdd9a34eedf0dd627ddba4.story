Normal service has been resumed. Four days after their first defeat in eight months and Chelsea delivered a nerveless return to form.

They have completed the group phase with 17 goals - more than any other team - and Jose Mourinho declared the Champions League starts here, with the ‘sharks in the ocean’.

It was just the response he hoped for after losing at Newcastle United on Saturday. His team were in control early thanks to a Cesc Fabregas penalty and Andre Schurrle’s first goal since September.

There was no discernible apprehension that the first serious set-back of the campaign might develop into the type of stumbling sequence which Carlo Ancelotti liked to call ‘a bad moment’.

The outcome was barely in doubt. Even when they threatened to nod off and allowed Sporting Lisbon to shorten the deficit, five minutes into the second half, Chelsea struck again, through John Mikel Obi.

The sight of a Mikel goal always signifies a special occasion for Chelsea supporters. This was only his fifth in more than eight years at the club, and his first ever in the Champions League.

Another treat for fans at the Bridge was a hotly anticipated debut for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, an 18-year-old midfielder, who has advanced through the club’s youth ranks to great acclaim. He is the flag-bearer of what they hope will be the ‘Made in Chelsea’ generation but it will take more than this brief cameo to establish that.

There was also a favour for former favourite Roberto Di Matteo. Defeat for Sporting allowed his Schalke team to progress at their expense with a win in Maribor, but most important for Mourinho was a professional reaction to Saturday’s defeat.

‘We were focused and serious,’ said the Chelsea boss, satisfied his squad have the mental application to launch another long unbeaten run. ‘We showed a good attitude and did what we had to do. We played seriously and deserved to win.’

That said, Sporting did not provide the most formidable opposition and seemed strangely uninterested in acquiring the point which would have been enough for them to qualify for the last 16. This has not the most testing of Champions League groups for Chelsea. But, not only were they prolific, with 17 goals, they conceded only three in six games.

Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus leap out as those to avoid in Monday’s draw for the last 16 but Mourinho said: ‘We have five possible opponents and each one is hard. Paris would be good because it’s easy for travel and easy for our fans. You think Basle is easy? We lost twice against them last year. They beat Liverpool. Leverkusen is not easy, or Shakhtar. It is not easy.

‘I don’t think any of the big teams is out. Maybe Liverpool, but all the teams who want to win it are in it. There are a few sharks in the ocean, but I like it this way.’

Mourinho swam with sharks on holiday in French Polynesia. ‘I didn’t want to go, but my wife and kids pushed me,’ he grinned.

This time, he goes happily into the knockout phase of a competition he has twice won. ‘The real Champions League starts now,’ said Mourinho. ‘What can we do? I don’t know. Last season, we were not one of the top four for sure and we played in the semi-finals. Let’s see what we can do this time step by step.’

This win was achieved while resting players like John Terry, Eden Hazard, Oscar and Willian and those who stepped in proved they are ready and able.

There was the reassuring presence of Petr Cech in goal and it was an important night for Mohamed Salah and Filipe Luis, who were in tandem on the left and quickly capitalised on the inexperience of right-back Ricardo Esgaio.

Luis squared up to Esgaio, stuck the ball through his legs and drew the foul. Fabregas converted the penalty in the eighth minute.

Schurrle, making his first start since he was hauled off at half-time during a draw Maribor last month, scored the second from the edge of the box. The move started on the left with Luis then Nemanja Matic carrying the ball forward. Schurrle controlled the pass, turned centre-half Mauricio and unleashed a crisp drive which flashed into the bottom corner.

Sporting offered little more after the interval, but as Chelsea relaxed and lost impetus, Jonathan Silva pulled a goal back.

Schurrle was guilty of failing to deal with a deep and swirling cross and his clearance fell to Silva who took the ball down on his chest and volleyed low past Cech.

For six minutes, there was a game on, but Mourinho’s players stirred and Mikel struck, toe-ending the ball over the goal-line from a couple of inches, after a swerving free-kick, taken by Fabregas, had been flicked on at the near post.

This was the sign for Mourinho to send on his substitutes including Loftus-Cheek with seven minutes to go. ‘I said to him, I give you this and you give me a nice bottle of red wine,’ said Mourinho. ‘He said, “no problem”.’
