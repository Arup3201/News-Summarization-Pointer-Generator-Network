Bubba Watson defeated Tim Clark on the first hole of a play-off to win the WGC-HSBC Champions on Sunday after an extraordinary finish to the £5.4million event in Shanghai.

Watson was two shots clear with three holes to play, only to bogey the 16th and run up a double bogey on the 17th after failing to escape a greenside bunker at the first attempt.

That dropped the Masters champion one shot behind playing partners Clark and Rickie Fowler, as well as the final group of Graeme McDowell, Hiroshi Iwata and Martin Kaymer.

Watson celebrated wildly after holing a superb bunker shot on the 18th for eagle, which took him into a play-off

Watson then drained his putt for birdie in the play-off in front of a packed crowd on 18 to seal a dramatic victory

Clark looked in pole position when he hit his third shot to the par-five 18th to four feet and saw Fowler find the water and Watson a greenside bunker.

However, Watson then amazingly holed his bunker shot for an eagle and Clark's birdie was only good enough to leave the pair tied on 11 under, with the final group needing to birdie the last to join the play-off.

Kaymer's chances disappeared when his approach flew over the green into the water, while McDowell and Iwata missed from 18 and 12 feet respectively.

It was not a good day for overnight leader Graeme McDowell (left) who shot one-over par to finish tied third

Rickie Fowler (centre) playing in his trademark orange, went round in 70 for two-under, also finishing third

Clark and Watson returned to the 18th for the play-off and Watson found the same greenside bunker with his second shot after Clarke had hit his third to around 20 feet.

Watson was unable to repeat his heroics from the sand but after Clark had left his birdie attempt short, the left-hander holed his birdie putt to seal victory.
