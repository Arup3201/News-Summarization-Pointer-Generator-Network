Firefighters are tackling 'one of the biggest fires in months' after around 1,500 tonnes of scrap metal has set alight.

More than 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines are battling the fire, which struck at a scrapyard in Dagenham, east London, at around 3.20pm today.

The blaze has hit just hours before firefighters were due to strike at 6.30pm in a row over pensions.

Scene: More than 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines are battling the fire, which struck at a scrapyard in east London at around 3.20pm today

Huge: The blaze struck at a scrapyard in east London at around 3.20pm today - sending a massive cloud of black smoke into the sky

Response: Firefighters are still tackling the fire, which is deemed 'one of the biggest in months'

Cause: Cylinders are believed to have been involved in the fire - with a hazard zone put in place in case they explode when exposed to the high temperatures

However, union members who would have normally been on duty have been immediately recalled to their stations to deal with the 'major' incident.

A spokesman for London Fire Brigade (LFB) said: 'A massive pile of scrap metal - around 1,500 tonnes - is on fire.

'It is really, really large fire - we have not had a fire of this size for quite a few months.

'The fire is in the open air, not in a building, and crews are battling to bring it under control.'

No injuries: A London Fire Brigade spokesman said no-one has been injured in the blaze in Perry Road

Advice: People living near the scrapyard have been advised to shut their windows to avoid inhaling black smoke from the blaze

She added that no-one has been injured in the blaze in Perry Road.

Cylinders are believed to have been involved in the fire - with a hazard zone put in place in case they explode when exposed to the high temperatures.

People living near the scrapyard have been advised to shut their windows to avoid inhaling black smoke from the blaze.

'There is a
lot of smoke in the local area and we are asking residents to close their doors
and windows,' said the LFB spokesman.

Shocking: The blaze has hit just hours before firefighters were due to strike in a row over pensions

Called off: However, union members who would have normally been on duty have been immediately recalled to their stations to deal with the 'major' incident

Investigation: The cause of the fire is not yet known - with investigators due to be called to the scene after the fire has been controlled

Firefighters in England and Wales were due to go on strike this evening in a row with the government about pension ages.

Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) had claimed they wanted the government to offer guarantees on jobs or pensions following plans to raise the retirement age for firefighters from 55 to 60.

They had planned to walk out between 6.30pm and 11.30pm - however, the scrapyard blaze has led to the strike being called off and firefighters immediately recalled to their stations.

This was under an agreed 'Recall to Duty Procedure' and was voluntary, the LFB said in a statement.

However, the LFB spokesman said the FBU has told firefighters not to follow the recall notice - with the union claiming the recall is not valid because there is no risk to life.

The cause of the fire is not yet known. Investigators are due to be called to the scene after the fire has been controlled.
