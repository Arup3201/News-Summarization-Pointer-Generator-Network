Stuck in the middle: Katherine Jackson's 'disappearance' cuts to the heart of a family divided

It's a tale as old as time - a family become bitterly divided over the will of a wealthy relative and descend into bickering and skulduggery.

But when Paris Jackson, the beloved 
daughter of late pop icon Michael, reported her elderly grandmother 
missing last week, it soon became evident that this most famous of musical 
dynasties is riven with particularly sinister feuding.

'I haven’t spoken with her in a week. I want her home now,' the 14-year-old tweeted, clearly distressed about the whereabouts of her guardian.

Katherine, 82 , has since been 
located at an Arizona spa under the care of her daughter, Rebbie, but 
her grandchildren, with whom she lives day-to-day in Encino, California,
 were clearly never informed that she was to be taken on a trip.

So why would Michael's siblings try and drive a wedge between their mother and her young, dependent grandchildren?

It all comes down to Michael, of course, who is in death as he was in life - the jewel in the crown of the Jackson empire.

His will is at the centre of this 
unseemly scuffle after some of his brothers and sisters baulked at being
 denied a slice of his estimable fortune

When he died of a drug overdose in June 2009 Michael left much of his $600 million to his mother and his three children.

Katherine became guardian of Prince, 15, Paris, and Blanket, 10, and the rest was designated for charity.

But five of Jackson’s brothers and sisters claim the singer’s will is 'fake, flawed and fraudulent' and
  that his lawyers forged his signature.

Singer Janet Jackson surprised many by joining  former Jackson Five stars Tito and Jermaine and siblings Randy and Rebbie to challenge the will.

Divided: Kelly Griffin, LaToya Jackson, Stephen Hill, Katherine Jackson and
 daughter Rebbie (far right) who the grandmother is staying with in Arizona, LaToya is not challenging her late brother's will 

Last month they wrote a strongly-worded letter to John Branca and John McClain, Jackson’s two lawyers who were named his legal executors.

Now sources tell TMZ that Katherine's
 trip to the Tuscon spa with Rebbie is all part of 'a concerted effort' 
to get Katharine on board with their claim.

Yet despite the LAPD treating the 
case as an open investigation, as reported by TMZ, the disputers are 
trying to claim there is nothing egregious at play here.

'Mother is fine,' said Michael’s brother Jermaine. 'She is merely an 82-year-old woman following
doctor’s orders to rest up and de-stress.'

But a source told Britain's Daily Express newspaper: 'When Katherine was reported missing that wasn’t just concern for a frail old lady, that was concern over a fabulously wealthy estate.'

A family member revealed: 'Katherine is tired. The fighting over Michael’s money started shortly
  after his death and continues.'

The quarrelling quintet suggest they have proof that Michael was in New York on the day he supposedly signed his will in Los Angeles and accuse the lawyers of lying to Katherine Jackson to get her to increase their pay for running the estate.

'Your actions are affecting her health and on top of that we’ve just found out she recently had a ministroke,' the five Jacksons wrote.

Our brother told us, in no uncertain terms and without hesitation in the months prior to his death, that he despised both of you and he did not want either of you to have anything to do with his life or estate for that matter,' they wrote.

'She’s not equipped to handle the stress load you are putting on her.'

Siblings La Toya, Jackie and Marlon have not joined their brothers and sisters on the claim

And young Paris is outspoken in her disgust for certain kinfolk: 'I will defend my beloved family member with all I have, even if it means from other family members.

Appeal: Paris Jackson, Michael's 14-year-old daughter, tweeted her concerns for her grandmother on Sunday morning

Still worried: Paris wasn't to speak to her grandmother, her uncle claims Katherine has been ordered not to use phones or computers by a doctor

'What has been said about my grandmother is a rumour… she is completely fine. I don’t appreciate you telling everyone things that aren’t true.

She said of her Uncle Randy: 'Maybe he should have respect for his mother.'

Katherine Jackson did obtain a judge’s permission to investigate the will’s validity but never pursued it to court.

The singer’s executors replied: 'We are saddened that false and defamatory accusations grounded
  in stale internet conspiracy theories are now being made by certain members of Michael’s family whom he chose to leave out of his will.'

Sources close to the estate claim Randy and Jermaine are trying to make Katherine seem infirm,
  hoping to get themselves appointed as her conservators, with access to more than £50,000 a month in money from the estate.

Reassuring: Michael's brother Jermaine assured that his mother is resting under doctor's orders but without her grandchildren claiming to know much more

Status updates: Jermaine Jackson took to Twitter to issue statements on his mother's whereabouts through the weekend

But Jermaine insisted: 'This family’s first and foremost concern is our mother’s health, welfare and wellbeing. Nothing else.'

They insist that Katherine hasn't 
contacted her granddaughter as she is on medical orders to 'stay away 
from phones and computers.'

However Paris, rather understandably, has a fear of doctors after her father was killed by an overdose of powerful anaesthetic propofol by his physician, Dr Conrad Murray, who was jailed for four years last November for involuntary manslaughter,

'The same doctor that testified on behalf of Dr Murray saying my father was a drug addict (a lie) is caring for my grandmother,' tweeted Paris, referring to Dr Allan Metzger, who tended Katherine days before her disappearance, before adding: 'Just saying.'

Still, the rebel five insist that it's their mother they care for, and not their little brother's millions.

Whatever the truth, there's no doubt that the mysterious case of the missing matriarch is just the beginning of a nefarious saga.
