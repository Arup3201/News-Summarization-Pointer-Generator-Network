Struggling to understand why you can't keep a fella? Well, is it because you always pinch his smokes, or you just don't know enough about current affairs?

It could be if a vintage dating guide is to be taken seriously, in which a famous movie star of the era shares six top tips for 'enchanting a man'.

The guide, penned by Hungarian-American actor and film director Cornel Wilde, is from the October 1950 issue of Woman's Own and sheds light on the dating game during that time.

A 1950's guide to pulling: A hilarious extract from a 50s issue of Woman's Own outlines six ways to 'enchant a man'

Cornel, described by the magazine as a 
'tall, dark and handsome film star', shares what Woman's Own said 'every 
woman ought to know about enchanting a man.'

In his article, Cornel says that the best quality to have, in his advice, isn't an 'exciting hat, exotic perfume or admirable circle of friends' but charm, which he says is what most men look for in a woman.

He explains that charm makes a man feel 'wonderful' and that the little things, such as a warm smile, soft voice, taking interest in sport, considering a man's pocket and getting on well with their mother, are what enchants a man.

He adds: 'Take care to be punctual. Please, that's so important because it really is the nicest compliment to the man you're meeting.'

And it sounds like today's selfie craze and penchant for showing off online would not have gone down well with the fellas in the 50s as Cornel said:  'Above all, the charming and enchanting woman is the one who is completely natural.'I've seen women ruin any chance of 
making the right impression simply because she is trying to impress him,
 or, to put it more bluntly, showing off.'

Cornel, who died in 1989 and was twice married and twice divorced, then goes on to outline his six top tips for enchanting a man, which he says will 'weave a spell tightly about a man and help towards making him entirely yours.'

His first tip is being thoughtful and surprising your man with, for example, tickets to the theatre.

He also shares his advice on how to react when a man asks you to meet his friends. 'A charming woman smiles sincerely, remembers names, finds out what kind of job the other person does, is genuinely interested in them,' he writes.

Nothing, he says, infuriates a man more than a women who 'continually smokes his cigarettes'.

'It's a sign of meanness, which immediately disenchants any man,' he says.

Cornel emphasises the importance of keeping up-to-date with current affairs - and making intelligent remarks about them.

When it comes to birthdays, he lays out the rules of expenditure. 'Never buy very expensive presents for a man unless you're engaged or married to him; it can lead to too many complications.'

And finally, he advises his female readers to take an interest in her man's clothes. 'It flatters a man to be made a fuss of, it enchatnts him if you take care of him,' he concludes.

Although 
the type of Womanâ€™s Own content has moved on since this article, the 
weekly magazine say its mantra has remained the same since the 1930s.

Terry 
Tavner, Editor in Large of Woman's Own, said: 'Since 1932, Woman's Own 
has been entertaining and educating women of every generation.

'The magazine is less about age and more about life stages, which is why we attract readers in their 30s through to their 70s.

'Woman's
 Own is a rite of passage, handed down from generation to generation and
 we are honoured to continue that tradition in the 21st century.'

A spokesperson for CupidSpeedDater.com, who uncovered the piece, said: 'Thankfully 
times have changed and the dating game is more relaxed.'
