Two men who stripped off to take a dip in the sea in Northern Ireland were threatened with a criminal record and warned that they might be added to the sex offenders' register.

Pictures that emerged online of the event show a naked man standing in Belfast Lough in County Down, hands over his private parts, with two police officers speaking to him as he made his way towards the shore.

Campaigners said it is 'absolutely monstrous' that the police have decided to pass the case to the public prosecutor’s office, who has yet to decide whether the two men should be charged with indecent exposure.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland took to Facebook to warn people against similar behaviour. In a post last week, the police said:

'NOT a good idea, we are treating this kind of behaviour extremely seriously and will be continuing to take action against anyone who decides to do the same.'

It added: 'There are young children in these areas too. You could end up with a Criminal Record and placed on the Sex Offender Register.'

Michael McDonald, North Down and Ards Area Commander Chief Inspector,  said: 'We have consistently said we want people to come to local beauty spots and enjoy a day out with family and friends.'

'However, we have also been very clear that a robust approach will be taken against those who break the law or do not comply with the ban on alcohol in public areas.

'Visitors have the right to enjoy their day without fear or concern in relation to the behaviour of others.

He added: 'We want people to act responsibly and with consideration for others and taking your clothes off in a very busy area with lots of young children about is neither responsible or considerate.

'As police officers, we want people to think about the consequences of their actions, something that seems like a bit of fun to you could bring you to the attention of police who will deal with you accordingly and appropriately and you could end up before a court and with a criminal record.'

Speaking on the incident a spokesman for British Naturism called the police threats 'absolutely monstrous'.

Andrew Welch, the volunteer organisation's national spokesman, said: 'The law is very clear that being naked in public is not a crime.'

'It has to be proved by a complainant that the nude person intended to cause somebody alarm or distress.'

He added that going on the beach naked, 'simply because you would like to have an all over tan' is 'definitely not illegal'.

Mr Welch said that it is 'absolutely monstrous' that the pair might be put on the sex offenders' register, calling the threat 'almost medieval and pointing out that if they were added it could 'harm their whole careers'.

Commenting on the police's point that there were children present, Mr Welch said: 'There is no evidence anywhere of any harm to children at the mere sight of adult nudity,' adding that it can in fact benefit children.

The incident took place last week, when parts of Northern Ireland saw temperatures soar to more than 27C.
