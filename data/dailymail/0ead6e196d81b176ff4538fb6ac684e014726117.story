Airline industry insiders say the next 9/11 style attack is already being planned and that they’ve seen in-flight ‘probes’ being conducted by terrorist groups to test security.

The US Airlines Pilots Association recently released a memo internally about ‘several cases recently throughout the (airline) industry of what appear to be probes, or dry runs, to test our procedures and reaction to an in-flight threat.’

Now other unions and even one concerned Air Marshal are speaking out about the threat and about what they say is government reluctance to do something about it.

Safe? The US Airlines Pilots Association believes that terrorist 'dry runs' are occurring across the industry as groups plot the next 9/11 style attack

‘Foolish,’ is what Wolf Koch, a pilot for Delta and chairman at the Air Line Pilots Association International, calls anyone who isn’t eternally vigilant about preventing the next attack.

Koch, like the US Airlines union, believes an attack could well be in the works.

‘100%, no question in my mind. They're going to try it again,’ he told WTSP.

Part of what scares the unions are events like the one that occurred on US Airlines flight 1880 on September 2 of this year as it flew from Washington, DC to Orlando.

The next 9/11? Industry insiders like Wolf Koch of the Air Line Pilots Association International say the the next attempt at a 9/11 style attack is likely in the works. ‘If a dry run's occurring, the attack is shortly following,' he said

In their memo, the US Airlines Pilots Association describes commotion started by a ‘Middle Eastern’ man who bolted from his seat toward the flight deck.

Face of evil: Mohamed Atta helped plot the 9/11 attacks and was part of a group who staked out planes in Boston, in what may have been 'dry runs' just a month before the World Trade Center went down

At the last moment, he turned and entered the lavatory. He stayed there for ‘a considerable length of time.’

Meanwhile, his three cohorts began ‘generally making a scene,’ in what the union believes was an attempt to distract or otherwise keep the flight crew occupied.

According to WTSP, a similar dry run occurred in August of 2001, just before the September 11 attacks. Actor James Woods complained to flight attendants of a commotion on the plane.

It was later revealed that Egyptian 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta had shaken down Woods’ flight before takeoff and the men he complained about were some of the minds behind 9/11.

The union memo mentions ‘several cases,’ and both US Airways and the TSA confirmed the disturbance aboard flight 1880.

However, the TSA said the event warranted no further investigation.

One anonymous Air Marshal disagreed.

‘They're liars. They're flat out liars,’ said the marshal, who insisted the flight 1880 incident has serious safety implications. ‘We're waiting for the next 911 to happen. It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.’

Wolf Koch concurred.

‘If a dry run's occurring,’ he said, ‘the attack is shortly following.’
