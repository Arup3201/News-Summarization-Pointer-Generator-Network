Women soldiers should be allowed to fight alongside men on the frontline for the first time, a report will recommend today (file picture)

Just 34 women will be tough enough for front line action, it has emerged.

It comes as the first female to command an all-male squadron has warned that putting women on the front line could make the army less effective.

Major Judith Webb said that women were 'physically different' - even though she believed in 'equality'. 

Her comments came as a report recommended that women soldiers should be allowed to fight alongside men on the frontline for the first time. 

The Ministry of Defence is moving towards the historic change after a six-month review into whether women should be able to serve in infantry and tank regiments.

Female fighters could be in combat roles as soon as 2016, senior defence sources have told the Daily Mail.

But the review estimates that, on current levels of recruitment, around seven women a year would pass through training to qualify for infantry units and around the same number for the RAF Regiment, according to The Telegraph.

About 14 would qualify for the Royal Armoured Corps and only six for the Royal Marines.

The review has quashed doubts within the MoD that allowing women to serve in frontline roles would damage the ‘cohesion’ of the armed forces on the battlefield.

Military top brass will say there needs to be further research into the ‘physiological demands’ placed on those in close combat roles. 

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Major Webb, who retired in 1986, said: ‘We had a maximum of four women in my squadron and it was perfectly natural and normal for the guys would do all the heavy jobs and those jobs that were physically demanding while women would do the slightly less physical it was just the normal course of events.

‘When we are talking about an infantry section of eight guys and you’ve got one person who is not actually as physically strong or as physically capable as the other seven over possibly an extended period of time, which is what has not been tested, that could create an effect on our combat effectiveness,’ added major Webb, who was the first woman to command an all-male field force squadron in the British Army.

A senior defence source told the Mail: ‘The review has concluded ministers are minded to approve women in combat roles.’

Last night politicians welcomed the findings, which are due to be published today.

Labour MP John Woodcock, a member of the Defence Select Committee, said: ‘This is a challenging but hugely welcome step forward that will help make our armed forces the very best they can be. 

'Keeping our country safe is too important to exclude anyone who can play a role – that means giving women the chance to serve on the frontline in addition to all the other ways in which they are excelling already in the forces.’

But some senior officers fear that repealing the centuries-old rule will lead to a drop in standards in the armed forces. Major General Patrick Cordingley called the change a ‘mistake’. 

Mr Cordingley, who commanded the Desert Rats during the first Gulf War, told the Mail: ‘There is a political imperative. However, I think that it is a mistake from the armed forces.

'I can understand why politically it is a good thing to be seen to be doing – on the other hand, the practicalities of women in the infantry and armoured corps are considerable and should not be overlooked.

‘Being in a fighting unit, you need to concentrate on the enemy, you don’t want distractions looking after women, which inevitably you will do. It is a diversion.’

Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, previously said women fighters would harm the ‘warrior ethos’ and damage the fighting capabilities of the soldiers.

Women can already find themselves on the frontline and extremely close to the enemy while serving as medics, intelligence specialists, artillery spotters, logisticians or signallers.

They also serve with distinction as combat pilots. In light of the findings, a senior military source said: ‘There is a real desire among ministers and the military to open up ground combat roles to women.

‘This detailed review is a big step forward in the process, however, it is clear further work needs to be done before a final decision is taken.

‘The wellbeing of all our personnel is of the utmost importance, but there is genuine hope this will be a reality come 2016.’

If the plans go ahead, women on the frontline will be subject to the same physical tests as men.

It is understood only a small minority of the 16,000 women serving in the armed forces would want to or be capable of passing the tests. 

The next research programme is expected to deliver a report in 2016, which will inform a final decision on whether the exclusion can be safely lifted.

Britain is behind the times on the matter compared to other countries. Of the 28 members of Nato, just two others, Turkey and Slovakia, still bar women from combat roles.

The US lifted its ban last year, joining countries including Germany, Canada, France and Israel.

As part of the UK review, thousands of officers and members of other ranks across the armed forces were invited to fill in a confidential questionnaire.
