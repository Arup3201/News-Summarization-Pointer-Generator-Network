Heartbreaking: Four-year-old Surranna Stonestreet was crushed to death after a garden wall which was believed to have been partially demolished by her father fell on top of her

A four-year-old girl was crushed to death after a garden wall which was believed to have been partially demolished by her father fell on top of her.

Surranna Stonestreet died under the weight of the falling debris just yards from where her father Karl was working at the family home in Bath.

Despite paramedics carrying out emergency-life support on the youngster on scene, she died shortly after arrival at hospital.

More than 100 people have now 
paid tribute to Surranna who died following the tragic accident at the family 
home in Haycombe Drive,Â  at 4pm on Friday.

Surranna's
devastated mother Nicola paid tribute to her little daughter on a 
Facebook page called 'Nicola & Surranna Stonestreet.'

She wrote: 'R.I.P baby ur going to b soooo missed ur were my world. Now sleeping with the angels love u darling XXXX'

A neighbour of Surranna confirmed the toddler's father Karl was 
demolishing a breeze block wall in his garden when she died.

The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Karl was out working in the garden, knocking down a wall.

'I don't know if it was a wall or maybe an old greenhouse foundations or something, but he was doing work.

'I went out about 4pm, and when I 
came back a couple of hours later, the garden was filled with people - 
they looked like police.'

The neighbour added that since the accident she has seen Karl getting rid of the remains of the wall.

She said: 'On Monday Karl and a 
couple of others moved all the breeze blocks to a pile at the bottom of 
the garden - I got the impression they just wanted rid of them.'

Surranna lived with her parents and three brothers and sisters in a 
semi-detached house in a quiet suburban estate - where their garden has a
trampoline and two garages.

The neighbour said: 'She was a lovely
sweet girl, it was such a tragedy. She was a tiny, cute blonde girl 
with big eyes and always smiling.

'Surranna and her sister used to ride their bikes down the path and crash into a fence, laughing and playing.

'I can't believe what happened - you read about it on the news but would never expect a tragedy like this to happen near you.

'It's such a shame, she seemed like such a lovely little girl.'

Ken Marks, who lives opposite the Stonestreet family, was one of the first people on the scene after the accident.

'I heard bad screams from across the road and one of the neighbours went into the house and came running out and told me to go,' he said.

'I went into the house and saw the little girl on the hallway floor.'

Mr Marks said that Mr Stonestreet was knocking down the wall, which is about 6ft high, because of concerns it was unsafe.

'He was hitting it with a hammer as the wall was unsafe and the children had not been down there,' he said.

'He was demolishing the wall and only hit it two or three times and it came away in a sheet and then all the bricks came apart.

'I wouldn't like to guess how heavy it was but it must have been a few tonnes.'

The South West Ambulance Service was called and operators gave instructions to carry out CPR until paramedics arrived. Surranna was then taken to the Royal United Hospital in Bath.

'I just stood there trying to console Karl,' Mr Marks said.

'It seemed like ages before the ambulance arrived but it was only four or five minutes.'

Mr Marks, who is a builder, said Mr and Mrs Stonestreet had three other children - two boys and a girl.

He added: 'I cannot believe it. It was so traumatic - it was unbelievable.

'It's been a devastating weekend - not just for me and the people there - but the whole community. They have been utterly devastated by it.

Tributes: Flowers have been left in the garden of the property where Surranna Stonestreet was killed by a falling wall

'You don't expect things like this to happen like this on your doorstep.

'I have not been able to sleep all weekend.

'The parents are traumatised. They are talking a little but are still traumatised.

'Karl is absolutely devastated by it.

'Nicola and Karl are smashing people. They are a happy family and the kids are always happy - smashing kids.'

An ambulance crew and paramedics arrived at the scene to find Surranna unconscious and not breathing.

They carried out CPR but she had suffered a cardiac arrest and she was taken to the Royal United Hospital in Bath.

Staff were standing by to receive her but she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

Another neighbour said: 'It was a great tragedy, such a terrible shame. I
don't know how the family are coping, I don't know how I would cope. It
is such a shame.'

The grieving parents were not at home this afternoon but 
Nicola's mother Lorraine was there looking after the children.

She was too upset to comment.

Friend Rosemary Evans also paid tribute on 
Facebook. She said: 'My words seem so empty at this time, Nicola, Karl 
and family, I'm so sorry for your tragic loss.

'Your sweet girl can fly with the angels now and one day she will come to welcome you "home" to be with her.

'I hope and pray that your hearts will be filled with love and peace and memories of your precious Surranna, at this time.'

John Oliver, spokesman for South West Ambulance Service, said a 999 call was received by the service at 3.39pm.

'The caller was reporting an incident involving a four-year-old girl. During the call it was reported that CPR was being carried out on the little girl by somebody at the scene.

'Early feedback was that the little girl had been crushed by a wall which had collapsed on her.

'Paramedics carried out advanced life-support on scene and this continued during the journey to hospital in Bath.'

Detective Sergeant Peter Knight, from Bath police, said: 'This incident has now been investigated. It appears to have been a tragic incident with no suspicious circumstances.'

A spokesman for Avon Coroner's Court said an inquest into the girl's death was likely to be opened later this week.

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset 
Constabulary said: 'We were called to an address in Haycombe Drive in 
Bath around 4pm on Friday to reports of an injured child.

'The girl was taken to the Royal United Hospital in Bath.'
