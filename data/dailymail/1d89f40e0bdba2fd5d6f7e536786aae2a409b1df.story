A senior News of the World journalist arrested over the phone hacking scandal claimed yesterday he had made secret recordings of his bosses.

Neville Thurlbeck, ex-chief reporter for the Sunday tabloid who is currently on police bail, claims to have compiled a large dossier of taped conversations and memos, which is now with his lawyers and proves phone hacking was ingrained in the culture of the paper.

Mr Thurlbeck also cast doubt on James Murdoch's insistence to the culture select committee that he was never told the full extent of illegal voicemail interceptions at the News of the World.

He claims the News International 
executive chairman was shown the crucial 'for Neville' email, which 
first made clear that journalists other than royal editor Clive Goodman,
jailed in 2007, were engaged in criminal activity.

Yesterday MP Tom Watson told the 
Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee that he had met with Mr 
Thurlbeck, and that he – like Mr Murdoch – insists that he was never 
shown the 'for Neville' e-mail, even though it bears his name and was 
apparently meant to be forwarded to him.

It emerged during a legal action taken
against the paper by Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon
Taylor. Mr Thurlbeck claims he pleaded with NI's former legal manager 
Tom Crone not to show it to Mr Murdoch because he feared he would lose 
his job as a result.

Detectives have been deluged with 300million emails handed over by News International.

The extraordinary amount of evidence was revealed as an outside police force recommended more officers be drafted in.

Initially the Operation Weeting team began with 45 detectives, there are now 118 working on the hacking inquiry and two associated investigations, at a cost of £3million in salaries alone.

Scotland Yard has arrested 17 people so far over the scandal.

But he says he could not persuade him,
and a week later Mr Crone allegedly confirmed to Mr Thurlbeck that he 
had shown it to his boss.

This would appear to contradict Mr 
Murdoch's testimony that he was never shown the e-mail. The evidence 
seized from Mr Thurlbeck's home by police is thought to include a 
recording of a conversation between him and Ross Hall, the junior NoW 
journalist who sent the e-mail. In the tape Hall is alleged to blame a 
senior NoW executive for commissioning the hacking of Mr Taylor.

Mr Thurlbeck, 50, has lodged a claim 
for unfair dismissal against News International. Among the large batch 
of recordings and memos which are with his lawyers, one tape is said to 
be of a NoW executive agreeing that Mr Thurlbeck had nothing to do with 
the hacking of Mr Taylor.

It is understood that Thurlbeck tried
to offer the tape to very senior NoW executives in April this year in a
bid to prove his innocence.

However,
they were said to have been 'very angry' that the paper's chief 
reporter was conducting his own inquiries, refused to collect the 
recording and told him to keep quiet.

The
revelation that Mr Taylor had been targeted dispelled News 
International's claims that phone-hacking was limited to rogue Royal 
reporter Clive Goodman, who was jailed over the affair.

Mr
Thurlbeck denied commissioning the voice-mail interception and it is 
believed that a recording and a memo that were found at his home may go 
some way to clear his name.

The
memo to the paper's former editor, Colin Myler, and the former head of 
legal, Tom Crone, is said to name other senior executives.

It is claimed that the message was sent in July 2009 before Parliament was told that hacking was restricted to a rogue reporter.

After his arrest Mr Thurlbeck claims 
to have been offered potential immunity from prosecution if he would 
testify against former colleagues. He refused because he thinks he will 
be exonerated.

Police allegedly made the approach after previous suggestions that Thurlbeck had passed information on crime to the police.

Court reports revealed Mr Thurlbeck was charged with corruption over his relationship with a National Criminal Intelligence Service detective.

But the men were acquitted in July 2000 and Mr Thurlbeck later said that the information he provided to police was applauded by the judge. Police have refused to discuss the role of informants.

The apparent move suggests that police are still gathering evidence in the investigation which could run for many more months.

Mr Thurlbeck, who has always insisted that he is innocent, said that he declined the offer. He told the Independent that he believed he would eventually be cleared.

He said: 'I have informed Scotland Yard that while I fully understand and respect the reason for their request of me to give evidence for the Crown in any prosecution arising from Operation Weeting, it is my opinion that a detailed and forensic inquiry into my working methods by what is a highly professional police unit will fully exonerate me. So... I have declined their offer.'

The latest evidence is believed to have emerged after officers from the Met raided Mr Thurlbeck's home earlier this year.
