Police have arrested a man they say killed three men on the streets of New York before casually strolling past two police commands in his getaway.

Roberto Nunez, 30, has been charged with one count of first-degree murder, three counts of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon after he was taken into custody at 8.15am today in the Bronx, police said on Saturday night.

Authorities say they linked Nunez to the June 7 executions outside Columbia University after an acquaintance sold a gun obtained by the suspect to an undercover cop that had the same shell casings inside the bodies of the dead men.

as it matched blood found on a shirt the suspect threw away nearby the 
scene, police said.

The suspect was arrested at a basement apartment leased by his brother on Morris Avenue in the Bronx.

His last known address was on College Avenue, also in the Bronx.

Nunez did not have a steady residence since the shooting as he moved around from home to home of friends and others since the shooting, according to the New York Post.

The suspect has a number of felony convictions, including robbery.

In a statement, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said: 'Detectives assigned to this case did a masterful job, relentlessly working it to apprehend a suspect who initially appeared so calm, collected, and out of reach.'

Video surveillance helped police identify the suspect as it shows a man 
in grey sweatpants and a white T-shirt, walking calmly after shooting 
his three victims execution style in a parked BMW in Manhattan over what
police suspect was a drug retaliation.

'He walked away, did not run,' NYPD Spokesman Paul Browne told the Wall Street Journal of the suspect.

Attracting just as little attention 
during the shooting, taking place around 5.30pm, the victims' bodies 
weren't discovered for at least another hour by a pedestrian.

With two men in the front seat and 
one in back, all were shot without bullet holes hitting the car, 
prompting investigators to initially believe the shooter was inside with
them.

Amaury Rodriguez, 31, Heriberto 
Suazo, 26, and Luis Catalan, 25, were shot multiple times in the skull 
and body, execution-style, at the Morningside Heights neighbourhood near
Columbia University.

The
men, discovered on Thursday evening near the Ivy League college, all 
had lengthy criminal records as they switched between robbing drug 
dealers or getting robbed by them.

The $88,000 car was parked near the intersection of W. 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue, between the Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church.

Authorities said they believe a gunman used a revolver to shoot the victims because no shell casings were found.

Police
said they believe the gunman first killed Catalan, sitting on the 
right, back seat, by shooting him in the left temple and side.

Then
driver Rodriguez died next followed by Suazo, who was sitting in the 
front passenger seat as they were both shot behind the ears.

Police believe the car had been parked for a maximum of an hour when it was discovered.

The high-end vehicle had temporary registration stickers and appeared to be stolen, according to the New York Daily News.

Catalan had been arrested at least 10 times for charges ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license, the Daily News reported.

Suazo was arrested late last year for
having 12 pounds of marijuana and loaded guns. Rodriguez served two 
years in state prison for gun charges, according to the Daily News.

No 911 calls were made to report any shootings and no students at the university claimed to hear any gunfire.

'This was a classic triple assassination,' said one source to the New York Post.’

'The shooter had to be a cool customer to kill three men so close to him. He was quick and deadly.'

One source told the Post that the attack, which happened during the day, was ‘a very bloody scene.

'Shooting three people in a car is extremely loud and the shooter may 
have used a silencer,' said a police source.

And 'he may have plugged 
his ears.'

Hours later, it was reported that 'blood was still dripping' from the car as it sat outside the university's Knox Hall.

Police blocked off a wide area around the triple homicide after the bodies were found.

‘Both men in the front seat were wearing white T-shirts, both drenched in blood,’ said a police spokesman.

The police were alerted around 6.30pm by a man walking by the scene who saw the two men in the front seat of the car appeared to be dead.

Sources told the Post that they weren’t believed to have been students of the music school or at Columbia.

Students in the area were badly shaken by the incident.

The area, which is full of students from several of the schools and universities around, is generally considered a very safe area of Manhattan.
