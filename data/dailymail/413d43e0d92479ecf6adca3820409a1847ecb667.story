Danny Williams went from a large bowl of spaghetti bolognaise to Commonwealth gold in six days on a golden night on the mat for England.

Williams, 25, was eating dinner a week ago when he got a phone call to inform him he was being called up to England’s judo squad.

‘I was eating a fairly large portion of spag bol and wholemeal garlic bread so I pushed that to one side and went down to the gym for the third time that day,’ he said.

Winner: Danny Williams of England won gold at the Commonwealth Games in the under-73kgs final

Strength: Williams won England's eighth gold medal of the Commonwealth Games on Friday

Williams had to almost starve himself 
and endure long sessions at the gym to shed the weight required to 
fight in the under 73kg category.

‘I
 was nowhere near the weight in all honesty,’ he said, ‘It’s been a very
 hard six days. I don’t think people see that side. If you don’t make 
the weight you don’t fight. I’m not going to say how much weight I had 
to lose but it was a lot, most people would have cried.

‘I
 did a lot of exercise before breakfast that sped my metabolism up. My 
carbohydrate intake was almost zero and all I was eating was six tiny 
saucers of food every day, drinking lots of water then starting the 
dehydration process. It wouldn’t normally have been so drastic.’

Williams,
 a sport coaching student at Anglia Ruskin University, was a late 
replacement for his injured team-mate Ben Fletcher. He defeated New 
Zealand judoka Adrian Leat by one Waza-ari score.

‘It
 feels incredible,’ he said, ‘I think the medal is just a bonus, the 
crowd were phenomenal. It could have been in England the way the crowd 
got behind me.’

Champion: England's Williams beat New Zealand's Adrian Leat in the under-73kg final in Glasgow

Confession: Williams says 'I'm not going to say how much weight I had to lose but it was a lot'

Williams 
greeted victory by ripping open his Gi (the jacket-like outfits worn by 
the judokas) to reveal his heavily-tattooed chest. Asked if he planned 
any more celebratory tattoos, he replied: ‘They’re all planned so 
there’s no more room.’

After
 the biggest victory of his career, Williams said he planned to 
celebrate with a ‘can of Fosters or maybe some Guinness’. He also paid 
tribute to his coach Luke Preston, who also coaches gold medallist 
Ashley McKenzie. ‘Luke brought me through,’ said Williams, ‘and I’m not 
the easiest person to deal with.’

There was also gold for Megan Fletcher who beat six-time Oceania champion Moira de Villiers of New Zealand.

And
 there was a bronze for Katie Yeats-Brown, who until a few days ago, 
planned to be at a local bowling alley last night. In fact she spent the
 early part of last night beating Canada’s Beatrice Valois to win a 
bronze medal.

She said: ‘I got the call on Tuesday morning at seven. I 
was quite annoyed because my mum said I could have a lie-in, then shook 
me awake and asked if I would like to fight at the Games. I thought my 
mum had lost the plot because selection was a couple of months ago.

‘But it was OK once I found out and obviously I’d choose a medal over Laser Quest.’

Bronze: Katie Yeats-Brown (in the blue) came third and said she got the call up at 7am on Tuesday
