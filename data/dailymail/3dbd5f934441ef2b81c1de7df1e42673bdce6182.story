A California couple who were left having to repay their daughter's crippling student loan debts when she died have revealed that they are finally debt free – five years after her untimely passing.

Lisa Mason died suddenly in 2010 of liver failure at the age of 27, leaving behind three children – now aged nine, 12 and 14.

As well as raising their grandchildren, Pastor Steve Mason, 59, and his wife Darnelle were saddled with $100,000 of debt because they had co-signed their daughter's loans for nursing school.

Because the money had been borrowed from a private lender, instead of the federal government, they had no way for the debt to be canceled. 

After four years, the  debt had doubled to $200,000 because of high interest rates and late-fee penalties but now thanks to the help of CNN Money, donations from strangers and the generosity of the family's lawyer they are finally celebrating being debt free.  

'We are just overwhelmed at the response,' said Darnelle. 'We can only hope that this wave [that the story] began will turn into a tsunami for all those other families that suffer as we do.'

Steve Mason, who earns $75,000 a year salary as pastor at Oasis Church in Redlands, California, was struggling to pay off $2,000 a month in debt as well as feed three children. 

The salary has wife earned as director at the same church wasn't helping either. 

Pastor Mason had appealed to the lenders for help, but the couple were told the only solution was to repay the mammoth loans - some of which had interest rates of 12 percent - in full.

Private lenders are not bound by federal regulations to provide assistance to those in financial difficulty - even when a family member has passed away.

The family was running out of options after discovering that they couldn't declare bankruptcy because student loan debts can't be forgiven.

In July, just as Mason was searching for a second job, CNN Money took up his case and suddenly things started to change. Senator Elizabeth Warren also highlighted the family's dire straits at a Banking Committee hearing.

Suddenly the loan companies that had refused to negotiate with Pastor Mason were shamed into leniency and have now forgiven more than $60,000 in outstanding debt.

The pastor also launched a GoFundMe page which has so far raised just over $41,000.

The remaining $100,000 debt has now been whipped thanks to the generosity of the family's attorney David Fine.

He has announced that he is waiving $100,000 in legal fees related to a lawsuit over Darnelle's death in a kind jesture to help the family pay off the rest.

'The tremendous emotional cost [of losing Lisa] was compounded by a sudden and colossal financial debt,' Fine told CNN Money. 

'Offering a portion of our fee to the Masons provides a small amount of comfort and security to a wonderful family.'

Money leftover from the settlement will now go directly to helping raise the Masons' grand kids.

Generosity for the family also came in other ways, for instance a local orthodontist has offered to give free braces to the Masons' grandkids, while they also received $750 worth of toys.

More than 210,000 people have also signed the family's Change.org petition urging lawmakers to require private student loan debt to be forgiven when the primary borrower dies.
