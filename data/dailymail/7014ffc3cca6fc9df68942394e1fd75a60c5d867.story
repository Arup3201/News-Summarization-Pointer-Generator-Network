A crocodile which killed a Filipino fisherman still had the body locked in the jaws of its mouth when coast guard workers stumbled across the gruesome discovery.

Workers shot the crocodile in an attempt to free the man, who was wedged between the jaws of its mouth while still dangling to a rope attached to his fishing vessel.

He was discovered on Thursday by the coast guard in the infested waters of the Rio Tuba river, about 710km from the capital of Manila.

'On the side of the boat was the body of the victim being bitten by a crocodile. The body was tied to the boat,' she said.

After firing at the crocodile, it released the body and escaped, but the man was already dead.

The fisherman was from a nearby village, and his death follows that of another man in the same region who was eaten in 2011 while gathering wood.

The body was recovered by villagers but the reptile escaped.
