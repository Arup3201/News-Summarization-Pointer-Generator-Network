President Obama last night claimed that the GOP had blocked 500 bills since 2007 as accusations of 'Republican obstructionism' are making an election-year comeback.

Obama and the Democratic Party have been forced onto the offensive as they try to explain to their big dollar donors why they've been unable to move forward on issues important to the base despite holding the upper chamber and the presidency.

'Their willingness to say no to everything — the fact that since 2007, 
they have filibustered about 500 pieces of legislation that would help 
the middle class just gives you a sense of how opposed they are to any 
progress,' President Barack Obama told attendees of a Democratic Party fundraiser on Wednesday evening at the home of Walt
 Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn in Los Angeles, California.

The President said Republicans' behavior 'has actually led to an increase in cynicism and 
discouragement among the people who were counting on us to fight for 
them.'

President Barack Obama listens to the remarks of movie director Steven Spielberg as he attends a USC Shoah Foundation event in L.A. on Wednesday night. Obama made remarks at Democratic Party fundraiser earlier in the evening, where he claimed Republicans had filibustered 500 bills in the last seven years

Obama is in California this week raising money for Democrats' re-election efforts. Last night's fundraiser was the first in a string of money-making events the president is shilling for his party at as they attempt to build up their war chest ahead of November's mid-term elections.

His '500 filibusters' remark likely came from claims Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been making this week.

'We’re now 
at more than 500 filibusters,' Reid said on Wednesday. 'They do 
everything they can to stop us from progressing in this country.'

Reid
 was was referring to the number of times bills he'd brought to the 
floor did not make it through the cloture process, a Senate staffer 
clarified on background, not the number of actual number of talk-a-thons Republicans 
have had throughout the last seven years.

A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell characterized it as the number times any bill introduced introduced by either party did not make it out of the Senate.

'To
 get to 500, you’d have to include all the times during the same time 
period that then-Sen. Obama voted to “filibuster” legislation and 
nominees, and all the times that Democrats "filibustered" Republican 
bills,' McConnell Communications Director Don Stewart told MailOnline in an email. 'It’s statements like 
those that keep fact checkers and late-night comedians in business.'

The National Republican Congressional Committee, the ideological counterpart to one of the groups Obama was campaign for on Wednesday, said it was the president who of standing in the way of legislation that would help Americans, not the other way around.

Maybe if President Obama spent less time jetting around the country for fancy fundraisers, and more time working with Congress, he could convince Democrats in the Senate to start voting on the dozens of jobs bill that House Republicans have passed and sent their way,' National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Andrew Clark told MailOnline.

'Voters have shown time and time again they are looking for a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda, but the Democrats in Congress are simply refusing to listen.'

Also in attendance at last night's Shoah Foundation was Honorary Chair and famed director Steven Spielberg, right. Spielberg as a major contributor to President Obama's re-election. He gave $1 million alone to a pro-Obama PAC the month before the November 2012 election

Throughout the 2012 presidential election, Obama referred to it as his 'last campaign' because U.S. presidents are limited to two terms in office.

Obama admitted at Wednesday's event that he recently realized that wasn't true and had to apologize to the First Lady for inadvertently misleading her about how much time he'd have to spend on politics in his second term.

'A couple months ago, I had to let her in on a secret, and that is, 
honey, I got one more campaign I got to run,' Obama said.

'I need to make sure we continue to have a 
Democratic Senate, and I need a Democratic House of Representatives in 
Washington.'

Both parties are desperate to win the Senate this year. If Republicans successfully grapple the upper chamber out of Democrats' hands, President Obama would quickly become a lame duck president.

'I've got to have a Democratic Senate,' President Obama told donors on Wednesday.

'And when you think about
everything I was able to accomplish with Nancy Pelosi at the helm in the House,
all the issues that you care about that we were able to advance when she was
the leader, I think you’ve got a big stake in making sure that we've got a
Democratic House as well,' he continued.

Republicans are not in danger of losing the House, and with control of the Senate, too, they could effectively halt the president's agenda during his final two years in office.

Depending on how many seats Republicans pick up in the Senate, the president could go from playing offense on issues important to progressives to playing defense.

No more threatening to use his pen and phone - President Obama's only remedy to Republican-led initiatives would be to use his veto authority to send legislation back to the House and Senate, where it would take a super majority to overturn his decision.

Obama could also move his agenda though executive orders, something he has not been shy about doing in the past.

Obama took a break from fundraising to attend the dinner, where he received an award from the Spielberg, who created the foundation

Republicans are equally aware of what is at stake in November.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell fired back on the Senate floor on Thursday that the way Senate Democrats are acting is 'disgraceful.'

'Instead of a forum for debate and resolution of the most pressing domestic and international issues facing our nation, it’s become fodder for late-night TV,' McConnell charged.

'When the American people turn on C-SPAN these days, they don’t often see a Majority Party driving serious debate on the issues of the day. They hear bizarre monologues about greased pigs and a couple of Kansans the Majority Leader seems to see around every corner. They see a daily display of absurd political theater that has almost no relevance at all to their daily lives,'  the Minority Leader, who races a rocky road to reelection this year himself, continued.

McConnell was referring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's barrage of attacks against conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, who are from Kansas, and his claims that GOP Senators are obstructing legislation at the Koch's behest.

A poll recently showed that few Americans know who the Koch Brothers are, but name dropping the activists on the Senate floor has proven to be lucrative for Democrats.

The president's number likely includes every single piece of legislation that has come through the Senate in that time - including legislation Democrats opposed, a Senate staffer said

Republicans are in turn calling on Democrats to stop obstructing Republican-led legislation from coming to the Senate floor
