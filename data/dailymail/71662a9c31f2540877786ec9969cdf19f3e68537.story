A mother has described the moment she saw her daughter's finger 'hanging off' after a pushchair closed on it.

Emily Booth needed surgery to remove part of her finger and had to have a metal plate inserted after her finger was sliced off in the mechanism.

Her mother, Amanda, is now considering taking legal action against Mothercare which sold the buggy.

Amanda, 21, said: 'Emily started screaming - I pulled the pushchair back up into place and realised her finger was hanging off.

'It was awful, there was blood everywhere.'

Emily was rushed to a medical centre on Higher Hillgate in Stockport, and then taken in an ambulance to the town’s Stepping Hill Hospital.

The 20-month-old was then transferred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, where Amanda was told Emily would need surgery.

The operation took place the following day.

Amanda, from Marple, said: 'The staff at Stepping Hill tried putting butterfly stitches in, but it didn’t work, and they told me I would have to take her to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.

'She had to be put under general anaesthetic, which was really scary. The whole thing has been a really distressing experience for both of us.'

After making an initial complaint to Mothercare about its Nanu stroller, Amanda has now instructed a solicitor.

She added: 'I just want to make people aware of what happened so it doesn’t happen to anyone else.'

A spokesman from Mothercare said the company ‘have requested, and would greatly welcome, to see the pushchair and receive further information from the family as to how the accident occurred’.

However, Amanda says she is unwilling to send the pushchair back in case she needs it to make a claim.

The Mothercare spokesman added: 'The 
safety of our customers and their families is our number one priority 
and we are taking this matter very seriously.

Mothercare: Company say no other accidents of this kind had been reported in two and a half years

'We were extremely concerned and offered our deep regret to hear of this accident.

'We continue to offer our full ongoing support, care and assistance to the customer and their family.

'We would like to better understand what may have caused this accident and wish to carry out a full and thorough investigation as quickly as possible.'

Mothercare said no other accidents of this kind had been reported in the two and a half years the stroller has been on sale, and it has a primary and secondary locking system tested in line with European Safety Standards.
