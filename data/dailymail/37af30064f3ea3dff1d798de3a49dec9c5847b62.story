This boxing orangutan is ready for a rumble in the jungle.

And who can blame him - the annoying monkey facing him keeps stealing his banana.

These hilarious photographs show the youngster wrestling with a cheeky long-tailed macaque as they try to dine on a feeding platform.

It happened at Gunung Leuser National Park on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

The orangutan was with its mother who, incredibly, was once kept as a pet before being released into the wild.

Despite being fighting fit, he still needs the odd food handout from his keepers, and doesn't appreciate it when the other animals monkey around.

The Sumatran orangutan lives among the trees of tropical rainforests.

Females almost never travel on the ground and adult males only do so rarely. Adult males are typically solitary while females are accompanied by offspring.

In Sumatra, around 80 per cent of the native forest has already been destroyed.

The loss of natural habitat, along with illegal hunting, has left the Sumatran orangutan critically endangered.

Of the nine existing populations of Sumatran orangutans, only seven have prospects of long-term viability, each with an estimated 250 or more individuals.

Only three populations contain more than 1,000 orangutans. Humans share 96 per cent of their genes with orangutans.
