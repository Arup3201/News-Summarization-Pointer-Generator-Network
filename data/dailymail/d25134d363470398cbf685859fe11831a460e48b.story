Law enforcement officials in Rochester New York say colleagues of convicted pedophile Matthew LoMaglio were uncooperative during the investigation.

LoMaglio, 37, an elementary school gym teacher, was convicted last month of sexually molesting an eight-year-old boy between 2006 and 2007.

Many teachers and administrators who had worked with LoMaglio, who was sentenced last week to four years prison for second degree sexual conduct against a child and endangering the welfare of a child, refused to speak to investigators.

Supported: Matthew LoMaglio, 37, had the support of many staff members from his Rochester, New York school, despite the accusation he molested a second-grader - a crime he was later convicted of

According to EAG News, 22 of LoMaglio's co-workers wrote to the judge in support of the teacher during the case, some of whom said they would trust him with their own children and others who said they considered him a good role model for kids.

The community was surprised and disappointed by the support of LoMaglio and lack of sympathy for the young victim.

'Some of the people [on the school staff] who were cooperative told us there was talk at school, sort of like ‘Are you for the teacher or for the student,’” Kyle Rossi, the assistant district attorney who tried the case against LoMaglio, told EAGnews. 'It was very disappointing to make contact with teachers who wouldn’t give us the time of day until they were instructed to.

'I would say that, being in that position, they have a special duty to recognize issues and protect kids. I would think it has more do to with ignorance than anything else.'

The victim told his mother he had nightmares about being raped by his gym teacher, LoMaglio.

The mother approached the school about her son's growing fear of gym class and the unsettling descriptions of his dreams.

Susan Hasenaur-Curtis, the assistant principal at School 19 at the time, testified in court that she met with the second-grader and his mother to discuss the issue but she didn't report the case to Child Protective Services because she did not believe there was credible evidence of abuse.

The abuse finally came to light when the boy's brother found a letter in his bedroom in 2012, explaining how he had been abused by LoMaglio and another sibling showed it to the boys' parents.

But building a case against the teacher was difficult when many close to the case who knew both the boy and the teacher refused to speak.

'Reprehensible': Prosecutor Kyle Rossi says the actions of LoMaglio's colleagues in supporting him and ignoring the victim were inexcusable

Silence: Many staff members at the Rochester school where LoMaglio taught refused to speak to investigators and prosecutors

'I would say that many teachers and administrators at several schools where this guy had taught wouldn’t talk to us at all,' Rossi told EAG News. 'We ran into cold shoulders all the way around. They would say things like ‘nothing happened here’ and ‘I don’t know anything, I don’t want to talk about anything.

'One person even told a police investigator "Don’t call me again." Some were even rude.'

According to Fox News, LoMaglio maintained his innocence during the trial but during sentencing acknowledged his guilt to a counselor.

'They would say this never could have happened,' Rossi said. 'This is why children don’t disclose sexual abuse, because they believe the people who can help them won’t believe them. I found it reprehensible that teachers would behave this way.

'To have so many teachers come out in favor of a man who admitted he did this, it was terrible to see. Who can a kid go to?'
