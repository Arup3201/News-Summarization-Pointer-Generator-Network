Shamed baseball star Alex Rodriguez hits one of his 54 home runs  during the 2007 after being given special permission to use testosterone

Banned baseball star Alex Rodriguez was granted special permission to use performance-enhancing testosterone during the 2007 season, it has emerged.

Rodriguez, who enjoyed a career high in 2007 scoring a major-league leading 54 home runs, was handed a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to use testosterone, just two days before the start of spring training.

The shamed Yankees star is suspended from playing this season while he serves a 211 game suspension for using performance enhancing drugs including testosterone and human growth hormone over the course of several seasons.

He also failed a steroid test in 2003.

Details of the 2007 exemption emerged in the transcript of a grievance hearing held in August last year when Rodriguez unsuccessfully appealed the 211-game ban, according to a new book, Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era.

According to the book Rodriguez, 38, was one of two players who were granted TUEs for androgen deficiency medications at the start of the 2007 season.

Testosterone, which has been banned by baseball since 2003, was described by Major League Baseball's chief operating officer Rob Manfred as 'the mother of all anabolics'.

Mr Manfred is quoted in the book as saying exemptions for the substance are 'very rare,' adding: 'some people who have been involved in this field feel that with a young male, healthy young male, the most likely cause of low testosterone requiring this type of therapy would be prior steroid abuse'.

The hearing transcript also revealed that Rodriguez applied for a further two exemptions in 2008 and was given permission to use the drug Clomid which is prescribed to men suffering from hypogonadism.

However he was denied permission to use 
human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a testosterone-producing drug which 
is sometimes used for weight loss.

MLB officials said in a statement: 'All decisions regarding whether a player shall receive a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) under the Joint Drug Program are made by the Independent Program Administrator (IPA) in consultation with outside medical experts, with no input by either the Office of the Commissioner or the Players Association.Â

'The process is confidentially 
administered by the IPA, and MLB and the MLBPA are not even made aware 
of which players applied for TUEs.

'The TUE process under the Joint Drug Program is comparable to the process under the World Anti-Doping Code.

'The standard for receiving a TUE for a medication listed as a performance-enhancing substance is stringent, with only a few such TUEs being issued each year by the IPA. MLB and the MLBPA annually review the TUE process to make sure it meets the most up-to-date standards for the issuance of TUEs.'

While the Yankees failed to qualify for the World Series in 2007, Rodriguez enjoyed a standout season being voted Most Valuable Player by a landslide and becoming at 32, the youngest player in history to hit 500 home runs.

He smashed a total of 54 home runs, drove in 156 runs and scored 143.

He was subsequently signed to a 10-year deal with the Yankees worth at least $275 million with further $6 million bonuses for every all-time home run leader's record he broke starting with Willie Mays at 660 and ending with Barry Bonds at 762.

The deal made him the richest man in baseball by a wide margin.

His current net worth is valued at $300m.

He was banned last year after it emerged he had been been receiving banned Human Growth Hormone from Florida anti-aging clinic Biogenesis of America.

He was one of 13 players suspended for their roles in the scandal.
