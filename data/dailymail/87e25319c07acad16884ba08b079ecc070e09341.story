This is the second time that Joe Longthorne, pictured, has battled against cancer

Singer and impressionist Joe Longthorne yesterday revealed he is battling throat cancer.

The 58-year old, who beat leukaemia in 2006, will have surgery in the next few days and vowed: ‘I’ve been here before, so here we go, round two coming up.’

Longthorne’s battle against illness began in 1989 when he was diagnosed with lymphoma. It developed into leukaemia but he won his fight against the disease after he had a bone marrow transplant in 2006. But this year he found a lump in his throat and surgeons will operate after the weekend.

Longthorne, who was awarded an MBE for services to charity in 2012, vowed to carry on his UK tour while he could and said his Catholic faith would help him beat the illness again.

In a statement the Blackpool-based star said: 'I was completely and utterly shocked at being given the news about having to have treatment for throat cancer. However, I am 100 per cent positive.

'I've been here before, so here we go, round two coming up. You have two choices on being given news like this, you can stay down or get up and fight.

'I've always chosen to fight and fight on I will. I've beaten it before and will do so again.

'There are always people much worse of than yourself so it's important to keep focused at this time.

'I have the most wonderful family one could ever have, some very dear friends and the best fans anyone could ever wish for. I have had their love and total support all through my life and they have and always will be there for me.'

He said: 'I would like to say to my fans at this time to think of my charities and give their support if they can.

'After receiving the MBE in 2012 I have given much more time and attention to helping others and I would like to ask my fans to do this too and they will be helping me on the way. We are like one big family these days as I like it.

'Obviously with being a vocalist I am taking each day one day at a time and will remain positive and resolute about the outcome, I am a Catholic and have my faith and deep belief in Jesus Christ, he has seen me through before and he will be there for me this time.'
