Joshua R. Hensler, social media manager at US Airways, calls himself a 'web alchemist' and 'aggressive engineer of perception' on his LinkedIn profile.

His boasts will be taken in a very different light today as he emerged as a manager at the US Airways social media team behind what has been branded the 'worst tweet of all time'.

An employee sparked a firestorm on Twitter yesterday after an extremely graphic picture of a woman engaged in a sex act with a model Boeing 777 was tweeted to a customer who complained about her Spring Break flight - and to its 418,000 followers.

'Web alchemist' and 'aggressive engineer of perception': Joshua R. Hensler, the social media manager at US Airways has apparently called the employee responsible a 'giant a**hole'

Graphic: US Airways has apologized after their official Twitter account tweeted an extremely inappropriate photo (which MailOnline has blanked over) on Monday afternoon

It quickly became one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter - a dream for any social media manager. But for Hensler it wasn't the 'perception engineering' he had in mind.

While it is not yet known which employee was behind the monumental error, Hensler apparently had some choice words for him or her.

Reacting today in the only way he would - on social media - he posted on Facebook: 'Whenever someone says: "I'm sorry, it's just who I am." What they really mean is: "I am a giant a**hole and have no plans of improving myself as a human"'.

He has since deleted the message from his public profile.

This was hours after he posted, in a huge understatement: 'I've seen better days'.

Hensler, who works out of the airline's headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, was unavailable for comment.

But a spokesman for USAirways' partner American Airlines said Hensler had no involvement with the incident and was not managing the team. The spokesman claimed the Facebook messages were unrelated.

The 30-year-old, who says on Facebook he is in an open relationship, went to Westminster College in Pennsylvania, and boasts on his LinkedIn profile that he is the 'Captain of Crunch Time' and his responsibilities include being part of the Crisis and Communications Response Team.

Those skills will be sorely needed now.

US Airways has had to profusely apologize for the mistake which has spawned a torrent of puns mocking the airline online. Today, the airline said it will not fire the employee, adding that it was an 'honest mistake' and and an 'attempt to flag the tweet as inappropriate'.

'We captured it, flagged it as inappropriate,' a spokesman for the airline said. 'We are in the midst of reviewing our processes but for the most part we have an understanding of what happened and how to ensure how it won't happen in the future.'

It all started when the image was initally posted to the USAirways Twitter stream by a user. It was flagged as inappropriate by the team that manages their Twitter account.

But then a young woman, Alex, tweeted directly to US Airways early on Monday morning that her flight to Portland had been delayed - demanding 'free stuff' because her vacation was off to a bad start.

In reply, the airlines official Twitter account replied, 'We don’t like to hear this, Alex.  Please provide feedback to our Customer Relations team here,' and attached the explicit photograph of the nude woman out to its followers 'by accident'.

US Airways said: 'We apologize for an
 inappropriate image recently shared as a link in one of our responses. 
We’ve removed the tweet and are investigating.'

The
 tweet was deleted but spent 22 minutes online - enough time to cause a 
frenzy of sharing among incredulous users of the social media app.

Incredulous: The public's reaction to US Airways staggering tweet ranged from humor to sympathy for whoever was responsible

The replies to the offensive tweet ranged from laughter to outrage.

The image in question was attached to a
 tweet sent to @AmericanAir at 1:59PM, 30 minutes before US Airways sent
 out a tweet with the same image attached.  American Airlines and US 
Airways use the same social media tool, SNAP100.

The
 timing was particularly amusing since it overlapped with the 
announcement of the Pulitzer Prize winners and gained more traffic 
online.

The tweet is 
even more embarrassing for US Airways as they prepare for their merger 
with American Airlines which will create the world's largest airline 
company.

Help! Hensler boats he is part of the crisis response team at US Airways
