Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid revealed today that he may permanently lose sight in his right eye as a result of an accident that took place at his Nevada home on New Year's Day while he was exercising but is 'very hopeful' he'll fully recover.

'This isn’t anything that is a slam dunk,' he told Las Vegas public radio station KNPR during an interview. 'I had a serious injury in my eye. There was some blood accumulation there and they’re hoping it resolves itself.'

Reid traveled to Washington this week with plans to return to work on Tuesday when Congress began anew but wasn't able to leave his house on doctor's orders. He'll continue to work from home next week, he said today, as his face continues to heal.

'I’m just following their orders. It’s a day-to-day deal.'

A former boxer, 75-year-old Reid still works out every day. 

On Jan. 1 he suffered a concussion after the resistance band he was training with hit him in the face and knocked him off his feet. The fall caused him to break three ribs in addition to multiple facial bones and landed him a nasty black eye. 

Not one to give up easily, the Democratic senator flew to Washington, D.C. over the weekend with the intention of joining his colleagues on Capitol Hill this week.

His office announced on Tuesday that he would not come to Senate after all, however, on the advice of his doctors.

Unable to go to work, Reid brought the work to him. The top Democrat held meetings with his staff and leadership team at his home and his office sent out statements on his behalf on major legislative initiatives.

'Senator Reid has spoken with President Obama multiple times since his injury and will continue to keep a busy schedule in the coming days,' the senator's communications director, Adam Jentleson, said in a statement on Tuesday. 

Appearing in a YouTube video that same day, a bandaged Reid said, 'Most people know I fought [boxed] for a couple of years. After any one of those fights, I never looked like I do now.'

Reid joked that he didn't get his black eye from famed Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao or from bull riding or riding a motorcycle.

'I was exercising in my new home,' he said. 'The doctors have told me I'd better take it easy.' 

Meanwhile, at the Capitol, Reid's No. 2, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, supervised the Democratic caucus in the Nevada senator's stead.

'I think I’ve done a good job directing my crew without me actually being physically present at the Capitol,' Reid told KNPR today, according to the Washington Examiner.

Reid told the radio station that his limited vision has caused him to rely more heavily on staff at present.

The longtime lawmaker said the incident will have no lasting effects on his ability to do his job and that he still plans to run for reelection in 2016 when his current term is up.

'I’ve always been very confident in my ability to fight back, and I'm going to continue to fight back,' he said.

'I've been set back a little bit but I’m in the process of getting setup for the next go-around.'

The septuagenarian pointed out that he's likely in better shape than most of the radio program's listeners.

'I don’t know how many people out there could sit down and do 250 pushups or do the strength exercise I did with those bands hundreds and hundreds of times — hundreds of times — every week, three times a week,' Reid said. 

'So no one has to question my physical ability.'

After the interview, Reid's spokesman reiterated how tough the senator is on twitter by sharing his workout regimen.

'To recap Sen. Reid's exercise routine: 250 SITUPS 3x/wk (750 total). Arm & chest: 420 reps w/exercise band 3x/wk. Walks 3 mi/day. Plus yoga,' Jentleson said.
