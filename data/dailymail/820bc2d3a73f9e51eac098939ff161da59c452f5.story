Three men, aged between 45 and 50, were arrested after police found them with nearly 1,100 illegally captured and mutilated frogs in Cantal, central France

A poaching gang are facing up to a year in jail and a £12,500 fine after they were allegedly caught slicing limbs off wild frogs and selling them to chefs.

Three French men, aged between 45 and 50, were arrested after police found them with nearly 1,100 illegally captured and mutilated frogs.

The men, who are all from Landeyrat, Cantal, France, had been equipped with professional traps and cages filled with the endangered species which they had been catching in wetland areas.

They had planned to supply the frogs’ legs – a local delicacy in France – to chefs in the country's Auvergne region.

Chefs are said to pay about £7 for a dozen pairs of home-grown frogs’ legs – which they usually serve with garlic and parsley.

Police said the illegal frogs seized from the poaching gang would have been worth around £400 on the black market.

Frogs’ legs, known as Cuisses de Grenouille, are so popular as a food in France that conservative estimates say up to 100 million pairs of frogs’ legs are eaten every year.

The amphibians have been a protected species in France for more than 20 years, after the government ordered a ban on the hunting of them in the wild, and 99 per cent of the frogs’ legs consumed annually are imported.

However, huge demand for the delicacy has led to several illegal poaching operations – although police said the most recent gang to be arrested were the ‘most prolific’ and ‘best organised’.

Detectives arrested the trio following a long operation in which they used surveillance to catch the alleged poachers red-handed.

Frogs’ legs, known as Cuisses de Grenouille, is a popular dish in France and it is estimated up to 100 million are eaten every single year. However, 99 per cent of the frogs’ legs consumed annually are imported

Officers found up to 1,100 captured frogs and wooden blocks and cleavers – used to chop them up – in disused farm buildings in Cantal, central France.

Local police officer, Major Patrick Soubrier, told France’s Le Parisien newspaper: ‘It’s a first on this scale in Cantal, with this type of equipment and people who are clearly regulars at this.

‘We found protected species and non-protected ones. They were harvesting whatever they could.’
