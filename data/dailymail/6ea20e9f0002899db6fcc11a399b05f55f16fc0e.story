Mr Ricketson worked with disabled children in Sydney and had been travelling through south east Asia for a few weeks.

His family took to Facebook in the hours after his death to post heartfelt tributes. 

'He was an ever kind, sweet, loving and patient man, and talking to him in recent weeks it was clear that these traits had only deepened with all that he had seen and experienced,' his sister Ella said.

'We as a family are all grieving, but we are still completely shocked and finding it hard to believe that our boy could be gone.

'Tonight my family's world was shattered in a way that we all dread more than anything else.'

Mr Ricketson spent 10 days with his uncle James Ricketson in Cambodia's capital city, Phnom Penh, prior to his death.

'Tom is no longer with us - other than in our heats and our memories,' James said.  

'Tom was a sweet, gentle, kind, loving and generous young man whose shyness hid a gold mine of generosity towards his fellow human beings.

'Tom revealed this aspect of himself to me recently in Phnom Penh when he came with me to visit a very poor community and was so moved by their plight that he was thinking about what he could do to help alleviate the worst aspects of the poverty these people experienced.' 

Police have notified the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh and are contining to investigate. 

The Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance to Mr Ricketson's family.
