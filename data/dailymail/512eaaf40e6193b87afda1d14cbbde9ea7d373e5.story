The victim is recovering in the Gold Coast University Hospital, along with his alleged attacker, who sought treatment for an injury that occurred earlier in the evening.

The two men were socialising together earlier on Saturday night when an argument erupted, a police spokeswoman told AAP.

She said the pair may have smashed through a window or glass door, causing the injuries to the younger man.

Neither man had any links to outlaw motorcycle gangs.

The younger man has been charged with assault occasioning bodily harm and will appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on Monday.
