The distressing collision happened n the last play of the first half during a tense game against Tulsa

Tulsa was leading 35-3 and facing a 
fourth-and-2 with the ball at the 33-yard line when the Golden Hurricane
called timeout. Tulane then called timeout.

When play resumed, Tulsa quarterback Cody Green tossed a short pass to Willie Carter, who caught it at about the 28, and turned upfield.

He was tackled around the 18-yard line, with defensive tackle Julius Warmsley and Walker sandwiching him and apparently smashing the crowns of their helmets into each other.

Medical personnel from both teams came out about 12.37 pm to attend to Walker as he lay on the field.

Walker stopped breathing as emergency medical workers were removing his jersey and shoulder pads.Â 

They administered CPR and fluids and performed a tracheotomy as he lay limp on the field.

At
about 12.52 pm, Walker was lifted onto a stretcher and loaded into a 
waiting ambulance about two minutes later.

The ambulance drove off the 
field about 1 pm and he was taken to Saint Francis Hospital.

FOX Sports reported that a hush went over
the crowd at H.A. Stadium as Walker was attended to on the field.

Several coaches were in tears.

Spectators bowed their heads as someone on the field led the stadium in prayer.

The game resumed at 1:20 pm.

Walker is a senior majoring in cell 
and molecular biology. His brother, Raynard, told The Associated Press 
that their mother was watching the game on television when her son was 
injured.

The family was waiting for an update on Walker's condition, he said.

'We haven't heard much at all,' he added. 'We're still kind of in the dark right now.'

Tulane head coach Curtis Johnson told
a FOX Sports sideline TV reporter after the 45-10 loss that he hadn't 
received an update on Walker's condition, but said the injury had 
devastated his team.

'Mood in the locker room was somber. Definitely one of the most difficult times,' he said.

'He's one of us, and he's a good kid.'
