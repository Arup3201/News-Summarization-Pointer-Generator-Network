Nearly half of British men are clueless when it comes to their wife or girlfriend’s dress size, according to a survey.

The poll found that 46 per cent of husbands and boyfriends have little idea about their partner’s measurements.

Only 28 per cent were able to recall their partner’s bra size and less than two thirds knew her shoe size.

Sized up: Only 46 per cent of British men said they knew their partner's dress size and only 28 per cent had an idea of her bra size

Three in ten were unaware of their 
wife or girlfriend’s favourite perfume and 12 per cent did not know 
their favourite food choices.

More
than one in ten respondents had no clue about their partner’s favourite
musician or band, whereas five per cent could not recall their 
anniversary.

A somewhat useless one per cent of the 600 male respondents surveyed were unable to recall their partner’s birthday.

However,
an overwhelming majority, a full 73 per cent, felt it was not important
to know that they knew things like their partner’s dress or shoe size.

For 92 per cent of men the most important thing they knew about their wife or girlfriend was what made her happy.

Safe choice: Although chips is always a safe bet for a welcome dinner, only 12 per cent of men knew what their wife or girlfriend's favourite dish

One
male respondent said: ‘I hate shopping for clothes, in fact I spend 
most of the time checking the football results while my girlfriend drags
me round the shops. It’s no wonder I haven’t got a clue about what her 
dress size is.

‘I don’t even
know what bra size she is - every time we go into lingerie section I go
bright red and don’t know where to look. I spend most of the time with 
my eyes firmly fixed on the floor.’

Another
man said: ‘As far as I’m concerned, knowing your partner’s favourite 
perfume is essential - this means her Christmas and birthday presents 
are sorted for at least the next five years.

‘I don’t know what dress size my girlfriend is, but if she asked me, I’d always opt for a size smaller than I actually think.’

A spokeswoman for discount shopping website PromotionalCodes.org.uk said: ‘It may not seem important to men, but if your husband or boyfriend can’t even recall the most basic facts about you, it’s pretty hurtful.

‘The main thing it shows is that he doesn’t listen to you and listening to one another is the bedrock of any relationship.

‘I can forgive a guy for not knowing my dress size as in fairness they differ from one shop to the next, but not knowing my birthday is inexcusable.’
