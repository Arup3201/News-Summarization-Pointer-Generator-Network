A controversial Northern Virginia CEO was arrested Tuesday and faces charges he brutally beat and strangled his estranged wife then hung her from a ceiling to make it look like a suicide.

Police say Braulio Castillo, who came under intense fire last summer after his company allegedly bilked the IRS out is seen in surveillance footage entering Michelle Castillo's posh Ashburn home March 19 just before she arrived home. She had a protective order against her husband.

Castillo reportedly exited the home alone after midnight March 20 then returned the next morning and asked a neighbor to go inside and findÂ  her after their four young children were unable to find their mother and called him over.

The neighbor was initially unable to find Michelle Castillo and called police after sensing something was amiss.

'That
 was certainly suspicious,' Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman told NBC
 Washington. 'When he left with the children, the neighbor didn't feel 
things were right and it was the neighbor who called the sheriff's 
office and we responded and ultimately found her hanging in the 
bsasement bathroom downstairs.'

It was not long before investigators revealed it was not a suicide.

'The
 evidence shows she was beaten and suffocated before she was found 
hanging in the downstairs bathroom,' Chapman said. 'That hanging was not
 the cause of her death.'

Divorcing: Michelle Castillo had five children with her husband and had accused him of beating and threatening her in the past. She had an order of protection against Castillo at the time of the murder and they were in the middle of a nasty divorce

Surveillance: Castillo is allegedly seen in a neighbor's surveillance footage entering Michelle's Ashburn, Virginia home just before Michelle arrived. He then left the home alone just after midnight on March 20

Sad: A neighbor's surveillance footage reportedly shows Castillo entering Michelle's home despite his restraining order and leaving hours later on March 20. He would later ask a neighbor to look for her in the home after the children called him to say they couldn't find their mother

The divorcing couple was slated to appear in court the day before her murder, according to Leesburg Today.

NBC
 Washington reports that in the past Michelle had accused her CEO 
husband of physical abuse and of making threats leading up to their 
separation.

'[He] wakes 
me up at 2:30 in the morning yellling, pointing his finger in my face 
and telling me not to talk to my friends about him,' Michelle said 
according to court filings. 'He also says that if I keep doing it, he is
 just going to crash this plane and sink this ship.'

Grilled: Castillo was grilled in 2013 by the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee over his friendship with an IRS contracting official which investigators said led to his company winning $500 million in government contracts

'Regarding our company or our marriage or our life,' she wondered.

The answer may have become all too clear.

Castillo's past troubles with the government revolved around his close ties to IRS contracting official Gregory Roseman.

A
 House of Representatives reports accused him and his company Strong 
Castle with using that friendship to win some $500 million in business 
from the federal agency.
