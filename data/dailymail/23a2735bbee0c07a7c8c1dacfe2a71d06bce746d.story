A lorry driver has been arrested after a head-on collision in County Durham today which left three people from the same family dead - including a one-year-old baby girl.

All three killed were from the same car, a 75-year-old man, believed to be the driver, an 18-year-old girl who was rear seat passenger and a one-year-old baby who was in the rear of the vehicle.

A 74-year-old woman, who was a front seat passenger of the Renault Megane Scenic, is still being treated for what were described as life-threatening injuries at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

Carnage: Three members of the same family, including a on-year-old baby, who were in this car, were killed following a head-on collision with a lorry today

Wreckage: The Renault Scenic people carrier carrying four members of the same family - three of whom were killed - was devastated by the impact on the B1404

The driver of the Volvo truck, a 42-year-old man, from Hetton-Le-Hole, was treated for whiplash and arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, police said.

He is currently in police custody.

The accident happened near Sharpley Golf Club on the B1404 between Houghton-le-Spring and Seaham at around 12.20pm, Durham Police said.

The force of the crash sent the lorry through a fence and on to the 15th fairway, 250 metres from the impact.

‘The road has been closed to traffic and is expected to be so for several hours,’ he added.

Simon Weightman, a farmer who diversified to build Sharpley Golf Club, said: ‘I suddenly saw a lorry in the middle of the fairway.

‘Then I saw a person get out and collapse on the ground.

‘Some golfers playing that hole turned out to be detectives and they were very quickly on the scene of the crash.

‘The bang was so loud I thought it must have been a head-on collision.

‘The lorry's fuel tank was ruptured as if the lorry had gone over the car.

‘I got a quick glimpse of the car but it was very traumatic to see it.

‘Golfers who saw it came off the course. They could clearly see it was awful.’

Mr Weightman said the crash happened on a 60mph stretch of road, close to the bottom end of the course.

He
said: ‘After the collision it had gone through the old hedge, through 
the new one, up an embankment, over the top of some five-year-old trees 
and into the fairway.

Tragic: The force of the collision was so violent the lorry carried on hundreds of yards off the road on to Sharpley Golf Club, County Durham

‘Fuel was running out of its tank.

‘The front of the lorry was damaged and the tyres were ruptured.

‘The driver of the lorry only seemed to get 30 yards from the vehicle and then collapsed.’

Mr Weightman said there had been several bad crashes on the stretch of road since he moved to the farm in 1989 and it was the third time the air ambulance has attended.

‘There has been a lot of vehicles go through the hedge and that has generally been associated with speed.

‘We really should have a 50mph limit here,’ he said.

A spokesman for the Great North Air Ambulance confirmed they were called to the scene at 12.25pm.

He said a female casualty was taken to James Cook University Hospital with serious injuries.
