Serving the aristocrats of Blenheim Palace had been the work of the Hine family for generations.

And while Sir Winston Churchill’s fate in the First World War became renowned, the remarkable story of one of his lowly clerk’s has remained undisclosed.

Young estate clerk Arthur Hine became the spy for Sir Winston - the First Lord of the Admiralty and later battalion commander on the Western Front - after volunteering to go to the front line in 1914.

Sergeant Hine left his job at Blenheim, the home of the Duke of Marlborough and the Spencer-Churchill family in Oxfordshire, where his work involved ‘drawing plans and plotting land’.

It was during training camps at the palace, where Sir Winston was born, that the pair met and Hine was chosen to be his ‘eyes and ears’. 

When the Siege of Antwerp broke out in October 1914, Sir Winston was sent to personally assess the damage as part of his duty as First Lord of Admiralty.

Hine was dispatched to the Belgian city as a ‘dispatch rider message carrier’ and motorcycled through Antwerp while it was being bombarded by Germany as he gathered information for the intelligence department.

Military historian, Chris Baker, said that during the war Hine had been attached to the future prime minister's parliamentary private secretary.

‘I don’t think there is much doubt that Arthur was given some kind of special mission,’ he said.

During the siege he helped a Belgian girl from a burning cellar where her parents had both been killed and took her back to England to live with his family.

Hine survived the war, suffering shellshock, but never returned to Blenheim.

His story was uncovered by Lord Julian Fellowes, the creator of Downton Abbey, in a new television programme about how the First World War affected Blenheim Palace.

The writer delved into the archives to find out the war stories of a ‘real’ Downton Abbey from those who lived both upstairs and downstairs.

In the programme he meets with a relative of Hine who had no idea about her ancestor’s heroic past. 

Life for the noblemen and 80 servants at Blenheim Palace, which was built in 1722, was disrupted following the outbreak of war.

The ITV documentary, which is due to be broadcast on Thursday, also revealed the story of Lady Sarah Wilson – the sister of the 9th Duke of Marlborough.

When war was declared she volunteered to help the effort travelling to France to set up a hospital, while her husband Colonel Gordon Wilson went to fight on the front line.

Lord Fellowes said: ‘Before the war I don’t think she was a nice person.

‘It seems to have transformed her really.’

Also uncovered in the programme is the tragic fate of the palace’s decorator, Albert Farley, who volunteered for service before conscription.

But documents reveal that he acquired a bad disciplinary record and received one of the most controversial penalties served out to errant men on the front line – Field Punishment No1.

It involved tying the man to a fixed point for two hours a day for 21 days.

Winston Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911 and held this position as the First World War began.

He pushed the idea of attacking Gallipoli in 1915, which turned out to be one of Britain's most disastrous military campaigns.

It had been intended to clear a relief route to Russia by securing a route from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.

But fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster.

The campaign cost the lives of 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen - and Churchill became a scapegoat for it, later resigning.

He then returned to the Army and was appointed Lieutenant Colonel, commanding the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. He led by example, often venturing into No Man’s Land on night patrol.

During a visit to the frontline with his first cousin Charles Spencer-Churchill, the 9th Duke of Marlborough, he had his own lucky escape.

A large piece of shrapnel fell between the two men. They were unharmed in the blast and each took a shell fragment to remind them of their lucky escape.

Mr Churchill's stint in the trenches came to an end shortly after when, because of high casualties, his battalion was merged with another and he was told to return to Britain and resume his work in the Commons.

Six weeks later the war was over but Farley was reported missing and it was accepted that he had died. 

Lord Fellowes added: ‘It’s rather sad isn’t it. You think he volunteered to protect his country and went off brave and it hasn’t gone well from the beginning so the question is what happened to him?’

Farley was one over a million people who died in the war, and while the Great Depression followed, the 9th Duke of Marlborough refused to accept the change to life at Blenheim.

He spent money on the house and gardens – a legacy which is continued today by his ancestors.

The First World War also had a great effect on Sir Winston, who wanted to make his mark, but as first Lord of the Admiralty he was held responsible for the disastrous invasion at Gallipoli.

He was forced out of office and his reputation was ruined – and his response was to go to the Western Front as an ordinary battalion commander.

‘He decides to go to the front to face the danger and to be with the men who are fighting and very possibly to be killed. He was enormously brave in the face of whatever happened to him,’ said Lord Fellowes.

‘I think Winston Churchill was one of those people who were changed for the better by the First World War.

‘That very aristocratic sense of entitlement, unquestioned, rather arrogant really, seemed to develop into something kinder and more modern. The First World War made him the man to win the Second World War.’

German forces bombarded Antwerp in Belgium on October 7, 1914, as Belgian troops and their British allies struggled to resist the ambush.

After the fall of the forts at Liege in the opening weeks of the First World War, King Albert I ordered the Belgian army’s remaining 65,000 troops to retreat to Antwerp.

The city was protected by a ring of 48 inner and outer forts and 80,000 garrison troops.

Belgian forces conducted sorties designed to distract the German First Army, led by General Alexander von Cluck, from its attacks against the British and French over the French frontier.

A German bombardment with heavy and super heavy artillery of the Belgian fortifications began on September 28.

The famous Big Bertha – a 420mm siege howitzer gun – made an immediate impact and aroused the concern of the British War Office.

The German’s succeeded in penetrating two of the city’s forts on October 2 and Winston Churchill, as the first Lord of Admiralty, was sent to personally assess the damage.

His telegraph to Minister of War Lord H. H. Kitchener on October 4 stated that the Belgian troops were ‘weary and disheartened’ and the ground was so waterlogged it was impossible for Belgian’s to dig trenches.

On October 5, 8,000 troops of the British Royal Naval Division arrived in Antwerp transported in London city buses. The next day 22,000 more British troops arrived but were unable to withstand the German onslaught in a fierce bombardment on October 7.

The next day, Antwerp was evacuated and its military governor, General Victor Deguise, formally surrendered to the Germans on October 18.

German forces occupied the city for the rest of the war until it was liberated in late 1918.
