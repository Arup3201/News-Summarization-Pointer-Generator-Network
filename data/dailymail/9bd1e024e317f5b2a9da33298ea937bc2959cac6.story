A 70-foot pine tree crashed through a home and crushed a man beneath it while he was sitting at his desk working on his computer. He was severely injured and airlifted to the hospital.

The massive Douglas fir, which is about three feet wide, was knocked over without warning in a windstorm. 

The incident occurred in a home near Oregon City on Wednesday at approximately 7:40am, Brandon Paxton with Clackamas Fire District 1  told The Oregonian.

The man was helped out from under the tree before being given first aid by firefighters, who ordered a helicopter, the newspaper reported.

The Douglas fir was thought to stand 70 feet, he also told The Oregonian.

Severe winds which started on Tuesday caused the tree as well as 'dozens' of others to fall down, the newspaper reported.

The man's neighbor, Jamie Cole, told KOIN 'It sounded like the gods of thunder were coming down on us.'

'I knew [the wind] was bad,' Cole also said. 'I knew it wasn’t a tornado but I knew it was not going to be pretty ...Prayers to his family. I hope he’s okay.'

Crew: Firefighters helped the man get out from under the tree
