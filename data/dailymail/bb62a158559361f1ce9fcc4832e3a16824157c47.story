Manchester United playmaker Angel di Maria celebrated his return from injury by posing for a number of pictures with his daughter Mia.

His wife Jorgelina Cardoso posted a collage of Di Maria and their daughter pulling funny faces with the message 'Amor en estado puro' which translates to 'Love in its purest form'.

Di Maria made his first appearance for Louis van Gaal's side since the end of November after overcoming a hamstring injury.

Di Maria made his injury comeback by coming on for the last 29 minutes against Aston Villa

The Argentina superstar replaced Robin van Persie in the 61st minute at Aston Villa on Saturday but was unable to help his side seal their seventh consecutive Premier League victory.

However the former Real Madrid ace will be delighted to get some minutes under his belt ahead of the busy festive period in which United face Newcastle, Tottenham and Stoke before their third round FA Cup clash against Yeovil.

Di Maria, Manchester United's record signing, will be in contention to start against Newcastle on Boxing Day after proving his fitness in the 1-1 draw with Aston Villa.

The 26-year-old started the season off in impressive form by scoring three goals in his first five games after sealing a £60million move to Old Trafford.

His last goal for Manchester United came on October 5 when he scored the opening goal in his side's 2-1 win against Everton.
