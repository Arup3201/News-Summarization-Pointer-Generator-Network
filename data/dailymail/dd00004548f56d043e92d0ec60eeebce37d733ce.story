After Miranda Kerr tweeted out pictures of herself frolicking on a golden beach in Mexico this week, the world looked on in envy.

And it seems she isn't the only Victoria's Secret model to be flaunting her enviable figure on the beach while the rest of us battle the January blues.

Fellow Angel Jessica Van Der Steen has been unveiled as the face (and incredibly toned body) of Heidi Klein's latest swimwear range with a stunning seaside campaign video to go with it.

Beach babe: Jessica Van Der Steen has been unveiled as the face of Heidi Klein's Resort Summer 2013 collection

The new video and campaign images for the Resort Summer 2013 collection show 29-year-old Jessica dancing against the beautiful
hills and the calming seas of Mustique, a small private island that is part of St Vincent and the Grenadines.

Taking inspiration from hidden 
treasures and the secrets of the sea, this collection is all about the 
beautiful details.

Swimwear fans will be impressed by the intricate beading and exotic embellishment of the 
flowing kaftans and floaty, beach dresses.

In true Heidi Klein style, the swimwear garments are designed with hidden support to ensure the perfect fit, which Jessica models to perfection.

Classic: Swimsuits from the label are classic and simple with added intricate beading

Making a splash: The campaign video sees Jessica playing in the sea with two local girls

The collection has key safari influences and python and zebra prints as well as nautical themes make this collection perfect for the winter sun.

The Belgian fashion model can be seen cheekily wiggling her bottom and playfully blowing kisses to the camera as well as posing on the front of a boat.

Jessica, who appeared in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition in both 2004 and 2005, can be seen at the end of the fun beach side video prancing around with two young girls in the sea.

Prices for the classic bikinis start at £180 while kaftans are around £280.
