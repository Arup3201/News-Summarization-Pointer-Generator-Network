Thermal cameras could one day pick drunk people out of a crowd, by monitoring the body temperature of various parts of their face.

Scientists in Greece have published a paper detailing how two computer formulas, in conjunction with the camera, can spot physical differences, such as the dilation of blood vessels in a drunk's cheek, or the slight increase in heat on a drunk person's nose when compared with their forehead.

The concept has been used before in airports to help spot people with infections, such as SARS, but the new twist on the technology could be used as sports events or crowded areas as an aid to security teams or police.

Thermal spots: The new software developed in Greece can look at changes in body temperature to determine sobriety

Georgia Koukiou and Vassilis Anastassopoulos, from the University of Patras in Greece, have produced two algorithms to analyse data from cameras.

They noted how alcohol causes blood vessel dilation at the skin's surface, so by comparing different spots on the face, they can spot individual pixel-width differences.

A second program looks at heat variability across areas of the face, based on observations that the nose becomes relatively hot compared to a cooler forehead when a person is inebriated.

Differences such as a warmer nose and inflamed blood vessels in the cheek can all indicate how much alcohol is in someone's system

The authors suggest the system could be used to stop the police or officials making mistakes based on ill-founded assumptions based on someone's appearance or behaviour.

Or publicans or shops could use the technology to help them assess whether to serve customers.

A similar technology was deployed outside St Paul's Cathedral by police during the Occupation protests earlier this year.

However the technology is likely to raise concerns over privacy, particularly if deployed en masse on the general public.
