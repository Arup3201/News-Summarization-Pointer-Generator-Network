Don't be put off by their rather curious appearance. Black tomatoes are being grown in Britain for the first time – and they could have the potential to stave off cancer. 

The fruit is among the first in the world to contain anthocyanins, an antioxidant believed to help fight cancer, diabetes and obesity.

The tomato’s jet black colour stems from pigments in its skin which develop when exposed to sunlight.

UK first: The jet black tomatoes, grown by Ray Brown from Pant World in Newton Abbot, Devon, are the only of their kind in the country

Plant man: Expert Ray, above, was sent the seeds by a customer and was staggered when the fruit grew jet black on the vines

Ray Brown, 66, who runs Plant World Seeds, first came across the unusual fruit when a customer sent him a mystery package entitled 'black tomato'.

Confused by the enigmatic the label, he sowed the product and was stunned at the resulting black tomatoes which appeared.

Mr Brown, from Newton Abbot, Devon, said: 'A customer sent us some seeds just named 'black tomato' last winter and we couldn't believe that they were real so we sowed them in the spring to see.

'We are always looking for something original. Nobody has every produced black tomatoes, the closest they have got are brown ones and orange ones.

'It was always something people thought was impossible, we thought it was an April Fool's Day hoax.

'But when we grew them we realised they were jet black, we were absolutely staggered.

'They are completely new, as far as I'm aware they have never, ever been grown in this country before.'

The tomatoes are believed to have been
 developed at Oregon State University, in America, forming part of their
 'Indigo Rose' project.

They
 are ripe when their colour changes from a shiny blue-purple to an 
almost jet black, with the bottoms of the tomatoes turning red.

The dark version of the fruit rich high in beneficial anthocyanins, which are compounds found in 
fruits, vegetables and beverages.

Some believe the anti-oxidant can help with 
diabetes, cancer and obesity.

They aroused interest of the scientific community after their powerful health boosting effects were discovered during American lab tests.

Unusual: The colour, a result of a genetic mutation, makes the fruit richer in health boosting anti-oxidants that its red cousin

Strong: Ray said he has eaten lots of his black tomatoes, describing them as having a 'good, strong' flavour.

Mr Brown has a total of three plants, each containing 20 tomatoes which have black skins but are red on the inside.

'No one can quite believe what we've got, they keep asking if it's a joke, or if they're edible' he said.

'They
 are edible, we've eaten lots, they have a nice taste and a really 
lovely flavour. The only way to describe it is a good, strong tomatoey 
taste.'

'The fruit is also unique because it doesn't use genetic engineering to create it' added Mr Brown, who currently has no plans to market the black tomatoes.

'It is entirely done by selection techniques.'
