Once again: a hidden camera has caught New Yorkers' weakness for the female body. 

A woman patrolled the streets of the city in yoga pants with a device attached to her backside, capturing every man - and woman - that stole a glance.

It comes after the controversial viral clip by feminist group HollaBack, which charted the number of cat calls one woman received over 10 hours. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Caught: A woman patrolled the streets of the city in yoga pants with a device attached to her backside

First of 59: This man was one of 59 New Yorkers snapped looking into the camera on her rear

Delighted! These two men looked over the moon as they looked down at the view before them

Ecstatic: One man in Union Square giggled cheekily looking over at the woman

But this undercover investigation had a different message: promoting prostate cancer awareness.

Men are urged to 'check out your own butt' in the playful sketch which tallies the number of people looking. 

At one point, two Hasidic Jewish men seemingly balk in delight at the view before them. 

An elderly woman looks intrigued.

Tallied: The number jumped up by four as the woman passed this group of men who all turned to look

Three women were involved in the making of the video and one man turned to glance at two of them

Not all men: A woman caught a curious glance at the camera disguised as an iPod perched on her bottom

The stunt was in fact a promotion for men's health awareness, calling on people to check themselves

One man leaps out from behind his girlfriend to get a better look.

Each time another head turns, a 'ding' noise sounds and the face is enlarged.

In total, 59 people - including a billboard and a couple of dubious glances - are clocked. 

Viral: The playful video followed the controversial piece by HollaBack charting cat calls in New York 

Check your own butt! New Yorkers like this man are encouraged to check for cancerous lumps

Not impressed? An elderly woman looks horrified at the tight attire the woman is wearing

A message then flashes up on the screen: Happy Movember #CheckYourButt.

November is Men's Health Awareness Month, for which many men around the world grow mustaches. 

The 'check your butt' campaign, similar to the 'coppa feel' campaign, is encouraging men to check the skin between their bottom and groin for a lump that could be cancerous. 

Another giggling viewer: It seems everyone was appreciate of the sight 

Shocked: Times Square's characters joined the throng of people catchign glances

This man jumped around his girlfriend to become the 48th viewer caught on camera

Awareness: This message popped up at the end of the YouTube video
