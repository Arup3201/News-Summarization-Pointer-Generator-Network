She is said to be dating Charles Saatchi after the collapse of his marriage.

But whether Trinny Woodall’s pronounced pout is the result of intensive kissing remains a tight-lipped secret.

The 49-year-old’s naturally bee-stung lips looked larger than ever on her latest outing with the 70-year-old advertising tycoon.

The 49-year-old's naturally bee-stung lips looked larger than ever on her latest outing with the 70-year-old advertising tycoon

The pair were on their tenth outing together at Scott’s restaurant in Mayfair since he split with his wife Nigella Lawson.

Miss
Woodall - best known for her What Not To Wear programmes - has 
previously admitted using Botox to combat the effects of ageing, but has
always denied using filler injections in her lips.

She
once said she would ‘definitely’ have cosmetic surgery, but insisted: 
‘People said I’d had my lips done but I haven’t. I’ve had these all my 
life - and I love them.’

Familiar scene: Saatchi has not been shy about taking Trinny to Scott's in Mayfair, where he was pictured holding Nigella Lawson's throat

The TV stylist is said to have begun dating Mr Saatchi just six weeks after his marriage to Miss Lawson ended.

Their marriage imploded after he was pictured holding the cookery writer by the throat over lunch at Scott’s.

Miss
Woodall and Mr Saatchi - who has a personal fortune of £130million - 
are said to have met through his friends, who are keen to help him 
recover from his divorce.

Table for two! Trinny and Charles are becoming very frequent inhabitants of Scott's restaurant for their intimate get togethers

The restaurant is not 
just famed for its pricey food and the even pricier artworks which fill 
its walls, but as the rather infamous venue where 70-year-old Charles 
effectively wound up ending his marriage to domestic goddess Nigella 
Lawson.

It was here at Scott's that he was pictured shouting at his wife, trying to wring her neck and bringing her to tears.

It
was literally only days after pictures from Charles and Nigella's last 
lunch together emerged that the two announced they were divorcing.

Charles
hasn't been sitting around, missing Nigella's magic touch in the 
kitchen it would appear. He and Trinny have now been hot and heavy as an
item for the best part of two months. It seems that Scott's has become 
their second home for their intimate rendezvous and they don't mind the 
world knowing.

Ready to lunch! Trinny holds court on the phone at Scott's as she and her new man Charles arrive to dine...yet again

The two lovebirds seemed so wrapped up in 
conversation that they either forgot to order their food...or are just 
having an extremely light lunch

For their most recent get 
together, Charles was dressed in his usual smart black suit and a crisp 
white suit, which belies his years.

Trinny
kept it casual yet chic as she kept a dark blazer wrapped around her 
with a number of layers underneath to help stop the London chill.

Trinny
also looked remarkably fresh-faced, unable to stop herself smiling and 
tossing her long honey-hued locks about her shoulders as she flirted and
chatted with her new man about town.

What a shame Scott's don't do takeaway! Trinny and Charles have to resort to a bag of fast food for Saturday night date night at home

After the chirpy twosome
finished their date at Scott's they left in Trinny's Mini Cooper, 
stopping off on the way to pick up some food for a Saturday night in.

Clearly
they hadn't eaten enough at Scott's, or else the meal was full of fine 
conversation, cigarettes and booze but not much in the way of actual 
stomach stuffing.

Perhaps 
this is when Charles might actually start missing his ex wife the most. 
Nigella meanwhile has put her former marriage behind her and been busy 
filming a UK version of her US series The Taste for Channel 4.
