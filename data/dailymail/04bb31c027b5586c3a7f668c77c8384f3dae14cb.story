Nigeria’s military was warned about the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls by Islamic  militants but failed to act, it was claimed last night.

Human rights group Amnesty International said it had reports from credible sources insisting that security forces knew about the planned raid four hours before it took place.

The news came as intelligence emerged suggesting the kidnappers, from Al Qaeda-linked group Boko Haram, have split the schoolgirls into at least four groups in an attempt to make rescue ‘virtually impossible’.

The
 operation overseen by Special Forces came as David Cameron was forced 
to deny that the international community is behaving in a 'patronising' 
way towards the government of Nigeria by sending experts to assist in 
the hunt for almost 300 abducted schoolgirls.

Western
 officials have expressed frustration that it took nearly three weeks 
for the Nigerian authorities to accept help - days which allowed the 
Boko Haram gunmen and their terrified hostages to scatter and escape 
into a vast dense forest amid reports some have already crossed the 
border into neighbouring countries.

Mr
 Cameron stressed that his decision to send a small group of UK experts 
to offer advice and logistical support - joining Special Forces officers
 in the capital Abuja - came in response to a request from Nigerian 
president Goodluck Jonathan.

Britain,
 the US, China and France have all now offered assistance, and former 
prime minister Gordon Brown has confirmed that air and satellite 
surveillance is to be extended to neighbouring countries Cameroon, Chad 
and Niger amid fears that the 276 girls kidnapped from a school in the 
village of Chibok in northern Nigeria three weeks ago may be trafficked 
across the border to be sold as slaves.

A
 specialist team from Whitehall and another from the US arrived in 
Nigeria yesterday to help co-ordinate the hunt and any rescue operation 
with Special Forces on standby to support and provide expertise for 
Nigerian-led raids.

SAS 
'electronic teams' deployed with Nigerian officers are to attempt to 
intercept any voice communication across a huge area of jungle. They 
will use sophisticated jamming equipment called to listen and intercept 
anything that 'moves or speaks' and collate signals intelligence.

Following
 requests from SAS officers deployed to Nigeria, UK ministers are said 
to be reviewing the potential of deploying a Sentinel surveillance 
aircraft, which would operate out of the French military base at 
N'djamena in Chad.

The brazenness of the kidnap has shocked Nigerians, who have been growing accustomed to hearing about atrocities in the five-year-old Islamist insurgency in the north

The 
Sentinel 'radar' plane operated by the RAF's 5 Squadron at Waddington 
could be deployed within days, but defence ministers are waiting to see 
if the Americans are going to provide additional aerial surveillance.

The
 British officers have highlighted that the Nigerians needs to isolate 
the extremists, if possible, in order to make sure they cannot strike at
 more targets before any rescue is mounted.

Asked
 about suggestions in Nigeria that the offer of international help was 
patronising, Mr Cameron said: 'We want to work with them and to help, 
but we are certainly not patronising the Nigerian government.

'This
 is an extremely difficult situation. These girls have been kidnapped 
and taken into a jungle area three times the size of Wales. It is an 
incredibly difficult thing grappling with these extremist Islamist 
groups that are prepared to go to any lengths and do appalling things.

'That
 is why we have a long-standing arrangement with the Nigerian government
 and we have police advisers and military advisers who work with them 
long before this crisis started. We offered help right after the 
abduction was made and we are now stepping up what we are doing, but all
 the time working with and asking the Nigerian government what they 
want.

'I spoke directly with
 the president myself and made an offer which he accepted. But I 
wouldn't want to go beyond what it is they want us to do.' Mr Brown, who
 is the United Nations special envoy on global education, said that he 
had spoken to US secretary of state John Kerry, who agreed that air and 
satellite surveillance would be extended into neighbouring countries.

The
 former PM urged British people to sign the Bring Back Our Girls 
petition, which he said was putting pressure on the Nigerian government 
to take action and making clear that the international community shared 
the 'revulsion' of ordinary Nigerians for Boko Haram.

US
 First Lady Michelle Obama is among dozens of political figures and 
celebrities, including Jessie J., Angelina Jolie, Leona Lewis, Hillary 
Clinton, schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai and model Cara Delevingne to have 
backed the petition.

Speaking
 from Nigerian capital Abuja, Mr Brown said: 'The more people who can 
sign the petition the more I think the Nigerian government officials and
 others will want to take action.' He said : 'The first thing is to 
locate the girls. It is every parent's nightmare that your daughter or 
son could be kidnapped and you never see them again, and particularly so
 as the danger is that they are being trafficked into other countries as
 sex slaves.

'I have been 
working with the UK and US governments and now China and France to get 
the resources for surveillance for locating these girls - satellite and 
also air coverage.

'I hope 
we can have a special push over the next few days to see if we can find 
the girls. But we have also got to make the schools safe for other girls
 and boys who are afraid of the terrorists." Asked whether the 
authorities in Abuja were doing enough to find the girls, Mr Brown said:
 'I don't think you can have any doubt now about the urgency with which 
this is being addressed. I have been pressing for action for three 
weeks. We have got a combination of international resources and we have 
got a government which is prepared now to take action about the schools 
in the country.

'We are 
going to have an action plan within the next few days. But of course the
 first thing is to see can we get these girls, who have been so sadly 
removed from their homes, can we get them back? That's where the energy 
is in the next few days.'
