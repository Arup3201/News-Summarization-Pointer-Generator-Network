The number of supermarkets and convenience stores selling alcohol round the clock shot up last year, new figures showed yesterday.

A record total of more than 2,000 outlets are now making cheap booze available to drinkers day and night, without any of the social or legal regulation that restrains yobbish behaviour in pubs and bars.

The increase led to fresh worries about the impact of Labour’s licensing reforms, passed through Parliament a decade ago, which are blamed for damaging traditional pubs and their traditional restraints on bad behaviour among drinkers.

The number of supermarkets and convenience stores selling alcohol round the clock shot up last year

The licensing figures released by the Home Office show that in the 12 months to the end of March the number of shops in England and Wales with 24-hour alcohol licences went up by five per cent to 2,100.

In just three years the numbers have swelled by 400.

The Home Office said that supermarkets and local stores now make up more than a quarter - 28 per cent - of all round-the-clock drink outlets. By contrast, only 918 pubs, bars or nightclubs have 24-hour licences.

The Home Office added that the overall increase in premises with 24-hour licences had come about because supermarkets and convenience stores are ‘driving the trend’.

Among the shop licences, 1,072 were for convenience stores and 963 for large supermarkets.The overall number of hotels, pubs, bars and stores with alcohol licences went up by 500, to 202,500.

Earlier this autumn chief constables declared 24-hour drinking a failed experiment and they called for drunk tanks to be installed on the streets to mop up the mess.

Officers said round-the-clock opening had caused ‘significant problems’ between 3am and 6pm and demanded changes to the licensing regime.

The Association of Chief Police officers said the situation was so bad that private-sector run ‘drunk tanks’ should be introduced to care for the inebriated.

Drunks should be charged up to £400-a-night, including a £100 on-the-spot fine, they said.Some analysts believe supermarkets and convenience stores contribute more to disorder than all-night bars in town centres, because their alcohol is cheaper and they impose no restraints on how it is consumed.

Senior police officers have said the Coalition’s promise to reverse the worst effects of Labour’s round-the-clock opening have yet to pay dividends.

Under a ‘late night levy’ scheme, councils can charge bars and pubs which want to open beyond midnight an extra fee of up to £4,440 each year, depending on their size.

The cash is split between councils and police to help pay for clean-up costs and put extra officers on the street.

But, one year after the new rules came into force, none of the planned zones are up and running.Since 24-hour came into operation in 2005, police have fined an estimated 400,000 people for being drunk and disorderly.

The Daily Mail - backed by senior police, ambulance staff and judges - opposed the change.

But Labour carried on regardless - claiming it would bring a peaceful, continental-style drinking culture to the UK. Since taking power, the Tories have tried to limit the harm caused by the policy.

In addition to the levy, councils have new powers to impose a blanket ban on pubs opening in the early hours of the morning. However, ministers have stopped short of returning to the traditional closing time of 11pm or midnight.

Eric Appleby of Alcohol Concern said yesterday: ‘Anyone can see that our licensing laws aren’t working, you only have to visit one of Britain’s high streets on a Friday or Saturday night to see that.‘We need a full scale review of all our licensing laws if we’re to make a change to our drinking culture.’
