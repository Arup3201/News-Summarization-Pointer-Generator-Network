A U.S. psychology professor is looking into the reasons why older people are more susceptible to scams and found that it has to do with more than just to senility.

Their susceptibility also has to do with the way older people process visual cues as well as fear and suspicion, says Shelly Taylor, a professor of psychology at the University of California Los Angeles.

Taylor began researching the matter after two homeless men duped her 70-somehting-year-old father out of $17,000, NBC News reports.

Experts have often assumed that the elderly are more vulnerable to fraud because of diminished brain capacity and because retired people often more time on their hands and more assets to spare.

Taylor and her research team did two studies to better understand the full picture.

In one study, they asked 119 people between the ages of 55 to 84 to look at photographs of people’s faces and rate them for trustworthiness.

They then asked 24 young adults in their 20s to do the same.

The two age groups generally reacted the same to the ‘trustworthy’ and neutral faces, Taylor told NBC.

But those in the older group were far less likely to agree with the young people on who looked ‘untrustworthy,’ she said.

‘They missed facial cues that are pretty easily distinguished,’ she said. ‘Is something going on the brain that would explain this pattern?’

To answer that, Taylor and her team set up a second study using functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI, which is a way to look at brain activity in real time.

They studied 23 older adults between the ages of 55 and 80 and 21 younger adults, with an average age of 33.

In the younger adults, a part of the brain called the anterior insula became active as they were examining all the faces, but especially active when looking at those with expressions or characteristics that people associate with being untrustworthy, Taylor said.

The anterior insula did not activate nearly so much in the older people, she noted.

‘Their brains are not saying “be wary,” as the brains of the younger adults are,’ she said.

Therefore, ‘a diminished “gut” response to cues of untrustworthiness may partially underlie older adults’ vulnerability to fraud,’ her report concludes.

Taylor and her team are still unsure if this is caused by reduced brain function, or simply by getting older.

‘We know that older adults are good emotion regulators. They make their lives emotionally more positive,’ she said. ‘They don’t stress out over small things. They turn away from negative scenes. They are less likely to go to scary negative movies. They kind of keep their emotional life in balance.’

Taylor and her team’s research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.
