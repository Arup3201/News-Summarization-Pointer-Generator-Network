Abdul Hanif, 30, from Bradford, has been sentenced to 17 years in jail after being found guilty of keeping a woman as a sex slave

A McDonald's worker has been found guilty of keeping a student as a sex slave for four months  while repeatedly raping and beating her.

Abdul Hanif, 30, from Bradford, also planned to force his victim into prostitution to help repay his gambling debts.

He was today sentenced to 17 years in jail at Bradford Crown Court after being found guilty of three charges of rape and one of causing actual bodily harm.

During his trail, the jury at Bradford Crown Court heard that Hanif's 26-year-old victim was a virgin before he kidnapped and raped her.

Jurors were told that the female student had moved to London from Bangladesh to study accountancy.

She first met Hanif in February when she was working in a sandwich shop in London and he 'began to groom her', the judge said.

The pair exchanged numbers, and after the woman was made homeless Hanif offered to take her to 'a nice new home' in Bradford.

In reality the pair spent several days sleeping in Hanif's car and moving between his friends' flats before he moved her to a rented apartment.

During this time Hanif took away her credit cards and mobile phone, effectively making her a prisoner, while forcing her to have sex with him every day.

The victim said she was made to cook his meals, adding that he would fly into a rage if he was unhappy with what she served.

She said Hanif wanted to use her as a prostitute to pay off his gambling debts, and when she refused he tore a phone charger from the wall and strangled her, leaving marks on her throat. 

She was only freed after managing to contact one of Hanif's former friends, Stephen Naylor, saying she was unwell and had been the victim of domestic violence. 

He alerted police who went to Hanif's flat in June last year where they battered down the door and found the victim inside.

Mr Naylor told the court: 'She said he was treating her like an animal.' 

He described Hanif as 'charismatic' but added: 'He is a very frightening man and he trusts no-one.'

The court heard the victim has had to seek help with counselling after suffering from depression, flashbacks and suicidal thoughts as a result of the treatment she suffered at the hands of Hanif.

In a victim impact statement read out to the court, she said: 'I feel as if my life is totally ruined because of what Abdul Hanif did to me.

'Everything in my life has now changed. I can't smile or go anywhere like I could before.'

The jury convicted Hanif after just 90 minutes of deliberations following his trial.

Jailing him, Judge Peter Benson said: 'Your victim was a young woman who came to London where she had no family and a limited number of friends and she struggled to find her feet.

'You seized this opportunity and lied to her and pretended you had found her a home owned by a friend. Instead of that you brought her against her will to Bradford and when she realised you were leaving London you frightened her and told her you would abandon her.

'This was a young lady who was virtually alone in a big foreign country. You wickedly exploited that vulnerability. You forced her into having sex against her will and when she refused you struck her and threatened her.

'You used her as a sexual resource and you controlled her and isolated her by restricting the use of her phone and locking her in.

'You took her bank card so you had control of her finances, such as they were, and you repeatedly raped her on an almost daily basis using no contraception.

'You treated her like a slave and went off to work, taking the only key. She was a prisoner and had no life at all as you made her cook and clean for you.

'You humiliated her by rejecting the food she cooked  while you satisfied your sexual appetite.

'Eventually when you had gambled away any money that you had, you offered her to a friend for sexual purposes but you then threatened to turn her into a prostitute for funds to feed your gambling addiction. Your threats to turn her into a prostitute finally caused her to find the courage to escape.' 

Detective Constable Brett Carter, of Protective Services at West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Hanif befriended his victim when she was vulnerable, but then went on to repeatedly rape and assault her.

'This must have been a harrowing ordeal for her and we would like to thank her for the courage she has shown in coming forward and reporting Hanif's crimes.

'We hope the sentence which has been passed down on him today will be of some comfort to her and will help to give her some closure.

'We also hope it will encourage other victims of sexual abuse to speak to our specially-trained officers, who will investigate all reports, no matter how historic, sensitively and thoroughly with the aim of securing a conviction against offenders.'

Hanif was also ordered to sign the sex offences register for life.
