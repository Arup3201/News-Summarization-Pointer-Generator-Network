Brave: The Queen still managed to  smile despite being forced to visit BBC  Broadcasting House without her beloved husband Prince Philip, who is in hospital nearby

The Queen robustly insisted the Duke of Edinburgh was ‘not ill’ yesterday.

Her comments, during a tour of the BBC’s new Broadcasting House, came as her husband underwent exploratory surgery on his abdomen.

Last night he was said to be making ‘satisfactory progress’ following the operation under general anaesthetic.

During a visit to the BBC’s new HQ, the Queen was asked by radio and TV host John Humphrys how Prince Philip was faring, She replied: ‘I have no idea, I mean he has only just gone in.’

When the Radio 4 presenter persisted, saying the Duke had looked well during his appearance at a Buckingham Palace garden party on Thursday just hours before his admission, the monarch remarked pithily: ‘That’s because he’s not ill.’

Buckingham Palace confirmed in a statement last night that the surgery had been successfully completed and the results would now be analysed.

They appeared cautiously optimistic about his recovery, saying that ‘at this early stage he is progressing satisfactorily’.

Such caution is understandable given Philip’s age and the fact that this is the fourth time he has been hospitalised in the last 18 months.

Experts said the recovery could take 
as long as two or three months meaning it could be a long time before 
the Duke is able to restart his public engagements.

Minutes before the Palace statement 
was released, however, the Queen’s physician, Professor John Cunningham,
 was seen leaving the hospital apparently in good spirits.

The statement read: ‘His Royal 
Highness The Duke of Edinburgh has had an exploratory operation 
following abdominal investigations. The results will now be analysed. At
 this early stage he is progressing satisfactorily. Further updates will
 continue to be issued when appropriate.’

Pensive: The Queen on a visit to the BBC yesterday, as Prince Philip underwent abdominal surgery

The Queen will spend the weekend at 
Windsor Castle as usual.

She is said to be ‘concerned’ and being kept 
fully informed of her husband’s progress.

Peter Phillips, the Duke’s eldest 
grandson, said the family were being informed about his grandfather’s 
progress, and he would not want them to stop going about their daily 
business.

He told BBC News: ‘Obviously our 
thoughts and prayers are with him, we know that he’s in good hands and 
we’ve been kept up to date in terms of what’s happening.

'But he’s one of
 those people who wouldn’t want you to stop just because he’s gone into 
hospital.’

Philip, who turns 92 on Monday, is set
 to remain at The London Clinic in Harley Street for up to two weeks 
following the surgery.

Details about his condition or the 
original symptoms that prompted doctors to recommend the exploratory 
operation have not been released by Buckingham Palace.

But sources have confirmed that he 
underwent tests last week and was advised that further medical 
intervention would be necessary.

Aides have insisted he is in ‘good spirits’ and had walked into the hospital unaided after being driven there by car.

They also suggested that the Duke was 
not suffering from any discomfort and had arranged to have the operation
 after doctors ‘picked something up’ during a routine health check over 
the past week.

But Mr John Moorehead, vice president 
of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, said last 
night it was ‘uncommon’ for someone of the Duke of Edinburgh’s age to 
have an exploratory surgical procedure.

Regardless of how fit the Duke might appear to be, surgery at his age carried much greater risks, he said.

‘The reason for that is regardless of 
how fit and well someone might appear to be, when you get to that age 
there’s a much increased risk of having other medical problems,’ he 
said.

‘As you get older you are more likely to have other things wrong which could complicate things during surgery.

Mr Moorehead also suggested a two-week stay in hospital ‘is longer than would be expected’ if the procedure was simply routine.

He added: ‘If it’s something very 
trivial he might be out of commission for three or four weeks or if it’s
 more serious, you could be talking about a recovery period of two or 
three months.’

Prince Philip has cancelled two 
engagements over the past week – a lecture at Windsor Castle and a 
reception at Buckingham Palace – but aides said this was not due to his 
abdominal pain.

With a two week stay, it's likely the Duke Of Edinburgh will undergo a series of tests.

GP Dr Arun Ghosh told MailOnline last night that an exploratory operation of the abdomen would usually suggest a laparoscopy - keyhole surgery to access and examine the inside of the abdomen and pelvis.

This provides a much more detailed view of what is going on inside the body than techniques such as ultrasound.

A laparoscopy is not used to diagnose cancer.The procedure is often used to investigate what appears to be an obstruction, most commonly a twisted bowel, where the natural shape of the intestines has changed or a section of the intestines has overlapped.

The Duke of Edinburgh's latest bout of ill health comes after a series of recent health complications.

He was taken into hospital in Aberdeen in August after being admitted with a recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered in June.

The Duke spent almost a week in the King Edward VII Hospital in London after falling ill with the infection during the Diamond Jubilee. It was the third time in nine months the Duke has been in hospital.

In 2011, he spent Christmas at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge after suffering chest pains at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.

He underwent surgery for a blocked coronary artery, for which he had a stent fitted.

General aesthetics can cause serious side-effects and the risks are far higher in elderly patients.

At worst they include cardiac arrest, breathing problems and brain damage - but these are very rare and less serious complications include nausea, headaches and temporary confusion.

A royal source told the Mail: ‘The Duke underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation.

‘He has been feeling under the weather in recent days but that is because he had lost his voice. The two are quite unconnected.

‘He was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today’s garden party, where he was on top form.’

The situation prompts further questions about the Duke of Edinburgh’s workload and that of the Queen. 

A few weeks ago, Buckingham Palace 
announced the pair would be scaling back on their long-haul foreign 
travel, leaving it largely to younger royals.

The Mail also revealed that high-level
 talks had been taking place between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House 
and Downing Street for Prince Charles to take an even more prominent 
role.

It will also put pressure on the Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge – who are expecting their first baby – to 
become full-time working royals.

Prince William is due to leave his 
role as an RAF search and rescue pilot in September and is expected 
within weeks to announce what he intends to do next.

He had been 
expected to take up a further military post that would give him more 
opportunity to undertake royal engagements.

However pressure is now sure
 to mount on him to leave the forces completely and take the strain off 
his elderly grandparents.

The Duke’s admittance to the clinic 
comes almost a year to the day that he was hospitalised with a serious 
bladder infection during the diamond jubilee celebrations.

At yesterday’s garden party, the Queen
 and Prince Philip appeared together on the steps of the palace at 4pm, 
when the national anthem was played.

Despite the fierce sun, with 
temperatures of around 22C (72F), the Duke appeared relaxed and happily 
chatted to guests as he walked around the garden.

Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire Sir
 John Peace was introduced to the Queen and the duke as they made their 
way through the gardens.

He said: ‘It was wonderful to see the Duke of 
Edinburgh with her.’

Sir John said the prince had been ‘telling jokes’ –
 but would not divulge what they were about.
