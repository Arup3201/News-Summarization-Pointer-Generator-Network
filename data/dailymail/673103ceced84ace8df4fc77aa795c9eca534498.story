The ultimate water fight is on with not one but two street water slides headed for Melbourne's CBD.

Radio station Nova has announced it will be transforming Landsdowne Street on January 24 into a giant slide.

The station will beat Slide.Melbourne to the punch who publicised the same event on the same street but for February 15 and March 9 earlier this month.

It is believed more than 11,000 people lined up for their chance to slip and slide down St George's Terrace in the Western Australian capital last month (pictured above)

Nova's green-and-gold slide will be 315 metres long, while Slide.Melbourne's will be slightly larger at 400 metres.

'We’re taking this Aussie backyard tradition to the next level,' the station's website read.

'Get your mates together and get ready for some adrenaline pumping slip-sliding fun and much more to keep you entertained throughout the day.' 

Like Slide.Melbourne's Nova has reassured the street slide will be recycling the water used on the day.

'The event organisers will pay local authorities to access water equivalent to 300 average showers, which will be circulated and reused throughout the slide during the course of the day,' its website said.

'The water will be constantly monitored, filtered and tested to ensure that Department of Health regulations are met and exceeded.' 

Similar to the one in Perth (pictured above), Nova's will transform Melbourne's Landsdowne Street. This follows Slide.Melbourne announced it would do the same 

In November, it is believed more than 11,000 people lined up for their chance to slip and slide down St George's Terrace in Perth.

When Slide.Melbourne announced its Lansdowne Street event, it claimed the slide would be 'the longest city street slide anywhere in the world'.

It promises to be three lanes wide and 400 metres long. 

Like Nova's version, Slide.Melbourne guarantees no drop will go to waste.

Its 'Splashback Policy' outlines the slide's water consumption equals that of 400 showers.

The used water will then be recycled and used to keep Melbourne's gardens looking green. 

But it is also asking participants to do their bit as well.

'Imagine if on the day you slide with us, you promise to only have a two-minute shower,' Slide.Melbourne's website said.

'If you promise to do that then you and Slide.Melbourne could actually save over 100,000 litres of water.'

For a $40 and a 'small booking fee', sliders can get the most bang out of their buck for two hours.

Slide.Melbourne said ticket holders could fit in at least three slides in their session.
