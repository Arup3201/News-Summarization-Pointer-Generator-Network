NBC's Bob Costas was a sight for sore eyes during the network's coverage of the Winter Olympics in Sochi after contracting pink eye.

The New York Post's Page Six is suggesting NBC’s 61-year-old prime-time Olympic host may have inadvertently caught the nasty eye virus whilst having Botox injections.

At one point, Costas' had to take six days off to recover, to be replaced by Meredith Viera because his viral conjunctivitis had become so bad and spread to both eyes.

NBC have flatly denied the claim that botox played any part in the sportscasters' condition.

Sight for sore eyes: The pink eye in the sportscaster's left eye spread to both 
eyes in the first few days of NBC's Olympic coverage

Sore: Costas said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red
 'as the Soviet flag'

Also known as Conjunctivitis, pinkeye is an infection of the mucus membrane that lines the eyelid - causing the eyes to become red and inflamed.

Pinkeye is most commonly contracted from a virus which can spread through person to person contact or contaminated water.

Doctors suggest thorough hand-washing as the best way to prevent getting the infection. Conjunctivitis can also be caused by bacteria, lack of tears, chemicals or allergies.

It is not a serious infection and usually clears up within 7 to 10 days.

While bacterial pinkeye can be treated with antibiotic eye drops, ointment or pills - viral pinkeye usually doesn't have a specific treatment.

However eagle-eyed viewers noted how smooth Costas' forehead was during the high definition coverage of the Sochi games.

A spokesperson from NBC Sports insisted to the New York Post: 'This has zero truth to this. Zero.'

On
 the first day of NBC's primetime coverage, the journalist appeared on 
camera wearing eyeglasses instead of his usual contact lenses, 
explaining that he had a medical problem with his eyes, which appeared 
swollen and red.

After 
battling through the infection for five nights on-air and sporting a new
 look by wearing thick glasses, Costas was forced to take nearly a week 
off from the Olympics, with Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira sitting in 
for him.

He told reporters that it caused light sensitivity and blurred vision.

'The worst three days of it I was primarily in a darkened room,' he said.

During one broadcast he joked about his red, watery and puffy left eye.

'I
 have no choice to go all Peabody and Sherman on you for the next couple
 of nights since I woke up this morning with my left eye swollen shut 
and just about as red as the old Soviet flag.'

Following
 the primetime broadcast, the eye became a trending topic on Twitter, 
spawning numerous jokes and even a parody account.

Costas, who has been NBC's Olympic presenter since 1992, admitted that he was miserable throughout the entire ordeal.

Doctors
 say it is rare to contract an infection from a Botox injection, unless 
there was some sort of contamination or the patient suffered an allergic reaction.

Infection: Page Six says Costas' botox injections were to blame. NBC says that's complete nonsense and doctors also say it's very unlikely

Pioneer: Meredith Vieira took over the coverage becoming  the first woman to anchor NBC Olympics primetime

Infection started in left eye before spreading to the right

It's thought the conjunctivitis was as a result of getting Botox injections

NBC have said such a suggestion contains 'zero truth' and even doctors agree it is extremely unlikley
