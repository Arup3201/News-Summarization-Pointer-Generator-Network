A robber dressed as a clown collecting cash for charity has been caught on camera walking into a shop and demanding money from staff.

The thief strolled into a currency exchange shop wearing a yellow wig, white face paint and a pink prosthetic nose and forced a terrified worker to hand over bundles of notes.

CCTV camera footage shows the man, holding a red bucket, calmly enter the Cheque Centre in Walton, LIverpool, before making his demands to the female employee at the counter.
