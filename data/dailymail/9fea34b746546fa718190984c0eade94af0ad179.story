Susan James, 44, was found hanged after police took six hours to respond to a 999 call from her home where the line mysteriously cut out

A charity worker was found hanged after police took six hours to respond to a 999 call from her home where the line mysteriously cut out.

The body of Susan James, 44, was found by a police officer sent to her home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, after she rang the emergency number but did not say anything.

A post-mortem examination carried out on the businesswoman's body found that she died from hanging and police said they were not treating her death as suspicious.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating why it took so long for Thames Valley Police to send an officer  following the mystery drop out call on September 13.

IPCC Associate Commissioner Guido Liguori said: 'My condolences go out to Susan's family and friends for their loss.

'Our investigation will consider the force's response to the call including the circumstances surrounding the delay in police attending the house.

'We are just looking at the call handling aspect of it.

'We are looking at what happened between the call being made at midnight and the officers going to the address at 6am.

'We need to find out what happened during that period - was there a delay and what were the reasons for that and what information did they have and what did they do with it?'

Ms James worked as a finance manager at the Chiltern MS Centre, a charity providing support for people with multiple sclerosis based in Wendover, near Aylesbury.

At her funeral, the charity's chief executive, Robert Breakwell, described her as 'vibrant and full of life.'

Mr Breakwell said of her death: 'People's reactions quickly turned to disbelief, shock and deep sadness for the loss of someone so young.

'Every single person from the MS Centre will have been helped by Susan in some way.

'We all loved having Susan around. We are missing her and we will continue to miss her.

'We respected her dedication, hard work and commitment and it was a privilege to have known and worked with her.

'We won't forget Susan and we will treasure the fun times and the happy memories that she gave to us all.'

An inquest was opened and adjourned into Ms James' death, but a date for the full hearing was yet to be set.

A police spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police has referred its handling of an unexplained death to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

'The referral is in relation to an incident in the early hours of September 13.

'A 44-year-old woman died at a residential property in Aylesbury.

'The death is being treated as unexplained but is not believed to be suspicious. A file has been prepared for the coroner.'
