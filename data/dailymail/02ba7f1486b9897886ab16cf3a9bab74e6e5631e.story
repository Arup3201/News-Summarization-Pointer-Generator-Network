A man who tricked a woman he met on a dating site into having sexual relations with him after deceiving her over his appearance has fronted court.

Deepak Dhankar, 29, an Indian man, told the woman who he met on dating website Oasis he was a blonde, built, and muscular Australian man called Jamie.

When Dhankar turned up to the woman's house he engaged in sexual activity with her - while she kept her eyes closed - the Victorian County Court heard on Tuesday, Fairfax reported. 

Prosecutor Russ Hammill told the court the woman did keep her eyes shut through their exchange, but caught a glimpse of the man's dark skin when she opened them after hearing one of her children stir next door.

The woman had been left suffering from crippling anxiety and panic attacks, it was revealed when her victim impact statement was read to the court. 

Dhankar, a married and apparent father-of-two pleaded guilty to one charge of procuring sexual penetration by fraud over the incident, which took place in October 2012.

Mr Hammill also told the court the mother feared for her safety and that of her children once she became aware the man was not who she thought he was, but continued to 'play along' with Dhankar until he left.

She then confronted him following the ordeal and the 29-year-old pleaded with her not to contact police, as he had two daughters that needed a father.

Dhankar is said to have repeatedly called the woman that night, and sent her an image of two young girls the next day who he claimed would with be without their dad if he was put behind bars.

The woman's victim impact statement revealed she considered herself a 'lesser person and a horrible mother' and blamed her trusting nature for the incident.

Defence counsel Jane Dixon, QC said Dhankar's actions as 'extremely deceitful, dishonest and stupid'.

'What might have started off as experimental sexual behaviour online ... developed into a deception which had very significant consequences,' she told the court.

Dhankar's wife has said she will stick by his side, and the man has agreed to undergo counselling.

Judge Jane Patrick warned that people should not mislead others on dating websites.  

Dhankar is on bail and will be sentenced later this month.
