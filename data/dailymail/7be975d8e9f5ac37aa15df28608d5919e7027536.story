Brigitte Bardot has launched an astonishing attack on the boss of the Queen’s grocer, Fortnum & Mason, for selling ‘cruel’ foie gras.

Miss Bardot, a siren of the screen in the 1960s and now an animal welfare campaigner, has described the upmarket store’s managing director, Ewan Venters, as an ‘imbecile’.

The 78-year-old former actress and model finds herself at odds with the French farmers who have produced the expensive gourmet food for generations.

It is the result of force feeding ducks and geese to the point that their livers become enlarged and ready to be processed into a smooth pate.

The livers, which can swell to ten times their normal size, press against the birds’ lungs, causing them to pant constantly.

Such is the concern about the welfare of the birds involved that production of foie gras using these methods is banned in Britain.

Welfare worry: Miss Bardot disagrees with foie gras production in which geese and birds are force fed until their livers swell to ten times their normal size

Miss Bardot said: ‘Mr Venters seems to 
be one of those imbeciles who, just for a fleeting moment of flavour, is
willing to ignore the overwhelming scientific evidence that 
force-feeding ducks and geese to produce grotesquely enlarged livers for
foie gras is horrifically cruel.

‘I hope France will end this shameful abuse of birds, which is quite rightly banned in Venters' own country. But until then, Mr Venters should keep his hands off our geese.’

She is one of the latest in a long list of welfare groups and celebrities, such as Sir Roger Moore and Sir Paul McCartney, to campaign against the sale of foie gras in the UK.

Leading French animal-protection groups – including the Brigitte Bardot Foundation and the Society for the Protection of Animals – have joined a call by the campaigning group PETA for Fortnum & Mason to end the sale of foie gras.

They have written to Mr Venters, saying: ‘Thousands of people in France are working towards an end to the shameful practice of force feeding birds and we respectfully urge you not to help keep this inhumane and shrinking industry alive.

‘Vets and avian experts around the world agree it is not possible to produce foie gras humanely.’

They add: ‘Britain has always been regarded as a leader in the humane treatment of animals which is why the production of foie gras is quite rightly illegal in your country.

Foie gras is made of duck or goose liver.

By French law, it is defined as the liver of a duck fattened by force feeding corn. Outside of France it is sometimes produced using natural feeding. 

The technique, known as gavage, dates back as far as 2500 BC when the ancient Egyptians kept birds for food and deliberately fattened them by force feeding.

France is today the largest producer and consumer of foie gras but it is also made and consumed around the world especially in Europe, America and China.

In France, foie gras comes in various forms such as whole foie gras which is made of one or two whole liver lobes, or as pieces of livers mixed together. It also comes fully cooked as a moulded block made up of 98 per cent foie gras.

‘Here in France awareness is growing 
about the abuse of ducks and geese for foie gras and we are hopeful that
one day soon such a ban will be adopted in France too.

‘Until then we ask that you reconsider 
your conscience and question the morality of a British store paying 
French farmers to abuse geese in ways that would be illegal in your own 
country. Tradition is never an excuse for animal cruelty.’

A store spokesman said: ‘Fortnum & Mason is a traditional retailer who over the centuries has established a strong reputation for supplying certain traditional foods, amongst which is foie gras.

‘As a retailer we are here to provide our customers with the products they ask for, including foie gras and we respect their right to buy and enjoy the foods they like.

‘However we uphold strict guidelines relating to the making of foie gras and work to the best of our abilities to ensure that these gold standard production requirements are upheld at all times by the suppliers we use.’
