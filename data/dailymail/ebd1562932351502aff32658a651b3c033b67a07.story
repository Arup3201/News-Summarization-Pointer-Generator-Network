Parents of university students whose summer adventures were ruined when a travel firm went bust claim it continued to advertise tours and request payments while it was in financial straits.

Furious students, their parents and UK charities that benefited from the excursions all say there was no indication GBCE Ltd, trading as Student Adventures, was in trouble.

Hundreds of students continued to raise cash and spend thousands of pounds on travel costs and equipment as the company struggled to stay afloat before it entered receivership Thursday, just days after it asked some students for final payment.

Now, the students are potentially out of pocket for the costs and the charities have lost an important source of fundraising.

Charles Lankester’s 20-year-old son, Nick, was one of almost 40 Nottingham University students who were blindsided at the very last second and forced to abandon their trek to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.

The students were checking in at London Gatwick Airport on Thursday when they received emails or text messages alerting them that GBCE was no longer in business.

Mr Lankester said: ‘They all travelled from all over the UK to be at Gatwick and literally as they were at the check-in desk they were advised that the trip wouldn’t be taking place.

‘It’s better that it happened when it did. However, many students are already on their travel experiences and the fact that we were asked for the final payment days ago when the company must have had an indication of its financial problems leaves a very, very bad feeling.

‘Financial problems don’t arise within the space of 72 hours. It’s a month-by-month thing.’

Parents are demanding to know how long GBCE was quietly in financial straits, and they say the company could have done a better job at handling the situation.

Mr Lankester said: ‘I think the company should have been far more transparent. It should have been honest and communicated earlier.’

He said students spent countless hours collecting charitable donations from strangers – sometimes in the rain – while preparing for memorable trips around the world. His son raised money for the Meningitis Research Foundation.

‘He’s like all his friends. He’s angry, he’s disappointed and he is confused as to how this could happen, but mainly angry.’ 

The Civil Aviation Authority says it has taken action to ensure travellers are protected, with around 100 currently abroad with GBCE who have scheduled airline tickets so will be able to travel home as planned.

The CAA said those who were due to go on future trips with the company who received an Atol certificate when booking are protected for any money they paid directly to the company.

An apparent customer named Sophie Bell took to Twitter to share her anger at the situation.

She wrote: 'Still no contact from #studentadventures - what an absolutely disgraceful company... Diabolical situation.'

Another, named only as Alice, said: 'Absolutely appalling that #studentadventures haven't had the decency to personally contact participants yet.' 

Students and parents are also questioning how none of the company's partners noticed when GBCE's ATOL licence was not renewed with the Civil Aviation Authority in March.

Mr Lankester said that should have been 'a huge red flag'. 

Parents have expressed concerns for students who are carrying out charity expeditions after GBCE ceased trading and cancelled all of its services.

Even though Student Adventures is no longer operating, students who departed on Wednesday are scheduled to go ahead with their six-day climb of Mount Kilimanjaro, starting on Saturday, according to the Meningitis Research Foundation.

Parent Andy Robinson, from Leicester, said he is concerned about the well-being of his 19-year-old daughter, Hannah, but is hoping she will be able to achieve her goal of climbing Africa's highest mountain.

As the situation unfolded in the UK, the Plymouth University student was in transit in Tanzania and was supposed to begin her climb on Saturday.

Her father said: ‘I’m really concerned that she’s stuck in in Dar es Salaam and she can’t get out, but we’ll find out.

‘It’s a major trip and obviously it’s a concern anyway because climbing the highest free-standing mountain in the world is quite difficult.’

She managed to raise £3,400 for the Meningitis Research Foundation by collecting donations from family, friends and strangers while holding events in the community. 

Angry students took to Twitter to share their frustrations about the lack of information available 

University of Portsmouth students who are currently walking the Inca trail in Peru are safe and will continue their charity challenge with no problems, according to UPSU, the university’s students’ union.

UPSU said it believes the monies raised for the charities are already with the charities. 

Students, parents and charities have tried to get answers from GBCE, but the company is referring everyone to the Nottingham-based business recovery and insolvency team of Smith Cooper.

Other companies working with Student Adventures rushed to reassure customers in the wake of the closure

Student Adventures has deleted its Twitter and Facebook accounts. 

In a statement provided by Smith Cooper, Student Adventures assured parents and guardians that any students who are currently overseas are safe and arrangements are being made to bring them back to the UK. 

Jock Wright, the St Albans-based tour operator's events director, said in a statement: 'We regret to inform all of those who have booked with us that, unless you are informed to the contrary, all trips going forward are cancelled and all reservations are therefore also cancelled.

'We believe that any trips booked before March of this year are covered by its ATOL protection scheme and should be entitled for a full refund.'

The statement said the company is being placed into liquidation ‘despite the best efforts’ of its directors and stakeholders 

Students whose flights have not been cancelled would be travelling at their own risk and cost as no one will meet them at the airport and accommodations and excursions have not been arranged.

Charities - which could be left millions of pounds out of pocket - and student unions are urging those students not to travel. 

Wright added: ‘This is a great shock and extremely disappointing for many students who planned to fundraise for numerous charities.

‘However, we will be working with those who had bookings with GBCE to ensure that the necessary support is available to all of those who have been affected.'

University of Birmingham student Fay Lepley was scheduled to leave for Mount Kilimanjaro with about 30 others next Thursday after nearly a year of planning, but their trip has been scrapped.  

The 19-year-old said she has spent up to £2,500 on the trip, including about £1,500 paid directly to Student Adventures, while fundraising for the Meningitis Research Foundation.

She said: ‘It’s just so infuriating. So many people, my family, put so much into it. Even if I get the money back it doesn’t solve anything.’  

Danielle Horner, a recent graduate of the University of Portsmouth who was supposed to depart for Mount Kilimanjaro on Tuesday, said she is feeling frustrated.

The 21-year-old said: I’m absolutely gutted. I’m devastated because we’ve all put in so much hard work, so much time and so much money.’

She managed to raise over £3,000 for Practical Action.

She added: ‘I can only hope that the charities are going to get the full amount of money.’ 

Students who booked before GBCE's licence was revoked should be entitled to a refund under the ATOL scheme. They are also being told to contact their travel insurance provider, bank and credit card company. People who booked a trip using PayPal should contact that service for information about a possible refund.
