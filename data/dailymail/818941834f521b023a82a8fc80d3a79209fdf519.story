The 17-year-old high school wrestler from Washington accused of raping and murdering a 6-year-old girl has left a string of online posts about killing people and making children cry.

Gabriel Geata is facing charges of first-degree murder and first-degree rape of a child in connection to the slaying of Jenise Wright, who was found in a muddy bog in Bremerton a few days after her August 2 disappearance.

Prosecutors
 are awaiting a competency review before formally charging the 17-year-old suspect. He is 
expected to be tried as an adult.

Violent streak: Gabriel Gaeta reportedly wrote online about killing people and enjoying seeing chilldren cry

Loss: Jenise was last seen on August 2 and her body was found in a muddy boy by the FBI on August 7

Ominous: Gaeta wrote this post on Ask.fm a year before Jenise's killing

Ruthless: This reply stood out among Gaeta's other posts about school and his obsession with wrestling

Gaeta, a neighbor of the Wright family, was a star member of Olympic High School's wrestling team.

But the strapping teen depicted smiling in Facebook photographs reportedly had a violent streak that manifested itself off the wrestling mat, reported KIRO-TV.

In response to the question 'Wanna fight?' posted on the site Ask.fm, Gaeta wrote: 'No. I don't fight. I just kill people until the point where they're dead.'

Replying to another question, 'What's the latest thing that made you smile?' the high school student portentously wrote: 'A child crying.'

As the search for Jenise was in progress last week, a reporter for KIRO-TV briefly interviewed the teenage suspect's mother in her van. Gaeta was sitting impassively behind the wheel.

‘It’s very sad it feels like 9/11,' the woman said, describing her shell-shocked neighborhood. 'It’s very quiet and you don’t hear kids running around anymore. It’s sad.'

The teen's mother then broke burst into tears. Gabriel Gaeta said nothing and drove away.  

Jenise's body was found on August 7 after an intensive search involving hundreds of law enforcement officers and others.

An
 FBI team with search dogs discovered the girl's body covered by a small wood 
pallet and submerged in a muddy bog in woods near her Bremerton home.

Clues: Police found evidence near Jenise's body that linked her to the DNA of Gaeta, her neighbor 

She suffered blunt-force trauma to the head and was strangled and sexually assaulted, and that her body appeared to have been moved between a half-hour and three hours after she died. Her underwear and shorts were found 15-20 feet away from her remains.

Authorities said they linked evidence found near the girl's body to the DNA of Gaeta, a wrestling champion with no criminal history. A search of his bedroom turned up a blood- and mud-covered shirt and a bloody towel.

Gaeta made his first court appearance 
Monday and was ordered held on $1million bail after prosecutors said 
they had enough probable cause to detain him.

Kitsap County prosecutor Kelly Montgomery asked for the bail amount 'based on the heinous nature of the crime that is alleged.'

The
 judge also granted prosecutors' request for a mental-health evaluation 
of Gaeta. After the hearing, Kitsap County Prosecutor Russ Hauge said 
they sought the competency review to first determine whether they can 
charge the teen with anything.

Detectives
 interviewed the teen Saturday, during which time he 'clearly nodded 
yes' when they asked whether he was the only one involved, according to 
court documents.

Staying strong: James Wright, pictured with his wife Denise, said he has forgiven the 17-year-old neighbor accused of sexually assaulting and killing their six-year-old daughter Jenise earlier this month

'Certainly, as you can see from the probable cause statement, his interactions suggested that he knew that responsibility was rightfully focused on him,' Hauge said.

Katelynn Christenson and her friend Amanda Ungren, both 18, were among those who crowded the courtroom Monday for Gaeta's appearance.

The two said they went to the same junior high school as the suspect. They said they weren't close with him but saw no signs of violence.

'He was a nice kid,' said Christenson, who said she called her mother in tears when she heard who the suspect was.

James and Denise Wright reported 
Jenise missing on August 3. As authorities began investigating her 
disappearance, three children - aged eight, 12 and 16 - were removed 
from their care.

After she 
went missing, it emerged that James wright was arrested in 2000 on 
felony charges of child molestation in the first degree after an 
8-year-old girl said he inappropriately touched them after a night of 
drinking.

More than a 
year later, in June 2001, the charges were amended to include 
third-degree child molestation after a 15-year-old girl who was 
babysitting the girl during New Year's Eve 2000 said that Wright touched
 her breasts and put his hands down her pants.

The felony charges against Wright were eventually dropped, and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of assault relating to the older child, court records show.

A judge in Whatcom County Superior Court sentenced Wright to a year in jail but suspended the entire jail time provided he followed certain conditions, including paying fees.

The couple are now focusing on regaining custody of their children, whom state placed with two adult siblings in Bellingham.

They appeared at a hearing to regain custody on Monday and have another next week. In the meantime, they have been allowed visitation.

Mr Wright said he cannot start healing until the children are home.

'How can you put a puzzle back together if you don't have all the pieces?' he asked.
