The SAS is dead, long live the SAS. If there were fears Liverpool would lose their potency with the dissolving of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge’s partnership, a new double act may have emerged.

Sturridge and Raheem Sterling is not a partnership in the sense of the original SAS – that phrase was coined for Blackburn’s Chris Sutton and Alan Shearer in the 1990s – nor are they going to have an alliance like the one Sturridge and Suarez formed so thrillingly during the last 101-goal season.

But there have been glimpses this summer that Sturridge and Sterling, the men whose strikes gave Liverpool a crucial opening weekend win against Southampton, may yet develop a rapport that keeps Brendan Rodgers’ side in the thick of the top four.

New SAS? Raheem Sterling and Sturridge will be pivotal in attack for Liverpool this season

Hot prospect: Sterling showed huge potential last season but must back it up this year alongside Sturridge

This is a big season for both players. Sturridge has to show he can handle the responsibility of being the main man at a big club – his numbers certainly suggest he is up to the task – whereas Sterling must prove he can making another significant, stylish leap forward.

Judging on the evidence of this summer, and against Southampton, Sterling is primed to leave the form of his breakthrough campaign behind and establish himself not only as the number one young player in the country but one of the most exciting talents in Europe.

Sterling was the subject of much chatter before the game and one stalwart of the press room, a man who know knows what it means to pull on a red shirt, revealed his hopes for the 19-year-old when saying he had backed him to PFA Young Player of the Year – and for the top prize, too.

Attacking threat: Steven Gerrard will hope he can provide the service for Sterling and Sturridge up front

Given the way Sterling played in the game itself, it was easy to see why such a bold investment had been made. He took his goal with great aplomb, scampering onto a precise pass from Jordan Henderson, to slip his effort beyond Fraser Forster. It is likely to be the first of many this season.

‘When you’re so young, it’s important to understand exactly what your role is,’ Rodgers said last week. ‘It’s not just about looking good, you have to be efficient and effective. His development has gone to a new level. He’s way above the level from when he first came in.

The work rate and strength was as redoubtable as always but what really impressed in Sterling’s performance was his awareness and composure, late in the game, to jump up and head a ball into the path of Sturridge to score the winning goal.

Rodgers, caught up in the moment, sped on to the pitch and punched the air. This was a crucial victory, make no mistake, and while Suarez’s absence will be keenly felt, a significant amount of solace can be taken from the fact that Sturridge has a habit of producing at a rapid frequency.

‘That is 36 goals in 50 appearances, which is the best of any striker in Liverpool’s history,’ Rodgers pointed out. ‘That shows the level he is at. He always looks like he will score. It was a poacher’s goal, one of those where you anticipate a knockdown. It is now a continuation for him.’

When you consider some of the names he has eclipsed – Hunt, Dalglish, Rush, Fowler, Torres and Suarez – it is a remarkable achievement and shows the consistency he has achieved since his £12million move from Chelsea in January 2013.

Liverpool may need a new striker before the transfer window closes, with Radamel Falcao and Samuel Eto’o among the options being discussed, but their current first choice has built an impressive foundation for himself.

Gone: Liverpool sold Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million this summer but have a new SAS partnership

The next target would be surpass Fernando Torres, who reached 50 Barclays Premier League goals in 72 appearances, and with Sturridge - the top goalscorer in the top flight in 2014 - having bagged 32 in 44 matches, he must be odds-on to break that record, too, given the chances Liverpool can create when at their best.

Having Sterling providing pace, guile and another headache for opposing defenders to deal with might also help Sturridge’s cause and, if that is to be the case, the SAS would again become a recurring theme of Liverpool’s campaign.

Rodgers, for one, will be hoping that is the case. ‘We will get better,’ he beamed afterwards.

The men who scored Liverpool’s goals could also say the same.
