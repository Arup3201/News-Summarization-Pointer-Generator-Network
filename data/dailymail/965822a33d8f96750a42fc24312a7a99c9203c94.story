Locals in Bolton could not believe their eyes when they spotted a bright pink pigeon flying around their street.

David Taylor, 58, saw the unusual bird, which has white and pink plumage and a grey head, flying around the street as he ate his breakfast.

The regional sales manager, from Breightmet, captured the images of the bird only seconds before it flew away.

David Taylor photographed the unusual pink pigeon after it landed on the roof of his Bolton home

He said: 'I saw a pink bird on the roof on the house opposite me and I couldn’t believe my eyes.

'It looked very unusual so I grabbed my camera because I didn’t think anyone would believe me if I told them what I’d seen.

'I went back to get a picture but it had gone so I thought I’d missed my chance.

'Thankfully it re-appeared about 15 minutes later so I got the pictures quickly then it flew away.

'I’ve never heard of a pink pigeon before so who knows where its from.'

Gemma Pidluski, 27, posted images of the unusual bird on her Facebook account after it landed in her back garden.

Mr Taylor said he had to take a photograph of the unusual bird, with pink and white plumage and grey head because no-one would believe him otherwise

She said: 'I have just been sitting at home and a pink pigeon has landed on my shed roof. Is it real?

'I have googled it and sure enough there are pink pigeons.

'Bit of nice news for a change.'Another resident, Jackie Fish, thought the bird had been painted in tribute to the England World Cup squad after spotting it only minutes before they took to the field against Uruguay.Jackie, 57, said: “I just saw it there and realised it had been painted white and red, to look like the England flag.

'I have to say as supporting England goes, this is a bit too much and I would class it as cruelty and a bit beyond a joke if that was the case.'

There is a known breed of pink pigeon, called nesoenas mayeri, which are native to Mauritius, but they are incredibly rare and are almost completely white.

But the cause of the pigeon’s pink hue is not known, however, a diet of high levels of beta carotene and canthaxanthin which are harmless natural food pigments.
