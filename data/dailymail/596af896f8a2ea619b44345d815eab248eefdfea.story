British-born businessman Alan Bond has spoken for the first time since the suicide of his beloved wife Diana Bliss 20 months ago - and admitted that her death and other problems had brought him close to breaking point.

'I'm not over it yet,' the 75-year-old former high flier said in a reference to the time when Miss Bliss was found dead in the swimming pool of their mansion in Western Australia, a tragedy, he said had 'shattered' him.

Theatre producer Miss Bliss, 57, died 17 years after she and Bond were married in a high-profile wedding, a marriage he has always said changed his life for the better.

Miss Bliss had left a suicide note for Mr Bond - a controversial figure in business circles and who served four years in jail for fraud - in which she told him 'My love, I miss you. You will always be with me.'

Mr Bond, speaking to Australia's Channel 10 network from his countryside home in England - where he and Miss Bliss had spent so much time together - said that despite giving his wife all his care, he was unable to pull her out of her 'black spot'.

'You do the nurturing. For the 15 months before Di passed away I was a full-time carer for her.

'We never went out and with all the ability of the best medics in the world to treat her, we couldn't get through that barrier. She couldn't get through the barrier.'

London-born Mr Bond and Miss Bliss were married in 1992, three years after he divorced his first wife, Eileen - known in Perth's social circles as 'Big Red' - and in the same year that he was declared bankrupt with personal debts of more than £300 million.

He told the Revealed show in the TV interview that Diane used to love it in their English home.

'I tried to get her out of her dark spot by bringing her here and she loved the walks. It's just a peaceful place.'

It was after he had put bankruptcy and jail time behind him, he settled down to a peaceful life with Miss Bliss - but it was not to be.

For his eldest daughter, Suzanne Bond, was found in her Perth home a day after Mr Bond had returned from London in 2000.

'It was about eight months after Diana's death. I came out of the Farm Street Church in London where I had just lit some candles for Di and for Susan, when I was walking back to the hotel and all of a sudden it just lifted. It was like you reach a point and it lifts.

'I think it's a question of are you going to give up, or are you going to go the next 100 yards of your life? And for me, giving up is not really an option.'

It was Mr Bond who was behind Australia's victory over the US in the America's Cup 30 years ago - a 'David and Goliath story,' he said - but it was an event that contributed to his financial and legal troubles.

'It made me identifiable all over the world,' he told the TV station.

'If I could achieve a win in the America's cup, is there anything I couldn't do?

'The reality of that is I think the ego got a bit ahead of myself and I really did take on some fantastic projects.

'I became known to all the bankers in the world and they threw money at me.'

Now, he says he is just getting on with life.

'I think you have to show that you're bigger than the problems and get on with your life - and make something of your life, which is exactly what I'm doing.'

Tragic: Mr Bond is believed to battled desperately to revive his wife, a former air stewardess, and called an ambulance for her

Ms Bliss, who had worked as a Qantas flight attendant, in public relations and later as a successful theatre producer, married Bond in 1995 after he had been discharged as a bankrupt.

He was divorced from his first wife, Eileen, three years earlier.

Bond, 73, who emigrated with his parents from London to Australia in 1950, began as a signwriter but went on to become a multi-millionaire whose investments in airships, property, breweries and diamond mines enabled him to bankroll challenges for the America’s Cup, the premier international yacht race.

In 1983, his Australia II Syndicate won the trophy, which had been  held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851.

In 1987, Bond controversially bought Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for £36 million – at the time the highest price paid for a single painting.

But the purchase was subsidised by a substantial loan from auctioneer Sotheby’s, which Bond failed to repay. Art experts suggested it may have been a manipulated sale designed to artificially inflate the value.

After his empire collapsed, Bond was declared bankrupt in 1992 with personal debts of £1.2 billion.

He was jailed for seven years in 1997 after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in the Bell Resources company to siphon off more than £800 million into the coffers of his Bond Corporation.

He served four years in jail and since then he has worked with his son, Craig, to build up a new fortune in oil and diamonds.

By 2008, Bond was said to be worth about £170 million.
