Juan Mata has described Manchester United's impressive opening 45 minutes against Tottenham as 'arguably our best half of the season'.

The Spanish playmaker, who was included in Louis van Gaal's starting line-up to face Tottenham after being named on the substitutes' bench for Manchester United's last seven games, was part of the side which raced into a 3-0 lead after just 34 minutes.

And Mata, writing in his weekly blog, has said he was extremely pleased with his side's style of play during the opening exchanges of Sunday's match at Old Trafford.

'It was a very important victory in order to finish in the top four, since Tottenham are also in the same race. It was arguably our best first half of the season.

'In those 45 minutes we got three goals and we could have scored some more. The team played with a fast, intense and vertical style, also pressing on Spurs’ half of the pitch.

'I was very happy for the fans after the disappointment in the FA Cup against Arsenal last Monday.

'The best way to recover was by playing a good game and winning for the fans, and that’s what we gave to them - to you - against Tottenham, a very good team that we managed to neutralise.'

The 26-year-old has called on his team-mates to maintain their focus during United's final nine Premier League games of the season and lavished praise on the Old Trafford crowd.

He added: 'We must focus on each of the remaining games, and they are not many, in order to achieve our goal which is to bring the Champions League back to Old Trafford. 

Mata was delighted with the reception he received from the Old Trafford faithful on Sunday afternoon

'Some of our rivals are also fighting for the same but I hope this win against Tottenham will give us confidence to perform at our highest level.

'I heard your applause and I want to thank you for that. Ever since my first day as a United player I felt the love from Old Trafford and I want you to know that it helps a lot when you play.

'Your applause when I was substituted and on my way to the dressing room is something I will never forget.'
