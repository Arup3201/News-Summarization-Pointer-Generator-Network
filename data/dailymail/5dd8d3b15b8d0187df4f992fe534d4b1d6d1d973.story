It's the picture no woman wants taken - semi-naked in bed after a night out, messy hair and make-up smeared across her face as she lies asleep.

But more and more shameless men are sneakily snapping pictures of their sleeping one-night stands and posting them online for thousands of followers to see.

The new social networking trend - dubbed #bedofshame - has emerged on Twitter and has left women across the land reeling.

Trend: A man pulls a face on his camera with a women asleep in the the background and posts it on Twitter

Thumbs up: Men pose next their sleeping partners but the trend has not impressed many women

Geordie Shore reality TV star Gary Beadle unwittingly sparked #bedofshame a few days ago but today he apologised after his comment prompted a furious online backlash.

He inspired the trend when he asked his 500,000 followers: 'How many people r doing the walk of shame hahahaha #wakeupwitharandom #awkwardtaxihome.'

Just seconds later responses poured in with hundreds of men posting photos of their 
half-dressed 'conquests' sleeping in the background.

Many were smiling and were pictured with their thumbs up. Beadle has since been dubbed a 'hero' and 'legend' by his Twitter fans.

However, in a statement today he urged people to delete the images after some women branded it 'sickening' and 'disgusting'. Others got their own back by posting pictures of men lying next to them asleep.

@xcandystripesx tweeted: #bedofshame is shocking and NOT acceptable!this is a form of abuse and is disrespectful towards women!'

Meanwhile, @Sarymclary wrote: 'Rather sickened by #bedofshame trend. Would be interested to know the 
legal implications for posting naked images of people w/out consent?'

‏And @PetraPahlavi said: 'im not a prude but #bedofshame is just disgusting...how wld u feel it it was ur sister/cousin being pic'd across TWITTER'.

Beadle said in a statement: 'I am sorry to anyone who’s been offended by my recent behaviour on Twitter. I’d like to apologise to fans of Geordie Shore, my Twitter followers, my fellow cast members and to MTV.   

'I have really let myself down….all I can do is apologise and ask that anyone that has posted photos or comments to please delete them.  I’ve already done the same.'

However, many men were quick to defend the trend, describing it as a 'laugh' and 'banter'. ‏
