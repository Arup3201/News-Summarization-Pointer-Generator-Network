A political debate turned physical in California yesterday as one of the two Democratic candidates for congress grabbed the other by the shoulder, challenging him to a fight.

Brad Sherman and Howard Berman were mid-debate when Mr Sherman suddenly grabbed his opponent and shouted: ‘You want to get into this?’

The heated moment came during a debate at a college in Woodland Hills, San Fernando Valley, as the pair stepped up their 
game in the competition for a Los Angeles seat.

debate at a Senior Center in California the day before the 'fight'

A video of the tussle was released on Howard Berman’s YouTube account by his campaign manager, accompanied with a press release headlined ‘Has Brad Sherman lost his mind?’, which led to the opposing side accusing them of a smear campaign.

What the video does not show is that moments earlier, during a dispute on an immigration-related bill, Mr Berman, 71, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, had called Mr Sherman ‘delusional’ and ‘liar’.

Congressman Berman, seen on the left in the video, then stepped close to Mr Sherman, 57, on the stage, who told his colleague loudly, ‘Get out of my face.’

A few seconds later in Mr Sherman is seen taking a hold of Mr Berman in front of an increasingly riled audience.

The two men later stood nose-to-nose 
exchanging words before a sheriff's deputy emerged behind them and 
briefly placed his hand on Sherman's shoulder after which the pair 
separated.

Firestarter: The debate between the congressmen get heated as the pair square up against each other

At the close of 
the debate, held at Pierce College, Woodland Hills, Berman said: ‘We are in a heated and expensive race. It's 
become a very emotional race.

'We [each] think that when smears are made,
and when untruths are said, a person has to defend himself and that 
raises the intensity of debate.’

The
move by Howard Berman’s team to release the video is 
just the latest stunt in an increasingly nasty campaign for congress.

It
has seen a series of competing accusations, ranging from suggestions of
ethical impropriety to fleecing taxpayers. 

Earlier Thursday, two former
secretaries of state, George Shultz and Madeleine Albright, released a 
letter defending Berman for taking overseas trips following criticism 
from Sherman's campaign.

In response to the video, Parke 
Skelton, Mr Sherman's campaign manager, refuted the claims that Congressman
Sherman attacked his opponent.

‘Sherman
did not challenge Berman. Congressman Sherman was reacting to Berman leaving 
his table, coming over to where Sherman's was seated and calling him a 
"liar" and "delusional."

'Mr Skelton said that Congressman Sherman asked 
his opponent to step away and the grab was a result of Mr Berman 
refusing to do so.’

'You want to get into this?': Congressman Sherman puts his arm around his opponents shoulder and shouts in his face

Release: The woman grabs Mr Sherman's arm and he lets go of Congressman Berman's shoulder

He 
added: ‘Clearly the context is that Sherman is upset that Berman has 
come over to where Sherman was and is getting in his face and calling 
him names. Sherman is asking Berman why he is behaving the way he is.’

Mr Skelton also accuses Congressman Berman’s campaign manager Brandon Hall of turning the exchange ‘into something it was not.'

‘Brandon's release makes a number of 
misstatements and exaggerations. Sherman did not put Berman in a 
headlock. A Sheriff did not escort Sherman from the premises. Both 
parties calmed down and the debate continued.’

‘Not a good day for a consultant when you have to deny that your candidate put someone in a headlock. ‘

Get a load of this guy: Mr Sherman continues to attack with a raised voice having let go of Mr Berman

Head to head: The pair go against each other once more on stage

Two ways: An officer and the moderator go between them and the pair separate

Mr
Sherman himself said in a statement that the debate ‘was not conducted 
at the highest level.'

He said: 'I regret my part in allowing emotions to distract 
from the exchange of views.’

The veteran lawmakers were pulled into the same district after a voter-approved independent panel redrew California's political boundaries.

They were the top vote-getters in the June primary and went on to the general election because of California's new primary system, which sends the top two finishers to the runoff regardless of party affiliation.

Their race for the 30th district seat is one of eight same-party congressional runoffs on California's November ballot.

Another, in the San Francisco Bay area, involves Democratic Rep. Pete Stark, the longest-serving member of the state's congressional delegation.
