A drama of unimaginable horror unfolded on a quiet residential street in Birmingham when a teenage boy allegedly launched a frenzied knife attack on his mother and two sisters, leaving all three with multiple wounds.

Shocked neighbours described the scene in Small Heath as 'like something out of a horror film', with one claiming to have seen part of the attack on his CCTV system.

He watched as one girl, just 10 years old, was dragged in a headlock into the street and stabbed multiple times in the upper body and neck. She then tried to crawl to a neighbour's house for help, he said.

The scene on Little Green Lane, Small Heath, Birmimgham, where a woman and two children were found stabbed on Wednesday morning

A
 teaching assistant and caretaker from the primary school across the 
road from the house raced to help the little girl as she lay in agony.

Her older brother, aged 17, calmly stood and watched nearby before being taken away by police, witnesses said.

The mother, one claimed, was stabbed in the eye.

The 10-year-old was airlifted to hospital where her injuries were described by police as 'serious' while her 16-year-old sister and their mother were taken to hospital by ambulance.

Police were called to an address in Little Green Lane at 7.20am on Wednesday by a resident who reported hearing screams.

A statement said: 'Officers arrived at the scene within a matter of minutes and arrested a 17-year-old in the street and recovered a knife nearby. He has been taken to hospital having suffered a minor cut to his hand.

'A woman in her 40s and a teenage girl - believed to be aged 16 - were found inside a house with knife injuries whilst a younger girl, 10, was found on the pavement with stab injuries.'

A baby was discovered unharmed inside the address and is currently being cared for by family members.

Chief Inspector Dean Hatton, of Birmingham Central Police, said: 'All three casualties have suffered multiple knife wounds and have been taken to hospital for emergency treatment. The two girls are in a serious condition, whilst their mother is described as stable.

'This appears to be a contained, domestic incident: the teenager was arrested outside the address and we are not actively seeking anyone else in connection with the incident.'

The stabbing occurred on the same road in which 75-year-old Mohammed Saleem was murdered last April.

The house where today's three victims were attacked is directly opposite the family home of Mr Saleem.

Ukrainian Pavlo Lapshyn was sentenced to 40 years in prison after admitting his murder.

Shahid Saleem, 41, was stunned when he heard screaming and checked his private CCTV cameras - only to see the attack unfolding on camera.

He said: 'I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was frozen to the spot.

‘I
 saw a woman with short dark hair run over to the girl - I recognised 
her as one of the teachers at the primary school across the road.

‘At
 that point I ran out to help - there were lots of neighbours running 
around, tending to the two sisters. The boy was just sitting in the 
road. He was completely dead behind the eyes.

‘The police arrived and lead him away, he went willingly, and the paramedics started working on the girls straight away. The air ambulance came for her.‘

‘It was horrendous to witness. I just hope all three of them are ok.

‘The father is working away in Saudi Arabia, so the boy was left as man of the house.

‘They had only recently moved back into the house, which they had been letting out, because they were trying to sell it, so the whole family could move back to Saudi.’

Farah Naz, 45, who lives nearby, said: 'I heard someone screaming, it sounded like they were terrified and in pain, so I sent my son to see what was going on.

'He came tearing back to the house and told me I needed to go and help. I ran round the corner and there was a girl lying in the doorway.

'She was covered in blood and it looked like she had been stabbed in the neck.There was blood everywhere. It was like a scene from a horror film.

'There were two people kneeling over her, comforting her, it was the caretaker from the primary school and a teaching assistant.

'They kept telling her it was going to be OK. Then all the emergency services arrived and it was a bit of a blur.'

Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, spoke of her shock.

She said: ‘Nothing like this has ever happened here before, I am in total shock, I just don’t know what to do with myself.

‘I was getting ready to go to work, it was just after 7am I think and I heard these screams, these really high pitched screams.

‘It was like something from a horror movie, they were deafening, I looked out of my window but I couldn’t see anything.

‘I was scared, I knew something bad had happened so I didn’t leave my house, then within minutes I saw police cars and ambulance pulling up.

‘For this to happen so close to the primary school too is just dreadful, I doubt any of the little ones were on their way to school at that time, although an hour later and they would have seen everything.

‘I hope the victims pull through, I don’t know how they are and didn’t see them but like I said it was just horrible and I am in total shock.

‘Those screams will be something that will stay with me forever and I am just praying the girls and the woman make a full recovery as quickly as possible.’

Birmingham MP Shabana Mahmood spoke out against 'senseless violence' in society after hearing of today's incident in Small Heath.

The Labour MP for Ladywood said: 'This awful news is shocking and my prayers are with the family.

'Senseless and mindless violence such as this must be challenged and rooted out wherever it occurs.'

The three-bedroom end-terrraced house where the attack took place is currently on the market.

The property is being advertised on Rightmove.com with pictures of the inside of the family home.

It has two reception rooms, three bedrooms, kitchen and upstairs bathroom along with a rear garden.

One picture of the living room shows two red sofas along with plastic children's toys piled in the corner.

A girl's teenage bedroom upstairs is painted pink with fashionable clothes hanging on a rack.

Make-up and school books are visible on the white desk opposite a bunk bed.

Another bedroom is painted blue and has a picture of a London double-decker bus hanging on the wall opposite another bunk bed.
