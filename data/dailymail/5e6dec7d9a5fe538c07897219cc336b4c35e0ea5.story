She is notoriously one of the hardest 
partying girls in showbusiness thanks to her fondness for hitting every event 
on the social scene with A-list pals like One Direction and Mollie King.

But Laura Whitmore has put her partying days to one side whilst she focuses on her new day job: modelling a new line of clothing for George at Asda.

The 27-year-old presenter-turned-clothes horse has been called in to
model the supermarket giant's new G21 Talent label for the second time.

Back to the day job: She may be a party girl and a frequent face on the social scene, but Laura Whitmore proves she can focus on the day job too as she poses in the new G21 Talent label from George at Asda

The collection of fast fashion clothing is designed by talent handpicked from Graduate Fashion 
Week in a hope to nurture new fashion talent.

Fiona Lambert, George Brand Director, said: 'Not only will we be providing a platform for graduates to showcase their great work to potential employers at Graduate Fashion Week. 

'We will also be bringing together the cream of the fashion crop and collaborating with them to launch a brand new and exclusive label to George, titled G21 Talent.'

Laura, who is a regular on the front rows of fashion week, will be seen modelling collections from five hotly tipped style stars of the future; Claire Acton, Chloe Jones, Jessica Piper, Frankie Quinn and Chloe Horsfield.

Model behaviour: George has called Laura in to help showcase the clothes designed by graduates in a hope to launch numerous careers and enhance the development of graduates

Claire Acton and Chloe Jones collections’ were launched in March 2013 with Jessica Piper launching 21st May 2013 and Frankie Quinn and Chloe Horsfield to follow later this year-  each of whom will be fully mentored 
through the design process, with the opportunity to shadow George’s team
 of designers.

In these particular shots, Laura can 
be seen posing in styles by Jessica Piper who translated her graduate range into a 
high-street collection inspired by a fusion of art and skateboarding.

Focusing on bright colours, loud 
signature prints and intricate details Jessica has created a range of 
playful relaxed garments that can be simply thrown together for any 
occasion.

The collections will be priced between £12-£18, staying true to Asda's good value price point.

Retailing exclusively in selected Asda stores nationwide, the new range will not only be available in the UK but also internationally in George franchising stores in the Middle East and online across the UK and Europe at George.com.

'We recently announced the expansion of George.com into 24 European Countries.  What’s really exciting is that as a result of this growth we are giving graduates the chance to showcase their talent globally, giving them a platform to sell their collections around the world, not just in the UK,' added Fiona.

Exclusive: Retailing exclusively in selected Asda stores nationwide, the new range will not only be available in the UK but also internationally in George franchising stores. From L-R: Tee: £8, top £12, shorts £12
