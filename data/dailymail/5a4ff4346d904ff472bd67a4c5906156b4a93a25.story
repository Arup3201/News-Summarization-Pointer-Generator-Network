Jubilant Arsenal fans will greet their team later today as they celebrate their record-equaling 11th time following a thrilling extra-time victory over Hull City.

The team will hold a victory parade for the first time since Arsenal moved to their new stadium in 2006.

The north London team had a hard journey to the FA Cup final with victories over Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton.

With Arsenal two goals down within the first eight minutes it seemed that their nine-year trophy drought was going to continue for at least another twelve agonising months. 

But as soon as Aaron Ramsey scored the extra-time winner, the red part of north London was sent into rapture.

Manager Arsene Wenger admitted after the final whistle that he was preparing to sign a new contract and remain on as Arsenal's most successful manager in history.

However, as the fans celebrated in the stands, Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski walked up behind his manager and showered Wenger in beer.

The victory is the first silverware to be added to the club's trophy cabinet since leaving Highbury.

Wenger
 had insisted the result at Wembley would have no bearing on his 
decision to stay at the club but confirmed after the victory he would be
 remaining at the Emirates.

'I always said my future doesn't depend on this but I always wanted to stay,' Wenger told ITV when asked if he was staying before saying, 'Yes, I will.'

He added: 'We wanted to make history tonight and win the game and we did that in both ways - how not to start the Cup final and how to come back,' Wenger said.

'I think it was a turning point in the life span of this team - to know they can win in that way was really important today.

'It would have been terrible [to lose] but we came back. I've praised the spirit of this team and they showed that today. Congratulations to Hull they played fantastically the whole game.'

Match-winner Aaron Ramsey had trouble keeping his emotions in check after the thrilling game and admitted he feared the worst when Hull raced into a two-goal lead.

'I am getting a bit emotional and I am not usually,' the Welsh midfielder said. 

'I get emotional thinking about it. We have conceded early in lots of big games this season, but we showed great strength of character to come back and to score the winner is something I have dreamed off.

'This one is for the manager and the fans who have already believed in us, even when things have not gone well for us.'

Jack Wilshere revealed Hull's quick-fire start to the match caused him to feel sick but was glad the team could win the cup for their long-suffering fans.

'We never do it easy. In the first half, I was sitting on the bench, and I felt sick,' he said.

'Second half we were in control but this 
win is for the Arsenal fans. Kieran Gibbs pulled his calf at the end but that 
shows his character as he stayed on, it's fantastic.'

Losing Hull manager Steve Bruce was proud of his players' efforts but was disappointed with some refereeing decisions which cost the team.

'I couldn't ask more from my players. The vast majority are ones that got us out the Championship,' Bruce said.

'It could have been a memorable season. In terms of effort and determination you couldn't fault them, we didn’t have enough but I'm proud, they were magnificent.

'Their first goal wasn't a free-kick, the second one wasn't a corner. But now is not the time to whine. We had a wonderful opportunity.
