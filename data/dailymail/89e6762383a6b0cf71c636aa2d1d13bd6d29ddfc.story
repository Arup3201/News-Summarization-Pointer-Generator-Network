Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, while not mentioning the Commander in Chief by name, took a shot at President Barack Obama on Thursday during a Washington, D.C. area gathering for conservatives over the Democratic leader's staunch refusal to characterize extremists in the Middle East as 'radical Islamic' terrorists.

Taking his turn on the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a testing ground for Republican presidential hopefuls, Walker told the confab's attendees, the country needs a leader 'who stands up and realizes that radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom-loving people around the world.' 

'We need a president, a leader, who will stand up and say, "we will take the fight to them, and not wait for them to take the fight to us," ' Walker added. 

And according to Walker, he may very well be that leader, having had to take on nearly 100,000 angry union members in his first term.

Wisconsin Gov.Scott Walker speaking at the 42nd annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, just down the river from Washington, D.C, said his battle with labor unions as Wisconsin's governor had given him the mettle needed to take on militant groups like Islamic State

Walker burst into the national spotlight when in his first term he took on public sector unions. His administration's reforms, backed by the state legislature, to their health and pension systems incited a recall election, which he handily won. 

During a question and answer portion of his session on Thursday, Walker, when asked how he would handle the conflict with ISIS if he were in charge of the military, invoked his 2012 victory over state and national unions.

The likely 2016 presidential candidate, currently surging in the polls with Republican voters in early primary states, said that like most parents, he wants a Commander in Chief, 'who will do everything in their power to make sure the that threat from radical Islamic terrorists do not wash up on American soil.'

Repeating his earlier statements, the father of two teenage sons said the country needs a military commander with the 'kind of confidence' to fight terrorists where they are.

He then said: 'If I can do that with 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,' seemingly comparing critics of his policies in Wisconsin - some of whom showed up at CPAC and tried to shout him down - to violent extremists pillaging the Middle East.

The Democratic National Committee immediately pounced on the remarks, contending in an email to reporters they prove the 47-year-old Republican isn't ready for prime time.

'If Scott Walker thinks that it's appropriate to compare working people speaking up for their rights to brutal terrorists, then he is even less qualified to be president than I thought,' DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee said.

'Maybe he should go back to punting,' Elleithee added, referring to Walker's evasions in the past of questions he didn't want to answer.

On one of those occasions when Walker was pressed to give his beliefs on evolution he asked his interviewer if he could 'punt' and refused to put his views on record.

A spokesperson for Walker's political action committee, Leadership Matters, later told Daily Mail Online that the governor 'was in no way comparing any American citizen to ISIS.'

'Governor Walker believes our fight against ISIS is one of the most important issues our country faces,' the spokeswoman, Kristen Kukowski, said in an email.

'What the governor was saying was when faced with adversity he chooses strength and leadership. Those are the qualities we need to fix the leadership void this White House has created.'

Walker was among friends and spent the bulk of his speech ticking off support for issues that are important to his base, including right to work and voter ID laws. He also slapped President Barack Obama down, though not by name, for refusing to call ISIS extremists 'radical Islamic terrorists'

At Thursday's conference, surrounded conservative voters from across the country who share his values, Walker was among friends and spent the bulk of his speech ticking off support for issues that are important to his base, including right to work and voter ID laws.

Walker at one point said Americans need a president 'who will stand with Israel' - another blow intended for the current occupant of the Oval Office.

Like Walker, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also visiting the U.S.' Capitol City this weekend for a conference. He will make remarks at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual gathering and address a joint session of Congress while he is stateside.

Obama won't meet with Netanyahu while he is in Washington, however, because he is competing to reelection later this month, and the White House worries that Obama would appear to be inappropriately influencing the contest if he were to open his arms and invite him to the White House.

Walker on Thursday slammed Obama for the move, saying the country needs a leader who will show the the head of state of a longtime ally like Israel with 'respect' when he requests to visit.

Technically, it was House Speaker John Boehner who invited Netanyahu to Washington. 

Boehner independently sent an invitation to the world leader, without the White House's knowledge, drawing ire from Democrats, dozens of whom plan to boycott his Tuesday address, during which he will make the case for additional sanctions on regional foe, Iran.
