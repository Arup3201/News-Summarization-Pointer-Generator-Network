Daniel Sturridge insists Liverpool will come back stronger after their Champions League group-stage exit  - and the England forward is working hard to get back fit for Brendan Rodgers' men.

The 25-year-old watched from his warm-weather fitness training camp in Los Angeles as Liverpool drew 1-1 with Basle, meaning they will now play in the Europa League.

And he revealed how gutted he was about the loss but vowed that the Reds would learn from it and come back stronger.

He tweeted: 'We fought hard man. Sat here devastated wishing I could have helped.

'We'll come back stronger from this and I'm working hard to do the same.'

Sturridge is currently out with a thigh injury - a setback suffered during his recovery from a similar problem - and has not played since the beginning of September.

And the former Manchester City and Chelsea striker posted photos on Instagram earlier in the week showing him during a fitness session as he bids to return early in 2015.

He has made just three appearances for Liverpool this season.

During the match on Tuesday night, Steven Gerrard's magnificent free-kick was not enough to see Liverpool through due to Fabian Frei's first-half goal at Anfield for Basle.

To compound the Reds' misery, substitute Lazar Markovic was also sent off for catching a Basle player with a flailing arm.

Skipper Gerrard even revealed how important Sturridge can be for Liverpool - and also stressed the need for Mario Balotelli to step it up for the club.

Following the match, Gerrard said: ‘You always qualify over the six games and unfortunately we haven't been good enough.

'We need to get our main striker Daniel Sturridge back and get some more goals in the side. We need to get Mario Balotelli back and firing.'
