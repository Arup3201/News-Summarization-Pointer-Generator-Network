Authorities believe the posts about gun laws and the Wikipedia corrections were made by Sandy Hook murderer Adam Lanza

Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza was obsessed with correcting Wikipedia entries about mass killers, authorities believe.

They are investigating whether a series of posts about firearms on gun message boards were uploaded by the 17-year-old Lanza.

In one entry, the poster, who is suspected to be Lanza, wrote that he had a 'fetish' for .32 ACP bullets.

Gun obsessed Lanza killed 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, last year.

The 20-year-old first shot his mother Nancy four times in the head before the rampage began - the worst school killing in American history.

Lanza used two semi-automatic pistols, a Glock and Sig Sauer before taking his own life.

Investigators andÂ The Courant have now linked Lanza to the series of posts and the Wikipedia editing.

The posts were made between April, 2009, and February, 2010, and if, as suspected, they were made by Lanza, they reveal his deep obsession with American mass shootings and the weapons used.

Some of the posts question gun laws in Connecticut and include recommendations on the best rifles to buy.

In one post, the person believed to be Lanza, questions whether a ban on semiautomatic pistols will be extended and is advised by other users to contact Connecticut State Police.

He responds: 'I always prefer asking through proxy when I can avoid speaking to someone directly. I was just wondering if anyone knew because I have a fetish for .32 ACP', reports The Courant.

Using the same username, the person also corrected details on 12 Wikipedia entries about mass shootings around the world.

They included changing the weapon used
in the Dawson College shooting in Montreal in 2006, in which one 
student was killed and 19 others wounded.

The
Courant said the user, suspected to be Lanza, wrote in the revision 
notes: '"9mm" was listed as ".9mm." People say that 9mm is anemic, but 
this is ridiculous.'

Lanza murdered 20 young children and six adults during a shooting rampage at Sandy Hook School

Investigators believe Lanza is behind the obsessive editing of 12 Wikipedia entries about mass shootings and they recovered articles on Norway murderer Anders Breivik (right)

Entries on the shopper center shootings at the Sello Mall near Helsinki, Finland, in 2009, and the Omaha Westroads mall shooting in 2007 were also edited.

An entry on the ESL Inc. massacre in 1988 was also changed.

Seven people were killed and seven more injured at the manufacturing company in Sunnyvale, California and gunman Richard Farley's methods bear a clear similarity to Lanza's.

Both men strapped hundreds of rounds of ammunition on a vest and wore earplugs before the mass shootings.

Lanza is already known to have harboured an interest in mass shootings and police have previously found a New York Times cut out in his room about the murder of five people at Northern Illinois University.

Articles about Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011 in Norway, were also recovered.
