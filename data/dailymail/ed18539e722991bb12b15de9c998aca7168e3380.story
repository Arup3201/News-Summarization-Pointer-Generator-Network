Queensland police who were investigating Allison Baden-Clay's death have revealed they bugged the flowers next to her coffin in the hope of luring a private confession from Gerard at her funeral.

As Baden-Clay spent his first night in prison serving out a life sentence for killing his wife, police revealed how closely they scrutinised the man who yesterday was found guilty of murder in the Brisbane Supreme Court.

The Courier Mail reports that police thought Baden-Clay might break down if he was alone with Allison's coffin, and offer a confession.

Police bugged the flowers on Allison's coffin - but the plan was scuppered when Gerard arrived late to the service with their three daughters

But his late arrival to the service with his children scuppered that plan, the paper reports.

Police followed a number of leads - including grainy CCTV footage from the night of Allison's disappearance which may have shown her car at a roundabout near in Brisbane's west, and evidence which pointed to more than one person being near Kholo Creek, where her body was eventually discovered on April 30, 2012.

Red marks on Baden-Clay's face proved to be the strongest lead for detectives as they charged him with his wife's murder.

Baden-Clay told police he had cut himself shaving with a blunt razor because he was in a rush to get ready the morning of Allison's disappearance, but forensic experts testified in court they were more likely caused by fingernail scratches.

Police also reveal they tapped phone calls between Baden-Clay and his mistress, Toni McHugh.

It comes as A Current Affair reported that the Baden-Clays' three daughters - now left without a mother and a father - have been visiting Gerard behind bars at the Arthur Gorrie facility once a month in the lead-up to the trial, accompanied by their paternal grandparents.

Once a month, since their father was charged and taken into custody, the girls have been visiting Baden-Clay behind bars in the Arthur Gorrie facility where he was being held, awaiting trial, A Current Affair reported. They were accompanied by their paternal grandparents.

In her witness impact statement, Allison's mother Priscilla Dickie said her granddaughters still wept over the loss of their mother.

Ms Dickie said she and her husband, Geoffrey, were 'a happily retired couple involved in church and community activities' before their daughter's untimely death, but now their daily lives consisted of 'school days, special school events, and many before and after school activities'.

'[The girls] resilience to this tragedy is a result of [Allison's] guidance and love,' Ms Dickie said.

'They miss her terribly and cry for her every night.

'They've been condemned to a life sentence without the love and companionship only a mother can give.

'What can you do or say when dealing with the stress of hugging a little girl saying: "I want my mummy!" and answering the question, "Does mummy love me?"'

Overnight, the horrific actions of Gerard Baden-Clay on April 19, 2012, left the girls motherless but on Tuesday a guilty verdict also took away their father.

Allison Baden-Clay's daughters will now grow up under the care of her parents and sister, Vanessa Fowler, who has moved from the Gold Coast to be closer to her nieces in Brisbane.

The court heard, Ms Fowler had 'willingly' taken up the responsibility to be one of the sole carers of the Baden-Clay children by uprooting her own family - including her husband and two kids - to help her parents look after the three girls.

'My role in the family has changed from being the eldest daughter to being a support and carer of my three nieces,' she said in her victim impact statement.

Outside court the family's close friend, Kerry Anne Walker, said: 'Our primary concern has always been and remains the physical and emotional wellbeing of Allison's three beautiful girls.'

'We will help them to rebuild their lives and ask for your support, co-operation and privacy in order to do this.

'We have a long way to go to ensure that they will cope with a future without their mother.'

But support will not just come from immediate family members.

As their mother - who has been described as a 'quiet achiever' by friends - gave to the community, they will return the favour by helping Allison's daughters through this difficult time.

Dee Hudson and Roni Johnson are two people who are part of the efforts to raise money for the children of the devoted mother and keeping her legacy alive.

'Alison was just like us - she was a mother, she was a daughter, she was wife,' Ms Hudson, a school friend, told A Current Affair.

'I felt distressed for her children.

'I want to...let those little girls start seeing their mum's light shining in the public eye.'

To honour their friend, Ms Hudson and Ms Johnson are urging people to wear yellow on August 1 for Wear Yellow Day for Allison and Strive to be Kind.
