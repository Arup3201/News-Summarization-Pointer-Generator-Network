A Florida couple is accused of child neglect after their three children were found walking in the woods alone -- while their parents may have been under the influence of crystal meth.

Michael Scott Butcher, a 30-year-old former Alabama cop who has previously been linked to drug possession, and his wife Sarah were arrested after their red truck was illegally parked in a Florida RV park on Friday, NBC2 News reports.

The couple seemed out of place in the community on Friday evening, according to witness Arthur Giasson.

'The young man seemed to be quite agitated,' Giasson told the channel. 'Talking in a loud manner and just acting strangely.' He claims he saw the man banging on peoples' doors, demanding to be let in.

Michael Butcher and wife Sarah, pictured, were arrested for loitering on Friday evening in an RV park. Crystal meth was also allegedly found in the couple's truck

After a security guard tried to get the couple to leave, 911 was called.

The couple reportedly held valid Alabama drivers' licenses, but their truck registration was out of date, according to Fox4Now. 

During a search of their vehicle, cops reportedly found crystal meth in the Butchers' glove compartment, as well as a syringe and a burnt needle, according to WZVN.

The Butchers were arrested for loitering or prowling.

When taken to jail, the Butchers repeatedly claimed to be siblings. Meth was also reportedly found in Michael Butcher's pocket at the jail, the channel adds.

The couple's truck was illegally parked at Water's Edge RV park, seen here. Their children, ages 6, 8, and 10, were later found in the woods walking alone

Michael Butcher reportedly 'banged' on neighbors' doors in the RV park, demanding to be let in. When the couple's car was searched, meth, a syringe and a burnt needle were reportedly found

The cops then received a phone call from another deputy, saying he'd located three children in the words near the RV park who identified their missing parents as Michael and Sarah.

The children reportedly were dropped off in the woods as the parents drove off, authorities said. The children are ages 6, 8, and 10.

Cops said the family appeared to be be living out of the truck, which was  full of syringes and old food, NBC2 reports.

The couple is held without bond. Michael Butcher was charged with possession of a controlled substance. He and his wife were both charged with child neglect.

Michael Butcher reportedly resigned from the Jasper Police Department in 2012 after he was arrested for unlawful possession of a controlled substance, Daily Mountain Eagle reported at the time. Authorities were also made aware that Butcher was possibly involved in criminal activity in the city.
