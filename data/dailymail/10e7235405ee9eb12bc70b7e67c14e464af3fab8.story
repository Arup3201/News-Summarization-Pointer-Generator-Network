A bear hunt is under way in Florida after a woman was mauled while out walking her dogs, it was reported today.

The woman, from the central 
Florida town of Longwood, was being treated at Orlando Regional Medical 
Center for serious but non-life-threatening injuries.

Authorities 
did not release her name, but said no dogs were not hurt.

Lieutenant Alisa Keyes, of Seminole County Fire and Rescue, said: 'She
was out walking her dogs. The bear attacked her. She got away and ran 
to a neighbor's house,' Keyes said.

'The bear ran off and they were 
unable to locate him.'

Karen Parker
of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sent biologists to 
the scene to search for paw prints and set a trap, said bears go into 
residential areas in search of easily obtainable food.

'It's fall and the bears are trying to fatten up,' Parker said. 'Our big message is remove attractants from your yard.'

The
wildlife commission receives the most complaints about bears in the 
northeast region of Florida, and the Ocala National Forest in central 
Florida, where most of them live, Parker said.

The first documented bear attack in FWC's history happened in March 2012.

The bear attack victim was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, Florida, 20 miles south of where the incident took place

Terri Gurley, of Seminole County, was bitten by a female bear as she, too, walked her dog one morning.

FWC captured and euthanized the 300lb bear nearly a week after the attack.

On Monday night, FWC officers and Seminole County deputies searched the area where the bear attacked the woman.

'We've got a little blood trail here,' an FWC officer said.

In the past five years, bear complaints more than doubled statewide to 6,189 in 2012, according to a recent analysis of a state wildlife database, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Two of every five calls came from Lake, Volusia, Seminole, Orange or Osceola counties.

Still, despite thousands of nuisance calls, wildlife officers move only a dozen bears a year from Central Florida neighborhoods, usually to Ocala National Forest, and euthanize about a dozen more.

Experts say that relocation fails about half the time as the bears follow their noses and sometimes find their way back. And, often, other bears take their place.

The black bear, Florida's largest native land mammal, was removed from the state's threatened-species list last year. Yet it remains protected in Florida, where it is illegal to purposely injure or kill one. Feeding them also is illegal.
