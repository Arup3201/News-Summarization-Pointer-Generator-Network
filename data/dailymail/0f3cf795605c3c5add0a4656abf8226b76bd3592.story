Sex for violence? Tarek Mehanna, now jailed, may have written a recruitment poem that promised jihadist recruits an afterlife filled with big-bosomed virgins

A poem purportedly penned by a now-imprisoned American-born jihadist has re-emerged and reveals a decidedly sexual slant to radical Islamist propaganda tactics.

According to the New York Post, Pittsburgh-born Tarek Mehanna wrote the sexually charged verses to his friend Ahmad Abousamra, a man now believed to be the ISIS public relations man after he fled the US with the FBI on his tail in 2006.

The poem titled Make Martyrdom What You Seek promises 'the Ultimate Prize' for taking a bullet to the heart: 72 untouched virgins.

'Your bargain with your Lord,' Mehanna supposedly wrote, 'is finally complete.'

If Mehanna is still writing his poetry, it's from a jail cell. 

However, the friend he may have helped inspire to become a major threat to the United States remains at large.

Abousamra was indicted in 2009 after taking multiple trips to Pakistan and Yemen, where he attempted to obtain military training for the purpose of killing American soldiers overseas, the FBI said. 

He also traveled to Iraq in the hope of joining forces fighting against the United States, but the exact nature of his activities there is unknown, the FBI said.

Now, the FBI believes the American-citizen has joined with ISIS to use his computer skills to spread the extremist group's dangerous propaganda.

Propaganda that no doubt makes promises similar to the ones in his old friend Mehanna's poem.

Inspired? Mehanna's poem was reportedly penned for his friend Ahmad Abousamra, who has since fled the US to become the ISIS pr man in Syria

'Make Martyrdom What You Seek' 

The bullets hit your hearts like the stings of a bee

You fall on your face as all you can see,

Are the Gardens so wide when you’re put in the ground

You’ve been searching for years and now you have found,

The Ultimate Prize, so sacred, so sweet

Your bargain with your Lord is finally complete,

Because you are all martyrs without fear or grief

Who gave all you had for your precious belief,

You promised Him your souls and He promised you much more

Now you can enjoy what He’s kept in store,

An endless reward for those who stood by

The covenant they made that towards death they would fly,

While graves burn the sinners and squeeze them so tight

You’re shown your places in the Garden, so spacious and bright,

On the Day when Great Terror shall steal all their words

Your souls will rest in the hearts of green birds,

Under the Great Throne with beauty beyond measure

At you ar-Rahmaan laughs, expressing His Pleasure,

Sufficient is this as a heavenly prize

But prepared for you is that never before seen by the eyes,

On your head is placed a crown, one jewel of which is worth

More than all of the jewels contained in this Earth,

You are brought to a gathering with companions so beautiful

The Prophets, the righteous and those who were truthful,

Al-Firdaws, where those of the Right Hand shall meet

Where the soil is white musk, so smooth and so sweet,

You scoop up a handful and throw it in the air

You are relaxed by the rivers flowing everywhere,

Water, milk and honey gushing forth non-stop

So thick and delicious you want to devour each drop,

You drink so much you almost end up falling

Into the flowing current, then you hear voices calling,

You turn and behold! The voices are singing

Coming from Maidens so fair and enchanting,

These are the Hoorees with round and firm chests

Pure untouched virgins, they’re better than the best,

Seventy-two in all, with large eyes of dark hue

Each one created especially for you,

They call out your name asking where you are

But to their disappointment, from the battles you are far,

Your heart is intoxicated by the pleasures of this life

Fear (of death) has wounded your manhood like a sharp knife,

A knife sharpened by the callers to Hell’s every door

Who pulled the sword from your hand and threw it to the floor,

And given you women, children and money instead

Convincing you ‘this is better than ending up dead,’

But no! They are alive, rejoicing and provided for!

When asked what they desire, they will answer no more!

So be from the cream of this heavenly crop!

Shake off your fear and let your doubts drop!

Pick up the sword and grab your horse’s reins tight!

Throw off your armor and jump into the fight!

Make your path be none other than Islaam’s high peak

Whose mountain is climbled by making death what you seek!
