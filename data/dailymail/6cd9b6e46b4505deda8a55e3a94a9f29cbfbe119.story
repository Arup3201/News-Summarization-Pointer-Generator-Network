Rotting food, no working toilet and feces splattered all over the walls - those were some of the deplorable conditions inside of the Tennessee home of a woman accused of killing her two young children by locking them in the back seat of a car on a hot day in August of 2012, as she went and took a nap, according to a recently released report.

When authorities found the bodies of the two children - 2-year-old Daniel and 3-year-old Savannah Marise - the thermometers used to measure their body temperatures maxed out at 107 degrees.

Additionally, the report states, 25-year-old Samantha Harper knew the car in which she locked the children didn't even work, which has investigators doubting her claim that the children's death was just a tragic accident.

Tragedy: Harper's daughter, Savannah, 3, cooked to death after she was left in the back of a hot car with her brother, Daniel, 2

Harper has since been been charged with two counts each of murder and aggravated child abuse in the August, 2012 deaths of her two children. She awaits a five-day trial expected to take place in February.

The Tennessee Department of Child Services recently released thousands of pages of child death records, including 44 pages about the deaths of the Marise children. The names of children were redacted from the reports, but the Tennessean was able to independently confirm the pages related to the deaths of the Marise children.

The records paint a grisly picture of life for the children in their mother's home, which was later condemned due to its dreadful condition.

'The children did not have beds and the walls in the room had food and 
feces smeared and splattered on them,' records state. 'When the children
were found deceased they were found to have cuts on their hands and 
they were filthy.'

Neglect: Amongst the mounds of filth, authorities found piles of soiled diapers inside the home

Records and photographs of the home taken after the deaths of the two children show mounds of garbage, rotting food, fast food bags, piles of soda cans, used diapers and cigarette burns on the walls and floors. Additionally, investigators discovered that the home had no working toilet. 

But the investigation into the deaths wasn't the first time authorities paid a visit to Harper's house of filth - in both October of 2010 and October of 2011, DCS sent child neglect investigators to the home to follow up on allegations of environmental neglect and lack of supervision after neighbors found the children wandering around outside as Harper was sleeping.

In each case DCS investigators determined that there were 'no services needed.'

On the day of the alleged murders, paramedics rushed to Harper's home after she called 9-1-1 from a neighbors house to report that she found the children unresponsive in the car.

Dropped the ball: CPS officials were called to Harper's home at least twice but took no action in either case

Temperatures outside were about 99 degrees the day the children were locked into their car seats in the back of Harper's inoperable vehicle, and investigators estimate that the temperature inside the car was upwards of 140 degrees.

Initially, Harper told police that she strapped the children into their car seats and then went inside and fell asleep. 

But Harper's story repeatedly changed - after first admitting to putting the kids in the car, Harper later told police 'she does remember putting them in the car.'

Additionally, a relative of Harper's told authorities that the car didn't work and that she 'never drove it.'

The children's father was at work the day they were killed and has not been charged with any crimes.
