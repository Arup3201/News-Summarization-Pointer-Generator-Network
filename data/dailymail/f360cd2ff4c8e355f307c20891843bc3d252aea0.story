A mansion on the site where fabled hero Robin Hood was said to have died has gone on sale for £1.3m.

The 17th century Carr House, located on the Kirklees Estate near the West Yorkshire village of Hartshead, has four bedrooms and is surrounded by 750-acres of land.

The Grade I-listed grand mansion is one of the most historic in Britain and features a 'flying' staircase and an oak room.

Legend has it that the folk figure, who was in the estate's priory dying of old age, fired an arrow from his bed and demanded to be buried where it landed. His grave is in the back garden of the estate but is closed to the public.

Hood's name was first mentioned in the late 13th century and has become a historic outlaw in folklore.

Halifax estate agent Charnock Bates describe the four-bedroom house as offering 'unique and elegant living'.

Dining room: The mansion went through a major renovation in the 1990s under the auspices of English Heritage but has still maintained a number of its historical features

Gardens: The entire 750-acre estate belonged to the Armytage family from 1565 and Lady Margaret Armytage, who died in 2008, was the the last to live in the grounds

The drawing room could provide adequate space for an office or even a library. Cross swords and a stag's head remain as evidence of the estate's history

A separate living room allows residents to relax on leather sofa in front of an old, stone-rimmed fireplace. A bookshelf sits next to a statue in the corner of the room

Study: A desk with a large leather chair sits in front or large bay windows. The no-classical drawing room is scattered with artwork and classic lighting

Latrine: The toilet, attached by the wall to a wooden block, comes with a sink and modern lighting underneath a curved brick ceiling

Washing: The bathroom is smaller than the toilet, but has a tub fit for a aristocrat. A marble busts sits on a stand in the corner of the room

Steps to back door: The folk hero who robbed the rich is thought to have bled to death in the grounds after being betrayed by the Abbess of Kirklees in the 1200s

Nature: The estate, on the outskirts of the West Yorkshire village of Hartshead, is surrounded by large areas of grass and leads onto a river

Protected: The oak wall panels which surround the majority of the rooms in the house are insured for £750,000. Three other historic listed houses on the incredible Kirklees Priory are also for sale and cost between £425,000 and £625,000.

Luxurious: The formal living room has two large windows looking out onto the manicured ground. A library is neatly tucked away in the corner

View: Residents can look out into the Yorkshire countryside from one of the rooms upstairs. An open gate blocks the road which leads to the front of the house

Fable: Legend has it that Hood fired a bow from his bed at the Priory located in the grounds, despite being weakened by old age, and requested to be buried where the arrow landed

Military relics: A coat of arms stands holding an axe is placed next to a fireplace. Many stories surround the legend of Robin Hood, including one theory that he was a member of the aristocracy and dispossessed of all his possessions

Robin Hood as portrayed by Jonas Armstrong in the BBC series

According to most versions of the Robin Hood story, the famous outlaw died after being bled  - a common medical practice during the Middle Ages.

Robin had realised that he was dying and so decides to be bled by his cousin, the prioress of Kirklees. His comrade Will Scarlett is not in favour of this, but nevertheless Robin sets off for the priory, accompanied by Little John having refused to take a bodyguard as recommended by Scarlett. 

In one version of the tale the prioress lets out too much blood, killing him, while in another the hero was stabbed by her lover Sir Roger of Doncaster. In both cases the prioress was seeking revenge for Robin's side of the family inheriting the land and titles.

Other re-tellings leave out the pair's relationship and say the prioress killed Robin so that Maid Marian - who has hidden in the convent and taken orders in the belief that her lover was already dead - will inherit his title and lands, thus allowing the abbey to take on his property.

When he realises he is about to die, Robin calls for Little John using his hunting horn, and although he is too late to save his friend, Little John is able to help Robin fire his last arrow from the window of the gatehouse - bowing to bury Robin wherever the arrow lands.

Little John wants to avenge the death by destroying the nunnery and killing all the nuns, but is prevented from doing so by Robin - who chivalrously reminds his pal that their code has always prevented them from hurting women.

In the film Robin and Marian, it is Maid Marian, now a nun, who poisons Robin and herself when he is seriously wounded in his last battle with the Sheriff of Nottingham and she wants to spare him the agony of never again being the man he once was.
