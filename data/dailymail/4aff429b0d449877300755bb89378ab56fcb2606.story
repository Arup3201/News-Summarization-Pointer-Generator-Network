Revenge: Franklin Davis, pictured, has admitted to killing 16-year-old Shania Gray and was found guilty of capital murder on Tuesday

A Texas father is facing a possible death sentence after he was convicted Tuesday of shooting dead his children's babysitter to prevent her testifying that he raped her.

Franklin Davis, 31, from Dallas, admitted in court to killing 16-year-old Shania Gray, describing how he lured her into his car outside her school, shot her and dumped her body in a river.

But he said he killed her out of revenge and hatred, not to obstruct the sexual assault case that was nearing trial.

The jurors who found Davis guilty of 
capital murder will now decide whether to sentence him to death or life 
imprisonment without parole eligibility.

Testimony in the penalty phase of the trial is scheduled to continue Wednesday.

Gray was remembered after her death as a vivacious, friendly girl who often played basketball in the driveway of her Carrollton home.

Most people did not know she was at the center of the sexual assault case against Davis.

Her mother told police in the Dallas 
suburb of Mesquite that Davis sexually assaulted Gray while she was 
looking after his children.

Davis,
known by the nickname 'Wish,' exposed himself and had sex with the girl
four separate times in 2011, according to a police affidavit.

Davis continued to deny the allegations at his murder trial.

'She lied,' Davis said on the stand, 
according to Dallas television station KTVT. 'She ruined my life. She 
took everything from me, everything I work so hard to get. She took it.'

In
the days before he killed Gray, Davis called and sent her text messages
pretending to be a boy and asking her questions about the sexual 
assault case.Â 

The day of the killing, Gray got a text message saying her new friend was outside her school to surprise her.

Davis' defense attorneys argued that he was trying to do his own investigation after police did not.

But prosecutors scoffed at that notion.

'You know it, I know it and he knows it,' prosecutor Russell Wilson told jurors, according to The Dallas Morning News.

In
December 2012, while awaiting trial, Davis stole a deputy's gun, fled a
Dallas hospital and held police at bay for nearly two hours before 
surrendering peacefully and returning to the medical center, officials said at
the time.

The then-30-year-old surrendered 
shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday December 4 and was returned to Parkland 
Memorial Hospital, the same hospital from which he had escaped about 
8.30 p.m. while receiving treatment, according to Dallas County 
sheriff's spokeswoman Carmen Castro.

Castro said she did not know what kind of treatment Davis was receiving.

Dallas
police tactical squad officers surrounded the Carrollton man about 9 
p.m. after he sought refuge in a van about a mile from the hospital, 
Castro said.

Negotiations finally resolved the standoff peacefully, she said and the deputy was uninjured in the incident at the hospital.

Davis
was in custody awaiting trial in Gray's September death, He had been 
charged with four counts of sexually assaulting Gray when he took Gray 
from her school.

Police 
said Davis confessed to killing the girl, and he did again during his 
trial. Police say he killed her to prevent Gray from testifying against 
him in a sexual assault case, though he said it was purely out of hatred
and revenge.

Family and 
friends had said that when she was killed Gray's family was in the 
process of moving from one Dallas suburb to another so her father could 
be closer to work.

According to relatives and an affidavit released by Carrollton police, Davis posed as a teenage boy on the Facebook social media page and bought a new cell phone to contact Gray and get information about the sexual assault case.

The two exchanged text messages, though Carrollton police spokesman Jon Stovall said he didn't know how many.

Davis told Carrollton police Gray was surprised to see him when he pulled up to her outside her school but got into his car because he wanted to discuss the case.

He told police and several television stations that he drove her to an area near the Trinity River and shot her twice. He then stepped on her neck until she stopped breathing, the affidavit said. Her body was found two days later.
