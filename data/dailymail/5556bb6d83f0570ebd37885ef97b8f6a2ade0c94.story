A Manly hobby photographer has transformed the beachside suburb he calls home into a miniature toy town in a four-minute video.

Dean McQuade, who is originally from Scotland, filmed and edited the video in just three weeks using the tilt-shift function on his camera.

The clip, which is posted on YouTube, depicts a day in Manly - from arriving in a ferry in the morning to leaving at nightfall.

'My initial idea was to film a day of visiting Manly,' McQuade said.

Hobby photographer, Dean McQuade, decided to capture Manly using a tilt and shift technique, which gives it a miniature town look

The technique used blurs the frame and the further away you are from your subject the more miniature everything looks

'You have the ferry arriving and looking over the Manly beaches and then you have a shot of Shelley Beach and then scenes of all around the coastal area.

'And at the end you see the ferry leaving in the evening.'

The video was shot using a Sony NEX 6 - a gift from his girlfriend, Laura Davies.

He said the tilt-shift effect gave the suburb a toy-like look. 

McQuade used a camera his girlfriend gave him for Christmas to film

It took McQuade three weeks to film and edit the video that has attracted almost 1500 views on YouTube

'It blurs out areas of the frame,' McQuade said.

'The more far away you are from your subject, the more miniature scale effect you achieve.'

With the video, McQuade said he wanted to showcase what the suburb had to offer and practice his photography.

The Scottish man wanted to capture the sunny skies and scenic beaches of Manly

The video was meant to depict 'a day in Manly' from when someone arrived by ferry to nightfall

'I’ve always enjoyed photography and mucked around with different cameras, but this is the first serious camera I’ve got,' he said.

'With all the nice weather and the great beaches, there are a lot of subjects to photograph.

'Sydney is a playground for photographers.'

The video has attracted almost 1500 views on YouTube so far since it was posted in February.
