As a little girl, Merryl Tengesdal dreamed of becoming an astronaut.

Although she never got the chance to suit up for NASA, flying at 70,000 feet in the cockpit of a U-2 spy plane, Tengesdal has come closer to the edge of the Earth's atmosphere than most people ever will.

Tengesdal is only one of eight female U- pilots, and she holds the distinction of being the only African-American female pilot in the history of the high-altitude recon aircraft program, which celebrates its 50th anniversary next August.

Trailblazer: Lt. Col. Merryl Tengesdal, 9th Reconnaissance Wing inspector general and U-2 Dragon Lady pilot, in front of a U-2 Feb. 9, 2015, at Beale Air Force Base, California. Tengesdal is the only black female U-2 pilot in history

Recently, the trailblazing Air Force officer has been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

‘I feel like I've made it to the top. Being an astronaut would be the cream. But I've got the whole cake and everything. I'm good,’ Tengesdal tells NBC.

Merryl Tengesdal started her career as a US Navy helicopter pilot before making the transition to the US Air Force in 2004. Over the past decade, she has logged 3,400 flight hours, 330 combat hours and served missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa, according to theUS Department of Defense. 

But one of her most memorable moments at the controls of her U-2 plane, affectionately nicknamed the Dragon Lady, happened stateside.

A couple of years ago, Tengesdal was flying over Los Angeles when she saw a shooting star blazing across the night sky at eye level.

Tengesdal says for kids growing up in the US today, the sky is the limit, and all they have to do is shoot for those stars.

Aspiring astronaut: As a little girl, Tengesdal dreamed of joining NASA. Instead, she became a high-altitude U-2 pilot flying at altitudes of 13 miles above the Earth's surface 

One giant leap for mankind: Tengesdal and her fellow U-2 pilots are required to wear full pressure suits and special helmets – not unlike NASA astronauts’ gear - and are allowed to fly only once every three days

‘Think of how far you can go, because you can reach those. Because in America, we can pretty much do anything,’ she says.

Tengesdal knows first-hand how difficult it can be to rise about one's humble circumstances.

The pioneering Air Force pilot grew up in a drug-ridden part of The Bronx, but she was fortunate enough to have a strong support system, including her mother and teachers, who steered her clear of trouble. 

In school, Tengesdal excelled in math and was obsessed with Star Trek.

In 1994, she graduated from the University of New Heaven with a degree in engineering and then enrolled in the Navy's Officer Candidate School, followed by a stint at flight training.

Her first aircraft was Navy's Seahawk helicopter, but Tengesdal yearned to fly higher and challenge herself, and so she joined an elite force of less than 1,000 U-2 pilots after undergoing a rigorous nine-month training program.

Career switch: Tengesdal got her start in 1994 as a US Navy helicopter pilot. A decade later, she transitioned to the Air Force, joining the elite U-2 program  

Soaring at altitudes of about 13 miles above the Earth's surface, Tengesdal and her fellow U-2 pilots are required to wear full pressure suits and special helmets – not unlike NASA astronauts’ gear - and are allowed to fly only once every three days.

‘It is very uncommon, even for this day and age, to be a female pilot, much less a female minority,’ Tengesdal says. ‘My career field is very male dominated, but I hope I have helped other females with similar aspirations to realize this is an option. I think we are all limitless as to what we can accomplish.’
