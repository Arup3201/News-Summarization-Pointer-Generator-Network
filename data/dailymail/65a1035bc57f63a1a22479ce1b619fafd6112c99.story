Arrested: Saralyn Gayle Portwood in her booking shot after being in by Colin Country Sheriff's Office for allegedly having an affair with a 17-year-old male student

A Texas special education teacher has been arrested for having an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old student.

Married mother of one, Saralyn Gayle Portwood, 30, was taken into custody by officers from the Colin County Sheriff's Office on Thursday and then released that day on $10,000 bond.

Portwood, who also works as the assistant softball coach at Princeton High School was immediately suspended from her job pending an investigation according to the school's district superintendent, Philip Anthony.

Portwood has been teaching at Princeton for less than a year and the 17-year-old boy involved in the allegations is not part of her special education classes.

Anthony said that the arrest happened after the district was tipped off to a possible relationship and went straight to the authorities.

'We’ve turned it all over to Collin County to run their investigation,' said Anthony according to Dallas News.

The district sent a letter a letter home to parents alerting them of the case.

A Collin County sheriff’s spokesman said he didn’t have any comment regarding the case.

Portwood appears to be a religious person, judging by her Facebook page, which shows she is a member of Campus for Christ - a Christian group which has its annual meet in July.

The 30-year-old also posts quotes from Oswald Chambers, an early twentieth-century Scottish Baptist and evangelist, whose classic piece of literature is My Utmost for His Highest.

A proud mother, Portwood also uploads pictures of her husband and son onto social media, commenting that nothing makes her happier than seeing them both together.

The CrossFit enthusiast married her husband John in June last year and requested guests buy wedding gifts from Target.

The attractive mother had been teaching High School Life Skills at Princeton for less than a year before her arrest.
