West Ham are contemplating a move for Monaco striker Lacina Traore as fears grow over Andy Carroll's fitness.

The England striker has sustained an ankle injury on the club's tour of New Zealand causing him to miss Wednesday morning's 2-1 defeat to Wellington.

And manager Sam Allardyce is giving serious consideration to signing another centre forward amid concerns over his £15million man.

Traore is among the names on West Ham's potential shortlist ahead of the new season.

The 6ft 8in striker nearly joined the Hammers in January, but the Ivory Coast star opted to join Everton on loan instead.

He scored on his debut for the Toffees against Swansea in the FA Cup on February 16, but sustained a hamstring injury six days later in the warm-up ahead of a clash with Chelsea and missed the rest of the season.

Monaco are willing to let the striker, who could also be a target for Everton, leave this summer - a development West Ham are aware of.

Star signing: He might have cost West Ham £15million but Carroll's injury problems make him unreliable

Carroll's time at Upton Park has been beset by injury problems, and his latest set-back has led to fears over his long-term fitness ahead of the new season.

He made just 16 appearances for the club last season owing to a serious heel injury.

West Ham insist he is not expected to miss the start of the new campaign, but Allardyce knows he can ill-afford another year without a proven centre forward to lead his attack.

Carroll's injury problems, and his lack of options up front, played a key factor in the club's disappointing 2013/14 campaign - with the Hammers even playing without a recognised centre-forward for some matches.

But Allardyce, who has completed deals for forwards Mauro Zarate and Enner Valencia, does not want to fall into the same trap next season and is weighing up a move for a new hitman.
