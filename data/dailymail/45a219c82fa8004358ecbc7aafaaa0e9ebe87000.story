Comic-mad couple Dean Williamson and Lorna Foley made their dreams come true at a wacky wedding with a twist.

Groom Dean had no excuse for being late as he got to the wedding venue in Liverpool's historic St George's Hall in a DeLorean DMC 12, which was the model used by Michael J Fox in Back To The Future.

Then it was back to the reception for a wedding breakfast featuring a Gotham City-themed cake, complete with its own Scalextric racing track and a mini Batmobile.

Lorna, with the help of her bridesmaids, even made a bouquet and corsages from cut up Batman comics

The pair then entertained their guests racing round the track as Batman and the Joker.

Lorna, with the help of her bridesdmaids, even made her floral bouquet and corsages from intricately cut up and folded Batman comics.

Lorna, a 33-year-old children's entertainer, said: 'We feel so lucky with how everything came together and it was a mega fun day.

Lorna, a 33-year-old children's entertainer, loved their theme: 'It was a mega fun day'

The wedding cake was Gotham City-themed, complete with a mini Batmobile and working tiny race track

Lorna insists that the theme was 'a bit of a mish-mash' and that's exactly how the couple wanted it 

'The theme was a bit of a mish-mash and that was the plan...sort of!

'Dean and I opened the cabaret with a comedy western sketch to the music from 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' where he was a sheriff looking for me as a wanted bandit. 

'I made my escape on my green walking circus globe.

The intricate cake was the reception's centrepiece and the couple raced their guests around the cake track

Lorna's headpiece was as stunning as her bouquet - and even had tiny clocks incorporated into the design

Sealed with a kiss! The couple posed on either side of the iconic vehicle for a wedding shot to remember

'We had a group of talented friends from the cabaret scene in Liverpool perform at our evening cabaret - we're so grateful to them for their performances.'

Dean, 38, who works for an events company, said: 'Everyone on the buses going past the hall was looking at us in the DeLorean.

'It was an amazing day, just fantastic.'
