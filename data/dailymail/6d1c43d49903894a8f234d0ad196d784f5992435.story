A food company has been forced to call its meatballs simply 'balls' - because they don't contain enough 'proper' meat.

Finnish food giant Kesko changed the name on its website after authorities insisted its meatballs did not meet regulations because they are made from mechanically separated meat (MSM).

MSM is taken from the bone after the desired meat cuts are removed. It can be referred to as 'white slime'.

A spokesman for Kesko said: 'The balls have the equivalent of 52 per cent meat.

'However, according to current legislation, they aren't from parts of the animal that can be described as meat.' 

The company added that it was not misleading customers because the type of meat it uses is 'well-suited' to ground meat products, YLE reported. 

The other 48 per cent of Kesko's 'balls' are made from wheat flour, potato flour and soya protein, as well as rapeseed oil, salt and other additives. 

A spokesman for Kesko said the meat it uses is mechanically separated from the bone after the desired meat cuts are removed. Scrap pork is also used. Above, a stock photo of cooked meatballs

Matti Kalervo, vice-president of corporate relations for Kesko, told The Times the company sells meatballs with more meat in, but they are more expensive.

He said: 'This is a price-factor product. It was meant to be a very reasonable price.' 

The use of MSM was banned in the UK in 2012. It was used widely in beef burgers and ready meals.

At the time the British Meat Processors Association described it as a 'criminal waste of a valuable product'.
