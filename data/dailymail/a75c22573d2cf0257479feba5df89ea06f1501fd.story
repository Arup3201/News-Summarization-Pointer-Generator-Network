Dozens of demonstrators today stormed  restaurants and targeted white diners in New York and California as part of a 'Black Brunch' protest against alleged police violence.

Carrying banners, the chanting protesters entered a number of venues in New York City that they identified as 'white spaces', including midtown eateries: Lallisse, Maialino and Pershing Square.

Once inside, they 'disrupted' customers' meals by reading out the names of African-Americans killed by police, including Michael Brown, 17, who was shot dead by officer Darren Wilson last August.

Addressing staff and patrons, they shouted: 'Every 28 hours, a black person in America is killed by the police. These are our brothers and sisters. Today and every day, we honor their lives.'

This afternoon, the hashtag #BlackBrunch was trending in the U.S..

Although the demonstration has been largely peaceful - with no arrests made - there have been several reports of protesters getting into heated discussion with staff and customers.

And while many have applauded the nonviolent tactic online, other social media users have mocked it and some have even criticized it as 'pathetic' and 'ridiculous'.

The protest comes just months after police killings of unarmed teenager Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and 43-year-old father Eric Garner on Staten Island sparked nationwide demonstrations.

The rage of demonstrators was then further ignited in November when two grand juries chose not to indict the officers responsible for Brown and Garner's deaths - Wilson and officer Daniel Pantaleo.

On December 20 last year, gunman Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, 28, shot dead two officers in the line of duty in Brooklyn, New York, before committing suicide at a nearby subway station.

Earlier in the day, Brinsley had posted a photo of a gun on Instagram, with the caption: 'I'm putting wings on pigs today. They Take 1 Of Ours... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice #RIPErivGardner #RIPMikeBrown… This May Be My Final Post. I'm Putting Pigs In A Blanket.'

This morning, tens of thousands of officers from across teh country lined the streets of Brooklyn for the funeral of one of the two deceased cops - Wenjian Liu - who emigrated from China aged 12.
