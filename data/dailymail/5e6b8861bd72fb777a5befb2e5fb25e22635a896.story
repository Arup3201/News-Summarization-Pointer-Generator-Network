A plunging neckline closing three inches below a woman's cleavage is the new super-low-cut trend being worn by the the biggest names on the red carpet.

At one time, a pair of silicone breasts were the ultimate accessory when it came to pulling off the look - just look to Katie Price and Pamela Anderson for proof.

But fast forward a few years and it seems the silicone trend is officially out.

The likes of (L-R) Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence and Sienna Miller have all been embracing a more natural silhouette on the red carpet, proving that the pert silicone breasts of yesteryear are out of fashion

The resounding theme of the night might have been ‘pale and interesting,’ but that notion couldn’t have been any further from the truth in Kate Hudson’s case since she left our eyeballs popping out of our heads.

The Hollywood screen siren flaunted her all natural, gym-honed physique in a white plunging gown featuring diamante side cut outs and a halter neck design by Versace.

Reminiscent of that Liz Hurley safety pin dress all those years ago with its flesh flashing cut and hourglass silhouette; Kate exudes Hollywood sex appeal with a fashionista edge. She was hands down the sexiest female of the 2015 Golden Globes.

Donatella Versace is the master of crafting gowns that bare a great deal of skin whilst eschewing a tacky aesthetic; With Kate’s sleek updo, natural make-up and limited accessories, she absolutely nails it with her refined demeanor.

And we can learn a lesson or two from Kate's gown because a white maxi will never go out of style. So take your pick from the fashion edit below to emulate Miss Hudson's winning look.

The likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, who was rumoured - but never confirmed - to have had a small enhancement from an AA to a B back in 2010, and Sienna Miller have been championing a more natural silhouette as they take to the red carpet in their daring dresses - and clinical stats back it up.

Transform Cosmetic Group has seen a trend in people requesting more modest implants over the last five years, with the most requested cup size now being a C.

Speaking about the trend for going silicone-free, Mark Norfolk, Clinical Director at Transform, said: 'We’ve seen a real trend in people requesting more natural looks when opting for cosmetic surgery and non-surgical procedures.

'Over the last four-five years, requests have evolved significantly. For instance, we are seeing an increasing number of women opting for more modest breast implants. 

'In fact, over the last year, we’ve found that a third of patients are asking for a full cup C and the most requested cup sizes currently, are a C or D and not the larger implants that we’ve seen in the past.

Indeed, Victoria Beckham admitted in 2014 that she underwent breast augmentation after giving birth to her first son, Brooklyn, in 1999. She then made the decision to reverse the treatment taking her from artificial 34DDs to 34Bs. 

'I don't have them anymore,' she told Allure magazine in 2014, after reportedly seeing an old photo of herself with a fuller chest.

'I think I may have purchased them. Or they got removed, one or the other.'

When asked if they had been removed, the mother-of-four replied: 'Yeah'.

In December 2014, Katie reduced her cup size by five, taking her down to a C

Plastic surgeon superfan Heidi Montag also underwent a reduction in 2013. The Hills star went under the knife in Los Angeles to get her F-Cup breasts reduced down to a size C. 

And it seems the stars are influencing the British public.

Mark added: 'Celebrities have a huge influence on ladies' fashion and beauty choices and they are certainly influencing this trend. With the likes and popularity of Victoria Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge, who both have a more natural look, it seems that the women of the UK are following suit and going for a more sophisticated kind of beauty.'

Dr Patrick Mallucci from the Cadogan Clinic agrees and thinks the natural look is 'long overdue'.

He said: 'There is a definite change in the emphasis on "look" in breast augmentation. Natural breast enlargement is the new buzz word. All of the research I have done on breast beauty indicates that the natural breast is universally preferred by both men, women and across cultures.

'It is changing the way in which women are approaching the issue of breast augmentation and how we are encouraging surgeons to approach the way they deliver their surgery. It is a healthy change which is long overdue.'
