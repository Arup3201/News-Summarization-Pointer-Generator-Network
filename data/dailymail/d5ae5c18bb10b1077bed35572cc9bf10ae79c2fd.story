Locals in Praia da Luz have vented their anger at Scotland Yard’s re-investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann by spraying road signs in the resort with graffiti.

The words ‘McCann circus’ have been stenciled onto dozens of Stop signs in the Portuguese resort where Madeleine disappeared in May 2007, so they read 'Stop McCann Circus'.

Four arguidos - or 'persons of interest' - were quizzed in Portugal last Tuesday as part of the latest stage of the Metropolitan Police’s multi-million-pound probe.

One resident told the Daily Mirror: ‘We know these people, they are innocent. It is crazy. When will it end? We want to be left alone.'

The mayor, Victor Mata, has expressed concern at the timing of the searches, as he fears it’ll put tourists off visiting.

He said: ‘The next three months are when the entire village earns its keep.'

In June, Portuguese and British police searched three sites in Praia da Luz for clues but found no evidence relating to the case.

A former Scotland Yard commander, meanwhile, has urged British police to search an abandoned well just 875 yards from the apartment where Madeleine vanished.

The Mail on Sunday has established that the uncovered shaft is on scrubland used as a campsite by Roma gipsies – and has been overlooked by Portuguese police.

Hidden from the nearby road, the well drops 30ft down to 12ft-deep water.

‘It is clearly known to locals and possibly to local criminals as a place to discard evidence from petty crime, such as handbags and other unwanted stolen items,’ said Roy Ramm, who served 27 years with the Metropolitan Police force and, as Commander of Specialist Operations, dealt with serious crime, from murder to rape and human trafficking.

He added: ‘Whoever abducted Madeleine knew the local streets, alleyways and scrubland and used that knowledge to avoid detection.’
