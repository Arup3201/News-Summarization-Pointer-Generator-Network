Sometimes when it feels like life couldn't get any worse, it's best to do as mice do and cuddle. 

These adorable dormice from Russia managed to put on more than a brave face after their nest was destroyed by loggers ... and climbed a dried reed and  laughed their misfortune away.

They lost their home last week when workmen arrived to clear an area of forest near Trutnov, in eastern Russia.

Fortunately, Czech photographer and animal love, Miroslav Hlávko, came to their rescue and called a local wildlife rescue worker to make sure they were both taken care of. But not before taking these heart-warming photographs.

The 34-year-old managed to get close enough to capture the tender moment on camera by slowly approaching the pair from a distance.

Miroslav said: 'Some loggers had recently cut down a tree with the little dormice still inside their nests.

'Luckily, they didn't suffer any injuries, I think maybe that is why they are both smiling.

'I managed to get really close to them by making my way very slowly through the grass and after looking back at the photograph, they seemed glad to see me.

'As soon as I took the image I knew it would be popular, they just look so comfortable and happy.

'It was so cute to see them cuddling together, they soon settled down and actually one of the mice started yawning. 

'This might be one of my favourite photographs I have ever taken, it wasn't easy to taking a photo in the forest but I think I captured the moment just right.'
