Rebecca Grant, the Los Angeles Clippers fan who became a viral sensation when she was caught on camera during a game adjusting her hair and grabbing her breasts, says she is now inundated with promotional offers. 

The 45-year-old told Fox411 on Friday she's received 'a lot of anti-aging skin care campaigns/fitness offers, after my age was published everywhere, and fans are in disbelief.'

Caught unaware: Speaking to Fox411, Grant maintained that she did not realize the camera was on her at the Clippers game last week as she fixed her hair and adjusted her breasts

'A lady doesn't like to talk about age, but we live in a time that age and everything else about a person is available online,' she told the station. 'If I book an anti-aging campaign or fitness campaign, it would at least be a little more worth everyone continuing to talk about my age.'

Speaking on-camera to Fox411 on Wednesday, Grant said she wanted to be known for more than her suggestive poses.

'I really don't want to be known as the boob grabber,' she said.

Having a laugh: Grant wrote 'LMFAO! This is honestly the funniest thing I have ever seen! Every single person is animated. Had no idea I was on'

Grant denied on Twitter that she knew she was being filmed as she adjusted herself during the Clippers game against the Golden State Warriors last week.

'LMFAO,' the hostess tweeted on Sunday. 'This is honestly the funniest thing I have ever seen! Every single person is animated. Had no idea I was on.'

Grant 
maintained her innocence during her Wednesday interview, and said she 
was just trying to adjust her hair and prevent a 'wardrobe malfunction' 
when she was caught on camera.

Grant also seemed unaware of the camera when she made remarks to an off-camera man named 'Rob' during her live interview with Diana Falzone.

'[...]The thing that I'm mostly excited about is the Clippers. Taking anything off this distraction and just like, being a team favorite - hang on. Rob, stop it. I'm sorry. This isn't live,' she said.

Grant said 'What? I already said that. Stop it, go away,' in response to Rob's remarks, which aren't audible.

Grant said on Wednesday she has seats for Friday's game approximately four down from the ones that made her famous.

On Thursday, however, Grant tweeted she will have her trademark seats back for Sunday's game.

'LOL
 Just got the same EXACT seats for @LAClippers game on Sunday!!,' she 
tweeted. 'I'll be sure to wave, and keep my hands to my side 
#ClipperNation.'

Queen of the team: on May 4 Grant tweeted 'Thanks #ClipperNation for naming me #QueenOfLAClippers'
