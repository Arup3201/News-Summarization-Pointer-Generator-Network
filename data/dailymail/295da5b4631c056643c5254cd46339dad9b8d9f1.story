New French president Francois Hollande launched an outspoken attack last night on Britain’s obsession with protecting the City of London from Brussels-inspired legislation.

As David Cameron warned that the single currency is in ‘extreme trouble’, the socialist victor suggested that Britain is ‘indifferent to the fate of the euro area’ and ‘attentive only to the interests of the City’.

This is despite the fact that billions of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money is already being used to prop up the basket-case currency.

Mr Hollande, who campaigned against austerity measures designed to save the euro, went on to threaten the UK with new Europe-wide taxes to neuter the City of London.

He signalled his support for an EU-wide transaction tax on financial deals and a fresh push for tax harmonisation – both of which are fiercely opposed by the British government.

The combination of Mr Hollande’s socialist demands for an end to austerity across Europe with political and economic turmoil in Greece pitched the continent back into crisis yesterday.

Panic selling sent shares and the euro into free fall in early trade before losses were clawed back in a late rally on a rollercoaster day across Europe.

The euro fell to a three-and-a-half year low of 80.44p against the pound and a three-month low of $1.2955 against the dollar before recovering.

Shares around Europe were hammered in early trading before bouncing back as investors digested the news from Paris and Athens.

On a dramatic day across the 
eurozone, the Greek stock market plunged nearly seven per cent. But shares 
in Germany made small gains while France closed up nearly 2 per cent and
 Italy and Spain were more than 2.5 per cent higher.

Experts raised the prospect that 
Greece will fall out of the euro after 60 per cent of voters there 
backed parties opposed to austerity measures which have been demanded in
 exchange for massive bailouts by the international community.

To make matters worse, Mr Hollande placed himself on a collision course with both Britain and Germany.

Following his victory over Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday night, he boldly announced: ‘Austerity can no longer be inevitable!’

Difference of opinion: Mr Cameron will make plain his frustration with the chaos in Europe today, as Angela Merkel, right, continues to insist that austerity measures must stay in place

But yesterday German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear that her government will not renegotiate the terms of the eurozone’s deal to save the single currency – which calls for austerity measures in exchange for bailout cash.

‘From our point of view, a new negotiation of the fiscal compact is not possible,’ said Mrs Merkel’s spokesman. Her parliamentary party leader Volker Kauder added: ‘Germany is not here to finance French election promises.’

Mr Hollande will make his first 
foreign visit as president to Berlin. But he will not see Mr Cameron 
until the end of next week at the G8 summit at Camp David. It is likely 
to be a tense affair.

In an interview with the French-language version of the Slate website, he condemned Britain’s approach to the euro crisis.

Mr
 Hollande made clear he resents Britain remaining outside the single 
currency because the Bank of England – unlike the European Central Bank –
 has been able to print money to keep the economy afloat.

He
 said: ‘In addition to relative indifference to the fate of the euro 
area, Britain is more protected because of speculation the central bank 
may intervene directly to finance the debt.’

‘Europe is not a
 cash box, let alone a cashpoint.’ Mr Hollande then went further by 
making clear that he would fight Britain over new EU taxes.

‘The British have been particularly shy about the issues of financial regulation, and attentive only to the interests of the City – hence their reluctance to see the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and tax harmonisation in Europe.’

The French president also made clear 
he is at odds with Mr Cameron over austerity. While the PM will insist 
in a speech later today that the UK sticks to the same economic course, 
Mr Hollande is demanding more
 borrowing to stimulate the economy.

‘Everyone admits that austerity alone cannot return balance to the public accounts,’ he said. Mr Hollande offered just one olive branch, saying he would meet Mr Cameron for talks on defence and industrial co-operation.

‘I
 will meet David Cameron soon to discuss the benefits of further 
co-operation between our two countries on the industrial plan. We are 
committed to continued defence rapprochement.’

Asked
 whether he speaks English, he replied: ‘Yes, but I am attached to the 
French language. I will defend the ubiquitous use of French.’

The charge that the government is 
‘indifferent to the fate of the euro’ comes despite Mr Cameron and 
Chancellor George Osborne repeatedly saying that a stable euro is good 
for Britain, not least because 40 per cent of Britain’s exports are to 
the euro area.

What is 
more, Britain has poured more than £12billion into bailouts for bankrupt
 euro nations such as Ireland and Portugal, and £40billion in loans to 
the International Monetary Fund to help pay for Greece’s bailouts.

Despite
 Mr Hollande’s ebullient tone, the greatest crisis last night was 
affecting Greece, where extremist parties are on the brink of power 
after mainstream parties who back the terms of the current bailouts 
failed to form a government.

The Prime Minister will use a speech alongside Nick Clegg to point out that the chaos afflicting the single currency is dragging Britain’s economy down as well.

‘I know that the task of driving our economy forward when faced with the headwinds that are blowing in from the eurozone is a formidable one,’ he will say.

Amid heightened tensions within the coalition following last week's drubbing in the local elections, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will declare their determination to work together and do 'whatever needs doing to succeed'.

The so-called renewal of their 'marriage vows' marks the start of a crucial week for the Government, with the announcement tomorrow in the Queen's Speech of the legislative programme for the new parliamentary session.

In contrast to their initial appearance together two years ago in the Downing Street rose garden, Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg will set out their renewed commitment to work together against the more prosaic backdrop of a factory in Essex.

The tone too will be altogether more sombre, with the Prime Minister warning that the damage done in the financial crash of 2008 was 'greater than anyone thought', while Mr Clegg will liken it to a 'giant heart attack'.

Mr Cameron will stress that their 'number-one priority' was still to keep Britain safe from the financial storm raging in the eurozone and to rescue the economy from the 'mess' left by the last Labour government.

'That was and remains our guiding task and in these perilous times it's more important than ever for Britain that we stick to it,' he is expected to say.

Still together: Prime Minister David Cameron, right, and Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, will renew their 'marriage vows' two years after their first speech together in the Downing Street rose gardens in 2010

'I don't hide from the scale of that challenge - or from the message sent by voters in many places in last week's elections. I'm listening. I'm leading. I get it. There are no closed minds, no closed doors in Downing Street.

'I know that the task of getting driving our economy forward when faced with the headwinds that are blowing in from the eurozone is a formidable one.

'But this Government is determined to do whatever needs doing to succeed.'

In his remarks, Mr Clegg will dismiss claims the coalition has an 'ideological obsession' with shrinking the size of the state, arguing there was a 'clear moral responsibility' to deal with the deficit and not leave it to future generations.

'Ducking the tough choices would only prolong the pain, condemning the next generation to decades of higher interest rates, poorer public services and fewer jobs,' he is expected to say.

'We are taking the tough choices not because we want to, but because we have to - any government would have to do the same.'

At the same time he will emphasise the need to restore economic growth, calling for more to be done to get credit flowing to business and to lever private sector investment into major infrastructure projects.

'Two years in and building the new economy remains the coalition's biggest challenge and while the deficit is part of that - it is only a means to an end,' he will say.

'This Government is galvanised around growth. We owe it to the next generation to get it right.'
