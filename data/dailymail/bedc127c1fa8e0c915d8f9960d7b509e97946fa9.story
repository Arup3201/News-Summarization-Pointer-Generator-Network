A 14-year-old high school football star has killed himself after reportedly getting in trouble for throwing a party.

Reagan Beene, a ninth grade student at Cambridge High School in Milton, Georgia, committed suicide on Saturday. Messages on social media suggested he shot himself before his older sister found his body, but authorities have not yet confirmed this.

Other friends suggested that Beene, who lived with his family in Alpharetta, committed suicide after throwing a party, the Hinterland Gazette reported.

Cambridge High School principal Dr Edward Spurka confirmed the death in a statement.

'It is with great sadness that I send this
 message to our community,' he wrote. 'Today, Cambridge High School mourns the loss
 of one of our beloved 9th graders, Reagan Beene.

'We express our 
deepest sympathy to the Beene family; our thoughts and prayers are with 
them in this time of grief.'

Dr Spurka added that counseling staff would be available at the school on Monday for students.

A memorial is also being held at Stonecreek church, where staff will be available, on Tuesday.

Fellow students have taken to social media to express their grief, agreeing to wear blue as a tribute to Beene at school on Monday. Others scrawled '15' - his jersey number - on their arms.
