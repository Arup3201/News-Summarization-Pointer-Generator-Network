Considering the weight of opposition building up against them over the Ched Evans controversy, taking on the 11 men of Walsall must have felt like an altogether more even contest for Sheffield United.

As the issue escalated dramatically on Wednesday, those taking a stand against the decision to allow the convicted rapist to train with his old club included the Deputy Prime Minister, a local MP, a Sky Sports News presenter, a 1960s pop star and two club sponsors, not to mention 157,000 people who have signed a petition.

Against this rather toxic backdrop, Nigel Clough and his team had to play a Johnstone’s Paint Trophy Northern Area quarter-final against Walsall at the Banks’s Stadium. They lost it 1-0.

'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days, you are also taking on a role model,' Clegg told LBC Radio.

'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime.

'It is for the football club to decide, but I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people.

'I'm sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of Sheffield United.'

Clough maintains that a permanent return for Evans is ‘nowhere near being decided’, but there will surely come a point when the club have to assess if it is really worth the trouble.

After the match, the manager was asked if there is a danger of the club’s reputation being damaged. ‘You’ll have to speak to the owners about that,’ said Clough. ‘It’s their sphere of influence rather than us trying to win football matches. Nothing’s changed.’

For a few hours at least, football was back on the agenda with 500 Blades fans making the trip to the Midlands. There was no repeat of the pro-Evans chants that have been heard since his release from prison last month. After another day of moral debate, it was back to business.

The Sheffield United players are expected in for a warm-down on Thursday. Although Evans has not trained with the first-team squad yet, it is understood that he has already done some light exercise at his old club as he tries to regain fitness after serving half of his five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a Rhyl hotel room.

One dressing-room source said that the players are open-minded about the possibility of Evans rejoining the club who paid him £20,000-a-week before his incarceration in April 2012.

That is not a mood shared by an increasingly vocal opposition to the idea of such a move. 

Charlie Webster has decided to resign from her role as patron of Sheffield United after Evans' return

While the Professional Footballers’ Association, who first approached Sheffield United about allowing Evans to train with them, and the club itself have acknowledged the 25-year-old’s right to rehabilitation after serving his punishment, those set against it are concerned by the former Wales striker’s apparent lack of remorse.

Evans has apologised to his girlfriend Natasha Massey for being unfaithful but has always maintained that he is innocent of rape. His application to appeal is expected to be heard by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the next three months.

Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister and Sheffield Hallam MP, urged the League One club to ‘think long and hard’ about taking him back.

Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central and a club shareholder, went a step further by writing an open letter to Sheffield United’s co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps.

He wrote: ‘The way this issue has been handled by the club is dragging our name through the mud and dividing fans. I really hope that you will reflect further and change your mind.’

That followed Sky Sports News presenter Charlie Webster becoming the first of three club patrons to resign over the issue.

Webster, who has previously revealed that she was sexually abused as a teenager, said: ‘I don't believe it is morally right for a convicted rapist, who has still shown no remorse, to go and train with the club because it is trivialising rape.

‘I feel really uneasy that a convicted rapist will be possibly be cheered on by the next generation, by young men that at that moment in time, are still making decisions on how to treat women and what sexual consent is.’

Another Sheffield United patron, 60s singer Dave Berry, stood down because he ‘needed to take a moral stand’, and school food health expert Lindsay Graham followed suit citing personal reasons.

Meanwhile two of the club’s main sponsors, John Holland Sales Ltd and DBL Logistics, also warned that they would re-evaluate their deals if Evans is re-signed.

As he builds towards a possible comeback, the storm gathering around him is showing no signs of going away.
