Hiccups: Mee, 22, found fame in 2007 as a teen because of her uncontrollable hiccupping

Mee, 22, lured Wall-Mart 
worker Shannon Griffin to an abandoned home under the pretense of 
selling him marijuana in October of 2010. Once there, two of Mee's 
friends robbed him at gunpoint - but the victim struggled and was shot 
four times.

Mee, who 
found international fame in 2007 after developing a case of hiccups that
 lasted for five straight weeks, was charged with first-degree murder despite not pulling the trigger. She denies the charge.

Under
 Florida law, someone who participates in a robbery that leads to a 
death can still be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility 
of parole.

Earlier this week, the court heard a recording of the phone conversation she had with her mother hours after her arrest.

'I didn't kill nobody,' Mee said. '…I 
set everything up. It all went wrong, Mom. It [expletive] just went 
downhill after everything happened, Mom.'

On Wednesday, Mee's attorney told the 
court her client was a schizophrenic. The judge then ordered Mee to 
undergo psychological evaluation. It was later determined Mee is 
competent to stand trial.

Assistant State Attorney Christopher LaBruzzo admitted Mee wasn't the one who aimed the gun at Shannon Griffin in his opening address, but he said she was still guilty of first-degree murder because 'she set everything up.'

He told the jury the then-19-year-old used a social networking site through a cell phone to contact Griffin and offer to sell him marijuana but it was all a con.

'There was, in fact, no marijuana to be sold. In fact, instead of marijuana they had a loaded .38-special handgun with six shots in it,' LaBruzzo said, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

He explained that the two men she lived with robbed the 22-year-old Griffin before they struggled over the gun and 'shot him... four times in the chest and they left him for death in a dark alleyway.'

The victim's wallet, keys were later found at Mee's apartment and her fingerprints were discovered on Griffin's driver's license, LaBruzzo said.

Mee's lawyer, John Trevena, used his opening statements to claim that Mee wasn't even at the home when Griffin was fatally shot.

'She is not at that scene but they want you to convict her of murder in the first-degree based on their theory that Ms Mee was setting up a marijuana deal that somehow went bad,' he told the jurors.

Trevena suggested Mee couldn't have been behind the disturbing plot because she didn't even own a cell phone, and therefore couldn't have planned the drug deal with the young man.

Also on Wednesday, Kurt Bradshaw, an officer with the St. Petersburg Police Department, showed the jury a photograph of the crime scene. A handgun and a pair of shoes can be seen on a sidewalk near a white fence.

The jury was selected on Tuesday in the murder trial of the woman who appeared on several national television programs as a teen because of her out-of-control hiccuping.

Judge Nancy Moate Ley told potential jurors in a Pinellas County courtroom that the trial would probably wrap up by the end of the week.

Miss Mee is one of three people accused in the 2010 killing of Walmart employee Shannon Griffin Jr during a burglary gone awry in St. Petersburg.

Relapse: Mee's lawyer said she has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine

Judge Moate Ley said in court Tuesday 
that the prosecution and defense will have to choose a dozen jurors from
 a pool of about 70, The Tampa Tribune reported. Two prospective members of the panel were excused 
after explaining that they would not be able to be impartial.

Two
 other would-be jurors were also dismissed: one of them because Judge 
Moate Ley had presided over her husband's divorce case, and the other 
because she had to take care of her ailing mother. 

The
 case has attracted widespread attention because Mee had gained 
notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop.

Videos
 of her hiccuping up to 50 times a minute gained her national attention,
 as did her attempts to quell the problem. She tried home remedies and 
consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist and an acupuncturist, until 
the hiccups finally stopped on their own.

Just over two weeks ago, Mee's 
co-defendant Laron Raiford, 23, was sentenced to life in prison after 
being convicted of first-degree murder.

Mr Raiford was the first of the three suspects to go to trial. If convicted of murder, Mee could face a life sentence.

At
 issue is whether Mee was a bystander or the person who planned the 
robbery — prosecutors say she played an active role in planning the 
robbery, which lead to Griffin's death.

Under
 Florida law, a person can be convicted of murder if he or she committed
 a serious felony crime — such as robbery — and someone was killed as a 
result.

Trevena, 
Mee's attorney, said his client suffered from Tourette's Syndrome, a 
neurological disorder that can cause involuntary movements and speech 
problems.

Co-defendants: Mee's then-boyfriend Lamont Newton, right, is still awaiting trial, while his friend Laron Raiford, left, was sentenced to life in prison August 30

He said that the hiccups were one symptom of Tourette's and said Tuesday that he will mention that during the trial.

'It
 won't be used as a direct cause for what occurred but it might help 
explain her errors in judgment and her often thoughtless response to law
 enforcement,' said Trevena, who said Mee did not participate in 
the robbery.

Trevena said Mee has been in jail pending trial since her October 2010 arrest — much of that time in isolation because detention deputies say she is a high profile inmate.

Mee has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, said Trevena, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine.

'It controls the hiccups,' he said.

During a tearful prison interview on 
the Today show in 2011, then-19-year-old Mee blamed her short-lived fame
 for taking her down 'the path of the devil' and drawing her into bad 
company.

When
 Mee was 15 years old, she became known as 'hiccup girl' when she began 
hiccuping 50 times a minute. Her condition left doctors baffled and 
earned her international publicity.

Three
 years later, she appeared in the news again - this time charged with 
first-degree felony murder after police claimed she acted as bait to 
lure Shannon Griffin, 22, into a robbery.

Mee
 is not accused of firing the gun, but under Florida law a defendant can
 be charged with murder if they willingly take part in a felony which 
then leads to someone's death.

She has been held in Pinellas County jail ever since she was charged.
 Talking from the prison, she told NBC's Amy Robach in 2011 she cannot bear to 
think about the possibility she could spend the rest of her life behind 
bars.

Downward spiral: Mee is accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old victim to an empty house where he was robbed and killed

She said: 'I’m scared. I want to go home; I can tell you that. My 
sisters are growing up, my mom is missing me'

The teenager said at the time she thinks about Mr Griffin's death every day.

Prosecutors claim Mee plotted with her boyfriend, 
Lamont Newton, and his friend, Laron Raiford, to rob Mr Griffin. Newton is still awaiting trial for first degree murder.

She is
 accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old on October 23, 2010, to 
a dark alley in St Petersburg, where the two men robbed then shot him, getting away with $50.

Initially Mee told police the shooting happened because Raiford found out Mr Griffin had been romantically involved with his girlfriend in the past.

But later she changed her story and allegedly confessed she lured Mr Griffin to his death.

Defense strategy: Mee's lawyer said his client had suffered from Tourette's syndrome and didn't know what she was doing

Blame game: Mee contented that her short-lived fame led her astray and drew her into bad company

Mee left home at 17, two years after she became known as 'hiccup 
girl'. She claims her short-lived celebrity 'went to her head' and made 
her go off the rails.

Months of incessant hiccups left her temporarily unable to attend school as she disrupted other students.

She tried home remedies and consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist, a
 chiropractor, and an acupuncturist, until the hiccups finally just 
stopped on their own a few weeks later.

Her lawyer, Trevena, said: 'If you really believe her story, she’s really not guilty of anything except poor judgement of who she associated with.'
