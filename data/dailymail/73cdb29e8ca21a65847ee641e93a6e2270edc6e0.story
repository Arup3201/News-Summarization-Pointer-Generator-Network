One look at her stunned face and you get the feeling Prince Philip has been telling another of his rather playful jokes.

And it seems that the Duke of Edinburgh’s little witticism got a big laugh as he opened a family planning clinic yesterday.

The 92-year-old remarked: ‘At least you are all legitimate!’

Procedure: Buckingham Palace said that the Duke had the medical procedure carried out at the palace yesterday morning

Soldiering on: The Duke - true to form - has pledged to keep on with his engagements

His listeners appeared somewhat 
shocked and one held her hand to her mouth. Mike Waddington, a spokesman
 for the Margaret Pyke clinic in North London, said it was: ‘Very, very 
good natured. The prince got a big round of applause and his response 
was to say that joke, and he got another laugh.’

Prince
 Philip wore a bandage  on his right hand, but it did not cast a damper 
on his mischievous spirits. He later appeared at a  Buckingham Palace 
garden party, in excellent shape.

Musician Rick Wakeman said: ‘He shook 
my hand as normal. I’ve been lucky enough to meet him a few times, and 
he’s always been on fine form. I just find the pair of them amazing. I’m
 openly a huge royalist.’

Later, he was seen greeting guests at the first garden party of the season in the grounds of Buckingham Palace

Despite the procedure, he offered his right hand around, refusing to let an operation get in the way of protocol

As the prince supported himself on his umbrella, he joked with guests about the bag-sized ones on the grass

The
 Queen wore a lavender coat and dress by Angela Kelly for the first 
garden party of the season, attended by about 8,000 guests.

Royal
 sources said the prince had minor surgery at the Palace on Tuesday. It 
is not known why the prince, who is right-handed, needed the procedure.

Four
 years ago he had an operation on his left hand for carpal tunnel 
syndrome, which causes pain and numbness. He has suffered from a 
rheumatoid condition called synovitis, and gave up polo aged 50 due to 
arthritis in his wrist.

He plans to mark his 93rd birthday on June 10 at a garden party.

Prince Philip wore a top hat for the occasion, which he later clutched in his bandaged hand alongside his wife

Fighting fit: He held his umbrella in his wounded hand showing he has bounced back from the operation

Both royals looked healthy and active as they paced down the stairs talking to each other

Energetic: The Duke was in good spirits and joked with staff as he opened the Margaret Pyke Centre today

In recent years, the prince has suffered several bouts of ill-health, however, the most serious of which was over Christmas 2011 when he was rushed into hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery, which involved him having a stent fitted

He was also forced to pull out of several key engagements to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012 having developed a severe bladder infection after being forced to stand for hours in driving wind and rain during a celebratory river pageant.

He also spent his birthday - June 10 - last year in hospital after undergoing an ‘exploratory’ operation for unexplained abdominal pain. The results of the tests have never been released.

Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy - you might as well take your life in your hands.’

‘The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss'.
