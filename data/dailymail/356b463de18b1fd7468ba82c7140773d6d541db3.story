Everyone knows that if you want to wear Chanel you've got to put your hand in your pocket.

Karl Largerfeld's latest offering for AW14 is luxury headphones and we do mean luxury.

The quilted leather accessory will be on every fashionista's wish list - but whether they can afford them is another matter altogether.

Chanel has confirmed to MailOnline that they will have a price tag of an eye-watering £4,170, Chanel confirmed with MailOnline today.

Chanel are releasing their newest fashion accessory mid-September, a pair of £5,250 headphones

That's about the same as a small car, but the quality both inside and out is said to be exceptional.

Karl has collaborated with trendy tech firm Monster for the unique pairing of 'timeless aesthetics and supreme audio 
technology'.

With
 a heavy splash of Chanel's iconic style, these headphones 
feature the couture brand's signature quilting with a double C monogram and matching carry case.

While they debuted at the Chanel Autumn Winter 2014 catwalk show in Paris this March, their official release date has only just been announced.

And when we contacted Chanel to confirm, they said: 'These headphones are from the AW14/15 collection and cost £4,170. The collection is available from CHANEL boutiques in mid September.'

Metro's Tech Editor James Day comments:

'Audio brand Monster are no strangers to the outrageous, having recently teamed up with Lamborghini to release a limited edition €3.3 million Veneno sports car.

'The company used to make headphones for Beats by Dre before an acromonious split sent both companies in different directions. Monster has concetrated on high-profile collaborations with fashion and sporting brands, so set a of Chanel headphones doesn't come as a huge surprise. 

'What does, however, is that price tag. While the sound is likely to be exceptional it's possibly nothing you wouldn't experience on a pair costing a tenth of the price. You are probably, as you might expect, paying for the exclusivity and the Chanel name.   

'But they actually look pretty smooth, and given Monster has a penchant for the garish designs popular with Americans, Karl Largerfeld's has clearly had plenty of input here.'
