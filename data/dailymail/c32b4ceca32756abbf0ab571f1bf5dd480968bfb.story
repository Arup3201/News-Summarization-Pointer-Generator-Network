Izzy McCarron, nine, saved her father's life by kicking him in the chest to restart his heart after he suffered a severe allergic reaction at home

A schoolgirl saved her father's life by kicking him in the chest after he suffered a severe allergic reaction which stopped his heart.

Izzy McCarron, nine, restarted father Colm's heart by stamping on his chest after he collapsed at home and stopped breathing.

Izzy's mother, Debbie, immediately called 999 but Izzy knew paramedics would never arrive in time to save her father, so decided to use CPR.

However she quickly discovered her arms weren't strong enough, so she stamped on her father's chest instead.

Debbie then took over with some more conventional chest compressions until the ambulance arrived.

Izzy, who has been given a bravery award by her school, said: 'I just kicked him really hard. My mum taught me CPR but I knew I wasn't strong enough to use hands. I was quite scared.

'The paramedics said I might as well be a doctor or a nurse. My mum said that he was going to hospital with a giant footprint on his chest.'

'She's a little star,' said Debbie. 'I was really upset but Izzy just took over. I just can't believe what she did. I really think all children should be taught first aid.'

'Izzy did CPR then the paramedics turned up. He had to have two adrenaline shots on the way to the hospital and he's now been given an EpiPen and we've got to see a specialist.'

Forklift truck driver Colm, from Chapel-en-le-Frith had suffered a mystery allergic reaction on Saturday and been taken to hospital, but was sent home only for it to happen again the next day.

Colm, 35, suffered a mystery allergic reaction last Saturday and went to hospital but was sent home, when it happened again the next day

Those who suffer from allergic reactions often develop anaphalaxis, a severe and rapid onset of symptoms which often involves itchy skin, swelling of the face or difficultly breathing.

In very acute cases the sufferer can stop breathing as their airway swell, their blood pressure can drop suddenly, and their heart can beat irregularly or even stop altogether, as in Colm's case.

He has now made a full recovery from his ordeal.
