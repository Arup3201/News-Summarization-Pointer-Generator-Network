Police are hunting four masked men who burst into a man's house in the middle of the night and ripped off his penis.

Fei Lin, 41, was asleep in bed at his home in Niqiao village near Wenling city in east China's Zhejiang province when the attackers struck at 4am.

The men put a bag over his head, Mr Lin told police.

He said: 'They put something over my head and pulled down my trousers and then they ran off.

'I was so shocked I didn't feel a thing - then I saw I was bleeding and my penis was gone.'

It is thought Mr Lin was targeted because he had been having a number of affairs with local married women.
