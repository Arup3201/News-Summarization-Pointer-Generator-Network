Residents have complained about new lampposts they say look like UFOs

Workmen have been forced to abandon fitting new eco-friendly lampposts on a leafy estate because householders say they look like flying saucers.

Furious residents are adamant the new lamps are alien to the landscape. They insist they are 'not in keeping with the historic character' of the pretty 22-acre conservation site.

They were outraged when pavements outside their £250,000 homes in Birmingham's Selly Park were dug-up to make way for the modern aluminium street furniture.

The new environmentally-friendly lights were supposed to cut light pollution.

But angry locals of the 100-year-old estate complained to Birmingham City Council that they did not fit the area's image.

Now contractors working for the authority have been forced to halt work on the streets because of the controversy.

The town hall now faces finding extra cash to fund so-called 'heritage-style' lamps for the estate - which has always been adorned with cast iron street signs and old-fashioned swan-necked street lamps.

Former Birmingham city councillor Andy Foster lives in the area.

The 59-year-old claimed work started last week without warning.

He said: 'A hole appeared in the footpath outside my house, about six feet from my front window, where there had not been a lamppost before.

'They started work a week before they said they were going to so we were shocked.

'When we complained, we discovered the 
contractors working for the council do a rather nice looking lamppost 
for conservation areas, so we have asked for them.'

Leafy Fourth Avenue was among the streets where work was to begin installing the lampposts that were alien to the estate

Even though the new ones 'were supposed to be terribly efficient and green' Andy thought it 'best to have the heritage ones.'

'We’ve got them to have a temporary stop but the city council might have to find some extra money to install the heritage lampposts,' he said.

The hole outside Andy Foster's home was ready for the new lighting until locals expressed their unhappiness about the shiny new lighting.

Another disgruntled resident was Thomas Bonham.

The 51-year-old said: 'I couldn’t believe it when they said they were going to install these monstrosities in our area.

'They look like flying saucers or something from one of those sci-fi films. They are an absolute eyesore.

'It doesn’t fit in with the historic feel of the area and it made a lot of the residents feel very angry.'

The leafy estate was awarded conservation area status in 2009, meaning historic features are protected.

As a result of the complaints Amey - contracted to do the council’s highways work for 25 years - has halted the installation and ordered old fashioned lampposts instead.

An Amey spokeswoman admitted they will cost the council more.She said: 'Residents were concerned that, although their roads are listed as a conservation area, they had not had the opportunity to request an upgrade to heritage-style streetlights.

'As a consequence of the concerns raised, the lighting improvement works in the area have been put on hold in order that a review can be undertaken.

'Normally in a conservation area we would look if they wanted heritage lights but that didn’t happen this time for some reason.

'It’s a case of talking to the residents and finding out what they want and finding a way forward that pleases everyone.

'There’s an extra cost to the heritage lights and councillors will need to find the funding from their constituency committee.'
