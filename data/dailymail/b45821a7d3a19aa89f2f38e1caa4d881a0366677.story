Blything, 41, from Wavertree, Liverpool, denies using racist language at the 1-1 draw between Everton and QPR on October 21

A football fan has appeared in court accused of calling one Premier League player a ‘monkey’ and another a ‘chink'.

William Blything, 41, is alleged to have hurled the insults at Korean Queen's Park Rangers captain Park Ji-Sung and Everton midfielder Victor Anichebe when he was at a match with his wife.

Police picked Blything, from Wavertree, Liverpool, out from photographs of the crowd at Loftus Road when a complaint was made after the 1-1 draw on October 21.

Merchant seaman Blything, who is an Everton supporter, told Hammersmith Magistrates' court he would fight the claims and defend himself.

‘I’m not guilty to the racial bit, but I fully admit I used offensive language,’ he said. ‘I’m quite clear I didn’t say that.

‘Any one of 4,000 people could have said that, and I’m getting the blame. My wife heard me swear, but she knows I didn’t say anything racial.’

Speaking in a West Country accent, Blything added witness statements referred to the abuser as yelling in a Liverpool accent.

The court heard fans claim he called Anichebe, originally from Nigeria, a ‘f***ing monkey’, and shouted ‘Take down that chink' at Ji-Sung.

James Dean, prosecuting, said police maintained photographs taken at the game ‘match the defendant exactly.’

Before the match, QPR defender Anton Ferdinand and other teammates caused a stir by refusing to wear a T-shirt from anti-racism group Kick It Out.

Chelsea skipper John Terry last month accepted a four-month suspension and £220,000 fine after racially abusing Ferdinand during a match last October.

Blything denies a single count of racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress.

His trial was fixed for January 21 by District Judge Fiona Barrie who granted him unconditional bail.
