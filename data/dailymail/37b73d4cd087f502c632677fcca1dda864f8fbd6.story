In the moments after Liverpool’s 3-2 victory at Norwich last April, Brendan Rodgers crowned Raheem Sterling as the best young player in European football.

Sterling had scored twice and laid on another for Luis Suarez in a thrilling win at Carrow Road, increasing Liverpool’s lead over Chelsea to five points and six over eventual champions Manchester City.

‘Raheem is arguably the best young player in European football at the moment,’ claimed Rodgers after his exhilarating performance. ‘If he doesn’t win PFA Young Player of the Year it is ridiculous.’

Negotiations over a new Liverpool contract for Raheem Sterling have been going on for some time

They've been sitting round the table trying to thrash out terms on a deal for the next five years

A month later Eden Hazard, four years his senior, won the award after scoring 14 times in 35 appearances in the Barclays Premier League for Chelsea.

Hazard will soon sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge after agreeing, in principle, to a five-year deal worth £200,000 a week.

So what is Sterling, promoted to England’s squad for the World Cup last summer and the recipient of the European Golden Boy award in December, really worth? Unfortunately there is no set formula.

By amortising Sterling’s current valuation in the transfer market - say, for example, £35m - over the period of his proposed five-year contract, he could make a fairly solid case to be paid £7m a year (£134,000 a week). Liverpool’s offer is a long way short of that.

Sterling will be laughing all the way to the bank as he can expect a huge pay rise with his new deal

An alternative is for the club’s managing director Ian Ayre to ask around and build a picture of the salaries commanded by some of Europe’s best young players.

For instance should Sterling, 20, earn more than Paul Pogba, the ‘Mona Lisa of football’, according to his bellicose agent Mino Raiola?

Pogba has scored 18 goals in 80 appearances in Serie A for Juventus and earns £70,000 a week, but he plays in a country that no longer has the same commercial pull as the Premier League.

More than Luke Shaw, who joined Manchester United for £28m last summer from Southampton and is paid £120,000 a week at Old Trafford? Shaw is still only 19 and his form has dipped markedly.

Hazard has also been taking his time over talks on ha new contract to extend his stay in the Premier League

Certainly more than Wilfried Zaha, who signed a contract worth £40,000 a week when he returned to Crystal Palace following his disappointing spell at Manchester United.

How about Martin Odegaard, the 16-year-old Norwegian who opted to sign for Real Madrid last month and is commanding £1m a year net at the Bernabeu?

As much as Philippe Coutinho, who committed his future to Liverpool on February 2 by signing a contract, laced with incentives, worth more than £60,000 a week?

The problem when you ask around in football about players’ salaries is that everyone, in the words of one agent, ‘puts a bit of VAT on them’. On that basis, these figures may not be accurate.

To put Sterling’s career in England into context, two of the best young talents in Brazilian football earn around £10,000 a month each at Fluminense.

Kenedy, a 19-year-old winger at Flu, and Marlon Santos, a defensive midfielder at the same club, are two of the most promising players in Brazil’s Serie A.

How much is Sterling worth if Luke Shaw (above) is on £120,000 a week at Manchester United?

In the recent South America Under 20 tournament in Uruguay, Kenedy came to prominence when he scored a beauty for Brazil against Venezuela. Like Sterling, he belongs in the special talent category.

If Kenedy and Marlon make it in to the national team, they will soon be heading to the Premier League for the really big bucks.

Sterling is operating in a different environment, a place where money talks for the top talent in the English game.

Sterling’s progress has been so rapid, speeding past various milestones in his young career, that he is now in a position to become the highest-paid young player in Europe.

The problem for any club, even for an institution like Liverpool, is that when players are put on a pedestal the club becomes a hostage to fortune.

Everybody appears to be in agreement that this is one of the most talented young players in the game.

Liverpool’s offer, as Rodgers revealed in a briefing before Tuesday's Premier League clash with Tottenham at Anfield, is ‘wonderful’ and ‘incredible’.

That is certain to be the case, but Sterling, who missed the game with Spurs though injury, is entitled to wait.

Age is a constant theme in the negotiations with frequent reminders that Sterling is only 20.

Look at it from Sterling’s position at the negotiating table and he will be entitled to remind Liverpool that he will be in his 26th year by the time this contract ends.

He is in a strong position, particularly because he still has an ace up his sleeve in the form of the incoming television deal.

If Sterling opted to run down his contract at Anfield, by the time the next round of negotiations with his agent takes place, the numbers swilling around the Barclays Premier League will be on their way up again.

Whatever happens, this is a golden age for Sterling.
