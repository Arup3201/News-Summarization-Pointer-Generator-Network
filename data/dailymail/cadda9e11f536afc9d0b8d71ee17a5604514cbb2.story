As she opens her first ever stand-alone store, the inventor, founder and owner Spanx Sara Blakely has spoke about her company's phenomenal success.

Spanx made almost $250 million in sales last year without spending any money on advertising, with women everywhere sharing their love for the slimming under garment through word-of-mouth. And they aren't shy in sharing their love with Ms Blakely herself.

The 41-year-old told ABC News: 'I get flashed at airports. I get flashed at restaurants. I get flashed on the street, I mean, it's fantastic.'

After creating Spanx 13 years ago, Ms Blakely added that she still sometimes can't believe their widespread popularity.

She said: 'It's really hard to digest. I'll see these celebrities and they look gorgeous and they'll say, "I love my Spanx" or "it's because of my Spanx," and it's hard for me to absorb, like, that's a product I created.

Spanx vs no Spanx: Ms Blakely's products re-shape the silhouette, compress, mold, and smooths

'Our brand has made women feel better, more confident,' she added. 'A
lot of women call it "Spanx strong," like, "when I've got my Spanx on, I
sort of feel like it's my Super Woman outfit."'

Spanx was born out of a spontaneous 
epiphany. Ms Blakely cut the feet out of her control-top pantyhose for a
smoother look under a pair of cream-colored pants, but when they 
continued to roll up her leg, she sought out manufactures who could 
help.

And breathe! Kim Kardashian (left) and Sienna Miller (right) are both well-known for taking to the red carpet in Spanx, giving them much needed comfort in their extravagant and tight fitting dresses

Fans: Tyra Banks (left) and Jessica Alba (right) have both said that Spanx are the quick route to a slim figure

She said : 'Every time I put [the pants] on you could see 
the thong. You could see some cellulite on the back of my 
thighs and I thought, "what am I supposed to wear under this?" So I cut 
the feet out of my pantyhose.

Loving Spanx: After creating her slimming product 13 years ago, Ms Blakely says she sometimes can't believe their widespread popularity

'My rear looked firm. My cellulite had been
smoothed out, but they rolled up my legs all night.'

So with 
$5,000 in savings from seven years as fax machine salesperson, she started approaching hosiery manufacturers.

She said: 'One guy called me after I made the rounds, [and said] that "I have 
decided to make your crazy idea." I found out he ran it 
by his daughters over dinner and they said, "Dad, help this girl make 
it. It's a good idea."'

Now, in addition to foot-loose control pantyhose, and the classic shapers that compress, mold, and smoothen, Spanx also makes back fat eliminating bras made out of pantyhose, active wear like yoga pants with built-in tummy tamers, and also fashionable shaping swim suits.

There is also a men's collection of body shaping undershirts and underwear.

After failing the LSAT entrance exam for law school, her simple idea turned her the Forbes' world's youngest self-made female billionaire, and now Spanx sells more than 200 products in over 13 different countries.

She said: 'I was always trying to figure out ways to make money and to do little businesses. My first memory is drawing pictures with my friend on a rainy day and selling them door-to-door.

Adding: 'I'm a horrible test taker, thank God, because life had other plans for me. Spanx would not exist if I did great on the LSAT.

Now, through her charitable foundation, she has contributed over $1 million to causes that support women to achieve their greater life-long goals and fulfill their own potential.
