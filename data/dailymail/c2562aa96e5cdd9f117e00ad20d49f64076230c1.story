With his handsome chestnut plumage and rapacious sexual appetite, the ruddy duck has long been designated a ruddy pest.

Every year, the promiscuous male of the British species flies south to Spain where he ravishes females of the rare white-headed duck.

Such is the ruddy duck’s success with the ladies in Spain – to the humiliating detriment of the cuckolded male white-heads there – that Madrid complained of the threat to its native bird’s survival.

The Spanish Government fears the British-bred ruddy duck is putting their country's species at risk

Not satisfied with one partner, the blue-billed British birds with snow-white cheeks have let their fancies take flight.

They
 fathered so many cross-breed ‘Euro ducklings’ that the precious line of
 white-heads was in danger of being bred out of existence, causing all 
manner of a flutter in diplomatic corridors.

And so, to appease the Spanish, British ministers have spent ten years and £4million trying to slaughter the ruddy duck.

Yesterday
 it emerged they have found a further £120,000 of taxpayers’ money to 
fully exterminate the British species, even though it causes no harm in 
the UK.

An estimated 100 – 
or even as few as  20 – remain, hiding among the reeds  in remote watery
 corners of England, Wales and Scotland.

Now
 there is a £2,500 bounty on each coppery head, and one day the final 
ruddy duck will peer above the rushes and stare down the barrel of a 
hunting rifle.

The massacre 
of the ruddy duck was ordered in 2003 by the Department for the 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs following a series of protests from 
Madrid.

So far the cull has claimed some 5,500 ruddy ducks, causing anger among British conservationists, bird lovers and landowners.

The RSPB has taken the Government’s side, leaving some of its members incensed.

One,
 Roger Barlow, 69, of Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, told the Daily Mail: ‘If
 the Spanish government or environmentalists do not like the idea of the
 ruddy duck mating with their white-head ducks, then they should cull 
them when they arrive in Spain.

'It’s
 what ducks do, and why should we foot the bill? The Canada goose is 
becoming a problem in Britain, but any culling will quite rightly be 
paid for by the British taxpayer.

‘Tell
 Spain to leave well alone or do its own dirty business, and send them a
 bill for costs incurred to date.’ The ruddy duck is native to North and
 South America, where its population is around 700,000.

It
 was introduced to Britain  from the US more than 50 years ago by Sir 
Peter Scott, and since then has slowly established itself across Europe.

Brian Ankers, chairman of 
Woolston Eyes Nature Reserve in Cheshire, told the Sunday Telegraph: 
‘They are beautiful things. It’s very sad and I can’t make sense of it.

‘They’ve
 never been a nuisance here and it seems a ridiculous amount of 
Government money  to spend on getting rid of them.’ Lee Evans, of the 
British Birding Association, said: ‘The whole thing is a fiasco.

‘It’s
 a total waste of public money, and all that will happen when the cull 
stops is that new ducks will fly over from the Continent, and we’ll be 
back to square one.’

There 
are still relatively large populations of ruddy duck in France and 
Netherlands, meaning that even if the British effort is successful, the 
tragic loneliness of male white-head ducks in Spain may continue.

Defra
 said the Government’s action was ‘in line with the commitment of other 
European countries to eradicate ruddy ducks elsewhere by 2015’.
