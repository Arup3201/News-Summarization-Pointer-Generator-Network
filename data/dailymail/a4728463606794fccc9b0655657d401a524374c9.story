For Celtic, February brings the mouth-watering prospect of cup ties against historic foes Rangers and Inter Milan. Sandwiched in between the hotly-anticipated League Cup semi-final and Europa League last 32 tie is the small matter of a Scottish Cup visit of Dundee.

As the club’s make-or-break month approaches, manager Ronny Deila admits he can sense fear in the air. But the terror he detects is not emanating from his Parkhead players, but from their domestic rivals, anxious at facing a Celtic side peaking at the right time.

Deila cited the way Motherwell set out for a goalless draw at Parkhead on Wednesday night, only to lose 4-0 as Celtic returned to the summit of the Premiership, as proof that teams are becoming worried at the damage they could sustain at the hands of the champions.

The Norwegian expects more of the same blend of fear and respect at Ross County on Saturday lunchtime, after the Dingwall side parked the bus and stole a point in Glasgow on December 27.

But as Deila continues to targets a domestic treble, he wants to ensure January ends with a perfect 12 points from 12 ahead of a month he hopes does not end up defining his first season in charge in Scotland.

‘February is going to be a very big month for us,’ smiled the Celtic manager.

‘I am excited. They are going to be very interesting games (against Rangers, Inter Milan and Dundee). The month could define the season but hopefully it won’t because trophies don’t come in February. Hopefully we can extend our run in the competitions beyond next month.

‘I think I am more confident now about my team than I was two or three months ago. I think we are growing more and more together. 

'We understand what we expect from each other, the players and me. That gives me more confidence and I see more confidence in the players. They are also much fitter and sharper than they were before.

‘I think (the Motherwell game) in particular shows that people fear us more than they did before! And, to me, that is good to see. We will have to deal with breaking teams down, like Motherwell. Ross County did the same to us at home and I think it will be a quite similar match on Saturday.

‘Confidence is a very important thing in football. When you win games you get more and more confidence. So to win up in the north is so important because it will give us confidence going into the Rangers match.

‘I’m home a lot, so I don’t get people talking to me much about the Rangers game. But I get it when I come into training. I know what it is about. But I’m taking it a match at a time just now. For me, the league is the most important thing and the first target is beating Ross County.’

After Celtic dropped points at home to the Highlanders last month, Aberdeen took advantage of the champions postponed game at Partick Thistle to go clear at the top of the table.

But Deila’s side have responded by winning each game since their return from Gran Canaria and reclaimed their place at the summit on Wednesday night.

That came days after Aberdeen’s eight game run of wins without conceding came to a halt in a 3-3 home draw with Dundee. Now Deila suggests it is Aberdeen’s turn to see how they deal with questions being asked of their own title bid.

‘I think Aberdeen have a very good team. They should be up there,’ he said.

‘They have had consistency in their team over the period and they have improved. They can win a lot of games.

‘But it is always the same when you are up there fighting for titles that you have to bounce back quick. You can’t have long periods with bad results. You need to maintain a high level over a whole season.

'Now we will see if we can do it and if Aberdeen can do it, or Dundee United, Inverness or whoever. We will see in April if it is two teams or three teams or just one (in the title race).’

It’s not long since striker John Guidetti was boasting of his plans to become the first Celtic player to score a hat-trick against Rangers since Harry Hood at the same stage of the League Cup in 1973.

Despite his iniital 11 goals in 18 appearances on loan from Manchester City, however, the Swede is without a goal in his last six matches and was unused in the rout of Motherwell.

Griffiths is expected to get the nod again when Celtic travel to Ross County on Saturday

In his absence, Leigh Griffiths scored a goal and is expected to be given the nod against Ross County tomorrow with the chance to stake a claim for an Old Firm starting berth.

Whatever happens in Dingwall, Griffiths – who once looked on his way out of Parkhead – has already impressed Deila with his attitude, fitness and a left foot the Celtic boss yesterday labelled ‘world class’.

‘I think Leigh’s a very exciting player,’ Deila said. ‘His left foot is world class. I’ve not seen any player have a better left foot in my life. He has skills but you have to perform over time when you play at Celtic.

‘Leigh looks sharp but he needs more confidence. The goal against Motherwell was very important. I believe in him. I wouldn’t play him if I wanted him to leave. We made some demands of him and he has really worked hard to tune into that. He still needs to improve, everybody does, but he is getting to a new level.

‘His fitness is 100 per cent better than it was and you can see that in matches. He works really hard to close people down.

‘It started with him giving 100 per cent in training. That’s why he got his chance in the team.

‘Leigh is also a fantastic guy. He is always in a good mood and you get a laugh in the dressing room – but he is also hungry to learn.

‘Now he has played the last two games for us and we have won and he has played well. So he is in a better position than three or four weeks ago. It’s clear to see we have big competition for places up front.’
