Shane Warne spent four hours in millionaire businesswoman Michelle Mone’s hotel room – hours after a Valentine’s Day weekend with Liz Hurley.

The 44-year-old former cricketer, who split from the actress last year, reportedly met up with Mone at her suite in London’s Dorchester Hotel on February 16.

Two days earlier, the notorious womaniser had flown to the UK where he visited his ex-fiancee at the £6million Herefordshire mansion they bought in 2012.

Business model: Michelle Mone, in a piece by her lingerie firm, reportedly spent a night with Shane Warne

Warne and Miss Hurley spent the night there before travelling to London and spending a second night together at her townhouse.

They
 were believed to be trying to rekindle their relationship, with Warne 
recently hinting they were on the verge of a reconciliation.

But
 the Australian is said to have visited Mone, 42, at lunchtime the 
following day, apparently taking champagne and roses to her £500-a-night
 eighth-floor suite.

The 
pair emerged separately four hours later, with the underwear firm boss 
heading to the BBC’s central London office to appear on Radio 5Live 
show, On The Money.

Mone, 
who divorced ex-husband Michael in January last year, flew back to 
Scotland the next day, while Warne jetted to Las Vegas to take part in a
 poker tournament.

Last night, on her Twitter page, Mone said she would never ‘meet a guy if he was taken’.

The
 businesswoman tweeted: ‘Thanks for all your messages, most lovely but 
for the rest of you, FTR [for the record] I’d never ever meet a guy if 
he was taken. It was done to me and I remember that pain.’

She
 added: ‘Not that it’s anyone’s biz but I’ve been single for 18 months, 
very independent, successful and don’t need anyone for anything other 
than my family.’

The mother-of-three was at home in her luxurious Glasgow townhouse yesterday.

She
 cancelled a speaking engagement at the Scottish Wedding Show, on behalf
 of her lingerie company Ultimo, where she was due to appear at 2pm. 
Mone, who was at the two-day event on Saturday, was said to be ill.

Warne
 last night brushed off the claims about his meeting with the 
entrepreneur, writing on Twitter: ‘Just read some more ludicrous & 
laughable reporting on me, what an absolute load of rubbish! Whatever, 
time to rack up the air miles again.’

Warne
 is not the first sportsman to be linked to Mone. In 2012 married 
footballer Robbie Savage was seen leaving her home in the early hours 
following an award ceremony earlier that evening. The pair claimed they 
are just friends.

On February 11, Miss Mone appeared with Abbey Clancy to launch the Valentine's Collection for Ultimo

Warne was seen flying over to the UK from Melbourne on February 11 before heading straight to the £6million mansion he used to share with actress Liz

Mone, 
said to be worth £50million, separated from her husband of 20 years in 
2011. Months later, she claimed he had cheated on her with an Ultimo 
designer, which Mr Mone denied.

The pair had founded their lingerie firm from a spare bedroom in 1996 and launched the first Ultimo bra in 1999.

Modelled
 by stars including Penny Lancaster and Rachel Hunter – as well as Mone 
herself – its cleavage-enhancing qualities proved a huge hit with 
millions of women.

Its popularity was boosted in 2000 when Julia Roberts wore one of the bras for her role in Erin Brockovich.

Mone
 embraced the limelight as the company’s public face, and boosted her 
profile with TV appearances on MasterChef and The Apprentice. In 2010, 
she was awarded an OBE for her contribution to business.

Talking
 about the break-up of her marriage, she said recently: ‘Now I think 
that I’m the strongest I’ve ever been, the fittest I’ve ever been and 
I’ve managed to get every single part of my life sorted out.’

In
 November, Mone opened the doors of her new home in Glasgow for an 
exclusive photoshoot for HELLO! magazine, giving readers a tour of the 
swanky four-storey Victorian townhouse which she spent nine months 
transforming from offices into a family home.
