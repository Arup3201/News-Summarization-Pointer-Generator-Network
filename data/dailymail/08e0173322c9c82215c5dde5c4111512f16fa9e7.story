A direct link between brain and tooth size may seem unlikely, but Spanish researchers have revealed some surprising results.

Throughout the 2.5 million year history of man and his ancestors, the size of teeth have decreased in size as our brains have become larger.

The scientists described the finding as an ‘evolutionary paradox’ and said that it could be due to how our diet has changed.

Big bite: Researchers have discovered that primates in the human lineage 2.5 million years ago had smaller brains but bigger teeth than we do today

They also claimed that it is the first time they have seen such a relationship.

Humans (Homo sapiens) are primates of the family Hominidae, and are the only species of the Homo that still exist.

Humans are characterised by having a large brain relative to body size, with a particularly well developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, making them capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, problem solving and culture through social learning.

Experts believe Homo sapiens originated in Africa, and fossils show it resembled modern humans about 200,000 years ago, and began to behave like them around 50,000 years ago.

It would be expected that as our brains grow in size, we would need to eat more in order to sustain a higher metabolism.

But the scientists say that eating more nutritious food, such as animal meat, has enabled us to eat less while still getting the proteins, fats and so on that we need.

Larger brains have also enabled the Homo genus to make key innovations including using tools, planting crops and farming that have given us access to better food.

‘Brain volume and cheek-tooth size have traditionally been considered as two traits that show opposite evolutionary trends during the evolution of Homo,’ the scientists, led by Juan Manuel Jiménez-Arenas, write in their research article.

‘Here we show that there is an essential difference between the genus Homo and the living primate species,’ they add.They go on to add Homo is the only primate to show ‘an inverse relationship’ in teeth and brain size.

The research was carried out by studying the size of post-canine teeth in a variety of primates.

The shrinking of teeth may also be due to the inactivation of a gene called MYH16.

This is linked to the structure of the brain, which fell in size about 2.4 million years ago.

Both this theory and that of a changing diet might be the solution to this puzzling evolutionary trend that has left scientists stumped.

What will become of our teeth in future as we get smarter and smarter remains to be seen.

But, conversely, they also had smaller brains than we do today

This makes ‘Homo’ the only primate whose tooth size decreases as brain size increases
