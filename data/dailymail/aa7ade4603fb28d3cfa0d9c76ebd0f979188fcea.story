A 16-year-old cheerleader with Down syndrome was called a liability by school officials in Deer Park, Texas, and prevented from joining the rest of her squad pitch-side on Tuesday night.

Brittany Davila, a freshman at Deer Park High School, recently made the team as an honorary cheerleader.

When she and her parents arrived for Tuesday night’s volleyball game, school officials told them Brittany could no longer be part of the team because she was a liability.

Brittany Davila, a 16-year-old cheerleader with Down syndrome, was forced to cheer from the stands on Tuesday night after school officials in Deer Park, Texas, called her a 'liability'

Freshman Brittany Davila was recently made an honorary cheerleader, but she was prevented her from performing pitch-side on Tuesday night

‘Being a parent of a child with special needs, the last thing you want to hear is your kid is a liability for any reason,’ Mom Buffy Davila told Click2Houston.

Despite showing up at the game in full uniform, Brittany was told to sit in the stands.

‘She didn’t understand what changed from last week to this week,’ her father Ruben told KHOU. ‘She was cheering along with them in the stands. She was excited, waving at them and blowing kisses.’

On Wednesday Brittany’s parents met with school officials to hear why they had decided that their daughter was a liability.

School officials expressed their concerns about Brittany's safety and that she might get run over by a player or accidentally hit by the ball.

The Davilas said their daughter was no more of a liability than any other member of the cheer leading squad.

‘She's no more of a safety risk, or however you want to word it, than any of the other cheerleaders that are standing on the sideline,’ said Mrs. Davila.

In the end a resolution was reached which addressed the school's concerns, but also allows Brittany to continue with the activity that she loves.

Brittany has been cheering since junior high and hopes to continue all the way through high school.

‘These kids are people, just like everybody else,’ said Mrs. Davila. ‘They don't want to be treated different. They want to be treated just like the rest of the kids that are around them.’
