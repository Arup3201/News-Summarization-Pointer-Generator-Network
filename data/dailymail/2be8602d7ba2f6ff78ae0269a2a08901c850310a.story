Louis van Gaal’s decision to sell Danny Welbeck for £16m is one of the most controversial transfers in Manchester United history.

On Monday night, after he scored twice in an England shirt in his first start since a deadline day transfer to Arsenal, it felt like one of the biggest mistakes they have ever made.

One goal, against Switzerland in this Euro 2016 qualifier, was embarrassing enough for van Gaal. Two feels like humiliation.

At the double: Welbeck wraps up the points for England in added time

Welbeck was one of their own at United, a homegrown talent who came through the club’s academy to become a first team player. They treated him like a son. He is Arsenal and England through and through now, that is for sure.

High up in the stands, where Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis was sat alongside FA chairman Greg Dyke, they were entitled to a satisfied smile. Welbeck’s double took the heat off them both.

Goals pay the rent and Welbeck, who has craved the chance to start as a centre forward for club and country, duly delivered.

Welbeck took his chance because of the injury to Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge. He is the man in possession of the jersey now.

Crowded out: Wayne Rooney attracts the attention of three Swiss players

His tail has been up for a week or so, eager to please after Arsenal held off the threat of Tottenham to sign him in the last moments leading up to the close of the transfer window.

This week he will be acquainted with his new team-mates as they prepare for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City at the Emirates. He has to start.

Against Switzerland, a half decent international team ranked ninth in the world, England played with speed and purpose when they surged forward. More of this please.

Most of it was down to the mesmerising touches of Raheem Sterling, playing at the top of the diamond and an obvious supply line for Wayne Rooney and Welbeck up top.

Tussle: Raheem Sterling and Valon Behrami battle for possession

At times it was hard to keep an eye on this attacking trident as they rotated positions and popped up all over the park. Sterling, in particular, was an absolute joy to watch. 

When Sterling spins off his marker, dropping deep to demand the ball off his centre-halves you know that he is comfortable playing at this level.

These deep-lying missions are reminiscent of Zidane or Maradona, the little nuances that separated these two superstars of world football from the mere mortals they counted for team-mates.

Sterling is picking up some good habits along the way.

Not everything he does comes off, but that’s the life of a luxury player. You lose the ball, you start the cycle all over again until you win it back.

Leading the line: Welbeck in action with Switzerland's Ricardo Rodriguez

Sterling is growing into his role, driving his team forward with those runs when the ball seems to bobble off his knees, shins and his boots. Somehow he remains in possession.

It seems too soon to pin our hopes on the development of this little fella, but that’s what it has come down to. He looks our best bet.

Sterling seems unfazed by everything around him, happy to receive the ball in any position on the field. In possession, there is an air of expectancy.

When he is on the ball he makes you want to believe, as he did when he latched on to Rooney’s pass inside the area in the second half.

Welbeck eased off his marker at the back post and arrived in time to put England ahead.

The work on this trio continue when they meet up again next month for the San Marino and Estonia, but the signs are encouraging.

Welbeck will be a little frustrated with his failure to find Rooney or Sterling after he mugged Switzerland left-back Ricardo Rodriguez in the first half.

He should have found one of them, but his final ball let him down. Still, the bigger picture is his goalscoring contribution.

His second came in injury time, an emphatic finish beyond Yann Sommer underlined a fairly impressive England performance.

In a couple of days’ time van Gaal will attempt to explain why he elected to sell Welbeck to Arsenal on deadline day.

Like Welbeck’s performance for England, it will make compulsive viewing.
