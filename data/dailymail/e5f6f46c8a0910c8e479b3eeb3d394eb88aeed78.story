Indiana Pacers center Roy Hibbert unleashed a tirade filled with homophobia and profanity during a press conference following his team's victory over the Miami Heat in Game Six of the Eastern Conference Finals.

Hibbert, who scored 24 points during his team's 91-77 win Saturday, quickly received a $75,000 fine from the NBA for his remarks.

But it isn't just the profanity that has people talking about Hibbert's bizarre rant - in addition to calling the media 'motherf**kers,' Hibbert also used a slur against homosexuals when asked about defending Heat strong forward Lebron James.

While discussing the lack of help he'd provided teammate Paul George in covering James during game three of the best of seven series, Hibbert said 'no homo' after telling reporters that James had 'stretched me out so much.'

Shortly after that jab, Hibbert was asked why he was so low in voting for Defensive Player of Year, an honor determined by sports journalists who cover the NBA.

'Because y'all (motherf**kers) don't watch us play throughout the year, to tell you the truth," he said, later adding that he doesn't care if he gets fined by the league for his outburst.

'No homo?'

Hibbert has since changed his tune, issuing a statement apologizing to fans and those he may have offended.

'I am apologizing for insensitive remarks made during the postgame press conference after our victory over Miami Saturday night,' Hibbert says in the statement.

'They were disrespectful and offensive and not a reflection of my personal views. I used a slang term that is not appropriate in any setting, private or public, and the language I used definitely has no place in a public forum, especially over live television. I apologize to those who I have offended, to our fans and to the Pacersâ€™ organization. I sincerely have deep regret over my choice of words last night.'
