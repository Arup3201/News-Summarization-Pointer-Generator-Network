The Duchess of Cornwall picked up a present for Prince George as she toured the Sandringham Flower Show.

Stopping at the Women's Institute stand at the event on the Queen's Norfolk estate, Camilla opened her purse to buy a chimney sweep knitted doll for her grandson, who turned one this month.

Inspecting her purchase, she commented: 'Isn't he sweet?'

One thing that was not so sweet was the odour in one of the flower tents.

As he entered, Charles wrinkled his nose and commented to his escort: 'There's an awful smell of cow pats in here.'

The couple, who arrived in a horse and cart, were joined by their friends Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith, who are staying with them at Sandringham estate.

Last night the group attended a Music in Country Churches concert at the the Church of St Mary in Old Hunstanton.

About 20,000 people attended the horticultural show with many waiting patiently to catch a glimpse of the Royal party.

Susan Parsons, who chatted to Charles and Camilla, said she had arrived from Spalding in Lincolnshire at 7am in order to bag a good spot.

Flower girl: Five year old Hollie Ford was given the honour of presenting the Duchess of Cornwall with a posy on her arrival so the little girl practiced her curtsey beforehand

She added: 'He told me it was great fun being a grandfather.'

As they toured the exhibits, dog-loving Camilla frequently stopped to admire other people's pets.

The Duchess, who has a dog of the same breed, crouched to pat Jack Russell Scooby.

Now in its 133rd year, the event at the Queen's Norfolk retreat is one of the country's most prestigious horticultural events.

Charles, who is patron of the Sandringham Estate Cottage Horticultural Society, and Camilla viewed vegetables, fruit and flower entries and met some of the exhibitors as they visit the show.

Leading nurseries and horticultural specialists exhibit in the show alongside display gardens, around 200 trade stands and a craft marquee.

The profits from each show are donated to local charities and since 1977 the show committee has given more than Â£500,000 to good causes.
