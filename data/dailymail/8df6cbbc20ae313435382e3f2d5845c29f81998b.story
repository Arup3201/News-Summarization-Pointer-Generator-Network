The leader of a criminal
gang suspected of conspiring with Mexican police to kill 43
missing students in the violent southwestern state of Guerrero
has been detained, authorities said on Friday.

The students went missing near Iguala, Guerrero on Sept. 26
after clashing with police and masked men, sending shockwaves
across Mexico and prompting thousands to march in the beach
resort of Acapulco on Friday to demand answers about their fate.

Authorities have arrested dozens of police, who are believed
to have links to a gang called Guerreros Unidos, or 'United
Warriors,' which split from the infamous Beltran Levya Cartel.

More than 1,200 security forces are looking for the college students around Iguala, where the aspiring teachers were last seen on September 26, when local police allegedly attacked them and turned them over to the Guerreros Unidos gang

On Friday, officials said they had captured the group's
leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, along with a collaborator,
weapons and vehicles.

They said he was currently giving a
statement to authorities.

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam told a televised press
conference the arrest marked 'the beginning of a new route of
investigation that can lead us more quickly and easily to the
truth.'

Thousands of protesters marched in Acapulco on Friday to demand the safe return of 43 students who went missing in southern Mexico

The announcement of the detention came only hours after protesters marched in Acapulco demanding the students be returned. 

'We are angry because this is not an isolated event,' teacher Magdalena Catalan, 34, told reporters. 'Many of us are parents and we see very ugly things in this country that we want to fight.' 

The government is combing the hills of southern Guerrero state with horseback patrols and is sending divers to look in lakes and dams, but has not found the youths missing since Sept. 26

Protesters chanted 'they took them alive, we want them back alive,' as they marched.

A farmer who protested but was not identified tied reporters: 'We are enraged against the government. It's going to be a month (since the disappearance) and we have seen nothing.' 

Drug violence exploded in Mexico, claiming about 100,000 lives since 2007

The case has undermined President Enrique Pena Nieto's
pledge to restore order to Mexico.

Drug violence exploded during
the rule of his predecessor, Felipe Calderon, and has claimed
about 100,000 lives since 2007.

The Telegraph reports that Guerreros Unidos had been in league with corrupt municipal leaders in an outbreak of violence that left six dead and the 43 aspiring teachers missing this September. 

36 other municipal officers have also been arrested in connection to the case.
