Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell is 'going through hell' with his child sex offences case, his sisters revealed today.

Glenis Gill and Susan Welcott said they are standing by their brother as he faces charges including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity with a child at Manchester magistrates court.

Gill told the Sunday Mirror: 'The whole thing came out of the blue and left Michael really shocked.'

'It is a really tough time for him at the moment and he will be glad when this is all over. But he is bearing up OK.'

Susan, 53, added: 'All I can I say is Iâ€™m here to protect him and that is what I will do.'

The 48-year-old actor plays mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 series, but has recently said he fears he will not be allowed to return even if he is found innocent.

He has been spotted drinking at his local pub in recent weeks and at a bookmakers near where he lives in Hale, Greater Manchester, giving a defiant thumbs up and whistling as he walked past photographers.

However, friends say Le Vell, a divorced father of two, is living on takeaways and has lost half a stone in recent weeks.

Gill, a 59-yer-old bar manager, agreed that his life had been on hold since the charges emerged.

The alleged sex offences all relate to one child and took place between 2001 and 2010, the court was told in February.

Le Vell was first arrested in September 2011 after the girl, now a teenager, claimed he had sexually assaulted her from the age of six.

Three months later prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence and the charges were dropped. Then came the CPS review.

In a statement Le Vell said he would fight the allegations 'vigorously'.

He is due to appear at Manchester Crown Court this month.
