A young football fan battling brain cancer decided to nickname his tumor ‘Michigan’ because as a Ohio State fan he believes his team will always beat their arch rivals.

Seventh grader Grant Reed of Bellville, Ohio, was diagnosed last year and doctors at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus acted quickly to cut the tumor from his brain.

The operation has left Grant with work to do to overcome stroke-like symptoms, while he has already bravely endured months of radiation and chemotherapy to try to stop the spread of the disease.

Grant took the decision to nickname his cancer 'Michigan' when it was first explained to him that he had cancer and since then his while family have referred to his tumor by the name of their arch rivals

Grant took the decision to nickname his cancer ‘Michigan’ when he and his parents first sat down with his oncologist to explain to him what was making him sick.

‘Grant wasn’t exactly sure what we were talking about,’ his father Troy told CBS News. ‘And when she dropped the c-word in the room, he was like, "Woah. No. No."'

Instead of using the c-word, Grant decided it would be called ‘Michigan’ and insisted everyone in his life refer to it as such from then forward.

'And I'm like, "Why do you want to call it that?'" said Troy. 'And he goes, "Because Ohio State always beats Michigan." That was something he could understand and make it into a competition. He was going to beat this disease.’

Grant's parents Troy and Denise were both in the Ohio State University marching band and got engaged during halftime of the Michigan game

Grant has been an Ohio State fan from before he was born. His parents, Troy and Denise, were both in the team’s marching band and got engaged during halftime of the Michigan game.

Their cat is even named Buckeye, which is the team’s nickname.

The good news for Grant is that his positive approach is working wonders. It has been over a year since his diagnosis and Grant’s doctors have said that he is responding well to treatment.

No doubt Grant and his family where cheering their team on on Saturday afternoon when Ohio State came from behind to beat their arch rivals Michigan 42:41.
