Really, the only surprise was that it took him three touches. Harry Kane had already chested one down in midfield and rolled a pass to fellow substitute Ross Barkley. But his third touch? Well, that was headed into the net. That’s more like it, Harry.

So much for the cries for patience. Here was goal No 30 of the season for a young man who simply cannot stop scoring. Twenty nine for his club and now one for his country at senior level.

Raheem Sterling clipped an inviting ball up to the back post, where Kane’s instinct had taken him. There was just a thin slice of goal to aim for, but he was never missing. Giedrius Arlauskis, unaware of the script, attempted to recover, flinging himself across his goal-line but Lithuania’s goalkeeper could only help it into the net.

Ratings by Rob Draper 

Somehow, it all seemed preordained, as if you could have tied up Kane’s bootlaces, blindfolded him, sat him on a chair in the centre of the penalty area and he would still have scored somehow.

The 21-year-old Tottenham striker, who has been on fire in the Barclays Premier League, was off and running in international football 79 seconds after replacing Wayne Rooney.

Who needs time to adjust? This was the third-fastest goal by an England debutant and the quickest since Bill Nicholson in 1951.

Quite understandably, Kane could barely control his delight, pushing the referee aside as he sprinted into to a jubilant knee-slide by the corner flag while the Wembley crowd leapt to hail their newest hero.

All this was quite surreal. No wonder he described it as ‘just a blur’.

The fourth goal of an easy win against a team ranked 94th in the world in the midst of a humdrum campaign has no right to command such excitement but it is impossible not to be swept along by this incredible story.

Until then it had all been about Rooney’s steady pursuit of Sir Bobby Charlton’s England goal record and Danny Welbeck’s wonderful display of attacking verve, which rightly earned him the man-of-the-match vote.

Rooney needed less than six minutes to score the opener and might have had more on a night when he hit the woodwork twice in the first half. England’s second was probably an own goal but was claimed by Welbeck, who deserved it in a way for a display which justified Hodgson’s decision to select him and leave Kane on the bench for three-quarters of the game.

Sterling converted the third — his first international goal — timing his run to perfection and tucking away Rooney’s cross from the right.

It meant England had secured their fifth successive win in Group E long before Kane came on to thrill Wembley.

Hodgson will reflect on the game with satisfaction. His team are six points clear with one foot already across the Channel at Euro 2016, and promising young players like Kane are forcing their way into contention.

The manager will also have been content with his team’s balance and shape, which flexed from a 4-1-4-1 into a classic 4-3-3 when England had the ball.

Michael Carrick sat in front of the centre halves and supplied a trio of mobile strikers, while Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph covered the midfield miles.

It will be different in a tougher game when Carrick is expected to shield his back four, but here is the perennial problem.

England need one method to qualify — breaking down teams who surrender possession and offer no ambition — and an entirely different one when they reach the finals and come up against more clinical and potent opposition.

Lithuania started nervously at Wembley and Hodgson’s team were smart enough to take advantage. Rooney hit the inside of a post having been released by Delph, before scoring his 47th England goal with a simple header after Arlauskis had pushed a fine effort from Welbeck into the air.

England’s captain hit the other post midway through the first half. Again, Welbeck created it, this time by driving to the by-line and picking out Rooney at the far post. His header was firmly sent back from whence it came, as in the textbooks, and Wembley held its breath as it looped through the air and hit the frame of the goal. 

Fabian Delph was denied a first goal in an England shirt as his crisp volley was repelled by an excellent reflex save from Arlauskis

As England began to wonder if they would extend their lead, they enjoyed a little luck by way of a scruffy second. Henderson worked a short corner with Leighton Baines and delivered an inswinging cross towards Welbeck, who stooped and skewed a glancing header off his shoulder which was deflected into the net from the right thigh of Lithuania captain Tadas Kijanskas.

It was swiftly declared as Welbeck’s goal, and the Arsenal striker seemed happy to claim it. Arlauskis reacted well to keep out Delph’s volley after the break and Welbeck deserved a penalty as England dominated.

Sterling, who grew into the game and was far more influential as Lithuania tired, celebrated his first international goal by tucking in a cross from Rooney via the near post.

And then Kane appeared to a raucous reception. This crowd believed the hype.

They had cheered through his warm-up routine and they demanded a goal as he sprinted on. No sweat. He promptly delivered. It wasn’t an easy finish. But it was never really in doubt, was it?

On the bench, Rooney stood to applaud and like everyone else present, he could not help but smile and shake his head.
