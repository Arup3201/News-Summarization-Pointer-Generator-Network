Ben Davies had no doubt in his mind about joining Tottenham, despite interest from Liverpool.

Swansea had received offers from both clubs for the Welsh left back however Davies declined the offer to join Brendan Rodgers’ side - and the chance to play Champions League football – to link up with Mauricio Pochettino's North London outfit.

His £10million movie was completed yesterday and just hours later he was thrown into action in a 3-2 win over Toronto FC in a pre-season friendly.

‘It is a long season and we need cover in every position.’

Two goals from Erik Lamela and a late strike from Andros Townsend secured victory over MLS side Toronto.

‘I’m very pleased because we had a very good performance to help us learn about the new philosophy. It is another 90 minutes to improve our new style.’
