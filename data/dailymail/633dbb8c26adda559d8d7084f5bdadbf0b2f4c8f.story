Police have discovered four bodies inside a home in an upscale neighborhood of Orange County, California.

Neighbors told the Los Angeles Times that a 'perfect Christian family' lived there - though the victims have only been identified officially as 'two males and two females.'

Detectives believe one of the people inside the house killed the other three and then committed suicide, Orange County Sheriff's Lr Jeff Hallock told the Orange County Register.

Police have not identified the four victims found dead inside this $650,000 house in Orange County, California

A team of detectives and crime scene investigators enter the home where four bodies were found

Lt Hallock said detectives 'aren't 't looking for a suspect' - code that detectives believed the killer is among the dead inside the home, possibly from a murder-suicide.

Homeowner: The home at 25601 Pacific Hills Drive is owned by Mark and Lydia Sheer. Mr Sheer is a business coach according to his website

The home at 25601 Pacific Hills Drive in Mission Viego, California is owned by Mark and Lydia Sheer, according to public records.

Police were called to the home around 9am and found the four bodies inside. They would not say whether the victims were related.

They also have not commented on how the victims died or where in the house they were found.

Mr Sheer works as a 'tactical business coach', according to his website.

He gives seminars and acts as a 'mentor' to start-up businesses.

A man named Michael who identified himself as a longtime friend and business partner to the Registered called Tuesday's slayings 'surreal'.

Michael said that Sheer was a family man who taught bible study at Mount of Olives Lutheran Church. The Sheers had 'great kids' - an adult son and teenage daughter.

A woman who answered the phone Tuesday afternoon at Sheer's office told the register that 'the family doesn't want to talk to anyone right now'.

Police have not said how the people inside died - though they hinted it could be a murder suicide

A neighbor, who refused to give her name, told the Times that the residents of the home were a 'perfect Christian family.'

She said her daughter was close friends with one of the family's children. 

One neighbor told the Orange County Register that she thought she hear a young girl crying inside the home early Tuesday morning.

'It was just awful crying,' neighbor Anila Whitney-Miller said. 

'That kind of screaming was so hard. Then it just stopped.'

Other neighbors described the family as friendly.

Every Christmas for the last five years, they have set out blow-up decoration on their front lawn.
