The flogging of a Saudi blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam has been postponed for the third week in a row, his wife said today.

Raef Badawi, 30, received the first 50 lashes of his sentence outside a mosque in the Red Sea city of Jeddah on January 9.

The next round was postponed for the following two weeks on medical grounds.

Now his wife Ensaf Haidar said he 'was not flogged' today either, adding that the reason was unclear.

Last week, Badawi's spokeswoman said there was a chance he could have his jail sentence reduced.

Dr Elham Manea, who is a professor at the University of Zurich, said the Saudi ambassador in Germany had told a broadcaster of the development.

In a posting on her Facebook page, she wrote: 'Saudi ambassador in Germany informed NDR-TV that flogging will not continue and #RaifBadawi maybe not (sic) have to serve the whole time in prison.' 

Her comments came just a day after the second round of the 31-year-old's flogging was postponed a second time due to medical concerns.

Only a few days ago Saudi Arabia was accused of 'outrageous inhumanity' after it initially delayed the father of three's flogging sentence so his wounds could heal before he was whipped again.

Saudi Arabia has come under huge international pressure after Mr Badawi's plight was championed by human rights campaigners. 

The 31-year-old won support from governments and human rights groups around the world after he was sentenced to the hefty jail time, a £177,000 fine and the lashes. 

Elham Manea's Facebook post claimed the flogging was to be stopped and his 10-year jail sentence reduced

Father of three Raif Badawi was facing 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks for 'insulting Islam'

His official crime was to insult Islam but supporters say his real offence was to criticise the country's powerful Sunni clerics on his blog. He faces 50 lashings every Friday for the next 18 weeks.

If it's true that his prison sentence has been reduced and flogging finished, it will be considered a small victory for his supporters after they made repeated calls for the 'torture' to be unconditionally stopped. 

Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone is believed to show the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi is hit on his legs and back by a policeman with a switch.

Mr Badawi's wife has fled to Canada with their children. She says he started a forum that was simply meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: 'Every lash killed me.'

UN officials say the flogging breaches international law as a 'cruel and unusual punishment' and the Foreign Office has said it would continue to raise the case.
