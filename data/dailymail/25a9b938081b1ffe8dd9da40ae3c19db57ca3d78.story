Children are so badly taught in religious education lessons that they don’t know why Jesus is a key figure in Christianity, the Government’s education watchdog has found.

Too many leave school with little idea of what Jesus did and what he stood for – or how Christianity and other religions have shaped the world, say Ofsted inspectors.

A damning report published today finds RE is weak in six in ten schools and pupils are given only a superficial knowledge of faith.

Inspectors said teachers lacked the confidence  and knowledge to  ‘stretch’ children.

The Church of England said the report ‘places the blame for poor standards squarely on Government policy – in particular the removal of support and the squeeze on places for training RE teachers is a scandal’.

The Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said: ‘There is a whole generation of children who have only a superficial knowledge of Christianity.’

The 48-page report, which was based on evidence from more than 200 schools, found low standards, weak teaching and poor leadership.

It said a key area of concern was that too many pupils were leaving school with ‘a very limited understanding’ of Christianity.

Michael Cladingbowl, Ofsted’s Director of Schools, said: ‘We found that children couldn’t  say why  Jesus was important.’
