Arrest: Traci L. Vaillancourt

A former model - who lost her looks and was left hooked on painkillers after getting a rare blood disease - is to be questioned by detectives after her boyfriend allegedly shot dead a police officer then tried to kill her and himself.

Traci Vaillancourt, 34, was allegedly shot in the back by her boyfriend Timothy 'Troy' Walker while sitting in their Volvo in Draper, Utah, just moments after he is accused of shooting dead Sgt Derek Johnson.

Walker then turned the weapon on himself and has been hospitalized alongside his long-term partner since. They are both in a critical condition.

Police are waiting to speak to 
Vaillancourt to hear her account of what happened and to find out if she
 knew about her boyfriend's intention to kill.

Officers suspect the pair were on drugs when Sgt Johnson spotted their car parked awkwardly.

Speaking in response to the crime, 
Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic 
demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman 
reliant on her violent boyfriend.

After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com.

She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30.

'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster.

'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.'

'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added.

King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior.

'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said.

The
 couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which 
wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister.

Detectives
 are now waiting at Intermountain Medical Center, where the couple are 
being treated to question them about the shooting. 

They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother.

Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction.

'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper.

According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'.

She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car.

She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 

'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview.

'I just want them to know I’m sorry'.

Walker has a history of petty crime but nothing that would indicate the murder he is accused of carrying out on Sunday.

Vaillancourt too has a record of theft and shoplifting but nothing violent.

Sgt Johnson, 32, a father-of-one will be buried on Friday.

'The streets of Draper City were made
 safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for 
the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his 
obituary.

'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32.'

He was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen.

'He
 was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, 
Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer
 of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up 
any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend.
 He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and
 giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads.

The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field.

The owner, Dan Smith, hung ribbons in his memory.

'There's
 no words that can explain it and make it ok,' Smith said. 'It obviously
 tugs at your heartstrings and you want to do something to show that it 
wasn't in vain.'

The local sheriff Jim Winder says Walker had a desire to shoot a uniformed officer.
