The nurse who successfully fought an Ebola quarantine order is planning to leave a Maine town with her boyfriend and move out of state.

Ted Wilbur says he and girlfriend Kaci Hickox will leave Fort Kent no earlier than Monday, the last day of the disease's 21-day incubation period.

Wilbur withdrew Friday from the University of Maine campus in Fort Kent, where he was a senior nursing student. Hickox said they were exploring the idea of relocating and looking at a new college — and noted that it would probably be outside Maine.

Ted Wilbur says he was barred from returning to his studies at the University of Maine at Fort Kent despite his girlfriend Kaci Hickox being declared 'not contagious' by state officials

'We're going to try to get our lives back on track,' Wilbur said Friday night to the Portland Press Herald. 

A state judge sided with Hickox when she challenged an order to isolate her after she returned from treating Ebola patients in West Africa.

The couple decided to leave after Hickox was told she could go where she pleased after a judge ruled in her favor in October, but her boyfriend was told to stay away from his studies.

Ted Wilbur withdrew Friday from the University of Maine at Fort Kent, said Ray Phinney, associate dean of student life and development. He declined further comment.

Leaving: Kaci Hickox and Ted Wilbur have announced that they will now leave their home in Maine and possibly the state after the Ebola quarantine controversy  

Wilbur says he was forced to stay away from campus while his girlfriend was in the news amid attempts to quarantine her after she returned from treating Ebola patient in West Africa.

But university officials contend he voluntarily agreed to stay off campus.

"I wish that his university had showed more leadership in all of this. I think they only fueled the flames of confusion and misinformation. That's been really disappointing for us," his girlfriend, Kaci Hickox, told The Associated Press.

Hickox contended there was no need to isolate her. A state judge sided with her, saying she poses no health threat because she's showing no symptoms.

On October 31 a Maine judge sided with her, rejecting the state's attempt to restrict her movement.

In October, the judge said there's no need to restrict her movements because she's not showing symptoms of Ebola. In his ruling, LaVerdiere thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and wrote that 'people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational'.

The state of Maine had gone to court to keep Hickox at home until her incubation period ended on November 10.

After the judge ruled against this, he thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and acknowledged the gravity of restricting someone's constitutional rights without solid science to back it up.

The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,' he wrote.

'The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational.'

Hickox, 33, stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey.

After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine.

She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease.
