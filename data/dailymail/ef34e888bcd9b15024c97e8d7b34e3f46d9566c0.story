Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has goaded his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino by claiming midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is glad he did not follow him to White Hart Lane.

The two teams meet in north London on Sunday and Koeman said: ‘It was very important Schneiderlin stayed. I think the player is very happy to stay.

‘Maybe he had some doubts about the club’s ambition but if you ask Morgan now about our ambition, it is what he would like to see. 

'He is a key player. He scores, he defends, he attacks and with that kind of player you like to do everything to keep him in the team.’

There is no doubt Schneiderlin was unsettled by Pochettino’s interest, even tweeting his concerns after Saints rejected Tottenham’s £12m bid in August.

Koeman, whose side are second in the table, added: ‘Tottenham never made a serious bid. A lot of players left the club and Schneiderlin maybe had some disappointing moments but I spoke to him. 

'We wanted to do everything to show our ambition and we showed him that with the signings we made.’
