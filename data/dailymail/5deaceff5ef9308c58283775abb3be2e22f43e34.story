Accused: Damian Rzeszowski visited a prostitute and had a one-night stand in the days before he killed six people, a court heard

A builder who knifed six people to death, including his wife and two young children, had visited a prostitute and had a one-night stand in the days before the killings, a court heard today.

Damian Rzeszowski's marriage was under great strain after his wife Izabela Rzeszowska admitted to having a two-month affair with another man, the Royal Court in St Helier, Jersey, was told.

The 31-year-old Polish defendant is accused of murdering Mrs Rzeszowska, 30, along with their daughter, Kinga, five, and two-year-old son, Kacper, in St Helier.

He is also alleged to have murdered his wife’s father, Marek Garstka, 56, her friend, Marta De La Haye, 34, and Mrs De La Haye’s five-year-old daughter, Julia De La Haye.

He has pleaded guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility, but the pleas were not accepted by the Crown.

Prosecutors argue that Rzeszowski was not suffering an 'abnormality of the mind' when the attacks took place, on August 14 last year.

Today the court heard that Rzeszowski and his family had returned from a holiday to Poland on the day of the killings.

Rzeszowski had a one-night stand and visited a prostitute during the trip to his country.

After returning from their trip, he got into a discussion with his wife for leaving the children on their own in the house.

But the prosecution say that, rather than flying into an instant rage, Rzeszowski waited an hour and three-quarters before butchering his family and their visitors.

The court heard he attacked his father-in-law first, catching him unawares while he watched Polish TV on his bed.

Victims: Damian Rzeszowski is alleged to have murdered his five-year-old daughter Kinga (right) and two-year-old son Kacper (left)

Siblings: Kinga (right) and Kacper Rzeszowski were killed by their father on August 14 last year

Family: The defendant, Damian Rzeszowski (right), pictured with his wife Izabela, daughter Kinga and son Kacper. He killed all three in a knife attack in August last year

Kacper was stabbed 13 times with two different kitchen knives while he played with his toys, and the two little girls were also stabbed numerous times.

Mrs De La Haye, who had gone to the house with her daughter for a barbecue, staggered out into the street and collapsed outside the flat.

Mrs Rzeszowska climbed through the bathroom window as she tried to escape her husband and made a 'desperate attempt' to call the police using her father’s mobile phone.

She dialled 997, the Polish emergency services number, before being chased out into the street and stabbed again in front of neighbours.

Rzeszowski then went back inside his home in Victoria Crescent and started stabbing himself before slumping to the ground with a collapsed lung.

The court was shown the two kitchen knives that Rzeszowski used during the attacks.

It also saw a painting that the children had been working on just before they were killed.

'Great strain': Damian Rzeszowski's marriage had been under pressure because his wife Izabela Rzeszowska (left) had admitted having an affair. Her father, Marek Garstka (right), was also killed

Stabbed: Mrs Rzeszowska's friend Marta De La Haye (left) and her daughter Julia (right) were the last two victims of the knife attack

Giving evidence today, consultant 
psychiatrist Dr Dale Harrison told the court that Rzeszowski was haunted
by voices in his head.

The
psychiatrist said that when he interviewed Rzeszowski five days after 
the attacks he found no definitive symptoms of psychosis.

But
after re-examining Rzeszowski when he returned to Jersey from being 
treated in Broadmoor Hospital, Dr Harrison said: 'For the last week he 
has continued to experience voices.

'These voices are related to stress he is under.

Scene: The knife attack happened in the St Helier flat Damian Rzeszowski shared with his family

'His stress levels are up since leaving Broadmoor Hospital and being put in prison.'

In
the first interview Dr Harrison conducted with Rzeszowski on August 19 
last year, the defendant said he could not remember what had happened.

Solicitor General Howard Sharp, for the prosecution, read from the notes the psychiatrist had written during the interview.

No escape: Julia De La Haye and her mother Marta were visiting the Rzeszowskis' home when the fatal attacks occurred. The girl was stabbed numerous times

He read: 'Damian said "I just remember the knife. I remember bits and pieces, going behind wife and running behind her".

'He stated he did not remember attacking the children. He did remember his father-in-law and later running behind his wife.'

At
another point in the interview, Rzeszowski told Dr Harrison: 'Everybody
gone, it is father-in-law, my wife, my wife’s friend and daughter. It 
is me, I did that.'

Rzeszowski also told the doctor that 
he had had no previous thoughts of killing his family or anyone else 
because he was not 'that type of man', although he later added: 'Maybe 
when I was drunk or upset.'

Yesterday,
the court heard that Rzeszowski claims to have blacked out after 
cooking sausages at a barbecue at his family’s home before the attacks 
took place.

He had drunk several glasses of whisky on the day of the attacks but was under the drink-drive limit.

Rzeszowski is currently taking anti-depressants and the anxiety-relieving drug Diazepam, the court was told.

Since the trial started he has seemed absent in the dock, staring at the floor at all times.
