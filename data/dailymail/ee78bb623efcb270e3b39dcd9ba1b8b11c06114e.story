Vladimir Putin is suffering from Asperger's Syndrome, a study by a Pentagon think-tank has claimed.

The study claimed the Russian President's 'neurological development was significantly interrupted in infancy,' resulting in his Asperger's diagnosis.

In order to come to the conclusion that Putin suffers from an autistic disorder, the think-tank cites work by autism specialists and movement pattern experts.

'Autistic': Russian President Vladimir Putin, pictured staring down Russian Foreign Minister Srgei Lavrov last week, has been 'diagnosed' with Asperger's Syndrome by a Pentagon think-tank

President Putin has 'an autistic disorder which affects all of his decisions,' Brenda Connors, an expert in movement-pattern analysis at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, wrote in the report obtained by USA Today. 

After studying Putin's movement in public settings, Connors concluded that 'the Russian President carries a neurological abnormality.'

Two studies on Putin, one in 2008 and another in 2011, were written for the Office of Net Assessment, an internal Pentagon think-tank on military strategy.

The study also quotes Dr. Stephen Porges,  Professor in psychiatry at University of North Carolina, as saying 'Putin carries a form of autism', but following the report in USA Today he told the website that he would not go as far as to say the Russian leader has Asperger's.

The results of the studies have been published as French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepare to join US Secretary of State John Kerry in Kiev  ahead of talks with Putin about the situation in Ukraine.

Warning: Speaking at a news conference in Paris this morning French President Hollande said 'diplomacy cannot go on forever' as world leaders prepare to meet Putin to discuss an end to war in the Ukraine

Not forever: Francois Hollande told journalists that while France and Berlin had chosen diplomacy rather than arming Kiev troops against the pro-Russian separatists, negotiations could not drag on indefinitely

Tomorrow, Merkel and Hollande will travel on to Moscow to meet with Putin in the hope of producing a conflict-resolution deal that would be acceptable to all parties,

Asperger's Syndrome is a life-long condition which falls within the autistic spectrum.

It affects about 1 in 200 people, more commonly in men than women, and sufferers experience difficulty in social interaction, social communication and imagination, and cognitive flexibility.

These are often displayed, predominantly in males, by a lack of empathy, impaired imagination, difficulty in making friends, intense absorption in a special interest.

Whilst people with Asperger's will exhibit some or all of these characteristics to a greater or lesser degree, many tend to experience isolation and a lack of understanding in their everyday lives, which often results in frustration, anger, depression and a lack of self-esteem.

The flurry of high-level diplomacy aimed to end the resurgent fighting in eastern Ukraine that is threatening European security. 

France and Germany hoped this time they could come up with a peace deal that both Ukraine and Russia could agree to.

Kerry is already visiting Kiev and in Brussels, NATO prepared to boost its forces today in response to Ukraine's unrest and Russia's increased military forcefulness.

Fighting between Russia-backed separatists and government forces picked up in January after a month of relative calm, with more than 220 civilians killed in the past three weeks alone, according to the United Nations.

The UN has sharply criticized both sides for indiscriminate shelling and called for a temporary truce.

Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that Putin, Merkel and Hollande will discuss 'what the three nations can do to help put a quick end to a civil war in southeastern Ukraine, which has exacerbated in recent days with mounting casualties.' 

The study has been criticised by autism organisation National Autistic Society (NAS), saying this kind of speculative diagnosis is 'fraught with risks and unhelpful'. 

'Autism is a complex condition and a diagnosis should only ever be made following a thorough, holistic face-to-face process involving both the individual and the diagnostician,' Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs and Social Change at NAS said.
