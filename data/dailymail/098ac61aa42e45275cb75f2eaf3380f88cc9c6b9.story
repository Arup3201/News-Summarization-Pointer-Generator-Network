Tesco staff banned a customer from paying his bill with commemorative £20 coins - and then called police when he didn't have any other cash.

Kitchen fitter Brett Chamberlain, 44, filled his car up with £87.49 worth of petrol at a Tesco store in Tiverton, Devon, and then produced five of the special edition £20 coins.

But Tesco garage staff refused to accept them, called police when he couldn't produce an alternative payment and then banned him from the premises.

Brett Chamberlain, 44, tried to use commemorative £20 coins to pay for his petrol at a Tesco store in Tiverton, Devon, but staff refused to accept them and called police when he couldn't provide another payment method

Barred: Mr Chamberlain was told he was banned from the petrol station after trying to pay with the £20 coins

Staff told Mr Chamberlain they had checked with the company's legal team and could not accept the coins in payment, reports the Mid Devon Gazette.

Afterwards, a sign was placed on fuel pumps, stating: 'We are no longer excepting (sic) commemorative coins, ie £20.00 coins.

'Please make sure you have significant funds to pay for your fuel. Sorry for any inconvenience.'

In the UK, a person cannot be sued for a debt if they have attempted to pay with legal tender.

In England and Wales, £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes are all legal tender for payment of any amount. This is not the case in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

But
 Royal Mint coins of any amount are legal tender throughout the UK, 
meaning a court would see them as an acceptable method of payment, 
although a shop doesn't have to accept them.

By law, a shop also doesn't have to accept payment in 1p or 2ps for anything over the value of 20p.

Launched by the Royal Mint last year, the £20 coins are described on its website as 'official, legal tender'.

Although by law, shops and banks do not have to accept large denomination coins, even if they are legal tender.

Brett, of Tiverton, said: 'I am not a confrontational person and don't want an argument with anyone.

'But I do feel that it is not right that Tesco should be telling us what coins we can or cannot use as long as they are legal tender.'

He kept the £20 coins in his car after ordering a number when they were released.

He admitted some people were confused as to why he insisted on using the largely-unknown form of currency, but didn't think he had inconvenienced anyone.

Three years ago he had another battle with staff at the same branch when he attempted to pay for fuel with small denomination coins he found with a metal detector.

The branch has since confirmed it will now accept the coins.

A spokesman said: 'There are so few £20 coins in circulation many of our colleagues are unfamiliar with them.

'We are letting them know they can accept the coins.'

The coins are only available online and just 250,000 were minted. They are intended to be a gift for collectors but are legal tender. At just over an inch wide, the coin is slightly larger than a £1 coin and is silver in colour.

Change of policy: Supermarket giant Tesco has now agreed that it can accept commemorative £20 coins after Mr Chamberlain complained
