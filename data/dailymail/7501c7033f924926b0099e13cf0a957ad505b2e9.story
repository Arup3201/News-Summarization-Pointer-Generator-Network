'Knife attack': Police said that Mary Galvis, pictured, lashed out at her young children with a knife this morning

A mother allegedly stabbed two of her own children in their home, leaving them with serious injuries.

Mary Glavis, 47, took a knife to her 8-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter in a frenzied attack in West Valley, Utah, police said.

Galvis lunged at her children several times, according to witness reports, and also lashed out at her teenage daughter, who received less serious wounds.

She was only stopped from her attack when the teen's screams woke the children's father, who was able to wrest the knife from her hands, the Desert NewsÂ reported.

A police spokesman said: 'The father heard the commotion and was able to prevent it from going any further.

'Investigators are still speaking to her and trying to find out what caused all this.'

Police were called to the scene after the teenage girl was able to raise the alarm - and were warned Galvis might be crazed.

The other two children were taken to hospital with multiple stab wounds. Their condition was said to be critical when they arrived, but has since stabilized.

Galvis was taken to the Salt Lake County Jail, where officers said she was co-operating with the investigation.
