Manchester United will again be without new defender Marcos Rojo on Saturday after a delay in the Argentinian getting a work permit.

By contrast, new £60m signing Angel di Maria is set to make his debut against Burnley  after Louis van Gaal revealed: 'I think he is ready to play.' 

A discrepancy with Rojo's passport means he has has to visit the Argentine embassy in Madrid before he gets clearance to play.

This in turn means United will have to visit Burnley without the £16million new signing, even though he signed for the club more than a week ago. 

On Friday afternoon manager Louis van Gaal said: 'It's only a matter of time. I'm manager of the biggest club in the world, but I can't change the law in Argentina!

'We have to obey the law.' 

Despite the fact United only have one point from two games and have crashed out of the Capital One Cup to MK Dons, Van Gaal thinks he will be successful at his new club.

'I never doubt myself,' he said. 'I'm sure I will have success here. 

'But I need time. We are building up a new team.'

Van Gaal takes his team to Turf Moor for Saturday's 12.45pm kick-off still looking for his first competitive win as United manager.

Burnley's form this season is just as bad as United's, following Premier League defeats by Chelsea and Swansea plus a cup exit against Sheffield Wednesday in midweek.

But the Dutchman does not expect an easy ride against the Clarets, who were promoted from the Championship last season. Burnley pulled off a huge shock the last time they hosted United in the Premier League, beating Sir Alex Ferguson's United 1-0 in a dramatic Lancashire derby in 2009.

'It will be a fantastic atmosphere,' said Van Gaal. 'They'll play with a lot of passion and long balls. We have to fight against that. 

'It shall be a very difficult game but we have to show we can play football.' 

Van Gaal also backed Wayne Rooney to be a success as England captain following his appointment by Roy Hogson this week as successor to Steven Gerrard. Rooney was also handed the armband by Van Gaal after his appointment in the summer.

'He'll cope with the responsibility,' said Van Gaal. 'I wouldn't have made him Manchester United captain otherwise.'
