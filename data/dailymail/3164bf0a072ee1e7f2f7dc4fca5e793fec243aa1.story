Diners are being asked to sign a waiver before eating a fiery chilli burger - after it put five people in hospital.

The XXX Hot Chilli Burger - dubbed the hottest dish in Britain - is served to over 18s only at Burger Off in Hove, Sussex. 

It is topped with chilli sauce worth a staggering 9.2million on the Scoville scale - a measure of the 'hotness' of foods.

Sauce: It is topped with chilli sauce worth a staggering 9.2million on the Scoville scale - a measure of the 'hotness' of foods. Above, restaurant owner Nick Gambardella, 55, spreads the fiery sauce onto the burger

Waiver: In contrast, the average chilli pepper is just 500 Scoville units. Now, Mr Gambardella is asking diners to sign a legal disclaimer (right) that prevents them from suing him if they fall victim to the red-hot chilli burger

In contrast, the average chilli pepper comes in at just 500 Scoville Heat Units.

One diner 
was taken to hospital with a suspected perforated bowel after eating the spicy dish, while four others were admitted for treatment on the same night for 
suspected anaphylactic shock.

Now, restaurant owner Nick Gambardella is asking customers to sign a legal disclaimer that prevents them from suing him if they fall victim to the red-hot burger.

Developed by American pharmacist Wilbuer Scoville in 1912, the Scoville scale is a measure of the amount of capsaicin in chilli peppers.

It can also be used to measure the 'hotness' of anything derived from chilli peppers, such as spicy sauces.

Capsaicin is the chemical compound that produces the sensation of heat in the mouth.

The amount present is measured in Scoville Heat Units - with the average chilli pepper measuring 500 units.

The document reads: 'I the undersigned accept all responsibility for any effects incured (sic) due to the consumtion (sic) of the above mentioned XXX Hot Chilli Burger and release Burger Off, its owner and staff from any liability.'

Mr Gambardella, 55, said he was 'amazed' that he was allowed to sell such a spicy burger - adding: 'It has been a massive hit with the customers'.

'I have to admit I’ve not dared to try 
one of these burgers myself as they are so spicy,' he said.

'One guy came in and he was just a 
little bit cocky and when he left he was admitted to hospital because 
prior to eating the burger he had a stomach ulcer and we believe it 
perforated his bowel. He wasn’t in a good way but he pulled through.

'I’ve also heard the local hospital had people on crash
 mats on adrenalin drips from my burger. But we never call an ambulance, it is always the customer who calls.'

He added: 'I have spoken to people at environmental health but they think it is hilarious.

Effect: One customer was taken to hospital with a suspected perforated bowel after eating the spicy dish, while four other diners were admitted for treatment on the same night for suspected anaphylactic shock

Preparation: Mr Gambardella said he was 'amazed' he was allowed to sell such a spicy burger (left and right)

'Trading Standards came in and I tried to convince the guy to have one but he wouldn’t have it.'

The burger, which is on sale for only £3.90, features sauce based on a
 Piri Piri chilli concentrate, created through steaming and later 
infused with carbon dioxide.

So far, only 59 out of 3,000 challengers have succeeded in eating the entire dish.

Mr
 Gambardella said the burger had caused customers to adopt a number of 
undignified coping mechanisms, including stripping naked, begging for 
mercy, punching windows and vomiting.

Disclaimer: The waiver prevents diners from suing the restaurant if they fall victim to the red-hot burger

It
 has also left many diners suffering from anaphylactic shock - a severe 
allergic reaction that can cause swelling, rashes and difficulty 
breathing.

'The burgers are cooked properly - it’s the sauce that is maybe too hot to handle,' said Mr Gambardella.

'One of my customers works at the local hospital and they came down to tell me that staff held a two hour meeting about my chilli burger and that they are changing how they treat ‘the fallen’.

'They’ve now decided that an adrenalin drip is more effective for dealing with the anaphylactic shock that the burger sometimes brings on.

On sale: The burger has left many diners suffering from anaphylactic shock - a severe allergic reaction that can cause swelling, rashes and difficulty breathing. Above, the dish is advertised as being for 'over 18s only'

'Why the customers eat it I don’t know, because I always say to them that it is incredibly hot and give them all the health warnings under the sun.

'I think these people are slightly mad to eat it but I’m sure there is a certain level of peer pressure. A lot of people just regard it as a challenge.'

Failed attempt: Former Big Brother star Pete Bennett attempted the challenge - but ended up writhing on the pavement

He added: 'Obviously I always take my responsibilities as a food retailer seriously but if my customers want super spicy food, I am entitled to give them what they want.'

Customers willing to try the XXX Hot 
Chilli Burger vary from young men to parents - while Burger Off also offers a cocktail 
stick sample for more timid customers.

Mr Gambardella said: 'People always ask where I get the sauce from but I always say "If I tell you I will have to kill you". I just got fed up with people saying "well it’s not really that hot", so I thought, "well let’s make it hotter".

'Now it’s got a bit of a following from people travelling for miles to challenge a friend or themselves.'

Many of the burger's conquerors have taken to Twitter and The Burger Off Facebook page to spread the word of their victory.

Facebook user Douglas Hogarth said: 'My brother had heard all these bold statements beforehand about how he went to Dubai and Delhi and demanded their hottest possible curry and it barely made him break a sweat.

'He got two bites into The XXX and gave up. Then spent two days recovering'

And another user wrote 'Sadly I can confirm that this Burger is no joke.'

Even former Big Brother star Pete Bennett attempted the challenge - only to end up writhing on the pavement.
