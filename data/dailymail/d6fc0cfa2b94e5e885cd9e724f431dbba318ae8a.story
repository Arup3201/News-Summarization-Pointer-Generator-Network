This is the dramatic moment marine experts battled to save a huge pod of whales which they fear could beach themselves off the Essex coast.

More than 30 pilot whales were seen in the waters near between Jaywick and Brightling Sea yesterday and had to be led to safety by marine experts.

They were first spotted last weekend off the Norfolk and Suffolk coast and police have warned the public to keep their distance from the mammals.

The British Divers Marine Life Rescue teamed up with Essex Police’s marine unit in an attempt to lead the whales to deeper waters.

Stacey Belbin, 26, who has run boat trips in the area for three years, went out to sea with her brother-in-law to see the whales.

She said: ‘Me and my brother-in-law have been here watching them since yesterday. 

'We were told that there were loads of whales just off the coast so we had to go out and have a look for ourselves.

‘We went out on a 16ft boat and they came to just a feet away from us - it really was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

'There must have been around 30 whales - it was absolutely magical.

‘I’ve been running boat tours here for around three years and I’ve not seen anything like this - it’s been fantastic.’

Diving teams are still working tirelessly to lead the whales to safety after they were first spotted near the UK last week.

It comes after two whales were beached at St Lawrence Bay in the River Blackwater, near Braintree, Essex.

Pilot whales can grow to more than 20ft long and are usually seen around the coast off South America and Australia.
