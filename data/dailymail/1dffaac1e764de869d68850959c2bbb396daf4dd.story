Retired Army Sergeant Noah Galloway, 33, of Alabaster, will be the first reader to ever appear on the cover of Men's Health magazine

An Alabama war veteran and double amputee is making Men's Health history as the first reader to appear on the magazine's cover, Men's Health announced Tuesday 

Retired Army Sergeant Noah Galloway, 33, of Alabaster, will be the first reader to ever appear on the cover of Men's Health magazine after winning the publication's first 'Ultimate Men's Health Guy' contest.   Guy' contest.  

Galloway beat out more than 1,200 men in the magazine's search for 'a guy who personified the spirit of Men's Health,' according to Men's Health magazine.

When Galloway was named one of the contest's three finalists, he told Men's Health that, if he won the contest thus appearing on the cover, he hoped it wouldn't be because he was injured. 

'To me, they're putting a reader on the cover, so it's more of the average man, Galloway said. 'He's not going to be bigger than life. Men's Health sees that man as relatable.

"To feel like I'm relatable to all the readers—that's some big compliment."

Earning his title as the 'Ultimate Men's Health Guy,' Galloway has had to overcome ultimate hardships.

The father-of-three was serving as an infantry soldier in Iraq Dec. 19, 2005 when his humvee set off an IED in Yusafiah, Iraq resulting in the loss of his left forearm and left leg below the knee as well as several injuries to his remaining leg and jaw, according to the Noah Galloway website.

After the injury, Galloway went into a deep depression, he told Men's Health. Galloway said he would sit at home drinking, smoking, and sleeping all day. 

'I thought, more than a few times, that it would've been better if I had just died,' Galloway said in a Men's Health interview. 'I'd have been looked at like a hero, but instead, I had two of my limbs taken from me.'

In 2010, facing physical devastation and depression, Galloway decided to end his pity party and make a change.

He joined a 24-hour gym and slowly regained his confidence, leaving his depression behind.

Children: Galloway told Men's Health that his depression affected his relationship with his children

Triumph: Galloway overcame his depression and became a runner and personal trainer participating in many marathons and events

He went on to participate in many events such as: the 2012 Marine Corps Marathon, Three Warrior Dash events, seven Tough Mudder events, a Barbarian Challenge, six Spartan events, the Spartan Death Race (which he completed), the Bataan Death March Marathon, three Crossfit competitions, and several 5K and 10K races. He is also a member of Operation Enduring Warrior -- a non-profit veteran support group. 

And now, to his list of accomplishments, he can add being on the cover of the world's largest men's magazine. Men's Health has a global readership of more than 35 million, according to Rodale. 

Fund: His triumphs led him to creating the 'No Excuses Charitable Fund' -- a donation-based fund aiming to provide assistance to local organizations focused on reducing childhood obesity in Alabama

'I do know the difference of going from living a life of being miserable and out of shape and how that can turn around completely just by being healthier,' Galloway said in the Men's Health interview.

'Being a personal trainer and being injured,' Galloway continued, 'I take people's excuses away. Whatever it is that you tell me that you can't do, I'm like we can find something to get it done.' 

His recovery and triumphs led him to creating the 'No Excuses Charitable Fund' --  a donation-based fund aiming to provide assistance to local organizations focused on reducing childhood obesity in Alabama.
