A potent winter storm that buried much of the Great Plains and left at least three people dead moved into Chicago on Tuesday, forcing hundreds of flight cancellations and raising the prospect of a nightmarish evening commute.

The National Weather Service's Chicago office issued a winter weather advisory from noon through 9pm (CET).

Forecasters predicted the storm, which packs a dangerous mix of wet snow, sleet, rain and high winds, would reach peak intensity around the evening rush hour, reducing visibility and creating treacherous driving conditions.

Up to 10inches of snow fell in parts of 
New Mexico and the foothills west of Denver saw up to two feet of snow. 

The moisture allowed the U.S. Forest Service to burn brush in northern 
Colorado to try to prevent future wildfires.

The Illinois Tollway agency, which maintains nearly 300 miles of highway around Chicago, said it was mobilizing its fleet of more than 180 snowplows in anticipation of the storm, which was expected to dump as much as 6 inches of wet snow north of the city.

At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, sleet and low clouds on the front end of the storm were causing delays of nearly two-and-a-half hours, according to Flightaware.com, and nearly 300 arrivals and departures were canceled at O'Hare and Chicago's Midway Airport.

In Oklahoma, Texas and parts of Kansas, where some residents were still digging out from a winter storm last week, the storm dumped up to 17 inches of snow on Amarillo, Texas, and whipped Kansas City, Missouri, with winds of up to 30 miles per hour.

Highways in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and parts of Kansas remained closed because of heavy and drifting snow.

Forecasters with the National Weather 
Service said the storm would dump 3 to 5 inches of wet snow on Detroit 
overnight and into Wednesday morning.

The storm has contributed to at least three deaths, two in Kansas and one in Oklahoma.

A woman died and three passengers were injured on Monday night on Interstate 70 when their pickup truck rolled off the icy roadway in Ellis County, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback said.

Earlier Monday, a man was killed when his car veered off the interstate in Sherman County near the Colorado border, he said.

'We urge everyone to avoid travel and be extremely cautious if you must be on the roads,' said Ernest Garcia, superintendent of the Kansas Highway Patrol.

In northern Oklahoma, one person died when the roof of a home partially collapsed in the city of Woodward, said Matt Lehenbauer, the city's emergency management director.

'We have roofs collapsing all over town,' said Woodward Mayor Roscoe Hill Jr. 'We really have a mess on our hands.'

Kansas
 City was also hard hit by the storm, which dumped as much as 13 inches 
of snow on some parts of the metro region on Tuesday, said Chris Bowman,
 meteorologist for the National Weather Service.

Bowman
 said another 1 to 3 inches could fall on Tuesday evening and nearly 
two-thirds of the flights at Kansas City International Airport Tuesday 
afternoon were canceled.

The
 storm cut power to some 80,000 households in the Kansas City 
metropolitan area and to more than 12,000 rural customers, officials 
said.

About half the Kansas City customers had power restored by noon 
Tuesday, said a spokeswoman for Kansas City Power & Light.

Heavy
 wet snow weighed down power lines and tree branches, making them 
vulnerable to collapse, especially with winds of 10 to 20 mph, said 
Sharon Watson, spokesperson for emergency management in Kansas.

Watson said this week's storm has in ways had a greater impact than last week's.

'It has covered far less of an area but it has been more deadly and there is the big concern about power outages,' Watson said.

Governors
 in Texas and Oklahoma had declared states of emergency in the areas 
struck by the snowstorm to speed assistance to those in need. Interstate
 and other highways were closed across the Texas and Oklahoma 
panhandles.

Areas around 
Amarillo and Lubbock received more than a foot of snow during the storm,
 which had cut visibility to near zero on some roads, Texas 
transportation officials said.

In
 addition to the winter storm, National Weather Service forecasters on 
Tuesday issued tornado watches across central Florida and up the eastern
 coast to South Carolina.

Forecasters have said the winter storm could be the worst in the Midwest since the Groundhog Day blizzard that started February 1, 2011

Blizzard warnings were in effect for 
the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, as well as southern Kansas through 
early on Tuesday morning, while Arkansas and Louisiana saw watches and 
warnings for severe thunderstorm and tornadoes.

The storm is forecast to track north 
and east, prompting winter storm warnings for southern and eastern 
Kansas and the upper half of Missouri.

A
 strong low-pressure system is feeding the wintry beast, Greg Carbin, a 
meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said.

'The
 more intense the low, the stronger the storm as far as pulling air in,'
 he said, noting that intense winter storms are common in the Plains 
during late February and March.

Up to 10inches of snow fell in parts of 
New Mexico and the foothills west of Denver saw up to two feet of snow. 
 The moisture allowed the U.S. Forest Service to burn brush in northern 
Colorado to try to prevent future wildfires.
