Stunning footage of a BBC presenter being attacked by a polar bear while in a cage enthralled Britain when it was aired in January.

But the Norwegian authorities were less pleased with the stunt - the programme's producer has been fined nearly £6,000 for 'disturbing' the bear.

Gordon Buchanan, host of Springwatch, climbed into a clear perspex box known as the 'ice cube' while filming a documentary in Svalbard, a group of Norwegian islands in the Arctic Circle.

He then proceeded to film as a 7ft polar bear tried to pry the box open and attack him, throwing its huge bulk at the structure and fearsomely growling.

Thrilling footage: But Gordon Buchanan's documentary has led to a fine for its producer

Attack: The filmmakers were accused of 'disturbing' the polar bears' natural environment in Svalbard

The footage was broadcast in a BBC Two programme entitled The Polar Bear Family and Me in January.

But now the vice-governor of Svalbard has written to Jason Roberts, a producer of the documentary, criticising him for breaking local environmental laws.

Lars Erik Alfheim warned the filmmaker he faced a fine of 50,000 kroner (£5,800) for intentionally approaching the polar bear and disturbing it in its natural habitat.

'By luring the polar bear to the cage it is disturbing it,' he wrote, according to the Sun.

'If the polar bear had managed to get into the cage it would have been in immediate danger of being shot by the surrounding production team before it managed to injure the TV host.'

Danger: But a local politician says it was the animal which was put at risk by the filming

Denial: The producer and presenter insist they obeyed all the relevant laws during filming

Polar bears are the main tourist attraction in the remote region, but strict rules are intended to protect both the animals and the humans who go seeking them.

In 2011, Eton schoolboy Horatio Chapple was killed by a bear on Svalbard after camping out in the wilderness with other British tourists.

Mr Roberts, an Australian who has been filming polar bears for more than two decades, denies any wrongdoing.

'In 22 years of filming bears I've never had any need to shoot a bear or use equipment to frighten one away,' he said.

'The vice-governor is making an example of me.'

Tenacious: The 7ft bear repeatedly tried to break in to the perspex box known as the 'ice cube'

He added that polar bears are naturally 'curious' and there was therefore nothing unusual about the animal approaching the cage.

Mr Buchanan also ridiculed Mr Alfheim's claims, telling the Sun: 'There are no grounds for any kind of prosecution. It is local politics.'

A spokesman for the BBC said the Corporation was aware of the politican's allegations but declined to comment.
