We're used to seeing Burnley in claret and blue, but the visitors wore a silver strip last night that made it look as though they had been wrapped in tin foil.

The club’s third kit was first seen at Sunderland late last month and was preferred to their all-black away kit again.

At first glance, it looked like Sean Dyche had fielded a team of 11 tin men from the Wizard of Oz, but Burnley's performance soon showed they were not lacking any heart as they gave the home side more than a few scares at Old Trafford.

Don't expect Louis van Gaal's team to respond by releasing their own tin coloured  kit any time soon though.

Manchester United are unlikely to ever play in the colour again after Sir Alex Ferguson binned it at half-time during a defeat at Southampton in 1996. 

United's technical area has been vacant for much of the season with Louis van Gaal happy to observe proceedings from the dugout and make notes on his clipboard, unlike his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson who used it to great effect as a means of berating match officials and scaring the wits out of his players.

Van Gaal’s assistant Ryan Giggs assumed a significantly higher profile last night, however, as he spent large parts of the game stood alongside Dyche on the touchline.

There was little sympathy for former Blackburn player Phil Jones from the Burnley fans as he limped off in the fifth minute. ‘You’ll always be a b*****d’ was the charming refrain from the away end of Old Trafford in reference to their East Lancashire rivalry.

The chant was drowned out when Jones’s replacement Chris Smalling scored with his first touch from a corner having been on the pitch for just 22 seconds, and he went on to head United in front again at the end of the first half.

Sean Dyche included three former United players in his team – David Jones, Michael Keane and Tom Heaton – but a serious knee injury suffered by Dean Marney last weekend meant that the Burnley boss was unable to name the same starting line-up for the 11th league game in a row.

Daley Blind was the second United player to be substituted before half-time after suffering a cut over his left eye in a collision with team-mate Jonny Evans. The Dutchman came back on after having stitches but couldn’t continue.

Talk of Manchester United turning into a long-ball team had dominated the build-up to this game thanks to some mischievous comments from Sam Allardyce and the reaction of Louis van Gaal who turned up at his pre-match press conference armed with statistical evidence to the contrary.

Marouane Fellaini was not called upon at Old Trafford following his central showing at West Ham on Sunday

The target man at the centre of it all, 6ft 4in Marouane Fellaini, doesn’t seem to mind either way. ‘I’m a midfielder and I like to play a bit more defensive, but it’s up to the manager,’ said Fellani. ‘Wherever he tells me to play, that’s where I play. If you put me up front you know why you’re doing it.’
