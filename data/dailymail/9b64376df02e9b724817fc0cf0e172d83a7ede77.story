A New York police union has told Bill de Blasio to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty.

The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association posted a form on its website that members could download and sign, barring the mayor and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito from their service. 

It simply reads: 'As a New York City police officer, (I) request that Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito refrain from attending my funeral services.'

The letter then goes on to state that their 'consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve' would mean their attendance is an 'insult'. 

The mayor and the speaker released a joint statement condemning the move.

According to the Daily News, the pair said: This is deeply disappointing. Incendiary rhetoric like this serves only to divide the city, and New Yorkers reject these tactics.

'The mayor and the speaker both know better than to think this inappropriate stunt represents the views of the majority of police officers and their families.'

PBA head Pat Lynch offered no comment Friday after the letter appeared. 

'I don’t think that’s right' one officer told the Daily News. 'They shouldn’t be doing that ... Politics is politics, but that sounds a little personal.

Last week, following days of protests in New York as a result of the grand jury decisions not to indict cops involved in the killing of Mike Brown or Eric Garner, the mayor caused anger among officers  when he said his son, Dante, should be wary when dealing with the police 

He added: 'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country.' During an interview with ABC he said that the United States was confronting 'centuries of racism'.

The letter would then be sent to the organization who would make the arrangements 

He added: 'We have to have an honest conversation in this country about a history of racism, we have to have an honest conversation about the problems that have caused parents to feel that their children may be in danger in their dynamics with police, when in fact police are there to protect them.

'Our police keep us safe, and yet there's been not just decades of problems, a history of centuries of racism that undergird this reality.'

De Blasio, who is white and married to a black woman with whom he has mixed-race children, added: 'We have to retrain police forces in how to work with communities differently, we have to work on things like body cameras that will provide a different level of transparency and accountability.

'This is something systemic and we bluntly have to talk about the historical racial dynamics underlying (it).'

Pat Lynch (center), the head of the PBA, did not comment on the letter that emerged on Friday. Many were torn was to what they thought of the move

Speaking from personal experience, de Blasio told ABC that he feared for his son's safety in dealing with the police.

'What parents have done for decades with children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful, when they have a connection with a police officer, when they have an encounter with a police officer,' he said.

'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country.

'And with Dante, very early on, my son, we used to say, look, if a police officer stops you, do everything he tells you to do, don't move suddenly, don't reach for your cellphone, because we knew, sadly, there is a greater chance it might be misinterpreted if it was a young man of color.'

He continued: 'There's that fear that there could be that moment of misunderstanding with a young man of color, and that young man may never come back.'
