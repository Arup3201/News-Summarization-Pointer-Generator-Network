The Premier League are exploring the possibility of introducing the vanishing spray that was implemented at the World Cup to much success.

Head of officiating in England Mike Riley, who attended Brazil 2014, has been asked for a report on the spray’s suitability to the top-flight.

It was seen as a positive addition to matches at the World Cup, used by referees to draw lines for defensive walls to stop encroachment as well as around the dead ball to prevent attackers moving it nearer goal.

For the time being nothing has been ruled out or in by those in charge at the Premier League, who still need to establish what domestic referees think, whether there is a desperate need, and how much time it may add to the game.

Even if reports are favourable, it is unlikely the spray will be used next season.

Meanwhile, Heine Allemagne, 43, the man who invented the, is set to reap the financial rewards after years in poverty and facing bankruptcy.

Heine told the Mirror that seeing the spray being
 used for the first time at the World Cup was a 'magical moment' and 
added: 'I dedicated 14 years of my life to this idea.

'After the referee brought it out the first time I started receiving text messages from my family and friends.

'It was the first time I got emotional, my eyes welled up. I remember thinking, ''I’m not crazy. It was all worth it".'

Allemagne
 grew up as one of five children living in a crowded three-bedroom house
 in Ituiutaba, a small town between Sao Paulo and Brasilia.

In the air: The Premier League is expected to discuss with clubs whether to use it

In action: The spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward

'We
 all slept together in one small room. I never had any toys and we had 
few clothes. My parents sent me out to work at the age of eight.' he 
said.

But now, Allemagne acknowledges he is set to make a lot of money if his product is adopted globally.

'I
 hope that whatever financial gain is comparable to my 14 years of 
struggle. I’ve paid a high price. I chose not to see my children grow up
 so that I could make this work.'

He
 continued: 'Most of all, though, I hope to have contributed to football
 – that we now have a tool that will help referees to keep order, help 
free kick takers score more goals, and improve the experience of 
football for everyone.'
