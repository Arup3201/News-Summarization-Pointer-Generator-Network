England’s quest for the dynamism that just might take them far in the World Cup began in the best possible way when they amassed the kind of batting riches they will desperately need when the serious business begins in Australia.

Five players hit 50s and Chris Woakes contributed an unbeaten 45 as England smashed 364 for six in their tour opener before wrapping up an emphatic 216-run victory against an Australian Capital Territories XI.

It was a satisfying start to a tough assignment for England but it should be pointed out they could not have begun against more accommodating opposition.

Fellow England opener Moeen Ali struck 50 - one of five England batsmen to hit a half-century 

Ali was out stumped by Andrew Harriott of the ACT XI after hitting his 50 off just 38 balls

The hosts boasted just one full-time professional supplemented by a motley collection of part-timers that included four students, a teacher, a Sydney financier and a bricklayer of Macedonian origin in Vele Dukoski.

Still, England will be encouraged that so many of their probable World Cup top six hit the ground running in this first of two warm-up games at the Manuka Oval before their tri-series against Australia and India begins on Friday.

The bad news is that new captain Eoin Morgan again looked out of touch while Ian Bell was unconvincing on his return to the opener’s role in place of the jettisoned Alastair Cook - even though he was one of the half-centurions.

England will prefer to reflect on how Moeen Ali, at the beginning, and Ravi Bopara, at the end, gave their innings a big-hitting flourish while James Taylor impressed again and Joe Root emphasised once more his increasing importance.

Moeen, in particular, provides hope for an England side that could not be going into the premier one-day tournament with expectations any lower.

The man who proved an all-round success in his first summer of Test cricket has taken to his new role as one-day opener like a duck to water and here he hit two sixes and seven fours in a 38-ball 50 in a partnership of 75 with Bell.

It is Bell who looks almost certain to line-up alongside Moeen in next month’s World Cup ahead of the more expansive Alex Hales but he will need to do more, starting against the Prime Minister’s XI on Wednesday, to justify England’s faith.

Here he was dropped in the first over immediately after hitting his first boundary and Bell then took another 14 overs before adding his second and final four in an innings ended, sadly predictably, when he holed out to mid-on.

Morgan is more of a worry because he is such a key figure for an England side who hope his elevation to the captaincy will have the same galvanising effect evident in his previous leadership excursions.

He did hit four fours here but could only manage 32 from 37 balls while all around him cashed in on below par bowling that had only the impressive left-arm spin of teacher Shane Devoy to commend it.

At least Morgan’s departure cleared the way for the best hitting of the game, Bopara and Woakes adding 105 off 50 balls as England at last managed to add three figures from the last 10 overs of a 50-over innings.

Bopara smashed five sixes in his unbeaten 56 from 27 balls while Woakes added three of his own in the 27 balls he faced.

It was always likely to be far too many for ACT and their thankless task was made virtually impossible when James Tredwell took three wickets in his first two overs without conceding a run.

There was also an encouraging return after injury for Stuart Broad while Jimmy Anderson looked short of fitness on his own return to the side and may need to do more against a strong looking Prime Minister’s side if he is play against Australia in Sydney on Friday.

Not that England needed to exert themselves to dismiss the hosts for 148 within 33 overs to complete a good day’s work. They know, though, that it is going to get a lot harder than this.
