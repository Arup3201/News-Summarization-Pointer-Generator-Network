TV appearance: Transsexual Chelsea Attonley shared her story on today's This Morning

Idol: The 27-year-old said Katie Price gave her the push she needed to have a sex change after the pair met in a nightclub when Chelsea was still a man called Matthew who liked to dress as a drag queen

'It all started when I was very young. I liked dressing up, at nursery I would head straight to the dressing up box and put on hats and wigs - that just felt right to me,' she explained. 'I didn't fit in at all as a teen. I felt more like one of the girls and all my friends were girls. I wasn't comfortable with my body.

'I didn't really know what was going on but I put myself in a box as gay and I didn't know about being transgender.'

By the time she was old enough to hit the clubs, Chelsea, still then Matthew, enjoyed dressing up and often went out as a drag queen called Miss Malibu.

Growing pains: Chelsea told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she had always struggled with her identity as a child and teenager

She admitted she 'felt great' and had fun whilst in her Miss Malibu persona but still struggled at home as 'gender dysphoria thoughts would be running through my head all the time.'

Then one night at a club, she had a chance meeting with one of her idols that would change the course of her life forever.

'I was at a club dressed as Miss Malibu and Peter Andre was doing an appearance,' she recalled.

'He was still with Katie Price then and we managed to get back stage to meet them and the first thing she said to me was "are they real?" about my breasts.'

Katie told me: "You've got to go for it"

'I couldn't believe she thought I'd already had surgery,' she added.

The pair got to chatting and Katie told Chelsea, 'you've got to go for it', when she mentioned her thoughts on having a sex change. 

Katie's words of encouragement gave her the push she needed to finally become the person she always felt she was inside.

After talking it over with her doctor, she then had the difficult task of explaining her choice to her family.

She said: 'I saw my GP and he said, "if you go home and tell your mum how you feel then I'll refer you".

'So I did. My dad died when I was 13 so had never really known about how I had been feeling, but I'll never forget telling my mum.

Worth it: After having gender reassignment surgery, she is finally happy with who she is

'She was watching Emmerdale and I walked in and said: "Mother, I'm going to become a woman!"

'And she just turned around and said "about time duck!"

Chelsea said she has no regrets about the lengthy gender change operation, which involves in depth counseling beforehand, as she is now much more confident and comfortable with who she is. Her only wish is that she'd 'done it a lot earlier.'

'I do sometimes think of Matthew - you go through a little grieving period'

'I am really happy now,' she beamed. 'I have met all the goals I wanted to in my life and I now just want to move on and become a successful woman. When I look in the mirror it is like looking at a completely different person.'

She added: 'I do sometimes think of Matthew - you go through a little grieving period.'

Now Chelsea, who says she is a trans entertainer, model and writer on her Facebook page, has dreams of hitting the stage.

'I've always wanted to be on the stage and I'd like to just represent women and transgender people,' she said.

Following her appearance on the ITV show, she received overwhelmingly positive support from This Morning veiwers who emailed and Tweeted to say she was an inspiration.
