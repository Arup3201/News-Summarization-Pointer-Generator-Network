Wayne Rooney was presented with the ‘golden cap’ by fellow England centurion Sir Bobby Charlton at Wembley in front of 80,000 fans on Saturday.

With England’s Under-21s side looking impressive in their 3-1 victory over Portugal on Thursday, Sportsmail looks at four players who could follow in Rooney’s footsteps.

Saido Berahino

Called up by Roy Hodgson for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and friendly against Scotland. 

Saido Berahino is set to win his first cap next week, but can he emulate the likes of Wayne Rooney?

Berahino has been impressive at youth level, and could become the first refugee to play for England

He has scored seven goals in the Premier League for West Bromwich Albion this season, only Alexis Sanchez (8), Diego Costa (10) and Sergio Aguero (12) have scored more. 

The 21 year-old is also the top-scorer in the Under-21 2015 UEFA Championship qualifying campaign with eight goals.

The West Brom academy graduate initially struggled going out on loan to Northampton Town, Brentford and Peterborough United, but since returning to the Black Country the energetic striker has found his feet in the Premier League. 

The West Brom striker has scored seven times already this season, including against Manchester United

After reported interest from Liverpool West Brom decided to open fresh contract talks with the much sought-after youngster. He only signed a new four-year extension with the club in December 2013.

Likely to make his international debut on Tuesday against Scotland at Celtic Park.

Harry Kane

Tottenham Hotspurs' most impressive player in a so-far disappointing transition under Mauricio Pochettino. Despite being the joint-top scorer in this season’s Europa League with five goals he has only started one game in the league to the annoyance and bemusement of many of Spurs' fans.

Harry Kane has scored six times for the U-21s, and Roy Hodgson has hinted at a full cap not being far away

Kane has been a bright spot during a disappointing start to this season at White Hart Lane

The North London club have lost four out of five home games this season, while Kane has warmed the bench, but his performances in Europe have given the indication that he could be the man to provide the lethal touch that Pochettino and the club badly need.

A product of the Spurs’s academy Kane has represented England at every youth level, scoring 6 goals in 9 appearances for the Under-21s, but is yet to make an appearance for the senior side.

Danny Ings

Scored 21 goals in the Championship last season as part of Burnley’s promotion to the Premier League subsequently winning 2013-14 Championship Player of the Year. 

Has scored just once in the Premier League this season, but netted twice in England’s Under-21’s 3-1 win over Portugal on Thursday evening at his home-ground Turf Moor.

Danny Ings' form in the last season attracted attention, and he has shown international potential

The 22 year-old former Bournemouth man has four goals in six Under-21 appearances, mainly down to his physical presence in and around the box. 

Burnley’s next three games against Stoke, Aston Villa and Newcastle could see him improve his top-flight tally.

Patrick Bamford

Chelsea’s exciting young prospect has experienced Football League environments for the last three seasons playing on-loan at MK Dons, Derby County and this season for Middlesbrough.

Played once for the Republic of Ireland Under-18s, before switching allegiance to play for England. Since 2010 he has playing for the Under-18s, 19s and 21s, making his Under-21 debut in November 2013 as a substitute against San Marino.

Patrick Bamford is exceptionally highly thought of at Chelsea, and could be an England star of the future

Bamford once represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level, but is now fully committed to England

In his spells at Derby and now Middlesbrough the young Chelsea striker has shown a killer instinct

Considered by some of Chelsea’s coaching staff to be the next thing, he has certainly impressed with his consistent performances and goalscoring in the Championship and League One.
