Pizza has long been the staple of a footballer's post match buffet as Cesc Fabregas and Sir Alex Ferguson famously brought to everyone's attention in 2004, and it seems Barcelona are no different in their choice of refuelling foods.

The post-match meal preferences of Luis Enrique's players have been revealed by Spanish newspaper Libertad Digital who were leaked a copy of the club's menu sheet before their game against Malaga.

Players make their preferences at the start of the season so even those not directly involved on Wednesday night, in the 0-0 draw on the Costa del Sol, appear on the list.

Bravo, Douglas (Adriano 73), Bartra, Pique, Alba, Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta, Pedro (Sandro 64), Messi, Neymar (Munir 64).

Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Xavi, Mascherano, Roberto.

German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen makes the most exotic choice requesting 'Sushi and a chocolate spread sandwich'. Most of the rest of the squad opt for a pizza, energy drink combination but there are other notable exceptions.

Lionel Messi opts for Sprite to wash down his cheese pizza while Sergio Busquets asks for fruit with his York Ham pizza but insists on it being 'only pineapple or strawberries'.

Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo and Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic take perhaps the healthiest options with pasta and fruit, and sushi and fruit respectively.

Andres Iniesta and Jordi Alba leave the pitch with the biggest appetites. The midfielder requests a 'ham and cheese pizza' and a 'chorizo sausage sandwich' while the full back also tucks into a ham and cheese pizza accompanied by a turkey and cheese sandwich.

New signing Thomas Vermaelen, meanwhile, does not seemed to have picked a post-match meal. 

On away trips the food is usually prepared by the hotel where the players are based before and after the match. Barcelona may be looking to relocate the next time they play in Malaga after this leak.

The 'Barca picnic', as it is referred to, is usually served in the dressing room or on the team bus that takes the players to the airport or directly back to Barcelona while staples like the fruit smoothies and biscuit given to all players are usually consumed no sooner he leaves the field of play. A player can burn up to 1000 calories in a game so post-match diet is important.

Top Spanish nutritionist Dr Antonio Escribano, who worked with Juande Ramos at Sevilla and Tottenham and famously cut out the ketchup at Spurs' training ground, says: 'What the players eat becomes fuel for the muscles allowing them to recover from training sessions and matches as quickly as possible. It's just like putting petrol back into the car after a long journey.'
