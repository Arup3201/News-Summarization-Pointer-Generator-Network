The giant Comet electrical chain, which has 248 stores and 10,000 staff, has been sold for just £2.

The price, which is cheaper than a pack of batteries, offers grim evidence of the dire straits suffered by many specialist high street retailers.

More significantly, the Comet owner Kesa Electricals is giving the new owners a further £50million to take it off its hands, and retaining liability for the staff pension scheme, which has a £40million deficit.

Electrical chains are among the main 
casualties of the biggest cost of living squeeze in more than 60 years 
as shoppers put off ‘big ticket’ purchases.

Earlier this week the US electricals giant, Best Buy, announced the closure of its 11 UK outlets and abandoned plans to set up a national chain.

Separately, the Dixons group, which includes Currys and PC World, has also issued profits warnings.

The household name chains have been forced to cut prices to tempt shoppers through the door, while they are also being squeezed by online retailers and the supermarkets, who have moved into the market.

Kesa, which has been reviewing options for Comet since June, said the UK chain was expected to make a loss of £22.3 million in the six months to October 31, after like-for-like sales fell 18.6per cent.

Comet was founded in 1933 by George Hollingbery as Comet Battery Stores Limited, as a two man operation charging batteries and accumulators.

It then moved into the radio rental business and by 1939 had 2,500 accounts with a small fleet of vans.

In 1968 Comet opened its first out-of-town electrical retail store,in Hull.

In 1970, the company went public and in 1984 it was taken over in a £129m deal by Kingfisher plc.By 1987 consumer group Verdict recognised Comet as the best retailer of electrical goods in Britain and in 1991 it opens it first service headquarters in Leeds.

The launch of the Comet Price Index in November 1995 reinforced the company's commitment to low prices.

Comet acquires Norweb Retail in 1996 and increased its store portfolio to over 250 stores nationwide.

Leading retail specialist KPMG said, in Retail Week in 2001, that Comet's new concept 'destination stores' pose a serious threat to all competitors in the electricals industry.

In 2005 the stores undergo a £20million re-branding campaign, mainly to differentiate itself from competitors such as Currys.

Its policy was called Every Day Low Pricing, with the promise that they’d check competitors’ prices and reduce theirs to match.

But Comet regularly faced criticism for poor customer service issues and were investigated by Trading Standards for allegedly refusing to refund faulty products.

The store saw its retail profits increase steadily from the years 2000 to 2005, reaching £52million, but since 2008 has seen dramatic decreases due to competitive trading in the economic downturn.

Revenues fell 22 per cent over this summer alone.

The firm has already announced plans 
to shut one of Comet’s three warehouses, axe 12 of its 14 regional 
service centres and close nine under-performing stores as part of a 
cost-cutting drive.

The remaining staff will inevitably fear further closures and redundancies.

Kesa
chairman, David Newlands, explained the decision to pay the new owners 
to take over Comet, saying: ‘The £50million is categorized as an 
investment but the truth of the matter is we had to pay £50million to 
get the business away. We will be writing it off as having no value.’

Kesa has sold the business for a nominal £2 to investment company OpCapita, which is run by the millionaire former investment banker, Henry Jackson, who claims expertise in turning around failing retailers.

He is married to Canadian-born singer Stacey Jackson, a mother of four who is described as a Chelsea ‘yummy mummy’ and had an unlikely UK dance chart hit earlier this year with ‘Live it Up’, featuring rapper Snoop Dog.

Mr Jackson’s predecessor investment company – Merchant Equity Partners - bought MFI for just £1 in 2006 and then sold it to managers in 2008. Despite its involvement, the business subsequently went bust.

Retail analyst Philip Dorgan, of Panmure Gordon, said he could understand the reason for the fire sale.

‘Clearly, the board has decided that sustaining Comet’s losses into an uncertain future is the wrong thing to do and it is difficult to disagree with them,’ he said.

This week, the British Retail Consortium detailed the tough trading conditions for electrical chains in the past month.

It said: ‘It was another tough month, with sales largely promotion-led and often for replacement purposes rather than upgrades.

‘Big-ticket items in particular continued to struggle as uncertainty about jobs and income prospects made people reluctant to spend unless they perceived value or really needed the item.’
