Celebration: Patrick Molloy had gone to Thailand to celebrate his recent release from prison for assault

A British tourist has drowned after jumping into the sea to escape a local gang during a holiday in Thailand, where he was celebrating his recent release from prison.

Patrick Molloy, 28, from Cambridge, leapt into the water in Pattaya, eastern Thailand, alongside friends James Wilks, 29, and Jerry Robson, 30, after they were chased through a restaurant by several Thai men wielding knives and sticks after an argument the previous night.

The argument is reported to have started in the early hours of Sunday, when a group of five or six Thai men confronted them at an all-night disco called Marine 2 Discoteque.

The three Brits were seen running 
through Tankay Seafood Restaurant, on the beach-front and jump into the 
water, all swimming away in different directions.

Mr Wilks managed to find refuge on a yacht while Mr Robson was pulled from the water by a local fisherman.

Meanwhile, Mr Malloy had grabbed the rope of a passing banana boat but witnesses said he passed out, lost his grip and drowned.

His body was found floating in the water around 300 metres from the shore.

A local fisherman attempted in vain to revive him but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr
Malloy's friends were in said to be in shock today as police took 
statements from them in a bid to identify the men they were running 
from.

The trio reportedly jetted to the 
paradise isle days after Mr Molloy completed an 18-week jail sentence 
for a violent assault outside a bar.

He was convicted in August of attacking another man outside Unique bar in Newmarket, Suffolk.

assault, public order offences, affray, and grievous and actual bodily 
harm.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national on December 2 in Pattaya, Thailand.
