A friend of Peaches Geldof's late mother has claimed she desperately tried to confront the young model over her drug abuse, while friends who knew about her heroin addiction 'turned blind eyes'.

Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she reached out to Peaches six years ago in a bid to stop her suffering the same fate as her mother, who died of an accidental heroin overdose when Peaches was 11.

But she said Peaches, a mother-of-two, suffered after those around her 'said nothing' - despite the 25-year-old relapsing.

A family friend of Peaches Geldof and her late mother Paula Yates has told how she tried to confront the 25-year-old about her drug use as others turned 'blind eyes' to her heroin habit

This picture, which Peaches posted hours before her death, shows Paula Yates, who died of an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, with Peaches as a young girl. Gerry Agar said: 'I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches'

She told Grazia magazine: 'I knew she was in trouble with heroin years ago and I tried to confront her about it.

'So many people around her knew about it but said nothing. But I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches.'

The author said she had written Peaches a letter in 2008, encouraging her to wean off the drugs, but that she never heard from her again.

She said she hoped Peaches would change for good after having her two sons - Astala, two, and Phaedra, one - but that she soon relapsed.

She told the magazine that Peaches' death had been 'a horrible waste', just as it was with Miss Yates. 

Ms Agar previously told the Daily Mail how she had blown the whistle on Miss Yates' drug habit in 1996 after she found opium under her bed in a Smarties box.

Detectives did not prosecute Miss Yates because of insufficient evidence.

She told the paper: ‘When Paula took drugs she became another person, really a diabolical being.

‘I don’t think anyone truly understands what life was like in that family and Peaches got the worst of it. I can’t even begin to describe what that poor girl lived through.'

Peaches was found dead at her £1m home in Wrotham, Kent, in April, by her husband Thomas Cohen.

Just a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ Miss Yates died in 2000, aged 41.

At an inquest into Peaches' death, the court heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the family's country home.

Peaches, pictured with her husband Thomas Cohen, had managed to wean herself off the drug but had a relapse in February

North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the sometime television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before her death.

She had battled the addiction for three years and had been taking the heroin substitute methadone and having counselling.

In November 2013, a drugs test showed her to be clean and Mr Cohen believed she had defeated the habit.

But Mr Cohen, a 24-year-old musician, told the inquest she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft.

When he confronted her about it, she 
retrieved a stash she had hidden in the loft and flushed it down the toilet to show
 she was serious about giving up. But she failed to break the habit.

Mr Hatch said Peaches' death was not quite history repeating itself, in regards to Miss Yates' death, because Miss Geldof had tried to 
break her addiction and had returned to the drug for reasons no one 
would ever know.

She had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood. Her mother had 0.3mg when she died.
