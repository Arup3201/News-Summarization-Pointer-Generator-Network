Wanted: Police are trying to identify this man, believed to be linked to the disappearance of Brittany

Massachusetts police are urgently searching for a man believed to be linked to the disappearance of a 17-year-old girl.

Brittany Thompson, who is developmentally delayed, was last seen leaving a library on Monday afternoon with the man pictured below.

It is believed Brittany could be in danger after disappearing with the stranger, who was wearing a 'Fear the Reaper' T-Shirt. 

In an emotional appeal, her mother, 
Maureen Thompson, said: 'Whoever you are, could you please just bring 
her home to us today. I want her to sleep in her own bed tonight.'

The
5ft 6in teenager, who has learning difficulties that make it hard for her to make safe decisions, was last seen wearing a red sleeveless 
top, blue jeans and flip flops, NECN reported.

Her parents said the teenager often studied at the Medfield library where she was last seen, and does not have a cell phone. 

Mrs
Thompson described Brittany as being 'not emotionally a teenager', 
adding that she had trouble making friends and often found it easier to 
contact people on the internet, according to Boston.com.

Currently, her disappearance is not being treated as an abduction, and police Chief Meaney said they suspect Brittany met the man online.

'Both of them appeared to know each other,' he said, adding that she appeared to leave the library voluntarily with him at 4.25pm on Monday.

Brittany's father, Michael, pleaded with his daughter to get in touch, adding: 'Our daughter Brittany is a very loving, caring, trusting 17-year-old girl. She loves music, she loves kittens, she loves eating out.'

The man she was last seen with is described as being white, heavy set and with slicked back hair. He was last seen wearing a Sons of Anarchy T-Shirt with the words Fear the Reaper on it.

Anyone with information is asked to call Massachusetts State Police on (508) 820-2121.
