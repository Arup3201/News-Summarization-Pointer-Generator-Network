In a letter sent to her mother in June 1931, 23-year-old Maine school-teacher Miriam McMichael apologizes for not writing sooner. The irony is, her mother would never receive the note.

Eighty-three years later, both women are dead but the nine-page letter did find its way back to their family after being discovered in a Pittsfield, Massachusetts post office.

The letter was finally delivered last month to Miriam McMichael's niece and recipient Dollena McMichael's granddaughter, 69-year-old Ann MacMichael of Cornville, Maine.

Snail mail: Houlton, Maine school teacher Miriam McMichael sent this letter home to her mother, Dollena McMichael, in 1931. It was finally delivered last month, though both women have since died

The test of time: The nine-page letter was in remarkably good condition when post officials found it last month

'One of the best parts for me of what she wrote was that she apologized for not writing sooner, as she knew her mother had been anxiously waiting all week for a letter — which, as we know, was never received,' Ann MacMichael told the Morning Sentinel.

'She said "I’m just getting around to write. I imagine you have been anxiously waiting for a letter all week. I have no excuses, but that I just didn’t get to it and there are lots of things to tell you, too."'

Michelle Rowell was the Pittsfield post office clerk who discovered the letter, and said one detail made it really stick out.

'As I was sorting I came across it — it appeared to be old, but it was in really good condition,' Rowell said. 'It had a two-cent stamp on it. I knew it was old and the handwriting was old.'

What happened? The letter was discovered by a post office clerk in Pittsfield, Massachusetts while sorting the morning mail. She reckons the letter slipped into sorting equipment where it lay hidden for decades

Lucky: It was a bit of a miracle that the letter was delivered since the family changed their last name from McMichael to MacMichael and moved to Skowhegan, Maine 40 years ago

She reckons the letter slipped 'neatly' into some old sorting equipment where it lay hidden over the decades.

Knowing that the address would not be correct with modern practices, Rowell gave the letter to her postmaster. The postmaster then contacted the Pittsfield Fire Chief who knew the McMichaels moved to Showhegan 40  years ago, and changed their last name to MacMichael.

Skowhegan postmaster Bill Sylvain hand delivered the letter to Red MacMichael, a retired lawyer and District Court judge, who then gave it to his sister Ann.

Now Ms MacMichael is trying to solve the mystery of why the letter never got delivered. She hopes someone will read the news about the letter's resurfacing come forward to say 'I found it' and how.
