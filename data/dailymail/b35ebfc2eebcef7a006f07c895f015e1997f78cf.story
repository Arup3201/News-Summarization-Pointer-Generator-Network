It was a royal family affair last night as Princess Beatrice was taken out for a meal by her parents.

The Duke and Duchess of York treated their eldest daughter to dinner at posh Mayfair restaurant ‘Restaurant C’ last night.

Mother and daughter made quite the fashionable pair with the newly slimmed-down Duchess wowing in a vibrant purple slip dress, accessorised with a turquoise and lilac scarf and Beatrice opting for a tailored cream chiffon shirt which she tucked into a high waisted short black skirt.

Showing they have their fingers firmly placed on the pulse of the fashion world, both Beatrice and Fergie shunned high heels in favour of flat ballet pumps, with Beatrice using her gold studded pair to add flair to her outfit.

Clearly a wardrobe favourite, they are the same pair Beatrice chose to wear on Monday night when she dined out at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse.

Both chose to their long hair loose in a centre parting, making the similarities between mother and daughter even more obvious as they walked arm in arm.

In his customary style, Prince Andrew kept things traditional in a tailored navy suit and blue tie.

The three enjoyed an evening meal inside Restaurant C, which has long been a staple spot for those that dine out in Mayfair.

Serving traditional Italian fare, the venue is also renowned for its cocktails, and though it is not known if the royal family enjoyed a tipple with their meal, the three looked happy and content as they left the venue.

Despite having divorced in 1996, Sarah and Andrew remain on excellent terms and are often seen together at events involving their children. 

It has been a busy week for Fergie’s daughters, with Eugenie flying in from New York to open a new unit at the hospital she was treated at as a child, and Beatrice hitting the town, dining out at trendy new Marylebone eatery, the Chiltern Firehouse.

Beatrice has recently been hailed as the latest member of the royal family to become a face to watch on the fashion circuit, revamping her conservative image as she has been enjoying London life in a range of high fashion outfits.
