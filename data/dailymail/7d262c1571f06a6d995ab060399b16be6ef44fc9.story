The former home of the screenwriter who penned Lawrence of Arabia and Dr Zhivago has been almost entirely destroyed by a fire.

Firefighters were called to the blaze at the cottage in Butleigh in Somerset after the thatched roof of the cottage, previously owned by screenwriter Robert Bolt, caught alight.

Crews spent almost 20 hours battling the fire, which left 75 per cent of the thatched roof destroyed.

Fire crews spent almost 20 hours battling a fire at the former home of Oscar winning screenwriter Robert Bolt

The late Robert Bolt, who won two Oscars for his works, lived at the cottage and is believed to have penned A Man for All Seasons while he was there.

At the height of the blaze 12 crews were trying to control the flames as they licked the roof of the cottage and plumes of smoke could be seen from miles around. 

Firefighters said they managed to rescue a number of possessions from inside the cottage, limiting damage.  

The fire started at about 2.30pm on Wednesday and crews were still damping down at the scene at 7am today.

Police and firefighters sealed off the road in Somerset and the cause of the fire is being investigated  

Crews from Street, Glastonbury, Somerton, Wells, Castle Cary, Cheddar and Bridgwater and Shepton Mallet attended the fire and spent yesterday afternoon stripping the thatch to prevent spread of the flames.

Bolt, who wrote play A Man for All Seasons, twice married Sarah Miles and died in 1995 after a series of strokes. 

Firefighters left the scene at mid morning today and confirmed no one had been injured. 

The cause of the blaze is under investigation.  

The large thatched and stone cottage in Butleigh in Somerset was where Bolt penned A Man for All Seasons 

Robert Bolt twice married Sarah Miles, who nursed him after he was paralysed following a stroke 

Robert Bolt was an English playwright and double Oscar-winning screenwriter. 

He won Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay for Doctor Zhivago and A Man for All Seasons. 

Between 1943 to 1946 he served in the RAF.  

Bolt only became a full-time writer at the age of 33, having previously spent many years worked as a teacher of English and History. 

His first play, The Critic and the Heart, was presented at Oxford Playhouse in 1957. But it was his second work, Flowering Cherry, that earned him critical acclaim.

Bolt was best known for his original play A Man for All Seasons, produced in 1960, but most of his work was writing screenplays. 

He was well known for his screenplays Lawrence of Arabia  (1962) and Doctor Zhivago (1965).

The writer's final script was Political Animal which was made into a film in 1991 and was about the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. 

He was awarded a CBE for his works in 1979. 

The writer spent two weeks in prison in 1961 after he joined controversial group Committee of 100, which strongly opposed the nuclear arms race. 

He was arrested for taking part in a mass sit down protests in Trafalgar Square and sentenced to a month in prison when he refused to be bound over.

He was eventually persuaded to sign a treaty to keep the peace because at the time he was writing the screenplay for Lawrence of Arabia and the director was keen to start filming. Bolt was released after two weeks. 

Bolt had four children and was married four times. 

He twice married Sarah Miles, who he remained with until his death in 1995 at the age of 70. 

Miss Miles nursed Bolt after he had suffered several strokes and was left paralysed in 1979. 

His wife agreed to his eccentric funeral plans - which included meditating beside his body for two days, and burying him in a huge scarlet gown and pink scarf, in a cardboard coffin sunk beyond the croquet lawn in the grounds of their Sussex home.
