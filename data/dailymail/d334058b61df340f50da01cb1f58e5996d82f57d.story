Warring mobile phone firms could delay the launch of superfast 4G mobile phone networks in the UK.

Talks between firms hoping to launch networks are 'in the balance', according to insiders.

EE, the newly rebranded firm from Orange and T-Mobile, plans to launch its service within weeks using a number of handsets including Apple's iPhone 5.

CEO of EE, Olaf Swantee, said today the firms 4G network will launch on October 30th

Operators are asking Ofcom to bring forward the auction spectrum they need to launch 4G services in the UK, which was due to take place next year.

They are also asking for the spectrum needed to be freed up quickly, which is currently scheduled for September 2013.

These frequencies are currently in use by Air Traffic Control, analogue
 television broadcast and radio waves used for the Olympics and 
Paralympics. 

However, other operators must wait for a Government auction to buy the spectrum needed to launch such service, which offer speeds three time faster than current 3G networks.

The move to give EE an advantage has left other operators furious, and threatening legal action.

This could see the entire process stalled, meaning no 4G network can be launched until the spectrum auction has been taken place - likely to be at least 12 months away.

A source close to the talks said operators were keen to bring the auction forward, and clear the spectrum needed quickly.

These frequencies are currently in use for Air Traffic Control, analogue
 television broadcast and radio waves used for the Olympics and 
Paralympics.

'It’s fair to say that we’re in discussions with the wider industry over 4G spectrum, but this is in an attempt to bring 4G to all UK customers, not to delay the launch of 4G,' said an O2 Spokesperson.

'As a result, we’re talking as a group about the possibility of bringing the auction forward and asking if the frequencies used in the spectrum can be cleared quickly.'

Experts say further delays could be devastating for consumers.

'I can understand why the other 
networks would complain - it's a pretty compelling reason to jump ship 
if you're on another network,' said Will Findlater, the editor of gadget
 magazine Stuff.

'Delaying the rollout is not going to be good for consumers in general, and it would be pretty devastating.'

The move would also put the UK behind other countries where 4G services have been available for several months.

Key issues are believed to include accelerating the long-awaited auction of the 4G spectrum, as well as streamlining the planning system for faster rollout of mobile masts.

London Mayor Boris Johnson backed the launch of EE, the UK's first super fast 4G network. however, it could now face legal challenges from rival operators.

People close to the talks said they were 'hopeful' the issues could be resolved before the end of a government-brokered month-long standstill agreement that prevents legal action as well as any 4G launch.

Any delay could also have a huge impact on government finances next year given the £4bn that could be raised by the auction of 4G spectrum, according to analysts.

EE, the UK’s largest mobile network with the Orange and T-Mobile brands, said this month that it wanted to launch 4G in the UK this year, but has been unable to give an exact date due to the talks.

It says that it plans to reach 16 UK cities by Christmas and 98 per cent of population by 2014.

The talks are also discussing the formation of a company called MitCo that will make sure TV and other services do not interfere with 4G networks, as well as streamlining the process of planning permission  for new masts needed.

One person familiar with the talks told the FT there was a threat of 'years of litigation' remaining.

In addition to fears legal action could be launched to stop EE's 4G service, there are also concerns that litigation could affect the 4G auction, which is set to take place early next year.

Ofcom said it expects the auction process to start before the end of this year, with prospective bidders required formally to apply to take part.

Those applications will then be assessed by Ofcom before the bidding phase starts, likely to be in early 2013.

Mobile operators are expected to start rolling out 4G networks using the auctioned spectrum from the middle of 2013, and to start offering 4G services to consumers later that year, Ofcom added.
