Could you tell the difference between a human eye and the eye of a tiger, python, or a lemur?

This is the premise behind Armenian photographer Suren Manvelyan's latest collection, which features extreme close-up images showing eyes of animals, birds and reptiles.

The collection includes rodents, hyenas, lemurs, monkeys, tiger pythons, cats, dogs, snakes, birds, a fox and even a flying possum.

Husky dog: Huskies mainly live in the Arctic and are known for having pale blue eyes. However, some species have been known to have brown, green and yellow eyes

Fennec fox: The fennec is a small nocturnal fox that lives in the Sahara desert in Africa. Its eye resembles what paleontologists believe many dinosaur eyes to look like. The fox is known for its large ears, which help keep it cool

Lark: Larks are passerine birds, also known as perching birds or songbirds. The majority live in dry regions, in northern and eastern Australia. Larks are medium-sized birds, between five to eight inches long and weigh between 15 and 75 grams

Long-eared owl: The long-eared owl is indigenous to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is between 12 to 16 inches long and has a wingspan of around 39 inches

Chinchilla: The chinchilla has the most distinctive pupil of Manvelyan's collection. It is a rodent native to the Andes mountains in South America. The name chinchilla means 'little chincha' and is named after the Chincha people of the Andes, who used to wear its fur

Iris recognition (IR) is an example of biometric identification.

Biometrics uses a person's unique features, such as irises and fingerprints, to identify who they are.

Everyone's iris has a complex, random pattern that is different to anyone elses.

IR uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques to scan this random design. 

The scans analyse more than 200 points that can be used for comparison, 
including rings and freckles.

The technology was first proposed in 1936 by ophthalmologist Frank Burch.

In 1987 two ophthalmologists, Aran Safir and Leonard Flom, patented the idea.

John Daugman then created algorithms for iris recognition in 1989.

Each of the photos in Manvelyan's collection show the complex surface of individual animal eyes.

Many of Manvelyan's images were taken of animals in captivity at Yerevan Zoo in Armenia.

Manvelyan's Animal Eyes collection was a follow-up to his Your Beautiful Eyes series which features extreme close-up images of human eyes. 

Although the eyes look different, they work in a very similar way to human eyes.

The main parts of the eye include the cornea, pupil, iris, retina and radial and sphincter muscles.

When the animals look around, the light reflected from different objects enter their eyes through the transparent cover called the cornea.

The light then travels into the eye through the pupil.

The pupil is the black circular part in the centre of your eyeball.

The
varying pupil shapes and sizes of the animals in Manvelyan's collection
is determined by where in the world they live and how much sunlight 
they get.

It also depends on whether they are nocturnal or not.

Lemur: Lemurs only see in black and white. This means they don't choose food based on what it looks like, but instead of how it smells. Their monochrome vision makes it easier to see at night. The word 'lemur' comes from the Roman mythological word, lemures, which means ghosts or spirits

Iguana: Iguanas use their eyes to navigate through forests and find food. They use visual signals to communicate with other iguanas, and have a third 'eye' on top of their heads called the parietal eye. The parietal eye is a scale that contains photoreceptors to detect different light ranges

Abino tiger python: The albino tiger python is a specially bred species of the Asiatic python, found predominantly in Southeast Asia. They can grow up to around seven metres long making them the world's longest reptiles

Rhesus macaque: Also known as the rhesus monkey, their eyes most closely resemble human eyes. In January 2000 the rhesus macaque became the first primate to be cloned, and in January 2001, the first transgenic rhesus primate was born that contained genes taken from jellyfish

Black kite: The black kite is a bird of prey, so-called because it soars and glides in search of food, and can change direction smoothly and quickly. The birds often get electrocuted because they perch on electric wires

Radial
fibres within the iris - the coloured part of the eye- pull the pupil 
open when it's dark to let more light in and make it easier to see in 
low-light conditions.

Nocturnal animals, such as the Fennec fox, have larger pupils to make easier to see at night.

Sphincter
fibres help the pupil contract to restrict how much light enters the 
eye in bright conditions.

Chimpanzee: Chimpanzees, also known as chimps, have eyes similar to humans because they can distinguish colours that other mammals can't see. The eyes on a chimp are close together, like on humans, so they can see stereoscopically and make out shapes in 3D, with depth perception

Tockus: The tockus is a type of hornbill bird found in Africa. They have binocular vision, although unlike most birds with this type of eyesight, the tockus' bill can sometimes get in the way and obstruct their view

Guinea pig: The guinea-pig is a domesticated rodent, also known as cavy. It doesn't exist naturally in the wild. The term to be used as a 'guinea pig', referring to being a test subject, comes from when the rodents were tested on during the 19th century

Hyena: Spotted hyena cubs are born almost fully developed with their eyes open. Although they look like felines, they behave more like canines and have a keen sense of smell which they use for hunting. Their body parts are used for medicines in some parts of Africa

Siamese cat: The Siamese cat originated in Thailand, formerly Siam. They are known as Wichian Mat or 'moon diamond' because of the shape and colouring of their eyes. Only pure bred Siamese cats have light blue eyes

Husky dogs live in very bright conditions in the Arctic, so their pupils are smaller.

The lens focuses the light onto the back of 
the eye called the retina.

The
retina is made of thousands of light-sensitive neurons, called 
photoreceptors, which change light signals into electrical ones.

These
electrical signals are then sent to the brain along the optic nerve and
the brain processes what it's looking at in the visual cortex.

When you look at an object it is projected onto your retina upside down.

Your brain then turns it the correct way up.

There are some differences, however, depending on the species.

For example, lemurs can only see in black and white so use their sense of smell to choose which food to eat.

And husky dogs can have different coloured eyes because of a condition called heterochromia.
