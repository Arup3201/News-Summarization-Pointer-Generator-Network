Huma Abedin professes her love for her husband in an unfortunately-timed essay in Harper's Bazaar which came out just hours after another woman revealed the sex chats she had with the disgraced former Congressman.

The article comes as a vow of support for his bid to become New York City's next mayor, and was released the morning after the notoriously private Abedin spoke out at his press conference Tuesday where he confirmed that he will not be dropping out of the race. 

'People have said many things about my 
husband—some nice, some not so nice. And that will surely continue. 
Launching this campaign was not an easy decision for our family to make.
Putting yourself out there comes with a cost,' she wrote in Harper's Bazaar.

In a column that will appear in the magazine's September edition, the longtime Hillary Clinton aide tells how she went from being a 'single workaholic' to a wife and mother in a matter of three years.

'I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him': Huma Abedin read a statement at the Tuesday press conference reaffirming her belief in her husband and their marriage

Facing the backlash: Weiner addressed reporters in front of his apartment building on Wednesday morning but he did not have his wife at his side this time

When her husband Anthony Weiner launched his campaign to run for mayor of New York City two years after resigning from Congress amid a Twitter sexting scandal, he said that there were other women who would come forward with allegations against him.

Opening up: Huma Abedin wrote an essay in the upcoming issue of Harper's Bazaar about how she decided to forgive her husband and supports his run for mayor

In the essay, she said that in addition 
to being the 'smart, caring, and dedicated person' he has always been, 
'he is now something else- a better man'.

What Abedin likely didn't know was that one such woman would release screen grabs of her virtual conversations with Weiner and the naked pictures he sent of himself- just days before the Harper's Bazaar issue hit newsstands.

'New Yorkers will have to decide for themselves whether or not to give him a second chance. I had to make that same decision for myself, for my son, for our family. And I know in my heart that I made the right one,' she wrote in a preview of the piece that was posted on the magazine's website.

Though Abedin has worked for Hillary Clinton for nearly two decades, starting when she was an intern in the White House and worked for the then-First Lady.

In her role as Mrs Clinton's top aide, she has kept to the sidelines, leaving her boss to be the focus of attention.

'I
kept my personal life private, even as the people I was close to lived 
in the public eye. But all that changed two years ago, and Anthony and I
have spent these past few years working through the very private 
challenges we faced on a very public stage,' she wrote in Harper's 
Bazaar.

Her husband's bid 
for Mayor changed all that. She first appeared in one of his campaign 
ads and made her press conference debut on Tuesday when she read a 
statement in defense of her husband.

Public defense: Abedin broke her notoriously private shell by appearing alongside her husband a year after he resigned in a July 2012 People article. It was revealed he maintained online relationships even at that time

'When we faced this publicly two years
ago it was the beginning of a time in our marriage that was very 
difficult and it took us a very long time to get through it,' Ms Abedin 
said at today's press conference.

Together: In the Harper's Bazaar article, Abedin talks about how she went from being a 'single workaholic' to a wife and mother in three years, seen here at their 2010 wedding

'Anthony's
made some horrible mistakes both before he resigned from congress and 
after but I do very strongly believe that that is between us.

'I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him.'

For
his part, Weiner said that his wife was aware that he was still making 
contact with women he had never met even after he resigned, and he said 
that his June 2011 departure from Congress was not the end to his 
inappropriate behavior.

'She
knew all along this process as I was more and more honest with her, I 
told her everything so this is something we knew going into this season 
of (campaigning).

'I'm pleased and blessed that she has 
given me a second chance. For the past several months I have asked New 
Yorkers to give me a second chance.

'Its
in our rear view mirror but it's not far and we continue to work on our
marriage. Frankly we're in a lot better place today or else I would not
have run for mayor.'

Many public figures have come out to support Abedin, praising her remarks at the press conference, including Donald Trump who called her 'impressive'.

Congressman Charles Rangel, who has 
been the Democratic representative for Harlem for over 40 years, echoed those sentiments on MSNBC Wednesday morning.

'Nobody
that I know understands at all what Anthony Weiner was thinking about. 
And right now, I think you would agree that we all are concerned about 
his wife. She's a brave lady,' Congressman Rangel told MSNBC on 
Wednesday.

'I have seen
a lot of things like this in politics where males have to lean on their
wives for support, but I don't ever recall seeing a wife looking and 
feeling so sad and embarrassed, because Huma is a very private person, a
very delicate, sophisticated person. And all the years that I've known 
her, putting her into this political situation, as bright and as 
intelligent as she is, is very awkward.'

In 
spite of her claims that his sexual proclivities are a personal matter, 
they have made a very purposeful- and planned- re-entry into public life
with a number of interviews.

The first came in the June 30, 2012 issue of People Magazine, where they posed for a family portrait and Weiner opened up about how they had worked through their problems.

Now the 'normal family' that they claimed to be is seen as even more of a facade as it was revealed yesterday that he began exchanging explicit messages and photos with a woman online less than two weeks after the People issue hit newsstands. 

He would not go into the specifics of 
when he began talking with the woman who has since been revealed as 
Sydney Leathers, but she told gossip site The Dirty that their first 
contact took place on July 12, 2012.

To
many that came as a shock because it was assumed that his inappropriate
behavior came to a stop after he resigned from Congress in June 2011.

Leathers
was revealed to be a blogger for the Indiana Progressive Liberals who 
worked as a part of President Obama's field campaign during his 2012 bid
for re-election.

WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT

The latest woman: Syndey Leathers, 23, was identified as the one who Weiner was talking to online in 2012

Virtual exchange: She released screengrabs of their conversations and pictures of his genitals that he sent

She sent screenshots of conversations she had with Weiner over social media site Formspring, where he used the screenname 'Carlos Danger' and described his sexual fantasies, such as: 'So I walk in to a hotel room and you are at the end of the bed. naked except for some amazing f*** me shoes. your legs are ******. your feet are flat on the ground you are leaning slightly forward. looking completely in charge.'

Photos: The Dirty also released two pictures that the unidentified woman claimed Weiner sent her of his genitals

'I like to whisper in your ear while I make love to you. That ok?' he wrote.

'Taking a shower. Wanna join me?'

'Staring at pics of u. Pathetic?'

'If I met you in a bar and tried to talk to you, would I have a chance?'

'You are a walking fantasy.'

The publisher of The Dirty is Nik Ritchie, who wrote Tuesday that the then-unidentified woman has hired a lawyer 'in fear of Anthony Weiner but she is willing to expose his sexual nature to TheDirty.com for the betterment of America'.

She released a statement through the site: 'Although I was 22 and technically an adult, I was obviously immature and I acted irresponsibly. I realize my correspondence with Mr Anthony Weiner was a huge mistake and I am embarrassed by it.'
