The first lady has come under criticism for her recent media blitz, with some lambasting her for her unprecedented number of appearances on entertainment and programs.

Michelle Obama has certainly made the rounds in the past week, from promoting an anti-obesity campaign with late night host Jimmy Fallon to her surprise Oscars appearance announcing the Best Picture winner.

Today, it was revealed she will be joining Kelly Ripa from LIVE with Kelly and Michael for a 'hangout with The First Lady' day on March 4, where the pair with discuss 'fitness, family and fun.'

Critics complain that Mrs Obama is overstepping her reach and risks losing favor with the public for being overexposed.

Media blitz: Critics are complaining that Michelle Obama is becoming too ubiquitous on TV; an interview with GMA's Robin Roberts aired today, one of many recent appearances

Silver lady: Mrs Obama presented the Best Picture Oscar to 'Argo' live from the Diplomatic Room of the White House on February 24 during the Oscars

The runaround: Mrs Obama made the talk show rounds, visiting 'Good Morning America' on February 21 before stopping by 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'; the shows air dates have been staggered

Conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin told NBC White House correspondent Kristen Welker that it was the first lady’s unannounced appearance at the Oscars that was the tipping point.

Mrs Obama’s surprise Oscars appearance via video link– the reported brainchild of producer Harvey Weinstein – seemed to draw the most ire.

‘There is a sense of going too far and too much and becoming so ubiquitous that people don’t consider you something special,’ she told NBC.

‘She's the first lady… not a Hollywood celebrity.’

Fox News Radio reporter Todd Starnes chimed in on Mrs Obama’s Oscars appearance, saying that she 'probably felt like she was entitled to upstage' the event. 

Shake it: Host Jimmy Fallon dressed as a mom, left, danced with first lady Michelle Obama during an appearance of 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon' on February 22; she was promoting her 'Let's Move' campaign

Still to come: Mrs Obama filmed an appearance of 'Dr Oz' on February 22; it will air Thursday

Breitbart.com
went one step further, calling it a ‘Deus ex machine moment’ that ‘was 
just obscene and rather frightening in what it suggests about how low we
have fallen as a nation. Healthy societies do not create political 
personality cults.’

The Oscars was only one of her recent media appearances though. She appeared in a now-viral video with Jimmy Fallon promoting ‘Let’s Move,’ showing her strength by doing push-ups and dancing opposite the NBC late night host.

During the interview, Fallon asked if she had plans to run with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, to which she cheekily responded: ‘You know, I have my eye actually on another job.

‘I hear that when Jay Leno retires that the “Tonight Show” position is going to open, and I’m thinking about putting my hat in the ring.’

Let's move: In one of two PSAs that aired on February 21, the First Lady explains how important it is to 'get your body moving every single day,' while Big Bird dances in the background

Nutritious snacks: In one video in the White House kitchen, Big Bird says to the First Lady, 'Gee, I bet you can get just anything you want in this kitchen.' Michelle said she likes to choose fruits and vegetables

Today, the first lady again appeared on 
‘Good Morning America’ to speak with anchor Robin Roberts, a week after 
she and Mr Obama were on the show via video link welcoming her back to 
the show following a bone marrow transplant operation.

The interview, which was broadcast 
today, was one of Robin Roberts' first assignments since she returned to
the show following bone marrow transplant surgery five months ago.

Newsbusters.org criticized the interview for being filled with softball questions focusing around her new bangs, her fashion, and the success of her family and the president’s second term in office.

After her treatment left her bald, Roberts said that her stylist had picked out a wig for her that resembled the first lady's new haircut - complete with bangs.

They then went on to a cooking segment.

Indeed, Mrs Obama has been much more in the public eye during the president’s second term.

First congrats: The president and first lady appeared on 'Good Morning America' on February 20 to congratulate anchor Robin Roberts on her return to the show following her illness

Most if not all of her personal agenda are relatively low of controversy, and include ‘Let’s Move,’ the anti-obesity campaign she started in her first run as first lady.

February 20: Appeared via video link with Barack Obama on ‘Good Morning America’ to congratulate anchor Robin Roberts on her return after serious illness

AND TO COME...

March 4: Appearing on LIVE with Kelly and Michael for a 'hangout with The First Lady' day

Ohio University history professor Katherine Jellison, who specializes in America’s first ladies,told The Hill that Mrs Obama’s media exposure is unprecedented.

‘She seems to be enjoying her celebrity status more than she ever has before,’ Professor Jellison said. ‘She’s much more comfortable with it.’

She will next appear on ‘The Dr Oz Show’ on Thursday in a segment that was recorded on February 21.

But the first lady has not ignored her duties as first lady, either, speaking at this week’s meeting of the National Governors Association and attending a dinner for the NGA the night of the Oscars, sitting opposite New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

According to the Hill, who spoke to the first lady’s communications director Kristina Schake, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences requested her appearance.

‘As a movie lover, she was honored to present the award and celebrate the artists who inspire us all,’ she said.

Jodi Kantor, a New York Times writer and author of the book ‘The Obamas,’ told NBC News that each of Mrs Obama’s appearances is carefully-orchestrated and part of a vast PR approach.

‘It’s almost as if her real strategy is a kind of charm offensive that is then intended to build support for her husband’s initiative,’ she said.
