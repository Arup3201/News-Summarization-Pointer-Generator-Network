Plans to stop experiments counting towards science A-levels will leave youngsters without vital skills for the workplace, business leaders have warned.

The Confederation of British Industry said it was ‘viscerally opposed’ to the plans, which were announced by exams watchdog Ofqual following evidence that teachers were inflating marks for pupils in laboratory work, which is internally assessed.

Sixth formers’ practical skills will still be assessed, although marks will appear separately from the final grade.The CBI fears this will lead to laboratory skills being neglected by schools.

Crucial: The Confederation of British Industry says axing coursework for science students will harm skills

Practical work is vital to help teenagers progress into higher education or employment, it added, and the proposed change would lead to lab skills becoming ‘neglected or de-prioritised’.

‘While there are obvious challenges in the design and assessment of these skills, their importance means that the removal of marks from the final grade would be a significant step backwards and could undermine employer confidence in the qualification,’ it said.

‘Rather than remove these contributory marks, the focus should be on addressing the challenges outlined in the consultation document such as the issue of potential marking inconsistencies.’

Neil Carberry, The CBI's head of employment and skills, said the proposal could undermine employer confidence in the qualification and Ofqual should instead by focusing on tackling ‘marking inconsistencies’.

‘We want practical assessment in science because, frankly, science is a practical subject,’ he said at an education conference in Nottingham.

Help: Ofqual said there was evidence of teachers helping pupils with coursework, which is marked internally

‘The proposal that the curriculum will no longer contain contributory marks for practical skills is one we viscerally oppose.

‘For us, functional English, functional maths at GCSE and A-level are absolutely essential and we want them in the curriculum. We also want practical assessment in science because, frankly, science is a practical subject by its very nature.'

Ofqual announced its intention to cut 
back on coursework in a range of A-levels three months ago in an attempt
 to clamp down on cheating.

At the time it pointed out in some 
units marked by teachers, pupils’ performance often ‘greatly exceeds’ 
their results in written exams.

In future, it will only feature in 
qualifications where practical skills cannot be assessed by an exam - 
such as in geography fieldwork or art.

The exam board insisted yesterday that it had to tackle ‘some intractable issues’ including ‘malpractice’ and teachers focusing on ‘the limited range of skills typically required for the assessments’.
