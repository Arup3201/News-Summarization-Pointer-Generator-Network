A former executive of the bank that helped trigger the Royal Bank of Scotland's collapse has been found dead along with his wife and daughter.

Jan Peter Schmittmann, 57, came under fire for taking a large pay-off after the nationalisation of his troubled bank ABN Amro.

He ran the domestic operations of the Dutch bank between 2003 and 2007 and was widely criticised for landing a £6.6million ($10.95 million) pay-off.

It followed the bank's collapse, takeover by RBS and subsequent nationalisation.

Police in the Netherlands said they visited his house in 
the wealthy commuter town of Laren, east of Amsterdam, early on Saturday after being alerted
 by a family friend.

There they found his body along with those of his 57-year-old wife Nelly and 22-year-old younger daughter Babette.

A police spokeswoman said an investigation was underway but that all early clues pointed to a family drama having taken place.

There was no indication that Schmittmann's business dealings had played any role in the tragedy.

The
 daily Algemeen Dagblad said the three were found by Schmittmann's elder
 daughter who had come to visit before departing for India, where she 
had been due to do an internship.

The elder daughter was in the care of wider family and the police victim care unit, police spokeswoman Leonie Bosselaar said.

Schmittmann
 paved the way for ABN Amro's break-up and sale in 2007 to a consortium 
of the banks Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Santander.

After they came into difficulties 
during the global financial crisis, the Dutch government nationalised 
the core Dutch operations of ABN Amro.

When
 he left the bank after its nationalisation in 2008, Schmittmann was 
contractually due a 16 million euro pay-off, a sum that was halved after
 then finance minister Wouter Bos described it as 'exorbitant'.

A spokesman for ABN Amro told MailOnline: 'We are all very shocked.'

For RBS - and the world economy - the deal to take over ABN Amro was a calamity.

In 2007 RBS, led by the then Sir Fred Goodwin, was on its way to becoming the world's biggest bank, with assets of £1.9 trillion.

But following the deal to buy up parts of ABN Amro, in a 73.3 billion euro ($100.5 billion) deal with Fortis and Banco 
Santander SA, the shaky foundations on which the the RBS financial monster was built started to emerge.

At the time the deal was the biggest banking takeover in history, but it quickly turned into a disaster.

Not
 only was it concluded at an inflated price after a hostile bidding 
process, but just as the world economy teetered on the edge of the great
 recession.

Then Lehman 
Brothers went out of business. That earthquake triggered a financial 
tsunami which went on to flatten RBS, which had to be rescued by 
taxpayers 12 months later at the cost of £45.2 billion.

Five years on a Treasury Committee 
report - titled 'The FSA'’s report into the failure of RBS' - concluded 
that the Financial Services Authority should and could have intervened 
in the doomed takeover.

Goodwin, the bank’s former chief executive, was stripped of his knighthood in 2012, but has never been censured by the regulator as a result of RBS's collapse.

Much of ABN Amro's operations had to be split 
  out to reform it following the collapse and in 2012 RBS 'sold' back to the Dutch lender parts of its businesses originally acquired in 2007.

Selling
 the Dutch business continued RBS's rapid downsizing of its global 
banking and markets arm to restructure the bank and focus it more on UK 
retail and commercial banking.
