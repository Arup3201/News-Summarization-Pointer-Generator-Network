David and Teresa Yeates outside Bristol Crown Court yesterday, for the trial of Vincent Tabak

Joanna Yeates's mother wept in court yesterday as photographs were shown of her daughter's dead body.

Until that point, Teresa Yeates and her husband David had chosen not to be present during those parts of the murder trial when images of the 25-year-old's corpse were displayed to the jury.

Mrs Yeates, 58, broke down as a mortuary image of the landscape architect was shown on court screens before she and her husband both averted their eyes.

The picture showed Miss Yeates lying in the foetal position with her pink top pushed up, exposing her bra.

Comforting his wife and holding both her hands tightly, Mr Yeates, 63, then turned his head and glared for several seconds towards the dock, where his daughter's killer, Vincent Tabak, sat facing the floor with his hands clasped over his head.

The jury was told that 33-year-old Tabak could have placed Miss Yeates's body inside a cover sheet he used to protect his bicycle before she was bundled into the boot of his car.

Lawyers for the defence suggested that traces of his DNA found on his victim’s  breasts and jeans could have come from this ‘bicycle bag’.

The same post-mortem examination images seen by Mr and Mrs Yeates had caused Tabak, who admits manslaughter but denies murder, to cry when they were first shown to the jury last week.

The pictures were displayed during evidence from a forensic scientist who had examined blood stains found on a wall next to the country road where Miss Yeates’s snow-covered body was found on Christmas morning last year.

The expert said the blood pattern indicated smearing rather than spattering, meaning it was unlikely that Miss Yeates had been assaulted at the spot on Longwood Lane in Failand, near Bristol.

Tanya Nickson told the jury: ‘The presence of the blood on the top of the wall may indicate an attempt was made to deposit the body over the top of the wall.’

The court also heard that when Tabak was arrested a month after his next-door neighbour Miss Yeates was announced missing, he appeared ‘shaky’ after the police’s early-morning arrival at the friend’s flat where he and his girlfriend were temporarily staying a couple of miles away.

In the police station later on, the jury heard, two small wounds were seen on his left arm.

Tabak, who had been under 24-hour supervision at HMP Long Lartin, was said to have told Mr Brotherton of his plan to plead guilty three weeks after his arrest

The 6ft 4in Dutchman told a custody nurse he had been taking sleeping pills and drinking more in the weeks after Miss Yeates died ‘to help him relax’.

He was later interviewed several times by detectives, who questioned him about his activities on the night Miss Yeates was killed.

The court heard that Tabak refused to comment when police asked him a series of questions, including whether Miss Yeates had invited him into her flat in the Clifton area of Bristol, if he made sexual advances to her and if he had been inside her bedroom.

The jury was also told that the Dutch engineer claimed to police he had gone to take pictures of Clifton in the snow on December 17, before returning home and visiting a nearby Asda because ‘he liked to be in large supermarkets at night’.

The defendant said he had brought his car into the drive during the evening to defrost it and get it ready to collect his girlfriend from her work Christmas party.

He also said he had slipped over on the pathway to his flat – but did not mention having any contact with Miss Yeates.

Tabak is said to have ‘squeezed the life’ out of his neighbour in a ‘desperate’ struggle at her flat just minutes after she arrived home alone, while her boyfriend Greg Reardon was away.

He is alleged to have driven with the body in the boot of his car to Asda, where he bought beer, rock salt and crisps.

Miss Yeates sustained 43 separate injuries before being dumped in the snow.

A couple walking their dog found her body, partially clothed, 100 yards down the lane, on Christmas Day morning.

The trial at Bristol Crown Court continues.
