All we want for Christmas is to look like Kate, apparently, as the Duchess of Cambridge’s delicate nose tops the list of the most requested celebrity face parts by plastic surgery patients this year.

If you thought she was lucky for finding love, marrying a prince and now expecting a baby, it seems her natural beauty can now be added on to the list of things to envy Kate for.

Over the past year requests to plastic surgeons to look like Kate Middleton have trebled, new figures reveal.

The Duchess of Cambridge has the most desired nose of plastic surgery patients, with requests trebling in 2012

And the duchess is not the only celebrity we are willing to go under the knife to imitate.

Cheryl Cole’s dimpled cheeks and Myleene Klass’s chin were other highly requested body parts by patients.

While the bedroom eyes of Rosie Huntington-Whitley and the sexy full pout of X factor judge Nicole Scherzinger are also must-haves for women wanting to change their looks.

And it's not just women who are turning to celebrities for inspiration when undergoing plastic surgery.

There has been a jump in men citing star’s body parts as their ideal when going under the knife.

Top of men’s wish lists is a jaw like heart throb Robert Pattinson, Ashton Kutcher’s chiseled cheeks and Zac Effron’s luscious locks and smouldering eyes.

Clearly hoping to fake their way to heart throb status, men also want the lips of Ryan Gosling and the nose of notoriously cheeky ladies’ man Jude Law.

The figures have been released by the Transform Cosmetic Surgery Group who offer cosmetic procedures such as breast enlargement, face lifts, botox and liposuction and have seen a huge rise in people requesting specific celebrity body parts.

A spokesman from the company said: ‘People are choosing celebrities who are sophisticated and naturally beautiful.’
