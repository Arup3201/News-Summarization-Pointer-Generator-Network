Shoppers at Tesco can now pop in for bread, milk – and an HIV test that takes just one minute to perform.

The check-up will be offered from Monday at Tesco Extra in central Slough, with the results ready in just 20 minutes.

The scheme is being run by campaign group Thames Valley Positive Support (TVPS), with the aim of ‘normalising’ sexual health tests.

The free test, which takes place in a private room, is carried out using a mouth swab that is rubbed once along the upper and lower gums.

While customers wait for the results, they will be able to talk over any sexual health concerns they have with the practitioner that administers the test.

TVPS chief executive Sarah Macadam told Metro: ‘Testing in supermarkets has only ever been offered as a one-off event and not a regular basis.

‘We are extremely pleased that Tesco are so committed to their community’s well-being which is enabling us to bring such an innovation in testing to Slough.’

Concern: There are currently over 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK, according to Public Health England

The charity said that Slough has been targeted because it’s been identified as an HIV ‘hotspot’, with the third-highest rate of infection in the south-east outside London.

There are currently over 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK, according to Public Health England.

Campaigners are concerned that of these, a fifth do not know that they are carrying the infection.

The Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘People who have HIV but don’t yet know it are far more likely to pass the virus on unwittingly.’

In 2012, 490 people in the UK with HIV died.
