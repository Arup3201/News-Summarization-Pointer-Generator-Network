Court: Peruvian Enrique Milla testifying in a Miami court over Skype in a case relation to his penis amputation

Attempts to put the spark back into his marriage have ended very, very badly for one man. His wife isn't too happy either.

Enrique Milla decided to have an operation to help cure his impotence which saw doctors put an implant in his penis.

But the former Miami resident later had to have his member amputated after a small infection that developed after the operation went gangrenous, The Miami Herald reports.

The 65-year-old Peruvian has now launched unusual medical malpractice trial in a Miami court in a bid to get compensation.

He is blaming his anaesthetist Dr Laurentiu Boeru for decisions that led to the infection and eventual life-saving amputation of his penis.

The case which opened on Monday will see a jury will have to decide whether an anaesthetist can be held liable.

Mr Milla is testifying at the trial via Skype because American authorities deported him and his family back to Peru last year.

Spencer Aronfeld, Milla’s lawyer said: 'This has been devastating, painful and embarrassing.

'Mr Milla lived in Miami for 40 years and worked in the medical supply business and paid taxes.

'It shouldn’t make a difference that he was deported. At the end of the day, he has to sit down to pee through a tube.'

Mr Milla's private and personal horror, illustrated with pictures of his penis in various stages of decay, will be put as evidence to the the courtroom, Local 10 reports.

Operation: The Coral Gables Hospital where Mr Milla had the penis implant that he claims caused an infection that resulted in him needed a life saving organ amputation

Mr Aronfeld said Mr Milla, then 60, didn't go under the knife to have a bigger penis.

He said: 'This was because of medical reasons: He just wanted to have relations with his wife.'

The lawyer is arguing that anaesthetist should have known that Milla wasn’t in top physical shape at the time of the surgery and would have a hard time recovering.

He said: 'Milla had high diabetes and high blood pressure when they cleared him for surgery. They should postpone the surgery until he got better.'

The procedure took place in August 2007 at the Coral Gables Hospital in Miami. The infection that consumed Milla's privates and led to the amputation started more than a week later.

Milla originally filed the lawsuit in 2009, naming Boeru and urologist Dr Paul Perito, the penile implant expert who performed the surgery,  Local 10 reports.

Court records show Dr Perito settled with Mr Milla last year, although the details of the deal were not publicly available.Dr Boeru’s lawyer Jay Chimpoulis said: 'What happened to Mr Milla was just bad luck. But filing frivolous lawsuits won’t change his bad luck.'
