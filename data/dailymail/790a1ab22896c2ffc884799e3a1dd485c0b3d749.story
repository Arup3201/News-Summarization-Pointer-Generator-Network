Two Australians have agreed to pay a fine for flying in Indonesian airspace without permits, but will not be free to leave the country immediately.

Indonesian fighter jet pilots were moments away from shooting down the light plane piloted by the two Australian nationals who reportedly failed to comply with Indonesia's order to land, on Wednesday.

Indonesian pilot Major Wanda Suriansyah said two Sukhoi fighters 'locked' their weapon systems and aimed directly at the Australian plane carrying pilots Graeme Paul Jacklin and Richard Wayne MacLean,Tempo.co reported.

Graeme Paul Jacklin (front) and Richard Wayne MacLean (back) were taken into custody after being forced to land their light plane after allegedly 'violating' Indonesian airspace on Wednesday 

'If there had been a command to shoot, I would immediately have shot it down, but thank God the pilot was apparently scared and decided to land the plane in Manado,' Major Wanda said.  

Mr Jacklin and Mr MacLean were en route from Darwin to the Philippines when their light plane was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday.

The pair, who are professional delivery pilots, were flying to Cebu in the Philippines to deliver the light plane after selling it.

Military spokesperson, Major-General Fuad Basya, said the two men did not have permission to fly into Indonesian airspace and initially refused several requests to land, Fairfax Media reports.

'Some Australians are stubborn so they ignored the request,' Major Wanda said. 

Two Indonesian Air Force jets followed the plane and ordered the men to land in Manado shortly after 10.30am local time where they were met by snipers on the tarmac who had their rifles pointed towards the aircraft. 

On landing at Sam Ratulangi Airport, Manado, about 20 air force and airport officers swarmed the aircraft. 

They were arrested at gunpoint after being forced to land their light plane by two Indonesian fighter jets for allegedly 'violating' the country's airspace.  

A witness, Adolof, said about half of them had weapons.

'They were laying on the ground while waiting for the plane to land,' he said.

'After it landed the pilots came out and were searched.'

The Australians looked annoyed as they were ordered off the plane and frisked, he told AAP.

'When they got off the plane they were taken to the office, then airport staff took documents from the plane,' he said.

Richard MacLean's wife Kaye believes he would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job'

Consular assistance was provided to the men, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says.

After investigations, they had agreed to pay a fine of Rp 60 million ($A5670), airport spokesman Syaifullah Siregar said.

'Yes, they have admitted their mistake and are ready to pay the fine as per our regulations,' he said.

'But before paying the fine, we still must wait for a security clearance.'

Air force spokesman Brigadier General Hadi Tjahjanto says the clearance should take 24 hours.

With the fine paid and the clearance issued, the Australians will be free to go.

'When we forced down the plane, they didn't have several documents,' he said.

He said they need a security clearance issued by Air Force Headquarters and a flight clearance from the Aviation Transportation Directorate General.

'When all the requirements needed for those clearances are complete, it will only take a day to be issued, depending on the requirements they have.'

The plane's owner, Mr MacLean, is an experienced pilot and used-aircraft salesman who operates Australian Aircraft Sales in South Australia.

His wife, Kaye, said he had completed aircraft deliveries around the world and understood the airspace permissions required, suggesting the incident could be a simple paperwork mishap.

'I think there's a misunderstanding,' she told Fairfax Media.

Small aircraft are commonly sold internationally and delivered by air, but airspace permissions are required when flying through a country's territory. 

Indonesian airforce spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto said the plane came to their attention when it was flying over Timor-Leste - south of the Asian country.

'The plane violated the official path around Saumlaki,' First Marshall Hadi told AAP, referring to a town in Maluku.

'Because they're civilians, the case will be under the authority of airport authorities.

'For now they can't fly, we're waiting until the results of this investigation.'

Violating Indonesian airspace carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $200,000 fine, Fairfax Media reports. 

Mr MacLean had owned the aircraft since 2006. 

His wife Kaye believes Mr MacLean would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job'.

'I think there's a misunderstanding.'
