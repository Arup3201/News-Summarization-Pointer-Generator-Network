This couple will have an awesome picture to include in their wedding invitations - as long as the photographer who unknowingly snapped their proposal can track them down. 

Photographer Dan McGeorge was photographing the Hotel del Coronado in southern California on January 31 when a magical rainbow appeared in full over the resort. 

As he was packing up to leave, a couple approached him and said they just got engaged.  So he took a picture with their camera, wished them well and went on his way.

It wasn't until later that he realized that he had photographed the couple as the boyfriend was proposing in one of his landscape shots of the hotel.

Even more amazing: Photographer Dan McGeorge took this picture of the Hotel del Coronado in Southern California on January 31. He later realized that he captured a couple proposing on the beach

Happy moment: McGeorge has launched a campaign in hopes of finding the mystery couple he captured getting engaged

Now McGeorge has started an online campaign to find the couple so he can give them the picture as a present. 

He has posted the picture on Facebook with a zoomed in view of the couple on the beach, holding each other in the tender moment. 

'People have shared it all over the world and hopefully I can find them and connect with them,' McGeorge told Fox 5.
