Theresa May yesterday pledged to release every government document relating to the Hillsborough disaster to help victims' families get to the truth about the tragedy.

She spoke during an emotional Commons debate, which was called after almost 140,000 signed a petition calling for full public disclosure, 22 years after 96 Liverpool fans died in the tragedy.

One Liverpool Labour MP called on David Cameron to issue an apology for the 'misinformation' and cover-ups over the disaster, just as he had done for Bloody Sunday.

The Mail has recently highlighted the Hillsborough families' long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed. Yesterday all 96 names of the crush victims were read to the House.

Relatives are particularly keen to learn about briefings South Yorkshire Police gave then prime minister Margaret Thatcher during a visit to the Sheffield Wednesday stadium the day after.

The Home Secretary restated the Government's position is a 'commitment to full transparency about the Hillsborough disaster through full public disclosure'.

She apologised for any anxiety caused by the decision to oppose a Freedom of Information request from a BBC reporter but it was right that the families, and not the wider public, should receive the information first as they needed to be treated with 'dignity and respect'.

'Let me say here and now, in this House and on the record, that as Home Secretary I will do everything in my power to ensure the families and the public get the truth,' she told MPs.

'As a Government we fully support the Hillsborough Independent Panel and the process the panel is leading to disclose the documents telling the whole story. No government papers will be withheld from the panel, no attempts to suppress publication will be made, no stone left unturned.'

But she said there may be some redactions, including the names of some junior civil servants and the details of the victims’ confidential medical files.

Labour's Steve Rotheram, a former lord mayor of Liverpool, used the debate to attack the 'smears' and 'establishment cover-up' which led to fans initially being blamed for the 1989 disaster.

He added: 'I call on the Prime Minister to make a statement in this House and apologise for the mistakes that were made and the mishandling of this whole tragedy on behalf of a previous government. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, we will never stop fighting for justice for the 96.'

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said all of the papers on the tragedy have already been handed over to the Hillsborough Independent Panel.

The panel, chaired by Bishop of Liverpool James Jones, was set up to look at the options for creating an archive of Hillsborough material and ensuring the maximum possible public disclosure of the information.

The Prime Minister's spokesman said it was a matter for the panel to decide when to pass on the official documents to the Hillsborough families or to publish them more widely.

Trevor Hicks, the president of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, said they wanted to ensure there was full disclosure of the government documents and there would be 'no possibility that the shutters will come down'.

He said the Sunday morning meeting between Mrs Thatcher and South Yorkshire Police was crucial as it appeared to mark the start of the 'scurrilous' reports that fans were partially responsible.
