Benefits cheats will be forced to repay taxpayers’ money more quickly after it emerged five fraudsters claimed almost £750,000.

Ministers named and shamed those responsible for stealing the largest amounts from the public purse with a vow that benefit fraud will not be tolerated.

Among those jailed in the last year are a mother who claimed her children were disabled when they were appearing in West End shows and auditioning for Britain’s Got Talent and a man who said he was too sick to get a job caught working as a builder and riding elephants in India.

Amanda Webber was jailed for four years after receiving £363,250 in benefits, claiming her children had dozens of physical and mental problems including poor co-ordination, lack of spatial awareness, difficulties walking, unclear speech and a fear of crowds

‪Tougher rules are being introduced in an attempt to further claimants from committing benefit fraud and ensure stolen money is returned on top of any fine or custodial sentence handed out by the courts.

It means that if a fraudster is still living on benefits, up to 40 per cent of their cash can be taken to repay what they stole.

Up to 40 per cent of wages can also be deducted straight from a claimant’s pay packet.

Bailiffs will also be used to confiscate expensive gadgets, jewellery and possessions from convicted benefit cheats.

Illegal immigrant Bola Taiwo Olayeni, 49, living in London, used a stolen identity to claim £119,000

The Department for Work and Pensions released details of what it said were the five biggest fraud cases where the claimant has been jailed in the last year.

Amanda Jane Webber, 43, of Isaacs Lane, Hayward’s Heath, was jailed for four years on 23 May 2013 at Lewes Crown Court.

She received £363,250 in benefits in total, claiming her children had dozens of physical and mental problems including poor co-ordination, lack of spatial awareness, difficulties walking, unclear speech and a fear of crowds.

In reality, they were high achievers who attended private school and had performed in West End shows such as Oliver!, Billy Elliot and Les Miserables.

Four of the supposedly disabled children had joined two siblings to audition for the television show Britain’s Got Talent under the name the Von Webbers.

Illegal immigrant Bola Taiwo Olayeni, 49, living in London, was sentenced on 14 January this year to four years imprisonment, two to be served on license.

She pleaded guilty to fraudulently claiming a total of nearly £119,000 by stealing the identity of a UK citizen.

She used the new ID to fraudulently claim Income Support and Housing and Council Tax Benefits.

Stephen Worton, 55, from Hill Street, 
Liverpool, claimed £88,800 in Disability Living Allowance for people too 
sick to work, but he was found working as a builder and roofing 
contractor.

Pictures also emerged of him on expensive holidays, including riding an elephant in Goa. ‪

Mother-of-seven Cleo Embley was overpaid £94,063 in various benefits while Stephen Worton, claimed £88,800 in Disability Living Allowance for people to sick too work, but he was found working as a builder and roofing contractor

Cleo Embley, 37, from Bridge St, Rishton, was branded Britain's most brazen benefits cheat after it emerged she had claimed the cash by pretending to be single when she was actually living with her partner and father of her children.

She claimed £94,000 in Income Support and Housing and Council Tax Benefits, but after being caught was handed a 22-week prison sentence at Burnley Crown Court.

Welfare minister Lord Freud said the government was determined to claw back more money from fraudsters

Victoria Tracey, 33, from Hathaway Road, Liverpool, got a nine-month prison sentence on 17 January this year for lying about living with her partner, who was also her landlord.

Amazingly she initially denied that her was the father of her children, until investigators pointed out he had tattoos of their names on his arm.

Tracey pleaded guilty to falsely claiming £80,500 while going on two expensive cruises and admitting that her Housing Benefit went towards her partner’s mortgage. ‪

‪Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said: ‘Benefit fraud is deplorable and these five examples show that we won’t tolerate it.

‘Our fraud teams investigate suspected cheats and we have toughened the rules to ensure that convicted fraudsters don’t just face criminal prosecution, but that we make sure stolen money is paid back in larger amounts so we recover it more quickly.’

Figures this week showed Jobseeker’s Allowance and Income Support fraud and error overpayments have fallen to lowest recorded levels.

New figures show fraud and error in the benefits system stands at £3.3billion, down £130million, or 2 per cent of the total welfare bill.
