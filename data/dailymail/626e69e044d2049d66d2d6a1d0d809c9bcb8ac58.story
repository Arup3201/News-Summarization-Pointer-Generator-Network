When Timour Wielemans' £400 mountain bike was stolen two days before he went away to university, he thought he'd never see it again.

The 18-year-old, who faced a 90-minute walk home after his bike was taken on Wednesday, had just one day left working in Cambridge before starting university in Warwick.

But yesterday he was back at work, selling punting tickets just where his locked bike had been stolen from, when he spotted a youth cycling past on his bike.

Timour Wielemans, pictured running, centre, saw a youth pedal past on his bike a day after it was stolen

While one of Timour's colleagues called the police, left, the Belgian student remonstrated with the man riding it

Timour, pictured to the left of the cyclist, said: 'He didn't look too clever but he did look pretty aggressive'

And instead of looking nervous, he was chatting coolly on his mobile as he freewheeled past. 

Timour said: 'I was on the street selling tickets for the punts when I saw him.  I was shocked, then I realised I had to do something.

'I just dropped everything and ran after him and stopped the bike.  I asked him 'Did you steal my bike?'

'He probably didn't expect me to see him.

'He was about 100metres away from where the bike was stolen from.'

Colleagues from the punting company gave chase, too, and helped Timour grab his bike back while one called police.

The student, who is from Belgium, said: 'He didn't look too clever but he did look pretty aggressive and quite angry.

'If my colleagues hadn't turned up, he could have hit me.'  

The man on the bike, whom Timour said looked 'quite angry', was chatting on his phone when he was spotted

Got it back! The student was on the last day of his holiday job before going away to university in Warwick

He gave chase and caught him and challenged him as work colleagues joined him in support and called police. 

Meanwhile a local photographer took these pictures. 

The suspect fled before a police officer arrived, but said she recognised the man in the photographs.

Timour added: 'The PCSO thought at first that maybe he had the same bike as me, but then she saw the pictures of him.

'She knew who he was and said: "Yep, he's a bike thief, that's definitely your bike".'

A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Police said enquiries into the incident were ongoing.
