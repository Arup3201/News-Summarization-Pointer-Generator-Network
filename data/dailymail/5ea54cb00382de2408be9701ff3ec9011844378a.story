A new biography makes the startling claim that Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger purposely kept Steve Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before his company bought the animation studio. 

Iger learned that Job's cancer had returned half an hour before Disney announced it was buying Jobs' Pixar studio in 2006.

But in an extraordinary show of faith the CEO of Disney decided to keep the Apple co-founder's condition a secret for three years, according to a new biography of Jobs obtained by Bloomberg.

Secret pact: Steve Jobs, right, talks with Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger at an Apple media event in 2006, a new book makes the startling claim that  Iger purposely kept Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before buying Jobs' Pixar

Confession: On the day of the deal in 2006, the pair found a secluded spot on the Pixar campus in Emeryville, California, pictured, where Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back

In the book titled 'Becoming Steve Jobs' by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, due to be published on March 24, details emerged of the business pact that made Jobs' Disney's largest shareholder.

Iger reasoned that Disney's $7 billion deal for Pixar was not about Jobs or his medical condition so it did not need to be disclosed, according to the biography.

The book details how Iger told Jobs: 'You're our largest shareholder, but I don't think that makes this matter. You're not material to this deal. We're buying Pixar, we're not buying you.'

Jobs, the prolific co-founder of Apple, was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003. He underwent surgery to remove it in 2004, but the tumor returned and he had a liver transplant in 2009.

The book details how on January 24, 2006, the proposed day of the deal, Iger was at Pixar's headquarters for the ceremony when Jobs asked to go for a private walk. 

As the pair found a secluded spot on the campus in Emeryville, California, Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back. 

Secret: Iger, right, reasoned that the $7 billion deal was on the value of Pixar, not Jobs, left, or his medical condition, so, after consulting a lawyer, the deal went ahead

Iger said Job's confided: 'Frankly, they tell me I've got a 50-50 chance of living five years.'

Iger added: 'So I look at my watch and we've got 30 minutes. In 30 minutes, we're going to make this announcement. We've got television crews, we've got the board votes, we've got investment bankers. 

Pixar is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California.

It is best known for its CGI-animated feature films and has produced fourteen feature films, beginning with Toy Story in 1995. 

The firm, established in February 1986, has become a powerhouse animation studio for Disney, responsible for hits like Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Brave and Monsters, Inc.

Additionally, the studio has earned 15 Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and eleven Grammy Awards.

'The wheels are turning. And I'm thinking, 'We're in this post Sarbanes-Oxley world, and Enron and fiduciary responsibility, and he is going to be our largest shareholder and I'm now being asked to bury a secret.'  

Up until that point, only Jobs' wife Lauren Powell and his doctor knew he had cancer.

According to excerpts from the book, after Jobs' revelation, Iger asked Alan Braverman, Disney's top lawyer for advice. Braverman quickly agreed that Disney could go ahead with the acquisition. So the deal was done. 

However, just three years later, Jobs took a medical leave of absence.

Iger said: 'In that three-year period, I always knew exactly what was going on with Steve medically. He and I would talk all the time, and since I kept things secret he confided in me.'

The book, which will be published on Tuesday, paints a more sympathetic picture than the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson, which focused on  Jobs' messy personal life and tough temperament.

The Apple co-founder died in October 2011.
