Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford has pulled out of Sunday's Sainsbury's Anniversary Games in central London as a precaution ahead of the Commonwealth Games.

The 27-year-old pulled out of last weekend's Glasgow Grand Prix at Hampden Park after suffering a knee problem in warm-up and announced on Thursday night he did not want to risk returning too soon.

'Sadly I wont be jumping this weekend in London. Precautionary decision with the Commonwealth Games being so close,' the Milton Keynes athlete said on Twitter.

Rutherford suffered a nerve irritation in the back of a knee in Glasgow, which denied him the chance to compete in the stadium he hopes to be going for gold in later this month.
