The disappearance of Mikaeel Kular  sparked a major ground, air and sea search in Edinburgh. His mother Rosdeep Adekoya is alleged to have murdered him and then hidden the body

The mother of three-year-old Mikaeel Kular has appeared in court accused of murdering her son.

Rosdeep Adekoya, 34, is charged with assaulting Mikaeel at her Edinburgh home in January and hiding his body in woodland in Fife.

It is alleged she attempted to defeat the ends of justice by pretending to police he had gone missing, sparking a major search by the emergency services and members of the public.

Ms Adekoya appeared before judge Lord Boyd at the High Court in Edinburgh today. The Crown allege that she murdered her son after assaulting him on various occasions between January 12 and January 15.

Prosecutors also claim that she attempted to defeat the ends of justice by telling lies to police officers who were investigating her child’s disappearance.

Ms Adekoya, whose address was given in legal documents as being a prisoner of the prison of Cornton Vale in Stirlingshire, did not enter a plea during the two minute long hearing.

She was dressed in black, wore glasses and sat beside two security officers during proceedings.

Prosecutors allege that on various occasions between January 12 and January 15 at her flat, Ms Adekoya assaulted her three-year-old son by repeatedly seizing hold of him and repeatedly punching him on the head and body.

It is claimed that her actions caused his body to strike against a hard object and that she inflicted blunt force injuries on his head and body.

Prosecutors also claim that she failed to seek medical attention for him and that she murdered him.

The second charge alleges that between January 14 and January 17 2014, at the Edinburgh address and an area of woodland behind a house in Kirkcaldy, Fife, and at Drylaw Police Office in Edinburgh, Ms Adekoya attempted to defeat the ends of justice.

Prosecutors allege that she did this in a bid to avoid being detected, arrested and prosecuted for the crime.

She is alleged to have wrapped Mikaeel's body in a duvet cover, put it in a suitcase and driven to Fife, where prosecutors say she hid the case under a bush in woods behind a house.

She is alleged to have reported her son missing to police, telling officers he got out of bed and climbed on a stool to unlock the front door of his home.

Prosecutors say she did this and caused a police investigation to be launched into his disappearance and that a major search was then made for him which involved police officers, members of the fire service, the coastguard, the mountain rescue, air support and members of the public.

Today prosecution lawyer Alex Prentice QC 
told the court that there had been discussions between the Crown and Ms 
Adekoya’s legal representatives.

Mr 
Prentice said that these discussions were on going and asked for the 
case to be continued to a hearing at Edinburgh High Court later this 
month.

Ms Adekoya’s defence advocate 
Brian McConnachie told the court that he wouldn’t be entering a plea at 
this stage on his client’s behalf.

He added: 'It would be of assistance to parties that a plea is not entered at this stage.'

Lord Boyd allowed the case to continue at the end of proceedings on Tuesday. The case against Ms Adekoya will next call at the High Court in Edinburgh on July 25.
