Princess Eugenie has flown back from America to revisit the hospital where she underwent spinal surgery at age 12.

Reflecting the spring weather, Princess Eugenie wore bright turquoise to open the new Children's High Dependency Unit at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital today.

She underwent an eight hour surgery in 2002 to correct scoliosis and is now a patron of the hospital's charity redevelopment appeal, which has helped fund the new unit.

Princess Eugenie chose a bright outfit to match the sunshine for the visit, emphasising her slim figure with a cinched in waist

The princess met  Caitlin Kydd (12 year old Sarcoma patient) and her parents Jake and Alison Kydd

During the visit, Eugenie unveiled a plaque to officially open the new unit, watched by Professor Anthony Goldstone, hospital officials and patients, before touring the wards and meeting patients.

Having been admitted to the hospital herself, Eugenie could easily emphasise with the children currently undergoing treatment, talking in depth and sharing hugs with patients and their families.

Eugenie’s major surgery at 12 meant she needed to spend three days in intensive care at the hospital.

The new unit, which will treat over 400 children a year, will allow parents to sleep next to their children, something not possible at the time of Eugenie’s operation.

While the young princess went on to make a complete recovery, the experience has clearly stayed with her.

Speaking at the event, the Express reports Eugenie said: ‘Going into hospital is nerve-wracking for any child; I can still vividly remember how nervous I felt in the days and weeks leading up to my operation.

‘Anything that can be done to ease these worries and make the environment better for patients is to be welcomed.

The princess spoke of memories of her own surgery, saying she was nervous for weeks beforehand

The princess flew back from New York, where she is working at an auction house, sometime last week to open the unit

‘This purpose-built unit will enable specialist teams to concentrate on improving the condition of their patients so that they can return to the ward after their operation as soon as possible.

‘I am sure it will greatly enhance the care and experience of the hospital’s young patients and their families.’

The 24-year-old princess is believed to have returned to the UK some time in the last week for the visit from New York where she is working for the online auction company Paddle8.

Showing no signs of jet lag, Eugenie looked glowing in her sleeveless summer dress, pulled in with a  tribal print belt.

She completed the elegant look with a pair of nude high heels.

Just last week the princess attended The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson and her daughter attended the Gavel & Grand Benefit Auction at the glamourous Bowery Hotel.
