A property developer has won a £167,000 legal battle with 11 of her neighbours after she became embroiled in a bitter boundary dispute - over a 9ft piece of land.

Valerie Wright, 56, claims she was subjected to a vicious seven-year hate campaign at the hands of villagers living in picturesque Southrey, Lincolnshire, over the the small strip of grass.

The mother-of-one moved onto two acres of land with her husband William - who has since died -  in 1990 where they built two houses, one of which they moved into into 2006.

Victory: Valerie Wright, 56, claims she was subjected to a seven-year hate campaign to reclaim her land

Dispute: The nine-foot strip of land between her house (left) and her neighbours' consists mainly of weeds

But since 2007 she has been locked in a turf war with locals over a small strip of grass behind her home - consisting mainly of nettles and a ditch.

She took fellow villagers to Lincoln County Court after deciding they were trespassing on her £270,000 detached property.

Those she challenged claimed they did nothing wrong and that the boundary was clearly marked on the deeds of their homes on Ferry Road.

But following a lengthy row over the tiny plot of land six families have been forced to stump up £167,000 in damages and court costs following her victory.

The dispute has shrunk each of their gardens by 9ft and every single penny of Mrs Wright’s £3,650 damages and her £92,000 legal costs has now been paid by them.

Additionally, the residents she challenged in the leafy village have also had to settle their own legal costs of at least £72,000.

Anger: While she claimed residents were trespassing, they claimed she was making them cut their gardens

The court heard how the money has been paid through a combination of selling up, taking out loans, or claiming on home insurance.

Today, Mrs Wright, a building project manager, who has since used some of the payout to erect a sturdy fence to reinforce the boundary, said: 'I claimed back what was rightfully mine.

'This was and is my property and looking at the Land Registry records proved that.

'We came to the village in 1990 and all we wanted was a quiet life - we had everything but that.

'I have been on the receiving end of a fair bit of animosity and have been the victim of a nasty hate campaign. I would say I have been harassed by some members of this community.

'They even held meetings in the village hall to discuss my land, I was very much ganged up on.

'I claimed back what was rightfully mine. I have been harassed by some members of this community'

'The problem is that if we had ever wanted to sell up we had people on our property.

'My solicitor wrote to them in 2007 telling them to get off my land.

'A summons was issued in 2010 and even after that they still had the chance to back down.

'I have lived in the parish all my life and the action I took was justified. It took seven years because there was six properties but I’ve finally done it.

'I’m just happy to be left alone and move on with my life, just live and let live and mind my own business.'

Mrs Wright and husband William, who died in 2011, had claimed neighbours from nearby Ferry Road had had extended their gardens onto her land 'without licence or consent'.

But Lincoln County Court heard that the defiant local residents still 'refused to withdraw'

Two years ago successfully argued that the true boundary - once marked by a wire fence - lies about 4ft to the east of a dyke running parallel with Ferry Road.

Jeffrey Withey, 66, of Ferry Road, said: 'We had done nothing wrong, but unfortunately the court has decided and we are out of pocket and garden space.

Mrs Wright and her late husband bought the land in Southrey, Lincolnshire, in 1990

'It was a nice village when we came 20-something years ago, but now we want to move. We used to trim the hedges and tend to it and she just wants to build on it.

'Two of the couples involved have already moved out and I want to as well to be honest. I have lost my apple and pear tree because of this.

'We’ve felt driven off our land - even if it is a couple of metres - but its the principle that counts.

'We had paperwork showing our land went down to the old fence.'

His wife Jacqueline said: 'I could not understand how the deeds were wrong.

'This house has been here for 100 years, but the deeds are not worth the paper they are printed on.'

Neighbour and former parish councillor Mike McKenna added: 'The boundary is marked out on the deeds and it is a mystery to me how it got to this stage.'
