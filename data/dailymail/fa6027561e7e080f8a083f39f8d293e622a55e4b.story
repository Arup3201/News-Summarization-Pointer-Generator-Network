I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here runner-up Jake Quickenden turned down a move re-start his football career with Conference North side Gainsborough Trinity.

The reality TV star, who originally shot to fame as a contestant on the X Factor, was a youth-team player with his hometown club Scunthorpe United.

A statement from Quickenden's representatives read: 'After being approached by Gainsborough Trinity Jake has politely declined their offer. I can confirm however that Jake has been approached by other football clubs and his management are in talks with them. Right now his focus is on his music and presenting.'  

Singer Jake Quickenden was a contestant on the 2012 and 2014 series of the X Factor

The 26-year-old was also the runner-up in in the latest I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! series

The 26-year-old also played at non-league level with Frickley Athletic and Bottesford Town but is clearly hooked on pursuing a career in the music industry having appeared on X Factor in the 2012 and 2014 series. 

'He's a talented footballer. It's not like he's someone who's not kicked a ball before,' Gainsborough Trinity manager Steve Housham told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.

Perhaps Quickenden was inspired to a return to football having spent time in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity with former Wigan, Fulham and West Ham midfielder Jimmy Bullard.

'The chairman is an ambitious guy and wants to get him down for a game,' Housham added.

'There are still a lot of dealings to go through, but it could be a case of getting him down before the end of the season.'

Gainsborough are currently 15th in the Conference North Table, which is a division five steps below the Premier League.

Gainsborough Trinity manager Steve Housham confirmed the club are in talks with Quickenden
