Lynda Bellingham's widower has said his wife had 'sobbed her heart out' before she died as she failed to get acting work because people 'wouldn't give a job to a Loose Woman'.

The 66-year-old, who died of bowel cancer in October, believed her regular four-year spot on the ITV show 'marred her career', her husband Michael Pattemore said.

Ms Bellingham decided to 'get the hell out' of Loose Women as her acting career faltered, only to become terminally ill, Mr Pattemore said.

Upset: Lynda Bellingham said being on Loose Women 'marred' her acting career and kept her out of work, her husband Michael has said 

Her husband Michael, 59, who carried her coffin with her sons in Somerset on November 3, told Woman's Own: 'She felt typecast by them and felt they marred her career, preventing her from getting the acting jobs she really wanted. 

'Though it was hugely successful, Lynda wanted to be seen as an actress.'

He said that she was frustrated by the lack of acting parts she was offered in the years before her death.

Her sadness was compounded when she was handed a starring role in Kay Mellor's play A Passionate Woman last year, but then had to pull out to get treatment for her bowel cancer. 

Mr Pattemore said: 'Once, we were at a party on a yacht and Lynda was talking to a respected writer. She asked him, 'Why won't you give me a job?'

'He turned to her and said, "My dear - I can't give a job to a Loose Woman." Later I found Lynda sobbing her heart out. She said to me, "Michael, I've got to get the hell out." And that's what she did. That's why she left the show.'

Lynda Bellingham's final television appearance was on Loose Women, where she was a panel member for four years.

In a poignant final interview she described the Christmas she would never have with family and why she had decided to stop her cancer treatment. 

She was given a standing ovation as she entered the studio and went on to say how she wished to be remembered, adding as you know I wanted to win an Oscar at 75 for Best Newcomer! Sadly that's gone out of the window.'

Her fellow Loose Woman Coleen Nolan later revealed that it was only when Lynda became ill she got lots of acting offers again.

She said: 'One of the things Lynda said to me was 'You know darling, you have to be dying to get any acting parts. I've been offered so many parts since I got ill.'

The actress, best known for her long-running role as the mother in the Oxo TV adverts, died last month after battling colon cancer.

Her death sparked an outpouring of grief and her funeral, packed with celebrities, was so full mourners paid their respects in the grounds of St Bartholomew's Church in Crewkerne, Somerset.

During the service her sons read a letter from their mother, in which she said she knew they would feel 'cross' and 'abandoned' because she chose to end her chemotherapy but said 'it was probably the only thing I had left to myself'.

Mr Pattemore also read a poem Lynda had written about their relationship which said: 'As I always tell you in my own way, I love you Michael Pattemore there is nothing more I can say'.

He burst into tears and said: 'I love you too Lynda' and told the congregation today was the tenth anniversary of the day they met for the first time.

Ms Bellingham's husband Michael and her biological sons Michael and Robbie and step-son Bradley then carried her coffin out of the church before hundreds watched as fireworks burst into the autumn sky while she was buried.

During the service packed with celebrities speakers, including Loose Women star Denise Welch, Gyles Brandreth and Christopher Biggins, reminisced with jokes, verse and anecdotes as they fondly remembered 'brave, beautiful, brilliant, funny, fabulous Lynda' and her 'honking laughter'.
