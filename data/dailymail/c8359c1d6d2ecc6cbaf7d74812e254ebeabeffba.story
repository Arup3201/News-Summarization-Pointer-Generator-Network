An 89-year-old tennis ace has revealed his long and successful sporting career was a cover for his life as a spy.

Fred Kovaleski, now one of the world's oldest tennis players, has opened up for the first time about his past working for the C.I.A.

The New Yorker's tennis talent won him a college scholarship, and before long he was traveling overseas for a tennis match representing the United States.

During an obligatory meeting with the U.S. Counselor of Embassy in Egypt, he received an offer to work undercover for the C.I.A.

He said he got the job without ever seeking it out.

'I spoke Polish and Russian - still do - and Russia at that time was a serious enemy of ours,' he told CBS New York.

He adding that tennis was 'absolutely' his cover.

Kovaleski, who played Wimbledon in 1950, spent time in Egypt playing pro-tennis.

But as a CIA agent, his job was also to recruit other agents.

'We were really looking for information on how they operated,' he said, referring to the Russians.

In 1961, after a decade working as a spy, Kovaleski decided to leave the life of a secret agent behind him.

By that stage he had a wife, Monya, and a son, and he took a full-time job with Pepsi-Cola, which lent itself more to family life.

Now, 53 years later, much has changed but the 89-year-old is still playing tennis.

'I'm probably the best 85 and older in the world, and I'm going over to Europe in another two days to play in the world championships,' he told the TV station.

Kovaleski, who turns 90 in October, is considered the 13th best player in the world.

And while he has an ace story to tell about his life in the C.I.A., he said that had there been money in tennis back then, he would have left the spying to 007.
