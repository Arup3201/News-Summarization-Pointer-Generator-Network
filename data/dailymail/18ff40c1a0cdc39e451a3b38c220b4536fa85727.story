This is the adorable moment Japan's famously fearsome sumo wrestlers dropped their battle-ready faces for some public play time with their babies.

The mighty men proudly show off their little ones, kissing them and playing in the sun, before stepping into the ring at the 'Honozumo' tournament in Tokyo.

Thousands of spectators watched the sumo wrestlers put on a show, but not before the fierce warriors showed off their tender paternal side at the Yasukuni Shine precinct.

The ancient martial art form is a spectacle to behold, to be sure, but nothing quite compares with seeing such enormous men cradling the tiniest of people.
