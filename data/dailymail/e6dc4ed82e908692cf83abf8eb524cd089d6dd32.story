The seven-time Italian Prime Minister was accused of using political cunning to help the Mafia

The former Italian prime minister who laid the ambush that brought down Margaret Thatcher over the European single currency has died, aged 94.

Giulio Andreotti, who was known for his Machiavellian style of politics, plotted with other European leaders to mount a surprise attack on Baroness Thatcher at a 1990 summit.

The talks were a catastrophe, which set in motion the chain of events that led to her resignation.

The seven-time premier died at home in Rome yesterday, after a long illness.

At the Rome summit of 1990 the European Monetary Union was high on the agenda and Thatcher’s prophetic voice was alone against it.

Thatcher was fundamentally opposed to the Euro because there was no history of a successful currency union without a political union. But, effectively ambushed by the 11 other head of states, she was trapped.

Boris Johnson later described it as ‘a blood-curdling scene.’ He remembered: ‘Thatch was backed into a corner — a minority of one — as they all piled into her.’ 

Within days, Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe resigned over her handling of EU relations and his dramatic speech was the key catalyst for the leadership challenge by Michael Heseltine.

This was followed soon after by her own resignation.

After Baroness Thatcher’s death last month, Gianni De Michelis, Andreotti’s foreign minister, remembered how the Italians plotted to bring her down.

He said: ‘In September 1990, we, Italy, who had the presidency of the EU, decided on her political downfall.

‘She was convinced of her arguments and she thought she was better than other people and would therefore get the result she wanted. In general this was true but not this time.’

The Iron Lady later described Andreotti having ‘a positive aversion to principles’.

At his prime, Andreotti, known as the Godfather of Italian politics, was one of the country’s most powerful men.

He helped draft the country’s 
constitution after World War II, sat in parliament for 60 years. ‘Power 
wears out ... those who don’t have it,’ he once famously said.

But he was a controversial figure who was tainted by corruption scandals and accused of aiding the Mafia.

He was tainted by his friendship with Roberto Calvi, the Vatican-linked financier known as God’s Banker, who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982.

Both men were said to be members of P2, a secret Masonic lodge to which hundreds of Italian politicians, businessmen, secret service agents, policemen, civil servants and others belonged.

In 2002, in what was dubbed the trial of the century Andreotti was convicted of ordering the murder of an Italian journalist.

And he was accused of exchanging a ‘kiss of honour’ with the mafia’s long-time No. 1 boss.

Prosecutors alleged Andreotti granted favours for the Sicilian Cosa Nostra in exchange for their delivering votes for his party.

He was eventually cleared. but suspicion and scandal stuck, as well as a host of grimy nicknames including the Black Pope and Beelzebub.

A character in the Godfather film series was based on him.

Andreotti always denied the charges, again maintaining he was a victim of mob bosses intent on taking revenge for his fight against the Mafia.
