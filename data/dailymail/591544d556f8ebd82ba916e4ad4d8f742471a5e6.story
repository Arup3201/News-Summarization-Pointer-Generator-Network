Samsung has filed a design patent for wearable computer glasses that are tethered to a smartphone.

The Samsung spectacle plugs into a mobile phone and displays information such as text messages and phone calls.

Unlike Google Glass, which is wireless, the Wall Street Journal reports that Samsung’s design will be attached using a micro-USB connection.

This attachment could overcome one of the biggest problems of Google Glass; battery life.

By drawing power from a smartphone’s battery, Samsung’s design could potentially have a longer life and be lighter than Google’s version.

The patent says that the device will allow users to ‘take phone calls and listen to music during workouts’.

While Samsung may be attempting to steal Google Glass' thunder, there are reports that Google is working on developing a internet-enabled watch that could be unveiled 'in weeks'.

The watch, believed to be codenamed Gem, could take advantage of the work Google has been doing on its Glass wearable computer.

It could also use the same Google Now alerts for directions and text messages as the eyewear.

In August, it was revealed the firm bought a company called WIMM, which makes a watch that runs on Google’s Android software.

The design also integrates ear phones into the frame, so users won’t need separate buds to listen to music. 

Samsung calls its design a ‘sports glass’ which means the company doesn’t expect it to be worn all day.

The main downside, however, is users will be constantly attached to a cable, and that could be a deal breaker for many.

If Samsung releases its spectacles, it will be the latest in a series of efforts by the South Korean company to break into the wearable technology market. 

The device could follow the launch of its Galaxy Gear smartwatch, which was unveiled in September.

Samsung has gone back to the drawing board for its second-generation Galaxy Gear smartwatch after sales of the original model, pictured, were slow. Reports from Korea claim the Galaxy Gear 2 will replace the chunky flat screen of the original with a curved OLED display and is set to look 'totally different'

Meanwhile, Microsoft is thought to be preparing to launch its own version of Google Glass based on its experience in the gaming world.

The Verge reports that the company filed patent applications for head-mounted displays that related to video games.

Some experts claim that, more than anything, price point is going to be the way to differentiate a Microsoft and Samsung glass product from their competition at Google.

Google Glass is expected to retail for about $1,500 making it a luxury product rather than a device available to a wider audience.
