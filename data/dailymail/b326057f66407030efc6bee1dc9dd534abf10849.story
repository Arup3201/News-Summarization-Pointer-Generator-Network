Police have raced to the home of hate preacher Anjem Choudary and evacuated his family to protect them from attack, it emerged today.

Officers helped them flee their East London terraced house after threats from people wanting vengeance for the Woolwich murder of Lee Rigby.

Choudary, who believes that 'war monger' David Cameron's 'crusade' in Afghanistan is turning young British Muslims to terrorism, allowed his wife and children to be rushed to a car and whisked away to a secret location at around 2pm yesterday.

Help: Critics say the police should stop Choudary's hate-filled speeches on the internet, rather than running up costs protecting his family from threats following the Woolwich terror

Evacuation: A member of Choudary's family carries two pink bags before the children are ushered out as police shut the property's door

Baby: A woman, believed to be Anjem Choudary's wife, is escorted from the house by a female police officer, while carrying a young child

Two Scotland Yard officers then stood guard at the property for several hours afterwards.

Choudary himself was not at home, with a neighbour saying he had left the property earlier that morning.

Scotland Yard today refused to discuss the operation, but it is understood that it was linked to a threat of violence.

A group called Britain First posted a video message online calling on police to arrest Anjem Choudary by 6pm or they would come to detain him themselves.

Members also claimed they knew where he lived and security sources confirmed they decision to move his wife and children was because of safety fears.

Choudary today blamed David Cameron for a 'crusade' against Islam which is turning young British Muslims into potential terrorists.

Aggressive foreign policy in Afghanistan and oppressive tactics employed by police and security organisations in Britain are responsible for isolating British Muslims and leading them to adopt the extreme ideology that results in violent attacks, according to Choudary, who admitted knowing Michael Adebolajo who butchered soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week.

'By ignoring the link between what took place in Woolwich, by blaming Muslims, by trying to silence voices who oppose him and by justifying his rotten foreign policy, David Cameron has foolishly and inadvertently become the biggest radicalising tool for Muslim youth both in the UK and abroad,' he said.

'For the war monger David Cameron and his lackeys to suggest that no one can make such a link is not only complete rubbish but also highly irresponsible.

'After all the British regime is supposedly charged with the security of the British people as opposed to being charged with engaging in some sort of Crusade against Islam and Muslims on the behest of the American regime around the world.'

Yesterday Choudary backtracked on 
comments he previously made about his links with one of Drummer Lee 
Rigby's suspected killers in the face of an MI5 investigation.

Choudary
 said he has not been in touch with murder suspect Michael Adebolajo 
since 'before 2007' after it was revealed MI5 investigators were looking
 into the amount of contact, if any, he had with the two suspects.

But last week Choudary said he last saw him in 2011 and described him as a man of 'impeccable character' in interviews with BBC Newsnight and Channel 4 News.

Refusing to condemn the killers of Lee Rigby, the British drummer crushed by a vehicle and then hacked to death with machetes, Choudary even suggested that ‘one man killed in a street’ was hardly proper vengeance for those killed by ‘Britain and the U.S.' in wars overseas.

On Twitter, Choudary said: 'I can challenge the war monger David Cameron to an open debate on 'Whether Muslims should promote hatred or love against UK Foreign policy?'

'In reality David Cameron is clearly not able give any cogent argument as to why the UK regime continues to follow the US in killing Muslims!'

Meanwhile Michael Adebowale has arrived at court for the first time since being charged with the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby who was hacked to death outside his army barracks in Woolwich last week.

Fallen hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, from Manchester, was described as 'cheeky and humorous' in tributes. He was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich last week

Accused: Michael Adebowale arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday in the back of a police van after being charged with the murder of soldier Lee Rigby

Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, was driven in the back of a police van to Westminster Magistrates' Court, where he also faces a charge of possessing a firearm.

He is due to appear before magistrates this morning

Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism Command said last night they had been authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to charge him over last Wednesday's attack.

His alleged accomplice, Michael Adebolajo, 28, remains in a stable condition in hospital under armed guard, after being shot by police.
