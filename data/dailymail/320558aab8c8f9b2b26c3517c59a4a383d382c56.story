The pretty young girl is so drunk on cheap alcohol she’s lying comatose on a pavement in a torn T-shirt and minuscule shorts on a bitterly cold winter night.

Another staggers along wearing ripped fishnet stockings and shorts that leave little more to the imagination than a lap dancer’s G-string.

A third leans over the pavement on the point of collapse as an unsteady friend grabs her arms in a drunken gesture of solidarity.

Many other young women are supporting each other as they walk to stop themselves falling into the gutter.

No, these are not members of a hen party or a group of silly wannabe WAGS; they are just a few of the hundreds of university students in Liverpool who were out for a night on the town this weekend.

They were ‘enjoying’ — if that is the word — an organised pub crawl laid on by Carnage UK.

The Carnage UK events are run by Varsity Leisure Group, a multi-million-pound business that puts on hundreds of pub crawls throughout Britain, selling souvenir T-shirts for students who partake.

The event, the third in this university year, includes alcoholic drinks for £1 and claims to offer students the 'best night of their lives'

The 'Playboys vs Bunnies' themed event attracted hundreds of revellers who enjoyed drinking cheap alcohol before spilling out into Liverpool's famous Concert Square

Carnage UK events, which are organised by Varsity Leisure Group, have come under fire in the past for promoting excessive drinking

Lured by alcohol from £1 a shot, and the 
promise they would have the ‘best night of their lives’, the students 
were all dressed for the event’s theme of Playboy vs Bunnies — an 
imaginative variant on Carnage UK’s previous parties: Nympho Nurses And 
Dirty Doctors, and Pimps And Hoes (whores). If this is the best night of
 their lives, I shudder to imagine what their worst is.

Why is it that such well-educated young women feel the only way they can have fun and express themselves is by dressing like tarts and drinking themselves into oblivion?

And it’s not just Liverpool — it is happening in university towns throughout the country.

What is it that encourages them to ape the worst behaviour of men? Is there some neo-feminist version of equality that compels them to behave like football hooligans?

Of course, we expect the young to enjoy themselves at university, not least because many of them have left home for the first time and should relish their new-found freedom. We don’t want them all to be bookworms confined in dusty libraries at all hours.

But this kind of drinking, this knock-it-back-until-you-pass-out mentality, seems so utterly nihilistic: devoid of almost any purpose other than getting the next cheap shot.

Sure we used to drink when I was at university, but never like this. It is as if getting annihilated on drink is the only reason to party at campuses today — even for normally sensible, well-educated girls.

The Carnage event held last night in Liverpool was the third in this university year

The peer pressure to conform is intense. And so instead of using university to help define themselves as individuals, to soak up knowledge and wisdom, they revert to a herd mentality.That herd mentality is all too apparent, as well, in the latest drinking craze of NekNomination — in which people post videos of themselves on Facebook and other social media sites, daring others to outdrink them.

It’s a craze that has already claimed a number of lives, and so far it seems to be mainly confined to men, although it can only be a matter of time before girls feel they have to get in on it. 

And whatever anyone says about equality, the plain fact is that drunken women are far more vulnerable than drunken men.

While the drinking appeared to have taken its toll on some party-goers others called it a night and poured into take-away shops for food

As the agony aunt Irma Kurtz said recently, a woman when drunk puts herself at more risk of rape and sexual assaults. She was pilloried for stating the obvious. But if you get drunk with the boys, you are incapable of self-defence.

What chance would that Liverpool lass in our main picture lying drunk in the street have of fending off a man? Would she even remember what happened in the morning?

For educated, career women of my generation, it is unfathomable that those who follow the path we cleared to equality should choose to squander the great privileges they now have. Women outnumber and outperform men at even our top universities. They have the best chance of fulfilling their dreams of any generation.

Yet I don’t know a single boss who would now employ a graduate without first checking their Facebook and social media accounts.

Perhaps these young women might give a thought to their future before so recklessly throwing it away on a moment of drunken madness.
