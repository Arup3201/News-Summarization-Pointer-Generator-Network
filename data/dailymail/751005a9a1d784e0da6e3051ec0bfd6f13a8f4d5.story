It's the new push-up bra that claims to be able to give any woman cleavage, no matter how modest her breasts.

And to substantiate their vow, the Thai lingerie brand Wacoal have launched their Mood Boost-Up Bra alongside a steamy online advert in which a beautiful model blessed with a humble A-cup dances seductively around her bedroom while demonstrating the bra's appeal.

But all is not quite as it might initially appear...

Cleavage for all! The bra claims to be able to enhance even the most modestly-sized chests

As the woman dances in slow motion to the sultry music she begins to take off her clothes... then her make up.... then her shirt... and then her wig, finally revealing to the audience that 'she' is actually a man.

The video, available on YouTube, has had almost 3m hits on YouTube, with many viewers shocked by the denouement, which reiterates that the bra really can give anyone cleavage. Even men.
