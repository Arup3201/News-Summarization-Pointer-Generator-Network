At first glance, these dishes look like everyday Japanese favourites. But look a little closer and it's clear there's something rather unusual about this food.

The culinary works of art are the creation of chefs at the Maplise bakery in Shinjuku, Tokyo - cakes and sweet dishes made to look like bowls of savoury noodle soup and pan-fried dumplings.

And they’re so realistic, it’s almost unnerving.

Unbelievable: This Japanese noodle dish is in fact a cake. The Maplise bakery has covered every intricate detail

What looks like bowls of ramen (hot noodles in soup), gyoza (pan-fried dumplings), and tenshindon (rice wrapped in an omelette) are actually intricately created cakes, as seen on RocketNews.

Meanwhile they resemble fried eggs but another creation is in fact sweet icing garnish, and a sloppy-looking crepe is actually a chocolate cake, and inside the noodles and broth is a soft sponge filling.

Dumplings and soy sauce? No way. Apple pies with jelly are, though you'd never guess
