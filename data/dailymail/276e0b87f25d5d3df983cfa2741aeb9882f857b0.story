The M25 can be a daunting prospect at the best of times, even for a confident young driver.

So it’s perhaps not surprising that 82-year-old Dennis Leighton got rather lost amid its four-lane carriageways and busy junctions.

However, he managed to disappear for an epic 30 hours behind the wheel.

Dennis Leighton was reported missing after failing to arrive at his destination 55 miles away. He was found 30 hours later

Boarded up: Mr Leighton's home in Windsor yesterday

He set off from his home in Windsor on
 Monday evening to visit his daughter Hazel 55 miles away in Swanley in 
Kent. It was a route he apparently knew well and had travelled several 
times before.

A few hours later his worried family 
reported him missing. The next day at 11.20am his silver Vauxhall Astra 
estate was spotted on a police automatic recognition camera in Dartford,
 Kent – six miles from his intended destination.

The M25 celebrated its 25th birthday in October, despite first being proposed in 1905.

It runs for 117 miles and almost encircles Greater London.

When it was first built it was the world's biggest ring road/city bypass but now it is second to the Berlin Ring which is 121 miles long.

The M25 took more than 11 years to complete and cost around £1billion.

If people were to drive at 70mph it would take an hour and 40 minutes to complete the route.

However, those in need of refreshments would need to carefully plan their stops as there are only three service stations along the entire length of the  motorway.

Despite being designed with a capacity of 100,000 vehicles per day, almost double that figure now use it daily.

The motorway inspired Chris Rea's 1989 hit Road to Hell and is also the inspiration behind the name of electronic duo Orbital.

It appeared the former carpenter was 
lost on the 117-mile London orbital and going around in circles. Thames 
Valley Police put out a missing person’s appeal and called on other 
forces to help.

Then in the early hours of Wednesday –
 more than 30 hours after going missing – a ‘confused but grateful’ Mr 
Leighton and his car were found safe in South London.

Neighbours said he
 was in hospital last night, believed to be having treatment for 
hypothermia after his two nights out in the cold in his car.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said:
 ‘He had been driving around the south of the country, predominantly on 
the M25 but had also gone on to some A roads in the area.

He had stopped
 to catch up on some much needed sleep – we think in a motorway service 
area, before setting off again. He is, after all, 82.’

Mr Leighton has lived alone at his 
semi-detached home since the death of his wife Audrey. Milk bottles were
 outside his house yesterday and plywood had been used to board up the 
door after the police broke in during their search.

One neighbour said it was not unusual 
for Mr Leighton to visit his daughter. She added: ‘He goes down to his 
daughter’s every so often, so nobody thought anything about it. He’s a 
lovely man. He’s got one daughter and a grandson born in June.’

Orbital nightmare: Mr Leighton is believed to have spent nearly two days on the M25

Mr Leighton’s adventure echoes that of Mohammed Bellazrak’s three-day ordeal last Christmas.

The grandfather hit the headlines when he fell victim to the airport snow chaos after taking his wife to catch a holiday flight at Gatwick Airport.

The disorientated 72-year-old spent three days and nights driving up and down the M4 motorway trying to find his way home to Trowbridge, Wiltshire.

Mr Bellazrak set off from Trowbridge on December 23 to drive his wife to Heathrow airport where she was due to catch a flight to Morocco.

However, the snow and ice meant the flight was diverted to Gatwick.

He was eventually found on Christmas Day, still at the wheel of his Peugeot 307, when he triggered a police camera and was flagged down by officers in Oxfordshire.

Police cameras had recorded him driving around numerous towns in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.
