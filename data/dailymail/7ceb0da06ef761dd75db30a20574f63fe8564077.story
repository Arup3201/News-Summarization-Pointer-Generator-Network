A third of all women murdered in the U.S. are killed by male partners, a study has revealed.

The further south couples live the more likely women are to be victims of domestic violence.

The Violence Policy Center records which states have the highest number of cases in which one man kills one woman and found that in 2012 Alaska had the highest rate of domestic homicide.  

Southern domestic homicide: A third of women murdered in the United States are done so by their significant other, most of whom live in the south and are allowed to carry a gun 

A recorded total of 2.57 women were killed in Alaska for every 100,000.

Over half of all women who were killed by intimate males between 2001 to 20012 in the United States were killed using a gun, not surprisingly in states with lenient gun policies.

Between 2003 and 2012 Nevada had the highest domestic homicide rate of 2.447 women killed per every 100,000.

Nevada's rate recently dropped to 1.83.

The Huffington Post reports that the numbers of women abused by their partners compared to the number of men is vastly unequal which stifles the myth that men and women abuse alike.

Still problem: Since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994, domestic violence rates have fallen 64 per cent but an average of three women is still killed every day

In 2010, 85 per cent of domestic abuse victims were women and 15 per cent were men.

Between 2003 and 2012 34 per cent of domestic homicides had female victims compared to only 2.5 per cent males.

Over 18,000 women have been killed by male intimate partners since 2003. 

Southern states including Alaska have a tendency to have more lenient gun control laws, something that may indicate the higher numbers of domestic homicide in the Southern states.

According to the website NRA-ILA, a permit to carry a concealed gun is not required in Alaska.

Nor is a permit required to purchase a handgun in the state of Alaska.

Since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994, domestic violence rates have fallen 64 per cent but an average of three women is still killed every day.
