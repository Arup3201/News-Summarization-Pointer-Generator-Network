Nadia Lee, dubbed the 'Pigeon lady of Pimlico' has been found guilty of flouting an Asbo banning her from feeding the birds in her exclusive neighbourhood

A pensioner nicknamed the ‘Pigeon Lady of Pimlico’ has been found guilty of flouting an ASBO banning her from feeding the birds near her home.

Nadia Lee, 67, spent 25 years fattening pigeons in the exclusive London borough, much to the dismay of locals.

She became renowned for scooping stricken birds up into her Gucci handbag and taking them to her £750,000 Georgian maisonette where they are rubbed in lavender in a ‘homeopathy treatment.’

But Lee was slapped with the ASBO after neighbours complained their luxury cars were being peppered with droppings and said the feed was encouraging rats.

Westminster City Council took action in December 2011, banning her from feeding birds in the local area for three years.

But Lee was found to have breached the order on October 14, 2012.

A jury at Southwark Crown Court were unable to agree on two further alleged breaches in July 2012, which were discharged.

Lee, who suffers from multiple personality disorder, was deemed unfit to plead to the charges.

Adjourning sentence for reports, Judge Martin Beddoe said: ‘ASBO or no ASBO, it’s going to be a condition of her bail not to discharge any food stuff in any public place, covered by the area as identified in the existing order.’

Addressing Lee, the judge said: ‘Regressing into a different personality is one thing that has rendered you at least temporarily unfit to be tried, but the extent which you can control your behaviour is another issue.

‘I’m not satisfied there is any evidence you can’t control this behaviour and the court expects you to control it.’

Privately educated Lee, a former secretary and pilot’s daughter, appeared crestfallen as the ruling was passed.

Wearing a bright blue scarf, black fleece jacket, jeans and trainers, she sat in stunned silence before being accompanied out of the court by a friend.

Lee, who suffers multiple personality disorder, was given the ASBO in December 2011 by Westminster Council

Residents in Cumberland Street, Pimlico complained their luxury cars were being peppered with bird droppings, and said the food was attracting rats

When the ASBO was originally granted, Lee said she had turned into a self-styled ‘bin lady’ after her mother’s death two decades ago.

Seven residents and two council officials told how they were unable to enjoy the roof terraces and gardens of their multi-million pound homes because of pigeon dirt.

One neighbour, Austen Iverleigh, complained: ‘She generates squalor on an industrial scale.

‘Whenever I have spoken to her, she has been very polite and I am sure that in any other respect, she is a very nice and reasonable person.

‘The problem is the feeding of pigeons on a huge scale, which causes serious disturbance to those around her. I have seen rats in her basement.’

Lee said she catches the pigeons with a net, which she carries with her,
 before taking them home. She said: 'If they are too injured, I take 
them to a pigeon sanctuary. I love them and they depend on me because I 
have raised them all their lives

Egyptian-born Lee told the court: ‘You cannot rescue pigeons without putting down seed and getting them all together.

‘I then catch them in a net, which I carry with me everywhere I go.

‘Then I put them in Gucci bags hanging off my Mamas & Papas pram. I take them home and take the string off their feet, rub them in lavender and treat them with homeopathy.

‘If they are too injured, I take them to a pigeon sanctuary. I love them and they depend on me because I have raised them all their lives.’

Lee, of Pimlico, will be sentenced on February 4.
