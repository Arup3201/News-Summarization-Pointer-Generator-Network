A veterinary student whose face was paralysed in a car crash can today show her emotions again after having pioneering 'smile transplant' surgery.

Bethan Robertson-Smith, 29, woke from a 13-day coma to discover every muscle in her face had been paralysed and all her nerves were damaged.

She was left with her mouth permanently open, unable to blink or produce tears, with one eye stuck open and the other closed. 

But after years of being unable to raise a smile she tracked down a plastic reconstructive surgeon who carried out an incredible operation to attach a muscle from her temple to her mouth muscles.

The crash happened as she was driving to family home in Trefeglwys, mid-Wales, after her second term at university in February 2008. She skidded on water and lost control of the car

The ten-and-a-half hour 'smile transplant' means she can now smile, blink, cry and frown.

Although she had survived the car crash, Ms Robertson-Smith, from St Andrews in Bristol, said losing the ability to communicate using normal facial expressions was extremely difficult.

‘I was always told I was lucky to be alive, letting alone walking and talking,’ she said.

‘But I didn't feel lucky. It wasn't very nice to be a 22 or 23-year-old girl walking out into the world like that everyday.

‘It wasn't just not being able to smile - it was all the other emotions too. I couldn't even look angry. I couldn't cry.’

The crash happened as she was driving to family home in Trefeglwys, mid-Wales, after her second term at university in February 2008. She skidded on water and lost control of the car.

Another vehicle smashed into her passenger side, ramming the door into her head and crushing the bone canal containing the facial nerves.

The crash left her with five skull fractures, a bleed on the brain and traumatic injuries to the base of her skull.

The term facial palsy generally refers to weakness of the facial muscles, mainly resulting from temporary or permanent damage to the facial nerve.

When a facial nerve is either non-functioning or missing, the muscles in the face do not receive the necessary signals in order to function properly. 

This results in paralysis of the affected part of the face, which can affect movement of the eye(s) and/or the mouth, as well as other areas.

There are different degrees of facial paralysis: sometimes only the lower half of the face is affected, sometimes one whole side of the face is affected and in some cases both sides of the face are affected.

Her family feared she would never pull through, but after a 13-day induced coma she came round. 

After three months in hospital she was finally discharged, with doctors reassuring her that her face would eventually recover.

But while she learned to walk and talk the paralysis of her face, known as ‘bilateral facial palsy’ did not improve and she still could not show any emotion.

She said it was difficult  to have to re-learn how to carry out basic tasks, and her determination to get back to normal.

‘When I woke up I was like a small child. I had to learn to walk and talk and eat again.’ she said.

‘But my first words I spoke were "I can".' 

Doctors told her there was nothing they could do for her face, but her mother saw a programme on TV where pioneering surgeon Charles Nduka explained his first 'smile transplant'.

In February 2011, a doctor at Queen Victoria Hospital in West Sussex carried out the complex Labbe procedure - where the muscles which ran from Ms Robertson-Smith's temple to her jaw were detached at the bottom. 

They were then flipped over, her jaw was removed, and the muscles were attached to her smile muscles, allowing her to pull up the corners of her mouth. 

A week later she had surgery to insert small platinum chains in her eye lids to make them weighted to help them close. 

She had to work hard in physiotherapy sessions to strengthen the two muscles in her face - which now have to do the work of 14 muscles - but after eight weeks she could raise a small smile.

Just last month she had a further operation to adjust the tightness of the muscles.

Wanting to share her experience with others, Ms Robertson-Smith helped launch the charity Facial Palsy UK in 2012 and last month was given David Cameron's Point of Light award, which honours volunteers.

Although her brain injury means she can't work because she suffers from migraines, depression and exhaustion, she feels her operation was life-changing.

‘Now I like to test it.’ she said. ‘When I used to go out and about people would stare and I would look away. Now I catch someone's eye and try and smile at them, and now, unlike before, they smile back.’
