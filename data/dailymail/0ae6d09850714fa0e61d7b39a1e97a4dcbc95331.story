A schoolboy given just a five per cent chance of survival after he was hit by a car and flung against a bus, has made a miracle recovery.

Charlie Falcus, 12, was left with two skull fractures, a blood clot on the brain, fractured eye sockets, a broken collar bone and a laceration to his lung, following the road accident.

He was rushed to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where his parents Sarah and Mark, 45, were told to brace themselves for the worst.

But Charlie has battled back from the brink of death and amazed medics with his speedy recovery, spending just over a week in hospital following the accident.

He has now been discharged and is recovering at his home in Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle.

Mrs Falcus, said of her son: 'His life hung in the balance and if it wasn’t for the staff at the hospital we probably wouldn’t have had him here today.

'He’s our little miracle. At the hospital they put “Miracle Boy” on the front of his file. I just can’t believe he has pulled through. We really thought we were going to lose him.

'We’ve gone from critical to stable to having him home in a relatively short space of time.'

Charlie had just stepped off a local bus after making his way home from Newcastle city centre with three friends. He walked around the front of the bus and stepped out into the path of a family car.He was flung back into the bus before landing on a nearby curb.

Luckily, several police officers saw the incident and rushed to his aid.

Mrs Falcus, a personal assistant for Swinton Insurance, received a phone call from an officer to say her son had been involved in an accident.

Charlie was taken to the RVI where he spent three days in the intensive care unit before being transferred to another ward.

Mrs Falcus, 39, said: 'I just went from worrying about everyday things like what we were having for tea to thinking my whole world had fallen apart. It’s a mum’s worst nightmare getting that call.'

Charlie said: 'I got off the bus and put my hood up. I must have looked and not seen anything and got hit. That’s all I can remember until I woke up in hospital.

'I couldn’t believe it. I was really shocked. I looked down and I saw my feet and they were cut and bruised. When I saw a picture of myself it was kind of weird.'

Charlie, who loves playing football and rugby, spent his first day at home this week as he continues to recover. It is not known whether he may require surgery in the future.

The family thanked everyone who supported them during Charlie's time in hospital.

Sarah said: 'Everybody has been so lovely, from staff at the hospital to the local church, to Charlie’s school, friends and neighbours. Everybody has been asking after Charlie and I can’t thank them enough.'

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Officers were called at 4.43pm on November 10 to a crash at the junction with Etal Lane and Etal Way.

'The crash involved a Peugeot 207 and a pedestrian, a 12-year-old boy. No one was arrested in connection with the crash.'
