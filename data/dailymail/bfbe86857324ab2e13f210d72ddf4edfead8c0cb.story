One man has been arrested and another left with bite marks on his arm and chest after a dramatic fight in Brooklyn on Sunday which was  filmed by passing tourists.

Ahmed Hassan, 22, is believed to have taken $50 from an unsuspecting 23-year-old pedestrian before jumping into his car and attempting to get away.

However, the victim jumped into the car with Hassan, forcing the vehicle on to the wrong side of the road where it crashed before the two men bundled out and began brawling.
