A North Texas man has pleaded guilty to seeking revenge on his ex-girlfriend by emailing out videos of them having sex.

The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that 28-year-old Philip Welch Ingram struck the deal Thursday in exchange for five years of deferred adjudication probation.

He pleaded guilty to improper visual recording and breach of computer security.

Both are felonies.

Guilty: Philip Welch Ingram, 28, exacted revenge on an ex-girlfriend by sending her email contacts videos he had secretly taken of their sexual acts. He pleaded guilty in exchange for five years of deferred adjudication probation

Ingram must undergo psychological treatment and pay a $500 fine.

He can't live in Tarrant County or contact the ex-girlfriend as part of the agreement.

Police say Ingram hid a video recorder to film the couple.

According to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the paper, Ingram and the victim began dating in summer 2012.

Within months they were living together, but the relationship soon deteriorated.

The woman told investigators that Ingram later broke into her home using her hidden emergency key, and that she once awoke to find him sitting on her bed, going through her cellphone.

She called 911 but he left before police arrived, the affidavit states.

The victim previously told the Star-Telegram that on the night before the emails were sent out, Ingram had sent her several disturbing text messages, falsely accusing her of being out with another man.

He then threatened to email out videos of the couple engaged in sexual acts and sent her excerpts of the videos to prove he had them.

She said his last message, 'Have a good morning,' was sent about 2 am on May 30, 2013, as she slept.

When the woman woke, Ingram had already hacked into the woman’s email, sending the explicit videos to more than 100 of the woman's contacts — including her parents, friends, employer, and professional associates.

'My parents actually came to my house around 5:30 a.m. and woke me up because my dad had received the email,' the woman previously told the Star-Telegram.

Ingram declined comment to the newspaper after the hearing.
