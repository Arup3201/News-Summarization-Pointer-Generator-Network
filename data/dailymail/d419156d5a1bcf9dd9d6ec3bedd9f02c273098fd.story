On Sunday, deputies said Bolden broke into a woman's home who was bed-ridden, held her up at knife point, assaulted her, cut her on the arm, stole her pocket book and then ran off.

Menacing: Jonas Stanley Bolden, 23, of Bean Station, is accused of two especially aggravated armed robberies by Hamblen County Sheriff's Office

Deceiving: Authorities are hunting Sarah Long too as part of a couple they consider armed and dangerous in two robberies that left both victims injured

Callous disregard: Both Long and her boyfriend Bolden assaulted victims at knifepoint, as well as threatening and using violence against them as they robbed the two houses

Carrie McCann, with the Hamblen County Sheriff's Office, says the suspects chose their victims because they knew they were at home and vulnerable.

'It's kinda unusual, most criminals go to a location that's not occupied that they can get away from fairly quickly. These people don't seem to care, which makes them extremely dangerous,' said Ms. McCann to WVLT. 

Deputies said Bolden and Long are armed and dangerous.

Betrayal: The victims met Bolden and his girlfriend through his church and were trying to help him out. One of the victims lent him money only days before
