London Mayor Boris Johnson wants the Government to pay Diesel car owners between £1,000 and £2,000 in a national scrappage scheme

Boris Johnson has called for all diesel cars which are more than a year old to be scrapped because their fumes harm our health.

The London Mayor wants the Government to pay the owners between £1,000 and £2,000 in a national scrappage scheme.

He said millions were unfairly ‘seduced’ into buying diesel by being told it was greener.

‘I feel very sorry for them,’ Mr Johnson told the Commons Environmental Audit Comittee yesterday.

‘This has been a massive failure of public policy. Millions were told they were doing the right thing, the clean thing, the environmentally friendly thing, by buying a diesel.They feel very hacked off now they’re told they are more polluting.’

Mr Johnson said a national diesel scrappage scheme would encourage motorists to switch to cleaner vehicles.

Scientists believe diesel produces more of the tiny particles and nitrogen oxides that damage human health.

It is now known that diesel fumes create a variety of long-term problems for the heart and lungs, particularly in children.

Senior scientists have even blamed diesel for directly causing the deaths of 7,000 people in Britain every year.

Mr Johnson, who drives a petrol Toyota people carrier, has already announced moves to discourage diesel cars in the capital.

In July he revealed plans for almost all diesel vehicle drivers to be charged an extra £10 to drive into Central London as part of a new ultra-low emissions zone from 2020. Other cities across the country are also considering a charge as they urgently look at ways to cut diesel fumes to comply with EU clean air rules.

Around 29,000 deaths a year are linked to air pollution in Britain.

Professor Frank Kelly, a Government adviser, said about a quarter of these – roughly 7,000 deaths a year – could be attributed to diesel emissions. Britain is facing £300million in European Commission fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution.

Strict targets should have been met by January 2010 and in February this year the EU launched legal proceedings to force the Government to deal with air pollution.

The European Commission says Britain fails to meet air quality targets in 16 areas, including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow.

Asked why he was not bringing in the ultra-low emission zone earlier in London, Mr Johnson said: ‘The reason for not going any faster is simply we have got to be fair to the punter, to people buying vehicles now. They will feel very aggrieved that a car on which they have spent a huge sum of money is not going to be compliant.’

He also said there would be a rapid expansion of hybrid buses and electric buses.

Mr Johnson has also introduced rules banning taxis older than 15 years in London, to the fury of cab drivers. The rule means 3,000 taxis will have to be retired. He has also demanded that by 2018, all taxis in Central London should be either hybrid or full electric models.

Nearly half of cars registered in Britain are now diesel – a massive increase since 2000, when they comprised only 14 per cent.

However, last night a Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘There are no current plans for a car scrappage scheme.

‘This Government has invested £2billion in a range of measures to help improve air quality.’
