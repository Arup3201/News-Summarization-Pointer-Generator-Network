Carlo Ancelotti has warned Liverpool their problems run deeper than Mario Balotelli as he looks to guide Real Madrid to the Champions League knockout stage.

Liverpool arrive here in the Spanish capital on Monday with the unenviable task of trying to halt Real's juggernaut. The reigning Champions League holders have won their last 11 games and extending that sequence to a 12th match would take them through to the last 16.

By contrast, Brendan Rodgers’ side have floundered and suffered another confidence-draining defeat at the weekend, losing 1-0 to Newcastle. During their struggles, Balotelli has attracted much scrutiny and Ancelotti was asked for his view at Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex.

Ancelotti’s answer was significant. Balotelli might be the focus because he has failed to score a Barclays Premier League goal but Real Madrid’s head coach was quick to point out that is not the only conundrum Brendan Rodgers is trying to work out. He feels criticism of  24-year-old Balotelli is unfair.

‘Balotelli is spoken of a lot, maybe too much,’ said Ancelotti, who expects to unleash Gareth Bale against Liverpool now that the world’s most expensive player has recovered from a thigh injury. ‘He has quality and is at a side where they are not playing well.

‘They have lost Suarez who scored a lot and they need another solution. But I don’t think all of Livepool’s problems are about Balotelli. He needs to do his work for the side, that’s all that can be asked of him. The coach needs to find the right system with the new players.’

Of Bale, Ancelotti added: ‘Gareth Bale is ready to play and is back from injury and I don’t know if he will play from the off or on the bench.’

There is a chance history could be made in Tuesday’s game as Cristiano Ronaldo needs only two goals to usurp another Real legend, Raul, as the all-time Champions League top scorer and, given his staggering form, few would bet against him.

The way Ronaldo has been playing, it could be suggested he is worth a one-goal start to Madrid and Ancelotti admitted he is finding it difficult to talk about the Portugal international, as he has bestowed so many compliments upon him.

‘I have to speak about Cristiano a lot,’ said Ancelotti. ‘The last time I said it’s hard to find a new word to describe him. What can I say? He’s a fantastic player and professional and that’s it. He is working hard for himself and the side, just like other players such as (Karim) Benzema and James (Rodriguez).

‘He is a team player. He will pass to players in better positions if they have a better chance to score than him. We have been on a good run and that helps us. I don’t think he’s thinking about the record. He has time, it’s not his last game, he is focused on playing for the team.

There was, however, an ominous message for Liverpool.

‘We have a serious side,’ said Ancelotti. ‘I don’t think that we will lose.’

Ancelotti, meanwhile, has brushed off talk about his own future. He has a year and a half left on his contract but, even though he has won three trophies since he arrived from Paris St Germain, insists there is no hurry to enter discussions.

‘There’s time to talk about this (new contract). I have 18 months left and there’s no rush,’ said Ancelotti. ‘We will be fine.’
