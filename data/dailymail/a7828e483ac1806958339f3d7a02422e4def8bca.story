A father and daughter in Houston decided to take the law into their own hands on Friday.

The plastic surgeon, who was picked up from the airport by his daughter following a business trip, returned home to find a group of apparent thieves pulling out of their driveway in south Houston.

So the two decided to go after them, KHOU reported.

Courageously chasing down the red pick-up truck, which was carrying three suspects, the father started filming the action scene on his cellphone while his daughter was behind the wheel.

The young woman managed to ram the bandits with her dark Audi.

However, realizing they were being chased, the thugs start to retaliate.

As the chase continued, the men suddenly stopped and speedily went into reverse, knocking into the daring duo.

'Dad, now what do I do?' the woman can be heard asking on the video.

He tells her to keep going.

They chased the truck for several more miles until the suspects turned their vehicle around and aimed it right at the father and daughter.

In the most intense part of the video, the truck comes barreling toward them, the passenger of the truck hanging from the door.

The cars collide, but the impact sent the truck hurtling into a ditch.

The doctor, a Houston plastic surgeon who asked not to be named, said he does regret going after the alleged bandits

Significant damage was done to the daughter's car as a result of the chase

The police were able to arrive at the scene and arrest two of the suspects, while one got away on foot

Police arrived at the scene moments later and arrested two of the suspects.

One got away on foot.

Authorities have advised people not to go after potentially dangerous people in such a fashion.

However the father, who agreed to talk to the media but did not want to be identified, said that he would it again.

'It was just like in the movies,' the father told KHOU of the chase.

'I’m tired of these people taking advantage of us,' he said, adding that there have been other robberies in the neighborhood.

'We’re not going to tolerate it anymore in our neighborhood.'

The father praised his quick-thinking daughter and how she acted.

'I'm proud of my daughter ... She is a very hard-nosed girl.'

The woman was treated for whiplash in hospital but later released.

The victims were able to recover several of their stolen belongings from the back of the truck.
