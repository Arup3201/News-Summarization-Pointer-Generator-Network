Arturo Vidal has been fined £78,400 by Juventus and is set to face further disciplinary action for having a night out ahead of their clash against Roma on Sunday.

The Chile international who saw a move to Manchester United scuppered by his troublesome knee injury was dropped to the bench for Juve's 3-2 win over Roma.

Vidal only recently returned from another injury and Juventus are annoyed that ahead of such an important clash against rivals Roma, that the midfielder was out until the early hours of Friday morning.

Photographs of the 27-year-old in a Turin bar emerged in the Italian media and Juve have fined the midfielder €100,000.

Juventus CEO Giuseppe Marotta said: 'Vidal is the typical South American player. The history of football is full of these types of stories. [Former Juventus player and Argentina international Omar] Sivori was one of them, so was [ex-Inter Milan and Argentina star Antonio] Angelillo and many others.

'South Americans are like that. They live certain situations in their own way, they have a way to celebrate and to enjoy themselves.

'We just have to keep him at bay and control him. From a football standpoint, we cannot say anything. A fine of €100,000? Perhaps it's not enough.'
