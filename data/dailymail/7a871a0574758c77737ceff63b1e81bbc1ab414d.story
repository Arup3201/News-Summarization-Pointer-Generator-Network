The 2-year-old girl who was the youngest person to ever receive a bio-engineered organ has died two months after doctors implanted her with a new windpipe.

Hannah Warren was born without a windpipe and underwent an experimental procedure to be implanted with one made from stem cells.

The procedure took place on April 9, and the spokesman for the Children's Hospital of Illinois announced that she died on Saturday.

The hospital says in a statement that Hannah couldn't 'overcome additional health issues that were identified as her care progressed.'

The stem cells came from Hannah's bone marrow, extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone.  

They were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold, where it took a few days for them to multiply and create a new windpipe.

Hannah was born in South Korea and traveled to Illinois for the surgery.

Her family has asked for privacy.

Hannah was unable to breathe, eat, drink or swallow on her own since she was born in South Korea in 2010.

Until the April 9 operation at the Children's Hospital of Illinois, the toddler had spent her entire life in a hospital in Seoul. Doctors there told her parents there was no hope and they expected her to die.

The stem cells came from Hannah's bone marrow, extracted with a special needle inserted into her hip bone. They were seeded in a lab onto a plastic scaffold, where it took less than a week for them to multiply and create a new windpipe.

About the size of a 3-inch tube of penne pasta, it was implanted in a nine-hour procedure.

Early signs indicate the windpipe showed it as working, but she remained on a ventilator for weeks following the procedure.

Only about one in 50,000 children worldwide are born with the windpipe defect. The stem-cell technique has been used to make other body parts besides windpipes and holds promise for treating other birth defects and childhood diseases, her doctors said.

The operation brought together an 
Italian surgeon based in Sweden who pioneered the technique, a pediatric
surgeon at Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria who met Hannah's 
family while on a business trip to South Korea, and Hannah — born to a 
Newfoundland man and Korean woman who married after he moved to that 
country to teach English.

Hannah's
parents had read about Dr. Paolo Macchiarini's success using stem-cell 
based tracheas but couldn't afford to pay for the operation at his 
center, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

So Dr. Mark Holterman 
helped the family arrange to have the procedure at his Peoria hospital, 
bringing in Macchiarini to lead the operation. Children's Hospital 
waived the cost, likely hundreds of thousands of dollars, Holterman 
said.

Part of OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, the Roman Catholic hospital considers the operation part of their mission to provide charity care, but also views it as a way to champion a type of stem-cell therapy that doesn't involve human embryos, the surgeons said.

The Catholic church opposes using stem cells derived from human embryos in research or treatment.

Macchiarini has been involved in 14 
previous windpipe operations using patients' own stem cells — five using
man-made scaffolds like Hannah's but in adults; and nine using 
scaffolds made from cadaver windpipes, including one in a 10-year-old 
British boy.

He
said only one patient died, a 30-year-old man from Abingdon, Maryland, who 
had the operation in November 2011 to treat late-stage cancer of the 
windpipe. He died about four months later of uncertain causes, 
Macchiarini said.

Similar methods have been used to grow bladders, urethras and last year a girl in Sweden got a lab-made vein using her own stem cells and a cadaver vein.

Scientists hope to eventually use the method to create solid organs, including kidneys and livers, said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of Wake Forest University's Institute for Regenerative Medicine. He said the operation on Hannah Warren 'is really showing that the technique is workable.'

Hannah had breathing difficulties at birth and Korean doctors soon discovered the missing windpipe.

They reconfigured her esophagus so that a breathing tube could go down it from her mouth to her lungs. The esophagus normally runs behind the windpipe and carries food to the stomach.
