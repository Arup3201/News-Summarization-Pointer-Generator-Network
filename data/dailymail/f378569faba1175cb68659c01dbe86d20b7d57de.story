Earlier this week MailOnline reported the shocking story of 25-year-old Gemma Wood's battle to get a diagnosis of bowel cancer.

Despite telling her GP she thought she had the disease, it was nine months before she was eventually sent for the tests which confirmed her worst fears.

The story brought back bitter memories for Rebecca Holden, 36, a PA from west London who lives with her husband Piers, 39, and their sons, Max and Nico.

She too had feared she had the disease, but was repeatedly dismissed by doctors as being neurotic.

It is only through sheer persistence that she is alive today.

Desperate to raise awareness that bowel cancer doesn't just affect the elderly, she has shared her story with MailOnline...

Rebecca Holden (with sons Max and Nico) struggled to get her bowel cancer symptoms taken seriously and says it is only through sheer persistence she is alive today

Earlier this week MailOnline reported the shocking story of the battle 25-year-old Gemma Wood had to receive a diagnosis of bowel cancer - something Rebecca Holden knows only too well

I was absolutely furious when I read the story about Gemma Wood and her struggle to get a bowel cancer diagnosis.

It is an outrage that so many doctors are still refusing to accept this disease affects young people.

Anyone presenting with these symptoms should be checked out for the disease because it does affect young people.

Yes, bowel cancer is almost a taboo - after all, who wants to talk about their bottom and bodily functions in great detail with total strangers?

But, having read yet another article about a young person suffering from this illness, I want to share my story so that more people are aware of the symptoms and understand that it is not just the elderly who should be concerned.

Mrs Holden - pictured with Max just before starting her chemotherapy - was only diagnosed after seeing a private doctor

Mrs Holden (pictured in hospital after surgery to remove her tumour in May 2011) started to suffer stomach pain and bleeding when she went to the toilet when she was pregnant with her first son, Max

I was diagnosed with bowel cancer three years ago at the age of 33 and I’m living proof that if you listen to your body and follow your instincts, you can beat this deadly disease.

Back in April 2011 I had just given birth to my first son, Max, and was enjoying my first year of marriage to my husband, Piers. 

In the past I had always suffered from 
stomach cramps and had the odd pile but I just put this down to IBS or 
to the fact that I was a keen runner – running can aggravate piles.

I
 also had blood in my stools - seriously unsexy - but we are all a little 
bit British when it comes to talking about our rear-ends, and 
embarrassment aside, this is a common symptom of bowel cancer which 
should never be ignored.

It was only four weeks after the birth of my son via emergency caesarean section when I realised something was seriously wrong.

I
 had severe abdominal pain which sent me to Charing Cross A&E twice,
 yet both times I was sent home without any thorough investigation.

After Max's birth, Mrs Holden (pictured with her husband, Piers) repeatedly went to A&E with agonising stomach pains but each time she was fobbed off and sent home without a diagnosis

On my third visit, I refused to leave until I was given an ultrasound - this was carried out grudgingly, but revealed no abnormalities. 

Yet again I was sent away and told if the pain persisted to see my GP - there was nothing the hospital could do. 

Despite being told I was suffering from constipation by both a GP and a consultant at Charing Cross hospital in London, I was certain that I was experiencing something more serious.

Because of my age I never for one second thought it could be bowel cancer, but I knew it wasn’t constipation.

If it weren’t for another GP, Dr Louise Cavanagh at the Hammersmith Surgery in London, I would not be alive today.

Repeated trips to A&E and my local surgery to be told there was nothing wrong did not deter me.

It was only through sheer persistence and listening to my own body that I managed to get the correct diagnosis so quickly.

Mrs Holden (pictured with Max during her treatment) refused to believe there was nothing wrong with her and persisted until a GP suggested that she make use of her private health insurance and see a private doctor

I will never forget the time I overheard one consultant insinuating to his colleague that given the number of times I’d been to A&E, I must be suffering from postnatal depression, and I was only in hospital to get away from my baby. I was utterly shocked.

Dr Cavanagh was the only doctor to take me seriously.

As I was fortunate enough to have private healthcare as a benefit from my employer, she urged me to see a colorectal surgeon for a thorough investigation.

I went home and Googled ‘colorectal surgeons’ - the first name to appear was Professor Sina Dorudi at the Princess Grace Hospital in London - I contacted him immediately.

At Princess Grace I was given another 
ultrasound which revealed a mass in my colon, Charing Cross Hospital had
 performed the very same test and had managed to miss it.

Professor Dorudi then performed a colonoscopy and I was given the life changing news that it was highly likely the tumour found in my colon was cancerous.

Mrs Holden is now cancer-free but is still being carefully monitored. Her surgeon told her that had she had the operation a few weeks later the cancer would already have spread around her body. Image shows her sons

It is amazing how quickly things can happen if someone is paying for it.

It was hard to believe that just two months ago I had given birth, and now I was dealing with a lethal tumour.

I underwent an extended right hemi-colectomy in May 2011 which removed 50 per cent of my colon and my appendix. 

I was lucky that the tumour was high up enough to avoid needing a colostomy bag - at the time I didn’t care what I ended up with so long as I got rid of the tumour. 

Professor Dorudi told me that the tumour was literally about to perforate my colon wall and it could have been a matter of weeks before the cancer spread to my entire body and the outcome would have been fatal.

Mrs Holden (pictured on holiday with her husband before she was diagnosed) had to have surgery to remove part of her colon and her appendix. She also had to have intensive and gruelling chemotherapy

He suspected the tumour had been growing for around three years and it was possibly the pregnancy that aggravated the tumour to the point it caused me so much pain.

It was only with my second pregnancy I realised the constant pain throughout my first was abnormal.

The pregnancy was not planned but I truly believe it happened for a reason and Max and I will always have a special bond – he saved my life.

Due to the tumour being so aggressive (pathology results revealed it was T4, the most severe of the four stages), I was prescribed 12 cycles of Folfox chemotherapy under the care of Dr David Propper.

Whilst the chemotherapy was brutal and put me in hospital five cycles out of nine (due to adverse reactions I didn’t manage the full 12 cycles), I knew the doctors were doing all they could to ensure this destructive disease never returned. 

Fast forward three years and I’m cancer-free.

Mrs Holden (pictured with her husband on her wedding day) says it makes her angry when she hears about other young people struggling to get a diagnosis of bowel cancer

Bowel cancer is cancer which starts in the large bowel.

It is sometimes also called colon cancer or rectal cancer.

Symptoms include blood in the stools, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss.

As the disease progresses, it can also cause fatigue and breathlessness.

Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England and there are about 40,000 cases diagnosed every year.

Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases occur in people who are over 65.

People
 who are older, who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat, those who 
are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk.

People who smoke and drink a lot of alcohol, as well as those with a family history of the disease, are also at increased risk.

Eight months ago I gave birth to my second son, Nico, despite being told the chemotherapy could make me infertile.

Piers and I feel very fortunate that we were able to have another child.

I am still undergoing regular CT/MRI scans and blood tests and my last check-up came back normal.

It makes me incredibly angry to read about so many other young people who have been misdiagnosed because the NHS refuses to acknowledge that young people also suffer from this form of cancer.

I also question why I was not offered an MRI or CT scan when admitted to A&E, and more importantly, why the radiographer at Charing Cross failed to see the mass in my colon.

If I had not had the advantage of private healthcare who knows how long it would have taken for the cancer to be discovered, by which point it would have been too late.

It’s bowel cancer awareness month and if just one person reads this and it gives them the courage to go to their doctor and insist on getting the correct scans, then my own battle has not been in vain.

I am not unique - bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the UK and it is clearly not just the over 65s who are affected.

A spokeswoman for Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust said: 'We were deeply sorry to hear of Mrs Holden’s diagnosis and that she was unhappy with the care we provided to her.

'At the time, we thoroughly investigated the care we provided.

'Our clinicians had undertaken ultrasound scans, X-rays, blood tests and an examination as well as taking Mrs Holden’s history. These were all reviewed as part of the investigation.

'Unfortunately there was nothing on clinical examination or any of the investigations which would have pointed to a diagnosis of colon cancer.

'Our patient experience is very important to us and we are sorry that Mrs Holden felt her symptoms were not being taken seriously.

'We remain keen to meet with Mrs Holden, if she wishes, to further discuss her concerns.'
