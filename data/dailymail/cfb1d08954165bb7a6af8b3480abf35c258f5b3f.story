An electrician who died while repairing a faulty microwave at a Marks & Spencer store had not unplugged the device, an inquest heard this week.

Grandfather-of-seven Philip Dodd was called to the store in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on November 3 last year to fix the microwave in the staff canteen.

But when the 62-year-old, of Horley, Surrey, went to fix the microwave he did not unplug it from the mains, the inquest heard on Thursday.

The Marks & Spencer store in Royal Tunbridge Wells where Philip Dodd suffered the electric shock

The court heard how Mr Dodd suffered as fatal electric shock as he tried to fix the microwave when he accidentally touched an uninsulated controller to a magnetron in the microwave.

Staff at the store said they came to Mr Dodd’s aid after hearing a ‘terrific crash’ in kitchen - finding him dead on the floor and the microwave plugged in.

Tunbridge Wells Borough Council environmental health officer John Broughton told jurors: 'It appears he was electrocuted when he inadvertently touched a live conductor to the magnetron he was trying to repair.

'The machine should have been disconnected from the power supply before he attempted that.'

The inquest heard how Mr Dodd was working for engineer providers Millers Vanguard, part of the AFE group, and had been an electrician for 28 years.

AFE chief executive Tim Smith said: “The company’s procedure states that microwaves should not be worked on live and our training mantra of the three D’s - disconnect from main supply, discharge and open the doors - had unfortunately not been complied with.”

A jury returned a verdict of accidental death and coroner Roger Hatch expressed his sympathies to Mr Dodd’s family.

The Kent & Sussex Courier reported that shocked staff who were 'directly affected' by the incident were given as much time off as they needed by Marks & Spencer.

Mr Dodd's children paid tribute to keen photographer Mr Dodd, who lost his wife Christine to cancer in 2003.

His daughter Tina Garner told the Gatwick and Horley Times: 'He was a person that would help anyone that needed help.'

She added: 'He was the best dad you could have.'He wouldn't want to worry anyone; he always wanted the best for everyone else.'
