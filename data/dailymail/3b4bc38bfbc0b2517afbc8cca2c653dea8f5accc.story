A guitar used by pop star Alvin Stardust to collect the autographs of some of music’s biggest names is now worth more than £1 million.

Stardust, 71, was 12 when he was given the instrument in 1955 by his father, who had bought it for £1 and two shillings.

The youngster took it to a Buddy Holly and the Crickets concert in Doncaster where the band signed it – and the starstruck teen dubbed the guitar ‘Peggy Sue’ after Holly’s song.

Those first autographs started a tradition and the guitar has since been signed by, among others, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Sir Cliff Richard and has been valued at £1.25 million.

Stardust, who enjoyed a No 1 hit in 1974 with Jealous Mind, has no plans to sell but when a friend said he could get a decent price for it, he had it valued.

He said: ‘When my dad gave me that guitar, little did we know, after all these years, what a story it would be able to tell.’

The singer collected many of the signatures when he was a teenager performing as Shane Fenton and the Fentones in the early 1960s.

He said: ‘I hung around stage doors schmoozing until they let me in. Since I always took Peggy Sue, they often assumed I was part of the act and just ushered me through.’

Explaining how he got the autographs of The Beatles at the Albert Hall in 1963, he said: ‘I knew a security chap called Len. He whisked my guitar away and a few minutes later came back with all the boys’ autographs on it.

‘They didn’t know it was mine, but later that night John and Paul, who I knew a bit, came up to me and said, “You’re from London – where can we meet some birds?” ’

Rick Zsigmond, owner of Vintage Guitar Emporium in West London, which valued the instrument, said: ‘The fact it tells the story of rock from its very infancy and in such a wonderful way is what makes it so valuable.’
