Bill Cosby, pictured on stage last week, has refused to discuss sexual assault allegations against him 

The author of a new Bill Cosby biography is apologizing for not pursuing allegations that the comedian had drugged and sexually assaulted numerous women.

Mark Whitaker, whose Cosby: His Life and Times was published in September, tweeted on Monday that he was wrong not to 'aggressively' look into the charges and promised to address them 'at the appropriate time'.

'If true the stories are shocking and horrible,' wrote Whitaker, whose account was confirmed by his New York-based publisher, Simon & Schuster.

Whitaker's apology came in response to New York Times reporter David Carr's criticism tha the ignored the allegations across several decades which were levied at the performer.  

Reports about Cosby have been public knowledge for years, but resurfaced last month after a video of comedian Hannibal Buress calling Cosby a rapist went viral. 

With several additional women accusing Cosby of assaulting them, projects on NBC and Netflix have been canceled, and TV Land decided not to air reruns of The Cosby Show.

Cosby, 77, has issued a statement denying the accusations and called them 'innuendo'. 

His lawyer Martin Singer has branded the stories 'completely illogical' and added that the claims are 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'passed the point of absurdity'.

In a statement released on Friday, he said: 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity.

'These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.' 

Whitaker's book has been widely criticized for idealizing Cosby, until recently one of the country's most beloved entertainers, although some critics praised it upon release. 

Amazon.com included 'Cosby' among its best books of September and top 100 biographies and memoirs of 2014. 

The book includes blurbs from David Letterman, Jerry Seinfeld and Mary Tyler Moore.

Cosby's biographer tweeted this response to a New York Times reporter's criticism of his Cosby biography

'If I was America's ''sweetheart'' - turning the world on with a smile - then Bill Cosby was and still is our ''best man,''' Moore wrote.

'A revealing, honest look at my favorite comedian,' reads a blurb from Billy Crystal. 

According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks around 80 per cent of print sales, Cosby has sold around 6,000 copies.

It's a small number for a well-publicized book, but not unusual in an increasingly tight market for hardcover nonfiction, which has been hurt by the decline of physical stores. 

As of midday on Tuesday, Cosby ranked No. 13,711 on Amazon.

Cosby cooperated with Whitaker, agreeing to be interviewed. But, according to Simon & Schuster, Cosby had no control over the book's contents.

Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past.

Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby.

Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him.

Janice Dickinson - The supermodel  (pictured right) said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her.

Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows.

Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it.

Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client.

Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee.

Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room.

Victoria Valentino - The former Playboy playmate claims Cosby drugged her and a friend, tried to rape her friend then violated her instead in a Hollywood apartment after dinner.

Jewel Allison - The former model accused Cosby of drugging her wine and making her feel his genitals before kissing her during a dinner at his home in the late Eighties.

Michelle Hurd: The 47-year-old actress, best known for her roles on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, revealed she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting inappropriately around her. In a Facebook post this weekend, she described being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things became too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, "No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened'''.

Joyce Emmons: The former comedy club manager claims she woke up naked next to a friend of Bill Cosby after the comedian gave her a sedative when she complained of a migraine. Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s. She claims Cosby drugged her but has not accused him of sexual assault.

According to The New York Post, after dinner and drinks at his home, he massaged her then 'guided her hand towards his sweatpants'. Cosby denied the claim and no charges were filed.
