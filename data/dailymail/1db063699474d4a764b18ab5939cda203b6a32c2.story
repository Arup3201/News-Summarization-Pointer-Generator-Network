Boris Johnson’s hopes of building a brand new London airport have suffered a major blow after the world’s biggest airlines refused to leave Heathrow.

The London Mayor has called for the West London airport to be bulldozed and replaced with a brand new hub on the Thames.

But all of the major global alliances of airlines have baulked at the idea of abandoning Heathrow as part of plans to increase airport capacity.

Blow: London Mayor Boris Johnson has called for Heathrow to be bulldozed and flights moved to a new hub airport, but airlines are refusing to budge

Staying put: British Airways is among the world's leading airlines refusing to leave Heathrow

The Davies Commission is due to 
deliver its first report to the Government by the end of this year and 
its final report by the summer of 2015.

After furious protests from local people, at the last election the Conservatives vowed to oppose Heathrow expansion.

But David Cameron ordered the Davis Commission to explore the best option for expanding capacity.

Last month Heathrow bosses unveiled their radical plans for a four runway ‘super-hub’ handling up to a million flights a year.

They
revealed three options for a controversial new third runway to double 
annual passenger numbers — and win the race to be Europe’s main 
international hub airport.

The Davis Commission could recommend the UK having a second hub alongside Heathrow, with at least one of the airlines alliances moved elsewhere.

But British Airways has insisted it 
wants to stay at Heathrow, and has the backing of the Oneworld alliance 
which it leads and whose members also include American Airlines, 
airberlin and Iberia.

Members
of the Star alliance, which includes Germany's Lufthansa, America’s 
United Airlines and Singapore Airlines, is moving to Heathrow’s new 
Terminal 2 next year and does not want to go elsewhere either.

A
spokesman said: ‘This will allow us to effectively compete with the 
other alliances in Heathrow and add to the quality of our services, and 
therefore we do not see any opportunity for us to make a change to 
another airport.’

The SkyTeam alliance which includes Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines of the US and China Eastern has also ruled out leaving Heathrow, the FT reported.

Tae Joon Kim, SkyTeam's vicepresident of airport services said in a letter to the Davies commission, ‘Relocating to another London or UK airport is not an option for our members.’

London Mayor Mr Johnson has claimed the idea of Heathrow being the major hub London needed was 'crackers'.

And environmentalists criticised proposals for Heathrow expansion, though bosses say bigger and cleaner planes and quieter and reducing car and vehicle pollution around the airport will make it better than at present.

Colin Matthews, Heathrow’s chief executive, said: ‘After half a century of vigorous debate but little action, it is clear the UK desperately needs a single hub airport with the capacity to provide the links to emerging economies which can boost UK jobs, GDP and trade.

‘It is clear that the best solution for taxpayers, passengers and business is to build on the strength we already have at Heathrow.

‘Today we are showing how that vision can be achieved whilst keeping the impact on local resident to an absolute minimum.’

Each of the options will mean compulsory purchase of some properties, and some property demolitions, while there might have to be major work done on the M25 to accommodate a new runway.

There will also need to be a sixth terminal at Heathrow, with a new runway meaning the airport will be able to handle 130 million passengers a year rather than the current figure of 70 million.

Heathrow executives said they did not think there would be a need for a fourth runway at Heathrow until at least 2040.
