A former Countdown champion was today crowned the board game Scrabble's UK champion - clinching the title with the 71 point-scoring word 'neonates'.

Belfast solicitor Paul Gallen, 26, a previous winner of the popular TV word game Countdown, held his head in his hands in relief as he won the coveted title in a nail-biting three game final in London yesterday.

After winning the trophy and £2,500 cash prize, Mr Gallen admitted he was, for once, nearly lost for words. But only after he secured his winning word - 'neonates' - that means newborn child.

Sultan of spelling: Paul Gallen 26, from Belfast is crowned the 41st national Scrabble champion at the Cavendish Conference Centre in West London

Battle: Paul beat Wale Fashina, 43, from Liverpool with a score of 3-1 in a tense finale

A former victor says competitive players are using computer programmes to calculate what words are likely to appear

He said: 'It feels surreal. I am delighted. It is something that I have always wanted to win ever since I started paying Scrabble.'

The 26 year-old, who only took up the popular boardgame seven years ago, said he was proud to be the first ever Northern Irishman to win the national title in its 41st year.

However, the avid Newcastle United football fan admitted he didn't know the meaning of many of the mind-boggling words he played to win the championship.

He said: 'Hirudin was one of the best words I played, but I don't know what it means.

'It is really a game of maths - you are just taking on extra work by trying to learn all the definitions.

'I do try and learn a few of the definitions to give the words some life, but hirudin is quite a low probability word.

'I hope that my win encourages people in Northern Ireland to come out of the woodwork and play Scrabble.'

No hard feelings: The contest was tight but Paul emerged the victor, helped along by a 71-point word in the final game

Mr Gallen is no stranger to winning 
tournaments. He was the proud winner of the television show Countdown 
Champion of Champions in 2006 before turning his attention to Scrabble.

He said: 'The secret to my success? It probably comes from watching Countdown and writing down all the words from dictionary corner and then learning all the words with Z's and Q's which are useful.'

Phenomenon: The game is sold in 121 countries and there are 29 different language versions. Approximately 150million sets have been sold worldwide

Collecting his trophy in front of an audience of around 60 Scrabble enthusiasts in central London this afternoon, the new champion said he would spend his £2,500 winnings on whisking his girlfriend Nicole Thompson off for a romantic holiday

He said: 'She has been cheering me on back home in Belfast so I will probably take her on holiday. But it isn't reallly about the prize money, it is all about the title.'

More than 400 Scrabble lovers, aged from 10 to 90, entered the competition to be named the country's greatest wordsmith.

And Mr Gallen was put to the test in eight rounds before beating his opponent, Liverpudlian accountant Olawale Fashina in a nail-biting final game, beating him 419 points to 356.

Championship organiser and former four times UK scrabble champion Philip Nelkon said Scrabble is enjoying a resurgence in popularity as youngsters now play the classic boardgame on their smartphones

However, he said true aficionados spend hours poring over computer programmes to brush up on the probability of high scoring words.

Mr Nelkon added: 'The standard goes up every year and that is chiefly because of the development of computer programmes to help people learn words and study moves.

'Thirty years ago you had to learn words straight out of the dictionary, but now you can use computer programmes to brush up on the probability of certain words. People are learning words specifically to play competitive Scrabble.'
