Two best friends have sent each other the same Christmas card  for the past 36 years.

Jackie Watson, of East Sussex, and June Monaghan, of West Sussex, have kept the tradition going since 1978, when Mrs Watson decided to play a trick on her friend.Â 

Instead of writing a new Christmas card, she popped the one she had received from Mrs Monaghan the year before back in the post with the  joke: 'Couldn't afford new cards this year.'

When Mrs Watson sent the same card back again the following year, the festive tradition began.

The friends, now both 79, met as 25-year-olds working as BT telephone operators.

The card, which depicts a snow scene of a dog with a robin perched next to its head, is now  worn and creased, but is full with good wishes from each year.

It is now so full of messages that Post-it notes cover the inside so the friends can include their latest news and continue the tradition.

Mrs Watson, of Peacehaven, East Sussex, said: 'It was just a silly joke on a simple card. We like a laugh, we know each other so well.

'It is now part of Christmas in our families. All our relatives want to know who's got the card that year and what's been written inside.

'We always post it, even though we don't live too far from each other, and luckily it's never been lost in transit.

'We wonder if we are the only people in the country or the world to do it and also if the length of time is a record.'

The card, which features a dog holding a gun with a robin on the barrel, is now full of Post-it notes with the friends' messages from each year written on them

The messages are all dated and the pair say they hope the card never gets lost in the post

Each note is dated so the friends can track their progress. For example, their joy at the card lasting so long was clear in 1992 when Jackie said: 'Who would have believed '92?!'

A note in 1994 was just signed: 'You'll never guess who.'

The women worked together in Brighton, East Sussex, in the 1960s and, as neighbours, they would travel to work together.

Their children went to the same school and they shared holidays together. Now they meet up regularly for lunch.

Mrs Monaghan, of Lancing near Worthing, West Sussex, said: 'We've always been good friends and share the same sense of humour.

'We've travelled round the world together and the card is something we laugh about every year.'
