Jackie McNamara will be at Hampden on Saturday aiming to pen a footballing fairytale with a Dundee United team chasing a first Scottish League Cup victory since 1980.

But it’s not that long ago the 41-year-old was dreaming of the silver screen and not silverware after co-writing a pilot episode of a ribald sitcom called The Therapy Room.

McNamara’s younger brother, Donny - a tiler to trade - played the lead role of Peter Tully, a working-class Scottish Junior player catapulted into a world of WAGs and money after joining a fictional English Premier League club.

Gary Lewis, who starred in Billy Elliot and Gangs of New York, played the manager while Still Game actor Frank Gilhooley - who co-wrote the project - portrayed the chairman.

Nine episodes were drafted in total by McNamara in 2011 in the twilight of his playing days before he went on to manage Partick Thistle and then United.

Drawing heavily on his playing career with Dunfermline, Celtic and this weekend’s opponents Aberdeen, the pilot was never picked up by a television studio. However, screen-writing remains a hobby of McNamara’s to this day - and even if The Therapy Room had been a roaring success he still doesn’t believe it would have taken him off the path that led towards Saturday’s last-four clash.

‘If The Therapy Room had been picked up would I be sitting here today? Absolutely, yes,’ said the 41-year-old boss with a smile.

‘I did all that before I started on my coaching badges. I was doing it as a book. A lot of former players do biographies or autobiographies and it was kind of my way of doing certain things in a certain way. I don’t believe you can do a biography without hurting people! Not if you want to be honest, anyway.

‘It was just a side track, for me. It was escapism. But it’s something I might go back to. I have gathered a lot more material since then. I’ve certainly dealt with a lot more characters!

‘I still write little notes here and there to this day, as I did as a player. But I don’t sit down and write scripts just now, no.’

With his ability to pen dialogue, is McNamara ever tempted to write and perform a Churchillian speech before a big match like this one at Hampden?

‘I don’t script my team-talks, no,’ he said. ‘Everything I do or say to the players before a game or at half-time has not been written down. The stuff I don’t remember from matches I don’t see as important.

‘Instead, I do little team-talks, speaking to each player individually or to small groups of players. When I was a player, a manager would go through the whole team on the tactics board.

‘But if he was talking to defence alone, the midfield and forwards didn’t have his attention. They’d be looking at their boots.

‘So I try to get it so I’ve got their attention and I know they’re listening. Whether it’s the two full-backs and who they’re up against, or how the striker or strikers should be moving up front. It’s just the way I like to do it. Whether that’s right or wrong, who knows?’

For McNamara, the manager’s office at Tannadice has emerged as his very own Therapy Room, or certainly one in need of a psychiatrist’s couch. Because his team could be said to suffer from a split personality. A thrilling attacking unit they may be, but after beating Celtic they’re just as likely to lose to St Johnstone; or dish out an historic 6-2 thumping to fierce rivals Dundee and then draw at Partick Thistle or with lowly St Mirren.

In his role as manager and amateur psychologist, McNamara - who won four leagues, and each domestic cup three times at Celtic - is trying to weed out the fear he believes hampers his side’s performances. It’s one that presents a clear and present danger to Tangerine dreams of winning the League Cup for the first time in 35 years.

He said: ‘For me, the biggest thing is the mental side of it, the expectation and the fear. There’s a difference between expectation and actually being able to handle it.

‘When we drew with St Mirren recently, I felt fear and negativity in our play. We were in good positions and the ball ended up back at our goalkeeper. That comes from fear.

‘When I came in two years ago, we could not win at home. We’d only won two games in the first bit of the season until we won at home to Rangers in my first match.

‘Now we’re winning most of our matches at home but struggling at times away from home. It’s about trying to create an environment where there is no change playing home or away. And that, I believe, is about mentality.

‘It’s about getting the balance between fear and expectation right. We need to handle it and be positive. For instance, our younger players have not experienced that (fear). They don’t think about expectation. They just go out and play like normal. That’s refreshing. It’s what I want to see.’

Despite their mental frailties, McNamara points out that his team still have a tendency to rise to the big occasion. As such, he rates Saturday’s match with an Aberdeen side unbeaten in their last nine games as being too close to call.

‘We’ve handled the big games well,’ said McNamara, who is set to hand former Hearts defender Ryan McGowan a debut to remember against the Dons.

‘But we’ve been in winning positions against Partick Thistle and St Johnstone and dropped crucial points which have cost us in terms of our league position.

‘We dropped five points in those games and another two at St Mirren but we have nine wins out of 11 at home. Aberdeen are the only team to beat us at Tannadice this season.

‘Aberdeen have had a terrific season so far and they’ve done consistently well, especially when it comes to not conceding.

‘But we’re just three points behind them and I believe we’ve done well to hang in there with them. On Saturday, it will all be down to whoever does better on the day.’

McNamara’s screenwriting days may be temporarily behind him - but he hasn’t given up on scripting some happy endings with United.
