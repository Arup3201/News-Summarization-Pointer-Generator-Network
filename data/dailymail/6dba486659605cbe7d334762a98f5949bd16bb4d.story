Jorn Vancamp's second half strike gave Anderlecht a 2-1 win at Arsenal in the UEFA Youth League - leaving the Gunners hopes of progressing to the last 16 in the balance.

The 17-year-old headed home in the 74th minute after Arsenal goalkeeper Ryan Huddart was unable to deal with Alexis Scholl's initial effort.

Vancamp's strike was deserving for the visitors efforts in a spirited display at Borehamwood's Meadow Park.

They took an early lead in the fifth minute of the match through Samuel Bastien following a neat move by the Belgian outfit.

The hosts rallied back with Stephy Mavididi, Alex Iwobi and the highly-rated Dan Crowley all testing 15-year-old Mile Svillar. Svillar is already being touted as the next Thibaut Courtois.

in the 22nd minute, the young Gunners were finally rewarded for their efforts with a lovely goal through Crowley - a move that was reminiscent of the first-team in action.

Terrific inter-play between the 17-year-old and Chris Willock on the left-hand side of the penalty box saw Crowley in space on the edge of the Anderlecht box. Despite being under pressure, the creative midfielder had the compusure to pick out the bottom corner, leaving Svilar with no chance. 

Despite going into the interval all square, Arsenal were unable to push on from their unlike their visitors, who recorded a second successive win against their English opponents folliwing their eventful 4-3 victory a fortnight ago.

Defeat for the Gunners now means they need to ensure they get something from their final two matches against Borussia Dortmund and Galatasaray to progress.
