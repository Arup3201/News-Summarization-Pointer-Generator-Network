Jailed: Amanda Spencer, 23, has been jailed for 12 years for 'pimping out' vulnerable young girls

A YOUNG woman who forced vulnerable girls as young as 11 into prostitution was jailed for 12 years yesterday.

Amanda Spencer, 23, befriended the girls, plied them with drugs and  alcohol and made them have sex with strangers in parks, toilets and flats.

She became a ‘pimp’ at 15 and for five years ran a ring of teenage prostitutes to feed her addiction to drugs.

One victim said: ‘When I was 13 she made me feel it was normal to have sex. I wish I had never met her.

‘She took my childhood. I hate her and she ruined my life.’

Spencer showed no remorse as she was jailed for 16 child prostitution offences at Sheffield Crown Court.

Judge Michael Murphy said she had been responsible for the ‘heartless exploitation of young and vulnerable girls’, many of whom were in care.

She met the victims she called her ‘sisters’ hanging about in a market and park in Sheffield and took them under her wing to become their ‘best friend’.

Once they were in her control, Spencer forced them to dress provocatively, lie about their age and have sex with men.

The judge told her: ‘They didn’t have much of a childhood but what they had, you effectively spoiled. They looked up to you as their friend and as their protector. Unfortunately, what they found was not a protector but  an exploiter.’

The judge said he had watched the ‘torment and shame’ of the victims as they gave evidence  during the nine-week trial.

They were the most vulnerable witnesses he had seen in 40 years at the court, he added.

Spencer, of Rotherham, was convicted of 16 offences relating to five victims by a jury.

Spencer, pictured at Sheffield Crown Court, was found guilty of 14 counts of arranging or facilitating child prostitution and two counts of causing or inciting child prostitution against between 2006 and 2011

She was cleared of eight offences.

The jury was unable to reach a decision on another 14 charges.

One
 victim was a 15-year-old homeless cocaine addict when she was forced to
 have sex with six ‘smiling’ Kurdish asylum seekers one after the other.

When she refused a 
seventh man, she was punched in the face by Spencer and relented. She 
said Spencer was paid £150 by the men and spent it on cocaine.

The court heard Spencer punched a 15-year-old victim when she refused her seventh sexual partner in a row

Spencer forced her to have sex with 40 or 50 men in two years and used cocaine and cannabis daily to ‘put her in a trance’.

The girl added: ‘I will carry with me what she made me do every day of my life.’

Another victim, who was forced to lose her virginity at 13, said Spencer befriended her when she was wearing her school uniform.

Later she was taken to a house party and agreed to have sex for £80 with a man in his 30s. The girl got £20 and Spencer took the rest.

Spencer forced one girl to have sex with 40 or 50 men over two years, the court heard

A girl of 14 said Spencer became her ‘best friend and family rolled into one’. She was then forced into prostitution.

‘She preyed on my weaknesses. I will be left with the mental and physical scars of what happened to me for the rest of my life.’

Spencer, who has a four-year-old son who lives with her parents in South Yorkshire, denied pimping any of the girls or working as a prostitute.

The court heard that she ran away from home on her 15th birthday, and was placed in foster care.

She became addicted to crack cocaine and would drink a bottle of spirits a day.

Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Chapman said Spencer had carried out ‘sustained and calculated abuse’ and ‘preyed on some of the most  vulnerable people in our community’.
