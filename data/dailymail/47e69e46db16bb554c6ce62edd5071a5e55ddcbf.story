Seven people were injured when lightning struck in a car park near to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers stadium following their NFL game against the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.

None of the injuries were serious though witnesses described the strike as like a bomb going off and one of those injured said it felt like being shot in the back.

Officials with Tampa Fire Rescue said all seven were taken to hospital with minor injuries.

Officials with Tampa Fire Rescue said seven people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries after a lightning strike in a car park near the Tampa Bay Buccaneers stadium

Heather Boone, 42, whose forehead required four stitches, told Yahoo! Sports: 'I felt like I got shot in the back.'

She added, in reference to the Packers: 'I took one for the team.'

Another victim, 44-year-old Adrian Vines, said: 'I heard a loud boom, and I was out.' Both he and father-in-law John Allen were reportedly knocked to the ground.

Witness Bruce Kudick, of Sarasota said the lightning appeared to hit the top of a car and 'shattered the top' of it.

He said: 'I never saw a streak. I just saw this huge flash. It was like the sound and the light was at the same time, so it was like a bomb went off.' 

Lightning reportedly hit a car's antennae before the victims were injured on Sunday afternoon 

Fellow Packers fan Rudy Hynek added: 'The boom came at the same time as the light did. It was like the speed of sound type thing. And it was loud.

'It scared the heck out of everybody. It was amazing nobody was killed.'

Tampa Bay Fire and Rescue spokesman Jason Penny said nobody was directly struck by the lightning bolt, which occurred just after 4pm.

He added that it kicked up rocks and stones in the car park and knocked a few people to the ground. The Packers defeated the Buccaneers 20-3.

Spokesman Jason Penny says it doesn't appear that anyone was directly struck by the lightning bolt
