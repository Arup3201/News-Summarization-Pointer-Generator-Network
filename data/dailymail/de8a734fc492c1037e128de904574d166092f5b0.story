Jemima Khan's two sons have grown up in a world of immense privilege. 

Sulaiman Isa, 17, and Qasim, 15, will never want for material items and have a good chance of extremely successful careers ahead of them through their network of family contacts. 

It is is something that Jemima, a tireless campaigner for reufgees throughout the world in her role as a Unicef UK Ambassador, never fails to remind them.

The 40-year-old has revealed that she is constantly aware of how lucky her children have it while she is visiting conflict zones and coming across boys who are the same age.

Jemima Khan wants to raise awareness of plight of Syrian children, so she has launched the Wake Up Call selfie for Unicef

Over the last fifteen years, she has come across several instances where children are acting sometimes twenty years older than her own boys, shouldering responsibilities that would often be too much for a fully grown man. 

One of the first moments of realisation came when she was distributing supplies to a refugee camp in Pakistan 13 years ago.  

Speaking on the Lorraine show earlier today, she said: 'I met this seven-year-old boy, who was just a little bit older than my own son. 

'It’s really hard not to make those comparisons.

'I’d taken tents in (to this camp) to distribute because the Pakistani government were not recognising them as refugees and allowing the aid charities to go in.

'It was during the monsoon and it was the most terrible situation.

'This seven year old boy was trying to put a 25 kilo (four stone) tent on his back and I went up to him and said, “Get one of your family members to help you, get the head of the household.”

'He explained that he was the head of the household - his mother had died in the camp, his father had died in the fighting, but more than that, he had four younger siblings that he was caring for, including a tiny baby.

Jemima Khan appeared on Lorraine today to talk about her campaign 

'This 7 year old boy had taken on the responsibility of an adult and when I thought about my seven-year-old son who could barely run a bath unsupervised at that point, you see this huge difference. 

'When you meet a child like that who is seven years old and has no concept of what being a normal child is like, that really affected me.' 

Jemima experienced a similar situation more recently, while visiting a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. 

The heiress has revealed she came into contact with a teenager who was the same age as her eldest son, who made her realise how much her boys take their opportunities for granted. 

She said: 'I’ve just been to  the Syrian refugee camp in Jordan and the situation is very desperate.

'The child that captures my imagination is the one that is the same age as my child now, so when I was in Syria in Jordan in the refugee camp this time, there was this 17 year old boy.

'I have a 17 year old boy and a 15 year old boy now.

'This 17 year old boy - his greatest wish in life was to be able to go to school, but he was having to go to work to support his family.

'He was having to do this menial work, but he was desperate to become a civil engineer.

'He was this serious boy who doesn’t watch TV, who was quite politicised and very gentle, but all he wanted was to be able to go to school and to be able to go to university 

'And I think about my kids and how I have to employ every tactic available to get them to do their homework, how lucky they are and how complacent they are about the immense privilege that they grow up in.' 

These experiences are two of many that convinced Jemima to spearhead the Wake Up Call Selfie with Unicef to raise money for children in Syria. 

She said: 'I’ve been working for Unicef for thirteen years now, it happened after I’d been to the refugee camp in Pakistan. 

Tom Hiddleston and Stephen Fry have both participated in the #wakeupcall selfie 

'When I set up an appeal for those children, Unicef approached me and said that they do that in every conflict zone, so I’ve been working with them for some time.

'In terms of this (Wake Up Call selfie campaign) being about Syria, I feel that we’ve been focusing on the military heavily and I want to put the humanitarian side back into the focus.

'There are 6.5 million children who are now in real desperate need.'

She is hoping that people will be inspired to get involved with the craze in a similar way to the ice bucket challenge and the no make-up selfie. 

She said: 'I hope it will catch on with the public, because the eye make-up challenge and the ice bucket challenge did so well.

You just have to take a selfie when you’ve just woken up, post it on social media with the hashtag #wakeupcall , donate money to Unicef and then nominate three other people.' 

Claudia Winkleman and Nigella Lawson have also contributed pictures of themselves waking up in the morning 

The campaign has been popular among celebrities recently, but has had some backlash among members of the public who have criticised the idea of fame-hungry stars wanting more exposure on social media. 

But Jemima defended those celebrities, revealing it is actually all her fault.  

She said: 'I know that people get irritated by these campaigns. They think it’s about narcissistic celebs just wanting to put pics of themselves on social media.

But the truth is, what’s really unfair is most of those people who’ve done it so far have been begged by me.

People like Nigella Lawson – I had to beg her to do it, she doesn’t do selfies, she just talks about cooking on Twitter.

She said it was too cheesy and forced and I had to beg her to do it, so I feel really bad for them when everyone goes, “Ugh, these celebrities just want to do this to get their face on social media."'
