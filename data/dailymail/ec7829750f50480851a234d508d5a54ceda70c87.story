Vladimir Putin’s opponents are claiming there is something fishy about the Russian president’s latest macho antics.

The 60-year-old was pictured wearing camouflage fatigues and proudly showing off a monster pike he supposedly caught on holiday in Siberia.

But his critics are now accusing him of falling into the classic amateur fisherman’s trap of exaggerating the size of his catch.

Catch: Russian President Vladimir Putin fishing at the Tokpak-Khol lake in the Tyva Republic in Siberia, Russia

On the water: The images were clearly aimed at proving that Mr Putin is still comfortable in raw nature and has the physical energy to catch a huge fish and lead his nation in changing times

Athletic: The Kremlin announced that the Russian leader managed to catch a 46lb pike while on a trip to the remote region of Tuva, providing TV footage and pictures of him stripped to the waist as he cast his line

The Kremlin announced that the 
Russian leader managed to catch a 46lb (21kg) pike while on a trip to 
the remote region of Tuva, providing television footage and pictures of 
the president stripped to the waist as he cast his line.

The images were 
clearly aimed at proving that Mr Putin is still comfortable in raw 
nature and has the physical energy to catch a huge fish and lead his 
nation in changing times.

The size of the president’s pike, in 
particular, was rubbished by his detractors who said it could only have 
weighed half of the official Kremlin estimate.

Blogger and author Alfred Kokh 
calculated the length, diameter and volume of the fish and said it could
 only have weighed ‘10-11kg' and not 21kg.

Pro-opposition journalist Oleg Kashin
 added that a fish with the density of a 21kg pike the size of the 
one caught by Mr Putin would simply have sunk to the bottom of the lake.

‘A pike that heavy just could not 
swim,’ Mr Kashin wrote on Twitter. ‘She would sink to the bottom! In 
fact this pike was made from granite.’

‘Wonder
 who planted that fish for Putin to catch,’ said a caption placed under 
two online pictures - one of Mr Putin holding the fish and the other 
showing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev emerging from a river in a 
wetsuit with a satisfied look.

Mr
 Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov rubbished the claims, which he blamed 
on ‘it being summer, there’s nothing to do, people need to talk.’

‘I
 personally saw the scales and was present at the weighing. The pike 
really weighed more than 20kg,’ he told the Russian News Service.

The
 pro-Kremlin mass-circulation daily Komsomolskaya Pravda showed no such 
suspicions, devoting a whole page to pictures of Mr Putin in his 
camouflage outfit and fawning commentary.

A video was also released showing Mr Putin petting reindeer and driving a motor boat.

Telling the truth? Critics are now accusing Mr Putin of falling into the classic amateur fisherman's trap of exaggerating the size of his catch

In the air: When Mr Putin flew with migrating storks last year on the Yamal Peninsula, he was mocked online

Famous photograph: Mr Putin has often burnished his image since first coming to power with outdoor exploits such as riding a horse with a bare torso (pictured, in August 2009) and shooting a tiger with a tranquiliser

Mr Putin has often burnished his image since first coming to power in 2000 with outdoor exploits such as riding a horse with a bare torso and shooting a tiger with a tranquiliser.

But the Kremlin admitted under pressure that a stunt in 2011, in which Mr Putin found ancient artefacts at the bottom of the Black Sea, was staged. When he flew with migrating storks last year, he was widely mocked online.

It later emerged that the cranes had failed to migrate and had ended up being transported by plane to fenced enclosures in nature reserves.

Mr Putin remains Russia’s most popular politician, with a recent opinion poll showing his trust level at 45 per cent, but his authority was dented by mass protests in Moscow and other big cities that began in late 2011 and carried on into 2012.
