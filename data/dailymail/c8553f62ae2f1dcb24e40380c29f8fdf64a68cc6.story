Tottenham will face UEFA sanctions following the farcical pitch invasions during Thursday’s Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade.

And it emerged on Friday that the three men arrested for running on to the White Hart Lane surface are serial pranksters.

Mauricio Pochettino’s side booked their place in the knockout stages with a 1-0 win, Benjamin Stambouli scoring the winner.

But the clash was marred by three separate pitch invasions and UEFA said in a statement yesterday that its control, ethics and disciplinary body would hear the charge against Tottenham on December 11.

European football’s governing body have a wide-ranging list of punishments for the offence of ‘field invasions’.

They include a warning, a fine and even a points deduction. However, it seems likely the club will receive a hefty fine.

The game was suspended for just under 10 minutes following three interruptions in the first half.

The three men, who all wore T-shirts with the name of an audio company emblazoned across them, spent Thursday night in police custody.

It emerged on Friday that the trio — Gomes Garcia, Nathan Brown and Dan Jarvis — are believed to be part of a group called TrollStation, whose internet prank videos have gone viral.

Their previous stunts include turning a Tube carriage into a strip club and faking a kidnapping.

TrollStation also posted a video on their YouTube where they set up a 'strip club' on the London Underground

A TrollStation video, uploaded to YouTube late on Thursday night, starts with Gomes introducing the prank and his fellow pitch invaders ‘Nathan’ and ‘Jarvis’. He says: ‘Today we’re going to see who lasts longer on the pitch.’

The audio firm, who supply football-branded merchandise and advertise on Tottenham’s official website, have released a statement distancing themselves from the actions.

Nevertheless, Spurs have taken the decision to stop any affiliation with them through all their official channels.

UEFA have also confirmed that Mousa Dembele and Roberto Soldado of Spurs will not face disciplinary action after they tried to tackle two of the invaders.

Meanwhile, Harry Kane says Tottenham will have ‘no excuse’ if they fail to end their awful post-Europa League form against Everton in the Barclays Premier League tomorrow.

Spurs have struggled to deal with the demands of domestic football following their European exertions, especially at home. Liverpool, West Brom, Newcastle and Stoke have all won at White Hart Lane in games following the Europa League this season.

Kane said: ‘That is what we have got to look to change if we want to do well in the Premier League and hopefully we can start against Everton.

‘There is no excuse because they played on Thursday night as well. It should be a good game.’

On Thursday’s farcical scenes, Kane added: ‘The first one was quite funny and I had a little chuckle to myself. But then it got a bit stupid in the end. We dealt with it well.’ 

Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard faces Tottenham having set his team-mates the target of qualifying for the Champions League, insisting they are better than when they finished fifth last season.

Roberto Martinez’s men are only two points off fourth-placed Manchester United and despite a lengthening injury list, Howard is confident they can emulate the team under David Moyes that qualified in 2005.

Howard, who was outstanding in Thursday’s 2-0 win in Wolfsburg that booked Everton’s place in the knockout stages of the Europa League, said: ‘We stuttered a bit at the start but when we play well we will have no problem. Last year we finished fifth and we are a stronger team now. The purpose is top four. We’ll fix our sights on that and see how we go.’

Everton’s European campaign has come at a cost in terms of injuries. James McCarthy limped off against Wolfsburg with a hamstring injury and joins John Stones, Steven Naismith, Antolin Alcaraz and Gareth Barry on the casualty list. Leighton Baines, Bryan Oviedo, Darron Gibson and Steven Pienaar also missed the trip to Germany.
