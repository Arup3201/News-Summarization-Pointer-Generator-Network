Warrnambool is a country town which has one of the highest rates of child abuse in Australia, but the local council still dithers over whether to destroy a mural painted by convicted paedophile Rolf Harris, all in the name of art.

Outspoken Councillor Peter Hulin has led the charge to have the earthy outback landscape removed but says he's being stonewalled. He says Monday is D-day for his colleagues to show where they really stand.

'It shouldn't be there any more, it's wrong on all levels, we should paint over it now and be done with it,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

The Rolf Harris mural is currently covered up by a dark perspex. He painted it during a performance at the Lighthouse Theatre in 1986. Critics say local government officials must make a decision to either remove the cover and leave the painting in place ore remove it from view altogether

Warrnambool City Councillors Peter Hulin (left) and Mayor Michael Neoh (right). Cllr Hulin is leading the charge to have the Rolf Harris mural at the local theatre destroyed. He and his colleagues will again debate the issue on Monday night, a matter which has bitterly divided the community for more almost eight months now. The mayor said 'I have no right to destroy someone's art'

Warrnambool, is in Victoria's south-west, with a population of more than 33,000. It was gifted the mural back in 1986, when Harris painted it during a performance at the local Lighthouse Theatre.

'It sends the wrong message completely and anyone who argues that it's only in the loading dock area is wrong too, that's where kids get ready to perform,' he added.

'They are walking past it every day, we have to send the message that there is zero tolerance for this sort of crap.'

He said many critics of the council have taken to blogs and websites calling it 'shameful'  and accusing officials of 'hiding behind perspex'.

Daily Mail Australia has obtained a copy of the executive summary, to be reviewed by the seven councillors on Monday, March 2.

Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown Court to face sentencing on 12 counts of indecent assault on July 4, 2014 in London. The 84 -year-old entertainer was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls between 1968 and 1986, he was arrested in March 2013 by police officers working on Operation Yewtree

By their (council's) own admission: 'The rates of violence against women and children across Warrnambool are significantly higher than the Victorian state average.'

And, according to the internal report, many in the community believe 'the art work of Rolf Harris not of significant value'. Against that, the council says the consultation after his conviction also found that 'it would set a bad precedent to destroy the artwork of an artist because his/her behaviour was deemed criminal'.

Harris was jailed for five years and nine months last July for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986, the same year he painted the mural at Warrnambool.

The mural Rolf Harris (pictured leaving court) painted in the loading dock of Warrnambool's Lighthouse Theatre in 1986 is the subject of a bitter dispute in the Victorian town, many locals fear the local council will put the issue in the 'too hard basket' and leave the mural in place 

Frank Penhalluraick, a Melbourne paint store owner, wasted no time making his feelings known. Here he is pictured painting over a Rolf Harris mural on his shop wall in protest against the disgraced entertainer

The three options the council have been given 'to explore' but not necessarily decide on Monday night are:

To destroy the mural, to leave it in place but covered and work on the prevention of violence against women and children and, thirdly, to leave it in place, covered, but with a plaque next to it to outline council's commitment to the prevention of violence against women and children.

Councillor Hulin believes his preference to do away with the painting will not be supported.

'I think, maybe, two of us support it being destroyed,' he said.

'This is not censorship, like some bloke was claiming the other day, that it was like the Nazis burning books, that's just rubbish.'

He was referring to claims by Adam Kempton, an art collector and a former Victorian member of parliament.

But the disgraced entertainer's has already experienced a backlash against his work and achievements down under.

Work he completed at a Melbourne paint store has already been removed, by owner Frank Penhalluraick.

He has also been stripped of two major Australian honours in a decision gazetted by Governor-General Peter Cosgrove.

'It is notified that the Governor-General has terminated the appointments of Officer and Member of the Order of Australia in the General Division made to Mr Rolf Harris,' the notice from Mark Fraser, the Secretary of the Order of Australia, said.

The news coming amid revelations that the convicted paedophile could be earning as much as $2500 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments.

The mayor of Warrnambool, Michael Neoh, told Daily Mail Australia that 'I have no right to destroy someone else's artwork'.

'It’s not like a traditional piece of artwork, on a canvas or something, so it’s not something that you can take down and store away like many galleries have done, not only in Australia but elsewhere,' Mayor Neoh added.

'The council officers have recommended that we maintain the status they’ve got a bit of perspex over it, that’s the recommendation, to keep it out of public view.

'My personal position is that Warrnambool City Council does a lot of work around violence against women and children and we’ve got a number of strategies in place, I don’t know that I have got the right to destroy anyone's art.

'We don’t condone what he did, we’ve come out very strongly and said we find it repulsive but I don’t have the right to destroy anyone’s art.

The mayor believes the issue has been blown out of proportion.

'We’ve had it covered for 3 months, it’s been sensationalised by the media and at least one councillor has been very passionate about it,' he added.

'Some local artists have been asked about it and said it should go because it’s not a good piece of work, that’s not the criteria.

'And I don’t want to make light of this ... but someone said to me there were suggestions about Michael Jackson, does that mean that radio stations shouldn’t play Michael Jackson any more?

'Again, on the arts side I don’t think I have the right to deface or destroy someone’s piece of art.'

One of his colleagues, however, is in no doubt. 

'The painting has to go. We waited for the decision and whatever appeal process, enough already,' Cllr Hulin said.
