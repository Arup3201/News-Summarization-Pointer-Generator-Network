Cure for the meds: Quit sugar to avoid gaining weight when you are put on steroids

I am on long-term corticosteroids to treat a rheumatic condition which means I have very stiff joints – especially my shoulders, upper arms and hips.

One of the side effects is that I have gained weight which I find impossible to shift.

Is it pointless trying to diet and exercise if the drugs are making me bigger?

No. Many people experience weight gain when they start taking steroids, as one of the side effects is an increased appetite. 

But this means it is also possible  to control. This is actually a great opportunity to clean up your diet.

Cut out added sugar. It’s high calorie and the latest research suggests it triggers weight gain by affecting our body chemistry, too.

Of course sugar is a natural component of whole foods, but this isn’t the problem. Do you drink fizzy pop? How about a teaspoon in tea or coffee?

Alcohol is high calorie and often laden with sugar – there are online calculators that will tell you how many extra calories your daily tipple adds. Even modest regular drinkers are usually in for a shock.

Check the ingredients of any pre-prepared foods, as there’s hidden sugar in many supermarket products.

Also be wary of honey and other sweet syrups - these are basically pure sugar and empty calories. Fruit juices and smoothies are high in sugar albeit natural.

I Quit Sugar, by Sarah Wilson, is a great new book about all the health benefits – including weight loss – of a sugar-free diet.

All weight loss is achieved by limiting calories consumed and maximising what you’re burning off, so exercise is also key.

Even committing to walking for 30 minutes a day will be a start. But if you really want to burn some calories, then you can’t beat High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT).

Search on YouTube for hundreds of these short, intense workouts. Often, an entire workout can take just ten minutes. Good luck!

I’ve read that even skinny children can be storing up health problems if they don’t exercise. That’s my teenage grandson! He spends his spare time playing computer games.

What can we do to get him out of his bedroom? When we were that age, we played outdoors and I’ve never had to diet or worry about things like the gym. I’m 83, and still wear clothes I bought in my 30s.

Turn it off: Even a slim person needs to turn the computer off and get up and exercise for their health

You’re right, staying fit well into old age isn’t just about size. A recent study looked at how inactivity in childhood led to fat deposits accumulating around the organs – hence the acronym TOFI: Thin Outside, Fat Inside.

Establishing regular exercise early in life lowers the risk of most degenerative diseases, including diabetes, heart disease and some forms of cancer.

In America, sport is ingrained in the culture. It’s a shame sports aren’t so popular among British teens.

As your grandson loves his computer, a Nintendo Wii with physically active games, could be a good investment.

Before I came to America, people warned me about ‘the New York stone’ – referring to the weight gain many experience when they move to the city.

Eating out, larger portions  and food that’s more heavily processed are the main culprits. Luckily, discovering the city’s vibrant workout culture first meant I didn’t fall prey to it.

I have noticed changes in  my digestion, though, and developed some food intolerances since my move.

Here’s a luxurious way to beat the heat: A cooling spray containing none of the additives or chemical nasties that shop-bought brands can contain.

Empty atomiser  spray bottles can be purchased cheaply online or at department stores, so you can have one by the bed and one for your bag or desk drawer.

This is not to be used as a sun block, but the anti-inflammatory properties of  aloe vera mean that it’s a great treatment for sunburn.

Witch-hazel soothes the skin and helps reduce swelling. Eucalyptus oil gives a fresh aroma and has a cooling sensation, as does peppermint oil, which can also be used as an alternative, or addition.

Essential oils may not be suitable for pregnant women or those with some medical conditions – consult your doctor before using this spray.

INGREDIENTS- 50ml water- 25ml aloe vera juice. Look for a brand containing nothing but aloe inner gel such as the one by Pukka (£8.96, 500ml, pukkaherbs.com). It’s 99.8 per cent pure with just some lemon juice as a preservative. You can find 100 per cent pure on the internet. These are usually marketed as drinks but are perfect for putting on skin too. - 25ml distilled witch-hazel liquid- 5 drops of eucalyptus  and/or peppermint essential oil, or three drops of each

DIRECTIONSMix ingredients into a bowl and decant into an atomiser spray bottle. Shake well before use and spritz your face and body when hot. Can be stored in the fridge for two to three months.

Tackling these problems means I now follow a mainly vegan diet – I eat no dairy at all, but occasionally fish or eggs.

Food blogger Aine Carlin, pictured, has a similar story. After moving from England to the States, her American diet left her feeling lethargic and lumpen, and she, too, started eating vegan – not because of animal rights, but for her health.

And if this instantly conjures up images of endless plates of tasteless mung beans, then her new recipe book, Keep It Vegan, should change your mind.

I love the sound of dishes like Smokey Moroccan Stew and Crunchy Curried Chickpea Tacos, and you don’t need eggs or cream to make her desserts.

If that wasn’t enough to tempt you, the well-publicised health benefits of a vegan diet (as spelled out in the American cult documentary Forks Over Knives) include everything from lowered blood pressure to reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes and other diseases.

A lessening in the environmental impact of factory farming and the needless suffering of animals is just an added bonus.

IN the past year, the Duchess  of Cambridge has been photographed playing volleyball, cricket, the South African game of three tins at the Commonwealth games (above), running along a sandy beach and doing hurdles – all while wearing vertiginous heels.

And now it seems as if Princess Eugenie is getting in on the act.

She was last week photographed posing with a hockey stick wearing Kate’s heel of choice: wedges. What is it with the Royals and wedges? Perhaps the girls are following in the heels of the  fictional Carrie Bradshaw – from Sex And The City – who was  forever sprinting down the streets of New York in Manolos.

But they should be careful. Despite ‘high-heel workouts’ growing in popularity, it seems more than a little dangerous to me.

I’ve had too many sprained ankles from just walking in high heels, let alone taking to the treadmill in them.

Americans are obsessed with their teeth, and it seems as if everybody here has a perfect movie-star smile.

Flossing is a favourite national pastime, while most wear braces as children and then have their teeth bleached white. It’s no wonder, then, that the ancient Ayurvedic practice of oil pulling is the latest health craze.

Said to remove harmful bacteria and plaque build-up, as well as whiten teeth naturally, oil pulling involves swishing a tablespoonful of oil around in your mouth for ten to 15 minutes each morning – before eating, drinking or brushing your teeth – then spitting it out.

I’ve been trying it, and it’s not as disgusting as it sounds. I use coconut oil as I like the taste, and swish it about as I make breakfast.
