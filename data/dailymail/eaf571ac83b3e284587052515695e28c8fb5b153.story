Saying it's time to stop letting convicted killers 'get off that easy,' a Florida state lawmaker wants to use firing squads or the electric chair for those on death row.

Rep. Brad Drake, 36, filed a bill this week that would end the use of lethal injection in Florida executions. Instead, those with a death sentence would choose between electrocution or a firing squad.

'I say let's end the debate. We still have Old Sparky. And if that doesn't suit the criminal, then we will provide them a .45-caliber lead cocktail instead,' Drake said.

Florida state Rep. Brad Drake (R) has introduced legislation to bring back the firing squad for executions, an idea he came up with sitting at a Waffle House last month

'There shouldn't be anything controversial about a .45-caliber bullet,' he told the Florida Current.

'If it were up to me, we would just throw them off the Sunshine Skyway bridge and be done with it.'

Drake, a Republican, said the idea came to him after having a conversation with a constituent at a Waffle House over the legal battles associated with the September 28 execution of Manuel Valle.

Valle's lawyers tried to stop the execution by arguing that a new lethal drug cocktail would cause him pain and therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Courts, however, rejected that argument and let the execution go forward.

But Drake said the person at the restaurant questioned why death row inmates should even be allowed to die by lethal injection. Drake said he agreed and decided to sponsor the bill that would mandate a switch.

The GOP-controlled Florida Legislature will consider the bill during the 2012 session that starts in January.

'There shouldn't be anything controversial about a .45-caliber bullet,' Drake said of his plan, even though Florida has never used a firing squad before

He said government is spending too much 
time listening to advocacy groups and instead should put in place a 
death sentence that forces convicted murderers to contemplate their 
fates.

The execution of Manuel Valle, 61, killed by the new lethal injection cocktail, started Drake thinking about 'cruel and unusual punishment'

Lethal injection just allows a person to die in their sleep while a firing squad or electrocution would force death row inmates to think about their punishment 'every morning,' Drake said.

'I think if you ask a hundred people, not even talking to criminals, how would you like to die, if you were drowned, if you were shot, and if you say you were put to sleep, 90 percent of some of the people would say I want to be put to sleep,' Drake said.

'Let's put our pants back on the right way.'

Florida first began using the electric chair in 1924. Before then, most executions were carried out by hanging.

Florida has never used firing squads.

But the state switched to lethal injection in 2000. Then-Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature pushed through the change after several botched electrocutions raised concerns that the state's death penalty would be declared unconstitutional.

The U.S. Supreme Court had agreed at the time to hear a challenge to the use of the electric chair.

Drake also advocates using Old Sparky, the Florida electric chair seen here. Florida stopped electrocuting inmates in 2000 and has never used a firing squad

Since the state made the switch, a total of 26 people have died by lethal injection, including Valle and serial killers Danny Rolling and Aileen Wuornos.

The last state to use a firing squad was Utah, which executed inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010, the first death by firing squad in the United States in 14 years.

The state has stopped using firing squads.

Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said Drake's legislation would just cause embarrassment for Florida if it were adopted.

'Just when you thought that public policy in Florida couldn't get worse, along comes a state rep who develops proposed legislation from what he overhears at the Waffle House,' Simon said.

'Given all that former members of the Florida Supreme Court and the American Bar Association have said about Florida's broken death penalty system, including the nation's highest number of exonerations, this would be embarrassing – if our legislature were capable of embarrassment.'

But Drake said that those who caused suffering and grief for families should get their day of reckoning.

'I just don't think they should be able to get off that easy,' he said.
