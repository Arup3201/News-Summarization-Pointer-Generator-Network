Roy Hodgson has revealed Wayne Rooney has taken physiotherapists on holiday with him this week to ensure he’s in prime condition when his England squad meets up next week.

Hodgson has told those players bound for the World Cup in Brazil to take a break this week, to rest and recharge their batteries after a long season.

Rooney has been nursing a slight groin injury through the end of the season and has not played since Manchester United’s win against Norwich on April 26.

He is not considered by Hodgson to be a doubt in any way and England will to have their talisman hungry to show what he can do when they arrive in Rio.

'If it's up to Wayne and wanting to do it, there's no doubt,' said Hodgson. 'We have nothing to fear with Wayne in that respect.

Time to shine: Rooney has endured a succession of injury-hit and frustrating tournaments with England

'I'm more than happy for the players to forget football for a week and get mentally prepared for the weeks ahead, but Wayne has decided to take some physios with him and continue his programme so, when we meet up on the 19th, he'll be able to join in straight away.

'He has the attitude and desire. Has he got the ability? Yes he has. Let's hope he can show the form that makes Wayne Rooney what he is.'

Since making a huge impression at Euro 2004, Rooney has failed to sparkle in big tournaments for England.

His first World Cup in 2006 was preceded by injury fears and ended in a red card and he was subdued in South Africa four years later. At Euro 2012, he was banned for the first two group games.

Hodgson was quick to play down fears that Rooney would again be carrying an injury into a major tournament with England and revealed his only slight concern was over the striker's United team-mate Phil Jones. 

'We wouldn’t have selected anybody in this 23 if we seriously thought we’d be on tenterhooks with regards to his fitness,' said the England boss. 

'The only one I’d say that seriously still poses a question is Phil Jones. His shoulder injury was a week ago. Everyone tells me and my research tells me that it’s a three week injury to be back fit and playing but we can’t guarantee that and as a result John Stones will be his replacement if we are not confident he will be fit.'
