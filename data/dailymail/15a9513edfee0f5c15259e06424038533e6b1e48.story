Convicted: Waseem Daker, now 35, spent a decade behind bars for stalking Loretta Blatz and now he is on trial for killing her roommate

A man accused of stalking a woman on his paintball team before killing her roommate was found with how-to manuals about getting away with murder, a court was told.

Prosecutors in the Waseem Daker murder
trial showed jurors that when the 35-year-old was arrested in 2009 police also found rope and
handcuffs in his 
possession.

Jurors in Marietta, Georgia, were 
presented with 12-year-old emails that prosecutors say prove Daker 
obtained disturbing materials before committing murder.

The 
'how-to' titles were titled 'How to get Away with Murder' and 'Kill Without 
Joy', ABC News reported.

Daker allegedly strangled flight attendant Karmen Smith to death in 
1995 and stabbed her then five-year-old son, Nick Smith, 18 times  as an act of revenge against her roommate,
Loretta Spencer Blatz, who helped send him to prison for harassing her.

Just before going to serve a 10-year prison sentence for stalking 
Blatz, prosecutors say Daker allegedly killed Smith.

Daker is acting as his own 
attorney which has made for some 
awkward questioning when Blatz and Nick Smith took the stand.

Judge Mary
Staley has nearly lost her cool a few times in this case, clearly 
annoyed with Daker's courtroom antics, ABC News reported.

'There are numerous occasions 
during the trial that your veracity has been in strong question by me. 
Strong!' said Staley. She added, 'And you don't try cases by ambush.'

Daker had long been a suspect in 
Karmen Smith's murder, but it wasn't until 2009 that, according to 
authorities, tests showed hairs found on Smith's body matched Daker's 
DNA.

Daker and prosecutors are fighting
over those very DNA tests from the scene of the crime that police say 
cracked the case and led to his arrest.

Daker questioned homicide 
detective John Dawes on Monday, and asked why police did not submit every 
piece of evidence for DNA testing.

Dawes explained that once they had Daker's DNA linking him to the crime scene there was no need for more tests.

'Which is more expensive? Doing a 
DNA test or sending an innocent man to prison?' asked Daker, which drew 
prosecutors into a frenzy, demanding an objection from the judge.

Scene: At the time of her murder, Karmen Smith lived in the basement apartment of the house on Old Hunter's Trace (pictured) where Loretta Blatz lived in Marietta, Georgia,

Last Tuesday, Nick Smith, now 22, took the stand on what would have been his mother's birthday.

'From what I could tell it was a 
man, but it was really dark and I just assumed that it was someone that I
knew... The person in the room grabbed me and started stabbing me a 
bunch and I tried to yell and he covered my mouth and then he kept 
stabbing me,' Smith said.

Smith said he remembered a gloved 
hand over his mouth. He said his assailant was also wearing a black mask
that covered his face. He said because of the mask he wasn't able to 
get a good look at his attacker.

On September 14, Blatz took the stand 
and was clearly rattled having to be grilled by the man imprisoned for 
stalking her relentlessly and accused of murdering her roommate.

After several hours of 
questioning, Blatz fought back against Daker when he asked the judge to 
label her testimony during his questioning as 'inappropriate.'

'Well, you know, it's really 
inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you're sitting here 
asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your 
questions, that's hard for me,' she said, breaking down and sobbing.

'I didn't realize this was going 
to turn into murder. My God, I mean, if I would have known I would have 
taken notes,' she told the court.

Daker denies the charges.
