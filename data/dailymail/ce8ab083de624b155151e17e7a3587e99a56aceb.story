A man was shot in the chest on early Friday morning after he tried to break into the Las Vegas home of a former girlfriend, according to police.

The incident happened about 1 a.m. and police say the unidentified woman called 911 complaining that an ex-boyfriend was kicking down her door. 

Police have named the male accused of breaking into the apartment as 22-year-old Douglas Eugene Jackson.

An unidentified woman has said that she forced to shot an ex-boyfriend twice after he forced entry into her apartment at 1 a.m. on Friday. This photo was posted online and shows her battered front door

The woman, who has asked not to be named, later posted a blog post in which she appeared to confess to shooting her ‘stalker’.

She told FOX5 that although she was in a relationship with Jackson for a month, she ‘wouldn’t qualify [it] as romantic.’

According to police, Jackson forced his way into the apartment and the woman fired two shots, one hitting him directly in the chest, police said.

Jackson then ran away, but was found hiding in bushes by a K-9 unit and arrested.

The victim has shared a series of screenshots she said detailed numerous texts and online messages from Jackson

In her blog post, titled 'I shot my stalker tonight', the victim explained that she was forced to move, get a restraining order, and obtain a concealed carry permit after Jackson started ‘stalking’ her. 

The post also included a photo believed to show her front door after it had been forced open.

The victim sent FOX5 a series of screenshots she said detailed numerous texts and online messages from Jackson. 

She also said she had been sleeping with a chair in front of her door to keep her stalker out.  

I'm writing this staring at the mess the police left for me, in a bit of a fog. 

After 6 months of stalking and threats against my life my stalker finally snapped and decided to kick my door in and make good on his promise.

 Out of fear, the past month I had begun sleeping with a chair propped against my front door, to give myself a few extra precious seconds in case of emergency. I shudder to think how differently things might've turned out had I not barricaded the door.

I awoke around 1:15 am to the sound of the door giving way after one kick followed by the sounds of my stalker struggling to dislodge the chair while forcing his way inside. I jumped up and grabbed the gun I've learned to do everything even shower with.

I stood at the top of my stairs and fired twice. Hitting him in the chest, I hear his scream, his disbelief that I'd stood up for myself.. 0 to 100 in milliseconds. I've never been so afraid in my life. I do not know if he is living, but I do know the police have him and that's what helps the most.

For months of him evading the police I began to question whether he was unstoppable. Untraceable. Houdini, he would murder me and get away with it. 

As of now I'm in a haze of guilt, surprise, relief and disbelief. I shook as the canines drag him out from his hiding place under a bush. I survived, where so many people do not. Holy s***, I survived.

Edit: The outpouring of support is WILD. I cant thank you guys enough. Everyone can be a critic and the fact still remains, you don't know what you will do in a situation until its presented in front of you.

Those who believe there was other things to be done have never had someone tell you that you no longer deserve to draw breath and mean it.

And for the 'should've fired a warning shot' folks: There are no warning shots, a gun is a deadly force, you only pull that trigger if you are in fear for your life and all other methods of deterring are gone. When he kicked my door in, there was no longer a deterrent preventing harm. Warning shots are dangerous and could hurt the unintended. This is not a wild west movie.

That's what responsible gun ownership is. I'll update once things have calmed down a bit I promise.

I'll write back to everyone and after being isolated for so long, anyone who wants to be friends, I am always accepting those.
