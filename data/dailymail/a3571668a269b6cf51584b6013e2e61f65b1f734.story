The body of journalist Marie Colvin has arrived in Damascus, ten days after she was killed in a rocket attack on the beseiged city of Homs.

Syrian Red Crescent officials handed over the body of the Sunday Times journalist, along with that of French photographer Remi Ochlik, to embassy officials after being taken to the capital by ambulance.

The pair were killed when a makeshift media centre in the Baba Amr district of Homs was shelled last week.

Both
the journalists are believed to have previously been buried by Syrian 
opposition activists, who had said they could not store the bodies as 
they had no refrigeration facilities due to electricity cuts.

French Ambassador Eric Chevallier received the body of French photographer Ochlik, while a Polish diplomat received the remains of American-born Colvin. U.S. interests in Syria are represented by Poland.

The bodies, in brown coffins placed on stretchers, were transferred outside the Assad hospital in Damascus and driven away in an ambulance. The journalists' belongings were placed in black plastic bags.

Colvin, 56, a veteran foreign correspondent, and Ochlik, 28, a photojournalist, had sneaked into Syria illegally to get an eyewitness view of the government crackdown in the country, where thousands have been killed since a popular uprising began a year ago.

But they were trapped inside the besieged Baba Amr district of Homs, a target of heavy Syrian military shelling, and died on 22 February. The attack also wounded journalist Edith Bouvier of the daily Le Figaro and British photographer Paul Conroy, who had been working with Ms Colvin.

Yesterday Bouvier and French 
photographer William Daniels, who was not injured but also had been 
trapped in Homs, arrived in France on Friday after being smuggled 
through tunnels and snow from Syria into Lebanon.

Killed: activists said they had to bury Marie Colvin because there were no facilities to refrigerate it and it was beginning to decay

On Thursday, videos released by 
activists in Syria said Colvin and Ochlik had been buried in Baba Amr. 
But the Syrian government said the bodies had been disinterred and the 
government would repatriate them.

Red Cross spokesman Bijan Farnoudi said last night that the organisation had been given the remains of Ochlik and Colvin and would take them to Damascus.

Later, Polish Ambassador Michal Murkocinski and Chevallier identified their bodies at a Damascus morgue, according to Poland's Foreign Ministry. Polish diplomats, in consultation with the U.S., are trying to transport Colvin's body to the U.S. as soon as possible, the ministry said.

Red Crescent director in Syria Abdel-Rahman al-Attar said it was unclear when they will be flown out of the country.

Warning: Colvin's wounded Sunday Times colleague Paul Conroy, who escaped from Homs earlier this week, today said a 'massacre' is taking place in the Syrian city

Colvin's wounded Sunday Times colleague Paul Conroy, who escaped from Homs earlier this week, tonight said the city had
suffered a 'sustained barrage' of shelling.

The photographer, who was speaking 
from his hospital bed in Britain, told Sky News: 'It's not a war, it's a
massacre. 'An indiscriminate massacre of men, women and children.

Earlier this week Marie Colvin's mother Rosemarie had made
an emotional appeal for her daughter's remains to be repatriated.

Speaking to the BBC, she added: 'I 
didn't want her to be the cause or the reason but I do wish that her 
death does mean something and that perhaps it would help to end some of 
these terrible, terrible things that are happening.'

As well as killing Ochlik, the February 22 government rocket attack which also wounded French reporter Edith
Bouvier and British photographer Paul Conroy, who worked with Colvin for the Sunday Times.

Earlier in the week Conroy had refused to leave Homs without Colvin's body.

But
activists eventually smuggled Conroy, who was suffering from 
life-threatening injuries, and an uninjured reporter, Javier Espinosa of
Spain, 
out of the country into Lebanon in an extraordinary escape along a 20-mile smuggling route.

Thirteen Syrian activists 
in total were killed getting the two men out, according to the activist group 
Avaaz.

Colvin’s partner sent a message 
saying she had always been concerned about the living and 'please let no
more people die … for her body'.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy 
confirmed late last night Bouvier and William Daniels, another French 
journalist, escaped to Lebanon after being trapped in Baba Amr.
