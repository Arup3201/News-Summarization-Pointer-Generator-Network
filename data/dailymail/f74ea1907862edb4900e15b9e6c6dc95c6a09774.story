Luis Suarez's first appearance for Uruguay since sinking his teeth into the shoulder of Italy's Giorgio Chiellini saw the Barcelona forward produce a beautifully-controlled volley that created the opening goal - and leave the pitch to visit the toilet during the game.

The 27-year-old was named in the starting XI for the friendly fixture after his ban for four months and nine international matches was restricted to 'official matches only' by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on appeal. 

And Uruguay's No 9 set about proving why he should be given another chance by striking a right-footed volley that hit the post and forced an own goal from Hassan Muath Fallatah, before Saudi Arabia substitute Naif Hazazi equalised in the dying minutes.

Goal: Fallatah (OG, 47)

Suarez, who midway through the match asked for permission from the referee to run down the tunnel and visit the toilet, was clearly delighted to be back.

After the match, he said: 'Happy to wear this shirt again which gives me so much joy. You never lose your love for the shirt. Uruguay!' 

It took until the second half for Suarez to muster the chance for Uruguay in Jeddah, but it was single-handedly created by the controversial £75million striker.

Suarez won the initial free-kick after a rash challenge by Omar Hawsawi near the half-way line before peeling away from defenders to meet the resulting cross.

He hit the left post as  goalkeeper Abdullah Faisal Alarraf remained rooted, and defender Fallatah could do little to prevent the ball ricocheting off him into the back of his own net.

Suarez could and should have doubled Uruguay's lead in the 66th minute, too.

Latching on to a poor back pass, he found himself one-on-one with Abdullah, but the Saudi Arabia goalkeeper did well to get a palm to the ball as Suarez sluggishly tried to go  around.

Suarez, looking disgusted with himself for squandering the opportunity, was substituted for Hull City's Abel Hernandez shortly afterwards by manager Oscar Tabarez with 20 minutes remaining.

Uruguay had Fernando Muslera to thank for keeping their lead intact. The goalkeeper repeatedly denied Saudi Arabia but it did little good in the dying moments when a glancing header from Hazazi brought the teams level in the 90th minute.

Tabarez, previously asked to justify selecting Suarez for the friendly, told reporters last Friday: 'I will only speak with Luis Suarez about my thoughts.

'You must be humble and not judge. I know people have an opinion about it, but judging doesn't amuse me.'

But Suarez's efforts will please his new owners at the Nou Camp with his potential return to competitive football looming when Real Madrid verse Barcelona on October 25.

In a bizarre twist of fate, Chiellini scored both goals for Italy as they beat Azerbaijan 2-1 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday. The defender also found the wrong net to complete his hat-trick.
