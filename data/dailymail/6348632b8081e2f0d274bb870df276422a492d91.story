Ever wondered how the other half live? Look no further than China's annual fair for the super-rich.

The four day event in Sanya, Hainan Island Province, China, showcases the newest sports cars, yachts, jets and jewels from around the world.

And you would be hard-pressed to find anything on display that won't set you back a couple of hundred thousand pounds.

Fancy your own jet? This plane
