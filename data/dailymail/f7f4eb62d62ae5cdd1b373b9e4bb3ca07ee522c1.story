Winston McKenzie said letting same sex couples to adopt was a 'violation' of children's human rights

A leading member of the UK Independence Party has likened allowing gay people to adopt to ‘child abuse’.

Winston McKenzie, the party’s culture spokesman, said same sex couples should be banned from the adoption process, because it breached the human rights of children.

It comes as UKIP defends itself in the row with Rotherham council, which removed three foster children from a couple because they were party members.

Today it emerged the siblings have been separated from one another.

The boy has been sent to live with one family, while his two sisters – a baby and an older girl – have gone to another home.

The couple - who have already bought Christmas presents for the children - has now called on the leaders of Rotherham council to quit after they failed to apologise for what has happened.

Mr McKenzie is the UKIP candidate in this week’s by-election in Croydon North.

His remarks were condemned by campaigners and the party moved to distance itself from his comments.

Mr McKenzie, a former boxer, said: ‘To say to a child, “I am having you adopted by two men who kiss regularly but don’t worry about it” – that is abuse.

‘It is a violation of a child’s human rights because that child has no opportunity to grow up under normal circumstances’ he told Metro.

Mr McKenzie is a Christian and said gay adoption was against his religious beliefs.

He added: ‘There are people out there who bring up their kids encouraging them to believe they are gay themselves.’

He also used the interview to attack celebrities who come out as gay ‘as a fashion’.

David Coburn, UKIP’s London chairman who is gay, insisted Mr McKenzie’s views were not party policy.

‘We entirely, wholeheartedly support equal rights for couples regardless of their sexuality,’ he said.

Ben Summerskill, of gay rights charity Stonewall, said: ‘These 19th-century views are not acceptable in the 21st century.'

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has ruled out doing a deal with the Tories while David Cameron is still leader

The comments will be especially 
embarrassing for UKIP as leader Nigel Farage seeks to prove it is a 
mainstream party able to compete with the Tories.

He
 has this week attacked David Cameron over his 2006 claim that UKIP was 
made up of  'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly'.

The two parties have come to blows repeatedly, after Tory vice chairman Micahel Frabricant suggested an electoral pact with UKIP, to stop the anti-EU party snatching votes from the Conservatives which could deprive Mr Cameron of a majority at the next election.

Mr Farage rejected the idea, insisting 'it's war' with the Tories, but he left open the possibility that he could do a deal with a different Conservative leader.

'If Cameron went and somebody pragmatic, grown up and sensible like Michael Gove was leader, you might think then we could sit around the table and have a proper discussion... open-minded, doesn't throw abuse around and thinks issues through - he would be the right kind of person,' he said.

Today UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler, a former Tory donor, claimed to have held secret lunches with eight Tory MPs about defecting.

‘I
have had lunch, secretly if you like, in a completely confidential way 
with eight different Tory MPs,' he told the Daily Telegraph. While still
early days, he predicted ‘a few’ could switch parties.Read more: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2238912/Eight-Tories-talks-defect-UKIP-parties-war-electoral-pact.html#ixzz2DRBsme1M
