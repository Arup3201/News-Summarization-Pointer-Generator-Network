Lebron James is looking his thinnest ever in a new photo showing off the results of his new, low-carb diet.

In the photo posted to his Instagram account on Monday, Lebron's face show the dramatic weight-loss with more-defined cheekbones.

An ESPN reporter close to the all-star tweeted that day that Lebron had cut carbohydrates from his diet and had dropped 'significant' weight.

Svelte: LeBron James looks noticeably thinner in the face after cutting carbohydrates out of his diet

LeBron appears to be taking his training in the off-season seriously, after deciding to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers last month.

According to their roster, he is 6-foot-5 and weights 250 pounds.

In a move to show his re-dedication to the Cleveland community, Lebron and his two sons pitched in on Monday to help renovate a house for the family an 11-year-old in his Wheels for Education mentoring program.

Lebron took the controls of a backhoe Monday to help fix up sixth-grader Mariah Riley's crumbling house, with the help of songs LeBron Jr and Bryce.

The James boys pitched in to help remove the front steps, a retaining wall and some porch railings under the direction of reality TV show host Nicole Curtis. Work on the house will be featured later on Curtis' show 'Rehab Addict' on the HGTV network.

The Akron Beacon Journal reports that the work on the house in the West Hill neighborhood began Sunday. Businesses donated materials and labor for the project.
