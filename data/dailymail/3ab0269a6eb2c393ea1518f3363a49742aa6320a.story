Celebrity interior designer Kelly Hoppen has fallen out with  her  neighbours who claim she is causing 'chaos' while developing her new multi-million pound home in one of London's most exclusive areas.

Dragons' Den star Ms Hoppen,  given an MBE in 2009 for services to interior design, is spending a huge sum redeveloping a former auction house in west London into her dream new house.

The 55-year-old former step-mother of Sienna Miller is known as the Queen of Taupe because of her love of neutral colours and made her fortune from clients including the Beckhams and Hollywood stars.

But she is less popular with her new neighbours, who claim eight months of work on her new project has damaged their homes and left some  'unrentable'.

Owners who do not live there say that they are losing up to £40,000-a-year and want compensation from Ms Hoppen for loss of earnings.

The designer, who has also designed interiors for yachts, European châteaux and British Airways planes, has offered landlord Peter Knight, 57, around £4,500 but he believes it should be around £14,500.

He says he has given up trying to market his £1,000-a-week flat, worth around £1.6million, because of the noise.

He said: 'She is using her power and celebrity to pay us the lowest compensation possible but that is not how things should be done. 

'It has put an enormous amount of stress on my partner and made her unwell. It is her only source of income but nobody has wanted to live there because it is a building site. The noise has also been unbearable.

'Ms Hoppen's company has been using pneumatic drills to dig out the basement and it left large cracks in the walls of the flats.

'We have given up on viewings after eight months because people said they can't live with the noise. It is unrentable.

'All we are doing is trying to get Kelly Hoppen to pay a fair compensation for the chaos caused by her works.

'She has told us she wants to be a good neighbour but clearly she doesn't. I have tried over and over again to meet her but have been met with complete prevarication'.

Mr Knight believes that Ms Hoppen should pay £14,500 compensation but he broke off negotiations last month when he was offered in the region of £4,500.

Other neighbouring landlords are similarly upset about the way they have been treated by the interior designer.

Magdalena Gatzinska said at times dozens of people a week had viewed her flat last year but had refused to take it on. She believes she has lost around £40,000 in rental income.

She said: 'Kelly Hoppen has the right to develop a property, like anyone else, but I think the way this has been managed has been extremely unethical.

'There is noise from 8am and have no idea when the work will be completed. The shaking from digging the basement cracked the walls and shook things off the shelves.

'All she had to do is come to see us and tell us  what is happening. There has been nothing and we have no idea how long the work will go on for.

'My tenant has a child who is crying because of the noise. They can't be there during the day. The site is also unsafe.

'It is not about the money. This is about ethics but she and the builders just don't seem to care.' 

Ms Gatzinska claims last year a Hollywood actress rented her flat but then asked to leave because of the noise.

After months empty a new tenant has moved in at half the market rate but also looks set to leave, she says.

MailOnline understands Ms Hoppen has paid for the damage to walls in Mr Knight's flat and others but is yet to agree compensation over rental problems.

There is also a dispute over who should pay for waterproofing of her ceilings, as it is understood she believes it is the responsibility of the flatowners above her.

In 2012 she annoyed neighbours with noise from air conditioning units she fitted at her current £6million home in Notting Hill  without prior council approval.

One critic said that their 'peace and quiet' was at stake and eventually the dispute ended when Ms Hoppen agreed to turn the units off if they got too noisy.

The designer told MailOnline she is 'trying to be neighbourly' and said some residents 'seem to be very happy with the proposed improvement to the building'.

She said: 'London is an evolving city and has many developments that are going on all across the capital. Sadly these developments have a relatively short term negative effect on surrounding properties. For London to improve these developments need to happen and in the short-term this affects the local community negatively but in the long term improve London as a whole.

'The building contractors, I believe, have worked within all the guidelines set out by the local authority and I made sure the builders undertook the work over as short period of time as possible.

'I have already compensated our neighbours with thousands of pounds. I understand that it is inconvenient for our neighbours to experience these works and have tried to be as neighbourly as possible. I did however ask if the builders were permitted access to a number of our neighbours balcony to stop a water leak coming into our property. Sadly, one neighbour refused access asking for further compensation.

'I really do sympathise with the neighbours as there are several other developments going on within this building, the large development behind my space is noisy to this date'.

Ms Hoppen said the building's freeholder is carrying out work as well and says 'the majority of noise originates' from that works, a claim denied by neighbours.

She added that she has paid for works inside and outside the building and 'I have not asked our neighbours or the freeholder to contribute towards these costs'.

The interiors queen is in a relationship with businessman John Gardiner after twice being married and says he's 'the one'. Mr Gardiner is believed to help with her development projects.

She first married in 1982, but her marriage to restaurateur Graham Corrett ended seven years later. They have a daughter Natasha, a chef and food writer.

She later married Ed Miller, an American investment banker turned art dealer, ended in 2006 after he joined the cult in the United States. 

Mr Miller had two daughters, actress Sienna Miller and her fashion designer sister Savannah. They still call her 'mum'.

She has also been in relationships with former England defender Sol Campbell, DJ Jamie Theakston and hairdresser Nicky Clarke, but spit with him because of his infidelity.
