The Advertising Standards Authority has widened its inquiry into 'false' claims made by Apple about the capabilities of its new iPad - which is advertised as offering a network UK consumers cannot use.

The regulator said was investigating ‘potentially problematic’ claims on Apple’s website about the iPad’s 4G capabilities in the UK.

The UK does not yet have widespread 4G coverage, and the iPad will be incompatible with it when the first networks arrive. The feature is much-hyped by Apple as a selling point for the new tablet.

This 4G stands for ‘fourth
generation’, a new kind of signal technology used to receive
the internet on mobile phones.
Much of the UK already uses 3G, but demand for 'on the go' data means the networks are overloaded.

What will make 4G diffferent?

The industry says 4G will allow
mobile internet to run at the
same speed as domestic superfast
broadband. This will allow
users to watch videos more
easily on the go, and could
provide access to those whose
are out of reach of underground
broadband cables.

When will Britain get its first 4G network?

The firm Everything Everywhere
estimates it will be able to put
out the first 4G signal by the end
of this year. It yesterday
published a report saying that a
roll-out of 4G would need £5.5billion
from telecoms companies, but
could create up to 125,000 jobs.

Why won't it work with Apple's iPad?

The iPad’s current 4G configuration means it will 
not be able to connect to British and European networks because the 
frequencies are different to those used in the US and Canada.

Apple has already offered a refund to 
all Australian buyers of the new tablet - which has a similarly 
incompatible network -  in response to pressure from a consumer 
watchdog.

The ASA first investigated Apple for misleading’ 4G claims but closed the case informally when the company agreed to change its advertising.

It was now investigating new complaints from consumers that suggested the problematic claims were still appearing.

Apple has so far declined to comment.

However the BBC reported a source at the company saying that no undertaking was given to remove all references to 4G from its site.

Apple’s UK site still allows consumers to buy a ‘Wi-Fi + 4G’ version of the iPad - and iPads are still marked as offering 4G.

The ASA said in a statement: ‘To confirm, we received 40 complaints about claims for the iPad with Wi-Fi and 4G that appeared on Apple (UK) Ltd’s website.

'Complainants challenged whether the references to 4G were misleading, because they understood that 4G was not currently available in the UK.

'Some of the complainants also challenged the description of the iPad as 4G because they did not believe that the iPad would be compatible with 4G networks when they were introduced in the future.'

‘When we approached Apple with the concerns that had been raised, it stated it had removed references to 4G from the webpage that was subject to the complaints.

There is no national 4G network in Britain - and the planned networks will not even work with Apple's machine when they do appear

'Apple also agreed to edit a video that 
contained references to 4G. On the basis that the issues that had been 
raised with us had been resolved we closed the case informally.

‘We have since been contacted by several
complainants who have identified other potentially problematic claims 
about the iPad and 4G on Apple’s website.

'We are currently assessing 
these new complaints. If it appears that the problem claims we asked 
Apple to remove are still appearing, will investigate these new 
complaints.’

Apple also faced a dispute with Australian regulators over the advertising of the iPad there.

The country’s Competition and Consumer Commission accused the firm of misleading consumers by telling them that the product could connect to a 4G network in Australia when that was not the case.Apple offered to refund any iPad buyers in Australia who felt that they had been misled.

One model of the tablet claims that it is '4G' - but it will not work with Australian 4G networks.

There
is no national 4G network in Britain - and it's uncertain whether the 
planned networks will even work with Apple's machine when they do 
appear.

The new tablet is labelled as '4G' - but the connection won't work in many countries including the UK

'All UK
ads should avoid containing anything that is likely to mislead,' says an ASA
spokesperson. 'The Advertising Code states that ads must not mislead 
the consumer by omitting material information or by presenting it in an 
unclear, unintelligible or ambiguous way.

Apple will email all Australian buyers of its new iPad to offer them a refund, a lawyer for the company said today.

The move came after the nation's consumer watchdog accused it of misleading advertising over one key aspect of the product.

The 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken legal action to
ensure Apple makes consumers aware its third-generation iPad cannot 
connect to a 4G mobile data network in Australia due to technical 
incompatibility.
