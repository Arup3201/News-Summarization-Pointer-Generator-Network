Police are asking the public to return any cash flung by a serial bank and sporting goods robber during his attempted getaway in a silver Volvo and red Flash superhero T-Shirt this week.

Ending what would be a four-robbery attack using gasoline and a shotgun within minutes of one another, David Anderson, 26, was arrested in Colorado Springs, Colorado while freely distributing his acquired loot.

Police say first launching the crime spree just after 1pm on Wednesday, Anderson walked into a Big Five Sporting Goods store on West Uintah Street with a shotgun while trying to obtain a second.

Crime spree: After entering a sporting goods store just after 1pm with a shotgun, Anderson escaped a scuffle with an employee while firing off a shot before robbing his first bank

He allegedly fired the gun in the store and struggled with an employee who tried to disarm him.

Witnesses reported Anderson fleeing the store while threatening to commit suicide, only to be reported 20 minutes later at the Adams Bank on East Cheyenne Mountain Blvd.

After making off with an unspecified amount of cash from the bank, less than five minutes later he was reported at the UMB Bank on the same boulevard, but was thwarted by a security guard and employees who wouldn't let him inside.

In his frustration, the 26-year-old allegedly poured gasoline around the outside of the building attempting to set it on fire.

Police say it failed to ignite.

In his last attack, he allegedly robbed a Chase Bank on North Tejon Street before making his final getaway during which police received calls of the same silver Jetta throwing cash out of its window.

‘At least one person was bending over and picking up what appeared to be some money,’ one witness told CBS Denver. ‘I figured it was something that wasn’t so good so I just kept driving.’

It was in the lobby of the downtown Antlers Hotel that police caught up with Anderson who was continuing his cash handouts to hotel employees.

Anderson was led away to an awaiting police car, without failing to grin, roll his eyes and stick his tongue out from the backseat at responding media.

Making his first court appearance on Thursday, the seriousness of his charges didn't appear to have made much more of an impression, with Anderson maintaining his jovial demeanour before the judge.

While potentially threatening him with an additional charge of being in contempt of court, Anderson used the judge's presented opportunity of asking questions to question him on the day of the week and their location.

'It's September 20th, you're sure about that?' he asked after his answer from the judge, according to KRDO.

'I'm positive,' the judge replied.

'Where are you located right now?'

'I'm at the courthouse.'

Through with his antics after Anderson next started chiming in about ‘a fancy piece of machinery’ spotted beside the judge, he was ordered to take a seat before a deputy pulled him away.

Appearance: In his first court appearance on Thursday, one day after his arrest, Anderson appeared jovial as he did his best to squeeze out as many odd questions as he could to the judge

Completion: The 26-year-old is seen laughing as an officer pulls him to be seated to end his antics

As a sign of the seriousness of his 
crimes perhaps catching up with him when the cameras are off, however, 
Anderson wore a cloth suicide-prevention vest.

He's been charged with two counts of aggravated robbery and two counts of attempted robbery while held on $500,000 bond.

His next court date is scheduled for September 26.
