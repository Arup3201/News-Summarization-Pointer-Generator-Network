Norwich does not seem to have a surplus of plush hotels - but it does have 38 St Giles. This is a charming, dignified B&B in a perfect spot for much of what Norwich has to offer.

Grade 2-listed, the house was originally built for the Gurney banking family in 1770, which later merged with Barclays. It doesn’t look like much from the outside, but once you walk through the red front door - reached via a passageway that leads to a nursery school - you’ll feel pleasingly disarmed.

William Cheeseman greets us in a low-key sort of way and shows us up the wonderful staircase.

Quietly appealing: 38 St Giles St is not especially flashy, but guests will certainly feel at home

We are meant to be heading for the top floor, but never make it.

‘I thought we’d pop you in here instead,’ says William.

What he means is that he’s giving us the suite, which is really a small apartment, with wood floors, painted panelled walls, huge low-lying bed and a piece of chocolate cake waiting by the kettle.

Everything about the room is generous - the towels, the high ceilings, the fragrant lilies, the kilim rugs, the bottles of complimentary water. There’s no shower, unfortunately, and the shiny curtains are a touch Nineties. We also don’t understand the need for a modern chandelier in a room of this pedigree.

We ask William if he can recommend a Chinese restaurant.

Not only does he suggest a place called Fusion, but puts a word in for the aubergine with shredded pork - and then produces a map so we can find the restaurant. Off we set, past Norwich’s famous market and through the pedestrian precinct.

We find the restaurant. No one seems to be around, and only one other table is occupied - but the friendly staff make up for any lack of atmosphere.

The next day, we will visit Norwich Cathedral, surely one of the greatest religious buildings in the world, where choral services are still held twice a day.

But first, a good sleep and a fine breakfast. 

Our suite faces the road - but it’s gloriously quiet on a Sunday evening and we sleep like purring pilgrims. Breakfast is served in a room off the hall.

William is ready in his pinny. He has squeezed some Spanish oranges and poured the juice into a little jug. My soft-boiled eggs are perfect, and we like the individual pots of butter.

We are less keen on the black cups and saucers and the radio, albeit tuned to Radio 3. It seems we are the only guests. Someone needs to spread the word.
