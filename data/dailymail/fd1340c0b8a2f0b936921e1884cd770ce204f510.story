More than two years after Google launched its Glass Explorer scheme in the U.S, it has finally made it available to gadget fans in the UK.

From today, any British resident aged over 18 can buy a Glass prototype from the official website for £1,000 -  as long as they have a valid credit card.

The wearable headset has also launched with partner apps including Zombies Run, Goal.com and Shazam.

More than two years after Google launched its Glass Explorer scheme in the U.S, it has finally made it available to gadget fans in the UK. From today, any UK resident aged over 18 can buy a Glass prototype (pictured) from the official website for £1,000 -  as long as they have a valid credit card

Google Glass was developed by Google X - the facility within Google 
devoted to technological advancements, such as driverless cars.

It was initially designed in 2011 to resemble standard eyeglasses, but with the lens 
replaced by a heads-up display (HUD).

Google 
later engineered a prototype that weighed 8lb (3.6kg), and the current version is now 
lighter than the average pair of sunglasses at 1.6oz (50g).

In April 2013, the Explorer Edition was made available to Google I/O developers in the U.S for $1,500.

The
 product began testing in April 2012 and a month later Google demonstrated for the first 
time how Google Glass could be used to shoot video.

A touchpad on the side of the Glass lets users control it by swiping through a timeline-like interface display on the screen.

For instance, sliding backward shows current events, such the football score, and sliding forward shows past events, such as messages and photos.

Its camera takes photos and records at 720p HD video.

The Explorer programme aims to 'let people from all walks of life play an active role in shaping Glass ahead of a wider consumer launch'.

Ivy Ross, Head of Glass said: ‘Technology is at its best when it fits seamlessly into our lives and lets us get on with whatever we’re doing.

'Our goal for Glass is exactly that - to make it easier to bring people the technology they rely on without drawing them out of the moment.’

Glass is still a prototype and will continue to be developed before it is made available to more consumers.

Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device.

The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much.

'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said.

'Since the programme started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about.

'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!'

Upon the release of the second-generation Glass in December, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer programme - about 6,000 people - were able to 'invite' three of their friends to join the scheme.

Google are rumored to be working on facial recognition, a zoom-in camera and live internet streaming for a new edition.

Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system, which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames.

It is unclear whether the prescription offers available in the U.S will be launched in the UK.

The idea of a computer and recording device on one's head has made some non-Glass users uncomfortable, and it has pushed the conversation about etiquette and social norms in a connected world.

Establishments including bars and cinemas have kicked out Explorers, who critics call 'Glassholes'.

In February, Google released an etiquette guide explaining how users can avoid being labeled a 'Glasshole' when strutting around with the headwear.

Several major companies have already been testing Glass, with airline Virgin Atlantic using the device with their upper class passengers; deploying the device to manage flight details and organise transfers.

While the launch of the device in the UK is likely to excite those within the industry, Stuart Miles - the founder of technology website Pocket-lint - believes the average consumer still requires some convincing that Glass is the future of tech.

'It’s good news for UK customers keen to play with the Glass without having to jump through the numerous hoops to import it from America. Whether it will be enough to convince Brits to embrace the wearable tech, however, is yet to be seen,' he said.

As part of the process of making Glass more appealing to consumers, new frames by fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg have now also been made available.

For those who are interested in trying out Glass, Google has set up a Basecamp in London - running on the 27 and 28 June - where customers can go to be fitted and ask questions about Glass before buying it.
