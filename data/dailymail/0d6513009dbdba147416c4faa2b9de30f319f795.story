Deep space can be a lonely place. But what if astronauts could beam their favourite HD videos from Earth? Or create their own 3D films for us to see?

That's exactly what Nasa hopes to achieve by testing a system that could replace primitive radio transmissions, which are currently used in space, with laser-based communication.

The agency claims the technology will make it possible to eventually send huge amounts of data to deep space.

However, its first step will be to establish a two-way laser communication with the moon to prove that the technology is possible.

Nasa is planning to ditch primitive radio transmissions and start communicating with lasers in space. The experiment is part of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) mission which will be hosted aboard LADEE satellite (pictured)

The experiment is part of the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) mission which is scheduled to launch on Friday.

As well as HD video it could, for instance, also allow humans to remotely control machines for tasks such as asteroid mining or building structures on the moon.

LLCD is Nasa’s first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. 

‘The goal of the LLCD experiment is to validate and build confidence in this technology so that future missions will consider using it,’ said Don Cornwell, LLCD manager.

‘We can even envision such a laser-based system enabling a robotic mission to an asteroid,’ he added.

‘It could have 3D, high-definition video signals transmitted to Earth providing essentially “telepresence” to a human controller on the ground.’

Since Nasa first ventured into space, radio frequency (RF) communication has been the communications platform used. But it is now reaching its limit as demand for more data capacity increases.

According to Nasa, laser communication would be less likely to suffer from interference, another limitation of radio frequency (RF) signals.

‘LLCD is designed to send six times more data from the moon using a smaller transmitter with 25 per cent less power as compared to the equivalent state-of-the-art radio (RF) system,’ said Cornwell.

‘Lasers are also more secure and less susceptible to interference and jamming.’

The LLCD experiment is hosted aboard Nasa’s LADEE: a 100-day robotic mission designed, built, integrated, tested and will be operated by Ames.

The LADEE spacecraft will take 30 days to reach the moon because of its flight path.

LLCD will begin operations shortly after arrival into lunar orbit and continue for 30 days afterward.

LLCD’s main mission objective is to transmit hundreds of millions of bits of data per second from the moon to Earth.

This is equivalent to transmitting more than 100 HD television channels simultaneously.

LLCD receiving capability will also be tested as tens of millions of bits per second are sent from Earth to the spacecraft.

There is a primary ground terminal at Nasa’s White Sands Complex in New Mexico, to receive and transmit LLCD signals.

An MIT team designed, built, and tested the terminal. They also will be responsible for LLCD’s operation at that site.

There are two alternate sites, one located at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, which is for receiving only.

The other is being provided by the European Space Agency on the Spanish island of Tenerife, off the coast of Africa.

It will have two-way communication capability with LLCD.

'Having several sites gives us alternatives which greatly reduces the possibility of interference from clouds,' said Cornwell. 

Nasa engineers believe this technology is even more exciting for communications beyond Earth’s orbit.

In the past, Nasa has experimented with sending low amounts of individual pulses to cameras on far-away space probes near Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury.

Recently, an image of Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, the Mona Lisa, was transmitted to Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft orbiting the moon.

‘But this was done at only hundreds of data bits per second,’ said Cornwell.

‘LLCD will be the first dedicated optical communication system and will send data millions of times faster.’
