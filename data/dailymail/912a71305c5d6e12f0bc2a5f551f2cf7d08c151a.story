Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has shrugged off the limitations of a £49million transfer cap by revealing that the new Premier League champions are well on the way to landing their summer transfer targets.

City want to sign defender Bacary Sagna on a free transfer from Arsenal and retain a strong interest in £35m-rated FC Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala and his teammate Fernando despite an UEFA punishment for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations.

As well as having their net spending capped, City's wage bill has also been frozen although £200,000-a-week will be freed up after Khaldoon confirmed that Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott are not being offered new contracts.

In demand: Porto's Eliaquim Mangala is rated at £35m but still a primary focus for the Premier League Champions

Under pressure: City financial constraints haven't dampened their interest in Fernando, also from Porto

After stealing a march on their rivals
 by spending nearly £100m on Fernandinho, Jesus Navas, Alvaro Negredo 
and Stevan Jovetic last summer, the City chief promised that they will 
not waste any time again now.

He said: 'Expect the same - but even earlier.

'Today
 I can tell you we know exactly what needs to be done, we know exactly 
the players that need to go and the players that need to come to the 
areas that need to be strengthened.

'So
 I can tell our fans: expect an efficient and swift execution plan and 
we will have, after the World Cup, a good pre-season and will go into 
the season very ready as we did last year ready to compete in four all 
four competitions.'

City's actions last summer, including the
 sacking of Roberto Mancini as manager, put the club back on an upward 
trajectory after a relatively disappointing end to the 2012-13 season.

Al Mubarak reported that owner Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi has been delighted with progress in the past 12 months.

He said: 'Sheikh Mansour feels this club 
is doing exactly what he intended it to do in terms of performance 
across the board - on the field, off field, trophies, championships and 
wins, but also commercial success, and the fans' support has been 
unwavering.

'Genuinely, Sheikh Mansour is absolutely delighted with the way this club, this company, this business is performing.'

City did attract criticism after parting company with Mancini, as the Italian had led the club to their first title in 44 years in 2012.

But Manuel Pellegrini has proved a popular, reliable and successful replacement and the club feel their decision has been vindicated.

Al Mubarak said: 'The decision to hire Pellegrini was a very important decision for us as we look at the next couple of years.

'I am absolutely delighted for him, for the fans, for the club, for everyone involved at Manchester City.

'It is a perfectly justified decision. I think the results speak for themselves.'

One of the next targets for City will be to carry their domestic pre-eminence onto the European stage.

Some progress on this front has been made under Pellegrini, with the club reaching the Champions League knockout stage for the first time.

Al Mubarak said: 'This year we have made some progress. We have played much better football, been a lot more competitive and I think the experience coming through the two games against Barcelona will be invaluable for us.

'Let's be clear - Europe has always been an integral part of our strategy, an integral part of the success we want to achieve for this club. We will continue to progress.'

Al Mubarak also paid tribute to two City players who are now out of contract in Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry and are set to leave this summer.

Defender Lescott, signed from Everton in an acrimonious £22million deal in 2009, played a key role in the 2012 title win.

Tribute: As with Lescott, Al Mubarak thanked Gareth Barry for his services to City after a year's loan at Everton

Al Mubarak said: 'He is a wonderful man. He has served this club loyally and he has had some of his best performances in his career here at Manchester City.

'I look back at the challenge when we first brought Joleon in and the reaction he had at Everton. It was a tough time for him but I am really happy for him. He came here and had a wonderful career.

'We will miss him and I really want to thank him for all his efforts.'

Barry, who also joined the club in 2009, enjoyed four good seasons in the City midfield before joining Everton on loan last summer.

Al Mubarak said: 'Gareth is another one of those wonderful players that made a big career decision when he decided to join City.

'He was a loyal player in our squad, fully committed to our cause, had some phenomenal performances.

'He really was a great player for Manchester City. I really want to wish him all the best going forward.'
