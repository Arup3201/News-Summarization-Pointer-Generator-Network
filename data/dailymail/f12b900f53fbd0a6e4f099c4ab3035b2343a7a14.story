Poor credit: Former banker Giles Darby is pictured outside the Federal Court in Houston in 2006

It is a far cry from his days as a high-flying City banker, responsible for millions of pounds of business.

But after serving time for fraud as one of the infamous ‘NatWest Three’, Giles Darby has begun a new life running a real-ale pub – and it’s strictly cash-only.

The 50-year-old was banned from incurring new lines of credit as part of his terms of release, but that’s not the reason he can’t take credit or debit cards behind the bar at the Marlborough Arms in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

‘The reason we can only take cash is because of this pub’s credit history,’ Darby said. ‘That makes it incredibly difficult to lease a chip-and-pin machine.’

And perhaps ironically for a man who admitted his role in defrauding NatWest, he blames the banks for that predicament.

‘Lloyds would allow me [a card machine] but they would charge me an extortionate amount,’ he said.

‘We’re a new business – we just can’t afford the bank fees. Maybe that’s karma.’

Darby has made no secret of his conviction in the US courts – even posing the question ‘How long did I spend in jail?’ in a pub quiz soon after taking over.

But he remains unapologetic about the case. 

‘We were stitched up,’ he said. ‘You don’t go up against the US machine and come out a winner.  But I’ve done my time and things have worked out surprisingly well.’

Darby and his co-defendants David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew hit the headlines in 2006 when they were controversially extradited to the US.

In a plea bargain they admitted playing a part in a £3.5million fraud against their employer, NatWest and were sentenced to 37 months in jail.

They were allowed to complete their sentence in the UK, and were released three years ago.
