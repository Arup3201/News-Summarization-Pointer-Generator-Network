A Banksy mural that was originally on the wall of a Hollywood gas station sold this week for more than $200,000 at auction.

An anonymous bidder scooped up the massive slab of street art from Julien’s Auctions, in Beverly Hills, with a winning bid of $209,000 in the first-ever US auction of a Banksy piece.

The mural is on a nine-by-eight-foot slab of beige brick wall and weighs almost four tons, according to Reuters.

On the move: Banksy painted 'Flower Girl' on the side of a Los Angeles gas station in 2008 - it sold Thursday at auction

The piece was completed in 2008 using Banksy’s trademark stencil-style, according to an auction house statement.

It shows a young girl wearing a dress and carrying a basket of flowers while looking up at a camera sitting at the top of a taller-than-life flower stem – it is named ‘Flower Girl.’

‘In ‘Flower Girl,’ the artist poignantly juxtaposes the innocence of a young girl picking flowers with the curious and questioning gaze of someone not yet willing to back down,’ said the statement. 

As it originally appeared: 'Flower Girl' before it was removed from a Hollywood Chevron station

Where it all began: This gas station, now a Chevron, is where the Banksy mural was resided before being removed

Workers removed it from a Hollywood Chevron station so it could be sold at Thursday’s auction.

Four other Banksy pieces were sold Thursday for a total of $248,000, Reuters noted. Among them was ‘TV Girl,’ which sold for $137,000.

‘Flower Girl’ was sold as part of an auction featuring only street art, and was among a collection of 92 total pieces put up for sale.

The pieces pulled in a small fortune, but they were not the highest-selling Banksy works of all-time.

That distinction goes to a piece known as ‘Slave Labour,’ according to Reuters.

‘Slave Labour,’ which shows a young child making Union Jack patches on an industrial sewing machine, sold for $1.1million at a recent London auction.

More Banksy pieces will sell later this month in Miami, Reuters noted.
