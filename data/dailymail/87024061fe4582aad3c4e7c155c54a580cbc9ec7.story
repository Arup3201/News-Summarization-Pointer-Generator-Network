Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has praised Harry Kane for emerging from a difficult loan spell with Leicester to lead the line for Tottenham, but believes it is too soon for an England call-up just yet.

Kane spent four months at the King Power Stadium in 2013, but only played in three wins and mostly featured from the bench, scoring twice in 15 games.

Leicester suffered a late-season slump and only squeezed into the Championship playoffs with a last-minute winner on the final day before losing out to Watford in the semi-finals in dramatic circumstances.

Pearson is impressed with how Kane, 21, has responded in his career — with 13 goals in 22 games for Spurs this season.

‘Harry came in at a difficult time for us and I think for him,’ said the Leicester manager. ‘We were in a terrible run then just as we are now. So it wasn’t always easy for him, but he handled himself exceptionally well.

‘Of course, he’s a couple of years older now, with more experience — and as a very likeable and level-headed young man, as he was then, he’s proved to be an outstanding talent.

‘People are even talking about the possibility of an international call-up. But again, let’s keep things in perspective. He’s doing very well for himself and for his club at the moment.

‘I’d like to think he’d look back on his time here as valuable, whether in terms of the appearances he made or of being able to deal with setbacks in football.

‘In hindsight you learn as much from the difficult times as you do from the positive. Harry was very popular and the staff rated him highly.’

Meanwhile, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has warned Emmanuel Adebayor that it will take more than a crowded festive fixture list to grant a return to the team.

Adebayor scored 14 last season but has only struck twice since Pochettino replaced Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane in the summer and has not started a game for almost two months.

‘I will decide to pick him when he’s ready,’ said the Spurs boss. ‘When he deserves to play, he plays.’

Pochettino has made it clear reputations count for nothing under his leadership. Paulinho and Aaron Lennon are others who have been on the fringes while academy graduates Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason have thrived.

Kane seized his chance while Adebayor struggled with injuries and returned to Africa for personal reasons.

‘Football pays when you work hard,’ said Pochettino, on the subject of 21-year-old Kane. ‘We need to take advantage of the player’s moment.’

Adebayor, 30, was not included in the squad who beat Burnley on Saturday.

Asked if he would need to bring the Togo striker back for the Christmas programme, with three games in seven days, starting at Leicester, Pochettino shrugged and said: ‘Maybe, maybe.’
