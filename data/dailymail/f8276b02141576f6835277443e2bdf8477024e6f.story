The 'Mr Yummy' ice cream man filmed smashing the van window of his Mr Whippy rival has been spared a jail term.

Zeheer Ramzan, 34, was given a six month prison sentence, suspended for two years, at Preston Crown Court yesterday.

He was found guilty of assaulting father-of-three Mohammed Mulla in Palatine Road, Blackburn, Lancashire, in an apparent turf war.

The judge also ordered Ramzan to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, pay £100 compensation and £800 costs and made him the subject of a two-year restraining order.

The argument in June last year, in which Ramzan was armed with a crowbar, was caught on video by horrified neighbours and led to one million hits on YouTube.

The court heard in November that Mohammed Mulla, 41, had operated his Mr Whippy van for 12 years in the Lancashire town.

In March last year, Ramzan, who lives 30 miles away in Halifax and was selling ices on a commission basis, arrived at a school where Mr Mulla operated.

Mr Mulla told him: 'You can’t come and trade here.' He also complained to Ramzan's employers that he was driving dangerously.

After the two men had vied for customers, it escalated into Ramzan assaulting his rival - but he has been spared jail

Ramzan was not deterred, however, and the two men vied for customers.

Locals said one would offer four two-scoop cones with a chocolate flake for £2, after which the other would offer the same deal for 10p cheaper.

Matters came to a head on June 2 when Mr Mulla pulled into a street to find the Mr Yummy van already parked in front of him.

He was seen breaking a window in the Mr Whippy van of Mr Mulla, who then hit the back of Ramzan’s Mr Yummy van as he tried to get away.

Ramzan, of Halifax, had previously pleaded guilty to criminal damage and possession of a weapon in a public place. After a trial in November he was found guilty of assault with intent.

Speaking after the verdict, Mr Mulla said: 'It’s a relief to see justice done. It has been a nightmare since this happened.

'The incident was terrifying and I was frightened to go out afterwards. I am very relieved.'

In November the former Mr Yummy driver had previously pleaded guilty at Blackburn magistrates’ court to criminal damage and possession of a weapon in a public place, but denied assault.  

But magistrates said his account of events was 'untruthful'.

The 34-year-old Halifax man had told Blackburn police his victim Mr Mulla, had purposefully driven into the back of his van.

But magistrates accepted Mr Mulla’s version of events, that he had been struck on the arm with the wrench, and then showered with glass from a smashed window.

Police recalled Ramzan for questioning after viewing the YouTube footage. He answered, 'no comment' to a series of follow-up questions and claimed the glass smashed accidentally.

Prosector Eddie Harrison asked if he had left his vehicle armed with the tyre wrench both times he approached Mr Mulla.

Ramzan replied 'No'. He said: 'I just ran at his van to scare him away, he had been following me. I went back to the van for it because he had waved a claw hammer at me.'

Mr Harrison then showed CCTV footage from Mr Mulla’s van in which he can be seen holding the wrench both times he approaches. Mr Ramzan replied 'It was months ago.'

Mr Ramzan had also told the court he had never been in trouble with the police before to which Mr Harrison produced documents showing court convictions for driving when uninsured and obstructing justice.

Defending, Tahir Mahmood said there was no evidence from the CCTV that the tyre wrench caused later bruising to Mr Mulla's arm. He said: 'There is not even sound on the audio track of the CCTV to suggest that.'

Mr Harrison said: 'You told a pack of lies to the police to blacken the name of a rival seller.

'Without the video evidence, Mr Mulla may have been the defendant.'
