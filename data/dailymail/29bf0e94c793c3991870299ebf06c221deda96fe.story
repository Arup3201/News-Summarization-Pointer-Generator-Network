Banned: Wright-Phillips claims he did not know about the driving ban as he doesn't open his post - his agent does

Millionaire footballer Shaun Wright-Phillips avoided jail yesterday for driving while banned because he was 'blissfully unaware' his licence had been revoked.

The former England star told ­Uxbridge Magistrates' Court he was unaware he should not have been on the road, and claimed he had not seen the legal papers banning him from driving because they had been sent to his agent's address.

The winger, who plays for QPR, had missed a string of court summons after his £200,000 Bentley was clocked doing 79mph on a 50mph stretch at Esher in Surrey, on March 28 last year.

The 31-year-old's luxury car was registered at his agent's address in Luton, Bedfordshire, which is where the important document informing him about his disqualification, was sent.

Several reminders were issued, including one to the former Manchester City and Chelsea star's home in Surrey, but Wright-Phillips claimed in court yesterday he had not seen any of them.

He was finally banned from driving in his absence in December.

Then, on January 21 this year, Met Police officers arrested Wright-Phillips at QPR's training ground in Harlington, West London, after spotting his insurance had been invalidated during a routine check.

He was charged with driving while banned and driving without insurance. At his trial yesterday, he admitted to both offences.

Defending Wright-Phillips, his lawyer
Gwyn Lewis argued he should escape a further ban or jail as he was 
­'blissfully unaware' of the papers.

Mr
Lewis, dubbed Merlin the Magician for his ability to make 'many 
worrying cases disappear', said: 'We will be making a special reasons 
argument that the defendant shouldn’t be endorsed with points, a ban or 
jail, which would normally be the case.'

Magistrates accepted his case and fined the player £800 and ordered him to pay £85 costs with an £80 surcharge for the first charge of driving while banned.

The bench accepted he 'would not have expected to receive the mail'.

Wright-Phillips, who was banned for speeding in 2004 by Crewe magistrates, told the court: 'From now on I will definitely open the mail even if it is junk.'

He left court without commenting.
