Creative cat owners can now build their pet a castle, a tower or even a robot to play in thanks to a new product.

'Blocks' is a package of shapes made from recycled cardboard which can be folded into any shape you want.

The cardboard pieces - cubes, beams, tunnels, bridges and slides - slot together to create a sturdy and simulating playhouse for felines.

Playground for cats: 'Blocks' is a package of shapes made from recycled cardboard

Feline fun: Like Lego, the blocks can be used to create any shape you want

I'm the king of the castle: The product can stimulate cats mentally and keep them active

The product is the brainchild of Poopy Cat, a Dutch company which launched its biodegradable and disposable litter box just over a year ago.

That led to the idea of creating a playhouse built from component parts like Lego bricks, which the company have developed for five months.

They say the product will not only keep cats mentally stimulated but will also fight obesity by getting their moving around it. 

Versatile: When the user or their cat get bored they can just unlock the blocks and create a new design

Pur-fect ideas: The product is the brainchild of Poopy Cat, a Dutch company which previously launched a biodegradable and disposable litter box

Rest and play: This design creates a bridge for your cat to walk across or they can cuddle into a cube

Flatpacked: Cardboard pieces create cubes, beams, tunnels, bridges and slides that can all slot together

When the user or their cat get bored they can just unlock the blocks and create a new design. 

Poopy Cat say they have tested it with various cat breeds to ensure it stays strong. 

After the product design stage, the company chose crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to finance its first batch and has raised almost double its target.

Those who pledged at least €30 (£23) will be the first to receive the product.    

Thomas Vles, from Poopy Cat, said: 'We work a lot with cardboard with our previous product and if you have an empty Poopy Cat litter tray cats immediately want to play with it so the idea was there for making some kind of playhouse.

'The market for playhouses and scratching posts is huge so we wanted to do something different.

'This is a bit like building your house out of Lego. Cats like playing a lot. Not only is this good fun, it is also imperative for their development.

Step one: The cube looks like this before it is assembled

Step two: The sides have been designed to all slot together

Step three: The cube takes shape and holes can be pushed out so your cat can jump inside

Portable: When flatpacked, the product can be taken with you on holiday or to the office if your cat is joining you on your travels

'Blocks stimulates mental and physical exercise in a natural way for cats of all ages. Especially for indoor cats, this helps prevent boredom and obesity and prevents them destroying objects like the sofa.

'We chose cardboard because it is strong, durable and sustainable. It may seem like a temporary or disposable material but that is not the case.

'In our office we have a Blocks castle which has been used intensively for three months by us, our office cats and guests and the castle is still standing strong.'
