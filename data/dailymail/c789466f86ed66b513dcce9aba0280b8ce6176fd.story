A cyclist has suffered a broken cheekbone and concussion after a surprise attack by a goose.

Kerry Surman was riding alone near her home in Stittsville, Ottawa on June 10 when she saw the gaggle of geese and goslings crossing ahead of her along the Trans Canada Trail.

Speaking to CBC, she said that she thought she would be able to ride past them as they left the path - but she was wrong.

When geese attack: Kerry Surman was left with a fractured cheekbone, concussion, loose teeth and a scar beneath her eyebrow after she was attacked by a Canada Goose while on a cycling trail

'I misjudged how fast I was going and the goose misjudged my intentions,' she told the channel.

As she neared the group, she saw the last goose turn and look at her.

'What
 I remember is the goose giving me the evil eye and then the goose 
wrapping its wings around my head, and I can't see and I hear myself 
screaming.'

She was thrown from her bike and, even though she was wearing a helmet, she was knocked unconscious and landed in poison ivy on the trail, CTV reported.

Terror: Surman, pictured on the Ottawa trail where she was attacked, said she saw the geese and thought she could get past them without a problem - but one turned on her and attacked her face

Terror: She said the large bird wrapped its wings around her face before she fell to the ground

Threat: She said she often sees the geese on the trail and thinks they were just protecting their young

When she 
came to, she remembers struggling to drag herself to a nearby road where
 she was able to flag down a passerby who called 911 and waited with her
 for an ambulance to arrive.

Surman spent five days in hospital after 
suffering a concussion, fractured cheekbone, face lacerations and loose teeth, CBC reported.

An image taken 48 hours after the attack in hospital shows her scratched face, black eye and scars beneath her eyebrow.

Her helmet and sunglasses probably prevented further damage, she believes.

Surman, who has been left with a scar beneath her eyebrow, said she is not physically ready to return to her bike, but she will be more careful when she does.

Wary: Surman's husband Todd Edwardson, pictured together, said that they have often seen geese along the trail but now no to exercise much more caution

Canada geese are extremely adaptable so are often found in urban areas. They are particularly attracted to mowed lawns, golf courses, parks, and similar areas next to open water, which means conflicts can arise.

They are aggressive 
defenders of their nests and young so you should do not approach them. They 
may charge and can inflict injuries.

If you see a goose's neck go vertical and straight, it is wary of some danger, and if you see it begin to rapidly lower and raise its head in a pumping motion, they are about to attack.

In this situation, do not look away from the goose and back away slowly, Ohio Geese Control suggests. If one flies at you, duck while still facing the bird.

You can prevent confrontations by never feeding geese, placing flags outside your home, using low-power lasers or fencing off their territories, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

'You have to know they are going to attack if they feel threatened,' she said.

When she was in the hospital, she learned that attacks by Canada Geese are not uncommon.

Michel Gosselin, Manager of the Bird Collection at the Canadian Museum of Nature, told CTV that attacks almost always involve an adult trying to protect its young.

'Normally they just fly away, but when they have a nest or young they cannot leave them behind so they have to defend them,' he said.

may charge, and can inflict injuries.

Surman warned that, if you see them, you should keep your distance.

Her husband, Todd Edwardson, said they had seen the geese along the trail previously.

'We went by them. I guess we didn't startle them,' he said. 'So you just don't know, so always best to exercise some caution.'
