Graphic surveillance video released today shows a middle-aged woman being horrifically beaten and robbed in a Brooklyn subway stop earlier this month.

Video obtained by the NYPD shows 56-year-old Dina Perez being brutally attacked at the 18th Avenue Station in Borough Park in Brooklyn around 2:40am on March 9 by an assailant wearing a black hoodie with Greek letters on it.

In the footage, the attacker can be seen pushing the woman repeatedly against the wall of the subway station in a mad effort to grab her purse. A 21-year-old former St Francis student, Aidan Folan, has been arrested for the attack.

Mugging: A 56-year-old woman was mugged earlier this month at a subway station in Borough Park, Brooklyn

Assault: Dina Perez, 56, was grabbed by her coat and slammed by her assailant against the wall again and again

Alleged perp: Aidan Folan, left, was arrested Wednesday afternoon by NYPD officers for the alleged attack

The video begins showing the woman slowly walking down the right side of the stairwell, with the man in a hoodie quickly following her down on the opposite side.

Wounds: Dina Perez suffered significant bruising, a bloody lip, and a black eye from the attack, as well as a broken wrist

The assailant proceeds to grab Ms Perez by her coat, repeatedly throwing her against a wall of the subway station.

Speaking with WABC, Ms Perez recounted her terror as the man silently attacked her. ‘Not talk to me, nothing. Only pulls me, that’s it,’ she said.

At one point during the minute-long attack, the assailant throws her to the concrete floor of the subway station and apparently began kicking her as she tried to get up.

The man then dumps the contents of her black purse on the ground and chased after her as she tried to run away.

Sources told the New York Post that it was easy to track down the alleged mugger because of the large purple letters of his Alpha Phi Delta hoodie and his nickname, ‘Stugotz,’ in plain view on the back of it.

Folan is seen in numerous Facebook pictures wearing a similar hooded sweatshirt with the Greek letters sewn on front. The Post reports that he attended St Francis College for a year before dropping out.

According to WABC, the robber only took a small envelope with money in it, leaving behind her wallet, purse, and jewellery.

Fraternal: Folan was a member of the Alpha Phi Delta fraternity while attending St Francis College and is seen in countless photos posing in his letters

She was taken to Maimonides Medical Center and was treated for a broken arm and various facial bruises, police told DNAInfo.com.

Now, Ms Perez said that she has to sleep sitting up because of the pain and is afraid to leave her own apartment.

The fraternity was founded at Syracuse University in 1914 by men with Italian roots, according to the organization’s website.

The word ‘Stugotz’ and the number 27 were sewn on the back.

The
neighborhood is home to the largest Hasidic Jewish community outside of
Israel and has a relatively low crime rate, with only two robberies 
reported within the last month.

Blow by blow: The thug mercilessly kicked the woman as she struggled to get up

Violent: The suspect, identified as a white or Hispanic male in his 20s, only stole an envelope with cash
