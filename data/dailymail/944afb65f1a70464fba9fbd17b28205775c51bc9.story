An 18-year-old Georgia man has drowned while playing a game in which someone is launched off a dock in a shopping cart and has to swim to safety.

Chance Werner, of Euharlee, graduated high school just hours before the tragic incident at Lake Allatoona Saturday night, authorities said.

Werner was playing the game with other teens and an adult at Dock D at the Holiday Harbor Marina in Bartow County just before midnight.

The friends were pushing each other into the lake in the shopping cart, and pulling the cart back up with a rope, according to Bartow County Sheriff Clark Millsap.

Victim: Chance Werner, of Euharlee, graduated high school just hours before the tragic incident at Lake Allatoona Saturday night, authorities said

Most of the time, the cart is tied to a pole at the dock, but in this instance, Werner decided to act as the pole.

She said the rope was tied to the cart and his belt loop and when the cart was launched off the dock it dragged Werner down with it.

The teen was pulled about 30 feet below the surface and he drowned.

'This is a tragedy for this young man just as he was starting the next stage in his life,' Melissa Cummings, spokeswoman for Georgia Department of Natural Resources, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Police were called to the dock at 12:07 a.m. Sunday and his body was recovered almost three hours later.

He was still tied to the cart.

'We donâ€™t want people playing games with water like this,' Cummings said.

'It's an accident waiting to happen - kids playing with ropes and heavy objects.'
