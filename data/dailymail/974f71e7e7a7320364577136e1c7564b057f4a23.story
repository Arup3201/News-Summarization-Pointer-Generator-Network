Jack Nicklaus has set the scene for another Rory McIlroy spectacular at the US PGA Championship this week with the extraordinary prediction that he could win ‘15 or 20 majors’.

The greatest golfer of all time shrugged off his usual conservative approach to lavish praise on the Northern Irishman to whom he has become something of a mentor.

‘I think Rory is an unbelievable talent,’ said the Golden Bear, who holds the all-time record with 18 majors.

‘It depends on what he feels his priorities are but I think he has the opportunity to win 15 or 20 majors if he wants to keep on playing.’

Nicklaus, who was speaking on ESPN radio, enthused: ‘I think Rory is an unbelievable talent. I love his swing, his rhythm, his spirit. He has got a little swagger there, it’s a little bit cocky but it is not offensive. I like that self-confidence in a young man.

‘He’s got an unbelievable amount of speed in his golf swing. He obviously hits it a long way but he does it consistently, with control.’

Nicklaus has been there for McIlroy ever since the latter played in Jack’s tournament in Florida in 2009.

In May, the pair had a 90-minute working lunch where McIlroy asked for the great man’s guidance. It cannot be just a coincidence that since then McIlroy has been playing with Nicklaus-like focus and turning in some of the best golf of his life.

At 22, McIlroy became the youngest winner of the US Open in 80 years when he started his major account in 2011 and broke Nicklaus’s record for the largest winning margin at the US PGA when he claimed that the following year by eight strokes. After winning The Open last month, he joined Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only men to win three majors by the age of 25.

Now he starts as firm favourite this week to add the season’s final major to The Open and the Bridgestone Invitational he won in his previous two outings.

One foe he would not have expected to come across was Woods, who had to withdraw during the final round of the Bridgestone on Sunday with back trouble.

To general astonishment and against all odds, Woods turned up at Valhalla  and went out for a practice round shortly after 2pm. Woods has won 14 majors but his last was in 2008 and his injury troubles over the last few years have shown that challenging Nicklaus’s record is so dependant on staying fit.

One man who was delighted to see Woods was US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson. ‘I’ve talked to him and texted him and I think the fact he is here tells me that he wants to make our team,’ said Watson, who also announced that Steve Stricker, who just happens to be Tiger’s best pal on tour, will be one of his vice-captains.

Stricker said it was vital for America’s chances at Gleneagles next month that Woods was able to get healthy.

‘I know how deeply he wants to be a part of this team and I think that’s why he is here at Valhalla,’ said Stricker. ‘He was on that last team at Medinah that didn’t get it done and he wants to help us make amends.

‘We will see how he gets on this week but hopefully he will come through it feeling healthy and he gets his game going in the right direction. We need him.’

Watson said he would leave it to Woods to decide whether he was fit enough for Gleneagles. ‘If he tells me he is healthy and he’s playing well, he will be on the team,’ he said.
