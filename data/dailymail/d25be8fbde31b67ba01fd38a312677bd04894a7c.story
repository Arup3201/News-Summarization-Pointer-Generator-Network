London mayor Boris Johnson did little to dispel his city's reputation for excessive consumption when he appeared in Jakarta today.

The weighty politician's midriff was all the more noticeable for its contrast to wasp-thin Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who cycled alongside him on a car-free day in Jakarta.

With Mr Johnson's 'London Is Great' T-shirt losing the battle to contain his chest fat, it seemed ironic the Tory big beast's itinerary included sharing the experience of running London's Olympic Games with local politicians.

But despite their physical disparity, Mr Johnson will be hoping he can share something in common with Mr Widodo: the Indonesian head of state enjoyed a meteoric rise to his country's top job after first becoming governor of Jakarta in 2012.

That's a route observers say Mr Johnson, who has been London mayor since 2008, is hoping to emulate, as speculation grows that Tory leader and current PM David Cameron is losing the support of his Conservative Party.

Mr Johnson is the first British politician to have a substantial meeting with President Widodo since his inauguration.

Ahead of the meeting, Mr Johnson said: 'I'm delighted to be back in Jakarta. I want to try and help cement our strong bilateral relations with Indonesia and further discussion on trade and business opportunities between two great and growing capital cities.

'I'm looking forward to sharing our experience of running the Olympic Games with the president as Indonesia prepares to host the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta.'

Mr Cameron met Mr Widodo briefly at this month's G20 meeting in Brisbane. The Prime Minister last visited Jakarta in February 2012 when he met Mr Widodo's predecessor.

The meeting between the president and Mr Johnson is expected to discuss Mr Widodo's G20 speech on the importance of free and fair trade, the importance of building on the UK's strong bilateral relations with Indonesia and shared engagement on education, trade and defence.

Interestingly for Mr Johnson, it will also discuss the president's recent election.

Indonesia is forecast to be the fifth biggest economy in the world by the mid-2020s. The country has a a huge and burgeoning middle class consumer market and it is the biggest Muslim country in the world.

Mr Johnson will seek to increase business opportunities for Britain.

Continuing his involvement in the ongoing UK Trade and Industry mission to the Far East, Mr Johnson will push to attract more British investment in Jakarta and Indonesia after research showed 69 per cent of Indonesians feel open to the UK.

The Jakarta visit is the latest stop on a six-day tour of the Far East for Mr Johnson. He was due later in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Yesterday the London Mayor was in Singapore where, although is used to dealing with some evasive types in the world of politics, a lizard still managed to get the better of him.

Mr Johnson playfully grabbed the creature’s tail before it scurried away during a visit to Singapore Botanic Gardens.

It was the third day of his Far East tour, where he is meeting world leaders.

The politician also viewed an orchid garden named after Margaret Thatcher, which was previously visited by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Set up in 1859, the 74-hectare Singapore gardens have been supported by Kew Gardens since 1877.

Mr Johnson was joined there by Kew scientists, who hope to help Singapore’s gardens receive world heritage site status.

He said: ‘Singapore’s relationship with one of our most quintessentially British brands is testament to the huge appetite there is for London’s expertise overseas.’
