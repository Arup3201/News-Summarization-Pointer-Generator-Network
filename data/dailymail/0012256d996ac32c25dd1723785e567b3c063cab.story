Sitting in the afternoon sun, Amanda Knox calmly writes in her journal while her fiancé, Colin Sutherland, watches over her.

The couple – who have known each other since their schooldays – look like any other young lovers enjoying a spring afternoon at home in Seattle.However, Knox, 27, is now just hours away from learning if she will become a convicted murderer for the second time when a court in Rome, some 5,000 miles away, delivers its verdict tomorrow.

Wearing a casual vest and jeans and with her short hair tied back in a knot, the creative writing graduate must have a number of things going through her mind to jot down as the new judgement over the bloody murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher in 2007 eases closer.

Knox served four years in prison after she was originally convicted of the crime alongside ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and Rudy Guede, but a second ruling in 2011 declared her innocent and she returned to her native US.

Amanda’s seemingly relaxed demeanour was a far cry from the telling body language of her mother, Edda Mellas, on Tuesday, the day before the new verdict had originally been due to be given.

Amanda's mother, Edda Mellas, has tried to distract herself with the family shopping  But she can barely hide her inner turmoil on behalf of her daughter, who once again faces the prospect of a life sentence behind bars for her alleged role in the death of British exchange student Kercher.

Edda had risen at around 05.30 am Wednesday morning at her home in Seattle and around an hour later was joined by ex-husband Curt Knox, 54, who lives nearby. No doubt they were waiting for the final verdict in the case, which has dragged on for eight years and already seen Knox and her co-accused, former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 30, acquitted once.

After the 2011 acquittal Knox, 28, returned to her hometown of Seattle, Washington, after having served four years in an Italian prison. She is currently believed to be staying at her mother's house.

However, the ruling was overturned in 2013, and Knox was handed a sentence of 28 and a half years in prison.

Her current case is an appeal against that sentence which could either be upheld – and see her once again declared guilty – acquit her entirely, or the case could be sent back for another round of appeals.

Physical and forensic evidence in the brutal murder of Kercher – who was stabbed and had her throat cut – has been hotly contested throughout the trials, as has both Knox and Sollecito's version of events that night.

Knox and her family now face another agonizing day before a new verdict is given.

Speaking at court in Rome on Wednesday, Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova said her 'conviction is not justice – but a distortion of the facts'.

In his closing statement he asked the court to overturn the guilty verdict, and added: 'We are confronted with a very grave judicial error that must be set right.'

Amanda is just hours away from learning her fate 

Raffaelle Sollecito changed his story earlier this week claiming he now does not remember whether Knox was with him at the time of Meredith Kercher's murder

Asked about how his client had been in the last few days, he said: 'Worried, very worried.'

Sollecito remains in Italy – where his passport has been confiscated to stop him fleeing - and was present for the hearing in court.

If Knox is convicted Italian courts will have to ask for her extradition, which will lead to another round of legalities in the US to determine whether or not she will finally be sent to prison again, and where.

That decision would ultimately be left in the hands of Secretary of State John Kerry. 

On Tuesday afternoon Edda, 52, a mathematics teacher in the Highline area of Seattle, had shopped for groceries at a local supermarket before heading to the West Seattle area of the city where she lives with husband Chris, 40, and daughters Ashley, 20, and Delaney, 15.

They appeared to have a number of visitors, who were no doubt wishing them luck with the scheduled verdict. However, after it was delayed, the curtains in the house remained closed all day Wednesday.

Since her return to Seattle, Knox has tried to get on with a normal life and had resumed studies at the University of Washington and even took on freelance work at a local newspaper, the West Seattle Herald.

She even found love, first with classical music student James Terrano and then with New York- based musician Colin Sutherland, whom she announced her engagement to in February of this year.

Knox has become increasingly distanced from Sollecito, who changed his story earlier this week, claiming he now does not remember whether Knox was with him at the time of Meredith Kercher's murder.

He claimed in documents presented to court on Tuesday he can't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night Kercher was murdered.

Markus Wiget, an Italian criminal trial lawyer claimed Sollecito was making the claims in a last ditch attempt to save his own skin.

He said: 'You could say he is throwing her to the wolves. It is bad for Amanda' s defense but it might not be good for Raffaele's defense either. The lawyers are probably trying this approach as a very last resort.'

One person, Rudy Guede, has already been convicted of murder, but the Italian courts have ruled he did not act alone.
