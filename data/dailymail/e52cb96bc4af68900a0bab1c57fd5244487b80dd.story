James Holmes sits in court during a hearing at the Arapahoe County Justice Center in Centennial, Colorado in 2013. His trial date has now been set for October of this year, but this could still suffer further delays

The Aurora theatre shooting suspect, also known as the 'Dark Knight gunman', James Holmes, has finally had a trial date set, for October 14, which will be more than two years after the attack.

Holmes has been charged with multiple accounts of first degree murder and attempted murder after the attack in July 2012 that killed 12 and injured 70 at a movie theatre in a suburb in Denver, Colorado, and he has pleaded not guilty to the attack by way of insanity.

Judge Carlos A. Samour set the date for later this year, but also said that it's possible that the trial date may suffer further delay, as the prosecution and defence attorneys argue over Holmes' sanity evaluations.

Judge Samour told lawyers at a court hearing that, among other factors, a mental health expert may ask for more time to examine Holmes.

'As much as I know people are eager to have this trial take place...I also want to make sure we're doing things right,' he said.

'We're all going to have to be flexible.'

Prosecutor Rich Orman said victims in the case want the trial to happen sooner.

He said: 'They prefer that the 
trial had started long ago.'

The Judge said: 'I understand those wishes, but 
there's nothing I can do about it. I'm not going to allow things to be 
rushed.'

Holmes has previously had a psychological evaluation to determine the legitimacy of the sanity plea, but the results have been kept confidential, and a second evaluation has been requested by the prosecution.

In addition, defense lawyers have conceded Holmes was the 
lone gunman in the shooting, but say he was in
 the midst of a psychotic episode during the rampage.

The trial date has been set in October to give time for the lengthy process of jury selection to take place.

6,000 potential jurors will be summoned, and those who respond will be interviewed by lawyers at a rate of 300 a day for two weeks to make the panel.

At the hearing, Holmes wore a red jail uniform and sat quietly at the defense table, his hair and beard long and brown, a striking difference to the dyed orange hair that he sported after he was arrested.

Holmes' lawyer, Tamara Brady, told the judge that Holmes would challenge the judicial order on February that granted a prosecution request that he undergo a second mental evaluation.

The defense lawyer said 'That could delay things as well' in addition to asking that the trial be postponed further.

Brady also said that it was likely that 
Holmes would request that the psychological evaluation be postponed 
until the matter is resolved.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, which, like the insanity plea, is a factor that means extra time in court for special arguments.

The original trial date was in August 2013, but was pushed to February 2014 after prosecutors announced they were seeking the death penalty.

The February date was then abandoned when prosecutors requested that Holmes undergo a second mental health evaluation.

In granting the request for a second mental evaluation, Samour said the first evaluation by the state mental hospital was 'incomplete and inadequate.'
