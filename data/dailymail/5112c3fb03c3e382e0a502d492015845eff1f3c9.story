It seems that Urban Meyer's good luck has finally run out.

A little over a month after leading the Ohio State Buckeyes to the national championship, Meyer is stuck at sea on a cruise ship with thousands of college football fans. 

This as he was the guest of honor at an annual cancer fundraiser.

The ship was forced to circle the waters for 24 hours before docking in Tampa Tuesday night.

The Royal Caribbean ship Brilliance of the Seas was expected to dock on Monday, but due to severe fog it had been forced to wait in the waters off Florida as Tampa had to close its port.

This however did not seem to be bother any of the 2,160 guests on board.

'We’re all Buckeyes, we’re all from Ohio,' Lanne Bennett told ABC News. 

'We’ve weathered worse things.'

She also added that the trip has 'been absolutely amazing.' 

There is certainly plenty to do on board as well, with six pools for guests, 16 bars and lounges and over 100 spa treatments. 

Food and water are also not a problem, as the ship has plenty, and should anything happen the captain would be able to bring the ship to another port.

Guests will be able to spend the night on board Tuesday and leave Wednesday.

This comes just one year after 689 of 4,237 passengers and crew became very ill while aboard the Royal Caribbean ship Explorer of the Seas due to an outbreak of norovirus.

That ship docked two days early, and guests were given 50percent of their money back.

Brilliance of the Seas was previously in the news when in 2005 a guest is believed to have fallen off of one of the balconies and died, a case which the company settled for $1million.
