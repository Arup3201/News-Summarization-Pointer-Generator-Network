Three years after an unidentified woman was found abandoned in a hospital waiting room, wearing only an adult diaper and hospital gown, Alabama authorities have found her name and the person who was supposed to be caring for her.

Unable to speak, and with no identification, Edith Allen's history had been a mystery until Monday. Her carers had scant clues to go on - just a cesarean section scar and initials in her dentures.

However, a tip off finally led authorities to Ms Allen's carer Cathy Jean Thomas, of Douglasville, Georgia, who faces charges of claiming more than $25,000 in Ms Allen's social security checks over the past three years.

Named: Three years after she was found abandoned, Edith Allen has her identity back

'It's a relief to me. It's been a long, 
drawn-out process over something that should have never happened,'Â Alabama Bureau of Investigation agent Lieutenant Scott 
Bartle, who has led the search for Ms Allen's identity, told Al.com.

Because Ms Allen, who was named Sally by the medical staff who have cared for her since she was found in August 2010, did not have an identity she was unable to qualify for Medicaid.

The 68-year-old woman, who had a urinary tract infection, and was dehydrated and malnourished when she was found, has built up medical bills of $200,000 in the past three years.

Although she can barely speak and has learning disabilities, Ms Allen did try to help authorities identify her.

'She would attempt to write her name and, what's really sad, is, if you look at the name she was attempting to give the hospitals here in Oneonta, it matches the name and the signature that she would give to the adult day care she stayed at in Georgia,' Blount County district attorney Pamela Casey said.

From the start, officers feared someone may still be claiming her social security checks.

Thomas, 59, became the disabled woman's carer in 2009 and, according to authorities, 
filled out the necessary paperwork to take charge of Ms Allen's social 
security benefits.

'Thomas
did acknowledge receiving Edith Allen's money and using it to obtain 
goods and services that never went to Allen,' Lieutenant Bartle said. 'For three 
years, she has reaped the benefits of those checks.'

Charged: Cathy Jean Thomas, who was Edith Allen's carer, is accused of identity theft

He added that Thomas, who has been charged with identity theft, denied being the one who abandoned Ms Allen, who weighed less than 90lb when she was found at the hospital.

Ms Allen was originally cared for by Thomas's sister until she died, which was when Thomas took over, according to Al.com.

The search for Ms Allen's identity was further hampered because her short blonde hair had been dyed dark and she was wearing large, black-rimmed glasses when she was found, possibly in an attempt to disguise her.

Several newspaper articles and television reports featured her story, and fingerprints and DNA were taken in the hope of finding a match in missing persons databases.

'The Alabama Bureau of Investigation probably followed over 1,000 to 2,000 leads,' Ms Casey told ABC3340.

In 2011 Ms Allen's new carers spoke to the press again in the hope of finding her relatives, or anyone who knew her. Although they did not provide immediate leads, her story was carried on various social media sites, which eventually helped identify her.

After a tip off to LostNMissing, a non-profit volunteer group, officials were able to match Ms Allen with her medical and financial records.

Thomas has since been charged and is being held on a $50,000 bond.

Ms Casey said she now wants to pass Edith's Law, which would give more security to those with learning disabilities and help stop others being treated in the same way as Ms Allen was.

'We have to do something about this. We have to be able to identify these people and we have to make sure the benefits that are provided to them are actually going to them and for them,' she said.

Ms Allen's court-appointed guardian, attorney Sid Summey, is thrilled that her identity has been revealed.

'A lot of compassion has poured out for this lady. Many have expressed an interest and concern in finding her identity so she wouldn't have "Jane Sally Doe" on her tombstone. That's not going to happen now, and we're delighted,' he said.

Ms Allen, who has no living relatives, will remain in her nursing home.

'Our intent is for her to remain in our care until or unless her circumstance changes,' Mr Summey said. 'She will stay with us, but now with her rightful name.'
