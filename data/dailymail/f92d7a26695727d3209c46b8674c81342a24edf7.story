A spurned husband exacted revenge on his former wife during divorce proceedings by sawing their furniture into pieces and labelling half of them as his.

Kevin Fiore, 56, caused £5,184 of damage to the £130,000 house in Werrington, Staffordshire, which he shared with wife Katrina, who walked out on him in March 2011.

The father-of-two, who had been married to the 39-year-old for three years after a 14 year relationship, hacked the sofa in half and wrote 'Kev's half' on the cushions.

A wardrobe, dressing table and two sets of drawers faced the wrath of the jilted man, who also tore down the loft ladder, trashed the bathroom and scrawled offensive messages on the walls.

Fiore, a bankrupt builder who now lives with his daughter from another relationship, pleaded guilty to criminal damage and walked away from Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court with a two-year supervision order as the judge called his antics 'mean and unpleasant'.

Judge Mark Eades told him: 'This was a piece of revenge upon your ex-partner.

'It was mean and unpleasant but, at the end of the day, it was only property, and the value falls firmly in the magistrates’ court bracket.

'Therefore I’m going to be mindful of the magistrates’ court guidelines.'

The court heard how Mrs Fiore had walked out on her husband, with whom she has a son, in March last year.

Fiona Cortese, prosecuting, said: 'On
September 10 Mrs Fiore received a text message that said "There's 
nothing left, it's all trashed".

'As a result, Mrs Fiore went to the address and found various things had been damaged.'

Fiore sent an apologetic text to his wife the next day.

He was arrested and told police he had 'lost it' and that everything had gone wrong.

The court was told that Fiore had 
tried to sell the house but an estate agent said the garage, utility 
room and loft conversion would have to be demolished first because they 
were built without planning permission.

Colin Drew, defending, said his client was depressed and was being financially supported by his grown-up daughter.

He said: 'His total bankruptcy is approximately £62,000. He was a self-employed builder.

'He is out of work at the moment. He is signed off by his doctor because he has been suffering from depression.'

Mrs Fiores was not awarded compensation by the court because of her ex-husband's financial situation.

After the sentencing, Mrs Fiore revealed the moment she discovered her house had been ransacked.

She said: ‘I told him I wanted a divorce but he refused to accept it.

‘He texted me telling me he'd trashed the house and I went round there with our son and just cried when I saw what he'd done.

‘We had a lovely expensive cream leather sofa which he'd sawn in half and scrawled 'Kev's Half' in black marker on the cushions.

‘I just cried when I walked round the house. ‘I am shocked that the judge let him walk free.

‘He deserved to be jailed for what he did to me and my family, I can't stand to look at him now.

‘I want him out of my life for good but I have to see him in court to discuss access to our son.’

She also spoke about her ‘deeply unhappy’ marriage to the builder.

Mrs Fiore said: ‘We were together for 14 years but got married four years ago in July 2008. I decided to call it a day because we'd simply grown apart.

‘We had nothing in common anymore and I didn't enjoy his company. He didn't do anything wrong really but I just didn't want to be with him anymore.’
