Yaya Toure sat out of training on Saturday, three days before the Ivory Coast are set to play their opening fixture at the African Cup of Nations. 

The four time African Player of the Year was stretched on the sidelines as his team-mates practiced for the first time since arriving in Equatorial Guinea at a small stadium in Malabo.

The Ivory Coast open play in Group D on Tuesday against Guinea at Estadio de Malabo, and it was unclear if Toure would be able to play. Mali will face Cameroon later that night.

Toure is a key player for both his country and Premier League club Manchester City and has been in superb form this season, scoring nine goals in 26 games in all competitions.   

He won his record-equaling fourth African Player of the Year award earlier this month, putting him level with Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o.
