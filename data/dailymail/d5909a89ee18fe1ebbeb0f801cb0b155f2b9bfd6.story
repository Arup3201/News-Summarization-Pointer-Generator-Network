Tragedy: Rukshana Miah, 35, has died after she was allegedly attacked at home by her husband

A teacher who was left fighting for her life after she was allegedly attacked at home by her husband has died. 

Mother-of-two Rukshana Miah, 35, was taken to hospital after the alleged assault in north Reddish, Stockport, on August 18, but died on Saturday.

A Home Office post mortem examination concluded her death was as a result of compression on the neck.

Her husband, Abdul Kashem Miah, 36, was charged with attempted murder, and police and prosecutors are now reviewing the charge in the wake of Mrs Miah's death.

He appeared at Stockport Magistrates’ Court last Wednesday and is due to appear before a judge at Manchester Crown Court on September 10.

Mrs Miah's family said in a statement: 'Rukshana was a wonderful daughter, mother, sister, aunty, cousin and friend who will be greatly missed by us all.'

Her colleagues at Broadoak Primary School in Ashton-under-Lyne also paid tribute to the popular teacher. 

'Rukshana Miah was a wonderful and talented teacher at Broadoak Primary School in Ashton who touched the lives of everyone she met,' said headteacher Des Howlett. 

'Rukshana was the heart of the school, an outstanding teacher who was devoted to the success of the children that she taught. She always wanted to be the best and for her children to be the best and her belief that anything was possible if you work hard enough had an impact on everyone she met.

'Ruk was full of life and passion for the children that she taught and friends that she made. That same wonderful smile greeted every challenge, every child and every joke alike and her many friends knew that their friendships were firm and valuable. 

'She made us laugh and will continue to do so as we share memories and remember her jokes. We were and always will be extremely proud of having Rukshana as a teacher at our school and as a friend. She was a natural teacher and a great friend and colleague. We are all very proud to have known her.

'Ruk herself would always say that her greatest achievement was her children and her love and pride for them shone through every day. She was a fantastic mother who knew that time was precious and so was always doing something with them or taking them to places. They were her life and made her laugh whether she liked it or not. She brought them up to be respectful and polite but they have Ruk’s own wonderful cheekiness and sense of fun. They will continue to be a credit to her.

Mother:Mrs Miah's colleague Des Howlett said she was a 'fantastic' mother and a 'wonderful teacher'

'Her loss is absolutely devastating. Ruk was the best of us and will always be remembered. Our thoughts are with Ruk’s children and family at this terrible time. Broadoak will be a sadder place without her, we have lost one of the best.'

Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington of Greater Manchester Police confirmed that officers had launched a murder investigation following her death.

'Sadly Ruckshana's injuries proved fatal and a murder investigation is now underway,' he said.

'Devastated': Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington said it was 'simply heartbreaking' that Mrs Miah's two children would be growing up without a mother

Home: Mrs Miah was attacked at her home on this leafy residential street in Stockport

'Her family are clearly devastated and we would ask they be given time and space to grieve and come to terms with her tragic death.

'Ruckshana was a mother to two young children, who now face having to grow up and live the rest of their lives without her, and that is simply heartbreaking.

'We have charged one man in connection with this incident and now, following her death, will be reviewing the charges against him in consultation with the CPS.'
