Civil servants spent thousands of working hours visiting a cricket website over the summer when England’s Ashes battle with Australia was in full swing, new figures have revealed.

Mandarins at the Treasury, the Department of Health and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) face accusations of wasting time after they logged on to cricket website espncricinfo.com at least four million times from January to August this year.

The five-Test Ashes series ran from July to the end of August. With the nation transfixed by the fluctuating fortunes of the teams, civil servants were able to keep track of all the twists and turns of the five match Test series from their desks.

Defra calculated its staff spent 1,810 hours connected to the cricket website over a five-month period, clicking on it nearly 850,000 times.

But Whitehall insiders said that although staff may have logged on to the site in the morning, they would not have spent all those hours glued to it because they would have then opened other work-related pages and checked on the cricket only occasionally.

Time consuming: MP Nick de Bois said there should be less time-consuming ways for Government employees to keep track of the Ashes score. 'I can understand the appetite for the Ashes, but it might be cheaper for the Sports Minister to update fans with the odd email now and then.' he said

Figures are not available for how many hours the other two departments spent logged on to the site, though Treasury officials visited it nearly 2.5 million times over six months, while Department of Health staff visited it on more than 1.5 million occasions over seven months – far more than their Defra counterparts.

Conservative MP and cricket fan Priti Patel said civil servants should have saved their Ashes fever until after working hours. ‘While we should get behind our team, civil servants should spend the time they are paid  to work focused on doing their jobs rather than following cricket.’

Fellow MP Nick de Bois said there should be less time-consuming ways for Government employees to keep track of the Ashes score.

‘I
 can understand the appetite for the Ashes, but it might be cheaper for 
the Sports Minister to update fans with the odd email now and then.’

The
 figures, revealed following a number of Freedom of Information Act 
requests, also found that Defra staff spent 2,600 hours on Facebook, 
‘hitting’ the site nearly four million times. Treasury staff also 
visited it four million times, while those at the DoH visited it ten 
million times. A Defra 
spokesman said: ‘The number of hits is not necessarily reflective of the
 time spent on these sites. Any misuse of work time by staff is taken 
seriously by the department.’

A DoH spokesman said: ‘Limited personal access to the internet is allowed as long as it doesn’t interfere with day-to-day work.’
