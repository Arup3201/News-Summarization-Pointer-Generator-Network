The Norwegian ‘Slow-TV’ movement has been a surprising success in its home country, and the concept is now being taken across the pond.

Norway has developed an international reputation for its series of 'Slow-TV' programmes, including a live-broadcast of a seven-hour train journey and the creation of a sweater, from sheep to knitted garment.

Los Angeles-based production company LMNO Productions, has bought the U.S. rights to the concept and is set to start making ‘ambiance shows’ for the American audience this year.

LMNO Productions, which also makes TLC's The Little Couple', are hoping to adapt the concept to reflect American past-times such as wildlife observing and cross-country travel, and hope to be premiering their first shows as early as this summer.

‘It doesn’t compete for your attention,' Lori Rothschild Ansaldi of LMNO said.

'In a world where we have this many channels and every channel has a docu-soap about some outrageous personality who lives unapologetically and sort of yells at us, as television viewers... This was just the opposite.

'This one allows you to watch and just sit back and relax. Not in a boring way but in a really "that’s different" sort of way. It allows you to breathe.’

The Norwegian ‘Slow TV’ was born on state broadcaster NRK in 2009 with centenary of the Bergen railway line.

Rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line, NRK instead decided to stick a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven-hour trip from Oslo to Bergen, interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme.

Remarkably, it was a roaring success, with 1.2 million viewers, nearly a quarter of the population of Norway, tuning in for at least part of the trip.

Since then, the network has broadcast a cruise journey, a fire being slowly built and burned, and more recently, the knitting of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came.

Earlier this month, the tax-funded channel began the online broadcast of Piipshow, a live stream of birds and squirrels hanging out in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop.

The show is due to air until June 2014, with the best action usually taking place during daylight hours. Fans can watch live via NRK's website.
