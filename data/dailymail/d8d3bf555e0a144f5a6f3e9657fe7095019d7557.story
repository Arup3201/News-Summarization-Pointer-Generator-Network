The hospital trust accused of a cover-up over cancer treatment has the worst waiting times figures in the country, it has emerged.

Police are probing Colchester Hospital University over claims staff concealed how long it took to treat sufferers.

Since details of the scandal emerged last month, it has gone from being officially one of the best for cancer waiting times to the worst, and could be fined tens of thousands of pounds.

Only 93 per cent of patients were treated within 31 days of being seen by a doctor at the trust's hospital in Colchester

National targets say at least 95 per cent of cancer patients should be treated within 31 days of a doctor deciding the most suitable option.

But at Colchester just 93 per cent of patients were treated in this time frame meaning 22 were made to wait longer in the last three months alone.

And before the probe was launched the trust claimed 98 per cent had treatment within this time putting it amongst the top 30 in the country.

The trust is now expected to be fined by the NHS regional body - North Essex Clinical Commissioning Group - which could be in the region of tens of thousands of pounds.

Meanwhile the trust’s £165,000-a-year chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts has again refused to resign insisting he was spearheading a culture of openness.

Speaking yesterday, he added: ‘I do my very best to live up to those values - to be open, to be available and to be visible around the trust.

‘We have to create a culture where people can speak up. It takes a lot of courage.

‘We need to be better at listening to concerns and encouraging people to raise them.’

If Essex Police find enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing, staff could face jail.

The probe was launched after whistleblowers told the Care Quality Commission they were being bullied by senior managers to change waiting times figures.

Some patients were being made to wait four months for life-saving treatment and the hospital faced being heavily fined for missing these targets.

And former staff at the trust have told how Dr Coutts made their life hell and presided over a culture obsessed with meeting targets.

His personal assistant Mandy Tapfield is said to have recently quit after 28 years at the hospital, claiming her ‘life was made hell’.

The 56-year-old, who was his executive PA until last month, claims she left because she could no longer tolerate Dr Coutts’s demands.
