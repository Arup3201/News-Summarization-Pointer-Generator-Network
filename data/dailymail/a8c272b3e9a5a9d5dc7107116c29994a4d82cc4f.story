Michael Ballack believes Germany must start with both Mesut Ozil and Mario Gotze at the World Cup.

There is a feeling in Germany that coach Joachim Low may have room for just one of the playmakers in his side.

But former captain Ballack insists players of the talent of Arsenal's Ozil and Bayern Munich's Gotze should be accommodated.

Talent: Former Germany captain Ballack says both Ozil and Gotze should be accommodated in Joachim Low's side

The 37-year-old told The Independent: ‘If you see the talent Ozil and Gotze have, they both need their space. For good players there is always space in the team but they both like to play in the middle, behind the strikers.

‘In the past they didn’t really play together, or one played on the wing. Low chooses sometimes to play Gotze as a striker, which I think is not his best position and he can’t perform as well there compared to when he plays as a No 10.

‘It’s a big decision for the coach, especially now with just one striker going in the squad (Miroslav Klose), it looks like one of the two – maybe Gotze – will be playing up front. For their quality, I think they have to play both.’
