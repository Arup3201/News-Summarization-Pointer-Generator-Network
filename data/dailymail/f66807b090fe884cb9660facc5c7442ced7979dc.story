William Hayden, 49, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with the rape of an 11-years-old girl

Reality show 'Sons of Guns' has been cancelled following the arrest of star William Hayden on child rape charges. 

In a statement to TMZ on Wednesday, a Discovery channel spokesman wrote: 'Given the serious and horrific nature of the charges against Will Hayden, we have decided to halt further production of Sons of Guns and cancel the series.'

The series focused on the custom firearm store in Louisiana that Hayden founded.

Hayden was arrested yesterday and  charged with the aggravated rape of a girl who was just 11-years-old at the time of the alleged offence.

The 49-year-old was apprehended as a fugitive on Tuesday in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, two weeks after being accused of child molestation, according to East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office.

The girl is now backing up the allegations and says she was orally and vaginally raped almost daily, but did not report it because he threatened her physically.

She told investigators that Hayden took her virginity in March 2013 when she was 11-years-old.

The alleged victim did not want to disclose any information at first because Hayden allegedly intimidated her and said: ‘Don't tell them nothing, because I'm all you got.'

Hayden, a former Marine whose show airs on the Discovery Channel, was also arrested on August 9 for child molestation.

But he insisted that the claims were the work of a bitter ex-girlfriend who told authorities that he had molested the girl to get back at him for breaking up with her.

The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released, according to the sheriff's website.

When the case was sealed by a judge, Hayden told TMZ that his ex-girlfriend, who is mother to one of his daughters, went to authorities and accused him of molesting the girl.

Sons of Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and follows Hayden's life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms, in Louisiana.

It is not his first brush with the law, as Hayden was investigated in 2009 over ten unregistered guns by the U.S. Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

Relatives filed a lawsuit against him in 2013, claiming he and his ex-wife had previously given them shares in the company - before transferring part of the company to a new name and rendering the shares worthless.

But his attorney argued that he had transferred some of the business to comply with the ATF and federal regulations regarding automatic firearms and had never intended to deceive anyone.
