Promotions for payday loans that suggest they could fund shopping sprees, birthday celebrations or buying an engagement ring have been branded irresponsible.

Citizens Advice has compiled a list of marketing initiatives that may have broken advertising rules.

Alleged breaches across TV ads, texts, emails, flyers and even on a sandwich wrapper include not declaring the cost of a loan – which can top 5,000 per cent APR interest – and suggesting frivolous uses.

Investigation: Wonga is one of six companies accused of 'frivolous' advertising exposed to children

The Advertising Standards Authority and Financial Conduct Authority are to investigate the claims, which involve six lenders including Wonga, PoundstoPocket and Peachy.co.uk.

Firms have also been accused of trying to normalise loans through daytime TV ads when children are watching.

Citizens Advice wants a ban on ads that trivialise the loans by suggesting they can be used for treats.

Chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘Animations, cheery puns and suggestions that loans could fund a shopping spree are a far cry away from the reality of payday lending many of our clients’ experience.’

A birthday email from Pounds to Pocket implied a short term loan could be used to pay for birthday celebrations.

The firm KDS Finance Love2shop was issuing voucher flyers suggesting its short-term loans could be used for shopping, which Citizens Advice said was irresponsible and trivialised taking out a loan.

Citizens Advice warn people are tricked into believing they can borrow money for simple treats

A TV commercial for Wonga set in a café suggested a loan could be taken out to cope with unspecified ‘financial quandaries’ and failed to show the cost of the loan.

A promotional film made by the same company featuring 12 case studies of people who had borrowed from the company has also been criticised.

Citizens Advice said it did not contain any details on interest rates, while it implied one of its loans was a suitable way to pay for an engagement ring.

Peachy.co.uk ran adverts for its loans on sandwich wrappers. Citizens Advice said it is irresponsible to promote borrowing in this way and that the ad made unsubstantiated claims the firm’s loans were cheaper than available elsewhere.

The chief executive of Citizens Advice has said that every day the charity had to help deal with the 'devastation caused by irresponsible payday lending' (file picture posed by models)

A text message from loan-monarch suggested the company gives money to 98per cent of people who apply. However the firm is actually a credit broker which passes on applicants to other companies and does not provide loans directly.

Similarly, a text message from spends4u.co.uk claimed a loan could be approved ‘today’, when it is also a credit broker, rather than a loans company.

The message said a loan could be offered ‘no matter what your circumstances’, which was either misleading or ‘very irresponsible’.

One of the key concerns about these loans is that they have been given to people who have no means of making repayments, so leaving them open to penalty charges.

Miss Guy said: ‘Day in day out Citizens Advice is helping people deal with the devastation caused by irresponsible payday lending.

‘Loans taken out to cover a short-fall have turned into a long-term nightmare as people struggle to keep up with payments, and high charges increase debts further.’

She added: ‘Borrowing money is a very serious step and people need to be aware of all of the facts before they sign-up.  Consumers cannot make informed decisions if the adverts are irresponsible and misleading.

‘The complaints made today are a strong reflection on the public distaste for financial products that exploit people and drive individuals deep into debt.

‘We’d like to thank those who have taken time to make a stand against irresponsible adverts by reporting them to Citizens Advice and encourage others to tell us about other inappropriate adverts.’

'Borrowing money is a very serious step 
and people need to be aware of all of the facts before they sign-up.  
Consumers cannot make informed decisions if the adverts are 
irresponsible and misleading' 

- Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy

Citizens Advice has long been calling for health warning on payday loan adverts. It also wants financial services companies to be banned from cold calling which would mean payday lenders could not text, email or ring people out of the blue offering them loans.

As part of the charity’s campaign to clean-up the payday loan industry, Citizens Advice has been pressing authorities to take action on irresponsible advertising and Chief Executive Gillian Guy has spoken out about the use of celebrities, such as Kerry Katona, to endorse financial products.

The ASA will take evidence from the companies to defend the promotions before it rules whether they broke industry advertising rules. The organisation has indicated it is willing to ban payday loan ads which trivialise borrowing.

The firms insisted all of their marketing is checked to ensure it meets industry rules before it goes public.

Wonga said: ‘As a responsible business, our advertising is rigorously checked before it is aired and we look forward to engaging with the ASA should they have concerns.’

The founder of Peachy, Kristjan Novitski, said: ‘As a company we have spent a lot of time, energy and money on ensuring we maintain rigorous standards.

‘Although we do not agree that our advert presents a casual attitude to taking out a loan, nor does it suggest that a loan with us is cheaper than elsewhere, we will look into the complaint as a matter of urgency to ensure that any future advertising does not cause similar confusion.’
