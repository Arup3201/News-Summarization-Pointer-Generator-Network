Tourists from around the world are flocking to a vineyard at the renowned location where the British TV classic Last of the Summer Wine was filmed.

While the programme’s popularity helps, the real reason holidaymakers from as far as Argentina and Australia are visiting Holmfirth Vineyard is to witness a grape-growing miracle.

Britain’s highest vineyard, located in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, manages to produce wine 840ft above sea level on vines that survive sub-zero temperatures.

Holmfirth Vineyard is a draw for tourists as it manages to produce wine 840ft above sea level

It is achieving the feat as the UK wine industry gains credibility with experts and consumers around the world.

Long the butt of French jokes, Britain has been recognised as a premium wine-producing region with more than 400 vineyards in England and Wales producing sparkling and still wines, an increase of 50 per cent compared with last year.

Holmfirth Vineyard, which has a restaurant and holiday accommodation, is a home-grown success story.

It is owned by Ian and Rebecca Sheveling, who met while studying design at university.

Ian went into manufacturing and Rebecca designed seats for Formula 1 cars, but they soon decided that they wanted to open a vineyard.

In 2006 they bought an old sheep farm and the first vines were planted a year later.

Luke Tankard, Holmfirth Vineyard’s general manager and winemaker, said people are interested in its novelty value.

He said: ‘I think people want to satisfy their curiosity about how we can make wine on a hillside so high up.

‘When they arrive at the car park, they are hugely surprised. Their first reaction is what a beautiful view it is and then they say: “I didn’t know you could grow grapes up here.” They are amazed.

‘Sometimes the wind and rain is lashing down - we get more bad days than good weather-wise.’

Wine production at Holmfirth Vineyard has increased from 2,500 bottles in 2010 to 12,000 last year

Holmfirth Vineyard is drawing even more tourists after seven flats were built in a disused quarry last year.

It is now listed alongside those other bastions of northern English viticulture – Driffield, York and Leventhorpe near Leeds.

Luke said hardiness is the key to producing wine on the Pennine snow line.

For the basic root stock it has selected hybrid vines which thrive in cool climates.

Luke said: ‘These vines have to work a lot harder than normal vines, which just like to sunbathe.

‘Ours have to survive frost and attacks in the soil; they can survive temperatures of -25C.

‘We have turned a huge corner here, both in terms of the quality and the quantity of our wines. After two good summers our sugar and acidity levels are balancing out nicely.’

Holmfirth Vineyard grows several grape varieties, including Solaris, Seyval, Siegerebbe and Madeleine Angevine for white wines.

Luke said: ‘The white Solaris wine is our most popular, it’s like England’s answer to Sauvignon Blanc - and it comes out at 12.5 per cent.’

With the rise in popularity the vineyard has grown its footprint to 7,000 vines over seven acres.

When the winery was built in 2010 it harvested 2,500 bottles a year. This year the output topped 12,000 bottles which sell for £14.99 each.

Before the wine is bottled the grapes go into a machine to remove the bitter stalk, which is recycled as compost.

The grapes are then crushed with the skin and pips being used for pig food before going into stainless steel fermentation vessels for up to six months to develop body and character.

Despite the frost, December has been a busy month for maintenance and pruning at the vineyard.

Luke said: ‘We are expecting a cold winter, which won’t be much of a problem as the vines will hibernate.

‘But next year what we really want are sunny days with a little light rain at night.’
