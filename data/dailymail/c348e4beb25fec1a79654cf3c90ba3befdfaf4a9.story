Meet Milly the Chihuahua who has just been crowned the world's smallest dog at just 3.8 inches high.

The micro mutt who lives with her Argentine owners in the north east Puerto Rican town of Vega Alta, was so small when she was born back in December 2011 she had to be fed with an eye dropper and could fit in a teaspoon.

And despite being fed almost entirely on gourmet food, she failed to grow much larger than the size of an ordinary Chihuahua puppy, now weighing around a pound.

Paws for applause: 3.8in high Milly the chihuahua has been crowned the world's smallest living dog by Guinness World Record officials

Milly is constantly accompanied by Ms Eizzil or by her owner, 
Argentinian Vanessa Semler, who is dedicated to rearing chihuahuas in 
Puerto Rico.

Ms
 Semler says caring for Milly takes effort, but explains that she and 
her husband, Edwin Davila, have no children so they have the time to 
focus their energies on their pet project.

Delighted owner Vanessa Semler said: 'We have to be really careful with Milly because she is too small so she 
can be easily lost.

'When people see Milly they are really surprised because she is so small but they really love her because she ís so adorable.'

Noteworthy: Little Milly was had to be fed using an eyedropper as a puppy and was so small she could fit on a teaspoon

Smallest bar none: Milly measures up against a Hershey's bar. She replaces previous record holder Boo Boo the chihuahua who had held the top dog spot since February 2008

Milly, who sleeps in a baby's crib, beat previous title-holder Boo Boo, a 
long-haired female Chihuahua, owned by Lana Elswick of Raceland, 
Kentucky, who at 4.2inches towers 
over the new record holder.

Pocket-sized
 pets remain one of the most fascinating areas of the Guinness World 
Records database, with petite dogs arguably the most popular of all our 
animal records.

Born in 
December 2011, she weighs roughly 1 pound (half a kilogram) and is known
 for often sticking out her tiny tongue when someone takes her picture. 
'She knows how to pose,' says Vanesa. 

Dog-eared: The owners of Milly the chihuahua said they were delighted at the news

Pocket pedigree: Weighing only a single pound, the chihuahua from Puerto Rico requires special care

'People are amazed when they see her because she is so small, and she has a big personality. People love her.'

When
 she was born, Miracle Milly weighed less than an ounce and fit in a 
teaspoon, Semler said. Her mouth was too tiny to nurse from her mother, 
so Semler gave her milk every two hours through an eyedropper.

Chihuahuas originated from the state of Mexico that carries same name and they usually reach a height of between 15cm and 25cm.

Puppy love: Despite being fed entirely on gourmet human-cooked food Milly fhas failed to grow any larger than the average  Chihuahua puppy

Dog fight: Boo Boo, a long-haired, female chihuahua was the former 
holder of the title of World's Smallest Dog. She measures 10.16cm tall 
and is owned by Lana Elswick of Raceland, Kentucky
