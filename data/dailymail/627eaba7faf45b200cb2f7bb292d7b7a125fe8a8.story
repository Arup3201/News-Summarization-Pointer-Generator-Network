Fashion giant Vogue has signed a landmark 10 point code over the treatment of models on shoots and in shows.

Equity, the modelling union has reached an agreement with British Vogue on the code of conduct to be followed to try and improve the working environment of models.

Models must be given time to eat on shoots and informed consent on nudity according to the new code.

British Vogue have signed on to observe a 10-point code over the treatment of models, aimed to improve conditions in the industry

Modelling may look glamorous but it can involve incredibly long days, with, in some cases no breaks for hours on end and mistreatment both at catwalk shows and shoots

Working days are also limited to 10 hours, with no more than five hours without a break.

While these demands may seem basic, Equity reports that they are not followed in the industry today, with models being forced to work 20 hour days with no break, being ‘surprised’ with nudity in a shoot, and even being told off for pausing to eat or go to the toilet.

The Model Code will stipulate whether or not nudity is involved in a shoot before a model agrees to it, and ensure they are well treated while working.

At present, a request to take off their clothes can be made during a shoot with no prior warning and a model can find it difficult to refuse or to fully consider whether they want to do it.

Alexandra Shulman, Editor of British Vogue, who are the first publication to sign up to the Model Code

Model Sara Ziff, who founded Model Alliance, which offers support for those in the fashion industry, says this code is necessary.

Speaking to the Guardian she says: 'To many, fashion seems fun and frivolous, and so it follows that modelling is seen more as a privilege than a job. This is wrong. The industry's glossy veneer camouflages the sometimes harsh realities of working as a model.

‘As someone who, on occasion, has worked 20-hour days and been admonished for so much as asking to use the toilet, the Equity and Vogue code represents a welcome change.

‘In an industry that relies on a labour force of minors who know they are highly replaceable and who are often too timid to say no to such demands, this important protection is long overdue.’

Equity say on their website that: ‘Models hired by British Vogue for editorial work will now get assurances on hours of work, breaks, food, transport, nudity and semi-nudity, temperature, changing rooms and prompt payment. 

‘British Vogue readers can also be assured that all models in Vogue’s editorial are employed in line with the Code, and additionally that models under 16 years of age will not be used in photoshoots representing adult models.’

British and American Vogue have both already pledged not to use models under 16 or who appear to have an eating disorder.

Equity hope that many other magazines and publications will now follow in Vogue’s footsteps and sign the code.

Many models, like Kate Moss, begin their career at a very young age, and there is currently very little industry regulation over their treatment
