The average Briton has just four people they completely trust, according to a study.

Despite most people having hundreds of ‘friends’ on social media, the research showed we can only truly put our faith in a handful of people.

The research was carried out by TV channel Pick to mark the launch of new show Siberia, which follows the struggles of a group of reality TV contestants who must trust each other to survive in the wild.

A Pick spokesman said: ‘In a world where you can connect with friends at the click of a button, it’s surprising that most of us only actually trust four people.

‘The research shows the people we trust are key to our lives, but it’s extreme situations that really test the boundaries of who we trust or betray.’

More than half of those who took part in the survey also said they would never forgive someone who betrayed them, while the survey also found that men are more trusting than women and are quicker to forgive a betrayal of trust.

The reality show follows 16 contestants who have been left in the Siberian wilderness of Tunguska. The programme starts today on Pick  at 9pm.
