Based on its estimated global earnings, this would be the equivalent of paying tax at less than 2 per cent.

The global firms’ lack of corporation tax contributions were revealed to Parliament by Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, a former tax lawyer.

Overall ten technology companies in receipt of more than £1.8billion of taxpayers’ money paid only £78million in taxes on UK earnings of £17.5billion.

Mr Elphicke revealed the figures in a debate on corporation tax. He said: ‘We are seeing big business tax avoidance on an industrial scale. It’s unacceptable, unethical and irresponsible.
