Desperately ill Ashya King was left alone in hospital last night after his parents were locked up for a further 72 hours.

Brett and Naghmeh King had begged a Spanish court to be allowed to visit their five-year-old son’s bedside. But a judge ruled they must stay in custody pending a decision on their extradition back to Britain.

Lawyers and relatives say the pair are being treated like criminals for smuggling their son abroad to treat his aggressive brain tumour.

Devoted: The Kings with Ashya at Southampton hospital before they took him to Spain

Ashya’s brothers have also apparently been barred from seeing him in hospital and the family fears his health will deteriorate rapidly without their love. In another day of drama:

Ashya’s parents took him out of Southampton General Hospital last week after reaching deadlock with doctors over his treatment.

They fled to Spain where they hoped to sell their holiday home in the Costa del Sol to pay for specialist treatment in the Czech Republic.

Mr King, 51, said doctors refused his pleas to consider referring Ashya for the proton beam radiotherapy in Prague and claimed they threatened to get a court order if he interfered with his son’s medical treatment.

Arrested: Brett and Naghmeh King (pictured being pushed into a police car outside Velez Malaga police station) appeared before a Madrid court today, accused of neglecting their dying five-year-old son Ashya

On trial: A police van holding Brett and Naghemeh King, sweeps into the National Court in Madrid, Spain this morning ahead of their hearing - they were remanded in custody for a further 72 hours

Cancer sufferer: Terminally ill boy, Ashya, five, was found alive by police in Spain but is under police guard in hospital and his family are banned from seeing him

He and his wife, who have seven children, made it to Spain but were arrested and hauled before an extradition court in Madrid after British police issued a European arrest warrant.

The King family’s Spanish lawyer, Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, said: ‘The parents are so sad, they are desperate. They have been slandered and their reputation has been destroyed.

‘They are here just to help their child and to get them the best treatment possible. They didn’t abandon England.

‘They didn’t need any permission because if you are a parent you have custody. This couple love their children dearly and much of what’s been said about them is manipulations and lies.’

The lawyer said the Kings’ eldest son Danny, 23, had been allowed to see Ashya in hospital in Malaga yesterday.

But another brother Naveed, 20, said none of the family were allowed to see him and a source said all visits would be banned without permission from a judge.

The source said Ashya was under police guard and no visits had been approved.

Naveed told Channel 4 News: ‘We’re not allowed to go and see Ashya at all. There is police standing outside his hospital room. We are not allowed to go and see him.’ He said it was the first time Ashya had been alone in hospital, adding: ‘His health may deteriorate because he’s not being entertained and [kept] happy.’

Counter-argument: Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz, laywer for British couple Brett and Naghemeh King speaks to the press outside National Court in Madrid and said the couple were victims of false detention and libel

Friends of the family have organised an online petition calling on Mr Cameron to help the family. By 8pm last night more than 48,000 people had signed it. A public appeal for donations to pay for Ashya’s treatment at a private clinic in Prague had also raised more than £10,000.

The Proton Therapy Centre there said it would consider Ashya for treatment immediately if he was eligible, but it would have to be approved by his doctors in Britain or Spain.

It confirmed his father had contacted the clinic on August 20 to request the treatment for his tumour, known as a medulloblastoma. Treatment of paediatric tumours at the centre typically costs up to £65,000.

Defence: Naveed King said his parents ensured his brother Ashya had exactly the same resources available to him at hospital when they took him to Spain, including this chargeable power-chord for his feeding line

Mr King, who runs a property management company, was said to have researched the clinic online before asking doctors at Southampton General Hospital to refer Ashya there for treatment. In a video blog posted on YouTube before his arrest he said he had pleaded for the proton beam therapy but said doctors said it would not help Ashya’s type of tumour.

Mr Diaz said: ‘They will be taking legal action against the doctors who libelled him [Mr King] in the hospital and they will file a criminal complaint for false detention and libel.’ Southampton General Hospital’s medical director Dr Michael Marsh said the hospital had referred patients for proton therapy but it was not suitable for every case.

He added: ‘We very much regret the communication and relationship with the King family had broken down. Our first concern is for Ashya’s welfare.’

Mr and Mrs King are expected to appear before the Audiencia National – Spain’s central criminal court – in Madrid again on Thursday to learn if they will be extradited back to Britain. Both are Jehovah’s Witnesses but their family insists their beliefs have not influenced their actions.

British police have travelled to Spain and yesterday defended the decision to have the couple arrested. Hampshire Constabulary’s Assistant Chief Constable Chris Shead said he would rather be criticised for ‘being proactive’ than ‘potentially having to explain why a child has lost his life’.
