British Airways has been dragged into a privacy row over a scheme which uses Google to create dossiers of passenger information.

Staff at the airline are carrying 
iPads giving them instant access to customer data, including passengers’
 travel history, meal requests and details of any previous complaints.

They will also use Google Images to 
search for pictures to link with passenger profiles, helping staff to 
identify them next time they fly. British Airways says the ‘Know Me’ 
scheme will improve customer service by making it more personalised.

But Nick Pickles, director of privacy
 group Big Brother Watch, said it was wrong to hunt for passengers’ 
information on the internet without their permission.

He said: ‘Fundamentally British 
Airways have not asked their passengers’ permission to search Google to 
find their picture or any other information.

‘For them to do so without express consent may be unlawful under the Data Protection Act.’

He added: ‘This goes to show that 
major international companies now recognise the best way to find out 
personal information about its customers is to ask Google.’

Some 2,000 cabin crew have been given
 iPads to replace cumbersome rolls of paper containing passenger 
information. Around 4,500 passengers a day are expected to be given 
personal greetings by staff by the end of the year.

BA said the scheme would allow staff 
to resolve complaints more quickly and help them deal sympathetically 
with passengers who had experienced previous problems.

A spokesman said: ‘The most recent 
advancement of the system enables the British Airways team to search 
Google Images for a photo of specific customers, so they can recognise 
them as soon as they enter the airport or aircraft and proactively 
approach them.’

Staff are likely to pick out 
‘high-profile travellers’ flying first class or passengers previously 
delayed so they can ‘go the extra mile, recognise the previous issue and
 thank the customer for their continued patronage’.

BA’s head of revenue and customer analysis, Jo Boswell, said: ‘Solving problems at the point of failure is a lot more powerful than waiting until after the event. It is more powerful when customers don’t have to repeat their stories to different departments within BA.’

She said BA was trying to recreate the ‘feeling of recognition you get in a favourite restaurant when you’re welcomed there, but in our case it will be delivered by thousands of staff to millions of customers’.

Data protection watchdog the Information Commissioner’s Office said the scheme would have to comply with the law where private data must be held securely and only accessed when needed.

BA’s spokesman said: ‘We are entirely compliant with the UK Data Protection Act and would never breach that.

‘“Know Me” is simply another tool to enable us to offer good customer service, similar to the recognition that High Street loyalty scheme members expect.

‘The Google Images search app helps our customer service team to recognise high-profile travellers  such as captains of industry who would be using our first class facilities, enabling us to give a more personalised service.’
