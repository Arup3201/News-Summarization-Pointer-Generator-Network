The BBC’s Diamond Jubilee coverage misfired, one of its main presenters admitted yesterday.

Clare Balding confessed she believed the corporation’s coverage of the river pageant fell short.

And in an acknowledgement of the audience’s frustration at the ‘inane’ commentary, she said: ‘If you ever hear me say the atmosphere is wonderful, shoot me.’

Disappointed: Clare Balding has admitted she felt the BBC's coverage of the Diamond Jubilee fell short

Miss Balding is the first presenter to speak out about the coverage, which has brought more than 3,600 complaints.

She said at the Hay Festival: ‘I think (the BBC’s) aim with the pageant was to give a festival atmosphere.

‘They were worried that a camera just looking at a boat might be a bit dull. It was done with the best of intentions. There was a lot going on that was difficult to deal with.’

Miss Balding reported from  the £1million rowing boat Gloriana and said that six out of the nine cameras on the vessels were not working and bad weather caused communications problems between producers and presenters.

She suggested better preparation would have helped,  adding: ‘It is difficult to cover a big event. You have a minute to make an impact.

‘Because of my sports background I believe facts are my friend.

If you ever hear me say the atmosphere is wonderful, shoot me.’

Miss Balding did not directly criticise any  of her colleagues but viewers have hit out at Fearne Cotton, Matt Baker and Chris Hollins.

Miss Cotton interviewed war veterans during the pageant but got one man’s name wrong and viewers found her tone disrespectful.

Baker was branded ‘woeful’ for his presentation of Sunday’s pageant.

The BBC said last night it reviews all its broadcasts and the Jubilee coverage ‘will be no exception’.
