The biological parents of baby Gammy say they never struck a deal with a Thai surrogacy agency to solve the issue of their 'problem' child by allowing his birth mother to care for him.

Both Wendy and David Farnell have rejected the claim that they agreed to have Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, mother him because he had Down's syndrome and that they gave favourable treatment to Gammy's healthy twin sister, Pipah.

In an exclusive interview to air on 60 Minutes tomorrow night David Farnell says he wanted both babies born before making a decision on Baby Gammy's future: 'We never said you (Ms Pattaramon) can have this baby, no matter what.'

The couple spoke of their heartbreak at leaving Gammy behind in Thailand, despite admitting they had not sought help from authorities

An emotional David Farnell said he and wife Wendy had no choice but to leave baby Gammy back in Thailand

Mr Farnell also spoke of his past as a convicted child sex offender and said his sexual urges had '100 percent stopped' and his daughter would be safe

Critics of the couple are angry that they left Gammy behind with his surrogate mother because he had Down's syndrome

'We said we want both babies to be born and we will think about this,' he said.

Mr Farnell also denies Ms Chanbua's claims that they neglected Gammy and gave favourable treatment to Pipah.

'We bought milk for both babies, we bought nappies for both babies,' Mr Farnell says.

Mr and Mrs Farnell have spoken to 60 Minutes about the surrogacy scandal engulfing them, and are expected to detail the events surrounding the birth of their twins via a surrogate mother in Thailand earlier this year.

Both have come under intense media scrutiny since the scandal broke, and will reveal how they have been hiding inside their Western Australia home all week while reporters camped on their door step.

David and Wendy Farnell did not shower or turn on the computer to ensure no one found out that they were hidden inside.

They remained undetected on the two occasions child protection officers came to the Bunbury home to speak with the parents, news.com.au reports.

The couple have been sought by the Western Australian Department of Child Protection, who wish to assess the Farnells suitability as parents since it was revealed that David Farnell, 56, is a convicted paedophile.

The Farnells also refused to come to the door when the RSPCA took the family dog away, believing the couple had left their home and abandoned their pet. The couple say they fed their dog everyday before it was taken away on Tuesday.

It is understood the Farnells have contacted the department this week.

The Australian parents of baby Gammy left their home at midnight on Wednesday.

On Thursday night, they filmed an interview with 60 minutes, pleading with Australians to 'hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them'.

60 Minutes will make a donation to the charity Hands Across The Water, but the couple were not paid for the interview.

Hands Across The Water have already raised more than $200,000 for Gammy's treatment and care. They will support Gammy until he has completed his education.

David and Wendy Farnell, who are at the centre of the surrogacy scandal that has gripped the country, will speak to 60 Minutes this Sunday about the events surrounding the birth of their twins via a surrogate mother in Thailand earlier this year.

A preview of episode shows Mr Farnell explaining, 'We wanted to bring him with us.'

In the late 1990s, Farnell was convicted of 22 child sex offences, committed while he was in his 20s, including one against a girl who was just seven. The sentencing judge said the victims had been 'robbed of their childhood'.

Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10.

It was not until the women were adults that they made complaints and court documents said the women had suffered 'depression' and 'difficulty forming relationships' as a result of the abuse.

But the couple, who will be interviewed on 60 Minutes on Sunday, spoke through the television program to ask 'Australia to hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them.'

Meanwhile Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, declined to give an interview with the program, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'I don't want money from them,' she said.

'I don't need their help.'

The couple's interview will come just days after one of Mr Farnell's adult children – a son from his previous marriage – spoke out in defence of his father, saying that the family had not been able to tell their side of the story for legal reasons.

Also on Thursday, the son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, telling the Sydney Morning Herald that it was 'heartbreaking' his father's dark past was being revisited.

'He's taken 10 years to get his life back on track and he did and he has done so well and this, this has been shattering,' the unnamed son was quoted as saying.

Ms Pattaramon claims the Farnells, from Bunbury in Western Australia, did not want seven-month-old baby Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome and took only his twin sister.

The Farnells initially claimed their daughter, whom they admitted was the same age as Gammy and had been born through a Thai surrogate, did not have a twin brother.

They later said they had known about the twin, but were told he only had a day to live and should say their goodbyes to the baby before they left the country, due to civil unrest.

Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, says the Farnells did not want Gammy and told her to have an abortion, when they discovered he had Down syndrome

Chanbua smothered him with kisses while he was in hospital getting treatment for a lung infection

The couple also wanted to make it known that they have been cooperating with the Department of Child Protection since Wednesday morning and will continue to cooperate with them.

They also wanted it to be known that they had been feeding their dog every day until the RSPCA took her away on Wednesday morning.

Officers from the Department of Child Protection were seen visiting the Farnells' South Bunbury home on Wednesday. The Farnells wanted to make it known that they had been cooperating with the DoCP since that time
