Twelve months ago he played what he described as ‘brain dead’ golf at The Open at Muirfield and flew out of Scotland in a suitable daze.

‘That was the first time I had missed out on playing at the weekend at an Open. It really did hurt,’ said Rory McIlroy.

This time he returns, not only as one of the favourites but with a links game to back up his status. Always assuming he doesn’t suffer one of those freaky Fridays, of course.

Focus: Rory McIlroy is looking to get over his Friday woes and go for glory at The Open this week

Shocker: The Northern Irishman endured a nightmare round this time last year

‘Ah, the elephant in the room,’ he 
said when the delicate question of what the heck happens to him  during 
second rounds crops up. So far this year, McIlroy is a combined 51 under
 par for first rounds — and a startling nine over for the  following 
day.

‘It’s almost at the 
point where I am hoping for an average first day so I can go out 
thinking I can improve on it,’ said the 25-year-old.

‘Friday
 on my mind...’ goes the old song by the Easybeats and McIlroy was 
honest enough to admit that’s the problem in his case. ‘I definitely 
think it’s got into my head and I have made it a much bigger thing than 
it is,’ he said. ‘Maybe I’ve been putting a bit too much pressure on 
myself going out on Fridays and trying to back up a good score on day 
one.

‘If I have no problem shooting a low one on Thursday then there shouldn’t be any problem doing so the following day.

‘This
 week I’ve just got to go out and get a solid start to my second round 
under my belt. Hopefully, this is the week when I start to turn this 
Friday thing around.’

McIlroy’s
 sole victory so far this year also came in England at the European 
Tour’s flagship event at Wentworth in May. But for a series of poor 
scores on Fridays a good year to this point would surely be seen in a 
brighter light already. McIlroy has shot three 63s and one 64 in opening
 rounds — and did not go on to win any of those events.

Looking up: The Northern Irishman is hoping to improve at Hoylake this week for The Open

Preparation: McIlroy practices his putting at Hoylake ahead of The Open this week

THIS YEAR’S COMBINED TOTALS

THURSDAY     51 under

Friday     9 over

SATURDAY/SUNDAY    61 under

His
 only top-10 Open finish came at St Andrews in 2010. Given his recent 
woes in the event and his second-round malaise, McIlroy will surely have
 been buoyed by the changing weather forecast. He is out early in the 
first round and late on Friday, and the weather was supposed to turn 
horrid on the second afternoon. Now the predictions are more benign.

What
 happened a year ago will surely act as a spur. In the midst of a 
well-publicised slump, McIlroy shot poor rounds of 79 and 75 and came 
into the media area looking and sounding like a man who feared he would 
never play well again.

‘Chalk and cheese,’ is how he describes now and then.

‘I
 feel like I am going into this championship well prepared. I’m playing 
well and I got four rounds on a good links course under my belt last 
week.’

McIlroy, who had 
rounds of 64, 67 and 68 at Royal Aberdeen alongside his Friday blip of 
78, will surely like the fact that Hoylake is unlikely to play like a 
typical Open venue.

The 
winning score will be low if the wind does not blow unexpectedly and 
no-one puts together more scores in the mid-60s than Rory. Trouble is, 
no-one of his ilk has more scores in the high 70s as well.

Hoylake
 has crowned one  Northern Irish champion already in Fred Daly in 1947, 
and McIlroy, given the player within, is certainly overdue a run at a 
major.

‘This is the oldest 
one with the richest history and I’m like everybody else, I want my name
 on the Claret Jug one day,’ he said.

‘If
 I was to win my third major here I would be three-quarters of the way 
to a career Grand Slam, and not many golfers have done that.

‘It would be special and a huge moment in my career.’

Time
 and again this year, he has been three-quarters of the way to a good 
72-hole score. If he can address that Friday madness he can certainly 
get three-quarters of the way to his Slam.
