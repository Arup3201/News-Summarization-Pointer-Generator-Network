While most children enjoy nothing more than playing outside on a warm summer's day, seven-year-old Sarah Larimore dreads it - because she cannot sweat.

After just minutes in the sun in her native South Carolina, the young girl becomes over-heated and dizzy, and must instead be confined indoors, where she takes 33 daily medications for her condition.

Her parents have spoken about the everyday struggles of her illness as Thursday marks Rare Disease Day, which was established by the National Organization for Rare Disorders in 2009.

Sarah suffers from a rare genetic disorder called cystinosis, which prevents her from sweating and causes other problems, such as kidney failure, rickets, muscle wasting and stunted growth.

Rare condition: Sarah Larimore, seven, suffers from a disease that means her body is unable to sweat

As her parents battle to make her life easier, they have come up with one remedy for the summer's sun, and built a swimming pool in their backyard last summer.

'It was her first real, live outside summer,' her mother, Katie Larimore, told ABC News. 'She just stayed in the water for three months.'

But many other parts of her day are not so easy; she takes 33 pills, one injection of growth hormone, 14 eye drops to prevent blindness and seven meals through a feeding tube in her stomach.

Cystagon, a medication she takes six times a day, including in the middle of the night, makes her breath stink, and the smell even seeps through her pores, her mother said.

By the time she is a teenager, she will 
need 80 pills every day, and she will also require a kidney transplant 
by the time she is 15.

Struggle: Every day as she battles cystinosis, Sarah must take 33 pills, one injection of growth hormone and eye drops and she eats seven meals through a feeding tube in her stomach

Support: Her father, Jeff Larimore, is the president of Cystinosis Research Network, which helps families with children with the condition

Her illness also means she rarely manages a whole week at school, but her parents told the Columbia Star that the support of Sarah's teachers has been phenomenal.

Her teacher even suggested they speak to the class about Sarah's condition, Mrs Larimore said.

Sarah suffers from Cystinosis, a rare genetic metabolic disorder. It causes an amino acid, cystine, to accumulate in every cell of the body, 
damaging organs and blood cells.

Because of this defect in transportation
of the amino acid, the cell crystallizes and causes early cell death. 
Cystinosis slowly destroys the organs in the body including the kidneys,
liver, eyes, muscles and the brain.

Common symptoms include kidney failure, mineral depletion, small 
stature, rickets, malnourishment, frequent urination, muscle wasting, and
cysteine crystals in the corneas.

It is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, which means that both parents are carriers of the gene that leads to this condition.

The parents do not exhibit any of the symptoms and the odds are that one-in-four of their children will have cystinosis. Sarah is the only one out of four siblings with the condition.

She is one of 500 Americans with the condition, according to the 
Cystinosis Research Network. An estimated 2,000 people suffer from 
the illness worldwide.

She is also one of at least 25 million Americans who suffer from rare conditions, according to the National Institutes of Health.

'[The children] thought Sarah was a hero
to be able to swallow 33 pills a day,' she said. 'And now, they look 
out for her, they baby her, and they have embraced her because of the 
difference.

'It was an excellent 
call from an excellent teacher.'

Sarah also catches up with school work during summer recesses, as she is unable to go outside in the South Carolina sun without becoming ill.

The reason she is unable to sweat is just 'one of those mysteries of cystinosis', her mother said.

She was diagnosed with the condition at 15 months old.

Her parents, who have three older children, knew something was wrong when she stopped growing and needed to drink two gallons of water every day, and they sought out professional help.

'Being she was my fourth, I knew 
something was wrong,' Mrs Larimore told ABC. 'Sarah was very, very tiny at
this point because she had stopped growing. I went from doctor to 
doctor until I found one that believed me.'

They came across one doctor who was treating another patient with the same condition, and Sarah was diagnosed with infantile nephropathic cystinosis, the most severe 
form.

'Her prognosis is unknown,' Mrs Larimore told the Columbia Star. 'Technically, 
cystinosis is considered terminal because there is no cure. Jeff and I 
don't like to think that way. So, we just go with the idea that thereâ€™s 
no expiration date stamped on her anywhere.'

Each month the family spends around 
$5,000 on medication, doctors' visits and supplies, most of which is 
currently covered by insurance.

Taking it in her stride: Sarah told her classmates about her condition during a presentation at school and now they all rally around her to help, her parents said

But they are also battling for new medication for their daughter which will make her life easier.

A company is expected to get FDA 
approval for a new drug over the next few months that could replace Cystagon, and which would last for 12 hours instead of six, her parents said.

The family also went to Washington D.C. last month to speak with their representatives in Congress and ask them not to cut funding to research programs as sequester budget cuts loom.

Among their requests, they argued to keep funding for the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which gives pharmaceutical companies tax incentives and other help so that they research rare illnesses.

They also argued for a Medicare policy known as TEFRA, in which middle-class families in 26 states get federal dollars to help pay for the costs of caring for a child with serious illnesses.
