A high school student from Georgia was suspended after posting a mugshot of his principal on Instagram and then incorrectly stating the crime that she had been arrested for.

Keandre Varner, a senior at Riverdale High School near Atlanta, posted the picture of Jamille Miller-Brown on his Instagram page.

He commented that he thought she had been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Suspended: Keandre Varner was suspended weeks before his graduation after he posted his principal's mugshot on Instagram

Arrested: Principal Jamille Miller-Brown was arrested for missing a court date over a speeding ticket, not for DUI

Ms. Miller-Brown had indeed been arrested in March after missing a court date, but it was for a speeding ticket rather than DUI.

School officials then decided to hand out some punishments of their own and suspended Varner for two days, just weeks before his final exams.

The school said the suspension was given because Keandre was disruptive in school and began showing the picture to fellow students. He was also rude to the principal when she confronted him.

Keandre's mother, Nakesha Thomas, told WSBTV.com her son never showed the mugshot to other students. She explained the letter the principal wrote stated that the suspension was imposed for 'passing around misinformation.'

Riverdale High School: Other students at the school were told they risked being suspended if they were found to have the photo on their phones

The student said he put the mugshot on his Instagram page. When one of his followers asked why she was arrested, he commented, 'I think because of a DUI.'

Principal Miller-Brown found out and called him into her office.

She asked him about the comments whereupon Varner was informed of his mistake and he was suspended.

'I didn't like, really didn't intend to defame her character,' Varner said.

Other students were also told they risked facing suspension if they continued to have the mugshot in their phones.
