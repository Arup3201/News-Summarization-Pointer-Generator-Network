Scott Walker's children plan to skip college next fall to talk about their dad with New Hampshire voters, but the Wisconsin governor has stopped short of formally saying he is running for president.

So, too, has former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He carefully avoided declaring himself a candidate for the Republican nomination even though his two-day visit to this early nominating state had all of the marks of a White House bid.

Welcome to cagey and often absurd early stages of this campaign for president.

Walker delivered remarks on Saturday, in which he called for more state and local control over education - as well as a stronger U.S. foreign policy.

Changes: In his speech, Walker called for more state and local control over education

Walker, Bush, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas all are afoot in New Hampshire this weekend, meeting with party activists and elders. And each, like the others who have been or soon will be coming, are taking great pains to avoid stating the obvious and triggering the headaches that come with being a full-blown candidate.

But there are plenty of slips along the way, such as when Walker disclosed Saturday that his 19- and 20-year-old sons plan to ditch college this fall.

'They twisted our arms to figure out a way to maybe take part of a semester off next year, next fall, to come to New Hampshire, to come around the country and talk to young people like themselves,' Walker said.

Walker also promised he would return to New Hampshire often, even though he was circumspect on why the governor of a Midwestern state would take such a shine to New Hampshire if he weren't running for the GOP nomination.

'We'll be back many more times to New Hampshire,' he promised.

Not waiting for Walker to make official his candidacy, union members rallied outside the political event. Walker as governor has dramatically rolled back union rights in his state and labor groups are already running their own campaign against his bid.

A similar wink and nod came from Bush, who drew a large number of out-of-state reporters to his meetings with business leaders in southern New Hampshire on Friday.

Walker made his appearance in New Hampshire, a launching pad for presidential election campaigns because its primary is the first in the country, a week after signing a so-called 'right-to-work' bill. The law prevents labor unions in Wisconsin from forcing workers to pay dues, but opponents contend its underlying goal is to undermine organized labor.

Walker has embraced the issue of limiting the power of unions as his signature cause, making him the target of a failed recall campaign three years ago.

Before Walker’s speech at Concord High School, union members protested outside, holding signs that said, 'Stop the war on workers,' and 'Scott Walker: stop trashing the middle class.'

Speaking in a full auditorium, Walker said he would not be cowed by those who disagreed with him.

'They seek to intimidate,' Walker said. 'But we never lost focus. We did what we had to do, and that’s what’s needed in America today.'

The 'right-to-work' issue has been contentious in New Hampshire. Legislators have sponsored several bills to make union membership optional, but the legislation failed to clear both chambers and would have faced certain vetoes by Democratic governors.

In his speech, Walker called for more state and local control over education, a position that distinguished him from Bush, who has backed the controversial Common Core national standards.

Walker also called for a stronger U.S. foreign policy, calling 'radical Islamic terrorism' the greatest security threat facing the United States.

Walker was quoted by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as saying 'We need a president who will do whatever it takes, whatever it takes. Who understands we have an ally in Israel and we should start acting like it. Who understands that radical Islamic terrorism is like a virus and if you don't take it out entirely, it's like a virus in your computer that will keep coming back.'

The Republican governor also reportedly said at the event that he was wearing a $1 Kohl's sweater and also described a teenage job at McDonald's.

Walker, the Journal Sentinel reported, 'earned an enthusiastic response from the crowd in Concord.' 

Walker also took aim at Democratic President Barack Obama and polices he said measured success based on how many people were dependent on the government.

'We should measure success on just the opposite, on how many are not dependent on the government,' Walker said.

Maurice Tandy, 81, a resident of the nearby town of Franklin, said Walker’s message resonated with him. 'He wants to bring government closer to the people, back to the towns and cities.' 

Jennifer Horn, the New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman, told the Boston Herald 'It was a great day for the Republican Party, no question about it. We had 400 grass-roots activists together, energized, excited. Obviously, Gov. Walker was very well-received.'

Ex-New Hampshire state senator and Walker supporter Jim Luther told WKOW 'He just comes across as a very straightforward guy and I think he has a very unique voice to speak to the center.'

The television station reported that the majority of people present haven't picked a GOP primary candidate to back yet. 

TIME reported that Walker also dismissed the the idea he's a 'flip-flopper' on issues Saturday, saying the term is 'Just a narrative from the other campaigns that are frustrated with the fact that we've got a strong reputation of keeping our word.'

According to the news outlet, Walker did acknowledge changing his immigration views.

Meanwhile, Bush said 'I have brought all my friends from outside of New Hampshire to come do their part to enhance the economic climate of Nashua.' 

And when asked how he, as president, would confront Islamic State militants, Bush made a point of saying he was not yet a candidate for the office.

'I get really nervous about not triggering a campaign with all of these people around,' Bush said.

Each of the likely candidates is coached to couch their ambitions in hypotheticals. Walker's 'not being a declared candidate' caveat and Bush's 'I'm considering the possibility of running' statements are merely formalities at this point. Several candidates are likely to start taking the next steps in April, and most have been laying the groundwork for a campaign for months if not years.

For instance, Walker was tardy for a state party training session Saturday morning because he was held up in private meetings with those he hopes will back his campaign in waiting. On his dance card on this trip: former Gov. John H. Sununu, former Sen. Scott Brown, Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas, state Senate President Chuck Morse and county party chairs.

'There are so many people hoping to get a few minutes with the governor,' New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn told waiting activists on Saturday.

When he eventually arrived to a warm reception, Horn introduced him: 'We're so grateful he's made time for us.'
