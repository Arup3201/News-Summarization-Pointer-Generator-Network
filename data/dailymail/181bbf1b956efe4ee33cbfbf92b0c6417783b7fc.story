An seriously-ill baby girl has been found alone wet and shaking on a tiny boat in the waters off Spain's south coast.

The infant, who has been given the name of Princesa – Spanish for ‘princess’ by Red Cross workers - was found in one of the 94 inflatable boats that reached the Spanish coast earlier this week from Morocco.

The child, thought to be eight or 10 months old, was found wrapped in blankets with a 38.5C temperature.

The boat in which Princesa was found had departed from Morocco before being intercepted en route to Tarifa, Spain's southernmost port, local media reported. 

According to other rescued African immigrants, an altercation with Moroccan police officers before the tiny boat's departure prevented the parents boarding the craft, reported The Local. 

After she was found, the infant was taken to the Red Cross's Tarifa branch and volunteers took turns throughout the night to look after her.

She eventually took two bottles.  

The government of the Spanish region of Andalucia has taken custody of Princesa and is now hoping her parents will contact them.

Until then it is thought the she will be transferred to a refugee centre.  

Today hundreds of sub-Saharan migrants tried to scale six-metre (20-foot) barbed-wire fences to enter Spain's northwest African enclave city of Melilla from Morocco for the third day in a row.

 The Interior Ministry said 250 migrants made the attempt early Thursday but only one got across and avoided police interception.

Groups of some 700 migrants stormed the fence Tuesday and Wednesday with dozens of them staying atop the fence for several hours before police persuaded them to climb down and return to Morocco.
