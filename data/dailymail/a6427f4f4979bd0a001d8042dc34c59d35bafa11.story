Two men have been arrested for soliciting two teenaged sisters for sex outside a grocery store after police say the girls told their father of the disturbing offer and they set up a sting operation.

Police in Orem say the two sisters, aged 14 and 16, were walking through a Macey's parking lot on Wednesday afternoon when Alexander Navidad-Hernandez drove up asking if they wanted any money.

The 27-year-old man allegedly then handed the girls a five-dollar bill with a phone number scribbled across it.

He said, "Call me if you need more money," the 14-year-old recalled to KUTV.

'It scared me a lot,' she said. 'My heart was hurting at first and I was shocked.'

Once safely home the girls told their father what happened.

Furious, and hoping to capture the man behind the horrific approach, he asked his eldest daughter to call the number back and ask what his exact intentions were.

When the man answered, he told her. He wanted sex, the girl claims, but when she suggested a fee of $100 he said it was too high, as well as her second offer of $50.

She says he offered her $30.

'I honestly think itâ€™s disgusting that an older guy finds a 14-year-old girl attractive in any way,' the eldest daughter said.

The girls' father immediately contacted 
the Orem police department who helped stage a sting operation with the 
youngest girl calling back the man and telling him that she was indeed 
interested.

The girls planned to meet him at Orem Junior High School with Navidad-Hernandez allegedly saying he wanted to bring a friend along so the girls could make some extra money.

That second man was later identified as 36-year-old Javier Santos-Jacobo.

When the girls arrived, with police ready and watching nearby, so did the two suspects who pulled up and parked in the junior high school's parking lot.

'When you have two men show up in a car 
that they say they are going to show up in, and they sit in the parking 
lot, and they are the only one there, we knew we had our guys,' Orem 
police Lt. Craig Martinez told KUTV.

Navidad-Hernandez and Santos-Jacobo were booked into the Utah County Jail on charges of Enticing a Minor and Sexual Solicitation.

Despite the otherwise safe ending, the incident has left the girls understandably rattled and fearful that there may be other predators on the loose nearby.

'All these sick people need to get out of here. There are so many little girls around here without a parent and some guy can say, "here's some money,"' the 14-year-old said.
