Five rare monkeys worth thousands of pounds have been stolen from a zoo by thieves who deal in 'prestige pets' on the black market, it has been claimed.

Thieves stole the tamarin monkeys - three of which are endangered species - from two separate monkey enclosures during a 'planned a premeditated' late-night raid in Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire.

One of the stolen monkeys was carrying a three-month old baby, while concerns have been raised that the baby monkey who was snatched will die if separated from its mother.

Five monkeys have been stolen from Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire in a late-night raid. The five monkeys included this baby cotton-top tamarin, pictured, and two female cotton-top tamarins, one pictured, which are critically-endangered species

One of the stolen female cotton-top tamarins, which were born in primate at the zoo, was pregnant and could be in a particularly vulnerable state

Staff at the zoo have warned that the monkeys, all born in captivity at the zoo, need extremely specialist care to survive.

Charlotte 
Pennie, head of the primate enclosure at the zoo said: 'We are very 
concerned about where the animals are because if they're not looked 
after properly they will get ill and die.

'If the baby is taken away from its mother it will not be able to cope and it will die.

'Primates
 do not make good pets. They have to have a large area, they have 
special requirements and special diets, they live in large groups, they 
don't deal with stress very well.'

The stolen animals - said to be worth thousands on the black market - include two female cotton-top tamarins, aged 12 years and 18 months, and one baby cotton-top tamarin.

The cotton-top tamarin is one of the most critically-endangered primates, with only 6,000 in the wild. It is also one of the smallest primates on earth.

The monkeys, which included this emperor tamarin, are said to need specialist care in order to survive. Wildlife experts and the zoo staff are concerned for their welfare

It is feared the stolen animals, including this emperor tamarin, could be sold on the black market for thousands to those who want 'prestige pets'

Two male emperor tamarins, aged five months and 7 years - said to be popular with the zoo's guests due to their trademark white moustache - were also taken.

Experts 
say small monkeys such as tamarins and macaques are becoming an 
increasingly popular pet in America, despite a ban by several states 
on owning a primate.

There are fears the stolen animals will now be taken out of Britain to be sold on 
the black market as 'pets' for wealthy buyers.

But experts say that these monkeys, who have extremely 'sensitive systems', can die shortly after being bought due to being in the wrong, more stressful environment.

Lancashire police is 
now working with the National Wildlife Crime Unit to track down the stolen animals and have issued an alert on all ports.

Police
 believe the animals were targeted specifically and have circulated 
their details to all ports and airports in case the thieves try to take 
them abroad.

The
 thefts took place when raiders cut a hole in a perimeter fence at the 
zoo, overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

It is thought zookeepers spotted the theft when they opened up for business on Wednesday.

Ms Pennie added: 'I have 
worked here for 12 years and the majority of the animals who were taken 
last night have been born while I have been here.

'It's
 absolutely devastating for us. They are invaluable to the zoo as they are
 part of a breeding group.

The cotton-top tamarin is one of the most critically-endangered - and smallest - primates in the world.

The species was listed in the 'The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates' between 2008 and 2012.

The wild population is estimated at around 6,000.

The species is found in tropical forests in northwestern Colombia. Its diet 
includes insects and plant extracts.

It is thought that, historically, up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research.

But in 1976, they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned.

But
 the species is still at risk, because their natural habitat is being destRoyed.

The lowland forest in Colombia has been reduced to five percent of its previous area.

The cotton-top tamarin is easily spotted by the long white crest reaching from its forehead to its shoulders.

The emperor tamarin is native to the Amazon rainforest.

Its name is derived from its imperial-looking long white moustache.

'Now vital members of the breeding group 
have been taken so we can no longer breed the animals, which is terrifying 
as they are both endangered species.'

'The emperors are really popular in the zoo because they have a big white moustache.

'Visitors come and see them and comment on their moustache and make references to Movember.

'The monkeys are loved by visitors of all ages. They come right up to the window and they can be very active.'

She added that the mood at the zoo had been very different since the raid.

She said: 'They
 live in family groups and they protect each other. Today the behaviour 
of the animals is not normal because adults have been taken. The rest of
 the group seem quiet and subdued.

'They
 would have been very scared last night. I would be surprised if the 
male didn't try to attack the people who came in and took the other 
animals.'

Zoo director Darren Webster
 said: 'We are extremely saddened by the theft of these monkeys. It is 
imperative they receive the correct care in order to survive.

'All
 the animals were born here at Blackpool Zoo and are part of our zoo 
family, so I would like to urge anyone with any information to contact 
the police.'

PC
 Steve Higgs said: 'It would appear from the way that these thieves have
 broken into the zoo that this was a planned and premeditated crime.'

'The offenders knew what they were looking for and knew that the monkeys would be in the enclosures.

'I would appeal for anyone who has any information or any witnesses who saw anything suspicious on Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning to get in touch.

'It may be that there were dog walkers around at that time who may have seen people acting suspiciously.

'I would also appeal to anyone who may be offered these animals for sale to contact the police.'

Andy McWilliam, investigations officer at the National Wildlife Crime Unit, added: 'There is definitely a market for these monkeys. We are making enquires across Europe in a bid to try and trace them.'

Last year, Justin Bieber famously acquired a Capuchin named OG Mally.

But the singer left the 
pet in Germany after it was seized for not having the proper 
vetting documents.

He also left a $8000 dollar vets bill for caring for the monkey.
