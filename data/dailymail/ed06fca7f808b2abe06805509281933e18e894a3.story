Hundreds of reptiles have been discovered hidden in cigarette packets, hollowed out children's books and luggage after four men allegedly tried to smuggle them out of Australia.

Skinks, geckos, frogs, pygmy pythons, and a dead death adder - one of the most venomous snakes in the world - were found in the staggering haul.

A number of invertebrates and 33 dead reptiles, which appear to have been tagged for use as specimens, were also discovered amongst more than 157 reptiles and amphibians being transported out of Western Australia.

Four men were arrested and charged - two from Russia and two from the Czech Republic - at Perth International Airport on February 6 after an investigation by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the WA Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Reptiles were found in packages posted from Carnarvon, Tom Price, Geraldton and Perth to European destinations and two of the men also allegedly had reptiles hidden in their luggage at the airport.

All of the men face charges under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950.

ACBPS WA Investigations, Compliance and Enforcement Manager, Vesna Watt, said: 'These arrests should serve as a warning to those looking to illegally exploit Australia's natural fauna.'

'Customs and Border Protection takes these matters seriously and those caught could face up to 10 years in prison.'

During a separate Parks and Wildlife operation on 5 February, a total of 92 reptiles were found at Broome, Derby and NSW post offices and in a car intercepted in Broome by WA Police.

Some of the creatures were tagged as specimens and transported in plastic bags. Four men were arrested and charged  at Perth International Airport on February 6

A male from Western Australia and two NSW-based males, including a minor, could face more than 90 charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act.

Senior wildlife officer Rick Dawson said the two incidents represented a major breakthrough in the detection of reptile trafficking in WA history.

'Together, more than 240 native species have been prevented from leaving the State in the space of a week,' Mr Dawson said.

'Posting animals in packages and secreting them in luggage is not only illegal but cruel and inhumane - more than 20 of the reptiles were either dead by the time these parcels were intercepted, or have since died.

'The cooperative effort by agencies to conduct these operations and protect native wildlife is outstanding.'

Mr Dawson said among the animals seized from the operations were several species of reptiles listed as Specially Protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act.

'Our aim is to always release rescued animals back into the wild, if possible,' he said.

People with information about the illegal removal of native animals or who notice any suspicious activity suggesting that animals are being illegally removed should call Parks and Wildlife's Wildcare Helpline 9474 9055, Customs Watch on 1800 061 800, the police, or Wildlife Trade Compliance on 02 6274 1900.
