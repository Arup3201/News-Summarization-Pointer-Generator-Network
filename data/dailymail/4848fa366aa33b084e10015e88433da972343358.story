Great Britain's Olympic champion Dani King has admitted she feared for her career after the crash earlier this month which left her in intensive care.

The 24-year-old suffered five broken ribs and a collapsed lung after becoming involved in a pile-up on a training run in south Wales.

'There were loads of things running through my mind, like I would never ride again,' she told BBC Radio Solent.

'I could feel my ribs moving and was scared. I was in the road for an hour, it was raining. I lost feeling in my feet, which worried me.'

King spent two days in intensive care and 10 altogether in hospital, but was doing fitness work even then and hopes to soon return to riding in some form.

'In hospital I did three gym sessions - and that was with a chest drain in,' she said. 'A lot of people called me crazy, but that was just my way of dealing with it.

'I'm hoping to be on a static bike next week, but I won't be on the road for a few weeks - but I definitely will be back on a bike.'

King was part of the British trio, along with Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell, who won gold in the team pursuit in world record time at London 2012.
