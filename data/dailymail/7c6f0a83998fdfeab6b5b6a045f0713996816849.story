Ed Miliband last night declared ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’ as a catastrophic poll showed he has crashed to the worst personal rating of any leader since records began.

On the eve of a make-or-break speech seeking to draw a line under his most turbulent period since beating brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, he conceded his ‘mettle has been tested’ by ‘a difficult couple of weeks’. 

With six months until the general election, the IpsosMori survey shows just 13 per cent of people now think he is ready to run the country, with the Tories now three points ahead – the biggest lead for four years.

Ed Miliband's net satisfaction ratings have slumped 10 points to -44, the worst for any main party leader six months before a general election, according to IpsosMORI data dating back to the 1970s

Mr Miliband's leadership has been rocked by growing discontent in the Labour party, with 'depressed' MPs and frontbenchers fearing he is leading them to defeat.

Just 21 per cent of people are now satisfied with his performance as leader, with an extraordinary 65 per cent dissatisfied, according to the IpsosMORI survey for the Standard.

It means his net rating is -44 per cent, down 10 points in month and eight points lower than Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.

Analysis of 40 years of party leaders' ratings six months before general elections shows no leader has ever been more unpopular at this stage of the electoral cycle.

Mr Foot, who secured just 28 per cent of the vote against Margaret Thatcher's Tories in 1983, had net satisfaction of -38 per cent at this stage.

It means Mr Miliband is now considered less impressive than Gordon Brown, Michael Howard, Neil Kinnock and Jim Callaghan before they all led their parties to defeat.

Last night Mr Miliband said: ‘This job is a tough job and it should be a tough job. It’s an audition to be prime minister.

‘They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger and that’s true and, you know, my mettle has been tested but people want a prime minister, want a leader of the Labour Party, who can come through tough times and will fight for them and that’s who I am,' he told the BBC.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage hinted he could do a deal with Labour

Ukip could enter coalition with Labour if Ed Miliband falls short of a majority, Nigel Farage has admitted. 

Polls suggest another hung parliament is increasingly likely. 

Mr Farage told the New Statesman: 'I'd do a deal with the Devil if he got me what I wanted.' 

Asked if he would agree to join a coalition with Labour in exchange for an in-out referendum on Britain leaving the EU, he added 

'That would depend when the referendum was, and the terms.' 

Pressed on whether he was ruling it out, Mr Farage said: 'Of course not.' 

David Cameron, meanwhile, is on -15 per cent, with 38 per cent satisfied with his performance.

Some 32 per cent of people now say they are going to vote for the Conservatives, three points ahead of Labour on 29 per cent – the same level of support secured by Mr Brown in Labour's defeat in 2010.

Just 23 per cent of voters think Labour is ready to form the next government, down from 35 per cent in June this year. Almost two thirds (61 per cent) disagreed.

Bobby Duffy, Managing Director at Ipsos MORI said: 'The interviewing for this poll was conducted at the height of the very public discussion of a possible challenge to Ed Miliband's leadership of the party – and it looks like it's had a significant effect on public opinion. 

'The Labour leadership will clearly hope that this marks a low point - they've lost the lead to the Conservatives in overall voting intention, but they're still within touching distance, despite all the negative coverage.'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the polls had been 'bouncing about'.

'We've had polls which have put Labour three and four points ahead,' he told BBC News. 'The only poll which matters is the general election day. Of course that's a cliche, but it's true.

'Our party is determined - from Ed Miliband, right down, throughout all our shadow cabinet and MPs - to get out there and say we'll have reform in Europe but we won't play fast and loose with jobs and investment like David Cameron, we'll have tough and fair immigration controls but we won't walk away from international markets like Ukip and the Tories, that we will have action on banking reform but also a bank bonus tax.

'We've got the policies. I think with Ed Miliband's leadership we can persuade the British people in the coming months that we've got the plan to make our economy strong and secure for the future. That's what we've got to do and that's what we'll do every day until polling day.' 

Sunday's newspapers were dominated by headlines about concern at the highest levels of the Labour party that Mr Miliband's poor personal ratings could cost the party victory next year.

Tony Blair yesterday insisted it was not his job to save the Labour party as he gave lukewarm support to Ed Miliband's beleaguered leadership.

The former prime minister was repeatedly pressed on live TV about the crisis in the Labour party, insisting it was 'not a topic for me' and only eventually conceding Mr Miliband has his 'full support'.

And after Mr Miliband's week of dire headlines and warnings many want him to quit, Mr Blair told him bluntly: 'That's what leadership is about.'

David Cameron has opened up the biggest Tory lead in the polls since October 2010, with his net satisfaction ratings at -15

Tomorrow Mr Miliband is expected to give a make or break speech to shore up his troubled leadership.

Addressing Labour activists in central London, he is expected to set out his the principles he would take into Downing Street.

The theme of the speech could be summed up as 'here I stand', an aide told the Telegraph.

He will promise that he will will not 'leave decency at the door of Downing Street'. 

But while many Labour MPs insist they do not doubt his principles, they are despairing about his dire personal ratings and fear it is costing them support - and seats.

Alan Johnson this week explicitly ruled out replacing Mr Miliband as Labour leader, saying he would 'never' take the job.

The popular former home secretary threw Mr Miliband a lifeline by warning rebel MPs that he will not step in if the beleaguered leader is ousted.

It comes after claims up to one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbenchers was ready to call on him to go, with Mr Johnson favourite as a caretaker leader.
