This is the shabby seaside flat where a British businessmen murdered in China conducted an affair with the woman who is chief suspect in his death, it is claimed.

Neil Heywood is said to have shared the £250,000 top-floor terrace apartment near the Bournemouth seafront with Gu Kailai, the wife of one of China's communist party leaders.

Mrs Gu has been named as chief suspect in the Old Harrovian's death in a hotel room in Chongqing last November.

Mr Heywood was even spotted pinching her bottom as they walked up stairs, it was claimed.

Modest: Keystone House where Gu Kailai owned a flat and Neil Heywood is believed to have stayed as with her

Her playboy son Bo Guagua, now 24, is believed to have also occasionally stayed at Keystone House, which was listed as Mrs Gu’s address by Company House.

She first came to Britain in 2001 to set up a business in nearby Poole while her husband rose the ranks within China’s Politburo, which has been badly tainted by the scandal.

She also sent her son to Papplewick prep school, near Ascot, Berkshire and later Harrow and Oxford University.

Wang Kang, a Chongqing scholar with contacts inside Mr Bo's circle, told The Times that there was a ‘definite’ romantic attachment between Mr Heywood and Mrs Gu.

He alleged that Mrs Gu, a lawyer, was denied ‘any normal passion’ from her husband, who also wanted to set aside her career ambitions.

An early theory put forward into Mr Heywood's death suggested he was killed after Mr Bo found out about the affair.

Mr Heywood, who had known the Bo family 
for more than a decade, was said to have confided in a friend about the 
alleged affair with Mrs Gu, saying it had ‘left his life under threat’.

Regarding their apparent love nest in Bournemouth, another source told the newspaper: ‘He stayed in the first room on the right.

‘Most mornings he was lean out of the window having a fag. She was always in the kitchen’

The claims come amid increasing rumours on Chinese websites that the pair were having an affair.

It is said that Mr Heywood later called off the relationship for unknown reasons. Some sources suggest that Mrs Gu was becoming increasingly paranoid.

And now it has been claimed that Mr Heywood was poisoned after threatening to expose a plan by Mrs Gu to move money abroad.

It was the first time a specific motive has been revealed for Neil Heywood's murder last November, a death which ended Chinese leader Bo Xilai's hopes of emerging as a top central leader and threw off balance the Communist Party's looming leadership succession.

Mrs Gu asked Heywood late last year to move a large sum of money abroad, and she became outraged when he demanded a larger cut of the money than she had expected due to the size of the transaction, two sources with knowledge of the investigation said.

whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr

Allegations last week claimed that Mr Heywood had hidden details of Bo Xilai's financial dealings with his lawyers in Britain

The claims tie up with allegations 
last week that Mr Heywood had hidden details of Bo Xilai's financial 
dealings with his lawyers in Britain.

The murder has provoked a scandal in both China, where Mr Bo had been a likely successor to the presidency, and Britain.

David Cameron has criticised spies’ failure to warn that one of China’s most powerful politicians was linked to the murder.

The Secret Intelligence Service took three months to brief William Hague on the close links between the Mr Heywood and Mr Bo.

Within that time, the Foreign Secretary’s own staff learnt that the death was suspicious but still waited three weeks before passing this onto him.

The Mail has learned that Mr Cameron’s aides have demanded answers from both MI6 officers and Foreign Office officials about how the Government was blindsided by Mr Heywood’s death last November.

Chinese officials are investigating whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr Bo and his wife Gu Kailai.

Mr Bo has now been ousted from his powerful position as the Communist Party boss of Chongqing as a power struggle rages at the top of the Politburo in Beijing.

Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood 
was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but 
details of his demise are sketchy

Heywood was found dead

Mr Hague has ordered an investigation into what went wrong, telling Parliament that the Foreign Office raised the alarm in late January only after warnings from expat businessmen in China.

The delay meant that Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne met Mr Bo and posed with a panda on November 15 – the day after Mr Heywood was found dead – unaware of links between the two men.

The Prime Minister told his staff to demand answers before he met Chinese propaganda chief Li Changchun in Downing Street.

Mr Hague said Foreign Office officials were first made aware of suspicions about 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s death on January 18, two months after his death.

He was not personally briefed until 
February 7, the day after Bo Xilai’s police chief told U.S. authorities 
that Mr Heywood was poisoned.

They had previously maintained that he died after taking excessive alcohol.

Mr Heywood’s friends have said he rarely drank alcohol and questioned the official explanation.

for his lavish lifestyle and love of partying during his days as a 
student at Oxford University, is also believed to have stayed at the flat in Bournemouth

Keeping up the pressure: David Cameron meets 
China's propaganda chief Li Changchun at Downing Street, seeking 
reassurances that the probe into Mr Heywood's death would follow due 
process

British
expats in China have accused the Foreign Office of failing to push for a
full investigation into the death because of fears over crucial trade 
links between the two countries.

Internet reports claimed Mrs Gu, who 
was godmother to the Heywoods’ two young children, met Mr Heywood’s 
widow Wang Lulu in a cafe two days after his death, accompanied by two 
armed policemen.

The 
politician’s wife was said to have begged Mrs Heywood to agree to a 
swift cremation without a post-mortem examination. Mrs Heywood was 
unavailable for comment.

A 
city official in Chongqing, Xia Deliang, has been arrested and allegedly
confessed that he prepared the poison and handed it to an employee of 
Mr Bo. The internet reports were not immediately blocked by Beijing’s 
censors, which has been interpreted to mean they were officially 
sanctioned.

Mr Bo has accused his political 
enemies of ‘pouring filth’ on his family. The Boxun website has 
previously carried claims he was a womaniser who slept with more than 
100 women.

It also alleged 
he and his wife were involved in a series of murders and that Mr Bo 
accepted nearly £100million in bribes while he was party leader in 
Chongqing.

Senior
politicians are surprised that MI6 did not raise the alarm before then 
because Mr Bo, 62, was expected to be promoted to the Politburo in a 
once-a-decade shake-up of Chinese leaders this autumn.
