As an accomplished Premier League winger, Yannick Bolasie knows the importance of a good assist in getting the right result.

And the Crystal Palace winger showed he is happy to use teamwork in his personal life as well, getting his one-year-old son to help propose to his girlfriend.

Bolasie carried baby Kaidy into the room wearing a sign saying 'Mummy, will you marry Daddy?', much to the surprise of his girlfriend Kelsey.

The sign, shaped like a heart, reads 'Mummy, will you marry Daddy?', and was round Bolasie's son's neck

While the crowd of onlookers screamed an applauded, Bolasie's girlfriend appeared overcome with emotion.

Bolasie has been in excellent form for Crystal Palace this season, starting all but one of their Premier League games.

The 25-year-old played 90 minutes as Palace were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Stoke on Saturday. 

Bolasie's girlfriend looked shocked by the proposal as onlookers screamed and cheered

Bolasie later posted this picture of him down on his knees offering a ring to his girlfriend
