The Iranian Revolutionary Guard today went on to a war footing as its commander upped his troops' readiness for operations.

The move by General Mohammed Ali Jaafari, coming after the shooting down of a U.S. drone and the ransacking of the British embassy in Tehran, will raise fears among citizens in the West that the Islamists are escalating towards major conflict.

But following on from mysterious explosions at Iranian nuclear sites, the kidnapping and assassination of scientists and possible sabotage of computers using a virus, an increasing number of experts are suggesting that combat has already broken out - a '21st century war'.

Operational status: Iran's Revolutionary Guard have been put on a war footing by the country's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei over fears of an attack by the West on its nuclear facilities

The key area of dispute is Iran's rapidly expanding nuclear programme from which President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad insists he will not budge 'one iota'.

Sanctions and mounting international pressure appear to have failed to persuade the country  to slow down its pursuit of uranium enrichment.

And many observers believe the blowing-up of facilities and targeting of key scientists is a more direct way of halting their ambitions.

Patrick Clawson, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he was under no illusion as to what was occurring.

He told the Los Angeles Times: 'It looks like the 21st century form of war.

'It does appear that there is a campaign of assassinations and cyber war, as well as the semi-acknowledged campaign of sabotage.' What is not clear is whose hand is behind the 'attacks' on Iran's nuclear sites.

Sabotage? The same base after the explosion on November 12, which some have claimed was the work of U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies

One retired U.S. official, with up to date intelligence, told the National Journal: 'It's safe to say the Israelis are very active.'

He added about U.S. efforts: 'Everything that [GOP presidential candidate] Mitt Romney said we should be doing - tough sanctions, covert action and pressuring the international community  - are all of the things we are actually doing.'

On November 12, a huge explosion flattened the Revolutionary Guard base at Bid Kaneh, killing 17 people including a founder of Iran's ballistic missile programme.

A separate blast last week badly damaged the uranium enrichment facility in Isfahan.

Two nuclear physicists were killed and Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, were wounded by bombs attached to their cars or detonated near them last year.

Mark Hibbs, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment in Germany, said the intensity of the covert war indicated that this is where the U.S. and Israel are putting their energy for now. 

He said: 'If the U.S. or Israel were determined to take Iran’s nuclear installations out they wouldn’t be wasting time pinpointing individual scientists like this.'

But, he pointed out, Israel’s 1981 attack on Iraq’s Osirak reactor was also preceded by assassination attempts on Iraqi scientists.

Hibbs said: 'Some of the concern in the expert community is that in going down this route we’re unleashing forces we cannot control.' That is seen as a reference to the Stuxnet computer worm which infected the nuclear facilities in 2010, and was believed to be the work of U.S and Israeli engineers.

But a source senior within the Obama administration indicated that the U.S. was not involved in every action. He added: 'I wouldn’t assume that everything we do is coordinated.'

Tensions: Protesters set fire to the British and Israeli flags during demonstrations in the Iranian capital Tehran last week

Anger: A protester breaks the emblem of the British embassy in Tehran after a mob of students attacked the building

Abbasi-Davani accused Great Britain, Israel and the U.S. of conducting attacks on him and other Iranian scientists.

He told a news conference at the annual conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna: 'Six years ago the intelligence service of the UK began collecting information and data regarding my past, my family, the number of children.'

It was the IAEA which produced a report detailing how close Iran was to producing the bomb that has racheted up tension between Washington and Tehran in recent weeks.

It culminated last week with the storming of the British embassy, during which time staff were held hostage and more than £1 million of damage caused, and led Britain to expel Iranian diplomats.

Seeing pictures of the Royal Family torn and historic paintings broken only served to fuel the enmity between the countries.

Dominick Chilcott, Britain's ambassador to Iran who lost his dog in the incident, accused the Iranians of supporting it. That theory appeared founded when the handful of protesters arrested were released without charge earlier this week.

Damage: A shattered window in the office of the British Embassy. Several other countries withdrew their ambassadors after the attack last week, which came in response to further sanctions on Iran's nuclear programme

Then, on Sunday, Bahrain's interior ministry announced that an explosion occurred inside a minibus parked near the British Embassy. However, there were no injuries.

Furthermore, a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador to Washington was uncovered and foiled in the U.S. with America blaming the Iranians, who were celebrating at the weekend the latest in the round of tit-for-tat propaganda victories with the downing on a U.S. drone so hi-tech that no pictures of it have ever been released.

'This is a big prize in terms of technology,' a senior U.S. military source said after the downing of the RQ-170 drone.

Defiant: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said he country will not budge from its nuclear programme, which he insists is for peaceful means

The Iranian news agency said it was show down after illegally crossing the country's eastern border, although a U.S. military official said it had 'absolutely no indication' the drone was shot down.

Neither the Air Force nor manufacturer Lockheed Martin has released much information about the plane, which was dubbed The Beast of Kandahar in 2007 when its existence was finally confirmed.

Early reports suggested that the plane - which supposedly has a wingspan of about 65ft and can fly at around 50,000ft - would be made almost entirely without metal to help it dodge radar.

The White House declined to comment but officials did not seem unduly alarmed, suggesting that the drone's capture would not provide Iran with significant information about U.S. surveillance technology and techniques.

Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington, said the build-up of incidents 'add up to a very worrisome picture'.

This was, he said, in part because 'the Iranians are absorbing all of these assassinations without seeing the pace of their nuclear program slow down to the extent it would be acceptable to the West.'

But if Iranian retaliations grow serious enough, he said, they could provide 'the pretext for a much larger war' in which the Israelis, and possibly the Americans, launch a full attack on Iran.

Gen Jaafari responded by ordering Revolutionary Guard units to move long-range Shahab missile to prevent them being targeted.

The Iranian air force has also been carrying out exercises to respond to any attack from the air and says it will deal seriously with any further incursions into its airspace.

Amid all this comes a report today compiled by the American Enterprise Institute for Publc Policy Research (AEI) that suggested Western efforts to stop Iran getting nuclear weapons had a real chance of failing.

The report says the U.S. would have to 'lead an international effort to contain Iran and deter the Islamic Republic from using its nuclear capability'. The conservative think-tank will release its report, 'Containing and Deterring a Nuclear Iran', later today.

Vice President Danielle Pletka told Foreign Policy Magazine: 'The report is very much an acknowledgement of the very real possibility of failure of the strategy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and any responsible party should recognise that failure is an option.'

The report says Iran could realise its nuclear ambitions before the 2012 U.S. presidential election, with the Obama administration reticent to sanction action before the November ballot.

But other Middle East countries have insisted Iran does not represent a threat to the West.

UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum told CNN: 'I don't believe that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon. Will they hit Israel? How many Palestinians will die? And you think if Iran hits Israel, their cities will be safe? They will be gone the next day.'
