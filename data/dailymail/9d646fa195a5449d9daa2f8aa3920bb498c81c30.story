Friends of the hospital receptionist allegedly shot dead at point-blank range by a prominent surgeon have revealed she was 'deathly afraid' of the man, her former boyfriend.

Jacqueline Wisniewski, 33, was lured into a stairwell at the Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, New York on Wednesday morning and shot multiple times in the head and upper body, police said.

The woman, who had a young son and was training to be a nurse, was allegedly gunned down by her ex-boyfriend Timothy V. Jorden, a former Army weapons expert who is still at large.

Her friends have now revealed that Wisniewski had been in an abusive relationship with the man, who allegedly stalked her and once held her captive in her home, wielding a knife.

Fears: Jackie Wisniewski, left, was allegedly shot dead at blank point range in the hospital where she worked by former boyfriend Dr Timothy Jorden, right, who friends say was abusive

'She told me, "I'm scared",' her friend, Heather Shipley, told the Buffalo News. 'She said: "If anything happens to me, you know who did it".'

Shipley said Wisniewski had 
lived with Jorden but left him as she believed he was having affairs 
with other women. When they broke up after more than a year of dating, he refused to move on.

Wisniewski
said the surgeon had put a GPS tracking device in her car to keep track
of her movements. After she discovered the device, she filed a police 
report, Shipley said.

'[He] knew everywhere 
she was going,' Shipley told WIVB. 'He was driving by her house, sitting in 
the parking lot across from her street, stalking her.'

On another occasion, he held her 
captive in her home for a day and a half with a knife and stabbing her deep enough to draw blood, the 
friend said. He also once gave her a black eye, she said.

'He threatened to kill her a couple 
of times,' Shipley added. 'But I think in her mind she wouldn't believe 
it would actually happen.'

Victim: Jackie Wisnieski, 33, had a young son and was studying to become a nurse

Split: She dated Jorden for a year and lived with him, but they broke up as she thought he was having affairs

But she added: 'She was afraid of him. She was deathly afraid of him.'

Shipley
said she believed her friend did not speak out more as she loved him. 
'She didn't want to get him in trouble because he was a surgeon and she 
didn't want to ruin his reputation,' she explained.

Wisniewski's boss at ECMC's Adolescent Psychiatric Unit, Dori R. Marshall, said the woman had told her she was in an abusive situation with a physician, but did not name him

Cheektowaga
police told the News that Jorden had been involved in two domestic 
incidents in 2003. 'It didn't involve this victim,' said Capt. James J. 
Speyer Jr. 'It was other people.'

The 49-year-old prominent trauma surgeon and former Army medic has eluded authorities since the shooting on Wednesday morning.

Witnesses reported hearing four shots just after 8 a.m. Ms Wisniewski's body was found in a covered passageway connecting the Kidney Center and another wing of the hospital.

Tears: Friend Heather Shipley revealed Wisniewsi was 'deathly scared' of Dr Jorden but loved him

The shooting prompted a four-hour 
lockdown of the hospital, as SWAT teams and K-9 units swarmed the campus
in an attempt to corner the killer.

Authorities
blocked a road leading to Jorden's home in an isolated area of private 
Lake View residences near the Lake Erie shore.

Officers
obtained a warrant and used specialised robotic devices to 
enter and search the home. But hours later, they determined he was not inside.

SWAT team members in camouflage 
arrived in unmarked SUVs and say he may be armed and dangerous.

Police believe Jorden, who they have 
named as a 'person of interest', could be 'special weapons trained' from
his time in the Army.

While many have described him as a popular surgeon, sources told the Buffalo News that he has recently suffered some emotional problems and it is believed he had recently lost 75 pounds.

'He
might have been having mental health issues,' a police official told 
the News. Another official suggested he might have 'some type of serious
physical ailment that caused the drastic weight loss'.

Sources
added that it appeared the man had been living in his office as food 
containers and dirty laundry were found in the ceiling.

Neighbours said he started losing the weight around three months ago, when they also began seeing him at the home less frequently.

Officials said as many as 400 patients and about half of the hospital's 2,000 employees were on the grounds at the time of the deadly shooting.

'The
SWAT Team is in control of the situation,' Buffalo police spokesman 
Michael J. DeGeorge said during a news conference after the shooting. 
'It is an active situation.'

The hospital also diverted emergency room patients to Buffalo General Hospital but most of the campus re-opened at 2 p.m.

'Normally this is very safe,' 
hospital volunteer Lois Peterson told the Buffalo News. 'I've 
volunteered here for 42 years. But this is tragic.'

Police described Jorden as a bald, 
black male, about 6ft 2 and 250 pounds, and showed his photograph at 
check points in the search for tips. Authorities also described the four vehicles - two GMC Sierra pickups, a Cadillac and a Chevrolet Cobalt - registered in his name.

After completing high school, Jorden 
joined the Army and served with the Army's Special Forces, as a weapons 
expert then as a medic.

His military career spanned 18 years and he served in the Caribbean, Japan and Korea.

He earned numerous medals including 
the Army Achievement Medal, Army Commendation Medal and Master Parachute
Badge Scuba Diver Badge Special Forces Tab, ABC reported.

Francisca Wellsbury, who was married to Jorden before they divorce, told ABC she was shocked her former husband was the suspect.

Law enforcement: Authorities, who also swarmed Jorden's home, said the shooting was 'not a random act'

Police presence: Officers hand out photographs of Jorden, who is a 'person of interest' in the crime

Patrol: Staff and patients were refused entry to the hospital over a four-hour period

'We've
lived separate lives for a long time,' Wellsbury, who lives on the West
Coast, said. 'I'm just as shocked as anyone. It's traumatic.'

She added: 'This is not the person I knew. I wish he would seek help.'

Jorden has been licensed to practice 
medicine in New York since 2002 and treats patients at the medical 
center and other major hospitals in the area.

'I've
wanted to be a doctor since early in my military career as a medic,' 
Jorden told the Buffalo News in a 1996 profile, which featured pictures 
of his wife and their son.

He received his certification from 
the American Board of Surgery in 2004. There are no legal actions 
against his license and he has no criminal background.
