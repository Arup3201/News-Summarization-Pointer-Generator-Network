Crystal Palace are close to striking a deal worth £1.5million for Lee Chung-yong, but chairman Steve Parish is believed to be baulking at the South Korea international’s £30,000 per week wage demands.

Lee has six months left on his current contract and is understood to have told team-mates of his desire to leave Bolton Wanderers following a successful six years.

The 26-year-old, signed for £2m in August 2009, has made nearly 200 appearances for Bolton, scoring three goals in 26 games this season.

Alan Pardew is keen to add to his attacking options despite possessing Yannick Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon. But it is understood Parish is reluctant to commit to Lee’s current salary requirements.

It had been thought a leg injury sustained by Lee during South Korea’s 1-0 win over Oman at the Asian Cup last week might curtail a transfer away. Lee was stretchered off 12 minutes from time.

But Bolton manager Neil Lennon revealed on Thursday morning that he should be back within two weeks. 'Chungy’s out, but he’s only out for a week to 10 days,' he said. 'There’s a minuscule hairline fracture which will heal very, very quickly so he’ll be fit in a week or two.’
