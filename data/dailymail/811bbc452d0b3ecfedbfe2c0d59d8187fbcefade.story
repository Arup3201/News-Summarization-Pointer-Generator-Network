Male soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen are now sharing most of their duties with women, and their testosterone-fueled wartime activities are bringing the worst out of many when women are in close quarters with them

President Obama put his foot own on Friday – sort of – and demanded to know what the Defense Department is doing to stem the tide of military sexual assaults. But the answer, he said, can come on December 1, 2014.

That's after the midterm congressional elections, weeks too late to be politically damaging if the military he commands publishes a reminder of how many sex abusers are in the ranks that Obama leads as commander-in-chief.

Thursday saw the passage of a wide-ranging national defense budget authorization bill, which included a watered-down version of sexual-assault reforms favored by New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.

The new law requires the Pentagon to assign an advocate to every servicewoman or man who reports an assault. It also bars commanders from overturning sex-assault verdicts.

But missing from the final bill were Gillibrand's more aggressive proposals, including a move to take sexual assault cases completely out of the military chain of command, and another giving prosecutors – not commanding officers – discretion in deciding which cases to take to military court.

A Republican Senate aide with knowledge of the back-room deals struck as final passage of the bill neared told MailOnline on Friday that the Obama administration and many on Capitol Hill take a more pragmatic approach than Gillibrand.

'Honestly,
 I think there's a fear that the more you demand the Pentagon 
investigate this, the more ugly stuff they'll find,' the aide said. 'And
 when you come right down to it, no one really wants to lower the 
testosterone levels in the military. That's how we win.'

Gillibrand's office did not reply to a request for a response to that statement.

Kirsten Gillibrand is among a group of female U.S. senators who have taken a zero-tolerance position on military sexual assaults

'The more you demand the Pentagon investigate this, the more ugly stuff they'll find,' predicted one Senate aide on the Republican side of the aisle

Obama responded to the new law on Friday by setting a progress deadline for Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, giving them more than eleven months to report back to the White House.

'I do not want to wait another year to 
enact the one reform survivors have asked for,' Gillibrand said in a statement immediately after Obama released his instructions to the military.

She said the priority should be 'removing commanders 
with no legal training and conflicts of interest from the decision of 
whether or not to prosecute a rape or sexual assault.'

'[M]y immediate focus,' Gillibrand added, 'will remain on earning the votes to pass the fundamental reform needed to address the fact that last year alone an estimated 23,000 sexual assault victims lacked the confidence to report their attacks out of fear their chain of command would not act – or worse yet – retaliate against them.'

The White House had released a statement from the president describing how he had 'directed Secretary Hagel, Chairman Dempsey and our entire defense leadership team to step up their game exponentially in preventing and responding to the serious crime of sexual assault in our military.'

'Today,' Obama said, 'I instructed Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey to continue their efforts to make substantial improvements with respect to sexual assault prevention and response, including to the military justice system. I have also directed that they report back to me, with a full-scale review of their progress, by December 1, 2014.'

'If I do not see the kind of progress I expect, then we will consider additional reforms that may be required.'

Major players: Sen. Claire McCaskill (R) pressed her colleagues behind the scenes for tougher action, while Majority Leader Harry Reid (L) promised Gillibrand a separate vote on her no-nonsense measures that were left out of the larger defense bill

What Would Michelle Think? One Senate aide speculated that the president pushed back his deadline until after the 2014 midterm elections because he fears public recognition of how much sexual assault goes on in the military he commands

A White House official told MailOnline that the president 'is serious about resolving this problem in a way that improves, instead of weakens, our military readiness.'

But the GOP Senate aide said that 'there's no way Gillibrand was going to get everything she wanted.'

'First, there are some old-boy types in the Senate who think a lot of this is exaggerated – don't ask me why,' he told MailOnline. 'And then there are some on our side who really don't want to give Democrats another reason to scream "war on women" next November.'

Far-reaching crisis: A Denver man offered $20,000 in cash, a Mercedes-Benz and a $14,000 ring to fellow inmates in an attempt to kill a military rape victim before she testified at his trial

Obama's move to push his next deadline back to December, the aide said, is likely a way 'to keep Democrats' neck out of the noose during the midterms. After all, Obama owns this military, five years in.'

The Senate approved the larger defense bill on an 84–15 vote Thursday. While it includes more than $632 billion for everything from combat pay to new airplanes, the sexual assault provisions provided the most contentious parts of the debate.

The Pentagon has estimated that more than 26,000 military women and men may have been sexually assaulted in 2012. White critics say that estimate is far from a hard number, Defense Department analysts say it could be too low since thousands more are thought to have been too scared to come forward.

Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire 
McCaskill, one of seven women on the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
praised the outcome Thursday as 'a huge win for victims of sexual 
assault, and for justice in America's armed forces.'

'In
 the months and years ahead, vigilance will be required to ensure that 
these historic reforms are implemented forcefully and effectively,' she 
said.

Gillibrand's more 
far-reaching proposals will likely have another hearing as part of a 
separate bill. Majority Leader Harry Reid has reportedly promised her 
that he will give the more aggressive legislative package a vote early 
in 2014.

A Pentagon aide 
told MailOnline that the Defense Department expects to work with the 
White House to develop a series of minimum-standards benchmarks that 
will govern how the military responds to sexual-assault allegations in 
2015 and beyond.
