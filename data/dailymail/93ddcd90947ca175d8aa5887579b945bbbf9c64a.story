Britain's share of households where no one works is among the worst in Europe, shock figures revealed yesterday.

The finding suggests that in an economy far more resilient than those of the stricken eurozone, many Britons appear to continue to prefer a life on benefits to work.

There may be particular concern over the workless rate among UK single mothers. Only Ireland and tiny Malta among the other 26 EU states have a higher proportion without work.

Shocking: Britain's share of households where no one works is among the worse in Europe

The analysis will further fuel the row, with Labour over the Coalition's proposed cap on benefits increases.

The figures from the EU statistical arm Eurostat cover 2011 and show the share of homes where no adult wokrs more than a day a week.

In Britain the level has fallen from 13.1 per cent in the previous year to 11.5 per cent.

The reduction may be due to an earlier tightening up of sickness benefits by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.

Yet even with the fall, Greece and Spain - where steeply rising unemployment rates have been linked to social unrest and riots - are only slightly worse off.

Britain's lower unemployment rate hides the many people who have signed off work permanently due to sickness or disability.

In Spain the workless home rate has risen to 12.2 per cent, while in Greece it stands at 11.8 per cent.

Only Belgium and three eastern European countries are ahead of the UK. Ireland has yet to report overall workless figures for 2011.

And more than 43 per cent of single parents in Britain do not work for more than one day a week - higher than anywhere except Ireland.

This suggests that the tax credit system introduced 15 years ago has failed in its aim of getting any single parents into work.

Critics of benefits in Britain have long complained that the system means work does not pay for millions.

The Tories have been attacked by Labour for suggesting that the cap is designed to reward strivers rather than shirkers.
