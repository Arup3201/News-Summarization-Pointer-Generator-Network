A 22-year-old Connecticut man has admitted to police he used a fire poker and then a buck knife to ruthlessly gut his own mother and pull out her intestines on Thursday.

A chilling police report shows that Robert Owen Rankin of Deep River didn’t know exactly what all the guts and gore he pulled from his mother Margaret Rohner, 45, were, but he knew why he was doing it.

‘I don't know exactly what the stuff was, like octopus tentacles,’ he would coolly recount to police. ‘I killed my mother because she is pretty much responsible for everything that has gone wrong in my life.’

Praying for help? Robert Owen Rankin, 22, confessed to police that he awoke Thursday morning and then viciously slaughtered his own mother. This is the last picture of the  Connecticut man, posted to Facebook on Christmas Day, on day before the alleged murder

Slaughtered: Margaret Rohner was allegedly disemboweled by her own son on the day after Christmas and found naked and sliced open at the bottom of the stairs of her own Deep River, Connecticut home

The gruesome events began to unfold Thursday morning at Rohner’s home.

Rankin allegedly detailed the unfathomable act first to his father and then the state trooper who initially encountered the horrific scene.

Rankin said he woke up with a plan to snap his mother’s neck, reports NBC Connecticut.

He said she began to scream as soon as he'd wrapped his arms around her throat.

When that didn’t work, he said he fetched a fire poker and hit or stabbed her in the neck before continuing to choke her.

Police swarmed the home Deep River, Connecticut home after 1pm on Thursday and encountered a grisly scene

Shocking: Rankin (left) said he disemboweled his mother (right) because she 'is pretty much responsible for everything that has gone wrong in my life.' At left, a photo of Rankin was posted to Rohner's Facebook wall with the caption, 'My great kid Bobby Rankin and I had a good day today!'

She still clung to life, however. Before continuing the slaughter, Rankin said he removed his clothes to ‘gain additional strength.’

Rankin described to police his mother’s ‘fighting, punching and screaming’ during the attack and as he returned to his bedroom to get a knife and finish her off.

He said he stabbed her at the belly button with a buck knife and sliced upwards.

Once she 'stopped screaming,' Rankin said he then removed his mother's clothes.

‘I just want you to know that she put up a damn good fight,’ court documents say Rankin told his father. ‘ She is a strong woman.  I give her credit for that.’

Bizarre: Rankin said he pulled out his mother's intestines and stomach 'see if there was a baby'

Police say Rankin coolly recounted the gruesome tale after first confessing to his father Robert Rankin Sr, who then called Connecticut State Troopers

Along with blood thirsty rage came a bizarre curiosity. Rankin said he pulled out his mother’s intestines ‘like octopus tentacles’ in order to ‘see if there was a baby.’

After he killed her, he told police, he took a shower and walked the dog.

Police would later find Rohner’s carved up naked body and the bottom of some stairs. Her entrails were found in a wood stove in the home and in a bucket beside the stove, according to court documents.

After hearing the confession, Rankin’s father Robert Rankin Jr. called 911 around 1pm.

‘My son killed my ex-wife,’ the father said according to courant.com. '[She has a] big hole in her gut.'

Rankin would soon back up his father’s story.

‘I used the knife to kill my mother,’ he told police, who then confiscated the buck knife.

The trooper asked Rankin if anyone else had been involved.

'It was all me,' he said.

According to courant.com, Rankin remained emotionless as he was questioned by police.

'I will tell you anything you want to know,' he said. 'I tried to make my mother responsible for the terrible things she has done.'

Rankin was arrested and charged with murder. 

He appeared before a judge Friday, where a public defender argued Rankin has 'severe psychological issues that have not been addressed.'

Rankin told authorities he was not under the influence of any drugs, nor was he taking any medications at the time of the murder.

Ranking remained behind bars Friday after a Middletown Superior Court judge set bond at $1 million.

Rankin is under suicide watch as per the request of his attorney Dennis P. McMahon.

'You were a beautiful loving caring person you will be truly missed fly with the angels,' reads a touching note posted along with the Facebook photo during an inconceivable tragedy
