An 11,500-year-old grave containing the remains of three infants has been discovered in Alaska.

The babies had been buried by North America's earliest inhabitants - 'Paleo-Indians' - who crossed over a land bridge from Siberia called Beringia, which existed at the end of the last Ice Age.

Early tools found on the continent were also found alongside the babies' remains.

An 11,500 year old grave (pictured) containing the remains of three infants has been found in Alaska. The babies had been buried by North America's earliest inhabitants - 'Paleo-Indians' - who crossed over a land bridge from Siberia that existed at the end of the last Ice Age

It is thought that small groups of hunter-gatherers migrated with herds of large animals and travelled around Alaska.

The skeleton of a three-year-old was found four years ago at an archaeological site at Upper Sun River in the Tanana lowlands forest in central Alaska and had been cremated.

Now, excavations have revealed the skeletons of two more infants in a circular pit about 15 inches (38cm) below the other child, who was buried beneath the remains of a 'seasonal' house.

Experts claim that the first infant died shortly after birth and the other was a late-term foetus. It's possible they could have been twins.

Anthropologist Ben Potter and his team at Alaska University said the discovery offers a rare opportunity to learn how North America's first settlers dealt with the deaths of their young.

The skeleton of a three-year-old was found four years ago at an archaeological site at Upper Sun River in the Tanana lowlands forest in central Alaska (marked at A) and had been cremated 

Paleo-Indians were the first people who entered and inhabited the American continents during the first glacial episodes of the late Pleistocene period.

Experts think they crossed the Bering Strait from Eurasia into North America over a land bridge called Beringia that existed between 47,000 and 14,000 years ago.

Small, isolated groups of the hunter gatherers and big game hunters migrated with herds of large herbivores into the heart of Alaska.

Stone tools - especially projectile points and scrapers - are evidence of the earliest human activity in the Americas. 

The burial site also shows that ancient residents of Alaska foraged for fish, birds and small mammals, as well as large game.

Scientists believe the house was occupied in summer based on the bones from salmon and immature ground squirrels found there.

Dr Potter said the infant skeletons were largely complete. 

The first was lying face up with knees tightly flexed towards the chest.

The child's left arm was flexed across the chest with hand near the chin and the right arm extended across the torso to the left.

The foetus seems to have originally been placed upright with knees also tightly flexed. 

But when discovered, the torso was prone over the legs and the left arm extended beside the back and behind the pelvis.

Stone projectile points and associated decorated antler foreshafts were discovered in the  burial pit at the Upward Sun River site. They were all coated with red ochre and are the earliest known exampled of hafted stone tools in North America

Goods placed in the grave consisted of four antler rods decorated with abstract incised lined and two spear points placed parallel to each other and adjacent to the foetus. A third stone tool was placed next to the rods. 

They were all coated with red ochre and are the earliest known exampled of hafted stone tools in North America.

'The presence of hafted points may reflect the importance of hunting implements in the burial ceremony and with the population as whole,' the paper says. 

Dr Potter said domestic activities would have included hunting of salmon, small mammals and birds along with large mammals further afield. 

The human remains and associated burial offerings - as well as inferences about the time of year the children died and were buried - could lead to new thinking about how early societies were structured.

They could also shed light upon the stresses they faced as they tried to survive, how they treated the youngest members of their society, as well as how they viewed death and the importance of rituals associated with it.

'Taken collectively, these burials and cremation reflect complex behaviours related to death among the early inhabitants of North America,' Dr Potter said.

Dr Potter said: 'The infants and grave goods were placed in the bottom of the pit which was immediately backfilled with sediment containing a small quantity of burned fish and small mammal specimens from earlier consumption events.

'If individuals one and two were twins, the former survived birth for at least five weeks whereas the latter died earlier in utero. 

'So the two were not interred together during a single burial event.

Individual one was clearly a primary interment. Thus it is possible individual two represents a secondary burial - placed in the pit after individual one died. This scenario could explain the different positions.'

He said the three year-old died later and was cremated in the residential hearth.

University of Alaska Fairbanks professors Ben Potter and Josh Reuther excavate the burial pit at the Upward Sun River site. They discovered skeletons as well as decorated stone tools

Professor Joel Irish from Liverpool John Moores University, was involved in the study.

He examined dental and skeletal remains to determine the probable age and other information about the infants. For the double burial, he estimated the times of death and said that one survived birth by a few weeks, while the other died in the womb.

According to Professor Irish, 'the deaths are consistent with high levels of childhood death in highly mobile hunter–gatherers, which have been reported to be as high as 45 per cent in recent arctic/subarctic groups.'

However, he also said that 'the nearly concurrent deaths of two infants and a child could have been more harmful than usual to the small group regarding long-term demographic effects, if additional births did not occur relatively soon.'

The artifacts—including the projectile points and plant and animal remains—may also help to build a more complete picture of early human societies and how they were structured, as well as how they survived climate changes at the end of the last great Ice Age, the team said. 

The presence of two burial events—the buried infants and cremated child—within the same dwelling could also indicate relatively longer-term residential occupation of the site than previously expected.

The remains of salmon-like fish and ground squirrels in the burial pit indicate that the site was likely occupied by hunter-gatherers between June and August.

'The deaths occurred during the summer, a time period when regional resource abundance and diversity was high and nutritional stress should be low, suggesting higher levels of mortality than may be expected give our current understanding' of survival strategies of the period, the authors wrote.
