A 28-year-old woman, believed to be the girl’s mother, was also arrested and has been released on police bail.

‘A
19-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman have been arrested in 
connection with the child’s death and are currently in custody at Thorpe
Wood Police Station.’

A post-mortem examination will be carried out today to establish the cause of death.

A teddy bear had been left outside the front door in tribute to the girl.

Residents living on the estate spoke of their shock on hearing the news.

Speaking to The Peterborough Telegraph, one
man said: 'I was walking my dog at about 10am yesterday when I saw and 
heard a woman crying. Police were there some time later, and have not 
left since.'
