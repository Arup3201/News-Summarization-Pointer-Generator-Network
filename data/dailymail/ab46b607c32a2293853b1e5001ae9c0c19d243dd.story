A mother today described her horror when her 10-day-old baby coughed up a breathing tube after doctors neglected to remove it.

After Owen Thomas was born he was fitted with the endotracheal tube at Stafford Hospital, Staffs, because he was not breathing. This occurred after one of his shoulders became stuck during birth - something referred to as shoulder dystocia.

However, staff then failed to remove the 6in-long PVC tube and he struggled to cough it up more than a week later.

Owen Thomas sits with his mother Clare and father Kev. The couple brought a claim of clinical negligence against their local NHS trust after son, when he was a baby, coughed up a breathing tube

His parents Clare Thomas, 33, and husband Kev, 35, from Cannock, Staffordshire, have now won a claim of clinical negligence against the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.

Owen, four, was not affected long-term by the incident but Mrs Thomas says she believes her son would have died had she not been there when he brought up the tube in February 2007.

Mrs Thomas also said she had expressed her concerns about Owen in the first few days of his life but was told by medical staff there was nothing to worry about.

'When Owen was 10 days old, my husband and a friend of mine were visiting me in the specialist care unit at Stafford Hospital,' she said.

'Owen turned blue and looked like he was choking. So I slapped him on the back and this tube came out.

'The nurse took him off me and gave him oxygen as well as checking him over.'

She added: 'If I had not been there, I think he would have died - he had gone very blue.'

Mrs Thomas decided she did not want to have her second child at Stafford and instead gave birth to daughter Phoebe at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton two years ago.

Mrs and Mr Thomas said they believe there have only been two similar incidents worldwide.

The couple were awarded a five-figure sum but Mrs Thomas preferred not to reveal the amount.

Colin Ovington, director of nursing & midwifery at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We can confirm that this case has been settled.'

Stafford Hospital hit the headlines in 2009 when a report was published by the Healthcare Commission that found there were 400 more death than expected at the trust from 2005 to 2008.

An independent inquiry in 2010 claimed patients were routinely neglected at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, after it became driven by targets and cost-cutting.
