Spring break revelers were being urged to avoid traveling to Mexico this year due to ongoing drug-related violence.

The Texas Department of Public Safety said on Tuesday that  cartels operating in the country pose a safety threat because of their 'unpredictable' movements.

Last September, 43 Mexican college students went missing and were later confirmed dead after being captured by an organized crime gang in the southwestern city of Iguala. 

Kidnappings, highway robberies and shoot-outs have also been reported in other resort areas including Acapulco, Guadalajara, Mazatlan, Cancun and Puerto Vallarta.

In past years U.S. authorities have raised similar concerns about spring break travel south of the country.

Once again extra numbers of state troopers will be patrolling the border areas as the holidays kick off.

Stratfor, an intelligence consultancy firm, previously warned that it is not just Mexicans the cartels target.

Following a 2013 report on illegal activity in the area, it concluded: 'There is a misconception that cartels want to avoid interfering with the profitable tourism industry, or that they only target Mexican citizen.

'This simply is not true.'

Travelers are encouraged to use pre-arranged transport, travel in groups and avoid driving at night.

They are also advised to hide indicators of wealth such as expensive-looking jewelry, watches, or cameras.

The U.S. Department of State notes that casinos or other gambling clubs and adult entertainment establishments are areas of particular safety concern.

Many students at the University of Texas-Pan American agreed that Mexico would not be a good choice for spring break.

One graduate told Valleycentral.com: 'It’s violent and the kidnappings have gone up in the last few months. 

'They are kidnapping a lot of Americans to get ransom money, so it could be dangerous.'

The number of U.S. citizens murdered in Mexico was 81 in 2013 and 85 in 2014, according to the Department of State.

Meanwhile, kidnappings throughout the region  appear to be on the rise. Between January and November of 2014 more than 130 abductions of U.S. citizens were reported.
