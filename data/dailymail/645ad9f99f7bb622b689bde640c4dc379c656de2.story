Britain is operating a secret listening post based in the Middle East which collects emails, phone calls and web traffic on behalf of Western intelligence agencies, it has been reported.

The existence of the facility reportedly came to light following the leaks made by US fugitive Edward Snowden.

The site accesses web traffic by tapping into underwater fibre optic cables connecting the region to the internet. The location of the site has not been reported.

Fears it could be discovered was one of the reasons the Government asked the Guardian to destroy hard drives containing a copy of the Snowden files, according to The Independent.

The operation is part of a wider GCHQ surveillance and monitoring system, code-named Tempora, a £1 billion scheme to monitor communications around the world.

Information collected at the installation, which the Government has reportedly described as an important tool in the West's 'War on Terror', is sent to GCHQ's headquarters in Cheltenham and shared with the National Security Agency in the US.

Content is held in storage 'buffers' before being sifted for material of particular interest.

The listening post was established under the last government under a warrant signed by former foreign secretary David Miliband.

The warrant authorised GCHQ to collect information about the 'political intentions of foreign powers', terrorism, proliferation, mercenaries and private military companies, and serious financial fraud.

The issue is revisited every six months and can be changed by ministers at will. GCHQ officials are free to target anyone who is overseas or communicating from overseas without further checks or controls if they think they fall within the terms of a current certificate.

The Independent said the information about the project was contained in 50,000 GCHQ documents Mr Snowden downloaded during 2012.

Much of the material reportedly came from an internal Wikipedia-style site called GC-Wiki. Unlike the public Wikipedia, GCHQ's wiki was generally classified Top Secret or above.

In a statement published by The Guardian, Mr Snowden denied being the source for the Independent report.

He said: 'I have never spoken with, worked with, or provided any journalistic materials to the Independent. The journalists I have worked with have, at my request, been judicious and careful in ensuring that the only things disclosed are what the public should know but that does not place any person in danger.

'People at all levels of society up to and including the President of the United States have recognised the contribution of these careful disclosures to a necessary public debate, and we are proud of this record.

'It appears that the UK government is now seeking to create an appearance that the Guardian and Washington Post's disclosures are harmful, and they are doing so by intentionally leaking harmful information to The Independent and attributing it to others.

'The UK government should explain the reasoning behind this decision to disclose information that, were it released by a private citizen, they would argue is a criminal act.'

The Foreign Office has refused to confirm or deny the accuracy of the reports, saying only that it did not comment on intelligence matters.

Counter terrorism police last night started a criminal investigation into thousands of secret intelligence files obtained by The Guardian newspaper.

Scotland Yard said documents seized from David Miranda, partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, contained ‘highly sensitive material ... which could put lives at risk’.

Carrying documents that could be useful to terrorists carries a maximum ten-year jail sentence under the controversial Terrorism Act 2000.

Officers who questioned the 28-year-old Brazilian for nearly nine hours at Heathrow have now begun an international investigation into how he was carrying ‘tens of thousands’ of pages of material including secret files leaked by ex-CIA analyst Edward Snowden.
