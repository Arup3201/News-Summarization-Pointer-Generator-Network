Kim Jong-Il's estranged playboy son has made a secret visit to North Korea using a false passport to pay respects to his father, it was revealed today.

Kim Jong-Nam, 40, flew from the Chinese territory of Macau direct to Pyongyang, according to a report in Japan.

With his 27-year-old half-brother, Kim Jong-Un - who is now supreme commander of everything in North Korea - he stood beside their father's body and paid their respects before the older man returned to Macau.

Dead: Kim Jong-Il who died of a heart attack last month aged 69

In order not to draw attention to himself or raise controversy about why he was not appointed to take his father's place, he did not even attend Kim Jong-Il's state funeral on December 28.

It is not known whether any animosity arose between the half-brothers, who were at the centre of rumours in 2009 suggesting that people around Jong-Un had tried to assassinate his older brother in Macau.

Sources in North Korea said the plan to assassinate Jong-Nam was foiled after Beijing heard about it and spirited Jong-Nam away from Macau to a safe place.

According to the respected Japanese daily newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, Jong-Nam took immediate steps to fly to Pyongyang from Macau, where he usually lives, on December 17 after learning of his father's death that day.

He used a passport under the false 
identity of Kim Chol and avoided travelling via Beijing which would have
drawn attention to his visit.

North Korea vowed to stage an all-out drive for prosperity as it unites behind new leader Kim Jong-Un, ushering in 2012 with promises to resolve food shortages, bolster its military and defend Kim Jong Il's young son 'unto death'.

The pledge in North Korea's annual New Year's message, released by the official Korean Central News Agency, comes as the country enters a new era.

The message said: 'Glorify this year 2012 as a year of proud victory, a year when an era of prosperity is unfolding.

'The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should possess a firm conviction that they will become human bulwarks and human shields in defending Kim Jong Un unto death.'

North Korea said it would boost its military, and boasted that it was 'at the epochal point of opening the gates of a thriving country', with parts of Pyongyang 'turned into socialist fairylands'.

The message also acknowledged the country's food crisis, saying 'the food problem is a burning issue'.

Pyongyang had been in talks with the United States on food aid, but they stopped because of Kim Jong Il's death.

He did not attend the state funeral because he did not want to give rise to arguments about 'why the third (son) should become the successor,' a source told the paper.

The paper said it had been told that Kim Jong-Nam 'pulled out of the succession race several years ago by himself, saying he had no interest in politics.'

He has lived abroad for many years and has been seen in Macau, Singapore and Beijing, after apparently falling out of favour with his father for trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001.

There was unhappiness in Pyongyang, too, about reports that he was spending most of his time playing roulette in the casinos of Macau.

As his health failed, Dear Leader Kim Jong-Il decided it was his youngest son from another marriage who should continue the dynasty.

Jong-Un has been named 'the great successor' and supreme commander of the military following his father's death at the age of 69 from a heart attack.

Last week a South Korean news agency reported that Jong-Nam had been 'placed under Chinese protection' amid speculation that another assassination attempt might be made against him to stamp out continuing controversy surrounding him.

Jong-Nam has dismissed talk of a death plot against him, saying they are 'a farce'.
