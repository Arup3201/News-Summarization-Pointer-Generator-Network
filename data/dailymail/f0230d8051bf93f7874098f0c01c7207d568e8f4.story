NBA star LeBron James led the get well wishes after Jozy Altidore’s World Cup campaign appeared to be all but over.

The Sunderland striker was reduced to tears after being taken off on a stretcher off midway through the first half of the USA’s 2-1 win over Ghana with a hamstring injury.

Altidore’s time in Brazil looks finished, with Miami Heat ace James among those wishing the 24-year-old a speedy recovery.

He tweeted: ‘Keep well Jozy! Hate to see that happen.’

Aron Johannsson came on in Altidore’s place, and Clint Dempsey has challenged the rest of USA’s strikers to step up to the plate to help fill the void.

He said: ‘You could see the tears in his eyes going back to the locker room... Other players have to step up now.’

Meanwhile, Jurgen Klinsmann hailed his side’s character as John Brooks earned them a dramatic victory against the Ghanaians.

The Americans looked like being denied three points when Andre Ayew cancelled out Dempsey’s lightning-quick opener – the fifth fastest goal in World Cup history.

However, substitute Brooks popped up with a header in the dying minutes as Klinsmann celebrated his 50th game in charge with a win.

His side were under the cosh for the majority of the second half, and he paid tribute to the way they responded after being rocked by Ghana’s equaliser.

He said: ‘We have a great spirit – the US team always does and fights until the last second.

‘I said to the bench: “we are going to get another chance in the game”.

‘Ghana are a very good team, which is what we expected. But we got the three points that we wanted. It was well deserved.’
