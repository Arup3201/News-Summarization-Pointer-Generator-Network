Two drivers were injured when a massive freight train derailed in northern Greece and crumpled into a pile of twisted metal.

A 'slight landslide' forced it off the tracks as it passed through the tiny Gefyra settlement en route to Hungary, local website News 247 has reported.

15 of its 30 carriages derailed in the horrific accident which has now blocked the track linking Greece's second largest city Thessaloniki and Belgrade in Serbia 'indefinitely'.

The local people inspecting the wreckage are completely dwarfed by the enormity of the train's containers.

The train was carrying electronic equipment from the Greek port city of Konya although it is unclear who the goods belonged to.

Initial reports suggest heavy rains caused the train to derail following a slight landslide near the settlement where it crashed.

Just last month in Greece, four people died when a passenger train struck a truck at a rail crossing in the country's north.

At least seven of the 30 people injured in that crash were in a serious condition, the local fire brigade said.

Fire Chief Andreas Kois said: 'We fear that many more are trapped under the four wagons. We cannot say what condition they are in.

The train was travelling from the north-eastern city of Alexandroupolis to the port of Thessaloniki - where the derailed freight train began its journey - when it drove into the vehicle.
