She was nicknamed The Body thanks to those famous Sports Illustrated shoots that showed off her lithe limbs and golden glow - and, unsurprisingly, Elle Macpherson is safeguard to keep the looks that catapulted her to fame.

Elle, who turned 50 in March, has launched five new professional beauty tools to extend her successful The Body wellbeing gadget line which launched in 2010.

Elle has used the tips and tricks she's picked up over her many years in the fashion and beauty industry to create a range of products she hopes will help women achieve her polished look at home.

Beauty buff: Supermodel Elle Macpherson has made a fortune looking good and now she's created a range of tools to help women stay preened

One of her hero products is the £39.99 Wet and Dry Face and Body Brush. Speaking about the exfoliater, she says: 'A key part of my beauty regime is exfoliation. The benefits are amazing, helping to remove dead skin cells, increase circulation and aid cell renewal.

'I always feel a noticeable difference leaving my skin smooth and glowing. Take the hassle out of dry brushing with my new 4 in 1 wet and dry brush. The battery-powered rotating head means it does all the hard work for you! You can use it all over your body and it's even suitable for the shower.'

There is also a £19.99 heel smoother, which aims to give an at-home pedicure. 'It's so easy to neglect your feet but as summer approaches, keeping them in tip-top condition is a must,' Elle said.

The supermodel has also included a hot wax epilator in the range, a manicure and pedicure kit and a compact mirror.

Clearly Elle isn't letting reaching her half century dampen her career goals. She also recently unveiled a range of supergreens.

Speaking at the launch, the supermodel said: 'I feel loved, balanced, happy, healthy and at peace with who I am.

'Feeling good on the inside is more important to me now...looking good follows. My secret? Love, laughter...and my super greens.'

The body: Elle Macpherson turned fifty earlier this year and has unveiled her own super greens to celebrate. Clearly the Australian supermodel has no plans on slowing down

Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she has unveiled her very own brand.

Elle introduced The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements, formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention.

The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function.

Strength: 'The Super Elixir balances and strengthens me, to enable me to be the woman and mother I want to be, and now I want to share it!,' says Elle

The product, which costs £98, is designed to support healthy nutrition at a cellular level and aid the digestive, endocrine (hormonal), circulatory and nervous systems. 

Packed with 45 key ingredients, including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom, Elle claims that just 10g of the powder daily contains all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements you need to promote wellness and vitality.

'There's so much discussion surrounding health and fitness but what I really aspire to is wellness. Spiritual, emotional and physical...and in my experience they are closely interrelated,' she explains.

Model behaviour: Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model, which Elle was a judge on, was cancelled last year

'It's not something you achieve simply through going to the gym, using expensive creams or speaking to a therapist, it's a feeling of balance and strength that originates from within and on a cellular level.

Elle's new collaborations come at just the right time for the model, who was dealt two sets of bad news last year.

Fashion Star, the show she hosted in 2012 and produced in 2013, was cancelled in July.

Three
 months later it was announced that the other show Macpherson starred 
in, Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model, was also cancelled.

Elle, who began modelling in the early 80s in order to earn money to pay for her law books, also has several other business ventures under her belt, including a lingerie line and skincare range.
