A 'fugitive' U.S. businessman who was detained for more than two years in Bolivia without charge in a money laundering investigation has arrived back in America.

A State Department official, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name, has confirmed Jacob Ostreicher had left Bolivia. The agency would give no details on his departure or travel to the U.S., the official said.

Bolivia's government says it considers Ostreicher a fugitive after unknown groups helped him flee across the border into Peru.

Justice Minister Cecilia Allyon said 
in a press conference today she doesn't know whether the U.S. government
 played a role in Ostreicher's escape. She said Bolivia is alerting 
Interpol.

Allyon said Ostreicher entered Peru illegally and then boarded a U.S.-bound plane on Monday. Ostreicher has yet to appear in public since arriving in the U.S.

Family members had contacted The Associated Press earlier Monday saying they had not heard from Ostreicher in a few days and feared he had been kidnapped.

Later, a brother, Aron Ostreicher, called saying Ostreicher might be in the U.S. The brother then stopped answering his phone and email.

Ostreicher's daughter, Gitty Weinberger, said Monday evening in a phone interview from her home in New Jersey that she had been informed of her father's safe arrival in the US but the two had not yet spoken.

Bolivian government officials said they did not know whether Ostreicher had left the country, but were aware of the report.

Deputy Interior Minister Jorge Perez 
said it would have been difficult for Ostreicher to get out, given the 
media attention to his case.

Col.
 Edmundo Rivero, head of police in the city of Santa Cruz, where 
Ostreicher was put under house arrest, said he was checking with 
immigration authorities on the possibility the American left.

The New York Times has reported a person, who is said to be familiar with aspects of how Ostreicher left house arrest, said there was 'an operation to get him out by professionals'.

The source said he was taken to a neighbouring country before being moved on to Los Angeles and then New York.

Ostreicher spent 18 months in a 
Bolivian jail without charges on suspicion of money laundering while 
trying to salvage a rice-growing venture. He was released a year ago and
 put under house arrest after actor Sean Penn and several U.S. lawmakers
 directly appealed to President Evo Morales to free him.

The
 case has resulted in Bolivian authorities implicating a judge, the 
initial prosecutors and lower-level officials in an alleged scheme to 
shake down Ostreicher and other people deemed to have deep pockets.

Ostreicher,
 an Orthodox Jew who has a flooring business in Brooklyn, complained 
from the time he was jailed in June 2011 that he was being fleeced by 
corrupt officials.

His case
 came to notice when he accused the struggling rice venture's original 
manager, a Colombian woman who also was jailed, of defrauding investors 
and falling in with a Brazilian drug trafficker.

Ostreicher charged later that prosecutors
 and other government employees had illegally sold 18,000 metric tons of
 the venture's rice and stole equipment as well as demanded a $50,000 
payoff to get him out of jail.

'They robbed me of close to $50 million worth of assets,' Ostreicher told the AP in an interview a year ago. He said that in addition to the rice, about 900 cattle disappeared along with 37 tractors and harvesting equipment.

Bolivian authorities have said since that 15 people had been arrested in the alleged extortion ring, including an assistant to the judicial director of the Interior Ministry.

Last June, prosecutors said two low-ranking officials among those arrested had pleaded guilty and were cooperating in hopes of serving less jail time.
