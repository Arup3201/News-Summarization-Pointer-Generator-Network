It's emerged a disabled football fan who claimed to be the first ever wheelchair bound coach working in the professional game when he joined Manchester United this season was never employed by the club.

Sohail Rehman, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, announced last August he would be working for Manchester United Soccer Schools as coach for teenagers who go for United trials, as well as visiting schools to train children. 

Sohail Rehman said he would be working for Manchester United Soccer Schools as a coach for teenagers

Sohail Rehman had helped out as coach for Sunday league matches and tournaments in Yorkshire

Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson wrote to encourage Sohail Rehman

This led to Rehman getting considerable publicity including interviews with BBC Radio 5 Live, Soccer AM, talkSPORT and BBC North West. 

Rehman, who had received a letter of congratulations about his coaching qualifications from Sir Alex Ferguson said at the time: ‘Big thanks to David Moyes, I did a coaching session at United and after that he was basically saying how impressed he was with me. He wanted to get me on board with the club, he started everything off.’

A United spokesman was also quoted as saying: ‘Since coming to the training ground, everyone at Manchester United has welcomed Sohail with open arms.’ 

Rehman admited he questioned his own ability to coach players as he cannot play the game himself

Rehman believed his analysis was strong enough to get him into the Premier League

However United cannot trace anyone at the club responsible for that and other comments and a spokesman said: ‘Sohail Rehman has never been engaged or employed by any company owned by Manchester United, Manchester United Foundation, or Manchester United Soccer Schools. He has a letter from Sir Alex Ferguson because Sir Alex used to write letters of encouragement to young coaches and to individuals who have overcome adversity in their lives.

‘It is not an endorsement of his credentials. Sohail watched training as a participant in a Dream Day that the club regularly delivers for disadvantaged young people.’

Rehman was unavailable for comment. 

Rehman was born with spinal muscular atrophy, which breaks the connection between muscles and nerves
