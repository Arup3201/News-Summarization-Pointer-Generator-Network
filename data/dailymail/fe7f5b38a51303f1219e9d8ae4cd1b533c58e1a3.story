A first-hand account of the Navy SEAL mission that killed Osama bin Laden is coming out September 11 - the 11th anniversary of the devastating terror attacks in New York and Washington, DC.

The book's publisher announced on today that Mark Owen's 'No Easy Day' will 'set the record straight' on the raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011 that led to the terrorist leader's death.

'Mark Owen' is a pseudonym for the combat veteran who was one of the first fighters to enter bin Laden's third floor hideout and also witnessed his death, according to Dutton, an imprint of Penguin Group. 

The co-author, journalist Kevin Maurer, has worked on four previous books - including two in the last year and a half about soldiers in Afghanistan.

Maurer spent the last several years embedded with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan as a military correspondent for the Fayetteville Observer.

One senior military official said the manuscript was not shared with special operations officials, to check for possible disclosure of classified information. 

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the vetting of classified information.

The New York Times's Media Decoder blog reported that the book also goes into detail about Owen's incredible training that led him to become a Navy SEAL.

The blog said that Owen's 'blow by blow' account of the raid will begin with the helicopter crash in bin Laden's backyard that almost killed him to the terror mastermind's death.

Owen has since retired from active duty.

Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan

Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House

And just because the author is remaining anonymous does not mean that he won't do a book tour, as The Times reports that Owen will make TV appearances while wearing a disguise.

No Easy Day's listing on Amazon.com says that among Owen's hundreds of missions around the world as a Team Six commando was the rescue of Capt Richard Phillips from Somali pirates in 2009.

Owen's book comes on the heels of 
another account of the bin Laden takedown that claims the raid was nixed
three times by Obama, but finally went ahead at the urging of Hillary 
Clinton.

Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down

Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama

That explosive allegation is contained in an expose by journalist Rich Miniter, who argues that the White House’s carefully-crafted narrative of Obama as a decisive leader who took out the al-Qaeda leader despite the doubts of advisers is a myth.

Leading from Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him was published on Tuesday.

A film about the bin Laden raid, Zero Dark Thirty - from Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow - is due to be released December 19.
