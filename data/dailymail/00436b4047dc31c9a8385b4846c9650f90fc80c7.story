Most wanted: Zulkifli bin Abdul Hir, leader of an al Qaeda linked terror group in Asia, has apparently been killed in an air strike on a southern Philippines island

South-east Asia's most-wanted terrorist and two other senior militants were killed today in a U.S.-backed air strike in the Philippines, military chiefs said.

Malaysian Zulkifi bin Hir, known as Marwan, a top leader of the al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah terror network was apparently killed in a dawn strike on a militant stronghold on a southern island.

The leader of the Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf militants, Umbra Jumdail, and Singaporean leader in Jemaah Islamiyah, Abdullah Ali, were also apparently killed.

The bodies of the three men have not yet been recovered from the heavily-forested mountain camp because the area remains under the control of another rebel group - the Moro National Liberation Front - so their deaths have not been officially confirmed.

Major General Noel Coballes said no one was captured in the strike and some militants escaped, before returning later to retrieve the bodies of those who died.

Around 30 militants were in the camp near Parang town on Jolo Island - the Abu Sayyaf stronghold which they share with Indonesian-based Jemaah Islamiyah - when it was bombarded by two OV10 aircraft.

Maj Gen Coballes said: 'Our report is there were at least 15 killed, including their three leadership.

'This is a deliberate, fully planned attack coming from our forces.'

The U.S. had offered a $5million reward for the capture of Marwan, a U.S.-trained engineer accused of involvement in a number of deadly bombings in the Philippines and in the training of new militants.

Target: Abu Pula, also known as Dr Abu, was the leader of Abu Sayyaf and the militant stronghold was run by his group

American counter-terrorism troops have helped ill-equipped Filipino troops track Marwan for years using satellite and drone surveillance.

Around 600 U.S. special forces have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002, providing a crucial support for its counter-terrorism operations.

If confirmed, Marwan's death would mark the most important success against regional terror network Jemaah Islamiyah since the January 2011 arrest of Indonesian suspect Umar Patek in Pakistan's garrison town of Abottabad, where Osama bin Laden was killed in a U.S. commando attack four months later.

Patek and Marwan collaborated with Abu Sayyaf in training militants in bomb-making skills, seeking funding locally and abroad and plotting attacks, including against American troops in the southern Philippines.

Patek is believed to have travelled back to Indonesia and then onward to Pakistan, leaving Marwan to take charge in the southern Philippines, military officials said.

Marwan's death would also be a huge blow to Abu Sayyaf's ability to recover from years of battle setbacks through fundraising and training of new militants.

During today's attack, the Philippines air force dropped four bombs weighing 500lb each from two planes, said Major General Jose Villarete, head of the 3rd Air Division based in Zamboanga city.

Abu Sayyaf is behind numerous ransom kidnappings, bomb attacks and beheadings which have terrorised the Philippines for more than two decades.

U.S.-backed Philippines offensives have been credited for the capture and killing of hundreds of Abu Sayyaf fighters and most top leaders since the 1990s.

Jumdail, also known as Dr Abu, had eluded troops in numerous offensives and emerged as a key figure in the radical movement.

Most recently, all three of the militant leaders were among the prime suspects in the kidnappings of three Red Cross workers from Switzerland, Italy and the Philippines in 2009.

The hostages separately regained their freedom months later, reportedly after ransom payments.

The military estimates the strength of Abu Sayyaf militants at about 400. They are still considered a key threat to the regional security.

They are believed to be holding a former Australian soldier who was kidnapped before Christmas as well as a Malaysian, a Japanese and an Indian.

Yesterday, gunmen on nearby Tawi-Tawi island province snatched Dutch and Swiss tourists and officials said they were attempting to move them to Jolo in an impoverished Muslim region 590 miles south of Manila.
