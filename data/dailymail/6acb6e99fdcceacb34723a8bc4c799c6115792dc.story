The after-school activities being chosen by parents say a lot more than you might think about the future they envision for their daughters.

When choosing activities for elementary school girls, families believe choosing either chess, dance or soccer puts their daughters on specific paths for future success, with each lending itself to traits prized by different segments of the population, according to a recent study.

This finding was the result of interviews conducted with 38 families over a 16-month period, the families were a subset of the over 200 families interviewed for the book Playing to Win: Raising Children in a Competitive Culture.

Future executive: Soccer is seen by upper-class parents as providing their daughters a path to the corner office

In setting out to define how children’s activities are associated with their feminine or masculine identity, author Hilary Levey Friedman interviewed 200 families on what  after-school activities their children take part in and how parents feel that puts the wheels in motion for a more successful future. In post on The Atlantic’s website, she chose to focus on the segment of families with elementary school-aged girls.

Friedman’s findings, based on the girls’ parents’ own words, placed these young girls into three categories – ‘aggressive,’ ‘graceful’ and ‘pink,’ which she said defined the girls’ ‘gender scripts.’ She questioned the 38 families across three urban settings and three rural settings.

Aggressive girls, as defined by their 
parents, tended to be steered into soccer, according to Friedman. Soccer 
moms tended to come from upper-class families with white collar jobs 
ranging from doctors to investment bankers and lawyers, Friedman noted.

‘Aggressive girls are taught to be both physically and competitively forceful, actively subsuming aspects of their femininity,’ wrote Friedman. These girls are encouraged to de-emphasize physical femininity and cultivate a winning attitude – to prepare them for future executive positions.

‘I encourage her to be more aggressive because she's a cute little girl, but I don't like her to be a girly girl,’ one father said to Friedman, adding ‘you know, I don't want her to be a cheerleader--nothing against that, but I want her to prepare to have the option, if she wants to be an executive in a company, that she can play on that turf.’

Being overly feminine is seen as being a disadvantage by this parent, who worried his daughter would become a secretary if she was too much of a ‘girly girl.’

Give me an N! Give me an O!: Upper class parents feel that cheerleading, while okay, makes their daughters more likely to be an executive assistant than an executive, according to Hilary Levey Friedman

Grace and etiquette: Young girls participating in competitive dance are more likely to be considered graceful and polite, which makes them moe desirable mates, according to their parents

Not nearly as focused on their daughters’
careers as their more well-to-do counterparts, lower-class parents 
encouraged their girls to enrol in competitive dance – which 
specifically emphasizes feminine qualities such as grace and etiquette.

Dance competitions tend to have very supportive atmospheres, parents told Friedman. In addition to the focus placed on appearance – hair, makeup, cleanliness – the girls are encouraged to find at least one way to encourage or compliment their competitors.  These situations prepare girls for futures in ways upper-class parents shun.

Grace and etiquette are equated with femininity, which blue collar parents tend to feel makes their daughters more desirable and likely to be married. Marriage and family are seen as more important to lower-class families Friedman spoke to, as opposed to the corner office often prized by the upper class.

The one activity seen by parents to 
embrace both the competitive, warrior-like nature of soccer, and the 
femininity of competitive dance was scholastic chess. Even more 
importantly some parents told Friedman, ‘they beat boys.’

Pink warriors: Young girls learn more about equality playing scholastic chess, they also even learn they can beat boys

Susan
Polger, the female chess grandmaster, told Levin that chess not being 
physical is the point, that equality can be achieved in many ways.

‘I think girls need to understand that, yes, they have equal potential to boys. I think that chess is a wonderful tool as an intellectual activity, where girls can prove that unlike in physical sports, because by nature maybe boys are stronger or faster, in chess women can prove equal.’

These activities, Friedman wrote, are symbolic of what parents want for their children. From maintaining upper-class social status to preparing one’s self for being a good wife, after-school activities matter.

‘Gender and class are being reproduced in these competitive activities, which will likely impact who ends up in that corner office and who ends up as the boss's assistant,’ Friedman wrote.

That is, unless you’re the father of one boy beaten by a ‘pink warrior.’

‘A chess mom described [to Friedman] how a father reacted negatively when his son lost to her daughter: "The father came out and was shocked. He said, 'You let a girl beat you!'
