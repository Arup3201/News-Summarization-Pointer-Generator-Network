'Bright young star': Promising scientist Katharine Giles, 35, was killed in a road accident this week

A brilliant young climate scientist was this week crushed to death by a truck while cycling to work through Central London.

Katharine Giles, who has presented her work to MPs, was killed by the massive vehicle as it made a left turn in rush hour traffic near Victoria Station on Monday morning.

Dr Giles was a researcher and lecturer at University College London, recently named the fourth best university in the world.

The 35-year-old last year addressed 
politicians on the problems of fresh water storage in the Arctic, which 
was one of the focuses of her research.

She had worked at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at UCL since taking her PhD from the university in 2005.

It
is the second tragedy to hit the department in 2013, after its director
Seymour Laxon died of a brain haemorrhage when he fell down a flight of
stairs in the early hours of New Year's Day.

Dr
Giles, who worked closely with him and had been tipped to become his 
successor, took over some of his research after his death and had 
published papers in a number of prestigious journals.

Her
work included exploring the link between wind flow and melting ice, and
she was awarded a fellowship from the Natural Environment 
Research Council.

Horrific: Dr Giles's mangled bicycle lying in the road near Victoria station in Central London on Monday morning

The head of Dr Giles's department, Philip Meredith, said: 'It is with great sadness that I can confirm that our talented friend and colleague, Katharine Giles, died in a road traffic accident while cycling to work on Monday of this week.

'Coming so soon after the accidental death of Katharine's own closest colleague, Seymour Laxon, we are all left with a sense of the outrageous unfairness with which some of our best colleagues have been taken from us.

'Katharine had a bright future ahead of her. She graduated with a first-class degree in Earth and Space Sciences from UCL, studied under Seymour for her PhD, and went on to forge her own career as a Research Fellow and most recently as a University Lecturer.

'We greatly admired the bravery and sense of purpose with which she took on the many commitments in CPOM following Seymour's demise, and it was clear that she was ready to provide the next generation of leadership in that field.

'This makes it all the more difficult for us to accept that Katharine won't now have the opportunity to reach the heights she was sure to achieve.'

Scene: The road was closed to traffic after the accident involving a truck which was turning left

Friends and colleagues immediately took to Twitter following the crash to pay tribute to Dr Giles, with Mel Sandells writing: 'Devastated. A bright young star has been lost'.

Katy Wilson added: 'UCL Earth Sciences tragically lost another brilliant young scientist when Katharine Giles was knocked down & killed. Awful 24 hrs'.

Dr Giles was the second cyclist to die in London this year, and after her death Boris Johnson threatened to ban HGVs from central London unless they are fitted with cycle-safety measures such as special mirrors .

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'The male driver of the HGV lorry stopped at the scene. He was not arrested.'
