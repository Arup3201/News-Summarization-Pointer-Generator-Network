Mike Ashley is considering Alan Pardew’s future from his holiday home in Barbados after being told the Newcastle manager wants to quit St James’ Park.

Pardew, who ducked the post match press conference after the dramatic 3-2 victory against Everton on Sunday, hopes he will be allowed to leave by mutual consent to join Crystal Palace.

Despite a fixed £5million compensation clause in his contract, which still has six years to run, he will appeal to the Newcastle owner's compassionate side to let him walk away from the club after four years in charge.

Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club

Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals.

The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season.

Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match).

The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay.

Pardew played every minute of both matches.

Pardew has faced various campaigns calling for his resignation or dismissal by sections of supporters throughout his turbulent reign at the club.

Ashley, who did not attend the victory over Everton on Sunday, is plotting his next move from his holiday retreat.

The billionaire is wary of the upheaval if he allows his manager to quit the club and will also need to find a replacement prepared to work under his demanding ways.

Ashley could yet play hardball and demand the £5m compensation from Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, but the Eagles are unlikely to agree to that.

Pardew is known to be frustrated after being told at a transfer meeting held around four weeks ago that there will not be any money to spend in January.

Instead there is the possibility that Moussa Sissoko will leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest in the France midfielder.

Newcastle are ninth in the Barclays Premier League following the victory over Everton and Ashley is happy with the team’s progress following their poor start to the season.

Pardew, who wants to progress and challenge for honours, expected Ashley to make funds available to strengthen the team.

Instead the Newcastle owner, who has an excellent relationship with his manager, appears content with the current squad.

Pardew, who joined Palace in the Eighties and went on to score the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990, is currently at his family home in Surrey waiting for Ashley to make his move.

Pardew chose not to speak to the press following Sunday’s 3-2 win over Everton and he would have been aware that such a stance would fuel speculation linking him with a return to south east London.

He returned south on Sunday night after Newcastle’s 3-2 victory over Everton, but is expected to be at the training ground on Tuesday morning as things stand. 

His first team players were given the day off after a hectic Christmas schedule, but the rest of the squad - including non-playing substitutes - reported for work.

Pardew's press conference previewing the New Year's Day visit of Burnley - scheduled for Tuesday - is still planned to go ahead. 

Crystal Palace are stepping up their search to replace former boss Neil Warnock
