Amy Pascal's office move has been delayed because of a stench of marijuana permeating the building, sources close to the disgraced Sony executive say.

They told The Hollywood Reporter that the odor was left behind by funnymen Seth Rogen and his frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg, as they occupied the space for a short time.

Pascal, 56, whose controversial emails were leaked during the hacking scandal, is set to head up her own production company as part of her leaving package.

Up in smoke: Amy Pascal's office move has been delayed because of a stench of marijuana permeating the building, sources close to the disgraced Sony executive say

The new job role - with a four-year contract - is said to be worth between $30 million and $40 million.

The exact location of her new base is not known but it is set to be somewhere in the heart of Hollywood.

She will reportedly move into temporary offices until the odor of marijuana sufficiently eliminated. 

The scent has apparently soaked into flooring and brickwork but nothing a lick of paint won't solve.

Source of the problem? The odor was reportedly left behind by funnymen Seth Rogen and his frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg, as they occupied the space for a short time

In an interview last month, Amy Pascal opened up about her departure and acknowledged it wasn't voluntary.

Speaking to journalist Tina Brown at the Women in the World conference in San Francisco, Pascal joked, 'All the women here are doing incredible things in this world. All I did was get fired."

After a long reign as the head of Sony Pictures, the studio announced Pascal was stepping down and would start a new production venture at Sony. 

In her new role as producer, she has already inherited several of the studio's biggest upcoming projects, including Sony's next Spider-man film, to be made in partnership with Marvel Studios.
