West Brom boss Tony Pulis admits he takes great pride in Stoke's success under Mark Hughes because his successor is reaping the benefits of his own work at the Britannia Stadium.

Pulis welcomes his former club to the Black Country on Saturday hoping to break Stoke's 100 per cent winning record at The Hawthorns.

While the Baggies head into the match on the back of two frustrating defeats to local rivals Aston Villa in league and cup action, Stoke are looking for a fourth successive win and sit eighth in the Barclays Premier League.

Tony Pulis admits he takes pride in seeing Stoke's success in the Premier League this season 

While Pulis stopped short of claiming the credit for Stoke's current success, the Welshman was happy to point out his influence in their squad.

'The great thing for me about the club is that you leave it in a condition where it can grow and grow and get better,' he said.

'Look at the players who are there, the backbone of that football club, like Glenn Whelan, Ryan Shawcross, Asmir Begovic, Steven N'Nonzi, Peter Crouch, Jon Walters, just a few to mention. 

'Marc Wilson, Geoff Cameron, wonderful people and wonderful professionals, and it's really nice when you take over a club with all good professionals like that.'

He added: 'How many players has Mark brought in?

'I don't know but the majority of the lads who were there before still seem to be picked week-in week-out, that's testament to them as individuals to win over a new manager.

Pulis takes credit for the 'backbone' of the Stoke side, which includes Ryan Shawcross (above)  

'Glenn Whelan and Ryan Shawcross are the only ones who were there when we got promoted from the Championship.

'They've been brilliant. And they've been brilliant for the football club.'

Albion have doubts over strikers Saido Berahino, Brown Ideye and Victor Anichebe for the clash.

Berahino and Ideye have been playing through the pain barrier recently while Anichebe has a groin problem. Winger Callum McManaman has a foot injury which boss Tony Pulis has decided to rest for a few weeks.
