Hardworking families are being forced to pay up to £528 extra in council tax every year to cover the cost of those who fail to pay their bills.

New figures show the total sum left uncollected last year totalled £2.4billion, a new record, with Liverpool council the worst offender in allowing £114million to slip through its fingers.

With every penny that goes uncollected adding to a higher bill for law-abiding families, the average UK council tax bill now includes a £102 tax-dodger subsidy.

Subsidy: Hardworking families pay up to £528 extra in council tax every year to cover the cost of those who fail to pay their bills. Every penny that goes uncollected adds to a higher bill for law-abiding citizens

Nine of the ten worst offenders are Labour-run councils, many of whom complain about problems caused by government budget cuts while simultaneously allowing tens of millions of pounds to vanish through council tax dodges.

The country’s total council tax arrears has risen 25 per cent in five years.

By far the worst offender is Liverpool 
council, who in 2013 allowed a staggering £114m to go unpaid – leaving 
the average household paying an extra £528 a year simply to counter the 
cost of people failing to pay their bills.

Liverpool - £114m, adds £528 to average bill

Hackney - £41.8m, adds £403 to average bill

Haringey - £32.6m, adds £313 to average bill

Hounslow - £29.7m, adds £306 to average bill

Lambeth - £38m, adds £284 to average bill

Islington - £28.1m, adds £277 to average bill

Croydon - £40m, adds £271 to average bill

Lewisham - £31.8m, adds £268 to average bill

Newham - £27.8m, adds £265 to average bill

Enfield - £32.1m, adding £264 to average bill

This is despite Liverpool’s mayor Joe Anderson recently warning that government funding cuts could lead to riots in the city.

Outside Liverpool, the top ten councils with the worst collection rates are all in London.

Labour-run Hackney council failed to collect a total of £41.9 million last year, adding £403 to an average household’s council tax bill, while Haringey allowed £32.6 million to disappear, forcing families to fork out an extra £313 each.

Hounslow came in fourth place nationwide, with the total £29.7 million uncollected adding a £306 subsidy to a typical council tax bill.

The likes of Croydon and Lambeth councils appear slightly further down the list  thanks to a large population bringing down the average added to taxpayers’ bills, but they were easily among the worst offenders in terms of total money left uncollected.

Croydon allowed £40million to slip through its fingers last year, while Lambeth let tax dodgers off without paying a total of £38million.

In contrast, the best performing council in the country is Conservative-run Amber Valley in Derbyshire, where only £718,0o0 went unpaid, adding an average subsidy of just £13 per household.

Speaking to the Sun, local government minister Brandon Lewis said: 'Every penny not collected means a higher bill for the law-abiding citizen who does pay on time.'
