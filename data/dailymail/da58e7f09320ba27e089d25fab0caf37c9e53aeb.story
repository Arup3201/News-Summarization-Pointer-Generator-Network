The cost of the most expensive West End theatre ticket has tripled over the past ten years, new research has revealed.

The highest price for a theatre seat is currently the £152.25 charged for The Book of Mormon at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London.

This is 20 per cent higher than the £127 price charged for the satirical musical last year, according to a survey by the actors' newspaper The Stage.

This new premium seat price is more than three times the amount charged for a similar West End show in 2004.

The top rate then was the £49 charged for The Producers.

The second most expensive seats for The Book of Mormon are now £127.50 - more than double the rate of a year ago, the survey found.

The average price of a theatre ticket is now £99.78 - up from £95.09 last year.

The survey also discovered that average prices for customers wishing for the best seats at West End plays have also risen from £78.24 last year to £80.45 this year.

The shift in prices comes despite a crackdown by advertising watchdogs on extra fees being charged on tickets.

Extra fees, which are charges not immediately made clear to theatregoers when they begin booking, have dropped to an average of just 32p - down from £1.12 last year.

Jonathan Brown, chief executive of the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, explained that the drop does not mean fees are disappearing.

He said the decrease was the result of ticket companies abiding by the Committee of Advertising Practice's regulations, which were revised last year to make sure firms disclose fees from the start.

He said: 'We know from the growth of the ticket resale market that customers are prepared to pay a high price for sought-after tickets, and the premium prices we see for some shows are a reflection of that.

'As the technology, science and commercial wisdom behind dynamic pricing find their place in theatre ticketing systems, there is no doubt we are going to see an increase in flexible pricing models in the next few years.'
