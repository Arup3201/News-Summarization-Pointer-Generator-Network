It hasn't been the best year for Gwyneth Paltrow. In March, the glossy actress 'consciously uncoupled' from Chris Martin and saw him linked to a string of women following the split.

So what does 2015 hold for the  mother-of-two and has she made any New Year's resolutions as she turns over a new leaf?

'You know, I’m not such a New Year’s resolution maker,' she explains. 'Everyday I try to resolve to do the things that I would like to do or be more of the person I would like to be, but I don’t, I don’t make like a big resolution, because I think that’s a way to break a promise to yourself and fail and fail bad.'

Getting into the Christmas spirit: Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, is the face of Boss Ma Vie Pour Femme fragrance and shares her plans for the festive season

Rather than look to the future, the clean-cut actress is focusing on enjoying time with her family over the festive period. 

'I really love spending the holidays anywhere as long as it’s with people that I love,' she said of her Christmas plans.

'I don’t mind if it’s a city Christmas or a country Christmas just as long as I’ve got my people with me.'

Discussing gifting, the actress and author, who recently compiled a present guide featuring diamond-shaped vases and a gold-plated juicer, added: 'When I’m giving gifts I definitely like them to be a surprise, absolutely. And I manage until the end. I’m a good secret keeper.'

Gwyneth, who has a string of A-list friends, will no doubt be hosting a few Christmas parties in the coming weeks.

Sharing her style tips for pulling off the season in style, the fashionista said: 'I think every woman should own a blacktuxedo jacket. It’s so versatile and a really key staple piece in a wardrobe. And if it’s well tailored it’s so feminine while being a strong shape.'

The star, who is the face of Boss Ma Vie Pour Femme fragrance, and smoulders in the new campaign images, explains: 'I would style a tuxedo similar to the way we have done it in the campaign; I love that there’s a white silk scarf with it and very high heels. And the tuxedo is tailored. I like that it’s a low-V so you have some skin; that makes it feminine.'

Big fan: As the face of the brand, she obviously loves the new Boss fragrance, particularly because it represents a time to pause and take a moment, she explains 

Beauty-wise, Gwyneth explains that she prefers an undone, smudgy, smoky eye because, she says, it makes her eyes 'go very blue'.

'It’s a look you see a lot in London. Although for a special occasion I love a strong lip - the Marilyn Monroe colour is beautiful,' said Gwyneth. 

As the face of the brand, she obviously loves the new Boss fragrance - and not just for its scent.

'I love the concept behind it and that it represents a time to pause and take a moment,' she said.

'I have these moments every day when I think how beautiful life is. It’s those moments that are so simple and so pure and that really connect you to your heart.'
