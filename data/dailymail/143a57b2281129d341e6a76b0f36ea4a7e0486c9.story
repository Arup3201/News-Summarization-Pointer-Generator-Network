If you've ever tipped too little in America or finished all your food in China, you may be familiar with the embarrassment that comes with a dining faux pas.

But now a new clever infographic promises to help you sail through fancy dinners on holiday with no problems.

Revealing the dining customs for various countries, website Restaurant Choice released an educational picture series outlining crucial dos and donts.

In Italy, you shouldn't ask for more cheese unless it's explicitly offered - and go for an espresso after

You probably have a handle on what's appropriate at home, but things quickly change when you travel.

What's acceptable behaviour in one place is seen as rude in another, and the illustrated guides seen on My Modern Met prove not only helpful but a fascinating comparison.

The etiquette in China and Japan is to belch and slurp 
through your dinner to show the chef some appreciation, but such behavior would be seen as rude
 in Britain.

Don't leave a tip in Japan and don't cross your chopsticks - but slurp your soup loudly to show appreciation

In France you shouldn't split the bill and you should use bread to help push things onto your fork

Leaving tips can be a minefield - with 
none custom in China and Japan (it's rude to tip!), but around 10 per 
cent expected in European countries like Portugal and Italy.

In India, it's important that you finish your meal. Wasting food is considered extremely disrespectful.

If you're in China, however, leaving a little bit on the plate lets the host know that they gave you enough to eat.

In China belching is seen as a compliment to the chef - but don't eat all your food

In India, people eat with their right hand only, and all food is finished to show respect

A little tip is good in Portugal, but you shouldn't add salt or pepper as it's offensive to the chef

In Thailand sharing is caring, and you dig into every course all at once. Don't be the guy to take the last bite!

And who knew the Italian's were offended by extra cheese?
