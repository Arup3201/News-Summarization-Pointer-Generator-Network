E! News host Giuliana Rancic has helped a two-time cancer survivor to chop off 45 inches of her hair while live on air during Wednesday’s episode of The Rachael Ray Show.

Giuliana, who was herself diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, was given the honor of making the first snip from 59-year-old Charley’s hair, before calling on a team of stylists to help her transform the previously lengthy locks into a chic bob.

Charley’s decision to cut her hair, which previously extended all the way down to her thighs, was especially emotional, as she has spent the last nine years growing her hair back after losing it all while undergoing chemotherapy treatment in 2005.

Charley said that the loss was 'devastating' because she'd always taken pride in her lengthy locks.

'People know me by my long hair; it's a trademark,' she explained. 'I couldn't face the world without my hair. My crowning glory was gone; my self-esteem was gone; my confidence was gone. I lost more than just my hair when I lost my hair.'

Charley's first bout with the disease came at age 23, when she was diagnosed with uterine cancer.

The long and short of it: The 59-year-old hadn't had a haircut in nearly a decade

Although she didn't lose her hair during that treatment, it led to a life-changing meeting with a young girl in a children's cancer ward, who said her greatest wish was to have long hair like Charley's.

'They could've shaved my head in that moment and I would've handed her my hair,' she recalled of the heartbreaking moment.

From then on, Charley donated her her hair to children with cancer every few years up until her second diagnosis nine years ago.

Youthful look: 'This is reminiscent of my thirties,' Charley told Ms Ray and Ms Rancic of the new hairdo

Charley told Ms Rancic, who underwent a double mastectomy after her diagnosis, that she was ready for her first haircut in nearly a decade.

The 40-year-old TV personality chopped off Charley's ponytail, announcing that a team of professional stylists from New York City's Cutler Salon was waiting backstage to finish the job.

When it was time for the big reveal, Charley stepped out in a sleek, modern bob, gasping as she saw her stunning reflection in an oversize mirror.

'This is reminiscent of my thirties, and I'd like to go back there,' she said.
