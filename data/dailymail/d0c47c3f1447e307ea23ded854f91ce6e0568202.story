Inflation has risen for the first time in 10 months, dashing hopes of an early end to the squeeze on family incomes.

Travel firms bumping up plane and ferry ticket prices by a fifth for the Easter holidays were a major factor in the rise in the Consumer Prices Index to 1.8 per cent.

Latest figures show annual wage increases were stuck at 1.7 per cent, meaning incomes are still being outstripped by the rising cost of living.

The rise in inflation to 1.8 per cent means prices are still rising faster than wages, which are up by 1.7 per cent

Today’s figures are the first rise in CPI since June 2013. The Office for National Statistics said: ‘This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in April 2013 would have cost £101.80 in April 2014.’

A sharp rise in transport costs was by far the largest factor for the increase in overall prices, the ONS said.

‘Prices, overall, increased between March and April 2014, compared with a fall between the same two months a year earlier.

‘Air fares and sea fares were the two largest contributors to the rise, with prices increasing by 18 per cent and 22 per cent on the month respectively.

‘This compares with a fall of 6 per cent and a rise of 3 per cent for air fares and sea fares on the month a year ago. The timing of Easter was likely a factor in both cases.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband was put on the spot about his own finances

Ed Miliband was today accused on live TV of being out of ‘touch with reality’ after underestimating his family's weekly food shopping bill.

The Labour leader, who has attacked the government over the cost of living, claimed he spent around £70 or £80 a week on groceries.

But he appeared taken aback when told the average bill for a family of four is more than £100, as he claimed his £140,000 salary meant he was ‘relatively comfortably off’.

Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband claimed the ‘cost-of-living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and I am determined we tackle it’.

But he was put on the spot about how much it really costs to feed a family of four. Asked about the average weekly household grocery bill, Mr Miliband responded: ‘It depends on how much you are spending.’

Pressed on his own family's bill, Mr Miliband said: ‘We probably spend £70, £80 a week on groceries at least, probably more than that.

‘The point is that different families will have different costs that they face but what I am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many people.’

But TV presenter Susannah Reid took him to task for appearing out of touch.

She told him: ‘The average weekly bill for a family of four is more than £100. So you are going to be spending significantly more than £70 or £80.

‘People will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually talking about something but not in touch with reality.’ 

The cost of clothes and shoes also rose between March and April, having remained flat a year ago.

The price of food and drink fell by 0.5 per cent, with vegetables down after a better growing season this spring.

Ministers had hoped to see wages over-take inflation by now, which would have meant people felt better off each month.

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘'Today's figures are further evidence that our long term plan to fix the economy is working. 

‘Low inflation helps families cope with the cost of living and helps businesses plan for the future.

‘As a result of the Liberal Democrats and our coalition partners taking the difficult decisions needed to stick to the economic plan we are now seeing a pattern of strengthening growth, strong job creation and stable prices.

‘These factors are combining to create the right climate for the increased business confidence and investment that we need to secure this hard earned recovery.'

Experts at Capital Economics said the rise in inflation looked likely to be a ‘blip’ almost entirely reflecting the timing of Easter.

Capital's UK economist Samuel Tombs said the trend should continue to be down over the rest of 2014 as commodity prices stabilise, import prices fall and supermarkets and other retailers step up competition.

He said: ‘We continue to think that CPI inflation should ease to as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain comfortably below the 2 per cent target in 2015.’

But James Knightley, of ING Bank, said there were tentative signs of wages picking up, with momentum building over the coming year and good indications of hiring intentions.

‘In an environment of firm economic growth and strengthening corporate pricing power we feel that CPI will gradually grind higher over coming quarters,’ he said.

The Bank of England said last week that it expected inflation to remain at or below its 2 per cent target for the next few years, easing pressure on it to hike interest rates.

It has been helped by a 10 per cent rise in the value of sterling since last year, keeping the cost of imported goods down.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The latest figures show that inflation remains below the target rate and well below half of the peak in September 2011.

‘Lower inflation and rising job numbers show that the Government's long-term plan is working and Britain is coming back.

‘The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is creating a brighter economic future.’
