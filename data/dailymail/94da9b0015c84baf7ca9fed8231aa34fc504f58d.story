It was half past midnight on Saturday when David Moyes made his way to the Real Sociedad team bus after his post-match press conference and admitted: ‘Normally I would have watched Match of the Day and gone to bed by now.’

One of the culture shocks for anyone new to La Liga is that just as the rest of Europe is going to sleep, the Saturday night late kick-off in Spain is just going into injury time.

Moyes had just seen his team secure a point against Deportivo La Coruna. It wasn’t the win Terry Venables, Sir Bobby Robson and Howard Kendall all managed on their La Liga debuts, but it did match the point John Toshack picked up in his first game in charge of Real Sociedad, and he went on to win the Copa del Rey there, so the omens are not all bad.

Real Sociedad had the better of the first half with former Arsenal forward Carlos Vela and one-time QPR midfielder Esteban Granero both going close.

The visitors didn’t have it all their own way, though, and goalkeeper Enaut Zubikarai was called on to keep out efforts from Deportivo left back Luisinho and on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Jose Rodriguez.

Moyes’s side tired after a testing second period, desperately throwing their bodies in front of shots to earn a draw. But Moyes was positive that the 90-minute intensity he demands from his teams will come.

‘Some people might think you will only find the tiki-taka style here but there is an intensity to the Spanish game, too,’ said Moyes (above). ‘You see that with Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona.

As well as moving up the all-time scoring charts during Real Madrid’s 4-0 win, Ronaldo reached 20 league goals before the end of November — becoming the fastest player ever to reach the total, taking just 11 games. 

It was the 11th consecutive game in which he’d scored and at this rate he would finish with around 70 for the season, beating Messi’s record of 50 in 2012-13.

Elsewhere in La Liga, champions Atletico Madrid beat Malaga 3-1 in a fiery encounter at the Vicente Calderon, in which both sides had a man sent off. The result keeps them within four points of top spot.

‘I have some incredibly talented footballers here and the playing style is good, but they also want to play with intensity and pressing and they also don’t have a problem with hitting a longer pass when it is right to do so.’

Progress will become easier as Moyes spends more time with his squad. He admitted after his first game: ‘It is not easy at the start because the players probably aren’t even understanding how I’m shouting their names at the moment.’

He was also looking to the future when he said he hoped to turn several members of his squad into Spain internationals, emulating the success he had with individual players as Everton coach.

At Goodison Park he helped players such as Seamus Coleman, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Leon Osman earn call-ups for their countries, and the Scot said: ‘I would like to think that my reputation for making players better, and in some cases, converting them into internationals, is pretty good.

‘I have some good young players here and the academy here is really good. (Ruben) Pardo is a good young player and Inigo Martinez is another.

Cristiano Ronaldo reached 20 league goals before the end of November becoming the fastest player to do so 

‘My challenge is to turn them into international players in the coming 18 months. I have done it with one or two others so hopefully I can do it with them as well.’

His debut wasn’t quite the winning starts Venables, Robson and Kendall achieved at Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao respectively, though it did represent Real Sociedad’s first clean sheet since April.

It was also memorable from the moment the team plane touched down...and then took off again at La Coruna’s airport on Saturday morning.

‘The weather was so bad the plane couldn’t land — it came down and went back up again twice,’ said Moyes. ‘We ended up having to land at a different airport.’

 PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND 

Lionel Messi breaks records at such a rate that it’s easy to get blasé, but this one really is special. 

His hat-trick in a 5-1 win over Sevilla brought him to 253 goals in 289 league matches, beating Telmo Zarra’s league record of 251.

 Zarrra, whose mark for Athletic Bilbao lasted 59 years, played until he was 36...Messi is 27. Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, with two goals against Eibar on Saturday, moved to 197 La Liga goals — ninth on the all-time list. 

The Real Madrid man is two years Messi’s senior but has achieved his total in around half the time as the Argentine.
