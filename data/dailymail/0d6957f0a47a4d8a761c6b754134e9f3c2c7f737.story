A four-year-old real estate advertisement has emerged revealing the use of Aboriginal people moving out of the area as a selling point for luxurious apartments.

The suburb of Redfern has long been the indigenous heart of Sydney's inner city but since residential development has started taking over the urban goldmine - a website used the fact that there would be less Aboriginal neighbours as a hook for potential buyers.

The shocking ad has sparked outrage from the indigenous community with many describing it as ‘sickening’, ‘despicable' and ‘straight out racism’.

The Great Fortune Investments ad on the website spruiks the fact that Aboriginal people have moved out

However, Developer DeiCorp, who employed Great Fortune Investments (GFI) in 2010 to assist in the sale of the 18 Dei Cota apartments, say they knew nothing about the ad until Tuesday and has since been taken down.

The ad on GFI's website, which primarily targets Asian buyers, talks about the good rental return and convenient location before attempting to lure keen buyers with the fact that they wouldn't have Indigenous Australians as neighbours.

'The aboriginals have already moved out, now Redfern as the last virgin suburb close to city, it will have great potential for the capital growth in the near future,' the ad said.

DeiCorp owner Fouad Deiri told Daily Mail Australia that he is mortified about the line and he would never have endorsed the advertisement as he prides himself on his company's relationship with the indigenous community.

'When our office moved here in 2000 the first thing we did was knock on Mick Mundine's door at the Aboriginal Housing Company,' he said.

'We would never do anything to harm that relationship.' 

Mr Deiri, who has not employed GFI for years, said the ad had clearly not been thought through properly.

'It is not in Deicorp's character to condone that - the ad was simply not expressed correctly but we knew nothing about it until yesterday.' 

The ad for the 18 Dei Cota apartments is four years old - the last sale was two and half years ago

DeiCorp has been appointed by the Aboriginal Housing Company's to construct its Pemulwuy Project, a $70 million redevelopment of the  area known as The Block in Redfern.

The project will include student housing and 62 units of affordable housing earmarked for Aboriginal people. 

Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council chief executive Nathan Moran told Daily Mail Australia that he finds it hard to believe that Deicorp were unaware of the advertisement.

'Hopefully Deicorp will be held to account and not just deflecting it on to say it was someone else’s problem,' he said. 'That’s more arrogance than anything to claim that they didn’t know.' 

'We are go gutted as the community rep body for all Aboriginal people in the area that this had been in the public domain for so long – it’s a very deceitful way of doing business in the community.'

Mr Moran said he was horrified by the news that he described as 'deplorable' and 'despicable'.

'I find that unacceptable that someone would be trying to work with our community at the same time as marketing other opportunities based on our community being moved,' he said. 

'It's the most sickening end of trying to work with people in good faith.'

Aboriginal activist, Sol Bellear, described the ad as 'laughable' and 'straight out racism'

Mr Moran is just one of many leaders in the indigneous community expressing outrage about the advertisement.

Long-time Aboriginal activist and lawyer, Sol Bellear, who also lives in Redfern, described the ad as 'laughable' and added that this kind of mentality has been around for years.

'Even changing the names from east Redfern to west Redfern and that sort of stuff - and the funny thing about it is the postcode remains the same and this was before the gentrification,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I don’t know where these developers get off coming up with that – that’s just straight out racism - Redfern is a multi-cultural village - there are people of all colours there'

Mr Bellear insisted that although some Aboriginal people have moved out of the area due to the exorbitant rent - the indigenous community was here to stay.

'Redfern has been the ideological address for Aboriginal people from all over Australia and we don’t intend to move,' he said.

'Anyone who wants to move to Redfern, and the surrounding suburbs, is quite welcome but Aboriginal people will always be there - so if you don’t like Aboriginal people don’t move there.'

'We are a great mob of people to live with so come and enjoy our company.'  

He also called on Redfern locals to show leadership and be a shining example.

'I would like to throw down that challenge to the residents of Redfern to get rid of those sorts of comments that are out there and become world leaders in race relations.'

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, told The Australian that he was 'sickened' by the advertising, and he called on the company to meet with Aboriginal local community. 

Mr Deira said he had already spoken to the community to explain his stance on the situation.

Warren Mundine, the head of the Prime Minister’s Indigenous Advisory Council, told The Australian that the suburb's indigenous history should be 'honoured not trashed'.
