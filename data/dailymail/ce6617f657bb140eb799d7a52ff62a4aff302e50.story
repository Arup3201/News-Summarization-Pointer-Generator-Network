A 15 year-old-boy was allegedly strip-searched by staff at a Chicago high school, and as a result, his parents are now suing the entire school district for violating their son's human rights.

The boy claims he was taken from detention by two security guards to a nearby toilet where he was ordered to stand against the wall whilst the male officer strip-searched him, and the female watched.

The boy’s parents are suing the two guards, a Chicago police officer and an assistant principal, the school and its governing body, Chicago Public Schools.

Lawsuit: The 15-year-old's parents Michelle and Anthony Woodman are suing everyone involved including the security officers who carried out the search and Chicago Public Schools' governing body

Anthony and Michelle Woodman are outraged after what allegedly happened to their teenage son and claim he has been traumatised since the event.

‘He came home crying. So I asked him why,’ Mr Woodman told CBS2. ‘He was hysterical. He tells me he’s been strip-searched.’

The 15-year-old was serving an ‘in school suspension’ in a designated room at William Howard Taft High School in Chicago last month.

He says the male and female security guards  took him to a boys toilet where they told him they had received an anonymous tip and were looking for drugs.

The Chicago police officer put him against the wall of a bathroom stall with his back against them.

Abused: The boy, interviewed anonymously, claims he was asked to pull down his pants after which his privates were searched for drugs in front of the female assistant principal

‘He searched me with my clothes on,’ the boy told CBS2. ‘Then he told me to remove my belt. As I undid my belt he pulled my pants and underwear down to my knees and then started grabbing and searching my privates.’

No drugs were found on the boy.

The teen has a history of suspensions and bad behaviour and he requires special education due to ‘emotional disorder’ and a learning disability diagnosed by the school.

A spokeswoman for Chicago Public School said their policy is that ‘under no circumstances are strip searches of students allowed on CPS premises’ and that their school policy manual prohibits ‘washroom searches.’

His parents’ lawsuit claims that the boy’s civil rights were violated and that the search was carried out without cause.

‘No one should go through what our son went through,’ his mother said, whilst Mr Woodman added: ‘There needs to be consequences for what they did to him.’

Julie Herrera, the Woodman’s attorney called the search outrageous.

‘Having a 15-year-old boy have to have a woman – an older woman – watch him with his pants down, while he is touched by another man. I think is horribly humiliating and embarrassing.’

Michelle Woodman said her son’s behaviour has changed dramatically and that he has taken to sleeping with his clothes on and suffers from nightmares.

His mother said the experience was humiliating for her son, and that it has adversely affected him.

‘He is very withdrawn and very angry. He’s depressed. He is just not the same person,’ she said in the CBS2 interview.

Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Police Department declined to comment on an on-going investigation.
