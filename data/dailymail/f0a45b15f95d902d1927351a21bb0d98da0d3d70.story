An 18-year-old teen has been arrested and charged with three counts of burglary after chilling home surveillance footage showed him break into a home and then watched a baby boy in his crib as his parents slept.

Christopher Gomez, was arrested on Thursday night in Katy, Texas, just outside Houston, the same town where he broke into the home of the Le family in the early morning hours on April 5.

Gomez was picked up by police on other outstanding warrants.

In court on Friday, he admitted he is the man in the home surveillance video seen creepily peering in the baby's crib. He also admitted to breaking into two other homes the same night.

The magistrate issued a $250,000 bond for each of the three burglary of a habitation charges.

'I feel relieved that this person is in custody. He should move on and 
do better with his life,' the baby's father, Thinh Le, told KPRC.

Gomez has a rap sheet. He has been convicted of stealing a car and marijuana possession in the past.

Chilling: He can be seen pausing to look over the sleeping boy and pointing a flash light in his direction

Gomez can be seen 
pointing a flashlight towards the two-year-old boy after coming across 
his crib in the home in Flint Hill Drive in Katy.

After
 briefly pausing while looking down at the little boy, Gomez then 
turned away and continued looking through the home for items, eventually
 leaving with a laptop.

'As soon as I knew we'd been broken into, I went upstairs and checked him right away and I kissed him so hard,' the boy's relieved father Thinh Lee told KTRK.

Thinh Le, the father of the boy, said that Gomez should 'move on and do better with his life'

Gomez, climbed into the family's home through a first-story window that had been left unlocked.

Le said he believes the teen knew he was being filmed because he sometimes looked towards the cameras but continued anyway.

Relief: The teen, who has not been caught, turns his back to the crib and continues through the house

'Theft': He finds the homeowners' laptop computer, which was later found on a neighbor's lawn
