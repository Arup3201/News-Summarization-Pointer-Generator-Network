An Indian official has mocked questions over the gang rape and murder of two teenage girls telling journalists 'What's it to you?'

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made the comments as police announced they had made a fifth arrest in the case, which saw the two girls attacked and then hanged from a tree in the state.

It has also been revealed that two police officers have also been fired for failing to investigate when one of the girl's fathers reported them as missing.

Sheer horror: Two teenage girls were found hanging from a tree in Katra village in Uttar Pradesh after they were allegedly raped and killed by a gang of men - including at least one police officer

'Then why are you worried? What's it to you?' he added.

Officers Malik says the fifth arrest in the case came early today with police facing growing criticism for a series of rapes in Uttar Pradesh state, which has a long reputation for lawlessness.

The three other men arrested are cousins in their 20s from an extended family, and face murder and rape charges, they added.

But in a country with a long history of tolerance for sexual violence, the firings yesterday and the minister's comments were not a surprise to many in India.

Last month Mr Yadav's father, a former chief minister and head of the state's ruling party also told an election rally that the party opposed a law calling for gang rapists to be executed.

'Boys will be boys,' Mulayam Singh Yadav said. 'They make mistakes.'

Kavita Krishnan, a women's rights activist, said such comments make clear to police that rape isn't taken seriously by officials.

She called the chief minister' comments 'a trivialisation of rape.'

The gang rape, with video of the girls' corpses hanging from a mango tree and swaying gently in a breeze, was the top story Friday on India's relentless 24-hour news stations.

Official statistics say about 25,000 
rapes are committed every year in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people.
 But activists say that number is very low, since women are often 
pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual assaults.

Indian
 police and politicians, who for decades had done little about sexual 
violence, have faced growing public anger since the December 2012 
gang-rape and murder of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus, an 
attack that sparked national outrage over the treatment of women.

On Friday, the state's former chief minister lashed out at the ruling government.

Outrage: The attack is the latest of a string of appalling rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent years sparking protests across the country

Mayawatie, who only uses one name said: 'There is no law and order in the state. It is the law of the jungle.

Hours
 later, the chief minister ordered that suspects in the attack be tried 
in special "fast track" courts, to get around India's notoriously slow 
judicial system.

The girls, who were 14 and 15, were raped in the tiny village of Katra, about 180 miles from Lucknow.

Police say they disappeared Tuesday night after going into fields since their house has no toilet.

The father of one girl went to police that night to report them missing, but he said they refused to help.

When
 the bodies were discovered the next day, angry villagers silently 
protested the police inaction by refusing to allow the bodies to be cut 
down from the tree.

The villagers allowed authorities to take down the corpses after the first arrests were made on Wednesday.

The girls were Dalits, from the community once known as "untouchables" in India's ancient caste system.

While
 sexual assaults are reported across India, there have been a string of 
high-profile attacks in just the past few days in Uttar Pradesh.

On Thursday, police arrested three men for brutally attacking the mother of a rape victim after she refused to withdraw her complaint.

The attack, in the town of Etawah, followed the May 11 rape of the woman's teenage daughter. A local man was arrested after the mother filed a complaint with authorities.

Five men - including the father, a brother and a cousin of the man accused in the rape - followed the victim's mother away from her house on Monday and beat her relentlessly, demanding she drop the accusation, he said.Â 

Dinesh Kumar, the town's police superintendent. The mother was in critical condition in a hospital, with numerous broken bones and internal injuries.

Police arrested three men Thursday for the attack and were looking for two others.

On Wednesday, a 17-year-old woman was attacked in a field and raped by four men in south western Uttar Pradesh, police said. One man has been arrested.
