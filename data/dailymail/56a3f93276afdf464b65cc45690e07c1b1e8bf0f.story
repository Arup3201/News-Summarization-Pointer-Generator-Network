A man has
been accused killing two of his mother's pet ChihuahuasÂ  - because she
loved them more than him.

Adam Kosa
is alleged to have slit the throats of the animals with a box cutter. Two other
dogs had their throats slit but survived.

The 23-year-old was found on the porch of the home in Melbourne, Florida, drenched in
blood, according to WTSP. Police claim
he spared two of the miniature dogs.

An arrest
report cited by the station revealed that Kosa said after killing one of the dogs he got an 'adrenalin rush' and chased after and caught another three.

Kosa allegedly said
he began to feel guilty about slaughtering the animals and spared two from a
grisly death.

He also allegedly told
detectives he was jealous that his mother paid more attention to her six dogs
than him.

After the
killing, deputies say Kosa walked to a 7-Eleven where he encountered a family
friend and confessed.

He returned

and two severely injured, police told the station.

Family
members took the two injured dogs to a hospital, deputies reported they were in
stable condition.

Kosa was
arrested and charged with four counts of felony cruelty to the animals.

He is
being held at Brevard County Jail on a $20,000 bond.
