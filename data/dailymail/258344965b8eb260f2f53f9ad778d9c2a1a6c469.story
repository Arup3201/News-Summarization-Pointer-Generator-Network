A Connecticut photographer whose twin brother was born with cerebral palsy uses the camera lens to help come to terms with being born the healthy twin.

Christopher Capozziello has documented his brother Nick’s life and its struggles for the last thirteen years and the collection of black and white photos will soon be published as a book.

The collection, titled The Distance Between Us, is both a brother’s touching tribute and Capozziello’s attempt to come to terms with the reality his brother lives and one from which he happened to be spared.

Twins: The Distance Between Us is Chris Capozziello's attempt to sort out what it means to be the twin who was born healthy

‘The question I always asked myself as a child, and even sometimes now as an adult, is why did this happen to Nick and not me,’ Capozziello writes on a Kickstarter campaign page dedicated to help get his book published. ‘Why does this happen to anyone? The pictures ended up forcing me to deal with these questions.’

Capozziello has happily reached a fundraising goal of $16,000 and has stretched his goal to $25,000. Along with Austria-based publisher Lammerhuber, Capozziello is hoping to offset the cost of telling his story in book form.

‘For years,’ writes Capozziello, ‘I archived the pictures without ever looking at many of them. About ten years after the first pictures were made, and with a growing pile of photographs, I started to question why I continued to make these pictures.’

Looking for answers? Capozziello's brother Nick, pictured, was born with cerebral palsy while Capozziello was born healthy and The Distance Between Us asks the questions, Why?

In The Distance Between Us, Capoziello documents his brother's ups and downs in stark black and white

The photos primarily focus on Nick. He's seen struggling to perform everyday tasks, but also triumphing in ways large and smalll

Thus was born The Distance Between us.

Photos of Nick are as uplifting as they are unflinching in their portrayal of Nick’s reality, one in which painful cramps and struggles to perform everyday tasks are commonplace.

Whether his brother is lighting a pretty girl’s cigarette or taking communion at church, Capozziello finds a way to convey Nick’s struggles and his triumphs. Though it isn’t Nick’s illness that Capozziello is most interested in.

Painful: The cerebral palsy causes Nick debilitating muscle cramps that can last from hours to days

'Nick's countenance changes when a spasm is coming,' writes Capozziello. 'Even before his body goes rigid.'

'In November 2009, Nick had Brain Stimulation Surgery. 'DBS is cutting edge science but it look like medieval torture,' writes Capozziello

‘It had little to do with showing what it is like to live with cerebral palsy,’ he says, ‘and more to do with sharing our story as brothers, and being open about my laments, and sharing how I began to move past the guilt I carried for being the healthy twin.’

The project has also allowed Capozziello to place his focus on the future.

‘The pictures have unexpectedly begun to help me move past my own grief, past my fears, and past our family to find out what lies ahead for Nick and me,’ he writes. ‘I don’t know how the future will look, but soon it will be just ours to figure out.’

'He understands enough about the world to know what he¿s missing," Capozziello told the New York Times about his brother

'The time I spend with him, looking through my camera, has forced me to ask questions about suffering and faith and why anyone is born with disability,' Capozziello writes

Learning: 'As I spent more and more time with the photographs, I began to see Nick more clearly as an individual, with his own set of wants and desires,' Capozziello says
