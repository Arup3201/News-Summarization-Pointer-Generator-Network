Jerry Sandusky's former daughter-in-law has obtained a legal order barring the ex-Penn State coach from seeing three of his grandchildren.

Jill Jones, who was once married to Matt Sandusky, went to court to stop the accused paedophile from having access to their two daughters, aged nine and seven, and one son, aged five, according to documents.

A Grand Jury indictment alleges Sandusky, 67, sexually abused eight boys, some as young as seven, over a 15-year period. He denies the allegations.

After hearing the horrific charges on November 5, Ms Jones urged her ex-husband to keep the children away from their grandfather, The Daily reported.

Later that day Sandusky's wife Dorothy sent Ms Jones a text message informing her that Matt had taken the children to her State College, Pennsylvania home, but that Sandusky was not present.

Mrs Sandusky also phoned Ms Jones to try to persuade her that the children would be safe around her husband, the documents said, according to The Daily.

Ms Jones was unwavering, though, and successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding the children from sleeping over at their grandparents' home and banning Sandusky from seeing them unsupervised.

Although there is no record that Ms Jones ever accused her ex-father-in-law of abusing her children, there is a 'fundamental disagreement over the validity of the charges against Jerry Sandusky and the risk he poses to children,' the court documents said, according to The Daily.

Sandusky's attorney, Joe Amendola says his client rejects all the allegations set forth in the 23-page indictment.

The news came as it emerged that Matt, one of six now adult children Sandusky and his wife adopted during the course of the lengthy marriage, attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with the couple.

Matt, now 33, came into the Sandusky home through The Second Mile in 1995, after having a troubled childhood in which he had burnt down a barn.

Children and Youth Services placed him with the family at Sandusky's request.

The probation officer, Terry Trude, became concerned about Matt's well-being and mental health and together with his biological mother Debra Long, wrote a letter to Centre County Judge David Grine asking for his living situation to be reviewed, the Patriot-News reported.

However contemporary court records include a letter written by Matt in which he implores the judge to allow him to stay with the family.

'I would like to be placed back with the Sanduskys. I feel that they have supported me even when I have messed up. They are a loving caring group of people. I love both my biological family and the Sandusky family,' he wrote at the time.

Matt is not one of the eight victims in the Grand Jury indictment, but he did testify before the investigative panel at the attorney general’s office in the Strawberry Square complex, Harrisburg,  the Patriot-News reported.

Ms Long said she also testified to the Grand Jury panel, and told them of her son’s change in behaviour after he went to live with Sandusky, according to the Patriot-News.

Mr Amendola countered, saying Long 'never liked Jerry because she saw Jerry as a person who was involved in removing her child from the home.'

Two of Matt’s adopted siblings followed their father into the world of football: Edward Joel, 41, a former Nittany Lions player, and now a football coach at West Chester University and Jon, who is Director of Player Personnel for the Cleveland Browns.

On Monday, Jon went on a leave of absence from the NFL club as the scandal involving his father exploded into the public domain. He and his wife, Kia, have an infant son.

Over the years the Sanduskys also became the parents to Ray, now 46, a photographer and woodturner living in Brentwood, Tennesee, Kara, 38, a Penn State graduate, and Jeff, 35, a former Marine.

In Sandusky's 2000 memoir titled 'Touched', Kara, named Sandusky Werner, wrote in the introduction: 'We were always proud of the things he did for kids.'

On his website, Ray writes: 'I have always been creative and constructive. I can recall painting meaningful images as a child in kindergarten, throwing clay vessels on a wheel in junior high school and performing all manner of assembly and repairs around the house.'

This week has seen people who believed they knew Sandusky come forward to express their shock at the allegations.

'A lot of people look at him as a monster now,' Kip Richeal, who co-authored Touched, told ESPN. 'I would've never, ever thought something like this about him. And how long did it go on? It never happened with me. When I met him, though, I was 18. I wasn't a little boy.

'If this is all true, and it looks like it's really stacking up, something took over his personality. Something changed, and it's not the Jerry I know.'

Meanwhile ex-NFL player Jon Ritchie, who knew Sandusky since he was a 14-year-old, said on ESPN: 'I thought he was the most compassionate, altruistic, selfless man on the face of the planet.

'There were always kids around, Second Mile kids (the charity Sandusky set up and allegedly picked his victims from).

'And these tragedies that are coming out now have brought sports, have brought everyone, to the darkest place. I can’t fathom sports right now. I don’t even care about sports right now. Because this picture of what I thought was good has exploded.'
