A British meat company, which claims to supply schools and restaurants, has been identified as importing large quantities of horse meat.

Flexi Foods, based in Hull, has been named as the key source of consignments of tonnes of beef that illegally included horse meat.

Large blocks of what were supposed to be beef off-cuts were imported by Flexi Foods from Poland and then sold on to food manufacturers in the UK and Ireland.

However, it has now emerged that much of this meat was horse and is likely to have ended up as burgers and ready meals in homes, fast food restaurants, market stalls and, potentially, schools.

A large consignment of meat, where samples were up to 80per cent horse meat, was imported by Flexi Foods and sent to cold storage at Freeza Meats, northern Ireland.

Flexi Foods also supplied 60 tonnes of beef, some of which is known to have been horse meat, to McAdam Foods, in southern Ireland, during 2012.

It sold this on to Silvercrest, in country Monaghan, who made tainted burgers for Tesco, Burger King, the Co-op and Aldi, among others.

The amount of meat involved suggests tens of millions of tainted burgers were produced during 2012.

News of the British link to the horse meat scandal brought demands for urgent action by the Government and the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

To date, British ministers and the UK food watchdog have largely left the investigation to their counterparts in southern Ireland, who first revealed the contamination three weeks ago.

It now appears that a British food 
company with connections to manufacturers, caterers, schools and market 
stalls across the UK and Ireland had a central role.

Gone: Aldi has withdrawn items from its Today's Special range and Tesco some of its Everyday Value products

Flexi
Foods, which was established in 1994, lists its headquarters as being 
in Hull with other bases in Poznan, Poland and Copenhagen, Denmark.

Its
partner companies include Northern Food Traders, while the firm's 
website boasts: 'Northern Food Traders was established to service the 
catering side like restaurants, schools and market traders.

'With
our modern storage facilities in Middlewitch and our refrigerated vans,
we have open up a complete new market which we see as being another new
string to our bow.'

The 
company's website says the management have been working in the meat 
trade since 1989 and so have gained a 'reputation for being a reliable 
and trust worthy partner in the meat industry'.

The FSA will be investigating which food manufactures in the UK and beyond were supplied by Flexi Foods.

It
will be keen to establish any links with the British manufacturer, 
Dalepak, which is based nearby in Richmond, Yorkshire. It made burgers 
contaminated with traces of horse meat for Iceland and Aldi.

Careful: Spaghetti bolognese and lasagne were the beef products taking the hit

Labour's shadow food and farming 
Secretary, Mary Creagh MP, called on the government to order urgent 
tests on meat sold in schools, hospitals and other public services.

She wrote a letter to the 
Conservative food and farming Secretary, Owen Paterson, saying: 'The FSA
needs to conduct tests on food supplied to public sector caterers to 
ensure that contaminated meat has not been served in hospitals and 
schools.

'What guarantees 
can you give that no adulterated meat has gone into school or hospital 
food, or been supplied to other caterers in the public sector?'

She warned consumer confidence in processed meat is being severely undermined.

McAdam Foods insists it was shocked to be told that the meat supplied by Flexi Foods contained horse.

It
said: 'The company, its management and staff are shocked and astonished
to discover that equine content has been identified in products which 
have been imported and supplied through McAdam Foods.'

Flexi Foods passed enquiries to its lawyers who did not respond to a request for a comment.

It
has emerged that ready meal packs of lasagne made in France for the 
Findus brand have been withdrawn from UK shops because of concerns they 
may contain horse meat.

At the same time, Tesco and Aldi removed packs of frozen ready meals which were made by the same French supplier - Comigel.

Tesco
said: 'Following the withdrawal of Findus beef lasagne, which is 
produced by Comigel(correct), we have decided to withdraw our frozen 
Everyday Value Spaghetti Bolognese, which is produced at the same site, 
as a precautionary measure.

'There
is no evidence that our product has been contaminated and the meat used
in the Findus product is not used in our product. However, we have 
decided to withdraw the product pending the results of our own tests.'

Aldi
said: 'Following an alert from our French supplier, Comigel, Aldi 
immediately withdrew its Today's Special Frozen Beef Lasagne and Today's
Special Frozen Spaghetti Bolognese from stores as a precautionary 
measure.

'Comigel has flagged concerns that the products do not conform to specification.'

Findus
UK said: 'The supplier that produces Findus Beef Lasagne has informed 
us that they have a labelling issue and have asked us to withdraw the 
affected product.

'We are also currently conducting a full re-assessment of our supplier's sourcing.'

Findus UK said it withdrew its 320g, 
360g and 500g lasagne meals as a precautionary measure.

The company insisted it was not a food safety issue.

'Deserving consumers' trust is a key 
priority for us,' said a Findus UK spokesman. 'As part of that 
commitment, we have been constantly reviewing our supply chain.'

The decisions by Aldi and Tesco come 
on the same day that Asda removed four own-brand frozen burger products 
from sale following the discovery of beef contaminated with horsemeat at
a manufacturer in Northern Ireland.

Asda
also described the move as a 'precautionary measure', made despite 
assurances from food watchdogs that it was not necessary.

It
followed revelations that a consignment of beef that contained up to 80
per cent horsemeat had been found at a cold store operated by Freeza 
Meats of Newry.
