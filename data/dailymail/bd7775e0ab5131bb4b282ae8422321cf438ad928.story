Self-confessed conman Peter Foster - the Australian former friend of Cherie Blair during the notorious Cheriegate Affair - has been revealed as 'the puppeteer' behind a slimming product scam.

The 51-year-old fraudster, who became infamous in the UK in 2002 when he helped Mrs Blair purchase two flats in Bristol at a discounted price, was found by a judge to be guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct.

But he wasn't in the Federal Court in Brisbane to hear Justice David Yates' condemning comments about his 'secret' involvement in a nasal slimming product, which was found to be a scam.

Verdict: Peter Foster has been found guilty in Australia of misleading and deceptive conduct. He became infamous in the UK in 2002 when he helped Cherie Blair purchase two flats in Bristol at a discounted price

Past: Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry and promoting products that he knew would not work

Foster is currently on an Interpol 'most wanted' list and was last heard of in hiding in the Pacific nation of Fiji.

He has already been sentenced to 
three years jail for contempt of court after breaking a 2005 court order
 barring him from the weight loss industry - and, if caught, he now 
faces further prison time for failing to appear in court and being found
 guilty of the slimming con.

Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US 
and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming 
industry and promoting products that he knew would not work.

His gained notoriety in Britain when it was revealed he had been an unofficial financial adviser to Cherie Blair - wife of then Prime Minister Tony Blair - and had helped to negotiate a low price for her purchase of two flats in Bristol.

Mrs Blair initially distanced herself from Foster and the claims, but email evidence later proved she had in fact called Foster a 'star', before adding: 'We are on the same wave length, Peter'.

She later made a tearful apology blaming her 'misfortune' on the pressures of being a mother, adding: 'I did not think it was my business to choose my friends' friends'.

Apology: In 2002 Cherie Blair made a statement over her links to convicted fraudster Peter Foster. She had earlier sought to distance herself from claims he helped her purchase a house

Relationship: The scandal brought to light how close Peter Foster was with the Blairs - who had agreed to be the godparents of a yet-to-be-born child that was later miscarried

The scandal brought to light how close Foster was with the Blairs - who had agreed to be the godparents of the yet-to-be-born child that his then partner Carole Caplin later miscarried.

Foster even spent the night of his 40th birthday with the Blair's as a guest at 10 Downing Street.

Referring to the slimming product known as SensaSlim, Justice Yates said of Foster: 'He was the puppeteer who pulled all the strings in the operation of the business.'

Finding Foster guilty of a number of allegations of misleading and deceptive conduct brought against him by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the judge said Foster had involved a Melbourne gangland figure and his business associate in the scam.

The judge said that Foster, who variously describes himself as an 'International Man of Mystery' or 'International Man of Mischief', had kept his involvement in the SensaSlim scam secret because of his 'awareness of his own bad reputation.'

Foster was found to have created a fake Swiss research institute with 'false doctors' to promote SensaSlim.

'The individuals said to be employed by the institute as senior medical staff are fictitious,' said the judge. 'The institute is a fabrication.'

And in a further indictment, Justice Yates said that Foster had used Melbourne-based alleged gangster Mike Gatto and Mr Gatto's business associate John Khoury to resolve a 2010 dispute with SensaSlim sales head Scott Emerton.

'I'll get my friends from Melbourne involved,' Foster was alleged to have told a Queensland Gold Coast dentist, an investor in SensaSlim.

He was alleged to have said later: 'The problem has been dealt with. Scott will leave Mike alone.'

Whereabouts unknown: Peter Foster is currently on an Interpol 'most wanted' list and was last heard of in hiding in the Pacific nation of Fiji

Further penalties against Foster as a result of today's hearing are to be fixed at a date to be arranged.

Foster has a long history as a notorious conman, the majority of which relates to his involvement in the world of health and beauty products.

When he was aged 20 he was fined by a court in Australia for attempting to make a fraudulent insurance claim when a boxing match that he was promoting fell through.

The following year he was declared bankrupt in Australia after trying to market a product aimed at people who wanted to quit smoking.

In the 1980s he reportedly made almost £20million from Bai Lin - a Chinese herbal tea that was promoted as a weight loss product in Britain, Europe and South Africa.

Despite recruiting such well-known figures as Sarah, Duchess of York, Samantha Fox and the Chelsea football squad to promote the product, Foster was fined £21,000 in 1994 for a trading standards offense relating to the weight loss claims, before being jailed a year later for breaching laws regarding his distribution of slimming granules.

Nine months later he absconded while on day release from open prison and went to Australia, though he was subsequently re-arrested and extradited back to England.

In the late 1990s, Foster launched Chow Low tea onto the U.S. market.

After publishing an advertisement claiming the tea lowered cholesterol levels in newspapers across the US - including The New York Times
 and The Washington Post - Foster was sentenced to four months in prison.

Under Californian law it is illegal to claim a food or drink can lower cholesterol levels.

Foster was jailed again in September 2000 at St Albans Crown Court, after being found guilty of using fraudulent documents to obtain credit for a company that sold thigh-reduction cream.

During sentencing the judge said: 'The sooner you go from the country the better'.

He has since found himself deported from Ireland and facing and string of arrests and fines in Australia over his involvement in various products sold as health or beauty items.

In 2007 Foster pleaded guilty to forging documents relating to $300,000 he obtained fraudulently from the National Bank of the Federated States of Micronesia and was sentenced to four and a half years in an Australian prison. He was released on parole at the start of May 2009.

Foster's current place on Interpol's 'most wanted' list relates to going on the run last October while  on trial in Brisbane for contempt of court.

In his absence he was given sentenced to at least 18 months in prison.

Foster's current whereabouts are unknown.
