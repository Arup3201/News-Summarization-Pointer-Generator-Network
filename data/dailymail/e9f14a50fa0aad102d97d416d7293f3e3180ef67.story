A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a young woman's body was discovered in a canal on Christmas Day.

Ruby Love, who was born Rubina Malik, was found in the Grand Union Canal at Bankside in Southall, west London, shortly before midday on Sunday, police said.

The 23-year-old was from Harrow in north-west London.

Officers were called to the scene by a member of the public at about 11.40am on Sunday.

A 27-year old man was arrested on Tuesday and remains in custody at a north London police station.

Miss Love was thought to have known the arrested man.

A post-mortem examination was not able to establish a formal cause of death and the results of further tests are awaited. Her family have been informed.

The isolated stretch of canal last night remained sealed off as detectives preserved the scene.

A grass verge, footpath and narrow road remained behind police tape three days after the grim discovery of Miss Love's body.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 
'Police have launched a murder investigation following the discovery of a
body in the Grand Union Canal on Christmas Day.

'Police were called by a member of the public to reports of a body found in the Grand Union Canal at Bankside, Southall.

'Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed anything suspicious on, or before Christmas Day.'

The section of canal where her body 
was spotted is part of popular walk the Hillingdon Trail and has been 
handed a 'seal of approval' by the London Walking Forum.
