Vile: A woman nightclub reveller has caused outrage by being caught on camera defecating in Swansea city centre

A woman nightclub reveller has caused outrage after being caught on camera defecating in a city centre street.

The woman, who appears to be in her early twenties, was caught in the act by a mobile phone camera and a disgusting three-minute video was later posted onto Facebook.

It shows another young woman acting as a lookout while her friend lifts up her dress, pulls down her underwear and proceeds to defecate on the pavement.

The shocking incident will raise fresh concerns about the shocking scenes caused by endemic binge drinking in the UK's city centres.

Police were yesterday examining the video and say a criminal offence may have been committed.

The young woman had been out in Swansea, South Wales, when she committed the degrading act in the city’s Princess Way.

Her face can be seen clearly at the start of the three-minute video.

She was then filmed lifting up her grey dress and pulling her knickers down to just above her knees.

As she carries out her appalling act her lookout friend squats down behind her to urinate.

Other revellers were walking past as the two women soiled the pavement.

Disgusted nightclubber Oliver Thomas, 24, said: 'It’s a shocking way to behave - what was she thinking of?

'Men get a lot of stick for peeing in the street late at night but this is something else altogether.'

He added: 'It does nothing for Swansea’s reputation - it is too disgusting for words.'

Another reveller, who didn’t want to be named, said: 'She is like an animal - I hope the police find out who she is and prosecute her.'

South Wales Police said they were aware of the incident and are appealing for information about both women in the video.
