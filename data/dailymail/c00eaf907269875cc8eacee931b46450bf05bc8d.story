Stroke, pictured, could affect patients' moral compass, altering the way they think about errors and intentions, a new study has found

Stoke could affect patients' moral compass, altering they way they think about mistakes and people's intentions, a new study has found.

Scientists in Buenos Aires found those victims who suffered a stroke affecting the frontal region of the brain were more likely to forgive, as long as no actual harm was done.

The study concluded the effect on moral judgement was similar to those patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 

It found the stroke patients placed more emphasis on the outcome of a situation, focusing less on what a person's intentions were. 

Agustin Ibanez, of the Institute of Congitive Neurology in the Argentinian capital, and his team, said: 'For both disorders, patients judged scenarios where the protagonists believed that they would cause harm but did not as being more permissible than the control group. 

Altogether, 'the performance of both groups is characterised by an over-reliance on outcome rather than by the integration of intentions and outcomes,' everydayhealth.com reported. 

Researchers compared eight patients who had suffered stroke in the frontal region of the brain, and 19 patients believed to be suffered frontotemporal dementia, and an equal number of healthy, control patients.

None of the study participants had been diagnosed with any other psychiatric disorders, neurological diseases or had suffered brain damage.

They were presented four different scenarios.

They involved no intended or actual harm, accidental harm, unsuccessfully-attempted harm, and successfully-attempted harm.

Both those patients who had suffered a stroke or had FTD rated the scenario in which harm was intended but not actually caused as more acceptable, than the control group.

The patients with FTD also deemed accidental harm as less acceptable than the control group and stroke patients.

The researchers added: 'The results of this study suggest that the moral judgement abnormalities in both groups are related to an impaired integration of intentions and outcomes.'  

Dr Ibanez, told medicalresearch.com: 'Both patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and patients with frontal strokes presented moral judgment abnormalities. 

'Their deficits were related to impairments in the integration of intentions and outcomes. 

'Specifically, both patient groups judged moral scenarios by focusing on the actions’ outcomes instead of the protagonists’ intentions.'
