'I face massive physical challenges every day which can knock your confidence very quickly,' lastminute.com co-founder said

Accident: Martha Lane Fox has described how she has struggled to cope following a car crash in Morocco in 2004

Ten years after the car crash that almost killed her, internet  entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox has told how simply going for a walk remains a struggle.

The 41-year-old, who co-founded online booking agency lastminute.com, broke more than 25 bones in the crash in Morocco in 2004.

The impact smashed her pelvis in six places, shattered her right arm and leg, and caused severe internal bleeding which led to a stroke.

‘It’s not easy being inside me any more,’ she said. ‘I have to think to move. I’m used to it, but it’s still hard. I can’t run, I can’t drive.

‘If you bash your pelvis so entirely that it’s smashed, think of all the functions in your pelvis. I can’t feel my feet or legs.

‘I face massive physical challenges every day which can knock your confidence very quickly.’

Baroness Lane Fox told The Daily Telegraph  she can’t work full-time ‘because of my weird body – that can take (your confidence) away’.

After the crash, the British entrepreneur was flown to England for treatment and spent six months in hospital, undergoing a gruelling 28 operations.

Describing her physical state, she said: ‘I don’t find walking difficult but I find it exhausting, because you have to think, “lift your foot, lift your foot”.

‘I’m actually quite physically strong, it’s just that I’m a bit dangerous because I can’t balance very well and I have to think about it all the time and that’s incredibly hard.

‘I have to think about the movement and make the movement happen in a much more conscious way.

‘It’s quite a challenge – I fall over a lot on to my knees, I walk with a stick outside.

‘I face massive physical challenges every day, something that’s a constant and ever-present factor of my life that I have to manage.’

Lady Lane Fox was injured after she stepped down as managing director of lastminute.com in 2003, and before the venture was sold for £577million to Sabre Holdings. She counts herself as ‘unbelievably lucky’ that she can afford the best medical attention.

‘We made a small amount – or large amount – of money. Without that, there’s absolutely no question in my mind that I’d be dead or in a wheelchair,’ she said.

‘I was flown to a special altitude, had fast-track care so that I could have operations that might have taken months on the NHS.’

Lady Lane Fox, whose partner is fellow internet businessman Chris Gorell Barnes, became the youngest woman in the House of Lords after being given her peerage last year.

Lady Lane Fox co-founded Lastminute.com in 1998, at the height of the internet enterprise boom, with her friend Brent Hoberman.

However, after just over five years at the helm, she stepped down as managing director of the online discount site and the venture was later sold for £577million to Sabre Holdings in 2005.

She went on to set up the karaoke club chain Lucky Voice and Go On UK - a charity which aims to teach people about using the internet.

She later became a non-executive director of Marks and Spencer and the Women's Prize for Fiction, as well as a board member of Channel 4 and mydeco.com.

The businesswoman was educated at Westminster School and Oxford University, where she was known as 'Fast Lane Foxy'.

In 2009 she was appointed the UK Government’s digital champion, and worked closely with both the Labour and coalition governments. However, after three years she stepped down from the role and, while not giving any reason for the decision, said she would continue to be a ‘critical friend’ to David Cameron.

In March last year she joined the House of Lords as a crossbencher, becoming its youngest female member, and is now officially known as the Baroness of Soho.

She was appointed as Chancellor of the Open University on March 12 this year.
