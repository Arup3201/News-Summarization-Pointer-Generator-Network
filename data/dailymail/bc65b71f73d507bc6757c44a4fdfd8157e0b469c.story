David Cameron today insisted his love for Mancunian mega band The Smiths would 'never go out' – despite the group 'banning' him from listening to their music.

The Prime Minister was given a limited edition T-shirt with a photo of the indie band during a trip to Manchester today.

Frontman Morrissey has attacked Mr Cameron for declaring his love for the group – while bandmate Johnny Marr even expressed his disgust that the Tory leader 'liked' his songs.

The Prime Minister was presented with a limited-edition T-shirt featuring his favourite band after he had a tour of local newspaper offices in Manchester

After being handed the T-shirt today, the PM appeared to take a swipe at the two music stars, quipping: 'You have made my day. Thank you very much.' He then quoted a famous Smiths lyric: 'There is a light that never goes out.'

Mr Cameron is lucky to have got his hands on the T-shirt, with Smiths fans from around the world clamouring to get hold of the Salford Lads Club shirts, which have gone on sale to support local young people.

The shirt features a famous photo of The Smiths outside the club in Ordsall, similar to the one pictured on the band's 1986 album 'The Queen is Dead'.

Photographer Stephen Wright has licensed the picture for the club's T-shirts until November 2015.

The Salford Lads Club, based on the corner of Coronation Street and Ignatius Way in Salford, is a top destination for Smiths fans.

In 2010 Morrissey called on the prime minister to stop proclaiming his admiration for the Smiths

It even has its own Smiths room, which was visited by Mr Cameron in 2008.

He paid homage to the band by visiting the Lads Club in 2008 and in 2010 he chose 'This Charming Man' as one of his Desert Island Discs.

It prompted Johnny Marr to 'ban' him from listening to The Smiths and Morrissey voiced his disapproval too.

Mr Marr said: 'I think he likes the song. That's probably sadder than if he didn't know it, really. He's entitled to like whatever he likes, as long as he doesn't say it. It's a good song.'

Former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr told David Cameron to 'stop saying' he is a fan of the band

He added: 'I do forbid him to like it. He shouldn't like us because we're not his kind of people. '

Morrissey has also called on the prime minister to stop proclaiming his admiration, saying in 2010: 'David Cameron hunts and shoots and kills stags - apparently for pleasure. It was not for such people that either Meat Is Murder or The Queen Is Dead were recorded; in fact, they were made as a reaction against such violence.'

But in 2013 Mr Cameron joked about not being allowed to listen to the Smiths.

He said: 'I'm a huge music fan, but obviously it's been something of a music crisis year for me because Morrissey and Johnny Marr have said I'm not allowed to listen to The Smiths any more, so I've had to find some other stuff I am allowed to listen to.'

The Manchester band, whose other hits include Bigmouth Strikes Again and Panic, split in the 1980s.

The Smiths are not the only musicians to voice their opposition to Mr Cameron.

Nick Mulvey, a folk singer who was recently named as Mr Cameron's favourite new musician, last week said he felt a 'bit sick' at finding out the Prime Minister is a fan.

The 32-year-old songwriter, who is British but moved to Cuba at the age of 19 to study music, was clearly not impressed after Mr Cameron told an interviewer he enjoyed cooking while listening to his album Cururucu.

Asked via Twitter how he felt about the honour of being listened to by the Prime Minister, Mulvey replied: 'A bit sick.'

Mr Cameron has a musical ear and, along with wife, Samantha, likes to keep up with current music trends.

Other favourites include First Aid Kit, a Swedish folk duo who he saw in person after sneaking into a gig at the Shepherd's Bush Empire.

He has named Pink Floyd as his favourite band of all time.

Last year, the prime minister gave a 'mixtape' of British music to fellow world leaders attending a G8 summit in Northern Ireland.
