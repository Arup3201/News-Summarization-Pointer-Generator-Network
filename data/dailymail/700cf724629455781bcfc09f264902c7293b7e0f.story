As you toil away at the washing, ironing and school run, it can be easy to feel undervalued.

So it may come as some solace to know the value of such household work is soon to be given its full recognition by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Their experts have been busy calculating how much various tasks would cost if you had to pay someone else to do them as they prepare to issue a figure for Britain’s ‘unpaid gross domestic product’ next year.

Experts from the Office for National Statistics have been busy calculating how much various tasks would cost if you had to pay someone else to do them - washing and drying accounted for £86.3 billion

So far, for example, they have calculated that laundry services, including producing, repairing, washing, drying and pressing clothes, were worth £97.2 billion in the whole of the UK in 2012.

Of that, washing and drying accounted for £86.3 billion, with ironing contributing considerably less – as the study found that despite the average household doing 260 laundry loads per year, Britons only iron 10 per cent of all clothing.

Informal childcare, meaning all care by parents and other relatives which does not involve a monetary transaction and including time when an adult may not be directly interacting with the child but is still responsible for them, was said to be worth £343 billion in 2010 - about three times the contribution of the financial services industry.

The figures found household transport, including the school run, was worth £269 billion in 2010

Household transport, including the school run, was worth £269 billion in 2010. 

The calculations were based on various rates per mile, for instance trips in London of two miles or less were worked out using minicab rates of £5.29 a mile while the price for a similar journey in the rest of Britain was £3.44 dropping to £1.44 a mile after more than two miles.

Informal adult care, ranging from giving specialised care to an elderly relative such as changing dressings on a wound to ‘keeping an eye’ on someone or doing their shopping, was worth £61.7 billion in 2010.

The more than 2 billion hours of voluntary work put in by selfless individuals in 2012 raising money, leading groups, campaigning, or befriending and mentoring people, was valued at £23.9 billion.

Valerie Fender, head of economic well-being at the ONS believes the unpaid economy is worth about the same as the GDP, which is the principal means of determining the health of the UK economy.

The figures so far were released in a series of ONS reports called the nation’s ‘Household Satellite Accounts’ (HHSA) over recent months.

The HHSA measures and values all the unpaid production of goods and services such as cooking, cleaning and provision of childcare by households in the UK.

The reports state: ‘The HHSA extends the National Accounts boundary to include all activity produced by households that could be delegated to another person. 

‘The HHSA provides a means by which the influence of changing patterns of unpaid work on the economy can be measured. 

'The information may also be of use to policy makers who may need to take significant amounts of unpaid work into account when making policy decisions.’

Today an ONS spokesman said: ‘Over the last few months we’ve been releasing different reports looking at various different parts of household production, or things you have to do for everyday life, and if you were to pay for them what the contribution to GDP would be. 

'A report bringing them all together will be put out in the coming weeks.’
