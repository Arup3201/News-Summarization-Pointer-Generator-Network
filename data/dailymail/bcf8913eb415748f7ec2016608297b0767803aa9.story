Striking teachers and union protesters who forced thousands of lessons to be cancelled spent this afternoon drinking in Westminster.

After marching past Parliament in protest at pay reforms, dozens of people carrying union flags and wearing badges in support of the industrial action were seen drinking wine and beer in nearby pubs and restaurants.

One in four schools was closed and many others were forced to introduce emergency timetables after the NASUW and the National Union of Teachers (NUT) staged walkouts in the North East and Cumbria, the South West, South East and London.

NASUWT chief Chris Keates declared today: ‘No teacher comes out with a spring in their step taking strike action.’

But
 supporters of those same striking teachers seemed to be quite happy as 
they spilled into the streets of Westminster clutching bottles of wine 
and pints of lager.

Groups 
which almost certainly included teachers and union members were seen 
clutching flags and wearing badges declaring: 'Protecting teachers, 
defending education' as they enjoyed a drink in the sun.

One
 of the flags was seen planted in an empty bottle of wine outside Pizza 
Express in Millbank, while round the corner groups of protesters downed 
drinks outside the Marquis of Granby pub.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the education select committee, said: ‘They claim they’re standing up for education, but it looks like they’ve been sitting down for a boozy lunch.

‘Today’s jolly won’t do anything to convince parents that these unions really care about educating children.

‘All these strikes will do is disrupt parents’ lives, hold back children’s education and damage the reputation of the profession.’

It is the latest industrial action in a
 long-running dispute over plans for performance-related pay for the 
best teachers and changes to pensions and conditions.

Speaking
 at a rally in Durham, Miss Keates said: ‘What we are seeing is a real 
air of determination to demonstrate that they are sick and tired of 
Education Secretary Michael Gove's denigration of the profession and the
 relentless attacks he has made on them, which they believe are attacks 
on children and young people.'

Ms
 Keates estimated that around 2,000 people had taken part in the Durham 
rally alone, and said the strikes had ‘served their purpose’.

NUT general secretary Christine 
Blower said: "Today's strike action has been a great success and is an 
indication of the anger and concern that teachers share about the 
changes this Government is making to the profession.

'Strike action does of course always 
come at a price and we are very well aware of the disruption this causes
 to parents' working lives as well as their children's education.

'Unfortunately, with a Government 
that will not negotiate on the issues of our dispute over pay, pensions 
and workload, we have been left with little choice.'

She added: 'We do not want to be on 
strike but if we do not make teaching attractive there will be huge 
problems for recruiting and retaining good teachers.

'Michael Gove has demoralised an 
entire profession and today's action is a direct result of his and the 
Government's steadfast refusal to accept there are problems that need to
 be resolved.

'We urge the Government to set aside their prejudices and talk to the profession for the sake of everyone.'

But Prime Minister David Cameron said responsibility for the walkouts lay with the unions and that he was ‘disappointed’ they had decided to strike.

‘It is very inconvenient for parents, it is not good for pupils' education,’ he told BBC Sussex radio.

‘And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews.’

Childcare search website 
findababysitter.com said it had seen a 77 per cent rise in emergency 
childcare adverts being posted since Monday afternoon, compared to the 
same period last week.

Parents are paying out up to £100 for emergency care, the site said, amounting to £1.2 billion in total.

Placards: Members of the National Union of Teachers also took part in a rally in Hoglands Park, Southampton.

Target: Education Secretary Michael Gove featured on many of the placards in the protests

The unions have said that the dispute focuses on three key issues - pay, pensions and conditions.

They
 are opposed to Government plans to allow schools to set teachers' 
salaries, linked to performance in the classroom, and argue that 
pensions changes will leave their members working longer, paying in more
 and receiving less when they retire.

They also accuse the Government of attacking their working conditions, including introducing reforms that will allow schools to have longer school days and longer terms.

A Department for Education spokeswoman
 said: ‘The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for 
pupils and parents today as possible.

‘In
 spite of this, thanks to many hard-working teachers and heads, only 
around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today.

‘It
 is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are striking over the 
Government's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more.

‘In
 a recent poll, 61 per of respondents supported linking teachers' pay to
 performance and 70 per cent either opposed the strikes or believed that
 teachers should not be allowed to strike at all.

‘All strikes do is disrupt parents' lives, hold back children's education and damage the reputation of the profession.’

She insisted the government had met with the unions "frequently" to discuss their concerns, and that they would continue to do so.

The first regional walkout took place in the North West on June 27, and further strikes took place in the East of England, the East Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside on October 1.

Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.
