Manchester United keeper David de Gea has revealed it is unthinkable for the club to finish outside of the Champions League places for two seasons in a row.

United return to domestic action at home to Aston Villa on Saturday with two wins against top four rivals Tottenham and Liverpool having given Louis van Gaal's side some breathing space behind Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal.

Now De Gea has underlined just how important it is for United to get back in to European football's blue riband competition after spending this season in the wildnerness.

De Gea has played an instrumental role in United's rise to the top four of the Premier League so far 

'We have to qualify for the Champions League, no matter what,' said De Gea.

'We already missed out last season, and a team like Manchester United cannot do that two years in a row.'

While Van Gaal's team have struggled for consistency this season, De Gea has been outstanding yet again in goal. The Spanish international's own future remains in doubt as he only has one year left on his contract at the end of this season.

However, De Gea recognises how much he owes the English game for the manner in which it has enabled to improve his game in recent seasons.

'I'm a composed, calm type, which helps me in my profession,' he revealed.

'As a keeper, you need to convey a sense of calm to the rest of the team.

'But, truth be told, English football has changed me a great deal.

'I've developed a lot physically, I have greatly improved my concentration and have generally improved all aspects of my game.

'I was very young when I came here but, four years on, things are very good overall. This league really suits me, as you learn a lot here.'

Since January, De Gea has been working at Old Trafford with former Spanish international Victor Valdes as his understudy.

'Victor Valdes and I work very well together – I'm very happy to be with him,' added De Gea.

'I'm learning so much from him, not just in goalkeeping terms given his immense experience, but also as a person.

'He's a very straightforward guy with a lot of character. Moreover, he's always ready to lend a hand, trying to help out with his advice, especially during games.'

He arrived at Barcelona in 1995, and left in January after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury
