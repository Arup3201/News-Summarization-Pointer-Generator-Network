The beauty of the Great Barrier Reef could soon be smothered in sediment after Australian authorities approved plans to dredge the site.

A number of local firms from Queensland and surrounding areas want to use the nearby Abbot Point port to export coal, and the dredging is necessary to allow ships to enter the port.

The plans have been approved by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), yet scientists are urging the authorities not to go through with them because the sediment could end up poisoning the fragile coral.

The Great Barrier Reef covers 1,429 miles and is so large it can be seen from outer space. 

Marine
 creatures include 600 types of soft and hard corals, more than 100 
species of jellyfish, 3000 varieties of molluscs, 500 species of worms, 
1625 types of fish, 133 varieties of sharks and rays, and more than 30 
species of whales and dolphins.

It extends south from the northern tip of Queensland in north-eastern Australia to just north of Bundaberg.

The reef is an at risk World Heritage listed site that UNESCO believes could become an 'in danger' later this year.

In a statement, the GBRMPA said: 'After rigorous assessment, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has approved an application by North Queensland Bulk Ports Corporation to dispose of dredge spoil at a deepwater location offshore of Abbot Point, subject to strict environmental conditions.

'It’s important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand, silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds.'

Yet it added it would consider an alternative location if one was found 'to be equal to or better in terms of environmental or heritage outcomes.'

As a result, the authorities and 
scientists are investigating an area north of the port where the 
sediment could be dumped instead.

The approved disposal site is located approximately 15 miles east-north-east of the port, while the investigation zone is located 12 to 18 miles from the area being dredged.

At the start of January, 233 scientists signed a petition urging GBRMPA to reject the proposals.

Greenpeach Reef campaigner Louise Matthiesson slammed the decision as a 'disgrace'.

'The government’s priority should be to protect a reef which took millions of years to form, not take active steps to damage it,' said Matthiesson.

'Marine scientists have rung warning bells of the consequences of dredging and dumping on the reef.

'This makes today’s development an international embarrassment for the Queensland and federal governments.'

She warned the dumping is 'one more body blow for the reef' and claimed the plans threaten marine life, its World Heritage status and ultimately Australia's tourism and fishing industries.

The dredging is due to take place in 2015 between March and June.
