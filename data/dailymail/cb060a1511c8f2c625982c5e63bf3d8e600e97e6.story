When Michael Rock planted 11 fruit trees on his allotment, he hoped to make enough jam to give to his pensioner neighbours.

But it turned out he was sowing the seeds of his own eviction.

Mr Rock’s pear, plum, apple, cherry and apricot trees did not impress many of his 600 fellow tenants more used to growing potatoes, marrows and leeks on their prized plots.

They complained to the council, leading to a new set of rules requiring that three quarters of any allotment should be used for ‘productive crops’ such as vegetables.

Allotment owner Michael Rock stands on his plot of land in protest. He doesn't want to be evicted from the land he grows his 11 fruit trees

He won't budge on the allotment: Mr Rock says he will appeal the case where a judge ruled against his wishes

Mr Rock, 60, a Canadian-born author 
who lives in a tower block in Hastings, refused to agree to the new 
rules that would force him to plant vegetables under his trees.

He said he had grown potatoes, leeks and onions in the past but had produced so many that they had gone to waste.

As a result, Hastings Borough Council 
attempted to evict Mr Rock from his 250-square-metre plot and he decided
to challenge the decision in court.

He said: ‘The council are not playing by the rules and should be ashamed of themselves. They are acting like bullies.

‘I have invested a lot of time and money in my plot and I am not prepared to see that undone.’

At Hastings County Court, the 
barrister for the council, Jack Anderson, said: ‘I suggest there is 
ample space at that plot for the cultivation of flowers and vegetables.’

Mr Rock replied: ‘No. I can’t plant 
things where the trees are supposed to grow. I have not breached the 
contract. This council ruling is to remove people who abandon their 
plots. I love the trees and I feel I am being penalised.

‘I was never given any leaflets detailing what I could grow. I was given permission to grow fruit trees as dwarf stock.’

After a four-hour hearing, District Judge Geoffrey Smith ruled he could not grant an injunction against the eviction.

But he appealed for common sense to 
prevail, saying: ‘It is sad this case has come to court. I would 
encourage both parties to find some middle ground.’

An unrepentant Mr Rock – who was 
forced to pay court costs of £650 – insisted: ‘They will have to evict 
me if they want me out. I will fight all the way to the European Court 
of Human Rights if I have to.’

The 90,000 who'd like his plot

The council is now considering its 
next move. A spokesman said: ‘We have been encouraging Mr Rock since 
2008 to bring the level of cultivation of his plot up to an agreed and 
acceptable standard.

‘In February 2011 we were left with no
option but to serve notice requiring him to improve the levels of 
cultivation as he was in breach of his tenancy agreement.

‘Rather than cultivate his allotment, 
Mr Rock sought an injunction and a declaration from the court to 
preserve his rights as an allotment holder. We contested that Mr Rock 
was not entitled to the relief requested; the judge dismissed Mr Rock’s 
claim and awarded costs to the council.’

A spokesman for the National Allotment
Society said: ‘We understand the reasons for tenancy agreements, but 
would always advise councils not to impose them retrospectively.’
