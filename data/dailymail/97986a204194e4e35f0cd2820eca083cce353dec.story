Commerce City police quickly responded to the home Saturday, after neighbors and guests had called 911. 

On Monday, the department said it is investigating the incident, adding that the shooter is being cooperative.

Police said the owner of the border collie told them he shot Clifford after he was unable to separate the dogs.

Afterward, neighbors and party guests told the Martinez family the shooter was calling out: 'I have a concealed weapon license,' as he walked away.

The Martinez family told the paper that the man had been walking past their house for two months, and had stopped to complain about Clifford's barking. 

Raymond Martinez, Emily's husband, said there had been no big arguments, insisting that Clifford was not aggressive, and felt the deadly encounter could have been avoided if he had simply walked somewhere else.
