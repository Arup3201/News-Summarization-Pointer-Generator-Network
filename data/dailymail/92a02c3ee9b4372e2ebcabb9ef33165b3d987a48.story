A pirate play area had to be closed during half-term after parents found their children trying to pick up used needles and syringes in the sandpit.

Parents slammed drug users for leaving sharp objects in an area where children could easily hurt themselves and become infected.

Police were called to the play park in Carrington, Nottingham, and the council closed the area while it was 'thoroughly cleansed'.

A pirate play area in Carrington, Nottingham had to be closed  after parents found their children trying to pick up used needles and syringes in the sandpit

Yvonne Mutton, who took her four-year-old twin grandchildren to the play area, said: 'It's atrocious. What else can I say. It's disgusting that someone would leave that stuff in a park used by children.

'I usually think this is a nice play area but it's very worrying that it is being used for that sort of drug behaviour.'

Other drug paraphernalia was also discovered, including an opened wrapper for a sterile spoon and an unopened syringe.

Doctor David Hewson, 32, who has just moved to the area with his two-year-old son William and six-month-old baby, said: 'We picked Mapperley Park as an area to live because we had heard good things but this is so disappointing to hear.

'I've cycled past here a few times at around 6am in the morning and seen some suspicious people who looked like they were up to no good.'

His wife Anna, 36, added: 'It makes me more conscious of coming back here and I will take more care to look out for these things.

'Children are inquisitive and will pick anything up, so it could be very dangerous.'

Dave Halstead, head of neighbourhood operations for the authority, added: 'This is a park which is used and loved by many local families.

'Our staff service the park and this is the first time they have found evidence of any drug related activity.

'It is disappointing that someone has chosen to dispose of drugs equipment at a children's playground.

'A team was sent out as soon as we were notified and closed a section of the park before retrieving various items of drug paraphernalia and thoroughly cleaning the area.'
