A mother who witnessed a paediatrician hog-tying her seven-year-old son during a consultation has called for the doctor to be deregistered.

One of Australia's leading experts in child behaviour, Dr Neville Goodwin Davis, pleaded guilty to assault after allegedly sitting on the young boy's back at a Gold Coast clinic in October 2012.

The  mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, took photos of the incident on her camera phone which show Mr Davis tying her son's hands behind his back and ankles together.

A mother wants to sue Dr Neville Goodwin Davis for compensation after he allegedly hog-tied her son

The unnamed mother claimed she screamed and broke down as she told Dr Davis to get off her son

Speaking to A Current Affair, the outraged mother claimed she screamed and broke down as she told Dr Davis to get off her son, who was being treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Fearing her son may have had Aspergers Syndrome, the mother raised concerns with Mr Davis but she never expected he would use a rope as a technique to control her son's behaviour.

'He just told me that he was going to prove to me that he didn't have Aspergers and that's when he [son] was tied up,' the distraught mother said.

'He told me an Aspergers child would be screaming their lungs out by now. That was his way of telling me he doesn't have Aspergers.'

Aspergers syndrome is a condition that falls within the autism spectrum. People with the condition often have difficulty forming friendships and communicating with others, as well as having difficulty understanding social rules and interpreting the body language of others, according to the Victorian state health department.

Despite her photo evidence, Dr Davis was hit with just a 12-month, $1000 good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded for the alleged assault.

'I am absolutely furious. I'll never have that closure that I needed to see him standing there getting the guilty verdict I knew he'd deserved,' the mother said.

The mother claims her son was seizure-free but after the consultation, he suffered a major seizure that night

The mother claimed that Dr Davis also threatened to flush her son's head down the toilet but he later denied the allegations in court. 

She claimed her son was seizure-free for two and a half years but following the consultation, the seven-year-old suffered a major seizure that night.

'He now has got severe anxiety. Everything is bitten, he bites holes in his shirt, he bites Wii controls, he bites them right through to the metal,' his mother said.

She added that her son has been suffering high anxiety, triggering seizures causing calcium deposits on his brain with doctors fearing he may not survive for another five years.

Michelle Ridgen (pictured) also claims Dr Davis allegedly assaulted her five-year-old son 10 years ago

Another mother, Michelle Ridgen also claims Dr Davis carried out 'barbaric' acts when he treated her five-year-old son 10 years ago for behavioural problems.

'It's just unspeakable - it makes you feel sick in the stomach,' Ms Ridgen told A Current Affair.

'He told us this is the way to discipline your child - you just grab him by the hair, pull him to his feet,' she said.

The Australian Medical Board has ruled Dr Davis 'must not treat, consult or assess a patient under the age of 18 years without the presence of a Committee approved chaperone'.

He will face the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal on March 27 to determine whether he will result in a suspension or deregistration.
