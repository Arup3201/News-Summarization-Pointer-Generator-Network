Gary Lineker has blasted 'silly' international games of Twitter in the wake of comfortable wins for both England and Republic of Ireland this week.

The Three Lions put five past San Marino in an ambient stroll at Wembley on Thursday, while a Robbie Keane hat-trick paved the way for the Irish to thrash Gibraltar 7-0 on Saturday.

And regular tweeter Lineker has had his say on matters, stating after Ireland's win that: 'Some of these international games are just silly nowadays. Not much more than pub teams.'

Lineker also posted a series of tweets during England's easy win over San Marino, suggesting that the man who netted 48 goals for the Three Lions was not taking their opponents entirely seriously.

He began with 'There are no easy games in international football anymore... codswallop of a footballing cliche! #SanMarino', before encouraging Rooney and Danny Welbeck before kick-off to 'fill your boots!'.

It should, however, get a little more difficult for the two sides. Up next for England is a trip to Talinn to face Estonia on Sunday evening. While Martin O'Neill takes his Ireland side to face Germany on Tuesday.
