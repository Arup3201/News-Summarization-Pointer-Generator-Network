His first 'instructional video' taught teenagers how to change an empty toilet roll in the bathroom - and went on to attract more than four million views.

Now 'distressed dad' Will Reid has moved onto his next bone of contention: the dishwasher.

And he's fed up with something that most of us are guilty of, when we've finished our dinner and eating the food seems to have taken that last bit of energy out of us.

The offending items that Mr Reid is going to show how can be dealt with

It's all tongue-in-cheek as Reid demonstrates how to put a plate into the dishwasher

So much so, that the used cutlery and crockery is simply placed 'in the vicinity' of the dishwasher instead of in it.

In his latest tongue-in-cheek offering, Mr Reid, from Southampton, has some advice for his teenage children, James and Beth, on how to load the dishwasher.

Writing on his YouTube page, he says: 'I honestly didn't think there would be another one as the first one was spontaneous and meant as a joke. A joke that seems to have struck a chord with quite a few people!!

'I have really enjoyed reading all your comments and suggestions and because of that, I decided to give it a go and see what you all think. 

'All I ask is please don't take any of this too seriously. It is all just a bit of fun and who knows, maybe James and Beth may one day actually load the dishwasher or change the toilet roll?!! Sandra and I certainly hope so!!'

Managing to keep a straight face as he explains his aims of the short film, Mr Reid pans to some crockery and rubbish on the worktop, helpfully telling us that 'not all of this goes into the dishwasher.'

Reid is hoping his video will strike a nerve with other parents who struggle to get their teenagers to tidy up

The distressed dad shows the 'advanced level', which involves switching the dishwasher on

Take note, James and Beth.

'It's really just the plates, and the knives and forks and spoons. There's a few dirty things already in here already,' he says as he opens the dishwasher door.

'But that goes in there like that, you can put a plate in there like that.'

The exasperated father then points to a bowl that 'needs to be rinsed out a bit' as it has 'congealed' after being left in one of his children's bedrooms.

'Really that's about all there is to it,' adds Mr Reid, before educating teens on the 'advanced level'.

'Put a dishwasher tab in here, and these buttons on top are like the buttons on your Xbox or PlayStation that make it work, or effectively boot it up. Give that a try and let me know how you get on, and thanks for watching.'

Helpfully, Mr Reid points to where the 'tab' goes so his children have no excuse

In a message on his YouTube page, Mr Reid writes: 'I hope this raises a smile and maybe some knowing nods'

'If it does, please share and let's see what happens.

'Despite my kids saying that I'm not funny and no one would be interested, I guess I have shown them that maybe Dads do know a thing or two about the internet! Who would have thought?!!!'
