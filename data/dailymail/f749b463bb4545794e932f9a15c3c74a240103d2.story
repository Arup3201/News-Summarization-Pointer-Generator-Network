It's the most wonderful time of the year...and the Christmas festivities are kicking off in London's Covent Garden.

But one reindeer seems to have forgotten its festive spirit, arriving in the city by truck, instead of sleigh, and promptly urinating on the pavement. 

Ahead of the big Christmas lights switch on, the famous cobblestone-laden district received a visit from the four-legged visitor, with some Christmas helpers in tow.

Tonight at 6pm, the annual Christmas light lightning will take place - complete with some special visitors 

Also being unveiled tonight is a 22-feet tall silver reindeer replica to be placed in the middle of the square

Each Saturday afternoon, beginning on November 8, visitors will also be able to stop by and pet the reindeer

The reindeer arrived in Covent Garden this morning, where they were ushered inside by festive 'elves'

The reindeer was led into the iconic square ahead of a celebratory night in which a giant festive replica in silver will be unveiled.

A video has emerged showing the adorable animal arriving in Covent Garden, where it was unceremoniously led out of a truck, greeted by festive helpers, and promptly decided to treat the square as its bathroom.

And the real-life reindeer will be in good company with the square's new decoration for 2014, with a giant 22-feet tall silver replica being unveiled this evening.

Decorations also include the signature 15,000 sparkling pea-lights.

The London Youth Choir will also perform tonight to celebrate the arrival of Christmas and these furry friends

The London Youth Choir will mark the evening's switch-on moment with a free, open-air performance.

Crosstown Doughnuts will also be on hand giving away personalised Covent Garden-themed red and white treats.

Every Saturday afternoon, beginning November 8, until Saturday, December 20, visitors can stop by to pet the reindeer between 12-4pm.
