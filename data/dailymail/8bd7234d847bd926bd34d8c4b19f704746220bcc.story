Everton striker Romelu Lukaku wants to be the best player in the world claims team mate Tim Howard.

Much is expected of the Belgian international having sealed his permanent move to Goodison Park this summer, having impressed last season on loan from Chelsea.

The club record £28million signing scored his first goal of the campaign during the 2-0 win against former club West Brom on Saturday as he looks to beat his tally of 16 for the toffees last season.

'He's electric, he's alive, he celebrates goals in training, everything counts to him. Everything matters.

'That's what you want to see. There are too many young kids that take it for granted. Romelu doesn't. He cost a lot of money but he is not arrogant, he is hungry.'

Lukaku will look to fire Everton to wins over Wolfsburg in the Europa League on Thursday before hosting Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday.
