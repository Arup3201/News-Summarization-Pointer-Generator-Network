A marine who lost both legs and an arm in Afghanistan says he will have to re-mortgage his house to pay for a new set of limbs - despite a Government promise to pay for them.

Lance Corporal Mark Ormrod needs £115,000 to buy the top-of-the-range prosthetics which are not available on the NHS.

The Government has announced a new £6.5million scheme to buy state-of-the-art 'bionic' legs for soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan - but Cpl Ormrod has dismissed this as a 'publicity stunt'.

Former Royal Marine Mark Ormrod, pictured left serving in Afghanistan where he lost both legs and his right arm above the elbow, says a Government scheme to provide 'state-of-the-art' prosthetics to soldiers wounded in action could flop if medical staff don't received better training on how to fit them

Cpl Ormrod the UK's 
first triple amputee, warned that the programme could flop unless better
training to fit the limbs was provided for medical staff and NHS 
prosthetists.

He said: ‘I think I was a little bit 
more let down than angry. I really thought this may have been the 
turning point. I feel deflated.

'It's going to cost me £115,000. I will have to re-mortgage my house, or start a fundraising campaign.

'I rely on my limbs every day of my 
life. As an individual my circumstances need me to have a better level 
of care. There's just no funding for it.'

The 
former Royal Marine was blown up by an improvised explosive device (IED)
in Helmand on Christmas Eve 2007. He lost both legs above the knee and 
his right arm above the elbow.

The 29-year-old father-of-two said: 'The legs they want to provide are state of the art, no argument.

'But the truth is medical staff in the UK don't know how to use them or set them up properly.

'These
are incredibly complicated bits of kit and it takes years of experience
and the latest software to get the very best out of them.

'It
is not the fault of the NHS. They just have not got the experience of 
working with bilateral amputees in such large numbers and acting on 
their feedback.

'The 
Government has said it will not use this money to send its amputees to 
see the people in the America who have the skills to transform our lives
and our mobility.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said troops who have had their legs blown off by roadside bombs will receive the most technologically-advanced prosthetic limbs

'Instead, you'll have the new legs, which are brilliant, fitted in the UK on the NHS. Fair enough you might say.

'But
what is the point of having the most brilliant prosthetic leg in the 
world, if it keeps falling off because of a bad socket fit?'

But Paralympic rower Captain Nick Beighton, who competed at the London Olympics after losing both his legs in a blast while on a foot patrol in Afghanistan in 2009, praised the programme.

The 31-year-old Royal Engineer, now with the Royal School of Military Engineering, said: 'To have the opportunity to try it and to use it and get the latest technology is fabulous for us because it just gives us that freedom to get out and do more things and have greater functionality and more independence, essentially.'

Speaking at the military rehabilitation centre at Headley Court in Surrey, the officer who had his right leg blown off through the knee and his left leg above the knee, said: 'As you build your strength up and build you independence up, you obviously want to functionally be at a higher level, and that's what this leg offers.'

The 'bionic' leg - made famous by the British Paralympic discus thrower Derek Derenalagi last summer - will be fitted to servicemen and women where clinical conditions indicate is appropriate.

Surgeon General Air Marshal Paul Evans said: 'This is a fantastic prosthetic development and has been seen to have proven benefits for certain amputees. It will improve the quality of life and rehabilitation for our patients.'
