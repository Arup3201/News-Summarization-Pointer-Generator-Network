Italian footballer and father-of-three Antonio Floro Flores has pledged to adopt a three-day-old baby who was found abandoned on a train.

Flores decided to adopt the child after hearing how the baby boy had been left in a railway car, and contacted authorities to see if he could provide the child a home.

The baby boy, aged between around three or four days old, was found with its umbilical 
cord still attached, under the seat of a train in southern 
Italy last week.

Antonio Floro Flores has declared that he will adopt the child, having been touched by his tragic story of abandonment in the news

The child was found wrapped in a shawl and a pajama top, and placed inside a shopping bag, in the last carriage of a train which was headed towards Baiano from Naples.

When the conductor of the train found him, he was taken to Moscati hospital in Avellino, where the staff of the hospital named him Francesco.

Despite the circumstances of his abandonment, doctors have said the child is healthy, weighing 2.5 kilos, and tests show he was breast-fed shortly before being abandoned.

Since he was abandoned, footballer Floro Flores was struck by the story, and decided to take the child under his wing, announcing his and his wife's intention on Twitter.

He said: 'After seeing little Francesco, we followed what our heart dictated.

'I am
 a father before being a soccer player, but certainly not a hero!'

Floro Flores and his wife are making sure the child is being adopted through the proper procedures, and is working with authorities to do so.

Before he began the adoption process, the authorities had tried to contact the parents of the child.

They also attempted to search CCTV on the Metrostat Circumvesuviana train to see if they could identify the parents, but have so far been unsuccessful.

The conductor of the train, Antonio, said: 'Over
 the course of my career on the trains Iâ€™ve found everything, from 
mobile phones to fish in shopping bags.

'Who would have thought that one day I would find a baby.'
