A police force has made more than 50 cardboard cut-outs of the same police officer in an effort to deter crime.

Gwent Police had the 7ft larger-than-life models of Newport-based PC Rhydian Jones made to put up as a warning in shoplifting hotspots.

The images of the officer started appearing in November 2011 before the scheme was later extended. In total, 52 of the cut-outs have been made at a cost of more than £13,000.

A Gwent Police spokesman said: 'They have been distributed throughout our force area and teams use them tactically to deter shoplifting.

'We are not prepared to say where they are at this moment as they are often moved about to tackle a particular problem.'

The cut-outs have cost £255 each. One store manager, Lee Hillier, who has one of the cardboard cut-outs in his store for the past three months, said he felt it had reduced crime.

He said: 'It’s right by the front of the door and people look up at it as they walk into the store.'

Hannah Shingler, a sales assistant at a Co-Operative store where there is another cut-out, added: 'I think it’s reduced crime a little bit. I think there would be more if it wasn’t there.'

The cut-outs, placed next to doors of shops where shoplifting is a common problem, are all of PC Rhydian Jones holding a sign aimed to deter thieves.

The sign reads: 'Gwent Police and this store are working together to stop shoplifting. Please be aware there are police operations in this area.'

The initiative were first introduced when Gwent Police discovered shoplifting was increasing, despite other crimes falling.

Other police forces across the UK have now started to adopt the scheme, including Thames Valley Police in Berkshire.
