The first woman bishop in the UK and Ireland has been installed by the Anglican Church.

The Rev Pat Storey, 53, former rector of St Augustine's in Derry, made history when she was chosen by the Church of Ireland as the new Bishop of Meath and Kildare.

The married mother of two was ordained at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin during a service led by the Archbishop of Dublin, The Most Rev Dr Michael Jackson.

The Rev Nigel Parker, guest preacher, paid tribute to her.

'Pat, it has been our privilege over the years to see you respond to our Father's love with love, trust and obedience,' he said to Bishop Storey during the service.

'You have given yourself whole-heartedly to Him and His Church, serving His people as a deacon and priest - teaching the Scriptures and pastoring with that disarming directness, which is your hallmark - a directness, which speaks the truth in love, with a ready laugh and delightful sense of humour.

'You have demonstrated your love for the Father in your hard work, impeccable organisation and evangelistic heart, which longs to see people come into the family of God, through the completed work of Jesus Christ.

'You have shown your care and thoughtfulness to many, not least your family, Earl, Carolyn and Luke, and to us, your friends.

'So today, it is our privilege to pray for you, as the Lord Jesus calls you to a deeper life of sacrificial service, calls you to consecrate yourself to Him, His Church and His cause.'

Bishop Storey is married to the Rev Earl Storey - who gave a reading during the service - and they have two adult children Luke, 22, and Carolyn, 25, and son-in-law Peter.

She grew up in Belfast and studied French and English at Trinity College, Dublin, before training at the Church of Ireland Theological College.

She was ordained a deacon in 1997 and a priest the following year, serving a curacy in Ballymena, a team vicar in Glenavy, and as a part-time youth worker co-ordinator.

Bishop Storey was rector of St Augustine's in Derry since 2004 until her appointment was passed by the House of Bishops in September, four months after the Episcopal Electoral College had failed to elect a successor.

At the time she said she was 'excited and daunted' by the historic appointment.

She has taken over from Dr Richard Clarke, who was appointed Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland last December.

After the service Bishop Storey said she was still getting her head around making history.

'It's great to be the first woman and it's great to be a bishop, I hadn't expected it at all,' she told RTE.

'I'm sort of getting my head around the fact that it's a history-making thing.

'But I'm very happy to be here. It was a lovely service.'

Her husband added that he was incredibly proud and thrilled for his wife and for the future.
