An animal-mad bride walked down the aisle with her pet donkey and bulldog after convincing her local reverend they needed to be part of the service.

Charlotte Sullivan, 40, from Herefordshire surprised her friends and family when she tied the knot with Matthew, 51, accompanied by their 12-year-old mule Moses. 

Her pet bulldog Bessie, four, was also an honorary bridesmaid for the service in Weston-under-Penyard on August 9.

Charlotte Sullivan's wedding to partner Matthew included her donkey, Moses, walking up the aisle

Reverend Neil Patterson conducted the hour-long ceremony at St Lawrence Church.

After her nuptials, foster carer and mother-of-five Charlotte said: 'Everyone who knows me knows that I am animal mad.

'Because my children have been brought up with animals I thought it would be a great thing to do. We’ve had Moses for years - I bought him when he was just nine months old and he’s been with us ever since.

'It wouldn’t have been right without him there, weddings are a family occasion and Moses is part of the family.

'Animals are such a huge part of my life - I have six dogs and a horse as well as Moses - it just made sense for him to be there.

'When I spoke to Reverend Neil he had anticipated me asking to bring one of the dogs to the church but perhaps didn’t expect me to ask for permission to bring the donkey along.

The black-and-white male donkey, 12, was dressed for the occasion and sported a pink floral headpiece

'He thought it was an unusual request but when I pointed out donkeys are God’s creatures too I think it convinced him - although he did insist on having someone to clean up after him.

'It was the best day, it all went so smoothly.

'It was relaxed, fun wedding where everyone helped out and I can’t thank them enough.'

The wedding was also a double celebration for Charlotte as she tied the knot on her 40th birthday.

She added: 'Matthew asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I said I wanted to get married.

'We had an amazing day and the kindness of all the guests was great.'

The couple, who have three daughters Jess, 20, KD and Josie, both 15 and sons Isaac, 11, and Jack, 15, are planning to go on honeymoon later in the year.

Reverend Neil Patterson said it was the first time he had married a couple with a donkey in the church.

He said: 'For a moment I did wonder if he would go up the steps but it was fine.

'It was a very pleasant wedding and I was pleased to take it.'
