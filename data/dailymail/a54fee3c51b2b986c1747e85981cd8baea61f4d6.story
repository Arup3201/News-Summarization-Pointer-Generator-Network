More than 1,400 desperate job hunters have applied for just 14 jobs at a cash-strapped police force - highlighting the chronic employment crisis sweeping Britain.

Staffordshire Police have been deluged with prospective candidates after they announced they were recruiting 14 officers for the first time in three years.

Staff have sent out a staggering 1,466 application packs to people who replied to the force's advert for roles.

Staffordshire Police has lifted its recruitment freeze - and been flooded with job applicants

It means there are more than 100 people chasing each vacancy which comes with a starting salary of just over £23,500.

Chief Constable Mike Cunningham - who has previously called for funding for new recruits - said he was pleased, but not surprised, by the level of interest.

He said: 'We were definitely expecting a lot of interest in these jobs. 

'The police service has always been seen as a good career and a vocation, especially among those who want to make a positive difference in their communities.

'The state of the economy has obviously played a part in generating this response, but even in times of plenty we get a lot of people applying to join the police.

'Having 100 applicants applying for each vacancy means we will be able to find the very best people for these jobs.

'Unfortunately that will mean some will be disappointed.'

The selection process for the new recruits is likely to take another two months.

A new PC earns £23,259-a-year on appointment, rising to £27,471 after two years in the job.

A recruitment freeze was imposed in February 2010, as the force looked to save £38 million by 2015.

Staffordshire Police and Crime 
Commissioner Matthew Ellis, who was elected last year, ended the 
recruitment freeze and the forced retirement of officers with 30 years' 
service.

The decisions mean Staffordshire Police have 50 more officers than they would have otherwise had by this time next year.

But the overall number is still expected to fall from 1,814 to 1,786 due to officers leaving and retiring.

The number of PCSOs is set to remain at 209, while police staff numbers are expected to fall from 1,153 to 1,135.

Staffordshire Police Federation 
chairman Andy Adams said: 'I think policing is still a career people are
interested in. We've had a list of people asking when the police will 
start recruiting again.

'I 
am really pleased that we've had such a good response to these new 
vacancies. I would like to see the overall number of officers to stay 
the same, rather than fall.

'The amount of crime doesn't fall, and so it means there is more work for those officers we do have.'

In a similar scenario, a new sofa shop which advertised just nine jobs was inundated with more than 1,200 applicants.

The new branch of furniture superstore DFS is due to open in Bristol on April 14 and had a handful of positions still available.

While people rushed for Staffordshire Police jobs, a desperate 4,000 job seekers flocked to a Hampshire hotel in the hope of finding work at a new shopping centre

But when it advertised the nine jobs 1,200 people applied - including 610 for one position as a warehouse assistant.

In total 79 people applied to be a salesman, 137 as a sales office administrator, 62 as a weekend sales office administrator, three as an upholsterer and 88 as a cleaner.

Another 42 people applied to be a warehouse manager, 610 as a warehouse assistant, 131 as a van driver and 70 as a co-driver.

The figures show the number of people competing to find work - even as official statistics say unemployment in the area is falling.

DFS regional controller Adam Hankinson said: 'We were surprised at first but this is a trend we have been witnessing around the country as new stores open.

'We understand this is a difficult time for people looking for jobs with the economy as it is.'

The situation is similar to the rush for jobs in Whitley.

Yesterday, 4,000 job seekers flocked to a hotel in the hope of finding work at a new £84 million shopping centre. 

Queues formed as people were desperate to try and get work. The desperate job hunt was echoed in Staffordshire

Long
queues started to build two hours before the jobs fair at the Solent 
Hotel, in Whiteley, Hampshire, as the work went up for grabs.

The
turn-out was so strong a one-in-one out policy was enforced, as eager 
job seekers tried to land employment the new shopping centre. 

As the unemployment catastrophe rumbles on, an international watchdog has predicted that the bleak outlook looks set to stay.

The
US and Japan will lead the recovery among advanced economies but the 
turnaround in Europe will take longer, The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development warned yesterday.

It said the outlook in the G7 is improving after the slump at the end of last year.

But it claimed that vast swathes of the eurozone remained deep in recession and urged the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to stimulate growth.

‘The global economy weakened again in late 2012, but activity is now picking up in many major economies,’ said Pier Carlo Padoan, the think tank’s deputy general secretary and chief economist.

‘The outlook in the first half of 2013 is for a return to moderate growth in the US and an acceleration from low levels in Japan.

‘In Europe, a meaningful recovery is likely to take somewhat longer. Within the euro area, there is a renewed divergence between growth in Germany, which is likely to pick up strongly, and that of other countries, which will remain slow or negative.’

The OECD forecast annual growth of 3.5pc in the US in the first quarter of 2013, 3.2 per cent in Japan and 2.3 per cent in Germany.

It said Britain would avoid a triple-dip recession, with annual growth of 0.5 per cent. But it said the French economy would decline by 0.6 per cent and the Italian economy by 1.6 per cent.

The Paris-based OECD said that output across the G7 fell at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 but predicted growth of 2.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent in the first and second quarters of 2013.

‘We are moderately more optimistic,’ said Padoan. ‘We see growth firming in the US, we see more growth in Japan, and we see more growth in Germany.’ He added that ‘some scope remains’ for the ECB to cut interest rates.
