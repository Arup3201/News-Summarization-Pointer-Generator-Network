Shot dead: Ronalee Deandre McGuire, pictured, was shot around 2.a.m. at his home in the 6000 block of Bobby Burns Street in Houston and police are searching for the suspect who they believe is the 19-year-old son of the victim's fiance

The shooting happened after a big family Christmas party at McGuire's grandmother's house.

Authorities said McGuire got into an argument with his fiance in a bedroom where the children, aged 9 to 12, were sleeping.

The fiance's son then came into the room and allegedly fatally shot McGuire, who worked for Verizon wireless.

'It's a hurting thing. Anytime you lose someone it hurts, especially like that,' Ardell Garrett, the victim's uncle, told KHOU.com.

McGuire died inside the home of one or more gunshot wounds. The children were not injured.

Just hours before the shooting, McGuire and about 75 other people were at the home celebrating Christmas.

Witnesses saw McGuire's fiance and an unknown male leave the location after they heard the gun shots.

'He was really close to his kids. I don't know why somebody would sit there and take his life,' family friend Greg Brooks told the station.Â

'He's my friend; it's a tragedy that someone like him, a good person like him, is dead now.'

The graduate of Texas Southern University also hosted a basketball league with the kids.

'It's hard to accept any kind of death like that. He was a father to his kids, a man that worked, took care of his kids, just a good honest man, worked and took care of his business like any young man supposed to,' said the victim's uncle.
