Arsenal have opened discussions over a £6.4million deal for Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Marcelo Brozovic.

The player's representative Miroslav Bicanic said he was to hold talks with Arsenal in November when Brozovic is expected to be in the Croatia squad to face USA at Craven Cottage.

However, initial talks were held on Thursday with Arsenal keen to fend off competition from Inter Milan for the 21-year-old.

Inter have already offered £3.5million which is well short of Zagreb's valuation and Arsenal hold the upper hand.

Brozovic is a versatile midfielder and Arsene Wenger wants him to play as a deep-lying playmaker who can screen the back four.

Arsenal have been looking at similar players but Paris St Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot has expressed a desire to join Roma while Real Madrid's Sami Khedira is keen to join Chelsea.

Wenger also wants a defender in January with Celtic's Virgil van Dijk and Hull left-back Andy Robertson among his possible targets.
