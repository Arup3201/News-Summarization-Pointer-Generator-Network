A Georgia barber is offering area parents a new way of punishing their misbehaving sons: by shaving off the top of their hair to make them look like balding old men.

Russell Frederick from A-1 Kutz in Snelville calls it his 'Benjamin Button Special' and offers it for free to kids who need to 'act grown.'

The 34-year-old father says he started advertising the unique punishment after using it successfully on his own 12-year-old son.

Not smiling anymore! A Georgia barber is offering free 'Benjamin Button Special' cuts for kids whose parents can no longer handle their naughty behavior

Frederick told the Washington Post that he came up with it after his son Rushawn's grades began to fall last fall. After the cut--named for the 2008 Brad Pitt film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button--he says Rushawn's marks 'skyrocketed dramatically.'

Interest in the offer also skyrocketed after Frederick posted before and after photos online of the first boy whose parents brought him in for the Benjamin Button.

The ornery boy initially looks to have not a care in the world but his smirk quickly goes away for the after photo.

Frederick told the Post that some naysayers have likened the punishment to abuse. 

'There are a few people that are saying it's emotional abuse; but on average, everyone is applauding,' he said.

Lots of interest: Russell offers the cut for free three days a week and says interest skyrocketed after he posted his first taker's before and after pictures on social media

Anyway, said Frederick, the punishment isn't meant for everyday use.

'I hope that most people won't have to do this unless it's an extreme circumstances and nothing else is working,' he said. 'First, you talk or implement your restrictions.

'But when the conventional ways don't work these days, you have to get creative.'

The first boy to get the special wasn't forced to walk out of A-1 Kutz with the crazy cut. Once the lesson set it, Frederick buzzed off his remaining hair for a more presentable look.

'He understood why it happened and he rolled with it and allowed it to make him stronger,' Fredrick said.
