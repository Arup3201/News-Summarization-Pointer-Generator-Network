Marouane Fellaini was left bloodied and bruised on Monday night, but the Manchester United midfielder had the last laugh as he helped his team to FA Cup victory against Preston North End.

The 27-year-old is no stranger to the risks of a stray elbow, but he was on the end of a hard challenge from Preston's Bailey Wright, which left him needing treatment from the United medical staff at the side of the pitch.

Undeterred, Fellaini went on to score United's second goal in a 3-1 win, after Ander Herrera had initially cancelled out Scott Laird's opener.

Wayne Rooney scored a late penalty to secure the 3-1 win and set up a quarter final tie with Arsenal, but Fellaini will still be nursing the effects of his first-half aerial battle with Wright.  

As the pair jumped to be first to a long ball, Wright's right elbow collided with Fellaini's eye, leaving the Manchester United midfielder in need of some help from the United physio.

It is not the first time Fellaini has been involved in a controversial incident of this nature, having twice escaped serious punishment for his own apparent elbows on opposition players.

While on international duty in November, the Belgian went unpunished for a challenge on Wales' Joe Allen, while last season he was only given a yellow card for an elbow on Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta.

In the match at Deepdale on Monday night, Australia international Wright was not booked by referee Phil Dowd for the challenge.
