A company has developed tracking devices for towels that alert managers to the whereabouts of their linen at all times.

The concept was initially designed to help keep an eye on linen as it left  hotels to be cleaned, but it is now proving a powerful preventative measure for robe raiders.

The new technology may be bad news for opportunistic thieves, but it's good news for hoteliers who lose up to 20 per cent of their linen every month. 

Linen Tracking Technology has designed a chip that alert hotel managers to the whereabouts of their linen

Most losses are though wear and tear, but two per cent are through theft, estimates William Serbin, executive vice president of Linen Tracking Technology, the company behind the tracking chip.

If you've  stolen a towel or robe from a hotel room, you are far from alone. A poll by myvouchercodes.co.uk found that 68 per cent of Britons cannot resist taking a towel or item of linen when they check out of a hotel.

That number is set to plummet, as 2,000 hotels now use the tracking technology although William Serbin won't name which.

He told MailOnline: 'Our properties like to remain anonymous. They benefit from the gained efficiency and don’t want to alarm guests that they have this technology.'

He revealed while there are no UK hotels currently using the chips  they plan to enter the UK market as soon as they find a partner and gain a license.

Linen Technology Tracking, a Miami-based company, has patented the chip  which, once inserted allows managers to real-time track each and every towel using UHF Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.

The tiny chip send signals to antennae positioned at the hotel's entrance or exit, letting owners know if a towel has left the property.

Towels are bendable, chips last up to 300 washes and tags can be read by sensors up to six feet away. 

As well as catching guests out, they are helpful for housekeeping if they want to find out when a towel has been removed from the wardrobe, so it can be restocked.

William says, 'Our solution not only provides total inventory information, but provides additional data like dwell time, wash count and laundry reconciliation which assists properties become more efficient.'

He estimates that, although each property is different, most save about $50,000 (£33,300) a year in lost linen. 

Although Linen Technology Tracking does not tell hoteliers the exact coordinates of a missing towel or robe, several thieves have successfully been  asked to return pilfered hotel property. 

'It's been phenomenal,' William also told CNN. 'The chips create a lot of conversation. When my friends travel, they'll call and ask, 'Are you guys at my hotel?'
