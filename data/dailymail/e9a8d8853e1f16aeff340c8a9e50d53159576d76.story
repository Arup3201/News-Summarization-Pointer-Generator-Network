Olympic withdrawl symptoms? Check. Missing Team GB already? Check. Need a sporting fix before the Paralympics begin next week? Check.

But before you check in with your nearest Olympics Anonymous chapter, take a peek at what some kindly and supremely creative Lego-lovers have done to keep us away from the edge this week.

The clever souls at Savage Steel's Minifigs have paid tribute to Team GB's gold medal-winning athletes by immortalising them in Lego.

SCROLL DOWN TO SEE 'DANGLEBORIS' AND THE WOOLYMPICS....

Several gleeful members of Lego Team GB celebrate winning a tremendous 29 gold medals - can you guess who is who? (Clue: sideburns)

London 2012 champions including middle distance runner Mo Farah, heptathlete Jessica Ennis, cyclists Sir Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins, Laura Trott and Jason Kenny, regatta stars Anna Watkins and Katherine Grainger, long jumper Greg Rutherford have all been remodelled as Lego figures at a tribute to their triumphant peformances.

(There's also a mini Usain Bolt thrown in among the Brits. Because, well, we love him a bit like he's our own, don't we?)

Behind the tribute figures are husband and wife team Caroline and Nick Savage who make customised Lego figures as a hobby.

Caroline told MailOnline: 'With the Olympics taking over our lives right now, our focus has been drawn away from frivolous things and towards the more meaningful. Seeing those thousands of proud folk cheering on their countries helps you remember what's important.

'That thing is Lego. Lego is important. Over at Minifigs, we've been celebrating the Olympics with style, making sure that the Team GB gold medal winners get a prize worth being proud of.

'Forget circular pieces of metal, post boxes and stamps. We'e making them into Minifigs. The greatest honour!'

And the couple have already gained some Olympic-sized fans.

Kate Copeland, Anna Watkins and Jade Jones have all expressed delight at being reimagined as Lego, and Greg Rutherford has even used his as the background on his Twitter page.

'Kate 
even phoned her mum to tell her!' said Caroline. 'So hopefully the athletes themselves 
will just be pleased to get their Lego!'

The Savages began their Olympic Lego adventure with heptathlete Jessica Ennis because, they explained, Ennis is a resident of Sheffield.

And while her husband Nick is the main design force behind the Lego athletes, Lego fanatic Caroline is, by day, a scientist in the MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics at the University of Sheffield.

In fact, such a devout Lego fan is she that she even uses it in her outreach programmes and demonstrations.

As well as Lego Olympic champions, 
the Savages create and sell bespoke Lego figures, be they footballers, pop idols, 
actors, other sporting heroes and even friends and family.

The figures are sold on their website for £10 to £15 each.

The Olympics may be over, but the Woolympics are only just beginning. Hurrah!

In another pocket-sized tribute to our greatest Team GB, four of our triumphant gold medalists have been have been spun into wooly figurines by Heather Brown, wife of thelondonist.com editor Matt Brown.

Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, Andy Murray and Bradley Wiggins have all been given a wooly makeover.

And there is a surprise political cameo: London Mayor Boris Johnson, reprising his Victoria Park zip wire hiccup in 'Dangleboris'.

The figurines stand between 6cm and 7cm tall, as can be seen from the cocktail stick javelin clutched by Jess Ennis.

The
original plan was to create fun-sized dolls of all Team GB's gold 
medalists, but the team was simply too successful and Heather soon ran out of both time and wool.
