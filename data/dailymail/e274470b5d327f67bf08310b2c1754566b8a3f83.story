Rumor has it Bill Clinton will finally publicly apologize to former mistress and shamed White House intern Monica Lewinsky for the way the Clinton political operation treated her after their affair a decade and a half ago.

For years Lewinsky has contended that that they engaged in a 'consensual relationship' despite being painted by Clinton and his allies as a 'stalker' during the scandal. She maintains in an essay published in Vanity Fair this week that it took two to tango.

Clinton may now make nice with Lewinsky more than 15 years later, the Chicago Sun-Times reports, to insulate former First Lady Hillary Clinton from the scandal should she seek the presidency in 2016.

Should Bill Clinton apologize for the Monica Lewinsky scandal?

In the Vanity Fair essay Lewinsky alleges she 'was made a 
scapegoat in order to protect [Bill Clinton's] powerful position.'

Lewinsky says she wishes the Clinton's 'no ill will' but wants to get her side of the story out should Hillary run and the affair become a topic of discussion again.

Throughout Hillary Clinton's 2008 candidacy, Lewinsky did not comment on the affair - though she says she was approached numerous times - because she did not want to hurt the Democratic Party.

This time around, she's speaking out.

‘I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past — and other people’s futures,’ Lewinsky writes.

'I did not have sexual relations with that woman,' then-President Bill Clinton claimed. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to stick with her husband even after truth came out

When the 
sex scandal was first reported in the press, Clinton infamously claimed,
 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.'

The world leader's lie lead to an impeachment trial that almost cost him his job.

He later admitted he 'misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that,' yet he never apologized for his actions.

The fallout of the scandal cost Lewinsky her reputation, something she says she was never truly able to rebuild.

Faced with the threat that Lewinsky has suddenly surfaced because she is out for revenge, the Sun Times suggests that Bill Clinton might seek to mitigate the havoc Lewinsky could wreak on his wife's political aspirations by apologizing for the pain and suffering his denial of the affair has caused the women throughout the years.

The Lewinsky affair has already become 2016 fodder.

Kelley Paul, wife to Kentucky Senator and presumed Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, deplored Bill Clinton's 'predatory, offensive' behavior in an interview with Vogue in January. She indicated that the affair could make Hillary damaged goods.

Senator Paul followed his wife's lead and derided Clinton for taking 'advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office.'

'There is no excuse for that and that is predatory behavior and ...  we shouldn’t want to associate with people who would take advantage of a young girl in his office,' Paul said, previewing the first of many sex-scandal related attacks Hillary could hear from Republicans next year.
