Sabrina and Savannah Russo of Pearland, Texas were found unresponsive on February 17, with Savannah dying later that day and Sabrina being taken off of life support late Sunday night.

Now, police are conducting an investigation and an autopsy is underway to figure out just what happened to the two girls, who were just 15-months old.

According to Fox 26, the girls' mother, Barbara Russo, their uncle and their older brother were home when the incident occurred. 

Both girls were rushed by Life Flight medical helicopter to Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital after their mother called 911.

It is still not known just how long the two girls were underwater.  

'My heart goes out to the family. I know that they're grieving,' said Judy Poston, one of the family's neighbors.

'The baby had very little brain activity so she's better off where she is.' 

Poston also said the Russo told her she was able to give Sabrina CPR after finding her in the tub.

According to KHOU, the parents had recently split, but were now back together.

They also said the family kept to themselves, with one neighbor describing them as 'just not your typical "can I borrow some sugar from you" kind of neighbor.'

Children's Protective Services is also investigating the incident, and said they had been involved with the family before and the older child, who is three-years-old.

He has been removed from the home and is now with family friends. 

'I hope that they can get through this together. I hope that eventually they can become strong. I know that you never ever get over the death of a child but with time hopefully they can get on with their lives,' said Poston. 

'It's very sad, not one baby, but two,' said Lene Owerbach, another neighbor. 

'I don't even know what to think it's going to be with them the rest of their lives. It must be devastating to them.'
