A mysterious illness which has killed 13 dogs since December has claimed the life of another.

The deadly canine disease - which so far has no name - begins with lesions on the lower legs and feet, followed by kidney failure between two and seven days later.

There have been five confirmed and seven unconfirmed toxin cases in the New Forest since December.

A mysterious deadly toxin which has killed 13 dogs in the New Forest since December has claimed another life. Flat-coated retriever Erin contracted the illness - which is similar to Alabama Rot

Erin contracted the illness at St Catherine's Hill near Christchurch, Dorset. Owner Tracy Graham said she had walked her pet there, with its mother Holly, her entire life - yet Holly has not been affected by the toxin

It
 is similar to Alabama Rot, which was first seen in the USA in the 1980s, because 
the symptoms suggest it was related to a toxin produced by E.coli 
bacteria.

The unexplained illness is triggered by the toxin which then causes acute kidney failure in dogs.

Flat-coated retriever Erin contracted the illness at St Catherine's Hill near Christchurch, Dorset.

Owner Tracy Graham said she had walked her pet there, with its mother Holly, her entire life - yet Holly has not been affected by the toxin.

But Ms Graham, from Christchurch, began to panic when she saw lesions appear on five-year-old Erin's skin under her foot.

She contacted the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) straight away and went directly to the vets where Erin had a blood test - but nothing showed.

But a follow up test came back positive for a high level of toxicity in her blood when they were told to go to a specialist centre in Winchester.

They put her straight onto a drip, but her condition worsened over the next couple of days.

Experts told Ms Graham that Erin would have to be taken to London to be placed on kidney dialysis, but by the time she had travelled to the centre to pick her beloved pet up, her condition had deteriorated even further.

It was then that mother-of-two Ms Graham made the heartbreaking decision to have her put down.

She said: 'It was a real shock. It was so sudden and unexpected.

'Her sore became really nasty but I couldn't find a thorn or anything anywhere as I thought she had become infected.

'Unfortunately nobody told me to get her blood tested every day after she became ill.

'It may have picked up the toxin earlier and who knows - she could have been saved.

'When she began vomiting I just said 'Please, put her down now'. It wasn't fair on poor Erin.

'We will go back up to the hill again but not until the summer - this Alabama Rot-like toxin seems to be a winter thing.

'Nobody thought this area would be affected but more and more places are starting to have it. I've been going there since I was a kid.

'You just don't know where you can go to walk your dog any more.'

Vet David Walker, of Anderson Moores in Winchester, Hampshire, said he had been in touch with military sources.

He is looking into whether the deaths were caused by leaked toxins from former RAF bases - but said it was 'unlikely' as the issue was widespread.

He said: 'Unfortunately, Erin didn't survive and the pathology was the same as other dogs that have died.

'The toxin is more a triggering agent and the lesions are generally a manifestation of the illness.'
