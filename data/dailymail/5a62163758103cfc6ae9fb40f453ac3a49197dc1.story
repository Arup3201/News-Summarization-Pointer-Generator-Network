Former Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish has backed Anfield as the perfect place for wild child striker Mario Balotelli to finally settle down.

Balotelli made the £16million move from AC Milan to Brendan Rogers’ side last month, making his debut as a substitute in Liverpool’s 3-0 triumph at Tottenham Hotspur.

Speaking at the launch of McDonald’s new community partnership with The Scottish FA, Dalglish predicted ‘entertaining times ahead’ for Balotelli.

And he believes the Italy international will thrive under the management of Rodgers, whose side finished second in the English Premier League last term.

‘Liverpool is the perfect place for him to go,’ said Dalglish, who managed Liverpool from 1985-1991 and again from 2011-2012.

‘It is a happy dressing room. He’s got a manager who is not confrontational but at the same time can instil discipline. So if he wants to settle down, I’m sure he will at Liverpool and that he’ll be a fantastic asset for the club.

‘I think there are entertaining times ahead. He’s a fantastic footballer. He will be fantastically received by those wonderful supporters and I’m sure he’ll make a huge contribution.’

Dalglish was also full of praise for a striker from the blue half of the city; Everton midfielder and fellow Scotsman Steven Naismith. In the week Scotland ran world champions Germany close in Dortmund, he feels Naismith’s early season form is indicative of a healthier Scottish game compared to five years ago.

He said: ‘Naismith’s had a great start to the season. He’s got his chance after an injury to Ross Barkley and he’s taken it well. There’s a few Scots doing well in the English Premier League at the moment, like James McArthur and Robert Snodgrass.

‘There’s better players coming through to the Scotland national team than there have been in the past five years and their performance in Germany was encouraging.’
