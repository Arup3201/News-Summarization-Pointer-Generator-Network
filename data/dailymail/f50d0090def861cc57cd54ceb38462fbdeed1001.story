A 28-year-old woman fed up with being catcalled is taking on her street harassers by confronting them and secretly filming their reactions.

Lindsey from Minneapolis aims to show the 'cumulative daily impact' of unwanted wolf whistles or sexual comments on women with a series of videos posted online.

In the clips, Lindsey asks the men to explain their sexist behavior - and is shocked at their defense.

'Where I come from, we holler at women. I'm sorry if that offends you, but you shouldn't feel that way because women are put on this earth to satisfy a man,' 'Jared' from Ohio says.

'If she feels offended, she should never have been born.'

Confronting street harassers: Lindsey was walking to work when two businessmen loudly faux-whispered 'Minnesota chicks are hot' her (one of the men is pictured). She explained to them they made her feel uncomfortable

Strange compliment: This stranger called Lindsey a 'b***h' when he walked by her and explained it meant 'sexy' when she confronted him

Keen: Lindsey said she was on her way to work this month when this man hollered at her from across the street

Lindsey, who refuses to provide her last name, posted her late night exchange with 'Jared' to YouTube on Thursday.

She said she was at a bus stop when 'Jared' solicited her. He continued to harass her when she refused him.

When she asked him why he wouldn't give up, he said he believed she was interested in him and that he 'wasn't going to stop what he was doing.'

He added: 'White women get offended when black men approach them.'

Lindsey responded: 'Listen, I'll yell at white men about this, I'll yet at women about this. The point is, I should be able to walk down the street, just like you should be able to walk down the street.'

Fed up: Lindsey said she'd been harassed numerous times in a five minute walk down Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis when she decided to confront catcaller 'Umar'

Lindsey has posted a number of similar exchanges online, telling Buzzfeed she starts conversations with catcallers to understand their motivation.

'I
 am genuinely interested in what place this is coming from,' she said.

'The theme I hear the most often is that
 they truly, genuinely think it’s a compliment, and they are shocked. If that is true, then simply telling people it’s not a 
compliment may go a long way...

'The filming provides them a platform to embarrass themselves in a way that they’ve already embarrassed me.'

The young woman began posting the videos this week, after a stranger touched her hair and called her 'blondie' on an escalator.

When she told the man he 'could just say hi', he yelled at her and called her ugly.

Astonished at the bizarre reaction and wanting to do something about it, Lindsey has also created a series of pocket-sized cards which explains why catcalling is inappropriate.

'Cards Against Harassment'

Cards Against Harassment: Lindsey has created 10 sample cards which are on her website designed to explain to catcallers why their behavior is offensive

'Minnesota chicks are hot'  

She has handed out at least 30 cards this summer, seizing opportunities to educate catcallers on their bad behavior. However she notes on her website that they shouldn't be used in situations where a woman feels unsafe. 

'Being harassed by strangers isn't fun, but now, responding to street harassment can be,' the website says about the cards.

Other exchanges Lindsey has filmed include a man who called her a 'b***h' before explaining it meant sexy, and two businessmen who loudly muttered 'Minnesota women are hot' at her as she walked by.
