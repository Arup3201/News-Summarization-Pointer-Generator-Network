For the man who has everything, it could be the ultimate way to protect your most treasured possessions.

The £80,000 ($128,000) Fortress, made by German company Döttling, even boasts a built-in humidor for keeping cigars safe, and a watch drawer that will wind the timepieces it protects.

The safe even comes with a million dollar guarantee for its contents - and is covered with calfskin to make sure it fits into any well decorated living room.

Only ten of the Fortress safes will be made - and they are certified for insurance claims of upto a million dollars

The firm behind the Fortress said it 'introduces a new era of security'.

It is ready for connection to a burglar alarm including a 'silent alarm' function and, in this configuration, provides tested and certified insurance cover of up to US $1,000,000.

It claims all of the features can be customised for each buyer - but refuses to reveal how much it costs.

'The edition is limited, but the possibilities are boundless,' it says.

'We designed the interior of the high-security safe, of which only a limited edition of ten per securityclass exist, with the objective of maximum versatility.'

Among its features the Fortress includes eight watch winders and a humidor.

Using specially designed software, each watch winder is individually controlled, and owners can set the amount and even direction of winding.

Inside the safe there is also a humidor made of original Spanish cedar, with an electronic humidifying system show the owners information about the conditions their cigars are in.

The safe can be built with extra top compartments to house watches, which are automatically wound, and a computer controlled humidor for keeping cigars in their optimum condition

When fully 'locked down' the safe can be connected to a home's burglar alarm system so it can silently alert police if attempts are made to open it

The exterior of the safe has also been made from luxurious materials, and the firm boasts: 'All of these intrinsic values require, of course, that the outer appearance of the Fortress liveup to them.

'Therefore the corpus of the safe is handsomely upholstered with finest calfskin.

'And since individuality is a given at Döttling, the Fortress is also available in other configurations and color combinations upon request.'

The safe can be customised for each owner's needs - with only ten of each version being made. The firm has not revealed the price of the safe

The calfskin-covered designed features retro looking clocks and switches - but also contains the latest electronic sensors
