A 22-year-old glamour model dubbed France's Kim Kardashian has been arrested for allegedly trying to murder her boyfriend in a heated row.

Swiss-born Nabilla Benattia was being held at Paris police station today after fellow reality TV star Thomas Vergara was stabbed repeatedly in the throat and chest.

He was today in a ‘serious condition’ in the Georges Pompidou hospital in central Paris, while Ms Benattia was also treated for severe shock.

Arrested: French reality star Nabilla Benattia, who has been dubbed the nation's answer to Kim Kardashian, was taken into custody after her boyfriend Thomas Vergara was stabbed repeatedly in the throat and chest

A police spokesman confirmed that Ms Benattia was being held ‘for suspected attempted murder’ and was being questioned at length.

She was originally arrested for ‘assault and battery’ but the allegation was upgraded when prosecutors saw Mr Vergara’s wounds, said the spokesman. 

Officers were called to their hotel room in the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt at 2.30am after staff reported a ‘major argument with lots of screaming’.

Ms Benattia, whose mother is Italian and father is Algerian, was arrested after firefighters got into the couple’s room.

She is said to have raised the alarm by calling reception, saying that three men had attacked Mr Vergara outside the hotel.

This version of events is disputed by staff and police, however, who say nothing was seen on CCTV, and there was no evidence of Mr Vergara’s blood outside the hotel.

‘Her version of events is incoherent’, said an investigating source. ‘It is not backed up by the initial evidence’.

A knife is believed to have been thrown out of the hotel room window and had been wiped clean, said the source.

Mr Vergara has told police that he does not want to file charges against Ms Benattia, although he may have to give evidence against her.

Ms Benattia, who is thought to have denied any wrongdoing, can be held for up to 48 hours.

The couple are household names in France after both appearing in the same TV show – ‘The Reality TV Angels’.

Its producer, Jeremy Michalak, said he was ‘in a state of shock’, adding: ‘I don’t know what happened. I’ve been trying to contact Nabilla.’ 

Ms Benattia, who has DD-sized breast implants, spent a month in detention as a minor over a fraud conviction in Switzerland.

Last year she was arrested in France for allegedly spitting at a railway worker.

Known popularly as ‘The Bimbo’, she has since launched her own short-lived reality TV show, featuring her family, as well as a line of clothes.

She was voted the most disliked person in France in a survey conducted for Voici magazine last year.

Her last public message, at 9.30pm yesterday, told her 1.1million Twitter followers in Arabic-French slang: 'I love you guys a lot I swear!!!'
