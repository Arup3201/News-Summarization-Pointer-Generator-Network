Police in DeLand report that two officers spotted Zimmerman and his dog parked behind Pompano Pat's, a motorcycle and gun store, on Sunday shortly after midnight and approached him

The manager of a Florida business where George Zimmerman was recently questioned by police has denied that Zimmerman was ever hired to provide security, despite his claims otherwise to authorities.

Police in DeLand report that two officers spotted Zimmerman and his dog parked behind Pompano Pat's, a motorcycle and gun store, on Sunday shortly after midnight and approached him.

Zimmerman, who was acquitted last summer of the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, told officers that the owner had given him permission to be there to provide security after a recent burglary, according to the police report

No citations were issued because 
'There was no evidence to support that a crime had occurred or was about
 to occur,' Officer Jessica Mayo wrote in the report.

Zimmerman 'in no way, shape or form' is employed by the store, Pompano Pat's manager Sam Porter said on Tuesday.

'He's not being paid to be act as a security officer or in any other way for Pompano Pat's,' Porter said.

Porter confirmed that the store had a burglary about two weeks ago, with 10 rifles stolen. He said that internal store security was 'beefed up' after the incident, but that no after-hours security personnel were hired.

The owner of Pompano Pat's, a friend of Zimmerman, has denied that he every hired Zimmerman to provide security for his gun and motorcycle store

Porter said that Johnson knew Zimmerman and had a friendship with him but wouldn't elaborate further.

Zimmerman became a national figure during his second-degree murder trial last year for fatally shooting the Martin during an altercation in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012. 

The case raised questions about race and self-defense laws in America.

Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, was acquitted last July in the shooting of Martin, who was black.

Zimmerman filed an appeal this week in a defamation lawsuit against NBC Universal and three reporters.

Last month, a judge dismissed Zimmerman's lawsuit, saying the former neighborhood watch leader had failed to show that the network acted with malice.

In his lawsuit, Zimmerman says NBC's editing of a story about the shooting made it sound as if he voluntarily told a phone operator that Martin was black.
