When the Nichol family was invited to a wedding at Lake Como in Italy, I was rather hopeful I might catch a glimpse of the celebrity-strewn nuptials of George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin who, at the time, were widely rumoured to be preparing to tie the knot on the shores of this most beautiful holiday destination.

Inexplicably, they decided to wed in Venice - so my wife Suzie, daughter Sophie and I were able to focus fully on the equally delightful, and paparazzi-free, marriage of our close friends Jo and Mark.

After landing at Milan Malpensa, and an hour's stomach-churning car journey around the endlessly winding roads that border the lake, we arrived at Lenno, a small village on the west bank of the lake, some 17 miles north of Como itself.

An absolute beauty: Lake Como, with the little town of Bellagio adorning its shore, is a true Italian wonder

The Hotel Albergo Lenno occupies an enviable spot directly on the tree-lined promenade and opposite Bellagio, one of the most famous and picturesque towns on the lake.

Our room was large, clean and comfortable with two balconies offering the most incredible views of the lake and surrounding mountains. It was a real delight to gaze out across the shimmering waters to the steepsided, verdant hillsides and watch the ferries ply their trade.

A few of the more affluent tourists clearly had money to burn, so came and went by seaplane.

As befits a small, family-run hotel, the Albergo Lenno staff were extremely friendly and efficient - small things such as printing out airline boarding passes, helping with translations and booking taxis and trains were all done with a smile.

The Y-shaped Lake Como is nearly 30 miles long and divides into two branches at Bellagio. Como sits on the south-western tip, Lecco on the south-east. The crystal-clear waters plunge to 1,300ft in parts, making this one of the deepest lakes in Europe.

A different part of Italy entirely: George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin married in Venice in late September

Lake Como is an incredibly popular resort and, though they could easily be something of a tourist-trap in peak season, I was mightily impressed by the shoreside restaurants and bars where staff were friendly and prices reasonable.

Using a phrase book and pidgin Italian, I managed to order up a veritable feast for dinner including fresh, crisp pizzas, large plates of delicious pasta, and wonderful bruschetta liberally dosed with garlic, basil and tomatoes. It was simple fare but very well done and staggeringly good value at just €49 (about £38) - and that included copious beer, wine and soft drinks.

A boat trip around the lake took us past the luxurious villas of the rich and famous.

Richard Branson is rumoured to own one and, apparently, another villa appeared on The X Factor's 'judges' houses' section of the show.

The truly magnificent Villa del Balbianello, built for Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini at the end of the 18th century, has starred in many films including Casino Royale with Daniel Craig.

Standing on the tip of a steep promontory overlooking the lake, the sweeping gardens and high walls give this fabulous mansion a real air of a Bond villain lair.

Making do with a non-celebrity wedding: The Nichol family were denied a glimpse of the Clooneys

Sadly, the time for sightseeing was limited as we had to don our finery for the wedding. The ceremony and reception were held on the shore of the lake. Bathed in sunshine, the backdrop of jagged peaks, passing boats, gleaming water and beautiful hillside villas provided a truly stunning location for such a memorable event.

As the sun set over the lake, the wine flowed and the laughter and dancing became slightly more raucous. It may have been a celebrity-free wedding, but the Nichol family were more than happy to have been invited and to experience the splendour and majesty of Lake Como.

British Airways (www.ba.com) offers return flights from Heathrow to Milan from £110 and can arrange car hire.

Hotel Albergo Lenno (www.albergolenno.com) reopens on March 13. Double rooms cost from €80 (£63) including breakfast.
