When it comes to tracking down the perfect pair of jeans, there is no other piece of clothing that induces so much stress.

As well as adhering to the style of the season (flared? skinny? boyfriend?), women want jeans that flatter their bottom, suck in their tummy and make their legs look longer.

Perhaps, then, it comes as little surprise that a recent study by Tampax Compak Pearl found that 40 per cent of women struggle to find the perfect fit - and 15 per cent have even been reduced to tears in their efforts.

New research reveals that 40 per cent of women struggle to find the perfect fit of jeans - but there is an exact formula for finding a pair to suit your shape. If, like Kim Kardashian, you're a pear shape, high-waisted look best

But, according to a celebrity denim expert, there is a tried-and-tested formula to finding the perfect pair to flatter - and it's all about your body shape.

Jean queen, Donna Ida Thornton, whose designs are worn by the likes of Millie Mackintosh, has devised some denim-buying hacks.

If you have a boyish shape - similar to Cara Delevingne, left, and Cameron Diaz, right,  you can wear most styles, according to denim expert Donna Ida Thornton but add shape with some zip detailing like Cara

If you have a boyish shape - similar to Cara Delevingne and Cameron Diaz - you can wear most styles, according to Donna. 

'Add some shape and interest with zips and details on back pockets,' she suggests for women with this figure. 

Pear-shaped women, who, like Kim Kardashian, have a smaller top half than bottom and boast fuller hips and a shapely lower half, should opt for high-waisted jeans.

'Look for skinny jeans in a high waisted style - it elongates the leg and slims down the hip,' said Donna.

If, like Lena Dunham, you possess an apple shape you should opt for elasticated waistbands.

Women with apple body shapes, which are larger across their mid-section, typically with slimmer legs, should look for plenty of stretch in a straight leg in a dark wash as they complement every curve, advises Donna.

Ladies with long legs, like supermodels Candice Swanepoel, left, and Karlie Kloss, right, look best in a mid to low rise to keep the waist at the right height, says Donna

Ladies with long legs, like supermodel Karlie Kloss, often struggle to find jeans that fit their stomach and their pins.

Sharing her advice, Donna said: 'Ladies with long legs look best in a mid to low rise to keep the waist at the right height, whereas petite girls look great in a high rise that accentuates the waist and elongates the legs.'

Revealing other essential tips for buying jeans, she explained that if jeans go on easily, go down a size. 

'Kicking your way into the legs isn’t unusual, and the waistband should be snug, if you can fit two fingers down the back that’s good, a whole hand is not,' she said.

When buying jeans with super stretch, she suggests looking for good quality denim that has great memory. 

'The "memory" is how quickly the denim springs back after wear,' she explains. 'Buy them firm but not overly tight. If you have "seam strain" down the legs, they are possibly too tight and this could damage the stretch.' 

She also explains that a curved or pieced waistband is ideal for flattering all shapes. 'This will be slightly higher at the back than the front and will curve into your waist rather than sit straight up,' she said.

Once you've chosen the perfect pair of jeans, Donna says it's essential to read the care instructions. 

She added: 'Most premium jeans are best washed COLD, that’s cold and not 30 degrees. Any warmer and you are damaging the fabric.'
