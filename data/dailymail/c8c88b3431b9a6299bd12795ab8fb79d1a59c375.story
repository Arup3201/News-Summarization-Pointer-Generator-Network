The month-long search for a missing University of Florida student has ended with a grisly discovery in the woods.

Christian Aguilar, 18, of Miami, was last seen on September 20 at a Gainesville Best Buy store with his alleged killer, Pedro Bravo.

It is believed that the two men had been fighting over a girl.

Grim discovery: Christian Aguilar's body was found in this area of Levy County, Florida, by two hunters who had been following the scent of death

Mr Aguilar’s disappearance sparked a statewide search as family members hoped and prayed that he would be found alive.

But on Friday, two hunters found what 
is believed to be his body in a wooded area in Levy County after they 
investigated an unusual smell, thinking it would lead them to a dead 
animal.

One of the hunters, who was not 
identified, told WSVN: 'So we followed the smell and when we got to 
wherever the smell was coming from, we realised that it wasn’t an animal
 – it was a human body. It was face down in the dirt.'

Police and Mr Aguilar’s anguished 
parents believe that the dead man is their son, and put a wreath in the 
spot where the body was found on Sunday.

Police have not yet confirmed that the
 remains are Mr Aguilar, who is a freshman at the University of Florida.
 Official identification and autopsy results are pending.

His father, Carlos Aguilar, said 
during a news conference on Sunday: "I just want to make sure that 
everybody knows that our prayers have been heard.

He added that when police confirm that
 the body is indeed his son, 'we are going to have the honour of taking 
Christian back home and have his funeral.'

Pedro Bravo was arrested last month, 
and charged with murder and kidnapping after he admitted that he beat Mr
 Aguilar until he was bloody, swollen and barely breathing.

Police began to suspect Bravo after Mr
 Aguilar’s backpack was found stashed inside a closet at Bravo's home 
and his car tested positive for blood.

Bravo purchased duct tape and shovel 
'several days' before Aguilar went missing, and gave police conflicting 
stories about a fight the two had before he stopped speaking to 
investigators.
