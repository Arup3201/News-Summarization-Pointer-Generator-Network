Leyton Orient are interested in Italian coach Serse Cosmi becoming their new manager. 

The 56-year-old has coached at Pescara, Siena, Lecce and Palermo in recent seasons and has worked before with sporting director Mauro Milanese.  

The League One strugglers controversially lost Russell Slade to Cardiff this month.

Serse Cosmi, formerly of Pescara, Siena, Lecce and Palermo, could be the next Leyton Orient manager

Russell Slade left the League One club to take over at Cardiff earlier this month

It is thought Cosmi wants to learn more about English football, while another Italian coach Giancarlo Camolese is also under consideration.

Orient signed free agent and former Siena striker Gianvito Plasmati, 31, on Sunday.
