A hotshot doctor who disappeared after failing to show up for work  was located in a small Texas city 60 miles from her home on Sunday afternoon.

Dr Fehintola Omidele, 25, who goes by the nickname FT, disappeared after being seen by her family over dinner at their Houston home last Sunday night.

KHOU reports that Dr Omidele phoned her sister around 1pm today to tell her she is in El Campo, Texas, and that she is safe.

Found: Dr Fehintola Omidele, or 'FT', phoned her sister from El Campo, Texas, on Sunday to tell her where she was and that she was safe 

The circumstances of her disappearance are not yet clear. 

El Campo is a city about 70 miles southwest of Houston. 

Her family became worried after she failed to show up for work on Monday at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, where she is a first-year resident.

Fox News reported her family found her cell phone at her apartment in Katy, Texas, but could not locate her car or purse. 

An intensive search by family and friends had failed to turn up FT or her grey Toyota Camry.

Dr Omidele enjoyed a glittering academic career, graduating from high school at 16 with a grade point average of 4.3, before graduating from college at the age of 20.

'She's extremely responsible, so her not showing up for work and it's been four or five days, is not like her at all,' family friend Dr Omonele Nwokolo told KHOU.

Another friend, A'Lys Lawrence, told MailOnline: 'We are broken hearted and doing all that we can to bring her back home safely.'  

Star doctor: FT graduated from high school at 16 with a 4.3 grade point average and graduated college at 20

Hailing from Nigeria, her family moved to New Orleans when she was eight, then to Katy, Texas, when she was 12.

According to the Houston Chronicle, she graduated high school with a 4.3 grade point average - out of a possible 5.0 - at the age of 16.

She was 20 when she enrolled in graduate medical school after majoring in biology and child development at the University of Texas.

'Extremely responsible': Friends claim FT's disappearance earlier this week is completely out of character

In a profile done on Dr Omidele in April, she told the Chronicle: 'I've always loved children. I'm drawn to them. Personally, I consider myself a kid at heart. In college, I worked at the child development center.'

She graduated in May, when she started her three-year pediatrics placement at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston.

One day, she said, she hopes to work for the French non-governmental organization Doctors Without Borders.
