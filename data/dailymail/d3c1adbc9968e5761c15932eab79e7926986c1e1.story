A couple watched on helplessly as their family car plunged into a canal during a family boat trip.

Sharon and Duncan Hall were horrified when the handbrake on their people carrier failed and the car rolled into the Bridgewater Canal, near Manchester.

The couple were at the Boothstown Marina in Salford for a boat trip to celebrate the 49th wedding anniversary of Duncan’s parents.

They had parked at the canal-side car park and were just about to board the boat when they turned to see the Volkswagen Touran sinking.

Duncan, 40, said: 'It was like something from You’ve Been Framed - but it wasn’t funny.

'The boat trip was a surprise for my mum and dad.

'I parked up, locked up and we were ready to get on board when I heard my wife shout "the car!".'

Watery rescue: The Volkswagen Touran was carefully winched out of the canal by a crane

Not hopeful: The couple, who were about to embark on a boating trip before the accident, do not think their car can be salvaged

'It was already halfway in the canal.'

Quick-thinking staff from Karen’s Boat Hire at the marina tied a rope around the roof rack and pulled it from the water before it could sink entirely.

The waterlogged car was towed by a barge and then winched out of the canal by a crane sent by their insurance company.

The recovery firm found that the handbrake was on but it was faulty.

The couple, from Eccles, are now waiting to find out if the car can be salvaged following the accident at 9.15am on Sunday.

Duncan, a yard worker, and Sharon, a 42-year-old marketing supervisor, bought the car for £6,500 last summer.

They use it to get to work and for their children Leah, 20, Jack, 15, and 18-month-old Ellie.

Duncan added: 'I think it’s beyond repair because of the water damage and because the crane had to smash the windows to hoist it out.

'But I’d like to thank Karen’s Boat Hire. Without their quick thinking it would have been on the bottom of the canal.'
