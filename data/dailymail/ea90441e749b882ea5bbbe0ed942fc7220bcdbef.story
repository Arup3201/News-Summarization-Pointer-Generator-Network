The owner of a Westborough, Massachusetts self-storage
company allegedly took out his frustration on a Verizon worker on Monday by
trapping him in an underground vault.

Howard Cook, 71, was not arrested, but will be summoned to
court to face charges including kidnapping in connection with the
incident in which he’s accused of slamming shut the top of an electrical box,
turning it into an airtight tomb for the worker who was still inside.

The Verizon technician, Michael Hathaway, used his cell
phone to call for help and managed to escape the box he says he was imprisoned
inside all because of the way he parked his van.

Snapped: Howard Cook allegedly snapped when Michael Hathaway parked his Verizon van on Cook's grass and then locked him in this airtight underground electrical vault

Trapped: Police say Cook then piled these 10-pound rocks on top of the hatch, effectively turning the airtight vault into a tomb

Hathaway, 45, was doing work in the underground electrical
vault that services an industrial park near Westboro Self-Storage, which is
owned by Cook.

Hathaway put in a desperate call to 911 and said he was
running out of air and couldn’t find a way out after the only route in or out
was shut and had two ten pound rocks piled on top.

Hathaway said Cook was enraged that he parked his Verizon
van on the grass next to the vault.

‘Some guy started screaming at me to move the van,’ Hathaway
said in his breathless call for help. ‘He closed the door on me, now I’m
trapped down here.’

Shocked: Reporters looking for Cook at his Westborough, Massachusetts home found only his wife, who said she's shocked her husband is accused of the bizarre crime

Rescued: Hathaway was able to call 911 from a cell phone and police arrived quickly to Westboro Self-Storage and helped him out of the vault. Cook now faces felony charges including kidnapping

Police arrived about 10 minutes later.

‘The container that he was in was running out of oxygen and
when the hatch was closed, it didn’t allow any more oxygen to get in,’
Westborough Police Sergeant Jonathan Kalagher told WBZ. ‘So, it was time
sensitive to get to him.’

Cook, meanwhile, says the whole situation was blown out of
proportion.
