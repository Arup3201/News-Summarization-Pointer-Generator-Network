A growing number of American Jews consider themselves Jewish by race and culture but less so by religion, according to the wide-spanning survey.

One in five - 22 per cent - of Jewish Americans say they 
have 'no religion' showing a trend towards secular Jewish identity in 
the U.S., the report finds.

In the total U.S. adult population, people who describe themselves as Jewish when asked about their religion account for just 2 per cent.

Fewer Jewish Americans consider themselves to be religious, but are proud of their cultural roots, a wide-ranging survey has revealed

The survey, by the Washington-based Pew Research Center, found that those with a direct Jewish ancestry who would describe themselves as atheist, agnostic or having 
no particular religion, appears to be on the rise.

The results show that this trend that appears to be growing among younger American Jews.

As much as 93 per cent of older American Jews, those born between 1914 and 1927, said they were Jews by religion. But this proportion steadily declines the younger the age of the respondents.

More than one in five American Jews say they have no religion, according to research

Among 'Boomer' Jews, born between 1946
and 1964, 81 per cent described themselves as Jewish by religion, and 
for Millennial Jews, born after 1980, the figure was down to 68 per 
cent.

'This shift in Jewish 
self-identification reflects broader changes in the U.S. public. 
Americans as a whole – not just Jews – increasingly eschew any religious
affiliation,' the report, titled 'A Portrait of Jewish Americans,'  states.

It underlines that percentage of American Jews who describe themselves as having no religion reflects the national average for adults with no religion.

Jews with no religion, often referred to as cultural or secular Jews, often tend to be less connected to Jewish organisations and are less likely to raise their children as Jewish.

Among religious Jews, more than 90 per cent with young children were raising them as Jewish or partially Jewish. Whereas among none-religious Jews, this figure fell to around 33 per cent.

Religious Jews are far more likely to marry other Jews, with only 36 per cent having a spouse who was not Jewish.

None-religious Jews are far more likely to marry outside of their Jewish culture - 79 per cent.

Only 20 per cent of intermarried parents were raising their children Jewish by religion, versus 96 per cent among dual- Jewish parents.

The report found that intermarriage rates among American Jews had risen significantly over the last 50 years.

Before
1970, the percentage of Jews with a none-Jewish spouse stood at 17 per 
cent. Between 2005 and 2013 the figure has risen to 58 per cent.

'It
is not clear whether being intermarried tends to make U.S. Jews less 
religious, or being less religious tends to make U.S. Jews more inclined
to intermarry, or some of both,' the report says.

It
adds: 'Whatever the causal connection, the survey finds a strong 
association between secular Jews and religious intermarriage.'

The survey found a trend toward more younger Jews having no religious identity, than older members of the community

Increasingly, Jewish people are marring non-Jewish people, the survey also found

Reform Judaism remains the largest denomination, accounting for 35 per cent, while Orthodox is one of the smallest, at 10 per cent.

While a relatively small population, Orthodox families tend to be larger, implying that this denomination is likely to grow faster than others.
