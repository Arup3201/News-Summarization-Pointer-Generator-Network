The number of Islamist extremists fighting for ISIS could double after al-Qaeda's 15,000 strong offshoot in Syria is said to have pledged allegiance to the militant group.

The merger is believed to have taken place in Albu Kamel - on the border of Syria and Iraq, where all of the crossings are currently in the hands of Sunni militia, many of them members of ISIS.

In April the al-Nusra Front pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who has previously condemned ISIS' brutal attempts to establish an Islamic state in the Middle East as too extreme, so the development points to a new split within al-Qaeda's ranks.

Sealed with an embrace: The 15,000 fighters al-Nusra is believed to have under its control could now switch to ISIS. This would double the number of militants ISIS previously claimed to have under its command

Blast: A suicide bombing today at a checkpoint manned by Kurdish security forces in Kirkuk killed two members of the Kurdish security forces as well as killing and wounding dozens of others

News of the merger between ISIS and the al-Nusra front were made by both the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and an Islamist website this afternoon.

Images widely shared by ISIS supporters online appeared to show al-Nusra's alleged leader in the Albu Kamel region, Abu Yusuf al-Masri, embracing ISIS fighters after apparently taking an oath of allegiance.

Ayman al-Zawahiri, the overall leader of al-Qaeda, has previously disowned ISIS and proclaimed the al-Nusra Front as its official Syrian affiliate.

ISIS which seized Iraq's main northern city 
Mosul on June 10, has since marched virtually unopposed towards Baghdad 
and is in control of major border posts on the frontier with Syria.

Only today violence continued, as a suicide bombing at a checkpoint in Kirkuk killed two members of the 
Kurdish security forces as well as killing and wounded dozens of 
others.

The group also controls large parts of eastern Syria, where it has both clashed with rival rebels groups - including al-Nusra - and has occasionally fought alongside them.

U.S. intelligence warned of the growing threat posed by Sunni insurgents in Iraq at the start of the year but the advice was ignored, a senior official has claimed.

The allegations, made by an unidentified official and reported by Fox News, contradict claims made by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry yesterday that ISIS' growth could not have be foreseen.

In a briefing, the official claimed the U.S. had given 'strategic warnings' to Iraq about the threat posed by Islamist groups.

'We routinely highlighted [ISIS'] growing threat in Iraq, the increasing difficulties Iraq’s security forced faced in combating [ISIS], and the political strains that were contributing to Iraq’s declining stability,' he said.

Yesterday John Kerry, who has been in the Middle East this week, gave an alternative account of the threat, claiming 'people were surprised everywhere' by ISIS' progress in the country.

The
 U.S. and Iraq did not sign a formal agreement allowing troops to stay 
in the country past 2011, so 'we didn't have eyes in there,' he said.

'But the Iraqis didn't even have a sense of what was happening [either]' Kerry added.

The cycle of creation and breakdown of these loose alliances has complicated the three-year-old insurgency against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as rebel infighting led to thousands of deaths and allowed the government to reclaim territory.

The fact al-Nusra has now pledged allegiance to ISIS almost certainly suggests the latter has emerged as the dominant rebel group.

An internal report of ISIS' activities last year put its total number of fighters in Iraq and Syria at 15,000. With al-Nusra boasting a similar sized or possibly even larger force, today's merger could double the total number of militant Sunni Islamists fighting under the ISIS banner in the Middle East.

Speaking of the merger, Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory of British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said: 'It is very important because Nusra is strong in Albu Kamal'.

This afternoon Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki rejected calls for a 'salvation government' to save Iraq from the growing threat of ISIS.

Speaking in his weekly television address, Maliki said growing calls for him to step aside to allow others to counter the Sunni insurgency represented a 'coup against the constitution and an attempt to end the democratic experience'.

Maliki's defence of his abilities come in response to appeals - led by the U.S. - for Iraq's government to to rise above ethnic divisions and form a united front against rebel forces.

Anti-ISIS: Hundreds gathered in Iran's capital Tehran this morning to protest against the Sunni insurgency in neighbouring Iraq

The
 developments come as ISIS continue to try to take control of Balad 
Airbase, Iraq’s largest airfield - which still contains dozens of 
military aircraft left over from the U.S. occupation.

There are also said to be Russian-built surveillance planes and helicopters on the site.

Although
 the majority of the aircraft are not in working order, many of them 
could easily be fixed - and with an estimated £1.2billion in ISIS' 
hands, the group are more than capable of covering the cost.

As
 the country has no real air force, Iraqi officers say without foreign 
air support they are on an equal footing with ISIS fighters. If ISIS 
were able to assemble some semblance of an air force of their own, this 
would give them a distinctive advantage in the battle for control of 
Iraq.

Islamist jihadists will sweep through Afghanistan as ruthlessly as in Iraq and Syria if the West fails to ‘wake-up’ to the danger, a former head of the military has warned.

Brutal extremists could capture huge swathes of the war-torn country when UK and US troops leave in December after 13 years of war, said Lord Richards of Herstmonceux.

He said it would be a ‘tragic waste’ if insurgents seized control of the battle-scarred nation. In total, the conflict has cost 453 British lives and around £20billlion of taxpayers’ money.

Warnings: A Kurdish peshmerga fighter takes his position behind a wall on the front line with militants from the al-Qaida-inspired Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Tuz Khormato, a town in an oil-rich part of Iraq

General Lord Richards, who retired as Chief of the Defence Staff last year, spoke out as fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) terror group, whose barbaric tactics and cold-blooded executions have provoked international outrage, edged closer to Baghdad.

Nato has a current strength in Afghanistan of more than 52,000 soldiers, including some 5,300 British personnel.

It plans to keep a slimmed down force - including 500 UK personnel - there after 2014 to train and advise local forces.

But there are fears the reduction in troops will spark a security crisis, raising the prospect of the Taliban re-seizing power.

General Lord Richards warned events in Iraq could be repeated in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of international forces unless the government in Kabul was given the support it needed.

He told Sky News: ‘We should say “What do you need?” and, collectively with other nations, provide what that is for fear that if we don't we will see what is happening in Iraq happening there in nine months’ time and that will be a tragic waste because it's not necessary.

‘What I am very clearly saying is, please finish off Afghanistan properly and meet our commitments made in good faith. That may need a bit more than governments are currently contemplating but Iraq is a wake-up call.

‘I fear what we are seeing in Syria and Iraq could happen in Afghanistan next year and the thing we should be focusing on now is containing this crisis.’

He said Afghan forces did not need help from combat forces, but the ‘more sophisticated parts’ of an armed forces – logistics, aircraft and command and control.

General Lord Richards has said militant jihadism is the ‘biggest threat confronting the free world’.He said it was vital to give political, economic, financial and security support to countries, such as Nigeria, that were under threat from Islamist radicals.

His remarks were at odds with those made by Defence Minister Mark Francois at a conference staged by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank on Wednesday.

Giving a keynote speech, Mr Francois said coalition forces had done a ‘hugely impressive job’ in Afghanistan.

He said it was now a country with a ‘capable Afghan security force – able to provide security for their own people… a country that is neither a safe haven nor a launch-pad for those terrorists who seek to attack our way of life.’

General Lord Richards said the crisis in Iraq had been fuelled by the West’s botched attempts to back the moderate opposition forces in Syria without providing decisive assistance to toppled President Bashar al-Assad.

Last year, Prime Minister David Cameron suffered a humiliating Commons defeat over authorising military action against the tyrant.

The Peer said: ‘If you're going to act to help a cause in another country, you have to do it properly. What we did in Syria collectively was enough to keep the war alive but not enough to solve it. Now it has spread into Iraq.’

He also said the invasion of Iraq by British and American forces was a ‘strategic error’ directly responsible for the crisis now threatening to tear the country apart.

He said: ‘There's no doubt Saddam Hussein was a very brutal dictator but what it did was liberate a whole load of other forces and we're seeing that play through today.’
