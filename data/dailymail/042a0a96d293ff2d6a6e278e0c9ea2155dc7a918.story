Germany's World Cup squad found a novel way to prepare for their final group game against the USA, by training with a rugby ball.

Premier League stars Andre Schurrle and Lukas Podolski were at the heart of the action, while Arsenal's Mesut Ozil seemed less comfortable with the oval-shaped ball.Â 

The squad looked relaxed and they threw and kicked the rugby ball around, with coach Joachim Low showing off his skills and Podolski practicing his volleying tecnique.

Give it a try: Andre Schurrle seemed to enjoy the unorthodox training methods in Santo Andre

Eye on the ball: Lukas Podolski demonstrated that he can strike a ball with his left foot, whatever the shape

Straight through: Mesut Ozil didn't show quite the same ability with the rugby ball as he does with a round ball

Germany need just a point against the USA on Thursday to ensure that they top Group G, and even a defeat would leave them likely to progress, barring a huge swing in goal difference.

International teams preparing by playing other sports is not an entirely new phenomenon - Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath famously injured his ankle playing touch rugby before a Test Match in 2005.

Luckily for Low and his squad however, the team seemed to come through without any mishaps, and will be keen to seal their last-16 place on Thursday.

Sun's out, guns out: Podolski and Julian Draxler show off their muscles during a relaxed session

Skills: Coach Joachim Low juggles a rugby ball as the German squad enjoy their session

Elbows: Cristoph Kramer takes an elbow in the face from Kevin Grosskreutz as they compete for the ball

On their way: Germany need only a point to progress after beating Portugal and drawing with Ghana
