This couple never let their love life get in the way of their work - even when they perform their knife throwing double act.

Sean MacPherson and Dumitrita  Tudorache, nicknamed Doyna, put their relationship on the line every day during their high risk circus act with the Circus of Horrors.

The pair, who live in London, have been together for six years and doing their hair-raising routine for the last three years.

And the loved-up circus performers insist it only gives their love life a thrill.

While trusting Dumitrita stands motionless, or strapped to a revolving board, Sean takes her life in his hands by throwing sharp blades at her at top speed.

Sean, 53, was born into a circus family and has been performing life threatening tricks in the ring since he was just 17 years old.

It was while Sean was working for the Chinese State Circus in 2008 that he met his long-term girlfriend Dumitrita, who had travelled to England to work as a dancer in the show.

But they didn't take up the terrifying feat until Sean - who by then had retired from circus acts - was approached by a close friend who runs the famous Circus of Horrors in 2011. 

Sean, a father-of-three, said: 'I think it works out better that we are in a relationship, there is a lot of trust between the two of us.

Doyna was originally a dancer while Sean has been working in circuses since the age of 17 

'We make a great partnership - when you do knife throwing you have to go on stage feeling confident and focused.

'But when we go on stage we both have to focus completely and forget anything that we have going on outside of work.

'I know that she trusts me and I have been doing this act for such a long time that I don't worry that I might miss and hit her. 

'When I was approached to go back to the circus, I said I would only do knife throwing again if Doyna was my target girl.

'We both enjoy the adrenaline rush.' 

The pair say that being a couple is beneficial to their act and that they enjoy the adrenaline rush it gives 

Doyna, 28, originally from Romania, said: 'When Sean first asked me to do this act with him it didn't take much convincing.

'But that's probably because he didn't really give me much choice.

'We have been doing it for three years now and it definitely keeps our relationship interesting.

'At the start of our relationship we used to argue before we went out on stage, and I used to worry about having him throw knives at me.

'But I have never really worried about him hitting me with the knives, I have a lot of trust in him and he has been doing this act for a very long time.

'He has told me before that he is more careful doing the act with me than he has been in the past.

'But I don't whether that's because he is getting older, or because he loves me more.'
