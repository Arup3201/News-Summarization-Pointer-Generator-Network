Yet another woman has stepped forward to accuse Bill Cosby of drugging her when she a young aspiring model.

The woman, who identified herself only as Lisa, told Dr Phil in an exclusive interview that she was just 21 in 1988 when the comedian told her modeling agency that he wanted to meet her.

'I was very excited to go and see him,' Lisa told Dr. Phil, in an interview that will air in full on Friday. 'I was starstruck. I felt invincible. I couldn't believe that he wanted to see me.'

When she met with him for the first time, 'he was a gentlemen and he was respectful and kind,' she said. 'He seemed very interested in me, and that made me feel very secure in seeing him again.'

Speaking out: Lisa, pictured, said she was just 21 when she was drugged by Bill Cosby in his hotel room

On another occasion, she took her sister and mother to meet him, and they were thrilled.

'My mother trusted Bill completely,' she said. 'I trusted him like I trusted my own father.'

Then one day, he called her out of the blue and said he wanted to see her at his hotel room to give her career advice, she said. She went to his suite alone.

While there, he said he wanted to see her acting skills and gave her some lines to read, she said.

She claimed that he offered her a small, brown drink, saying it would relax her before reading the lines. She initially refused, saying she didn't drink, but he insisted so she acquiesced.

'He made a second drink and had me drink the second drink as well,' she said. 'I noticed myself getting a little dizzy.'

Cosby sat on the edge of a couch and told her to sit down. He had his legs open and she sat between them with her back to his crotch, she said.

'He started to stroke my hair back in a petting motion,' she said. 'The last thing I remember is just feeling the strokes on my head. After that, I don't remember anything else.'

She said that she blacked out and woke up two days later in her own bed.

During her interview, Dr Phil asked if she knew if the comedian had sexually assaulted her.

'No,' she responded.

She said part of the problem in going to the police was that she did not know what had happened to her. But she wanted him to know that she knew he had done something wrong.

Lisa joins more than two dozen women who have claimed in recent weeks that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them in incidents stretching back to the 1960s and as recently as the 2000s. 

Dr Phil told her that Cosby's daughter, Evin, had released a statement.

'Rape is a serious allegation, and it is supposed to be taken very seriously, but so is falsely accusing someone,' it read. 'When someone rapes a person they go to prison. That should also happen the person that has wrongfully accused an innocent victim.' 

Lisa responded: 'No one remembers after they were drugged. Little bits and pieces of what has happened when they were drugged, they remember everything up until they were drugged, but they don’t remember after. 

Anger: Lisa, left, spoke to Dr Phil with other women who say they were drugged and raped by Bill Cosby, including Helen Hayes (right), who said to Cosby and his wife: 'Shame on you, shame on you!'

'So where's that time? All of us just blacked out miraculously, because we were around Bill Cosby from the shock of him being a star? I mean honestly.'

Although she had initially not wanted to speak out, she said she decided to come forward after model Janice Dickinson accused Cosby of raping her.

On the show, Lisa was joined by six other accusers who have already spoken out against the comedian: Kristina Ruehli, PJ Masten, Victoria Valentino, Helen Hayes, Beth Ferrier and Chelan.

'A body knows when it’s raped,' Masten said on the show. 'You not only rape physically but you are raped emotionally. and your spirit is gone forever. And he is a serial rapist. We all have that same thing in common. We all feel that.'

Hayes added: 'Hopefully it'll dissipate and I don't have to carry the shame anymore.'

She also had a message for Bill and his wife, Camille Cosby, who has stood by her husband and slammed the media coverage of 'rumors' about her husband. 

'Shame on you shame, shame on you, shame on you,' Hayes said. 

Standing by her man: Camille Cosby, pictured with her husband in November, broke her silence this week to slam the media's coverage of the accusations, suggesting it was Cosby who was the real victim

The show will air on Friday, and they will be joined by attorney Gloria Allred and Kathleen Phelps, a former Playboy bunny who maintains he is a respectful man and friend.

Cosby  has denied any wrongdoing and no criminal charges have ever been brought - but in 2006, he did settle a civil lawsuit with a woman who claimed he drugged and raped her in 2004.

Earlier this week, Camille Cosby broke her silence. She compared the media's handling of the reports to Rolling Stone's botched coverage of the UVA rape scandal.

'There appears to be no vetting of my husband's accusers before stories are published or aired,' she said. 'An accusation is published, and immediately goes viral... None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim. But the question should be asked - who is the victim?'
