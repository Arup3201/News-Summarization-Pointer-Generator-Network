A message in a bottle sent out to sea by a schoolgirl holidaying in Cornwall has washed up in Norway nearly 20 years later.

Lucy Elliot, now 31, was just 12-years-old when she wrote the note in 1994 but she never expected to get a reply.

Incredibly, the hand-written message was found recently by Kurt Johnny Haaland and his wife hundreds of miles away across the North Sea in Scandinavia.

Stunned: Lucy Elliot, now 31, was amazed that a message in a bottle she wrote and threw out to sea while on holiday in Looe, Cornwall (a holiday photo pictured in her hand) in 1994 was found in Norway recently

Treasure not trash: Incredibly, Kurt Johnny Haaland found the message in a bottle (pictured) while walking along the coast in Norway and prised the bottle open to reveal the faded letter

Mr Haaland was amazed when he prised the message out of the plastic bottle and found it had been written by a girl named Lucy Elliot, who wrote that she lived in Tile Hill, Coventry and had ‘brown thick wavy hair’.

He said: ‘My wife and I went for a walk a few weeks ago. We live on the south-west coast of Norway and like to go for walks along the coast.

Message in a bottle: Mr Haaland deciphered the faded letter written on magazine paper and was keen to get in touch with the author after making this amazing discovery

‘This day we went right out to the ocean
to enjoy the day. Between some rocks we saw a bottle with something in 
it. It was a bottle mail.

Dear friend. My name is Lucy Elliot and I am 12 years old.

I was born 1982 and I have brown thick wavy hair. Please write to me if you receive this letter.

I live in England, Coventry. I threw this letter out to sea from [unreadable]. The date today is the 19th September 1994.

My address is: Ferrers Close, Tile Hill North, Coventry. I have 2 cats, 1 brother.

Please write back. From a bored 12 year old girl.

‘It turned out that it contained a letter written by a girl from Coventry in 1994. 

‘Some words were difficult to decipher after having been so long out in all kind of weather.

‘We would be keen to write back to her.’

Ms Elliot, who now has two children of her own, was stunned by the discovery.

The full-time mother living in Woodford Halse, Northamptonshire, said: ‘I can remember writing the letter like it was yesterday.

‘I had lost my bracelet and was pacing up and down the beach trying to find it.

‘I got bored eventually so decided to write this message in a bottle and threw it into the sea.

‘When
I heard it had been found all the memories of that holiday came 
flooding back, it really makes you reflect on the past 20 years.

‘A
lot has changed since then, I’ve moved to a village in Northamptonshire
which is a far cry from a flat in Coventry but I still have the wavy 
brown hair.

From far, far away: This is the section of beach in Norway where the bottle was found, hundreds of miles across the North Sea from Cornwall

Now and then: Lucy Elliot on holiday in Looe, Cornwall in 1994 (left) never expected a reply to her letter to 'dear friend' and was stunned when she found out it was found on the Norwegian coast (right)

'Please write to me': Ms Elliot wrote that she had '2 cats, 1 brother' (pictured are her cats Smokey and Mini) and asked for a reply

'I have brown thick wavy hair': Ms Elliot said much has changed since she wrote the letter, except her hair is still wavy

‘I’ve often joked with friends about 
getting a reply but this is amazing - I never expected to hear anything 
back. It’s incredible.'

Ms 
Elliot, who lives with partner and CGI animator Andrew Gough, 42, and 
their daughter Eden, 13, and son Archie, eight, now plan to return to 
Looe where she will encourage her children to make their own message in a
bottle.

She said: ‘I would love to go back to Looe with my kids and they can do what I did. 

‘Who knows, in 20 years’ time someone might find their messages and contact them.’

The faded letter - written on branded teen magazine J17 paper with a flower on it - read: ‘Dear friend. My name is Lucy Elliot and I am 12 years old.

‘I was born 1982 and I have brown thick wavy hair. Please write to me if you receive this letter.

‘I live in England, Coventry. I threw this letter out to sea from [unreadable]. The date today is the 19th September 1994.

‘My address is: Ferrers Close, Tile Hill North, Coventry. I have 2 cats, 1 brother.

‘Please write back. From a bored 12 year old girl.’
