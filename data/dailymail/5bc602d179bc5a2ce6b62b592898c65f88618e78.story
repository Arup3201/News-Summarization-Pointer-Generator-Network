Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann has revealed he rejected a move to Arsenal as he wanted to work under Diego Simeone.

Griezmann attracted interest from Atletico Madrid, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain during the summer but decided to seal a move to the Spanish capital.

The 23-year-old France international has confirmed Arsene Wenger tried to entice him to the Emirates Stadium but felt Simeone would help his progression.

Managerial honours compared:

Arsene Wenger (at Arsenal) - Three Premier League titles, five FA Cups, five Community Shields - 13

Diego Simeone (at Atletico Madrid) - One La Liga title, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Cup, one Europa League, one UEFA Super Cup - 5

Griezmann, speaking to France Football, said: 'Was it weird when PSG and Arsenal were also interested? [Atletico are] still the champions of Spain!

'Why Spain and not elsewhere? This is my championship, my home. I'm happy here and Atletico is a great club. 

'The [champions] were willing to pay €30million [£23.8m] for me.

'I had the boss on the phone. He motivated me and said the club really wanted me. I knew that I was coming here to learn.

'I needed a club like that and a coach like Diego Simeone to progress. I always demand intensity in training. That's my style and I like it.'
