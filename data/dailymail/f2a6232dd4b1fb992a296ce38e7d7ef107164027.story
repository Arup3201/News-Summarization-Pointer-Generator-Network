Jose Mourinho took to Greece in a bid to enjoy some downtime with his family ahead of what will prove to be yet another intensely-fought Premier League campaign.

The Chelsea manager will have his squad back with him in Cobham over the next few weeks for pre-season training.

But for now the Portuguese is on the island of Mykonos with son Jose Mario and daughter Matilde.

Captain of his ship: Jose Mourinho is currently on the Greek island of Mykonos with his family

Back seat driver? The Chelsea manager hopped on a jet ski as his family enjoyed water sports on Monday

Family trip: Mourinho was with his two children as they hit the water equipped with life jackets

Need a helping hand, Jose? The Portuguese boss appeared to struggle to get on to the jet ski initially

Cruise control: Matilde Mourinho looked altogether more comfortable than her dad on the jet ski

The group were pictured tasting the delights of the tourist spot's water sports, with Mourinho wasting no time in jumping on a jet ski.

He'll be hoping that the Blues get off to a similarly fast start when the new term begins in August.

On paper they have a comfortably start, travelling to newly-promoted Burnley then hosting Leicester City sevens days later before a clash with Everton at Goodison Park.
