Nikki Allan, from Sunderland, who was brutally stabbed and beaten to death in 1992. Over 20 years later Northumbria Police are in talks with the BBC's Crimewatch with a view to filming a reconstruction of Nikki's final hours

A Crimewatch appeal could help finally snare the savage killer of a little girl who was stabbed and beaten to death more than 20 years ago.

Schoolgirl Nikki Allan was just seven years old when she was brutally murdered just yards from her home in Sunderland.

She was stabbed 37 times and her head was beaten with a brick before her body was dumped in a derelict warehouse.

No one was ever convicted of the 1992 killing and Nikki's brutal murder remains unsolved to this day.

But now Northumbria Police are in talks with the BBC's Crimewatch with a view to filming a reconstruction of Nikki's final hours.

The schoolgirl's mother Sharon Henderson, 48, is hoping a fresh appeal could finally bring an end to her two decades of heartache.

Ms Henderson, of Ryhope, Sunderland, is reported to have said: 'I want to see the killer behind bars.

'The police won't tell me if they have something new but a Crimewatch reconstruction could help me get justice.

'I have never given up hope that justice will be done. I have fought for so long and I know Nikki would be proud of me.'

Ms Henderson, who has three other daughters now in their 20s, added: 'I only hope something comes from a reconstruction.'

George Heron, then 24, of Wear Garth, Hendon, Sunderland, was Sharon's neighbour at the time of the killing and was charged with Nikki's murder.

However, a confession he made to police was ruled inadmissible as evidence by a judge at the trial and Heron was cleared of the charge.

He was subsequently ordered to pay Â£7,000 in damages, money he still owes, after Ms Henderson successfully sued him through the civil courts in 1994 for the battery that led to Nikki's death.

Sharon Henderson, the mother of Nikki Allan, hopes the Crimewatch reconstruction will bring her daughter's killer to justice. She said: 'I have never given up hope that justice will be done. I have fought for so long and I know Nikki would be proud of me'

A Northumbria Police spokesperson said: 'Unsolved murders are never closed and are regularly reviewed.

'We constantly consider whether advances in forensic techniques open up new avenues of investigation that were not available at the time of the original investigation and we are in the process of doing that in this case.

'We can confirm we've had an initial meeting with Crimewatch. Discussions are in their very early stages and no firm plans have been made.'

Crimewatch presenters Matthew Amroliwala, Kirsty Young and Martin Bayfield. Northumbria Police said they have met with producers, although nothing has been confirmed yet
