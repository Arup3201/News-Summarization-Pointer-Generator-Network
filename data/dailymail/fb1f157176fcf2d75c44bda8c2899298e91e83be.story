Two brothers were saved from their fishing boat on Sunday after they spent three hours precariously dangling off the edge of a dam.

Greg and Gary Cherry, of Tennessee, were out fishing for bass and perch in the icy Barren Fork River in McMinnville when their motor stopped working.

They were dragged to the edge of the Barren Fork River Dam where they were left stranded above the 12-foot drop.

Stuck: Greg and Gary Cherry were left stranded over the Barron Fork dam for three hours on Sunday after the motor on their boat failed

‘We locked our arms and I said, ‘We're in this together,’’ Greg Cherry, 47, told ABCNews. ‘I said, 'I love you,' and [Gary] said, 'I love you, too.' And if one of us goes over, we're going over together.’

‘We were both scared, but we prayed to God and God just watched over us,’ Gary Cherry added.  ‘If we didn't have our life jackets on and went over, we'd probably be done.’

The brothers moved to the rear of the boat to prevent it tipping over the edge

Fire-fighters were called by a passer-by three hours into the brothers ordeal.

They tied the boat to a nearby overpass and took the brothers away by rescue boat.

As soon as the rope was cut the 33-year-old boat plunged over the edge.

The brothers retrieved it today and plan to restore it so they can go out fishing again.

‘Fishing for me and my brother is a way of life,’ Greg Cherry said.
