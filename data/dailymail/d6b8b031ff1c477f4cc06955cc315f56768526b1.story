Family man: Charles Davis, 41, who had served 15 years in prison for a murder, shot dead his estranged wife and her 20-year-old son before turning the gun on himself

A Florida woman and her 20-year-old son have been gunned down by the mother's third husband, who then turned the gun on himself after sparing the life of his teenage stepdaughter.

Police in northwest Miami-Dade believe that 41-year-old Charles Davis opened fire on 44-year-old Valerie Davis and her son, Jeffrey Eskridge Jr, at around 3am Tuesday inside their home on 55th Court Street.

When officers arrived on the scene, they forced their way inside the residence and discovered the bodies of the parents and the son.

Jeffrey Eskridge Sr, the biological father of the 20-year-old victim, told the station WSVN that just before 3.30am he got a frantic call from his 16-year-old daughter, Tyria Poole, telling him that her stepfather had shot dead her family before ending his own life in front of her.

Tyria was at home as the bloody tragedy played out and hid in the closet. Charles Davis eventually found her, but according to her father, he told the teenage girl that he loved her too much to kill her.

Behind closed doors: Charles and Valerie Davis split up last week after eight years of marriage, prompting the husband to move out of their home in northwest Miami-Dade

Lone survivor: Tyria Poole, 16, was hiding in a closet when her stepfather shot her mother, brother, and then himself

Mr Eskridge
 said that he learned from his daughter that it all started when Charles
 and Valerie got into a heated argument in the middle of the night. 

Mrs Davis' son, Jeffrey, intervened trying to defend his mother, prompting his stepfather to shoot him.

Valerie Davis tried to run away and was also shot by her husband of eight years, according to Jeffrey Eskridge Sr.

Silver lining: Jeffrey Eskridge Sr said he was proud of his son for trying to protect his mother

The man said he had always known Charles Davis, his ex-wife's third husband, as a pleasant, hardworking family man.

But
 the 41-year-old husband and father had a dark past, which included 
lengthy prison sentences for second-degree murder, robbery with a deadly
 weapon and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. He was released in 
2006 after spending a total of 15 years behind bars.

A
 week before the double murder-suicide, Valerie and Charles Davis had 
separated, and the husband moved out of their home. He returned this 
week after convincing the mother of two to have dinner with him.

Mr Eskridge said as recently as Monday, he spoke on the phone with his son, who made no mention to him of any problems in their household.

‘I don't know if he snapped or something went wrong,’ he said.

The suspected gunman's relatives believe that Mr Davis was upset about his broken marriage

A grieving Mr Eskridge added that it is a small consolation for him knowing that in his last moments, his son tried to protect his mother.

‘He died doing exactly what I would have done and that is protecting his mother. I am proud of him. He went with his Mom, which he probably wanted to do,’ he told CBS Miami.
