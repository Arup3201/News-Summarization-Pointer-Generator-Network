England kicked off their crucial World Cup match against Uruguay tonight after a group of innocent fans drinking at a bar in Sao Paulo were attack by a hooded mob of thugs who threw Molotov cocktails, bottles and fireworks.

As the louts – many of them dressed in black - ripped up England flags outside the bar police were called and swooped on the gang who immediately tried to flee the area before being rounded up.

They still being held in a Sao Paulo district police station. Photographs later emerged of some of the Brazilian gang members being rounded up and detained by officers.

When police searched both their pockets and backpacks they found a number to be were carrying an array of weapons – including knives, brass 'knuckle dusters', rockets, boxing mouth guards and a quantity of drugs.

Eyewitnesses told how the gang first descended on the bar throwing Molotov cocktails and fireworks and one man said: 'One minute everything was peaceful and then this screaming mob came steaming down the street and targeted the bar.

None of the English fans had done anything to deserve being picked on.

'We do get some hooligan problems in 
Brazil and these young guys just wanted to make a statement. It was all 
over in about five minutes. The guys being attacked tried to run back 
into the bar and close the door.'

The incident happened a few hours before England's crucial World Cup Group D clash against Uruguay in Sao Paulo.

Further
 reports told before arriving at the bar the Brazilian gang caused 
damage to a series of shops and a bus in the area as they tried to 
escape from chasing police officers.

A
 spokesman for British police in Brazil to protect and help England 
supporters said: 'We are aware of an incident affecting fans around the 
area of the Fans Festival in Sao Paulo. We are working with the local 
authorities to establish the facts.'

Meanwhile, thousands of England fans have descended on the city to watch the crucial 'Three Lions' match and had a peaceful reception.

The
 Group D game is set to be a 'do or die' game for both sides after both 
England and Uruguay were lost their first tournament fixture last week.

Defeat
 for either side would mean certain elimination from the last 16 stage 
of the 2014 World Cup so the game left little margin for error.

England fans arriving in Sao Paulo 
were greeted by weather they would associate at home in winter – with 
overcast skies and persistent drizzle – before they faced a lengthy 
train or bus ride to the Corinthians Arena situated around 15 miles 
outside the city.

Steve 
Peters, a 35-year-old heating engineer from St Albans, Hertfordshire, 
was travelling with three friends and saw England's opening match defeat
 in Manaus but was upbeat about the chances for Roy Hodgson's side.

He
 explained: 'I think the team are at their best when they know what they
 have to do. The Italy game was a disappointment and we should have had a
 draw with the number of efforts we had on target.

'But I am backing us to beat Uruguay because they did not look that good in their opening game. I will go for 2-1 England.'

Many England fans arrived at the 66,000 capacity ground more than three hours before the kick-off to attach a variety of St George flags and banners to walls and terracing inside the stadium.

The match is expected to draw a TV audience of some 20 million at home and black market tickets for the game were being offered at more than £800.

With Uruguay a near neighbour of Brazil more than 25,000 Uruguayans were expected to be inside the stadium for the 4pm ( 8pm GMT) kick-off and police from both countries were keeping a watching brief on supporters gathering in the city's fan zone and outside the ground prior to kick off.

There had been concerns that rival fans might clash after the game if the result was a 'disaster' for either team – effectively ending their World Cup dreams and making their final group games next week meaningless in terms of qualification.

On the field England were preparing to select Wayne Rooney after a lacklustre display against Italy – while Uruguay's dangerous striker Liverpool's Luis Suarez was set to return to his national team after a knee operation last month.

Manager Roy Hodgson has supported Rooney – who has scored 39 goals for his country – and was expected to return him to a his favoured central striking role.

England went into the game aware that they have never won against Uruguay in World Cup competition – losing 4-2 in 1954 and drawing 0-0 in 1966 when they went on to lift the trophy.

On the eve of the game the Uruguay manager Oscar Tabarez said he was 'convinced'  Suarez would play some part in the match.
