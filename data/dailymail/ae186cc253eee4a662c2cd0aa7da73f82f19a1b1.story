Two brothers ordered a man to strip naked and cover himself in cooking oil before branding him with two red hot irons during a five day attack. 

Darius and Dainus Svedskas and a third man,  Sarkis Muradjan, held the 22-year-old victim captive at a house in Nelson, Lancashire, and whipped him with a belt and electric flex.

Darius Svedskas, 34, and Dainus, 24, have been jailed for four years and four months and four years and five months respectively at Preston Crown Court and Muradjan was sentenced to three years.

The court heard the victim suffered permanent scald marks from being burnt with both a 
travel and soldering iron after he was taken captive and battered for 
pleasure by the two brothers he had previously regarded as friends.

During his ordeal, the unnamed Lithuanian victim was ordered to walk on all fours around the house and was beaten about the head with a wooden chair causing serious head injuries.

The victim's younger brother, 17, was also held captive by the group but managed to smash his way through a ground floor double glazed window and raise the alarm at a nearby factory.

Both victims, who came to the UK to study and work, have returned to Lithuania.

Sarkis Muradjan was also jailed for three years for his part in the attack

Darius Svedskas pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, false imprisonment and assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst Dainus Svedskas admitted false imprisonment and causing actual bodily harm.

Muradjan, 32, also of Nelson, admitted false imprisonment and causing actual bodily harm.

The attack happened in May after the victim was befriended by the three men, Lancashire Police said.

His younger brother arrived in the UK to study on May 26 and was unaware of his brother's suffering until he too was held captive and brutally beaten.

The teenager was subjected to several assaults over a two day period on May 28 and 29 where he was slapped and punched several times.

Lancashire Police said the iron attack occurred whilst the older victim was cowering in a bathroom.

He was ordered to strip naked, cover himself in cooking oil before being burned with a travel iron and soldering iron, and also whipped with the buckle end of a belt.

The victim was then summoned downstairs where the assault continued and he was hit with electric cable and ordered to walk around on all fours.

The ordeal only stopped when the 17-year-old, who feared for his brother's life, managed to escape by jumping through the thick plate glass window causing cuts to his face and body.

Police said the two victims suffered 'physical and psychological abuse.'

Following sentencing, Det Sgt Phil Pilkington from Lancashire Police said:  'I am pleased with the sentences handed down to Darius and Dainus Svedskas, along with Sarkis Muradjan, that reflect the seriousness of the violent assaults they carried out, along with keeping two innocent men against their will.

'The two victims were in the country to study and work and have been left terrified by their ordeal, especially the 22 year old who was the main subject of violence, threats and intimidation.

During the five day ordeal, the Svedskas brothers forced the victim to strip naked and cover himself in cooking oil before they branded him with hot irons

'The assaults that were inflicted on him were particularly degrading and prolonged and I praise the 17-year-old who showed bravery in escaping the situation to call for help for his brother.

'The brothers have now returned to their home country of Lithuania but have been left with permanent, visible scars that will be permanent reminders of their horrendous ordeals.

'I hope that the sentencing has given them sort of closure so that they can move on with their lives.

'Let these results serve as a warning to those who think it's acceptable to use violence against others - we will not tolerate it and you will be brought before the courts and punished.'
