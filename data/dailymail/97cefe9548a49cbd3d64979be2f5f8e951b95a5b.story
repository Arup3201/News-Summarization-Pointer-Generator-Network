Jilted: Steve Froggatt, 58, told police he 'necked' the bird after letting himself in using a spare key

A jilted lover threw eggs at his former girlfriend’s house before tearing the head off her pet parrot in revenge for dumping him, a court has heard.

Steve Froggatt, 58, of Preston, Lancashire, who targeted Pauline Woodfine’s house after the pair had separated, told police he ‘necked’ the bird after letting himself in using a spare key.

Miss Woodfine, who has recently been treated for cancer, returned home from a night out to find African Grey parrot Deano’s cage empty and his feathers all over the floor.

When she confronted Froggatt with a text saying: ‘Why have you killed my bird?’, she claims he simply replied: ‘You killed me.’

Froggatt reportedly admitted pulling the head off the parrot to police because it was ‘annoying’, but Deano’s body has never been found.

Froggatt had let himself into the property by using a spare key he had been given so he could collect his possessions after the woman, a retired nurse, called time on the relationship.

Police had been called to domestic incidents at the couple’s home several times but no charges were pressed.

Former brewery worker Froggatt has pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal damage relating to Deano and damaging brickwork at her home.

He was remanded in custody and is next due to appear at Preston Magistrates’ Court on October 7.
