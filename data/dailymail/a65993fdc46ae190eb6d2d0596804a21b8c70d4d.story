A South African mine where 34 striking workers were shot dead by police resumed operations today - despite only a third of its employees reporting for duty.

Thousands of workers stayed away from the Marikana platinum mine, north-west of Johannesburg, defying a warning that they would be sacked if they failed to turn up.

The ultimatum was issued by the mine's owner, London-listed company Lonmin, after some 3,000 employees walked out in a dispute over pay.

Relations between the company remain tense after last week's violence, which left at least 78 people injured and led to some 250 arrests.

Protest: Striking miners gather outside Marikana platinum mine. Only a third of the workforce returned to work despite an ultimatum threatening employees with the sack if they failed to turn up

Lonmin, the world's third-largest platinum producer, originally demanded that the workers go back to work last Friday, but it later delayed the deadline to today.

Today the company announced it had moved the deadline again, by a further 24 hours, 'in light of current circumstances'.

Some
miners had said the ultimatum was an insult to their dead colleagues, 
who were killed when police with automatic weapons opened fire during a 
demonstration last Thursday.

'Lonmin
can confirm that work at its Marikana operations resumed today as 
significant numbers of employees returned to work,' the company said in a
statement.

Determined: Striking workers said an ultimatum demanding their return to work was disrespectful to employees who were killed during violence last week

'The company 
can also announce that those illegal strikers who did not return to work
this morning will not be dismissed and have been allowed an extra day 
in light of current circumstances.'

It was unclear how many of the staff who arrived for work today had been on strike.

Stand-off: The mine's owner decided to extend its ultimatum for a second time after two-thirds of the workforce refused to return to their duties

Lonmin
spokesman Sue Vey told the BBC that those employees who had arrived 
were doing maintenance work to ensure areas of the site were safe for 
mining.

About 3,000 rock-drill operators (RDOs) at the mine walked out more than a week ago, demanding higher pay.

In
its earlier statement, Lonmin had warned that workers could be fired if they failed to attend work today.

It said: 'The final ultimatum provides RDOs 
with a last opportunity to return to work or face possible dismissal.

'Employees could therefore be dismissed if they fail to heed the final ultimatum.'

The
statement also advised 25,000 non-striking workers and 10,000 
contractors, who have been unable to work because of the violence, that 
police believed the site was safe enough for them to return.

Lonmin's
chief financial officer, Simon Scott, said: 'The safety and security of
our employees is paramount and nobody will be asked to report for duty 
if the police consider them in danger of reprisals.

'The
vast majority of our workforce, and their families, who rely on our 
mine for their livelihood, have now been unable to work for more than a 
week.'

Some workers, including Zachariah Mbewu, said the ultimatum was disrespectful.

'Expecting us to go back is like an insult,' Mr Mbewu said. 'Many of our friends and colleagues are dead, then they expect us to resume work. Never.'

Killings: Police surround the bodies of striking miners after opening fire on a crowd at the Marikana platinum mine. Only about a third of staff have returned to work despite an ultimatum threatening those on strike with the sack

Anger: Thirty-four miners were killed and at least 78 people were injured during last week's violence

Violence: Police claimed they opened fire to protect themselves when miners armed with spears and machetes charged towards them

Demonstration: About 3,000 workers walked out of the mine more than a week ago, demanding more pay

South African president Jacob Zuma declared a week of national mourning after the tragedy.

Shocking video footage of the incident showed police firing automatic weapons and handguns into a crowd of strikers for about a minute.

Police chief Mangwashi Victoria Phiyega defended her officers' actions afterwards, claiming they had to protect themselves when miners armed with spears and machetes charged towards them.

Phiyega said the strikers had not dispersed earlier, despite police use of water cannon and stun grenades.

The shooting is one of the worst involving police in South Africa since apartheid.
