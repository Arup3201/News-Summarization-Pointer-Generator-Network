An Australian father and son have been rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard after getting stranded in their yacht in a dangerous snowstorm off the coast of Massachusetts.

Reg McGlashan, 66, and his son Jason, 37,  got into trouble in stormy seas about 240km south of Nantucket, Massachusetts, on Sunday morning.

Jason had reportedly purchased the vessel, the Sedona, on online auction site eBay, and the pair were planning to sail 16,000 kilometres to the NSW coastal town of Port Macquarie - their hometown.

In an interview with local U.S. paper The Newport Daily News one week before they set sail, the pair said they were aware of the risks of their journey but thought they were well-prepared.

'We've never done anything like this. Dad's not even a sailor, but he's a quick study,' Jason McGlashan said.

'We've got plenty of food, plenty of booze, good sails and all the safety gear you could ever need, so we're going to be OK.'

The pair set off on Friday despite the Coast Guard issuing warnings about severe blizzard conditions.

Less than two days into their journey Jason McGlashan was forced to the call Coast Guard after their vessel lost power and its sails were torn in the storm.

'He requested he and his father be removed from the vessel due to the degrading weather,' the Coast Guard said in a statement.

The rescue crews battled near hurricane-force winds, 7.6 metre waves and ice to meet the two men in the six degree water.

A Coast Guard rescue swimmer helped them into a metal rescue basket before they were hoisted to safety.

'Given the severity of this storm, this rescue was a major effort and we are all relieved it ended as it did,' said Lt. j.g. Tyler Dewechter, MH-60 pilot and public affairs officer at Air Station Cape Cod. 

'We are glad we were prepared for this storm and could render aid - and also continue to urge mariners to stay safe and heed the cautions and advisories of winter storm warnings.' 

They were checked for cold weather injuries but none were found.
