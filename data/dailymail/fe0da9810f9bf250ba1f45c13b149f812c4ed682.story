Jose Mourinho has a point when he 
says Arsene Wenger is a specialist in failure. It is all Wenger has 
known since 2005 – no other top club in Europe would accept this state 
of affairs. Whether you love Wenger or not, whether you buy the excuse 
about the stadium or not, Arsenal have been without a trophy for too 
long. It really is that simple.

The
 pomposity of the Wenger supporters out there among the press and in 
football has been cringeworthy. They’ve wasted no time accusing Mourinho
 of lacking class. Was what Jose said any more insulting than Wenger 
telling his own fans that fourth place is a trophy?

But
 did Mourinho need to say what he said? He could have made his point in a
 more subtle fashion, that’s for sure. That would probably have had more
 impact.

Struggles: Jose Mourinho made a point of pointing out Arsene Wenger's failings this week

The big ones: Arsenal must win either the Premier League or Champions League to appease supporters

Mistake, Jose? The Chelsea boss may look back and regret comments made about Wenger this week

But he bulldozed in, and I can’t help thinking Jose’s made three mistakes here:

1)
 He will look a fool if Arsenal win the Premier League or the Champions 
League this season. (Please don’t include the FA Cup as meaningful 
success for Arsenal. It’ll be a good day out for the fans, but that’s 
all. They’ve waited too long to settle for the trophy Wigan won last 
year.)

2)
 Mourinho’s response to being humiliated by Guardiola in Spain (when 
Real Madrid lost 5-0 at the Nou Camp) was to get very personal with his 
rival. In the short-term it worked, Guardiola was exhausted by it all 
and quit, Mourinho won a title, but ultimately left the job in disgrace 
and widely considered more a failure than a success. Getting personal 
didn’t work back then, and it may not work now.

3) Mourinho
 has once again made himself the only mouthpiece for Chelsea Football 
Club - the figurehead and the chief representative of the club. This 
power trip contributed massively to his downfall first time at Stamford 
Bridge. And his departure at Inter Milan. And his fallout with the 
hierarchy at Real Madrid. 

Mourinho had won a lot of admiration after Chelsea’s brilliant win at Manchester City in the Premier League. 

I
 don’t know why he decided to pick on Wenger. Mourinho’s trophy success 
stands up comfortably against Wenger’s, so maybe the Chelsea boss should
 pick on someone his own size.

They’re both in England for massive European games this week, but for me Bayern Munich are still in Barcelona’s shadow.

Sure you can throw last season’s semi-final at me, where with Lionel Messi unfit but playing in the first leg - unable to play in the second leg - the Germans totally swept Barca aside.

They’ve gone 46 games unbeaten in the Bundesliga – they’re a fantastic side.

Think again! Bayern Munich are still in Barcelona's shadow - despite winning the Champions League last year

But I’m talking about Barcelona at their peak, who won three Champions League finals in six years. The third success, at Wembley against Manchester United in 2011, had even Sir Alex Ferguson admitting he couldn’t compete with such a brilliant side.

Fergie had a tactical plan to exact revenge on Guardiola after the defeat in the final in 2009 in Rome - one he had his players practising for 10 days up to the final. But not even the great Sir Alex could match Guardiola. Wayne Rooney, Antonio Valencia and Michael Carrick were all singled out for criticism by Fergie, but in truth United were second best in all departments.

During their dominant era, Barcelona absolutely overwhelmed Real Madrid with a stunning display of beautiful passing and devastating finishing, not once but twice: there was the 6-2 win at the Bernabeu with Xavi’s right foot on fire, and with Messi and Thierry Henry totally dominating Juande Ramos’ side on their own patch; and then there was the 5-0 mauling at the Nou Camp, Mourinho’s first El Clasico, a beautiful team display of perfect football.

Habit: Barca have won Europe's premier competition three times in the last eight seasons - including 2011

Difficult: Sir Alex Ferguson admitted the Catalans were just too good for Manchester United at Wembley

Down and out: Barca were so good in their 5-0 win against Real in 2010 that Iker Casillas dumfounded

Easy! Mundo Deportivo carried this front page after a super Lionel Messi display

On virtually a weekly basis, Barcelona played some mesmerising football in La Liga and the Champions League. It was a joy to watch. They still hit those peaks now of course, but not as regularly. As Gerard Pique said this week, the fear factor around Barcelona has waned a little.

Barcelona’s era of dominance in Europe lasted for at least six years. Bayern Munich have been top dogs for only a year and a half so far. They have finally put Dortmund in their place, but needed to spend an absolute fortune to do it.

Champions League defeats in the past 12 months at home against Arsenal and Manchester City, both yet to be true winners in Europe, cost them very little in the bigger picture, but hint at a fragility undermining claims Munich are better than Barcelona.

Let’s pay due respect to what could turn out to be the best club side we’ll ever see in our lifetime. Barcelona deserve more respect than to be considered second best to this Bayern Munich outfit.

Have the Bavarians reached the levels over a sustained period of time that Barcelona achieved? Not in my opinion, not yet.

Pep’s Barca were the very best. Pep’s Bayern have a long way to go before comparisons can properly begin to be made.

Fulham are being laughed at across the country. Martin Jol, Rene Meulensteen, Ray Wilkins, Alan Curbishley and Felix Magath are all managers, and have all at some point this season been hired by the club.

If things aren’t going well, just keep appointing managers seems to be the logic.

In the meantime players are coming and going – indeed two players – Adel Taarabt and Dimitar Berbatov - were deemed surplus to requirements in January, yet while Fulham hurtled headfirst towards the bottom of the table, these players were picked up by Monaco and AC Milan. Both have already scored for their new clubs.

Potted: Fulham dispensed of Rene Meulensteen as manager after less than three months in charge

Incoming! Felix Magath has been brought in to try and arrest the slide to the Championship

It’s a club on the face of it blundering its way towards the Championship.

But there is another way of looking at events at Craven Cottage.

It takes a brave chairman to admit he got something wrong with such regularity. And if he’s prepared to face up to his own mistakes, and make a wise choice in rectifying the problem, he should be rewarded at the end of the season.

Sticking with the wrong manager can’t be a good idea. But change is only good if the right man is brought in.

Let’s see if Magath is better than the four other managers given various roles at Fulham this season.

Tactical masterclass: Darren Ferguson switched formations three times during the win at Swindon

On Monday night I took my son to Swindon to watch our club, Peterborough United, try to get to Wembley for the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy Final. 

We witnessed a tactical masterclass from Darren Ferguson – he changed formation three times in the second half, ending up virtually 3-6-1 to seal a draw on the night - and a show of nerve during the penalty shootout, ending in Posh booking their trip to Wembley.

It’s the stuff memories are made of – me and my boy will be talking about it for years. It’s the kind of night that makes a boy proud to support his club, while the other kids at his school in the Home Counties support Spurs, Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea.

Posh fans will have a great day out at the very least this season – and that means even though we support a small club, in a lower division, we will enjoy our season far more than the vast majority of supporters across the country.

The fans of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Norwich, West Brom, West Ham and others won’t have a day out at Wembley, or a comparable high this year. 

Big night! Adrian Durham and his son celebrate as Peterborough progress at the County Ground

Off to Wembley! Posh reached the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final after the penalty shootout win

Bleak: Peterborough are likely to enjoy more success than Manchester United this season

You see it doesn’t matter what division you’re in, or what competition you get to the final of. What matters is that the team you love give you great times.

And there is no doubt my team did that on Monday night.

Even Manchester United fans are unlikely to enjoy anything remotely close to the kind of excitement my son and I will have as we build up to the big day, and then head to Wembley itself for the game.

The Ferguson family still have something to shout about, despite Manchester United’s season from hell.
