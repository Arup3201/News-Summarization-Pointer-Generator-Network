Tragic: Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, passed away on Saturday just weeks after he posted a heartbreaking video on to YouTube wishing an inspirational farewell to the world

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Terminally-ill Australian Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, died yesterday just weeks after he posted a heart-breaking and inspirational farewell message to the world on YouTube.

Shaun, who was told by doctors he did not have long to live after his body rejected a second heart transplant, passed away holding his father’s hand reported the Sun Herald.

The teenager became an internet sensation after a glitch meant the tragic goodbye he was trying to post his tragic goodbye speech to his friends on Facebook was uploaded on YouTube as well. He woke up to find it had more than 10,000 views.

The video, in which he shows no signs of self pity - instead encouraging watchers to seize the day and make the most of their lives – had been viewed more than 1.9 million times on Sunday.

The boy’s devastated father said his son’s positivity never wavered and that Shaun had given him constant hugs in recent days.

‘He passed peacefully with me holding his hand; that is something the family will hold with us,’ he told the Sun Herald.

Shaun’s death came as a shock as his distraught family hoped he had weeks, or even months, to live.Tributes from around the world have started to pour in for the inspirational teen, including from his favourite football club.

In his three-minute long 'My Final Goodbye' clip, after choking back tears, Shaun says: 'I won't be here as long as I thought, but I want to say that it's been an awesome ride and I have no regrets.

'Live life to the fullest because you never know what's going to happen.'

The video has inspired such a wave of emotion in his homeland that Shaun spent his final weeks living out his dreams by appearing in Neighbours, meeting his favourite Aussie Rules football player, writing his memoirs - and even finding love.

Shaun's girlfriend is a fellow heart patient he started a relationship with just over a month ago but has been friends with for seven years.

'The hardest thing for me is leaving her, knowing that I won't get to marry her,' he told the Herald Sun in Australia.

'To have kids together. To grow old together. That is what makes me sad.

He added: ' I want to have fun. I want to enjoy my life. The way I look at it is I didn't get to decide this. These are the cards I have been dealt. I just have to roll with the punches.

'I have had two heart transplants and a stent put in. I have had ten more years than I should have because of that. I want to go out with a bang.'

His father Cameron admits the circumstances surrounding Shaun's death have left him bursting with pride at his boy's bravery - but utterly devastated he will have to bury his beloved son.

Cameron told the Herald Sun two weeks ago: 'I just pray that it's quick. I don't want him to suffer. No parent should have to bury their child. But he's just loving life and wants us to do the same. He doesn't want us to cry for him.

'I've become angry with the world, I question why this beautiful person should be taken way from me, from his family and from the world. But he doesn't want me to cry. He needs to know I'm going to be OK.'
