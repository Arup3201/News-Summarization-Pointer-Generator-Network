Many Americans may be dreaming of a white Christmas, but it's turning into a travel nightmare for those looking to get out of town for the holidays.

Meteorologists predict snowfall could
 blanket nearly half the nation on Tuesday - from as far west as the Rockies to Dallas and Maine - as a
 massive snowstorm moves from the Great Plains and up into the 
Northeast.

Over 100 flights have been canceled due to the weather and more than 4,000 others have been delayed.

And Jack Frost is expected to continue nipping at American noses until Saturday.

While children everywhere, both young and young-at-heart, are likely to welcome the snow, the nation's 87 million holiday travelers will likely be less enthusiastic.

The latest figures from FlightStats.com showed 146 flights across the nation were cancelled by 10.30pm Eastern Time on Monday.

The storm, which has been named Draco by The Weather Channel, is expected to dump about three inches of snow in and around Denver, Colorado, tonight before proceeding east.

The system will then gain 
steam as it heads along the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles in the late 
afternoon to early evening of Christmas Day.

From
 there, it will head up towards the Great Lakes and move eastward 
throughout Wednesday.

Once it reaches the East Coast, it will begin in 
the Washington, D.C. area before moving up toward the Northeast up to Maine.

The high winds could threaten to 
delay even more flights at airports in New York, Philadelphia and 
Washington, meteorologists said.

Pittsburgh is expected to take the 
biggest hit of any major metropolitan area, with 10 to 18 inches 
possible by Saturday evening.

Western New York, including Buffalo, 
is looking at 14 inches, said Pat Slattery, a spokesman for the 
National Weather Service.

Accuweather
 is now predicting that 'significant' snow will fall in states like 
Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas, potentially giving Oklahoma City its first
 Christmas snowfall 
since 1914.

Even Dallas, Texas, could see 
flurries for Christmas - though likely no accumulation.

The last time 
Dallas saw snowfall on Christmas Day was 1997 - though a 2009 blizzard 
left several inches behind on Christmas Eve.

Little Rock Arkansas could get up to three inches. That last time more than an inch fell on Christmas Day was 1926.

Western California and the Pacific Northwest are due for snow on Christmas Day as well.

But if Draco doesn't wreak enough havoc for Christmas, a storm thatÂ The Weather Channel has dubbed Euclid will be right behind it, taking a similar path over Colorado toward the East Coast.

On the southern edge of the storm 
system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the 
roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs 
in Alabama.

More tornadoes may sweep into the Gulf Coast on Christmas Day, from Texas to the Florida panhandle, according to Accuweather.

In some regions, the reaction to the winter weather was not necessarily a question of 'why?' but 'what took so long?'

Mayor Rob Ortt of North Tonawanda, New 
York, just north of Buffalo, said of judging the city's holiday lighting
 contest in the past week: 'There was something missing. I think this was the first year there was no snow, not even a dusting.'

'Everyone thinks of us as a place 
where snow is, and you relish it at Christmas time,' he said, adding, 
'When we have snow around St. Patrick's Day, that's when people get 
annoyed.'
