Over the past few months a block of apartments which were formerly public housing have become some of the most expensive real estate in town.

Six apartments in the inner-Sydney suburb of Millers Point have recently sold for more than a million dollars each, but proposed changes to the City of Sydney's heritage laws could see the new owners renovation plans dampened.

The changes mean that buyers could be banned from building additional storeys or adding rooms to the apartments, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Proposed changes to Sydney's heritage laws could hinder renovation or extension plans for the new owners of Millers Point apartments

This move could also see the sale prices for the remaining heritage-listed apartments plummet.

Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has been a critic of the plan to sell the 200 properties and relocate the public housing tenants, and has rallied to help the displaced people.

This week a proposal will go to a council committee with the aim of preventing any extensions or expansions to the apartments.

Currently the requirements of the Millers Point buildings state that they can be up to nine metres high and the apartments' floor space can be twice the side of the block of land. 

Some properties in the exclusive Sydney suburb went on sale earlier this year after the former public housing tenants were relocated

This means, according to a council report, expansions between 30 and 110 square metres - in the form of an extra bedroom or  

The report said any expansion 'will have a significant impact on … the integrity of the conservation area and heritage items". 

Some height and floor space increases may still be allowed under the proposal, but would need to adhere to specific conservation plans for each apartment. 

The City of Sydney was asked by the NSW Heritage Council to reconsider these controls, telling The Sydney Morning Herald that buys would: 'seek to maximise … development potential'.

New restrictions could prevent owners from expanding the buildings, for which a high price was paid due to the location of the apartments 

The proposal could also see the properties devalued by up to $350,000

Malcom Gunning, president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW said any alterations would cause sale prices to dive, and could see properties devalued by up to $350,000.

'[The proposal] will affect the price because, in their current form they are probably not worth the money [being] paid', he told the website. 

The eviction of the former tenants from the prime real estate properties has always been a contentious issue, but the government's justification was that money could be made to house them in other suburbs.  

Family and Community Services minister Gabrielle Upton said it wasn’t fair to the 58,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list for the government to spend hundreds of millions of dollars maintaining properties unsuitable for public housing.
