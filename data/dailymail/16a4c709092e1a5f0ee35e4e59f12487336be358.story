The owner of a truck stolen and written off by a nine-year-old boy two days before he evaded airport security to fly half-way across the country today hit out at the soft treatment he got from police.

Just 48 hours before the unnamed boy made national headlines for his audacious flight to Las Vegas after sneaking past three levels of security he stole a delivery truck belonging to a noodle company in Minneapolis.

The boy took the truck and then went on his own demolition derby up a windy uphill road near a farmer's market, and plowing into several cars including a police cruiser in downtown Minneapolis after a short chase with authorities.

The boy's father said they his son had thought he was playing video game 'Grand Theft Auto'.

Troubled youth: It has emerged that the boy stole this truck and crashed it after a short police chase

String of dramas: The truck incident happened just two days before the boy boarded the flight to Las Vegas

Troublesome: As well as stealing the car, the boy also has a history of playing truant and sneaking into a local water park without paying entry

Ultimately the car chase and crash caused $5,888 in damage, Edina police spokeswoman Kaylin Martin said.

But the treasurer of the noodle company whose delivery truck was totalled thinks if cops and prosecutors hadn’t treated him with kid gloves he wouldn’t have had the opportunity to skip town.

‘They can’t charge him,’ Mei Dang, treasurer of United Noodle Company told MailOnline. ‘If they didn’t release him maybe he wouldn’t be in Las Vegas.’

Dang, of United Wholesale in Minneapolis told MailOnline she's down a delivery truck and upset that the youth was freed.

'The police are doing nothing so what can we do? They released him and he's probably going to go out and damage more property.

Indeed, cops let the joyrider walk after he was cited for motor vehicle theft, damage to property, and reckless driving among others, records show.

It's unclear if the boy will face formal charges given his young age, officials said.

Dang recalled being shocked last Tuesday around lunchtime after learning that one of her delivery trucks had been taken from their lot as pallets were being unloaded.

Heartbreak: At a press conference this afternoon, the father, pictured, with a black hoodie and baseball cap pulled down over his face, said the family were 'heartbroken' when they learned what their son had done

'The keys were in the truck after making deliveries and my driver was bringing his invoices into the office and when he went back the truck was gone,’ she said.

Dang rang 911 and told the dispatcher that the 9-year-old was heading downtown.

'They caught him right away,' she said.

How the youngster managed to go unseen to joyride in the noodle truck remains a mystery.

'I have no clue, Dang said. 'He just walked in from the side.'

When cops nabbed the boy they initially thought he was a teenager.

'At first they think he was 14,' she said. 'But days later they put it together and realized he's really young. They said he was only nine and he's in Las Vegas.'

Father of boy, 9, who sneaked onto Las Vegas flight sobs as he describes how he begged for help with his troubled son but was told child 'hasn't done enough'

Today the boy’s father agreed with Dang. He claims he pleaded with cops about his soft-treatment after the truck theft.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the father, who mummified his face with black t-shirts to protect his identity and that of his son admitted that he’s ‘not perfect’.

But he claimed that his hands were tied by authorities who threatened to throw the book at him if he carried out threats to beat the boy.

‘I asked the [police]officer ‘Please sir, will you watch me whoop his butt?’

He claimed he was told he’d be thrown in jail if he struck his son. 

‘The officer told me “If we see you hit your son we're going to have to lock you up.”’

I said, ‘Sir, what can I do? I've been asking for help and no one's helping me.

‘I’m in what's called double jeopardy.  If I whoop my son I get locked up. If I let my son go on doing what he's doing I get in trouble.’

At one point the father choked up and said he was begging for help to turn his son’s life around.

‘Please help me. Please.’

The father said that his son's erratic behavior was escalating even as young as five-years-old, but denied claims that his boy was taking medication.

Even before he boarded the Delta flight to the national embarrassment of the TSA, there were plenty of tell-tale signs of the child’s troubled upbringing. 

In an email titled ‘private data’ dated from last December Janine Moore, who works for the county’s Human Services and Public Health Department, described the boy to fellow administrators as ‘challenging’, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

Moore added that there ‘was a pattern of behaviour’ and that the kid couldn’t be trusted. 

‘Typically, staff can tell if a child is lying, but with this child they are unsure what is going on. This is a two-parent home, and there is at least one other child.’

In her memo, Moore wrote that the boy's future could go two ways. If he's been mistreated, he could be removed from his home. If he has a mental health issue, there could be a 'behavioral health response,' which she didn't explain. 

The parents are raising three kids, including a 14-year-old daughter and an infant.

The boy’s prolonged absence was hardly an event at his spare, bungalow-styled home located on the southern edge of North Minneapolis.

His parents thought the child had taken out the garbage and went to play at a friend’s house.

In fact, the child had made it to Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport by himself, slipped through a security checkpoint and then boarded a Delta Air Lines flight before he was discovered by suspicious flight attendants. 

It was only after their son had already landed in Las Vegas and been taken into protective custody by police and child services there, did the parents called 911 and filed a missing person report.

The boy is believed to have left his entire family in the dark to his hi-altitude Houdini act.

Contrary to reports, his mother, who works for an airline, insists she did not help her son get on the flight. The boy's father works for a bus company.

Few family members have spoken to him and it’s unclear when or if he will be coming back home as he remains in custody of child services in Las Vegas.

Reached at her home on Tuesday the boy’s mother, who requested anonymity, told MailOnline she was floored along with the rest of the world when she learned her son had runaway out of town on an airplane.

‘I was just surprised in general that a child could do those things,’ she said. ‘Its crazy.’

The mother of three said her son is ‘smart’ but added that the family needs closure.

‘I feel bad but things happen in life and you move on.’

She also dumbfounded that her son’s charade has grabbed almost as many headlines as the federal government shutdown.

‘This is the second headline next to the shutdown in Washington D.C,’ she said.
