Charges: Jin Ackerman is accused of the murder of Antonino Isnit at a Las Vegas Walmart the morning after Christmas Day

A hold-up in a Las Vegas Walgreens ended in tragedy the morning after Christmas Day when the armed robber shot dead the store clerk when he realized he used to work with him.

Jin Ackerman, 25, fired on Antonino Isnit, 58, saying, 'Sorry Tony, but you know me' before he opened fire according to the police report.

Ackerman was apprehended and arrested by a SWAT team at his home on Friday and officers revealed that he knew Isnit from his time at the same store in 2011.

According to the police report, Ackerman entered the Walgreens at around 4am on Friday morning dressed in gray clothes, a black pea coat and a surgical mask.

He asked a female employee to help him find another surgical mask and then asked her to let him use the bathroom.

Suddenly, Ackerman forcibly shoved the woman into the bathroom with him when she opened it and emptied her pockets and handcuffed her.

The woman also told police that the 25-year-old suspect fixed a silencer to a pistol he produced.

However, the woman was paged by Isnit to the front desk when he wondered where she had got to and Ackerman realized she had to return.

He commanded her to 'act normal' according to the Las Vegas Review Journal and crytically told her not to cry and that the silencer was 'for Tony'.

The unidentified woman managed to convince Isnit to go on a break and then emptied the safe for Ackerman who took between $5,000 and $7,000.
