The BBC has been forced to defend spending thousands of pounds putting up staff in a luxury £279-a-night hotel while filming the popular countryside programme Lambing Live.

During filming for the third series, the entire 65-strong team set up camp in a lavish country house hotel which boasts a spa, two golf courses, a gym, swimming pool and tennis courts.

Production crew, including presenters Kate Humble and Adam Henson, stayed 21 miles away from the Scottish filming location at the plush Dalmahoy Country Club while the farmer and his staff tended their sheep around the clock at their farm.

Dalmahoy Country Club: The BBC has been forced to defend itself after putting up the 65-strong Lambing Live team set up camp at the lavish hotel

Last night critics accused the BBC of extravagance - questioning why they needed such a huge crew and why the production team had not been booked into cheaper B&B accommodation nearer to the site of filming.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The BBC has to get the best deal for licence fee payers when purchasing accommodation. The use of a luxury country club as the BBC’s accommodation of choice appears to be a lavish expense at licence fee payers’ expense.’

Alex Hogg, chairman of campaign group the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, said: ‘I don’t live far from where the latest Lambing Live was filmed for the BBC.

‘How many BBC employees were needed to run some cables round a lambing shed? A dozen maybe? Twenty max? Almost 70 people were used and they stayed in some very exclusive country club. It must be tough being the Beeb.’

Margaret Thain, of the nearby Meadows B&B, said: ‘I would have loved to have people staying at my B&B, but I am probably not as exclusive as the Dalmahoy.’

The BBC also decided not to stay at the closest hotel, the Peebles Hydro Hotel - despite a standard room costing almost £40 less than the Dalmahoy Country Club's standard rate.

Last night the BBC was forced to defend its spending on the programme and said .

A spokeswoman from BBC factual TV, said the Corporation paid a discounted fee for the rooms.

She said:
 ‘Around 65 crew in total required accommodation in Scotland throughout 
the week of Lambing Live, which is typical for a live broadcast over four nights.

‘The crew stayed at the Dalmahoy Marriott, paying £58 a night. This was the closest hotel to the filming location that was able to accommodate this number.

‘This was the most economically sensible choice as the hotel offered a competitive rate for a group booking, with a reduction of around 50% less than their standard rate. This was substantially less than other hotels in the area.

‘The BBC was also able to save on transport costs by having all crew staying at the same hotel, meaning they could be bussed directly to the farm each day.

‘This hotel was also chosen because it is situated on a main road, which is necessary in case of bad weather.’

The Lambing Live format has proved a hit since it went out in 2010, with the first series pulling in an average of 2.6 million viewers.

The BBC asks us to point out that in fact the BBC paid £58 per night, not the £279 quoted.  This rate amounted to a discount of around 50% off the standard rate, substantially less than other hotels in the area and within the BBC expenses policy. Having the team stay in one location simplified travel arrangements to and from the farm. They also say that a crew of 65 is typical for a production of this kind.
