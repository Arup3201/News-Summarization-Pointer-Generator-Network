Solved: The 'man with no name' has been identified as Michael Sutherland, 34, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire

The mystery of a 'man with no name' whose body washed up on an isolated beach almost 25 years ago has at last been solved thanks to advances in forensic science.

When a six-month police investigation failed to establish the identity of a body that washed ashore on a north Norfolk beach in 1989, saddened villagers held a poignant funeral service at a local churchyard.

Now, almost a quarter of a century later, police have used DNA evidence to identify the mystery man as Michael Sutherland, 34, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire.

Mr Sutherland's body was discovered by fishermen on Weybourne beach on October 9th, 1989.

The remarkable breakthrough came after detectives from Norfolk and Suffolk's major investigation team took a fresh look at the region's missing persons cases.

The team carried out an exhumation to obtain DNA from Mr Sutherland's teeth, which was then cross-checked against the missing persons database.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Guy, who said it was rare to solve investigations dating back as far as this one, said: 'On April 19th last year an exhumation was carried out to obtain DNA from Mr Sutherland's body,' he said.

'From the teeth I got a DNA profile and put this on the missing person database and found a match.'

The detective contacted Mr Sutherland's sister, 67-year-old Ann Stockton, of Cleethorpes, to give her the news and finally offer the family some closure.

The painstaking process of re-examining the old cases, some of which go back as far as the early 1960s, is part of a bid to help families desperately hoping to be reunited with their loved ones or at least to find answers regarding their fate, the detective explained.

DCI Guy said unidentified bodies recovered in Norfolk and Suffolk, such as Mr Sutherland’s, were also part of their investigations and the team used a national missing person database to help crack these cases.

'The person is added to the list and is shown as missing. Then we also have a list of human remains. But in this case the home force - the local force - had captured DNA from Mr Sutherland’s family and put it on the database.'

He explained that DNA was usually taken from the missing person but if police were unable to collect any then a virtual profile was made up using family members, such as the mother, father, siblings or children.

It would not have been standard practice to collect DNA before 1995.

Now Mrs Stockton and other members of her brother’s family will be making the 118-mile journey to Norfolk to put him to rest after organising a dedication service at Weybourne’s All Saints Church, where Mrs Stockton will read a eulogy.

Mrs Stockton has said anyone that attended the original service in 1990 was welcome at the dedication for her brother.

The service will be held on November 1st at 10.30am.

Mr Sutherland's family will travel from Cleethorpes to hold a dedication service at Weybourne's All Saints Church next month
