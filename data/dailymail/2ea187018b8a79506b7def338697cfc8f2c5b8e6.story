A British nuclear submarine was today scouring the Indian Ocean as part of the desperate search to find Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

The Royal Naval vessel is part of a huge international effort to trace the missing plane, which vanished with 239 passengers and crew on March 8.

Today it emerged that Hobbit director Peter Jackson has sent his $80million private jet to scour vast swathes of the area where it is believed the plane went down.

Search teams hampered by terrible weather conditions and little information are now battling against the clock as the batteries in the beacon have a 30 day life span. It is 26 days since the Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Royal Navy submarine HMS Tireless, which is said to have 'advanced underwater search capabilities', has arrived in the southern Indian Ocean to help in the search for the missing flight MH370

Royal Navy survey ship HMS Echo is also helping to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 which disappeared on March 8. The extensive search area is currently focused off the coast of Western Australia

There are currently seven countries assisting in the search including New Zealand, Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and the United States with investigations being led by Malaysia.

Last night, the Ministry of Defence confirmed HMS Tireless – a Trafalgar Class submarine - had arrived in the southern Indian Ocean and begun work.

‘She was ordered to move from an operational tasking to the search area around a week ago and arrived on station yesterday’, an MoD source said.

‘HMS Tireless holds advanced search capabilities, but the task in hand remains a tall order and the search area is immense. Her deployment is being co-ordinated closely with our Australian and US colleagues.’

The Royal Navy vessel HMS Echo is also part of the search, which is focussed on an area spanning 98,000 square miles (15,770km).

Britain is also helping with technical assistance and specialist capabilities from across the Ministry of Defence, the Hydrographic Office, Department for Transport and the Met Office to help try to find flight MH370.

As of Tuesday, there were ten planes and nine ships working in the region, 1,217miles (1,960km) west of the Australian city of Perth.

One of these is Peter Jackson’s long-range business jet, a Gulfstream G650 which can carry eight passengers and a crew of four.

It has a non-stop distance of 8,000miles (12,964km) and is considered to be able to fly further and faster than some military aircraft.

'Peter would not seek publicity for something like this and would actively avoid it in fact,' his spokesman Matt Dravitzki told the New Zealand Herald.

'A lot of civilian and military aircraft are involved in the search and it's kind of disappointing that because one is owned by a celebrity it becomes a matter of news when there are [over] 200 people missing.'

The jet, which Sir Peter purchased last March, is primarily being used to help relay communications between other vessels involved in the search.

The British submarine as well as an Australian ship the Ocean Shield are focusing on detecting pings emitted by MH370’s locater, which is attached to the flight data recorder.

It can be heard up to two nautical miles away but this is only in good conditions.

The search for the aircraft will continue long after the batteries on the locater run out but tracking the signal is the most efficient way of finding a downed plane.

Relatives of the missing passengers and crew have faced an agonising wait for news and have been scathing of the Malaysia government’s efforts at handling the crisis.

Yesterday, Malaysian officials said investigators were conducting a forensic examination of the final recorded conversation between ground control and the cockpit, after it changed its account of the final voice transmission from the missing plane.

Unloading of resources by the Australian Navy: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the search for MH370 will continue despite any difficulty, adding: 'If this mystery is solvable, we will solve it.'

International Air Transport Association director general Tony Tyler said the search is "a reminder that we can never be complacent on safety.

The government had transcribed the final voice transmission received by ground controllers at Kuala Lumpur's international airport as ‘All right, good night’, but last night it released a transcript of the conversation which noted the final words as: ‘Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero.’

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said despite the search for the aircraft being slow, difficult and frustrating, it will continue indefinitely.

He said the intensity and magnitude of operations ‘is increasing, not decreasing’, and added: ‘If this mystery is solvable, we will solve it.’

International Air Transport Association (Iata) director general Tony Tyler said there is ‘disbelief’ that flight MH370 ‘could simply disappear’ and a plane must ‘never again go missing in this way’.

The Air France 447 incident, when a plane crashed into the Atlantic in June 2009 claiming 228 lives, had ‘brought similar issues to light a few years ago and some progress was made’.

He added: ‘But that must be accelerated. We cannot let another aircraft simply vanish.’

Mr Tyler added: ‘In 2013, there were over 29 million flights operated on Western-built jet aircraft, with 12 hull losses. That is one accident for every 2.4 million flights and a 14.6% improvement on the five-year industry average.

‘Accidents are rare, but the current search for MH370 is a reminder that we can never be complacent on safety. It may well be a long time before we know exactly what happened on that flight.’

Buddhist monks at a temple in Kuala Lumpur pray for the missing people aboard MH370. The transcript of transmissions from the cockpit have now been released and confirmed to have ended with: 'Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero.'

Malaysian aircraft prepare to continue their search. Seven other nations are currently assisting in the search including New Zealand, Australia, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and the United States.

The current search area in the southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia, 26 days since the plane disappeared. Ten planes and nine ships are believed to be currently engaged in the search.
