The Coast Guard confirmed, and then quickly denied, that the mysterious new barge in San Francisco Bay belongs to Google.

On Wednesday, the Coast Guard visited the barge on Treasure Island, near the Bay Bridge. A spokesman for the Coast Guard said that Google is the owner of the barge, but that they can't say more about the project due to a nondisclosure agreement.

'We can confirm that Google is involved or associated with the barge but there is a nondisclosure agreement in effect; the Coast Guard is unable to discuss or divulge any further details at this time,' Petty Officer 1st Class Thomas McKenzie told CNBC.

Neither confirming or denying: Members of the Coast Guard have confirmed that the mysterious four-story barge in San Francisco Bay is owned by Google. But shortly after making those statements another official retracted them

Under wraps: The San Francisco barge is docked at Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay and is guarded by security and fences

Possible: This large structure parked between San Francisco and Oakland, could be a floating data center being made by Google

But Officer McKenzie's statement was quickly countered by Petty Officer Barry Bena who told the Portland Press Herald that the Coast Guard would not be confirming or denying Google's alleged ownership of the barge.

'Due to issues of commercial confidentiality we are unable to disclose any more information at this time,' Officer Bena said.

Lt Joshua Dykman told the San Jose Mercury News that he hadn't signed a non-disclosure agreement, but had been told by his superiors not to discuss the project because of 'legal reasons'.

'Once the project is completed, we will be releasing information,' he said.

The mystery surrounding the barge in 
San Francisco recently crossed the continent thanks to a similar barge showing up
in the Portland, Maine harbor.

Mystery: This is the Maine barge that is thought to be part of a floating data center project by Google

According
to Coast Guard officials there, no such non-disclosure agreement has 
been set up because work has not started on the barge. Construction is 
expected to start once the San Francisco project wraps.

However, Ensign Connan Ingham says that the Coast Guard officials in Maine know the owner of the Portland barge.

'We have people in the (Coast Guard's) Prevention Department who have been asked by the owner not to talk about it,' Ingham told the Press-Herald. 'They are fully aware of what's on the barge.'

Petty Officer Robert Simpson, spokesman for the Coast Guard in Boston, said it wasn't uncommon for the Coast Guard to enter into a non-disclosure agreement.

But what's piquing interest the most is not whether or not Google owns the barges. CNET put out a pretty convincing story connecting the company to the barges. What they will be used for is more puzzling.

Plans? Sources say Google hopes to tow the completed structure from Treasure Island across the Bay to San Francisco's Fort Mason, where it would be anchored and open to the public

Is this it? A 2009 patent filed by Google shows a water-borne data center

One theory is that they are being built as floating data centers that use ocean water to regulate the intense heat put out by the mass of servers.

Google has refused to comment on the vessels, though a 2009 patent filed by the company describes an environmentally-friendly sea-powered telecommunications and storage system that looks much like the vessels that have appears on both side of the continent.

The Portland Press-Herald reports the Maine barge is docked at the city's Ricker's Warf. Contractors from local engineering firm Cianbro Corp. are installing high-tech equipment in the vessel, though workers said even they didn't know what the purpose of the ship was or who they were working for.

Little is known about them, but they appear to have been registered by someone familiar with geek speak - and with a sense of humor.

The structures are registered with a Delaware corporation as BAL0001, BAL0010, BAL0011 and BAL0100. In binary code used in computing, the numbers spell out 'one,' 'two,' 'three' and 'four.' Currently, numbers 1 and 2 are on the water in San Francisco and No. 3 is in Portland Harbor.

Also, the Delaware company to which they're registered is called Buy and Large, a likely joking reference to 'Buy N Large,' the fictional mega-corporation in the 2008 Pixar film 'WALL-E.'

Google's patent describes 'a system includes a floating platform-mounted computer data center comprising a plurality of computing units, a sea-based electrical generator in electrical connection with the plurality of computing units, and one or more sea-water cooling units for providing cooling to the plurality of computing units.'

Joel Egan, the principal at Cargotecture, which designs custom cargo container buildings, said the structure looks like a data center.

'The cutouts in the long walls of the containers, when they line up, they make hallways,' Egan told CNET. 'You could put all sorts of mainframes into the containers...It doesn't have enough windows for an office building.'

Jonathan Koomey, a Stanford research fellow and expert on data centers, said companies such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft have been installing specially built data centers in shipping containers for some time because they're easy to deploy.

Meanwhile, KPIX 5 reports that Google is actually building a floating marketing center at Hangar 3 for Google Glass, the cutting-edge wearable computer the company has under development.

The media outlet also reported that construction on the site, near the San Francisco Bay Bridge, stopped several weeks ago because Google does not have a permit to park the barge on the waterfront.

Construction on the site commenced last year, and the work is being shielded by a high security fence.
