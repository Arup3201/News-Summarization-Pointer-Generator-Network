Jeremy Clarkson claims the BBC has put him on his final warning for 'appearing' to use the n-word in unaired Top Gear footage - and he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again.

The 54-year-old admitted 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy.

And despite begging for forgiveness less than two days ago for the clip of him saying the nursery rhyme Eeny Meeny Miny Mo, Clarkson also claimed the Corporation had forced him to apologise and he did not want to.

Apology: Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson said he had made 
every effort to make sure he did not use the racist slur in a video less than two days ago - but has now said the apology was the BBC's idea and he didn't want to

Warning: The presenter, pictured apologising, said he is now on his final warning from the Corporation

Writing in his weekly column in The Sun, the presenter compared the apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian civil war because they were both things he had not done.

'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked,' he wrote.

'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head.

'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.'

He also wrote: 'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one.

'An apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's shirt...But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and hoping the story would die down as a result?'

The pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer, he claimed.

A solemn-looking Jeremy Clarkson said the item was recorded a 'couple of years ago' and said he 'did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted'

Eventually, he said, he agreed to say sorry and insisted that when he did, he meant it from the heart.

In his weekly column the presenter added he had 'become Hitler' and was being attacked by people calling for him to join sex offender Max Clifford in jail.

The star became embroiled in controversy after unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two sports cars was leaked to the media.

Historically the rhyme was 'Eeny meeny miny mo, catch a n***** by his toe', and Clarkson said he 'mumbled' in two takes to avoid using the racist term - which made it sound like he was saying it.

In the third, which was broadcast, he said the word 'teacher' instead.

An online petition calling for the BBC presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures.

Intervention: Deputy Labour leader 
Harriet Harman (left) has called for the BBC to sack Clarkson over his 
so-called use of the 'N-word' but Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) has 
urged him to be kept

Labour figures including deputy leader Harriet Harman also demanded he should be sacked.

'Anybody who uses the N-word in public or private in whatever context has no place in the British Broadcasting Corporation,' she wrote on Twitter.

And Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: 'Clarkson announces he has one last chance. He's been in that saloon so long now he must be hammered.'

But Education Secretary Michael Gove urged the BBC not to axe Clarkson because he had been 'clear in his apology'.

And the Prime Minister appeared to agree. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'He does 
share the Education Secretary's view: it is absolutely right that there 
has been an apology.'

Pressed on whether he also shared the 
view he should keep his job, he replied: 'His view is that in terms of 
actions and the like, that's for the BBC.'

Denial: The BBC presenter's first tweet immediately after the storm broke earlier this week

Row: Former newspaper editor Piers Morgan has tweeted regularly about a man who is often his nemesis

In his video apology - which he said took hours to complete because he could not remember his Twitter password - Clarkson said he 'did everything in my power to not use that word'.

He added he was now 'begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough'.

'I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe,' he said.

Controversy: The Top Gear presenter is regularly accused of being offensive

The BBC previously said it had 'left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this'.

The claims come days after the motoring show's producer apologised for broadcasting a 'light-hearted' joke by Clarkson that sparked a complaint of racism.

An episode filmed in Burma and Thailand featured a scene in which the presenters built a bridge over the River Kwai, and as an Asian man walked over it Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it.'

Somi Guha, an actress who complained to the BBC, said the use of the word 'slope' was an example of 'casual racism' and 'gross misconduct'.

In recent years Clarkson has been cleared of breaching the broadcasting code by watchdog Ofcom after comparing a Japanese car to people with growths on their faces.

He previously faced a storm of protest from mental health charities after he branded people who throw themselves under trains as 'selfish' and was forced to apologise for telling BBC1's The One Show that striking workers should be shot.

The motoring show has also faced complaints from Indian and Mexican politicians over remarks made about their countries while filming on location.

A BBC spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We have nothing to add to the statement issued on Thursday.'

That statement said: 'Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode.

'We have made it absolutely clear to him, the standards the BBC expects on air and off.

'We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this.'

'Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations, but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception.

'A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear, in which I quoted the rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe.

'Now, of course, I was well aware that in the best known version of this rhyme, there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid.

'The full rushes show that I did three takes.

'In two I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third, I replaced it all together with the word "teacher".

'Now when I viewed this footage, several weeks later, I realised that in one of the mumbled versions, if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up, it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure.

'I was mortified by this, horrified, it is a word I loathe.

'And I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted.

'In fact, I have here the note I sent at the time to the production office.

'And it says, "I didn't use the n-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. Is there another take that we could use?"

'Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word.

'And as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough.

'Thank you.'
