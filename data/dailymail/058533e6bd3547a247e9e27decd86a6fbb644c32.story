A Bitcoin trader that went bankrupt after claiming hackers had stolen $488million of the digital currency has found almost a quarter of the missing haul... in one of its own accounts.

Online currency exchange Mt. Gox declared itself insolvent in February claiming BTC850,000Â  ($488million) had gone missing, most likely as a result of theft.

But in a humiliating U-turn today, the Tokyo-based firm revealed administrators have unearthed BTC200,000 ($115million) on March 7 in one of its 'old format' digital wallets.

The announcement was made on the group's website by its head, Mark Kapeles, who said the bitcoin stash was found in a bitcoin wallet that was using one of the older formats, and therefore escaped the exchange's initial searches.

The online exchange for the virtual currency was unplugged in late February as rumors of its insolvency swirled, adding to doubts about the viability of bitcoins overall.

It then filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo and said nearly all its 850,000 bitcoins were missing, most likely as a result of theft. About 750,000 of the bitcoins belonged to people who used the Mt. Gox exchange.

Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as the Bank of England.

The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.

Its popularity soared at the end of last year as websites, shops and pubs around the world began accepting it as a form of payment, while US regulators clamped down on those using it to buy drugs and illegal goods.

The value of a single Bitcoin broke through the $1,000 barrier for the first time at the end of November, having been worth around $120 for most of the year.

Bitcoin is now trading around $575.

'I am sorry for the troubles I have caused all the people,' Karpeles, a Frenchman, said in Japanese at a Tokyo court.

Karpeles had not made a public appearance since rumors of the exchange's insolvency surfaced.

The loss was a giant setback to the currency's image because its boosters have promoted bitcoin's cryptography as protecting it from counterfeiting and theft.

Just hours before the bankruptcy filing, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso had scoffed that a collapse was only inevitable.

'No one recognizes them as a real currency,' he told reporters. 'I expected such a thing to collapse.'

Japan's financial regulators have been reluctant to intervene in the Mt. Gox situation, saying they don't have jurisdiction over something that's not a real currency.

Bitcoin proponents have insisted that Mt. Gox is an isolated case, caused by the company's technological failures, and the potential of virtual currencies remains great.

At current prices, the rediscovered bitcoins have a market value of about $115 million.

Mt. Gox's problems have been a setback for bitcoin, a virtual currency that has grown in popularity since its 2009 creation as a way to make transactions across borders without third parties such as banks.

The restoration of some of the missing virtual currency is potentially good news for bitcoin enthusiasts who invested at Mt. Gox but also raises further questions about the running of the exchange.

Mt. Gox's statement said the 200,000 bitcoins had been moved to offline wallets. It didn't specify the type but offline wallets include USB sticks and paper documents.
