At the entrance to a mountain village in Bosnia, people are greeted by the Islamic State emblem.

New photographs show the distinctive ISIS flag adorning buildings and the symbol is painted on a sign in Gornja Maoca, which is home to  followers of the radical Wahhabi movement.

It is believed some 150 Bosnians have joined Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq.

The 26-year-old was locked in a cage, doused with fuel and torched.

However, radical Muslims are a minority in Bosnia, which has a mostly moderate and secular Muslim population.

But Gornja Maoca is home to Bosnian followers of Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam.

In April, Bosnia introduced jail terms of up to 10 years for citizens who fight or recruit fighters for conflicts abroad.

The move was aimed at discouraging young Bosnians, some of whom, particularly from rural areas, have in recent years adhered to the puritanical Wahhabi sect, from going to fight in Syria.

In September, Bosnian police detained 16 people on charges of financing terrorist activities, recruiting and fighting for radical groups in Syria and Iraq, authorities said.

The arrests were made in 17 raids by a combined 200 police across the Balkan country. Television footage showed police making arrests in Gornja Maoca.

Militant Islam was all but unknown to Bosnia's mostly secular Muslim population until the 1990s Balkans wars when Arab mercenaries turned up to help the outgunned Bosnian Muslims fend off Serb attacks. 

These fighters, many of whom settled in Bosnia, embraced a radical version of Islam that Bosnia's official Islamic community opposes.
