New Year’s Eve partygoers in Britain were today told to expect a dry evening with temperatures up to double figures as they welcome in 2015.

The mild forecast  - with 10C (50F) expected in Plymouth - was issued as the country prepared to bid farewell to one of the warmest years on record.

People watching fireworks in London will enjoy a dry but breezy and cloudy evening with the Met Office forecasting a temperature of 6C (43F).

Western parts of the country should expect rain in the evening, although this is likely to become lighter as midnight approaches.

The rest of the United Kingdom may be cloudy too, but it should remain dry throughout the evening.

The alert - running from 11am to 9pm - covers south-west Scotland, Wales, Yorkshire and Humber, and the North of England.

And the Environment Agency issued one flood alert at 3pm today for the North Sea coast at Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

Treacherous road conditions in the cold weather have cost at least six lives since Boxing Day, with the latest two on Monday in Somerset and Sussex. 

And according to the Met Office the last few days have seen some of the coldest temperatures of the year so far.

Cromdale in Moray, Scotland, saw -9C (15.8F) in the early hours of December 27, the coldest the country has seen this year.

This was reflected in the rest of the UK with England, Wales and Northern Ireland having their lowest temperatures of 2014 so far the following night.

This is despite experts suggesting this year could be the UK’s warmest, as measured by the world’s oldest temperature record over almost 250 years.

The 11 months from January to November have already been the warmest period on the Met Office’s Central England Temperature record.

A spokesman for MeteoGroup said: ‘It will be a good evening to be out as it is mostly dry over much of England.

‘The North and West might see some patchy rain, as will Scotland, but it won’t be a bad night for being outside anywhere.’

The Met Office warned conditions are set to change from the current crisp winter days, with a rise in temperatures and more unsettled, windy weather.

Through New Year’s Day, it will gradually turn wet and windy across the whole of the country - but it should stay mild tomorrow and on Friday.

However, from Saturday temperatures will be falling back to those more commonly seen earlier this week - with 6C (43F) expected in central London.

Today at 7am there was a huge contrast in temperatures across England, with -6C (21F) in south Oxfordshire and 10C in west Cornwall.

Yesterday's warmest place was Achnagart in the Highlands at 10.6C (51.1F) - while Bude in Cornwall saw the most sunshine, of seven hours.

++ 2014 RECORDS ++ HOTTEST TEMPERATURE: 32.3C IN GRAVESEND (JULY) ++ COLDEST: -9C IN CROMDALE, MORAY (DECEMBER) ++ HIGHEST WIND: 109MPH ON NEEDLES, ISLE OF WIGHT (FEBRUARY) ++ WETTEST DAY: 5.8IN IN ENNERDALE, CUMBRIA (MARCH) ++

Global warming has ‘substantially increased’ the chance of temperature records being broken in the UK, with 2014 set to be the country's hottest year on record, weather experts have said.

The UK's average temperature is expected to be 9.9C (49.8F) this year - the warmest in records dating back to 1910 and beating the previous highest of 9.7C (49.5F) set in 2006, according to the Met Office. It means that the UK's top eight warmest years have been recorded since 2002.

2014 is also set to be the hottest on record in the Central England Temperature (CET) series, which has recorded temperatures in an area of England since 1659 and is the longest-running record of instrumental temperature measurements in the world.

The average temperature is expected to be 11C (51.8F), which would beat the previous record of 10.9C (51.6F) set in 2006.The Met Office said that while there had been no ‘record-breaking’ individual months for temperatures, every month, except August, had been warmer than average.

A spokesman said: ‘Although individual months were unremarkable, it was the persistence of the warmth that was unusual and together they add up to something record-breaking. 

'Human influence on the climate is likely to have substantially increased the chance of breaking the UK and CET temperature records. Estimates from the Met Office suggest that it has become about 10 times more likely for the UK record to be broken as a result of human influence on the climate.’

The Met Office used temperature figures from January to December 28, and assumed average weather conditions for the final three days of the year.

It has also been notably wet in 2014, after the UK recorded its fifth wettest year since records dating back to 1910. Some 1290mm (50.8in) of rain fell up to December 28 - just 5mm (0.2in) short of the fourth wettest year in 2008 but with three days of the year remaining.

The Met Office said the winter of 2013/2014 was the UK's wettest in records since 1910, and in the long-running England and Wales precipitation series from 1766. May, August, October and November were also wetter than average, while August was especially wet in northern Scotland.

The remaining months were mostly drier than average, with September the driest on record since 1910 with just 22.1mm (0.87in) of rain. Gravesend in Kent recorded the UK's highest temperature of the year after the mercury soared to 32.3C (90.1F) on July 18. 

Cromdale, in Moray, Scotland saw the lowest temperature of -9C (15.8F) on December 27. However the Met Office said this was ‘unusually mild’ as temperatures usually fall below -10 B0C (14F) and often -15 B0C (5F). 

The highest wind of 109mph was recorded at the Needles, Old Battery, on the Isle of Wight, on February 14. Meanwhile, Ennerdale in Cumbria saw the UK's wettest day in 2014 after 146.8mm (5.78in) of rain fell on March 6.
