A grandmother has had an 'incredible escape' after a driver passed out at the wheel of his car and crashed through the living room of her bungalow, partially demolishing it.

Marianne Heath was just metres away in her bedroom when the £25,000 Audi convertible veered off the road and smashed through her wooden gate, down her drive and through the living room wall of her home.

Mrs Heath, 72, said: 'I had an incredible escape. A few minutes later I would have been right there - but now there's a huge hole in my house.'

The 60-year-old driver is recovering in 
hospital after the crash in Gowerton,
 Swansea, with his new car a write-off. His injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

It is believed he collapsed at the wheel while driving with the top down - and his new Audi A3 careered out of control down the one-way street into the bungalow.

The widow said she heard a huge crash from her living room.

She said: 'I was getting ready to welcome her grandchildren and all of us would have been in the living room just moments later.

'It happened around 7am. I had just got up and was sitting on the bed when I hear a loud rumbling sound.

'I tried to get into the lounge but the door wouldn't open, so I opened the back door and went outside.

'When I walked around the corner I saw this car. It was unbelievable.

'I'm still shaking, I can't take it all in - the damage is terrible. I tried to dial 999 but the house phone was down because of the crash.

'But then a neighbour called 999 and it all happened in minutes - with a load of ambulances, fire engines and police cars.

'I have never seen so many emergency vehicles in my life.'

The mother-of-three then saw the driver trapped inside his vehicle.

She said: 'He was moving his arm when I came out of the house, I told him to stay where he was - not that he could have got out. They took quite a while to cut him out.'

A spokesman for South Wales Police said: 'Police were called to a road traffic collision when a black Audi collided with a bungalow.

'A 60-year-old driver was taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea where his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.'
