'There was a wound in his neck. The neck was almost cut entirely,' Detective Wardana told reporters.

'We suspect that there has been physical violence to the body.' 

Police say Mr Ellis' Indonesian wife, Noor, reported him missing and has identified him from a photograph.

She was yet to make a positive identification at the morgue. 

Detectives have found a mat at the crime scene, which they believe was used to move Mr Ellis' body, as well as money and a mobile phone.

Ida Bagus Putu Alit, head of forensics at Sanglah Hospital, confirmed the injuries, saying an autopsy found bruising on the man's face, and three open wounds in the neck.

'The fatal wounds were caused by sharp-object violence,' he said.
