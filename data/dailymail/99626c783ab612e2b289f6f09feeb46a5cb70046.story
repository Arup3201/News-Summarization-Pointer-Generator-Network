The idea of coming out to your parents or loved ones by way of a digitalised recorded message from David Hasselhoff may seem the pinnacle of bizarre, but that is precisely what makers of a new app propose.

Celebrity Video Messages has 40 celebrities on its books, including David Hasselhoff, Shane Richie, Sinitta, and Warwick Davis, who will record bespoke, personalised messages for anyone for a modest fee (from £10-100).

The makers say they expect most of the messages will be for things like Happy Birthday, Get Well Soon, Good luck on your exams, or the occasional proposal of marriage.

Sign up to get The Hoff, left, to tell your folks something you can't face doing yourself, or maybe choose Sinitta, right, instead

However they also envisage the app will be used to convey other messages.

As well as being use by people who want to come out about their sexuality, the app could be used to heal a family rift (for who could resist the wisdom of the Hoff) or to encourage a dieter on their weight loss journey.

In fact any of the 40 celebrities will say anything you wish for a set price.

But not all celebrities are created equal, and a few seconds of talk from David Hasselhoff will set you back $100 (or about £70), while a message from Simon Cowel’s ex Sinitta is a bargain at just £15, while former Hear Say singer Suzanne Shaw is a rather specific £27.50.

Just $100, or about £70 can buy you the Hoff on a screen, for a few seconds

Actor and singer Shane Ritchie is just one of the 40 or so celebrities who have already signed up to the website

Other stars who have signed up to the venture include Game of Thrones’ Ian McElhinney, Star Trek: Phase II actor Vic Mignogna, and presenter and DJ Pat Sharp.

Once you have paid, you simply say what message you want recording and the video will be sent to you in between ‘a few days to a few weeks’. However, if your chosen celebrity has gone all diva and is taking too long to record your message, you can cancel your request and get your money back.

Still in its early stages, Celebrity Video Messages hopes to continue to expand and bring more celebrities on board.
