Fallen Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes will be farewelled in a touching ceremony in his hometown of Macksville, with his father Greg, brother Jason and close friend Michael Clarke acting as pall bearers on Wednesday.

The five other pall bearers will be Corey Ireland, Mitchell Lonergan, Matthew Day, Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper - who was Hughes' batting partner at the time of last Tuesday's tragedy that claimed his life.

Devastated residents will get the chance to farewell their 'favourite son' as thousands of people from Australia and overseas inundate the 2,600-strong town in New South Wales.

It is the same song Elton John dedicated to Hughes at his concert in Germany.

The South Australian batsman died two days after he was hit in the neck by a bouncer during day one of the Sheffield Shield last Tuesday. 

Performing in Munich, Germany at Olympiahalle Arena on Thursday night, cricket fan John told his large crowd of fans: 'I am a big huge sports fan and I love cricket which you don’t know anything about over here.'

The night before the funeral, Clarke shared an Instagram photo of himself with his arms around Hughes.

Tomorrow is going to be a tough day!' he wrote.

Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke was close friends with Phillip Hughes and will be one of the eight pall bearers

Australian skipper Michael Clarke will also read a tribute during the service. 

Eulogies will be read by Nino Ramunno as sibilings Jason Hughes and Megan Hughes.

The service will be led by Father Michael Alcock.

Other sporting legends who will be attending include Shane Warne, Mike Hussey, Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist as well as the Australian Test squad and Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars.

Hughes' agent James Henderson told reporters the family wanted to stress that Wednesday's service was for the Macksville community and surrounding areas.

Preparations have already begun for service, with the Australian Test squad also expected to be in attendance

An outpouring of support has come from Australia and across the world for the Hughes family, following the tragedy

The town of Macksville will stop on Wednesday to honour the late cricketer

'Phil's community is this community. Whilst there is a lot of people [coming from] interstate or overseas, 80 per cent of the hall will be set aside for local people,' he said.

'For the people who are unable to get in the hall, the family has made arrangements for several overflow areas at the high school, so everybody can come celebrate Phillip’s life.'

These areas are expected to cater for up to 2,000 people.

After the service, people will line the streets to pay their final respects as the hearse makes its way down Macksville's main street.

'Tomorrow evening the town will stop and celebrate Phillip’s life,' Mr Henderson said.

'[With media coverage], there is not one Australian tomorrow who cannot be with us here in Macksville to celebrate Phillip’s life.

'Hughesy was a really no-fuss guy, and I know he would be looking down at all of this and wondering what the hell was going on. 

'He's made… an unbelievable impression on this country and the family would like to thank everybody for that.'

The service will start at 2pm AEDT on Wednesday.
