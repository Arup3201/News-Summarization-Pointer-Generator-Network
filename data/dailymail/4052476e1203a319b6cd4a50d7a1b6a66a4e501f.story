It seems that Hillary is not the only Clinton to be in the wars lately as daughter Chelsea stepped out with a plaster on her leg.

But despite the unsightly fashion faux-pas,Chelsea was all smiles in New York yesterday after speaking about mother and U.S. Secretary of State, who was hospitalised earlier this month when doctors detected a blood clot in her head during a routine checkup.

The spotlight has been on the 32-year-old from New York following rumours that she may be considering moving into politics after accepting the role of honorary chair for the National Day of Service tomorrow.

In the wars: Chelsea Clinton stepped out in New York with a plaster on her leg yesterday as rumors swirled that she may be considering moving into politics after accepting the role of honorary chair for the National Day of Service tomorrow

Speaking on the TODAY show she said of her mother: 'She is exuding the energy, the vibrancy and certainly the mental acuity that she always has.

'I’m so grateful that she is not only fine, but healthy and vibrant and strong and, God willing, will be for the next 65 years of her life.'

New role: Chelsea will be the honorary chair after participating in the festivities as an adolescent when her father was in office

Acting as the all-day summit’s 
honorary chair is a new role for the woman who participated in the 
festivities as an adolescent, standing next to her father, Bill Clinton,
as he was sworn into office in 1993 and 1997.

She will headline a service summit on
the National Mall for the president's call for Americans to honor the 
legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the holiday weekend celebrating 
his birthday.

She will join other participants 
including actresses Eva Longoria and Angela Bassett, singers Ben Folds 
and Yolanda Adams, television personality Star Jones and Delaware 
Attorney General Beau Biden, the vice president's son.

Hillary is in such excellent shape that ‘she had time for three more husbands’, Bill Clinton said.

He said: 'She's always been very, very healthy and she has very low blood pressure, very low standing heartbeat. 

'I tell her that, you know, she's still got time to have three more husbands after me. So, I think she'll live to be 120.’

Chelsea was often seen but not heard as a youth growing up in the White House, but increasingly has made her public voice heard in recent years.

She campaigned for her mom, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's, 2008 presidential primary campaign against Obama and now is an NBC News special correspondent.

Last fall she traveled to Nigeria on 
behalf of her father's charitable foundation, meeting with the country's
president and promoting the Clinton Health Access Initiative's efforts 
to reduce child mortality there. 

A week after Election Day, she 
appeared at the Glamour Women of the Year awards in New York with a 
stage full of women who had been involved in races across the country, 
noting that gender progress was made in 2012 although there still is a 
long way to go.

She has promoted efforts to allow gay marriage and assisted in raising money for victims of Hurricane Sandy.

Chelsea said: ‘When I was growing up, both my parents and grandparents instilled a commitment to service in me.  

‘They taught me that helping our neighbors and serving our community were essential parts of being a good citizen and a good person.’
