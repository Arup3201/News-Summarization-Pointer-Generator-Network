With this much hair to contend with, bathtime was bound to have an extra twist. And when Daz needed to look his best for dog show Crufts, which runs till Sunday, it was never going to be a case of just ‘wash and go’.

Instead, an eight-hour clean-up operation ensued for the dread-locked Komondor — involving three hours in the tub, then five more under a vast array of dryers.

Thankfully, placid Daz soaks up the attention as well as the suds.

It takes a lot of water to lather Daz up, according to his owner

The 10st 7lb five-year-old stands 33in to the shoulder and is one of around only 45 of his breed in the UK. Puppies, which cost upwards of £1,200, are born with downy coats that develop into dreadlocks (or, to be correct, ‘cords’).

Komondors are known as ‘the ultimate sheep-dog’ in Hungary, their country of origin, where their thick, shaggy hair protected them from the wolves and bears which threatened farmers’ flocks.

The cleaning process — at his owner Julie Branch’s dog grooming parlour — starts with Daz stepping into a hydrobath, which has a door for easy access. The first challenge is to get his dense coat wet enough. Miss Branch, 52, of Harlow, Essex, said: ‘It’s quite wiry and coarse, so it takes a lot of water before you can lather him up.’

Then its four shampoos and separate rinses before the conditioner goes on and a final rinse.

A rubdown with a towel follows, plus a once-over with a ‘wet-and-dry’ vacuum cleaner to suck out as much water as possible. Then it’s out with the arsenal of hairdryers.

They include a £300 X Power Airmover, which gusts cool air over Daz from its three large black hoses — and which is nicknamed ‘Octopussy’ by Miss Branch.

‘If we left him to dry naturally, it’d probably take up to four days,’ said Julie’s partner Barry Davison, 61, who runs a courier business.

Finally, Daz slips into a fetching green onesie that helps keep his locks spotless and means he can carry on as normal until show day.

Daz, whose pedigree name is Jabenezer Zolltan, will be at the Birmingham NEC today in the working and pastoral breeds section, where he has previously won Top Dog in the Komondor class.

Needless to say, this year he’s hoping for a clean sweep of even more prestigious titles.
