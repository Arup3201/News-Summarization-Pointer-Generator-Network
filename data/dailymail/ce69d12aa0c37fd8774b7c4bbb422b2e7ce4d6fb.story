James Rodriguez has signed a six-year deal to complete his £60million move to Real Madrid.

The World Cup Golden Boot winner will be unveiled at the Bernabeu at 7pm on Tuesday evening as Real snap up world football's hottest prospect.

The 23-year-old playmaker will link up with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale to create one of the world's most feared attacking line-ups.

A Real Madrid statement read: 'Real Madrid have reached an agreement with Monaco for the transfer of James Rodriguez, who will join the club for the next six seasons.

'The player will be presented today, Tuesday 22 July, at 20:00 (Spanish time), in the Santiago Bernabeu's presidential box.

'Following that, James Rodriguez will take his first steps on the Santiago Bernabeu's pitch wearing the Real Madrid shirt and will attend the media in the press room.'

Monaco CEO Vadim Vasilyev wished the departing star well, a year on from when the French club signed Rodriguez for £35million from Porto.

'AS Monaco are proud to have helped James Rodriguez reveal his talent to the world, especially in becoming top scorer of the World Cup in Brazil.

'The club had no intention to sell the player. There came a time when we considered the solution of a transfer would be beneficial to all parties.'

Rodriguez was one of the revelations of the World Cup, scoring in each of Colombia's games as they reached the quarter-finals of the competition for the very first time, eventually losing 2-1 to hosts Brazil.

In total Rodriguez scored six goals at the World Cup to finish as the leading scorer - one clear of Thomas Muller - while his stunning 25-yard volley against Uruguay was voted goal of the tournament on FIFA.com.

His signing comes less than a week after Madrid brought in another of the World Cup's star performers in Germany's Toni Kroos, who moved from Bayern Munich for a reported £24million.
