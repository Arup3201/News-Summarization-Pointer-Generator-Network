For most hotels the key selling point is a room with a view, particularly if it towers over a bustling cityscape or sprawling countryside.

But designers behind this new luxury resort have gone in the completely opposite direction to attract customers - by creating a 'groundscraper' hotel built 16 floors beneath the earth's surface.

The hugely ambitious underground hotel project will see a 19-storey, 380-room structure chiselled out of a giant quarry in Songjiang, near Shanghai.

Unique: The hotel will feature an aquarium and water sports features at the base of its grand building

Designers have set aside a site about 
30 miles from the city of Shanghai, in an abandoned quarry at the foot 
of Tianmashan Mountain.

While
towering skyscrapers boast of rooftop restaurants and penthouse luxury,
the InterContinental Shimao Shanghai Wonderland's bottom two floors 
will include an underwater restaurant, athletic complex for water sports
and 10-metre deep aquarium.

Surrounding
the unique hotel will be a 428,000 square-metre theme park, complete 
with room for bungee jumping and rock climbing overlooking the 
descending 16 floors.

Project
developers Shimao Property Group worked with British engineering firm 
Atkins to design the imaginative hotel, which they hope to complete in 
late 2014 or early 2015.

It is thought the vast project will cost at least $555 million, with nightly rooms starting at around $320.
