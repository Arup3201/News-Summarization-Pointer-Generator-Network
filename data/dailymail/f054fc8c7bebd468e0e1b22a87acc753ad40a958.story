One has had some impressive birthday presents in the past, but this was the most spiffing of all.

Prince Charles received an unusual treat for his 64th when he had a preview of costumes and props used in the new film of JRR Tolkien’s classic children’s story The Hobbit in Wellington, New Zealand.

A dwarf from the film, played by Mark Hadlow, offered his service, dropping to one knee and saying in a booming voice that he had been released ‘for you to command as you see fit, your servant Dori’.

Charles - who was being given a behind
the scenes tour of director Sir Peter Jackson’s new film - laughed and 
replied to the dwarf: ’This is the best birthday present I’ve had for a 
long time.’

Speaking about 
making the film, the actor said: ‘It was fantastic, we were filming for 
18 months and the whole thing was an extraordinary experience.

‘It
was like being back at boarding school. We were the naughty dwarves and
only Peter Jackson could keep us in check and eventually he joined in.’

The
royal was shown weapons and costumes from The Hobbit: An Unexpected 
Journey, the first part in a trilogy which receives its world premiere 
at the end of the month in Wellington.

dwarf Gloin, was part-way through a three-hour make-up process when 
Charles met him.

The dwarf’s big ears stuck out as he 
sat in a chair and he shared a laugh with the Prince, who is 5ft 9in tall.

Hambleton said: 
’I’m looking forward to meeting William and Kate at the premiere in 
London.’

Speaking about making the film, he 
said: ‘We started make-up at 4.30am to get into character and we worked 
up to 16-hour days.’ Charles also met William Kircher who plays 
Bifur in the film.

As the 
Prince left, schoolchildren held up a poster painted with the words 
‘happy birthday’ and sang to him. Earlier in the day Charles and Camilla
had greeted large crowds in Wellington.

They celebrated his birthday in New 
Zealand, the final stop of their Pacific tour to mark the Queen’s 
Diamond Jubilee which has already taken them to Australia and Papua New 
Guinea.

Prince Charles to Dori

To the strains of 
the Beatles' famous tune When I’m Sixty-Four, the Prince cut his birthday
cake - one of 64 waiting to be eaten - and even danced to the song.

The Prince was joined by 64 Kiwis, aged from 18 to 101 who were also born on November 14, and Governor General Sir Jerry Mateparae, 58, and Bronagh Key, 49, wife of the Prime Minister John Key, who also share their birthday with Charles.

Earlier in the day the royal couple opened a Diamond Jubilee gift for the Queen - a visitor centre in the grounds of Wellington’s Government House.

Charles joked: ‘It’s a jolly good day for Scorpios to unite', and he added: ‘But of course I couldn’t think of a better, happier place to spend my birthday then here with all of you in New Zealand.’

'It was fantastic, we were filming for 18 months and the whole thing was an extraordinary experience. It was like being back at boarding school. We were the naughty dwarves and only Peter Jackson could keep us in check and eventually he joined in'

The royal birthday party was staged at Government House and the Prince and Sir Jerry were ushered over to a table covered with the 64 cakes made from a mixture of dark fruits and boiled sultanas.

Charles stared at the sweet treats each decorated with New Zealand symbols, from the silver fern and kiwi fruit to images of native birds. The two men each cut a cake as the Central Band of the New Zealand Airforce began playing When I’m Sixty-Four.

At first the Prince looked over to the musicians and raised his eyebrows in resignation but then he started bobbing up and down to the music and moving his hands from side to side as he smiled.
