David Cameron today confronted SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon over her promise to have her Scottish MPs vote on the future of the English NHS.

The Prime Minister used a meeting in Edinburgh with the Scottish First Minister to make clear his anger at the idea that English laws should be decided by nationalists from north of the border.

In his first speech in Scotland since the independence referendum, Mr Cameron promised to make Holyrood one of the 'most powerful devolved parliaments in the world'.

David Cameron today met First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to discus further devolution to Scotland

Mr Cameron's visit is designed to honour a 'vow' made in the final days of the independence campaign to hand more powers to Scots if they decided to stay in the Union.

But it has been overshadowed by Ms Sturgeon's shock plan to end its long-standing policy of not voting on devolved issues such as health and education. 

A new Ipsos Mori poll for STV News found 52 per cent of Scots are planning to vote SNP in May. 

That would give the Nationalists an incredible 55 of Scotland's 59 seats, with Scottish Labour reduced to a rump of only four MPs - with the Tories and the Lib Dems completely wiped out.

It would shatter Labour's hopes of an overall majority, and would leave Ed Miliband reliant on SNP votes to pass laws - including those which only affect England. 

Paving the way for a power-sharing deal with Labour, Ms Sturgeon insisted any vote on the English NHS had knock-on effects in Scotland because the Edinburgh government’s budget is linked to Westminster spending.

She said it was necessary to protect the Scottish NHS from the knock on effects of cuts and privatisation in England.

The SNP leader told the BBC: ‘We would be prepared to vote on matters of English health because that has a direct impact on Scotland's budget.

‘So if there was a vote in the House of Commons to repeal the privatisation of the health service as has been seen in England to restore the National Health Service we would vote for that because that would help to protect Scotland's budget.

‘If there are decisions taken to further privatise the NHS in England, and I don't think anybody thinks the Tories are progressively privatising the health service in order to increase the public funding of the health service, so decisions are taken, that reduce over time the public funding of the health service in England then that has a direct knock on effect to Scotland's budget.’

Tory defence minister Anna Soubry branded the remarks 'complete twaddle' and warned Ms Sturgeon was putting the Union at risk again.

'She doesn't even understand what's happened and this nonsense - and it is a nonsense - that the Conservatives are on some wide-scale privatisation of the NHS. She puts our Union at risk again and plays with dangerous stuff.'

Mr Cameron sought to repaid the damage caused by the referendum campaign when he reveals the draft clauses that will underpin the devoltion of new powers to Scotland.

The Tory leader stressed that these new powers are 'guaranteed', regardless of who wins May's general election 

Mr Cameron promised the Scottish Parliament will be able to 'combine the freedom to decide what happens in Scotland's schools, hospitals, surgeries and police stations and the responsibility of determining how around 60 per cent of public money in Scotland is spent'.

He declared: 'The Scottish Parliament will have more control of its tax and spending - making it one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world.

'For the first time - the majority of the money the Scottish Parliament spends will be raised right here in Scotland.

'This includes a substantial new package of welfare powers - worth £2.5 billion - to tackle long term unemployment, disability and poverty.

'We've already moved to allow the Scottish Parliament to extend its franchise so 16 and 17 year olds could vote at the 2016 Holyrood elections and here we are stating in law the permanence of the Scottish Parliament - so there can never be any question: Holyrood is here to stay.'

With Scots having voted to stay part of the UK in last September's independence vote, Mr Cameron claimed that decision 'wasn't just about the future of devolution' adding that people north of the border value 'the safety and security of being part of something bigger, our family of nations'.

Mr Cameron said in the referendum campaign 'the leaders of the other main political parties and I promised extensive new powers for the Scottish Parliament - a vow - with a clear process and timetable'.

He added: 'We said a command paper would be ready by the end of October - and it was.

'We said we'd get cross-party agreement by St. Andrew's Day - and we did.

'We said draft legislation would be published by Burns Night - and here we are, three days before the celebrations start, with those clauses before us.'

But the SNP claims the new powers do not go far enough. 

Scottish Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who was on the Commission along with representatives from Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, said: 'The proposals which Mr Cameron publishes today must live up to the word and spirit of the Smith Commission. Scotland should not - and will not - accept anything less.

'While the Smith Commission recommendations did not go as far as we wanted, and do not live up to the 'vow' made before the independence referendum, we welcome them, and they must now be delivered in full.'

Mr Swinney said there is still 'a long way to go before these proposals are put into law'.

He added: 'What we have today is the start of the process to develop a Westminster Bill which has widespread support for introduction shortly after this year's general election.

'We will be working closely with stakeholders to ensure these proposals are right for Scotland and that they reflect the views of ordinary people. The Scottish Government is focused on securing economic growth, tackling inequality and protecting our public services, and the new powers being delivered must help deliver those goals.

'We will carefully examine today's paper, because anything which backtracks, waters down or falls short of what Lord Smith recommended would be unacceptable - and ultimately it is the people of Scotland who will determine if these proposals go far enough.'

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said after the referendum campaign 'as promised the UK has today delivered unprecedented new powers for Scotland, which make it one of the most powerful devolved administrations in the OECD'.

The Liberal Democrat said: 'The next steps are clear: the Scottish Government and Parliament will soon have these powers, and it needs to ensure that it implements them in a way that works for Scotland, including by looking at further devolution within the country, as recommended by Lord Smith.

'Devolution doesn't just mean the flow of powers from one Parliament to another. Devolution is about empowering our regions and our communities across Scotland and the UK.'
