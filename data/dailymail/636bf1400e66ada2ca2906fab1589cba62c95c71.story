More clashes erupted in Egypt yesterday following President Mohammed Mursi’s seizure of ‘Pharaoh-like’ powers.

The latest confrontations broke out 
between protesters and security forces in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, while demonstrations also erupted outside the capital.

It follows his declaration on 
Thursday that courts could not overturn any decree or law he has issued 
since taking office in June.

The move sparked fierce and widespread 
protests amid fears it could mark a return to the type of dictatorship 
that was removed in the democratic revolution last year.

Divisions between supporters of the president and those who resent his seizure of increased powers have widened.

The sides are divided over President Mohammed Mursi and the Islamist movement that he once led.

But both sides are planning to escalate action in the coming days.

The opposition has called for an open-ended sit-in at Cairo’s Tahrir Square ‘to defend the revolution and the Egyptian state’.

It is also planning a major protest on Tuesday.

The general assembly of the Egypt Judges Club called for a nationwide strike in all courts and prosecution offices to begin on Monday, until further notice.

The Supreme Judicial Council called the decree an ‘unprecedented attack on the independence of the judiciary and its decisions’.

But the Muslim Brotherhood – the movement Mursi once led and from which he retains his powerbase – has announced a ‘million man’ demonstration on Tuesday in Cairo to support the president.

Yesterday saw clashes in Tahrir Square – the focal point of the uprising last year that forced long-term leader Hosni  Mubarak out of office – between rival groups of demonstrators.

White tents dotted the area, just as they
did during 2011, and protesters there said they wouldn’t leave until 
Mursi rescinds his decrees.

One critic of the president, Mohamed Abdul Wahab, said Mursi’s latest move threatened to make him ‘a new Pharaoh’.

He added: ‘Actually, there was never a Pharaoh like this before because Mubarak, with all  his arrogance and dictatorial tendencies, never gave himself the power that no one can appeal his decisions.

Protesters tried to attack offices of the Muslim Brotherhood in the early hours of Sunday in the northern city of Damanhour, while supporters of the movement fought back, and arrests and injuries were reported.
