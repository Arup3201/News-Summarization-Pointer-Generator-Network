Robin van Persie and Holland may have had to settle for finishing third in the World Cup, but their army of supporters don't seem to be fretting too much about what could have been.

Louis van Gaal's Dutch team, dressed in matching blue cardigans and the staff in their trademark suits, landed in Rotterdam to thousands of fans desperate for a glimpse of their World Cup heroes.

Holland were tantelisingly close to Sunday's final, but ultimately could not get past a determined Argentina side, who won 4-2 in the penalty shoot-out.

Third: Holland could not reach the World Cup final as they were beaten 4-2 on penalties by Argentina

Manchester United's Van Persie was grateful for the warm welcome, writing 'Home sweet home!!!!' with a video of the fans that turned up to greet the Holland side.

Holland saw off host nation Brazil 3-0 on Saturday night to finish third overall out of the 32 teams.

That came courtesy of a Van Persie penalty in the third minute, before Daley Blind and Georginio Wijnaldum heaped further misery on Brazil, who were pre-tournament favourites to lift the trophy.
