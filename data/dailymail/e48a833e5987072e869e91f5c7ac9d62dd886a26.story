The bleak outlook for the North Sea oil industry was laid bare yesterday when BP became the latest to slash jobs.

In a blow to the Scottish economy as well as the thousands of workers employed in the oil sector, BP revealed it was cutting 200 onshore workers and 100 contractor roles from its 3,500 staff in the North Sea.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude – the global benchmark – has more than halved since June and stands at around $48 (£31.50). It could tumble as low as $31 (£20.44) by April, according to forecasters at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

But the weak oil price also undermines nationalists’ claims that an independent Scotland can rely on its natural resources. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, appearing before the Treasury Select Committee earlier this week, called the oil price fall a ‘negative shock for Scotland’.

The collapse in oil prices has already seen a number of major firms scrap projects, cut jobs and slash wages – and the North Sea sector is now at ‘crisis’ point, according to experts.

US-based North Sea oil producer Conoco-Phillips is to cut 230 British jobs, while Royal Dutch Shell and Qatar are to shelve a £4.3billion project in the Middle East.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who travelled to Aberdeen yesterday to meet industry leaders, said the Government was ‘determined to do everything we can’ to save jobs. He announced he has appointed Andy Samuel, head of the Oil And Gas Authority industry regulator, to lead an ‘urgent commission’ into ‘practical measures to mitigate the immediate risks’.

Sir Ian Wood, who recently completed a review of the UK’s offshore oil businesses, said that as many as 15,000 jobs could be lost in the industry, which employs more than 450,000 staff across the country, with around 62,000 directly in exploration.

The falling oil price has been caused by a rapid growth of US shale output, and the refusal of Opec – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – to cut production, which would push it back up.

Malcolm Webb, chief executive of the industry body Oil & Gas UK, called for urgent action to halt the decline and asked the Treasury to radically reduce the tax burden on British oil firms.

Fergus Ewing, the Scottish government’s energy minister, described it as ‘the most serious jobs situation Scotland has faced in living memory’.

Tom Greatrex, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘It is vital the UK and devolved Scottish governments, regulators and industry work together to minimise damage to an important part of our economy.’

Trevor Garlick, regional president for BP North Sea, said last night: ‘Given the challenges of operating in this maturing region and in toughening market conditions, we are taking steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust.’
