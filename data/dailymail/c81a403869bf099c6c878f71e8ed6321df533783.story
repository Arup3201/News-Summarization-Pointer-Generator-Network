A 63-year-old facial surgery addict with a 'grotesque’ appearance died soon after injecting heated beef fat into her face at home.

Janet Hardt, of Homewood, Illinois, died on Thursday at hospital after injecting the melted beef fat around her mouth and chin.

But she died of a bacterial infection suffered from weakened walls in her colon and the injections did not lead to her death, a coroner said.

Ms Hardt boiled the beef, extracted the fat and injected it into her face.

She had done this several times in the
 past and had also undergone a number of facial surgeries, a source told
 local news outlets.

Her face was ‘grotesque’, she had scarring from previous injections and she was ‘obsessed’ with self-injections, reported the Chicago Sun-Times.

But her face, which was said to be 
tight and not very wrinkled, soon felt singed and like it was burning, 
so she went to hospital, reported WLS-TV.

Hospital: Ms Hardt was pronounced dead at 6:25pm at Advocate South Suburban Hospital in Hazel Crest, Illiois, according to the medical examiner's office

She travelled the three miles to Advocate South Suburban Hospital in Hazel Crest, where doctors fought to save her.

But Ms Hardt was pronounced dead at 
the hospital on Thursday evening, the Cook County Medical Examiner's 
office told the Chicago Sun-Times.

She had previously undergone multiple 
facial surgeries.

‘An incident like this is very rare,’ 
Jeffrey Kenkel, president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic 
Surgery, told MailOnline.

He said his organisation hears of 
people injecting themselves with anything from baby oil to silicone, and
 many non-FDA approved products.

The rich divorcee, known as 'Cat Woman', completely changed her face with millions of dollars worth of cosmetic surgery. She is said to have had at least seven face-lifts.

The
 Korean woman injected cooking oil into her face when her supply of 
silicone ran out. Her face swelled so badly she was not even recognised 
by her own parents.

There is a risk of infection from 
bacteria and people can injure nerves and blood vessels, as well as 
suffering bad reactions from their own medical conditions.

‘Patients can obtain products over the internet and there are videos showing you how to inject yourself,’ he warned.

‘They don’t know how to inject the products under the right conditions.’

Requests for comment left with Homewood Police and Advocate South Suburban Hospital by MailOnline were not immediately returned.

'The very fact that someone would 
think (it was) acceptable astounds me,' Shannon Quante, of plastic 
surgery clinic CosMedic, told NBC Chicago.

Her death could have been due to contamination, Ms Quante added.
