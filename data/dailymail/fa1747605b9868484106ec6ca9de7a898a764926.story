Rohit Sharma revealed he felt so fresh after his record-breaking 264 against Sri Lanka he could have stayed at the crease for another 50 overs.

Sharma racked up the highest ever one-day international score on Thursday and became the first player to score two career double centuries in a 50-over match in the process.

Prior to the match, the 27-year-old had been out for almost three months due to finger and shoulder injuries. But, rather than causing him to be rusty, Sharma suggested his time away may have actually aided his longevity at the crease.

'The fact that I went on to play 50 overs, that was really pleasing to me because I've been working on it, to bat as long as possible. So finally to do that was really good.'

'After a few months' break, I'm not really tired, I was ready to bat another 50 overs,' he said.

'But yeah, jokes apart, I was determined and dedicated to getting a big one. Once I got to fifty, I knew that I had to convert, because it was a good batting wicket. 

'The scores here, even 300-350, are easily chaseable. We wanted to get a big score and that made me stay there as long as possible.'

Sharma's total came off 173 balls with 33 fours and nine sixes to help India reach 4004 for five in Kolkata.
