A World War II veteran who faced eviction because he smokes cigarettes in his building's breezeway rather than the designated smoking area has been allowed to continue living in the complex.

Andy Nowicki and his wife, who are both 90-years-old, were informed that they would have to move out of their Newington, Connecticut apartment over his smoking habit but the case caused an immediate backlash.

Now the Housing Authority in Newington has ruled that the Nowickis will be able to stay in their home after coming to a settlement with their landlords.

War hero: Andy Nowicki enjoys a cigarette in front of the apartment from which he and his wife faced eviction, but now they have struck a deal with administrators to allow them to stay

Habit: Nowicki started smoking while fighting the Nazis. He says he's tried to quit but can't

The agreement stipulates that the 
apartment complex must be made more handicap-accessible so that Mr 
Nowicki, who uses a motorized wheelchair, can smoke under an awning in 
the designated smoking area.

'I
think today common sense prevailed. This should have happened months 
ago. This guy is a true American hero,' said state senator Paul Doyle who 
represented Mr Nowicki's case free of charge.

Mr
Nowicki won a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts during the war, was a 
combat infantryman fighting the Nazis in Africa, Italy, France and 
Germany.

The Army is where 
he picked up his smoking habit 70 years ago, as Uncle Sam provided 
soldiers with free cigarettes during the war.

New Policy: The smoking restrictions were put in place at Cedar Village apartments in January 2012

His
daughter Janet had no idea where her parents would go if they are 
forced from their $714-a-month apartment as the couple lives on a small,
fixed income.

Additionally,
Mr. Nowicki's wife, Leona, is in the very late stages of Alzheimer's - 
most of the time, she barely even recognizes her husband of nearly 70 
years.

'Personally, I couldn't sleep at night evicting a 90-year-old war hero from government-subsidized housing,' Doyle said.

'It's
just totally incredible to me that we can't find an exception to the 
rules. I think common sense should prevail and let Mr. Nowicki live out 
his life because of what he did for all of us.'

A change had to be made no matter what, as Mr Nowicki's health was at risk- and not just from his smoking habit.

Compromise: State Senator Paul Doyle is acting as the Nowicki's attorney helped them reach a compromise

His family says that he broke two of his ribs two weeks ago when he was returning to his apartment from smoking.

Adding to that, his previous attempts at quitting have failed.

'Are you kidding? I got the best doctor in the world. He gave me gum. He gave me the patch,' Mr Nowicki said.

The
Housing Authority in charge of the complex eventually agreed, with 
their lawyer telling The Hartford Courant that in the end both parties 
were able to settle on the agreement.

'We were happy to accommodate him to make the apartment more handicapped accessible,' lawyer Elliot Lane told the paper.
