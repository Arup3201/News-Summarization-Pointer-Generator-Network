She usually avoids the public glare - instead focusing on family life with her husband, three children and high-flying legal career.

But Miriam Clegg has risked upstaging the Deputy Prime Minister this week at the Liberal Democrat conference - and she managed it again yesterday with a stunning outfit for her husband’s speech.

The wife of Nick Clegg, who goes by her maiden name of Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, wore a white knee-length ‘New York Dress’ by Scottish designer Henrietta Ludgate, which normally sells for £390.

Dress sense: Miriam Clegg has spent this week upstaging her husband Nick Clegg during the Liberal Democrat conference - and she managed it again with a stunning white outfit for the Deputy Prime Minister's speech

But the 44-year-old Spanish lawyer’s cropped-sleeve version by the luxury womenswear designer was made to order, so would have cost substantially more than its retail price.

In a subtle nod to her homeland, her dress, with sleeves to the elbow, was teamed with pointed orange heels from popular high street name and Spanish-owned clothing chain Zara.

The Scottish label's website describes an ‘ethos of supporting Scottish craftsmanship’ with fabrics sourced from within Britain and pieces produced locally.

It states: ‘When you buy a Henrietta Ludgate creation, you are not only investing in the British textile industry, but also supporting traditional skills and providing employment for local communities.’

Mr Clegg, wearing a dark suit and pink tie, sought out his wife after the keynote speech before the couple made their way out of the hall together through the cheering conference crowd in Brighton.

Delegates, journalists and photographers have seemed apparently more interested in the Spanish lovely than the Deputy Prime Minister's pronouncements on tax and spending this week.

He was left visibly uncomfortable on Monday - the day of his wedding anniversary - after Sky News host Eamonn Holmes ended an interview on live television by remarking on Mrs Clegg's appearance.

‘Congratulations on your long lasting marriage. May I just say you have a very attractive wife,’ Mr Holmes said as Mr Clegg squirmed, replying: 'I think she will be very flattered by that. I think so.'

Carrying on regardless Mr Holmes then said: 'I think he blushed at that,' and the Deputy Prime Minister tried to end the conversation by saying simply: 'Yes'.
