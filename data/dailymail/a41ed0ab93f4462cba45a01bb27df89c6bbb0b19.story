Today's international friendlies may often be humdrum affairs, with nothing resting on them other than club fans and managers desperate for their star players to avoid injury.

Yet at Highbury, 80 years ago on Friday, an encounter between England and Italy not only decided who could call themselves world champions but was so violent that it stretched the meaning of the word ‘friendly’ beyond its limit.

By the end, at least three players had suffered broken bones and moral outrage screamed off the pages of the British press. The Daily Mail even questioned whether international friendlies should be played at all.

How did one match come to spark such fierce debate? In 1934, England were not members of FIFA and hadn’t taken part in the first two World Cup tournaments. Italy had won the second of those, five months earlier in Rome, much to the delight of Benito Mussolini, who saw the triumph as a vindication of his fascist ideology.

To English minds, though, Italy’s victory did not make them the world’s leading team. After all, England had yet to be defeated on home soil (that would not happen until 1949, when Ireland triumphed 2-0 at Goodison Park). And, as this was the Italians’ first match since defeating Czechoslovakia to win the Jules Rimet trophy, the stage was set for a mouth-watering encounter billed as the ‘real World Cup final’.

Italy, coached by the meticulous Vittorio Pozzo, knew the stakes were high, with one of their journalists prophetically describing Highbury as a ‘theatre of international war’.

It would later be claimed that their players had been offered huge inducements to defeat England. Win bonuses of £150 a man, an Alfa Romeo each and exemption from military service were some of the carrots dangled before the Italian players as Mussolini eyed a victory of sporting and political significance.

England’s team did not feature a single player with more than 10 caps. The starting line-up was dominated by Arsenal, the undisputed leading English team of the day. Seven Gunners (Frank Moss, George Male, Eddie Hapgood, Wilf Copping, Ray Bowden, Ted Drake and Cliff Bastin) started for England — a record that still stands.

Hapgood, who had belted a clearance into the lap of a visibly irate Mussolini during a friendly against Italy in Rome 18 months earlier, was captain. Completing the XI were a young Stanley Matthews, winning his second cap, Everton’s Cliff Britton, Derby County’s Jack Barker and Eric Brook of Manchester City.

A crowd of 56,044 crammed into Highbury. Mussolini was in Switzerland and demanded regular updates from London.

Italy’s start was catastrophic. England raced into a 3-0 lead after 12 minutes, thanks to two goals from Brook — who had missed a penalty in the opening minute — and one from Drake.

Worse still for Italy, their midfield general Luis Monti suffered a broken foot in the second minute in a challenge by Drake. He stayed on until the 15th minute after which the Italians played with 10 men, as substitutes were not allowed at the time.

The loss of Monti lit the fuse, with the visitors believing Drake had deliberately injured the defender. Incensed, the Italians sought retribution and the challenges flew in — but later, Italy coach Pozzo admitted that Monti, in trying to turn quickly, had stubbed the toe of his boot in the ground.

‘The Italians had gone berserk and were kicking everybody and everything in sight,’ noted Hapgood in his autobiography. The numbers were temporarily evened up when Hapgood suffered a broken nose following an elbow to the face.

When he returned to the field, after a few quick stitches, an England victory seemed a certainty. But the Italians mounted a comeback, albeit accompanied by violence.

Shoulder-charging and two-footed challenges from both sides were rife but two classy goals from Giuseppe Meazza in four second-half minutes punctuated the chaos. England were suddenly clinging on and injuries were mounting. Brook had a broken arm, suffered in the first half, and Drake was nursing a swollen jaw, having been struck in the face. Bowden had an injured ankle.

One England player was able to rise above the carnage: Wilf Copping. Known as ‘The Iron Man’, Copping was a former miner whose match-day motto was ‘first man into a tackle never gets hurt’. The Yorkshireman formed a crucial part of the rearguard action, hurling himself into challenges in midfield.

‘Wilf Copping enjoyed himself that afternoon,’ joked Hapgood later. ‘For the first time in their lives the Italians were given a sample of real, honest shoulder-charging.’

Yet even a man down, the Italians were subjecting England to a relentless onslaught. Meazza, on a hat-trick, struck the bar and was also denied by Moss.

Then, at the death, the Italians fashioned a great opening but a team-mate chose not to square the ball to Meazza, who was unmarked. The Inter Milan legend, a winner of three Italian titles and two World Cups, would later cite the missed opportunity as the greatest regret of his life.

Italy’s chance had gone and England had their famous 3-2 victory. Incredibly, despite the violence, the teams went ahead with a banquet in the evening, attended by both sets of players with the walking wounded observing the pleasantries.

Hapgood, sporting his broken nose and feeling groggy, recalled locking eyes with his assailant, who smiled back at him before letting out a raucous laugh. ‘I’m glad I am a pretty even-tempered fellow or I would have gone across the table at him,’ said the Arsenal man. ‘But he wasn’t worth it.’

The Daily Mail match report the next day, by Frank Carruthers, was headlined ‘England beat Italy — but should these games be played?’

Far from wanting to hail a famous victory, he wrote: ‘From the point of view of football as I understand it, I hope to forget it.’

Carruthers, like many of his Fleet Street counterparts, claimed the differences between the styles of British and Continental teams meant international friendlies should be put on hold ‘until there is a better understanding of the methods which may and may not be employed.’

As for the Italians’ tackling, Carruthers lamented: ‘They are not greatly concerned with the ball.’

In Italy, the defeat was claimed as a moral victory and their players were hailed as ‘The Lions of Highbury.’

Italy would have to wait until 1973 for their first win over England.
