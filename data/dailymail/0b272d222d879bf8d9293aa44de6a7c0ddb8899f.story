Style icon David Beckham's numerous underwear campaigns have resulted in a huge boost in interest in men's pants ... and it's not just the girls saying that.

Men's intimates are revealing themselves to be a recession-busting item, with one major retailer noticing a 28 per cent increase in sales since the start of the year.

Gone are the days when a man's only 
choice was between boxers or briefs. Today the men's underwear, bodywear and sleepwear industry is big business, with high-fashion male 
celebrities like Beckham fronting multi-million pound campaigns.

Selfridges has likened the sales of 
men's 'bodywear' - underwear, sleepwear and socks - to the lipstick 
effect, the term coined for women buying small but luxurious items in 
times of recession.

Stars like David Beckham promoting their own underwear ranges means that sales of mens underwear have risen as much as 28 per cent

Beckham's latest range for H&M has been hugely successful, and sales everywhere are booming

Seeing highly toned successful men like Beckham and rugby star Thom Evans promoting their own ranges of under garments reinforces the idea that buying the brand in someway buys you a tiny slice of their lifestyle which is appealing to men in these tough times. 

Beckham's current range of boxers and briefs for high street brand H&M has been a massive success.

As well as designing the range the sports star is seen showing off his toned body and his
extensive body art in the latest 
advertisement for his H&M collection,  a short film directed by his friend Guy Ritchie.

Gone are the days of simple boxers or briefs for men, their underwear is now entering the realms of high fashion

The men's bodywear category has 
emerged as one of the strongest performers at the Selfridges store, to 
the extent that it is opening a 20 per cent larger bodywear department 
this week.

The
9,000 sq ft area will stock nearly 25,000 pairs of underwear, of which 
10,000 will be displayed on a curved wall 'set to be the largest of its 
kind in the world'.

Those
immune to the recession can choose from underwear made by Versace or 
Dior, which has a range of briefs at £55 a piece, or a silk dressing 
gown by Savile Row tailor Derek Rose for £915.

Those wanting to spend a little less will find pairs of Happy Socks for £8.

The
store said its best-selling styles were trunks, making up 46 per cent 
per cent of sales, followed by briefs (27 per cent) and boxers (13 per 
cent), with the most popular colours being black, white and red.

Guy Ritchie directed the most recent advert for David Beckham's H&M's bodywear range which see's him chasing after a car, leaping over fences

Underwear seems to be the luxury item men are willing to spend money on during the recession

Selfridges menswear buying manager 
Richard Sanderson said: 'Sales of men's underwear at Selfridges have 
been very healthy throughout 2012 and they have been even stronger since
the start of the year. With our new men's bodywear space we are 
forecasting weekly sales of nearly 3,000 pairs of underwear.

'Men
have become much more fashion-conscious in their choice of underwear 
and are looking for details and distinctive features such as contrasting
belts, mix of texture in the materials used, patterns and even devices 
to enhance their natural shape.'
