Jailed: Rapist Paul Clarke told one victim, 'No pain, no gain' during a ten-year campaign of abuse

A sadistic serial rapist who said 'no pain, no gain' to one of his victims as he attacked her has been jailed for 16 years.

Paul Clarke carried out a 'campaign of rape' over ten years from his home in a remote Devon village believing he would always be able to escape justice, Exeter Crown Court heard.

He insisted to his family that he was innocent - making his young daughters feel 'broken' when they discovered the truth about his crimes.

Clarke, 47, a divorced father of six, became aggressive when drunk and forced three women to take part in degrading sex acts against their will.

In one case he laughed off his victim's protests, telling her 'no pain, no gain'.

He was investigated on suspicion of rape in the early 2000s, but after he escaped prosecution he was apparently emboldened to carry out further assaults.

Clarke, from Chilsworthy in north Devon, told one of his victims: 'I have been accused of rape so I might as well get on and do it.'

After being arrested in 2011 and charged with 11 counts of rape, he continued to deny any wrongdoing, but was found guilty of all charges last month. At an earlier trial, he was also convicted of assaulting one victim.

Clarke's daughter Michaela, 20, said today that her father's lies had 'torn the family apart' and destroyed the lives of her and her younger sister.

She told MailOnline that she had believed her father, who was a 'hero' to her, until just two months before he was convicted.

'He's been an alcoholic all his life, but I never thought he was capable of this', Miss Clarke said. 'Me and Dad were really close - I looked at him as if he was a hero.

'He said he was innocent all along, and I always forgave him for his drinking.

'Why couldn't he be the person I always lay on the sofa and watched TV with? He completely changed and became a different person.'

While Miss Clarke, a cleaner who now lives in Cornwall, stood by her father until November last year and continued to share his home, other relatives spurned him - leading to a major breach in family relations.

'It's torn my family apart,' she told MailOnline. 'I don't have dealings with any of them any more. He's just torn us all to pieces.

'I want answers to why he did it, and why he couldn't stop his drinking.'

Some members of the family still refuse to believe that Clarke is guilty, and his daughter says she and her younger sister have been threatened by relatives over social media.

'It's broken her as well as broken me,' Miss Clarke said.

Sentencing Clarke to 16 years in prison, Recorder Mr Michael Bowes said: 'Each victim described you correctly as being a bullying and manipulative man.

'There were 11 offences of rape against three separate women and in my judgment, taken as a whole, comprised what can properly be categorised as a campaign of rape.

'One of your victims said that the more she struggled the more you seemed to enjoy it. That assault was very painful and must also have been disgusting.

'The degradation and humiliation the victims suffered almost beggars belief. Your violence has had a profound effect on all of your victims. It is quite plain you have no remorse whatsoever.'

Clarke, an unemployed ex-farmer, claimed that the women had colluded to invent false allegations against him and said he could not have had sex while drunk because alcohol made him impotent.

After the case, Detective Constable James Rees of Devon and Cornwall Police said said: 'We are extremely pleased with the guilty verdict and the sentence imposed today.

'The defendant's denial of these offences and taking his case to trial has caused the victims further distress in having to recount their ordeals in court.'
