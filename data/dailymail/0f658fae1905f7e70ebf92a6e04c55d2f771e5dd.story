It might not be a good idea to take on an opponent who is much bigger than you - but when you have the power and cunning of a lioness, size is irrelevant.

An incredible video has emerged of a lioness taking down a baby giraffe at the Shamwari Game Reserve in Grahamstown.

Although lions have a tendency to avoid tackling such large prey, the giraffe proves no match for the astonishing lightning fast agility of the lioness.

Scroll down for video

A lioness at the Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa is pictured leaping into the air and bringing down a giraffe

Two lionesses stand over the stricken giraffe who was ambushed while grazing with its mother

The lone lioness stalks a baby giraffe and its mother at the reserve using a bush as cover

Having waited patiently for the giraffe and its mother to finish grazing on a nearby tree, the lioness silently creeps towards her prey, ready to pounce

The clip begins with the lioness using a bush as cover as it watches the baby giraffe and its mother grazing from a distance.

The lion slowly begins to creep towards its prey using bushes and shrubs to stay hidden from the craning view of the giraffe.

She patiently sits in the long grass waiting for the giraffe to drop their guard and walk away from the trees.

As the giraffe finish their meal and begin to walk towards a clearing, the lioness makes her move.

As the giraffe begin to walk away from the bushes, the lion speeds up hoping to cut its prey off at the beginning of the clearing

With a powerful burst of speed, the lioness suddenly breaks into a sprint and races towards the giraffe

As the unsuspecting giraffe emerge from behind the trees, the lioness strikes and barely breaks stride before leaping high into the air

The mother giraffe is helpless as the lioness strikes out dragging its bigger prey to the ground

The pack of lions are pictured feasting on the giraffe after dark

She stalks around the tree hoping to cut the unsuspecting pair off as they saunter away breaking into a run as she gets closer.

As
the two giraffe emerge from the cover of the trees the lioness strikes 
effortless breaking into a powerful sprint and leaping in the air.

The lion twists and, claws first, manages to bring the baby giraffe down to the ground.

With
the mother left to helplessly look on, the stricken baby giraffe can 
still be seen breathing as it lays helplessly on the ground with its 
captor standing over it.

The clip ends after dark, when the pack of lions enjoy the fruits of the lionesses labours and feast on the catch.

Lions
in Africa tend to feast on wildebeest, zebras and buffalo. They are 
occasionally known to take down larger prey such as giraffes but it is a
relatively rare practice due to the threat of injury because of their 
size.
