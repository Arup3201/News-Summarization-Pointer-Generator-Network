An elderly couple had a lucky escape when their truck was struck by lightning as they drove through Alberta in Canada.

The dramatic moment their vehicle was turned into a fireball on Saturday afternoon was caught on surveillance video from a nearby business.

The force of the strike melted parts of Al and Betty Perry's truck and trapped them inside when the vehicle's electrical equipment failed.

In the footage, the couple's car is seen driving along a road next to power lines and under stormy skies.

Lightning suddenly strikes the truck, and a halo of flames can be seen engulfing the vehicle as it continues down the road.

As the lighting hit their Chevrolet, the airbags went off, the electrics malfunctioned - locking the windows and doors - and smoke started to fill the inside of the vehicle.

'It sounded like a sonic boom,' Mr Perry said, as he described how everything lit up around them.

'I turned my body and put my two feet up
 and tried to kick the window out. I don’t know how many 
times I tried,' Mr Perry told WPTV.

Mr Perry said he feared their truck would become a 'coffin' and added that he was concerned for his wife because she was recovering from a stroke.

Fortunately, a police officer who had been driving behind them was able to break into the vehicle and help the couple to safety.

While the couple, who celebrated their 47th wedding anniversary just days after the strike, were given a clean bill of health by doctors, their truck didn't fare so well.

All of the air bags inside it had gone off, and the strike and flames had melted sections of the vehicle.

Two deep potholes also mark the road at the point where the lightning made contact.
