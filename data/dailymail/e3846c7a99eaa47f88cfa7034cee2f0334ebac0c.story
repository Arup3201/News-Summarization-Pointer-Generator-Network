Up to 170million children in China will undergo drug tests, after it was revealed hundreds of pupils were secretly being given antiviral medication by their schools.

China's education ministry has ordered a nationwide investigation into the issue after a demonstration by parents of kindergarteners who were given the drugs.

The probe comes a week after an angry protest by parents whose children were allegedly given moroxydine hydrochloride - a drug invented in the 1950s to halt the spread of flu - in Xi'an city.

Some children suffered stomach pain, dizziness and other symptoms but authorities say it is unclear whether it was linked to the drug.

Police in Xi'an said two kindergartens gave children the medication to improve attendance rates and boost their incomes.

Detectives said they have detained suspects and are determining how extensively the medication was used. A kindergarten in the city of Jilin also was found to be giving the drug to students.

Authorities shut down a Yichang kindergarten after its president admitted giving pupils an over-the-counter anti-fever drug and vitamins to boost immunity and attendance, Xinhua News Agency said.

Parents only found out about the secret drugs at a kindergarten in Xi’an earlier this month when one boy told his mother that he had been ‘taking medicine’ to ensure he would ‘never get sick again’.

The scandals in China have raised public concerns over the safety and health of schoolchildren at kindergartens, where fees are paid only for the days they attend.

Chinese officials said they would conduct a ‘thorough, one-by-one’ inspection of every kindergarten, primary school and middle school in the country, reported the Daily Telegraph.

The Government said it would ‘investigate whether kindergartens are illegally organising the medication of groups of infants’ - and report back by April 15.
