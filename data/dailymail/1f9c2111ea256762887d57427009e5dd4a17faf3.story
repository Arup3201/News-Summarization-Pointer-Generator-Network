A patent has been approved that could see Google tracking, and making money from, the eye movements of its Google Glass owners.

The Gaze Tracking System patent shows the device tracking where the wearer looks, how long they look at an item, and even how much their pupils dilate. 

Information about where the user is looking could then be sent to Google's servers where an image scanning algorithm would identify what they are looking at, create a log of everything they've viewed, and potentially use this information to serve adverts.

A patent has been approved that could see Google tracking the eye movements of its Google Glass owners. It could potentially track how long a user looks at an item as well as pupil dilation. Images would then be sent to a server and kept in a viewing history before being used to show adverts on the device's screen, pictured

Consumers might need to buy bigger 
and faster mobile price plans in order to feed data-hungry devices like 
Google Glass, according to experts.

American
 technology guru Brian Fung predicts wearable devices like Google Glass 
will be expensive for consumers as the hardware will probably not be 
subsidised by wireless carriers and users will have to upgrade their 
data plans.

It is believed the device will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity.

The patent reads: 'Eye tracking systems use cameras to measure eye movement/position to determine the point of gaze (i.e., where you are looking).

'Eye trackers have been used in human computer interaction systems, psychology, and other research field endeavors.

'There are a number of techniques to measure eye movement including video images from which eye position can be determined.

'To date, eye tracking systems have mostly been limited to research endeavors because of the intrusiveness, high cost, and reliability of these systems.

'A technique and system that can provide a reliable, low cost, and unobtrusive, eye tracking system could have a variety of useful everyday applications.'

Tracking sensors would be attached to the small screen that sits above the wearer's right eye.

The camera on the right arm of the device could be used to record the adverts and where the wearer gazes.

Google could then potentially show adverts on the built-in screen.

For example, if someone gazes at a sandwich being eaten by another person, Google could show adverts for nearby restaurants or cafes.

Google could also measure how long 
people gaze at traditional adverts such as billboards, magazines and 
newspapers and send viewing figures to advertisers.

It could also use this method to create a log of products that the wearer likes in order to make the on-screen adverts more personalised.

Tracking sensors would be attached to the small screen that sits above the wearer's eye, on the left-hand side of this image, to measure position of the eye and pupil dilation. The camera on the right arm could then capture what the wearer is looking at

As explained in the patent: 'Under a pay per gaze 
advertising scheme, advertisers are charged based upon whether a user 
actually viewed their advertisement.

'Pay per gaze advertising need not 
be limited to on-line advertisements, but rather can be extended to 
conventional advertisement media including billboards, magazines, 
newspapers, and other forms of conventional print media.'

The patent does continue that the feature could be opted out of and that users would have control over what information is collected.

It also details that any personal data would be removed before information is sent to advertisers.

Commenting on the news, Nancy Owano from Phys.org said: 'Debate at this stage is premature. The patent, for one, filed in 2011, never mentions Google Glass, only with reference to a head-mounted gaze tracking device.

'Most important, this is a patent, not a product announcement. Patents at times do develop into real products and services but others do not. Time will tell if this patent evolves into advertising's new relationships with Google Glass.'
