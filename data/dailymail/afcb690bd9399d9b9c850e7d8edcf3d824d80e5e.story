A group of suspected illegal immigrants have been arrested after arriving into Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry which was carrying a dozen luxury jet skis worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The stowaways, who are aged 33 and 22 and are believed to be Albanian nationals, hid in the back of the truck containing 12 jet skis worth £15,000 each as it made its way from Ibiza to the UK.

It is understood the three men hid in the back of the 44ft lorry after climbing into it during the ferry crossing from Spain to Portsmouth Harbour.

Three illegal immigrants have been found on board a lorry carrying jet skis from Ibiza to the UK

Police were called to Watercraft World in Fareham, Hampshire, after workers spotted the men in the lorry as they unloaded the luxury jet skis. It is thought they climbed onto the lorry during the ferry crossing from Spain

Staff at Watercraft World in Fareham, Hampshire, only discovered the men, who were in good health, as they began unloading the luxury jet skis at the depot on Friday.

They alerted police who arrived soon after in three police cars and two vans to take the men away. 

Nigel Kershaw, who runs Watercraft World, said the men carried Albanian passports, driving licences and £2,000 in cash.

He said: 'At first I thought it was one of our guys and then another head appeared and we panicked.

'All we could do was surround the vehicle and tell them to stay where they were until the police arrived.

'I think everyone here is a bit shocked. It's one of those situations you see on the news as you see what's going on in Calais and other places.

'It doesn't seem real until a day like this and it's a big wake-up call for us all.

'I felt desperately sorry for the lorry drivers. With everything going on on the continent they are so aware of the issues.

'When they arrived in Spain from Ibiza they drove straight to Bilbao, not even stopping for coffee, so there was never any chance of having people climb in.'

He also urged authorities to tighten up controls, adding: 'I know they are up against it and immigration is on a huge scale but the whole thing needs looking at.'

The jet skis - all privately owned - were being transported from Ibiza where they were being used by riders at the Jet Bou Ibiza water sports festival.

The watercraft arrived in Bilbao following a 400-mile overland trip from Valencia where they had travelled from the island by another boat.

It is thought the men managed to gain access to the back of the lorry from another vehicle on the way over from Spain and had been travelling for up to three days.

Paul Hughes, director of festival organisers Xtreme Action, which organised the shipment of the jet skis, said: 'I don't know why they weren't picked up but they should have more cameras on lorries going through.'

He stressed the watercraft were undamaged during the incident and said he was working to book more secure trailers for next year's trip.

A Portsmouth Harbour spokesman refused to comment and said the UK Border Force is responsible for checking vehicles entering the port.

A UK Border Force spokesman said: 'We work closely with the police to tackle illegal immigration and continue to strengthen the security of our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.'

The discovery comes just days after UK Border Force officials started tightening controls on vessels sailing from West Africa amid the Ebola crisis. 

Police were called to the M20 in Kent after four suspected  illegal immigrants were seen sitting on top of a lorry

The men found on the M20 in Kent were detained by police before being handed over to immigration authorities

It is the latest in a string of similar incidents, where suspected illegal immigrants have tried to gain access to Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry.

Yesterday, four men suspected of being illegal immigrants were detained after reportedly hanging on to the top of a lorry as it drove along the London-bound carriageway of the M20 in Kent.  

It is understood the driver pulled over after seeing an arm hanging down from the roof of his lorry as he drove along the motorway.

Police were notified and the lorry parked up on the hard shoulder to await their arrival.

Last month, 13 suspected illegal immigrants, believed to be from Ethiopia, were detained after being spotted running from the back of a lorry on between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25. 

And just four days earlier, a man was arrested for alleged 'facilitation offences' after 24 Eritrean nationals were discovered in the rear of an HGV in Whitfield, near Dover, Kent.

The latest discovery comes just days after riot police were called to the French port of Calais as more than 400 immigrants tried to storm lorries bound for the UK.

French police used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd but chiefs admitted some illegal immigrants may have got onto lorries during the disturbance.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'We work closely with the police to tackle illegal immigration and continue to strengthen the security of our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.

'If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.

'If they are just seeking to evade immigration control they need to know that they are risking their lives and that they will get caught.

'The new Immigration Act makes it harder for people to live in the UK illegally.

'It makes it harder for illegal immigrants to abuse our benefits and public services, and makes it easier for us to remove them by reducing the number of appeals.'
