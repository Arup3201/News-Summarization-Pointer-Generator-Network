The former son-in-law of late actor John Cassavetes allegedly kidnapped and raped a teenager in his remote trailer.

Buck Wylde Murphy, 49, who was formerly married to Cassavetes' daughter, actress-writer Alexandra 'Xan', was arrested last week after he was discovered holding a 16-year-old girl captive at his trailer in the Californian desert.

The 49-year-old allegedly lured the girl, from Staten Island, New York, to San Bernardino County by pretending he was a 19-year-old boy during online chats.

Buck Wylde Murphy, 49, was arrested last week after allegedly luring a 16-year-old to a remote part of San Bernardino County, California (pictured), holding her captive in a trailer and raping her 

He sent her a recording of a song which, when she opened, contained a virus that allowed him to access her personal information.

Murphy then allegedly threatened to kill her family unless she flew to meet him. She went to California on February 22, leading her mother to get in touch with police. 

Police were unable to help so the woman got in touch with a private investigator who managed to track down the suspect.

The girl was held at the trailer for five days and sexually assaulted, according to authorities. 

Detectives from the Rancho Cucamonga Police Department initiated an investigation into a teenaged Staten Island runaway and determined she had been in contact with Murphy since she arrived in California

The alleged victim's mother told The New York Post: 'I was hoping for the best, but when her phone was turned off and I couldn't get a hold of her, I was afraid of the worst.'

Finally detectives from the Rancho Cucamonga Police Department initiated an investigation into the girl, whom it was believed had traveled to California. 

Detectives from the Human Trafficking Detail and Apple Valley Police Department helped and at approximately 9:10 p.m., on February 26th, detectives located the 16-year old and Murphy in his RV at the Horseman’s Center in Apple Valley.

Authorities then determined that Murphy had lured the juvenile to California and arranged for her travel. 

Once in California, the victim was held against her will by threat of force, and sexually assaulted by Murphy over the course of several days.

Murphy was arrested and booked into the High Desert Detention Center for the  crimes and is being held on $1,000,000. bail.

Detectives are concerned there may be other victims.

His ex-wife Alexandra Cassavetes is the daughter of John Cassavetes and actress Gena Rowlands.

John Cassavetes starred in movies including The Dirty Dozen and Rosemary’s Baby.
