North Korea has branded the U.S. 'a graveyard of human rights', as it criticised the nation in the wake of the Missouri riots following the shooting of an unarmed black teenager.

China, Iran and Russia have previously criticised America   following the shooting in the town of Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, and the subsequent crackdown on protesters.

North Korea, regularly condemned by Washington and others over allegations of gross human rights abuses, has now voiced its criticism of the U.S., saying it should 'mind its own business' rather than interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

A spokesman from North Korea's foreign ministry was quoted by the state-run news agency KCNA as saying the U.S. 'is indeed a country wantonly violating human rights where people are subject to discrimination and humiliation due to their race, and are in constant fear that they may get shot at any moment.'

The spokesman said: 'It should not seek solutions to its problems in suppressing demonstrators, but bring to light the real picture of the American society, a graveyard of human rights, and have a correct understanding of what genuine human rights are like and how they should be guaranteed.' 

The spokesman went on to say: 'The U.S. had better... mind its own business, instead of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.'

North Korea is estimated to have up to 120,000 political prisoners, while those caught attempting to leave the country are regularly sent to jail or face execution, according to AFP.

In February, a UN inquiry into North Korea's human rights record published its findings and detailed a wide range of systemic abuses including murder, enslavement and torture.

The commission concluded that many of the violations constituted crimes against humanity and suggested they could be placed before the International Criminal Court.

The report likened North Korea's regime to Nazism and called for the International Criminal Court to close political prison camps.

The use of systematic torture, starvation, and killings is akin to punishments ordered under Adolf Hitler, the report stated.

'The gravity, scale and nature of these violations revealed a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,' it said.

However, North Korea rejected the report as a 'sheer fabrication' invented by the United States and its allies.

Earlier this month it was reported that North Korea was to publish its own report saying its human rights record is 'bright and rosy'

The North's Association for Human Rights Studies said the report would counter the 'lies and fabrications' made by unspecified 'hostile forces' about the rights situation in the isolated state.

The shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by a white police officer has focused global attention on the state of race relations in the U.S. and has drawn criticisms from a number of other nations.

According to AFP, state media in China said that 'even in a country that has for years tried to play the role of an international human rights judge and defender, there is still much room for improvement'.

Egypt meanwhile, where at least 1,400 people have been killed in clashes with security forces since July last year, has said police in the U.S. used 'excessive' force when dealing with protests in Ferguson following the shooting. 

The August 9 shooting sparked two weeks of demonstrations, some with violent clashes and scores of arrests, in which protesters demanded Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson be charged in Brown's death. Demonstrations have been more subdued for days.

On Tuesday, more than 100 people marched a few blocks from St. Louis city hall to the federal court building, chanting 'fired up, fed up, time that we stand up.'

The protesters, who called for Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.
