The best nature photography in the past decade has captured the wonderful world of Australian wildlife from sly seals to voracious snakes.

These images have been compiled in the Australian Geographic's, Wild Australasia: Celebrating 10 years of the ANZANG Photo Competition, which showcases animals caught in the act and how their unusual and everyday rituals make for fascinating photography.

In 2011, Ofer Levy photographed the drinking behaviour of a grey-headed flying fox, swooping low and skimming the water with their bellies and then licking their wet fur as they fly off. 

In 2012 it was the hunter and the hunted. St John Pound captured an echidna foraging for ants in the Narawntapu National Park, in Tasmania. 

While in 2013 a beautiful black and white image of the black-winged stilts in their courtship dance captured in Charleville, Queensland by Dan Giselsson.

Grey-headed flying-fox drinking behaviour. They swoop low, skimming the water with their belly. They then lick their wet fur as they fly and continue licking when perched nearby. Such behaviour usually occurs at dusk and night but when the temperature reaches 35°C and above, they will also drink during the day

Survival of the fittest! It was an overcast, wet and miserable morning as photographer Trevor Penfold crawled commando-style across the wet beach on Stewart Island, off the southern tip of the South Island of New Zealand to capture two oystercatcher chicks (family Haematopodidae) battle endlessly, neither one wanting to give in to the other

The beautiful courtship dance of black-winged stilts captured in Charleville, Queensland, began with the female stilt (Himantopus himantopus), on the right, clearing the little sand mound by picking up and tossing away any extraneous sticks. She then stooped forward, inclining her whole body, which immediately attracted the male. The male circled the female as she slowly and gracefully spun around on the spot.

When fruit of silkwood

 flowers open, they display unsubtle yet harmonious colours. These colours attract fruit-eating birds which then disperse the seeds. Photographed at Cape Tribulation, far north Queensland

The small fruiting bodies of bird's nest fungi (Crucibulum sp.) are completely closed when first formed. Then the top crumbles away, leaving a cup containing spore-bearing tissues called peridioles. When raindrops land in the cup, the peridioles are propelled into the air, dispersing the spores. Photographed in East Harbour Regional Park, Wellington, New Zealand. Eric Burger, 2009

The green tree python (Morelia viridis) (pictured left) is restricted to the rainforests of the Iron and McIlwraith ranges in far north Queensland.

Rosie (pictured) is an adult tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) who was found with her head stuck in a swimming pool gate. Rescued and cared for by wildlife-rescue volunteers from Sydney Wildlife and WIRES, she was successfully rehabilitated and released soon afterwards.

Little egret grabs little fish as the sun set over Chilli Beach, Cape York, Queensland, this little egret (Egretta garzetta) was hunting small fish trapped in the tidal pools on the sand flats. It was running and jumping after its prey in an almost feverish excitement, knowing that there wasn't much light left.

This macro photo of a mosquito (family Culicidae) was taken in a small rockpool in my garden in Gooseberry Hill, Western Australia.

Fungi in the mist.  Each morning for a fortnight, a cluster of fungi would erupt out of a pile of woodchips in Noosa Botanic Gardens on Lake MacDonald at the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, but wither up and be gone a few hours after sunrise.
