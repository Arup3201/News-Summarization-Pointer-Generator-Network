They are usually thought of as shy and elusive animals, but now herds of deer have been seen wandering the city.

The urban herd of fallow deer, thought to have strayed from Epping Forest, have been photographed roaming east London streets at night, nosing into people’s gardens and trotting past cars.

British photographer Sam Hobson, 34, spent hours hiding in the darkness waiting for the perfect shot.

Fallow deer have been spotted crossing residential streets in east London, swapping the woodland for the urban jungle

Deer are usually thought of as shy and elusive, but this brave group seem at home on the mean streets of London

Mr Hobson, 34, said: 'Wild animals often make terrible models, and it takes a lot of patience and luck to get the compositions you want, but fortunately deer are great subjects for nocturnal photography'

He said: ‘It’s not unusual to see deer in city parks, but in this instance, truly wild deer are creeping out of the woods and into residential parts of east London.

‘I think most of the people waiting for the bus to work in the morning are totally unaware that wild deer may have been feeding around their feet just hours before.

‘Wild animals often make terrible models, and it takes a lot of patience and luck to get the compositions you want, but fortunately deer are great subjects for nocturnal photography.

‘Being quite timid, they move slowly and often pause stock-still to listen and look for danger, allowing for the long exposures which create the atmosphere in these pictures.’

Animal charities have had thousands of calls to rescue deer from urban areas, including schools, car parks, and even swimming pools in recent years

An RSPCA spokesman said deer will not cause a nuisance by going through your bins but they might develop a taste for the greenery in your front garden

The RSPCA spokesman said: Fallow deer are like most other deer they 
are bold enough to enter urban environments but they're still very 
nervous creatures, and will run away if someone approaches them'

Animal charities have had thousands of calls to rescue deer from urban environments such as schools, car parks, and even swimming pools in recent years, but say unless they are in danger, the animals are usually best left alone.

A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: ‘These creatures aren’t really urban “pests” in the conventional sense, and they won’t do things like go through rubbish bins.

‘Deer will definitely spoil people’s gardens and eat plants and trees though, but in urban areas, they’re more likely to just be passing through.

‘Fallow deer are like most other deer – they are bold enough to enter urban environments but they’re still very nervous creatures, and will run away if someone approaches them.’

All six deer species in Britain are increasing, and while fallow deer only increased by 1.8 per cent [in 2011], muntjac are increasing by 8.2 per cent a year, followed by sika (5.3 per cent), roe deer (2.3 per cent), Chinese water deer  (2 per cent), and red deer  at 0.3 per cent.
