Frank Lampard has no regrets over delaying his move to New York City FC – but has already pencilled in the date when he faces Steven Gerrard for the first time.

The Manchester City midfielder was expected to join the club's sister outfit for their maiden MLS season which kicked off earlier this month.

But in a controversial move which angered many of the new franchise's supporters, he extended his stay at the Etihad Stadium to the end of the season as Manuel Pellegrini's men attempt to retain their Premier League title.

Lampard's decision has been questioned after starting only two games for City in 2015

With Lampard's former club Chelsea now six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand, and having started just two matches since the turn of the year, some have questioned the logic behind the decision.

But the veteran midfielder, who won 11 trophies in a glittering 13 years at Stamford Bridge, has no such thoughts.

'I’m very fortunate,' he said.

'This part of my career, coming to City, was something I never saw coming and when I look back and think, blimey, at 36 I got asked to come to the champions and a club with this pedigree of player here.

'I’m delighted that happened as it has done and I’m delighted with the future I’ ve got and the opportunity to go on and play in New York and individually try to help there, but also be part of a new football club in one of the greatest cities in the world.'

Former England team-mate Steven Gerrard will also head across the Atlantic at the end of the season to join rivals LA Galaxy.

And Lampard is relishing the prospect of facing his old pal - when asked when the match takes place he was quick to answer.

'August 23,' he said without hesitation.

'It’s at their place. It’s the day after my daughter’s birthday so I should know!'

Lampard believes Liverpool legend Gerrard, 34, has made the right call to follow him to the US after 17 years in the first team at Anfield.

'I’m pleased for Stevie,' he said.

'I think it’s a very good move for him. What more can he do at Liverpool? 'He’s had a fantastic career.'

Lampard added that the pair, who retired from international duty a month apart last year, became close during their time with the Three Lions.

'We get on very well, particularly in our latter years, as captain and vice-captain of England,' he explained.

'I’ve a huge amount of respect for him and look forward to getting up against him out there.'

Lampard believes it is the right moment to go for Gerrard, who was sent off 38 seconds after coming off the bench in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday.

'I think only individuals know the right time for them,' he said.

'I wasn’t sure about my time as a Chelsea player. The decision got made for me. When the decision is not made for you, and you have to make it yourself then it’ s more difficult maybe. Only he knows that and I think at the minute I would say yes because what more can he do? If not their greatest player he will be right up there with the greatest players ever.'
