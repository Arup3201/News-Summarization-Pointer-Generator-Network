Brendan Rodgers has given has shown his support for controversial plans to introduce Premier League B teams into the Football League.

The Liverpool manager has given his backing to FA chairman Greg Dyke's idea to introduce a new 'League Three' in a bid to improve young English players.

Speaking to the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast Show on talkSPORT, Rodgers said: 'It is something I have thought for years should happen. I am a big advocate of it.

Support: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has given his backing to the FA's controversial 'B team' plans

'I have worked in development for nearly 15 years and there is a huge investment put into young players in this country and there’s a huge investment put into coaching.

'We are talking over £300million in coaching for young players to come through and yet we look at the numbers and the stats and they will tell you there is only 30 per cent of young players getting the opportunity [to play] in what is the most competitive league in the world.

'We have to find a way to give them the opportunities because as much as we have done with the fixture scheduling of Under-21s, it doesn’t bring the competitive nature that is required for you as a manager to assess a young player.

While Rodgers is aware many football supporters oppose the plans he insists change is needed.

'People will talk about the tradition of the game here in this country but one of the things that’s most constant is change and you have to look at ways in which you can be better and give young players a chance,' said the Reds boss.

'I think the B league, however it is formed, is something that is very important to give young players that competitive football.'

Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood was also in favour of Dyke's controversial proposal.

He said: ‘It’s the way forward. Other countries have shown that. If we’re going to try to improve the number of English players they have to be exposed to competitive league football sooner rather than later.’
