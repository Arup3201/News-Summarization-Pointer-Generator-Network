Hillary Clinton was given a raft of advice on how to soften the then first lady's stern schoolmarm images, according to documents buried in a 4,000 page dump of files released Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas.

The previously secret paperwork shows Mrs Clinton's press secretary, Lisa Caputo, urging her in August 1995 to consider an appearance on the sitcom Home Improvement, a wedding anniversary photo spread for People magazine and a sit-down interview – with philandering husband Bill – across from Barbara Walters.

'This might be a nice time peg to have the President and Hillary do a special joint interview with Barbara Walters,' Caputo believed.

'If we did an interview around the anniversary time peg, it would not appear to be political.'

Those were the days: Hillary Clinton's advisers wanted her to spearhead a love-fest media tour including special attention to the anniversary of her marriage to her philandering husband

Clinton's press secretary told her in 1995 -- the era of Netscape and dial-up AOL -- to prepare to reach the public 'through Internet'

Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, floated a series of ideas designed to get positive press surrounding her wedding anniversary -- making it seem less political

Also on the plan was an interview with a women's magazine like Family Circle. 'Hillary should own the women's media,' Caputo wrote.

And she urged the future senator and secretary of state to give People 
magazine an exclusive photo collection from throughout the Clintons' 
marriage, including pictures snapped at 'a big party' held in honor of 
the anniversary.

'I know this may sound like a wild idea, but I think it is an interesting one to discuss,' Caputo wrote of the prospect of lining up the president's wife opposite comedian Tim Allen on ABC's then-hit show Home Improvement.

'The outreach would be enormous and it would present Hillary in a very likeable light I believe. Although I have some concerns that it diminishes the role of First Lady by going on a tv sitcom, it is probably worth weighing it against what we believe we might be able to gain by such an appearance politically and image-wise.'

Caputo's promotion of early online communications vehicles stands out, too.

'Hillary could speak to young women through Internet,' she wrote, dropping the word 'the.'

'I think Hillary would have fun with this, and I believe it would not be too difficult to organize.'

The sudden publication of a portion of 33,000 pages of material came after reporters inquired why they weren't released in January 2013, at the end of a 12-year blackout period designed to protect outgoing presidents during their transition to private life.

But the Obama White House doesn't appear interested in protecting Clinton's legacy, or the electoral viability of HIllary Clinton, choosing not to block the release of a single page.

Awkward: Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald wrote in 1999 that she had to be prepared to answer reporters' questions about whether she had ever used drugs

Then-first lady Hillary Clinton is inextricably connected to her husband Bill's presidency, taking heat for her involvement in some of the scandals that put asterisks on his political achievements

Hillary's press secretary wanted her to appear on a sitcom opposite comedian Tim Allen

Judicial Watch, a right-leaning watchdog group that has demanded documents such as these through FOIA lawsuits for years, claimed victory on Friday.

'These documents are a long-time coming,' said the organization's president, Tom Fitton.

'It took critical news stories and Judicial Watch lawsuits (and the threat of Judicial Watch lawsuits) to extract this latest batch of documents after an inexcusable delay. The Clinton administration was rife with secrecy and corruption, so any new bits of information may be important.  We’ve been battling for some of this material for nearly a decade.'

Mrs.
 Clinton, who is already the Democrats' 2016 presidential front-runner, 
figures prominently in much of the material. She spearheaded an 
ill-fated effort in 1993 and 1994 to reorganize the nation's health care
 system, an unusually policy-heavy role for the wife of a U.S. 
president.

And as she prepared in 1999 to run for U.S. Senate in New York, adviser Mandy Grunwald wrote in a memo that she needed to be humorous and relaxed while answering questions at public events.

Look for opportunities for humor,' she wrote. 'It's important that people see more sides of you, and they often see you only in very stern situations.'

Grunwald also cautioned  Clinton – using quote marks – to "be careful to 'be real'".'

It's all in there: Jeff Shesol, a Bill Clinton speechwriter, was a serious doodler, proving that boring strategy meetings can even happen in the Oval Office

The Clinton Library put out boxes of previously unseen materials on Friday, but more reporters found the documents online

As she gears up 
for what nearly everyone in Washington expects will be a brutal 2016 
election, her involvement in 'Hillarycare' is making the rounds once 
again.

Hillary's scandal-plagued time in the White House will likely make repeated appearance in 2016 campaign ads and presidential debates.

She was embroiled in a series of controversies while living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, including a scandal involving the hiring of Craig Livingstone, a former nightclub bouncer and 'advance' man for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign as director of the White House Office of Personnel Security.

That office, a House panel learned in 1996, failed to perform background checks on most White House workers, and improperly obtained FBI files covering many appointees and employees of the  Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations.

Hillary Clinton was also the driving force behind the first national scandal attached to her husband's presidency, the so-called 'travelgate' fiasco.

In 1996 a memo surfaced publicly that identified her as the main instigator in a plan to dismiss the entire staff of the White House Travel Office – civil servants who served both Democratic and Republican administrations – and replace them with friends of the Clintons.

While Mrs. Clinton manicured her image as a supportive wife during the 1990s, her direct involvement in a series of scandals -- and her hands-on management of the ill-fated "Hillarycare" program -- painted a picture of a far more ambitious woman

Billy Dale, the office's director at 
the time, had served there since 1961. He was later acquitted of charges
 that he embezzled from travel funds, successfully arguing that he had 
set aside money in her personal for gratuities and other off-books 
expenses required when the president travels.

An Obama administration official has told Politico that
 the White House 'cleared a significant number of P2/P5 Clinton 
documents ... roughly 25,000 pages,' referring to the transparency 
exceptions outlined in sections P2 and P5 of the Presidential Records 
Act.

'There have been no executive privilege assertions on Clinton materials to date,' said the aide.

The Presidential Records Act spells out the rules covering memos and other communications produced inside the Executive Office of the President, setting a 12-year period after which those records are subject to the same rules as other government papers under the Freedom Of Information Act.

But Congress created an exception and decided the the White House could cite executive privilege to block any document from public view after the 12 years have expired.

Bill and Hillary in their shaggier hippie days -- did she use drugs? Adviser Many Grunwald was worried it might come up when she ran for the U.S. Senate in New York

The fact that the administration has chosen to leave everything in plain view could spell trouble for Hillary Clinton, who fought an often brutal 2008 presidential primary campaign against Obama before accepting the secretary of state role as a consolation prize in 2009.

Clinton-bashers on both her right and left flanks will look to Friday's release for ammunition to use in both the 2016 primary season and the general election – if she should choose to run, and if she manages to maintain her heir-apparent status in the Democratic Party.

And the new records could drive down public perceptions of her in the all-important 'integrity' category.

A Siena Polling Institute survey of historians this year found that although she ranked sixth among former first ladies overall, but a dismal 21st out of 39 for honesty and integrity.

'Trustworthiness was never the Clintons' long suit,' University of Virginia Center for Politics Director Larry Sabato told MailOnline last week.

Yet some Republicans, including moderate Senator John McCain, see Hillary's ascendency to the White House as inevitable if she chooses to grab the brass ring.

'As much as I hate to admit it ... right now, if the election were tomorrow, Hillary Clinton would most likely be the president of the United States,' McCain told CNN's Piers Morgan last week.

Yesterday during a breakfast event in Washington, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a much-talked-about GOP presidential hopeful aligned with tea party conservatives, said Mrs. Clinton presided over an Obama administration foreign policy that has been an absolute debacle … alienating allies and cozying up to enemies.'

She has been 'consistently wrong on domestic policy and foreign policy,' Cruz said.

The Clinton Library in Arkansas released more than 4,000 pages of documents from the 1993-2001 Bill Clinton White House, including a series of bombshell revelations.
