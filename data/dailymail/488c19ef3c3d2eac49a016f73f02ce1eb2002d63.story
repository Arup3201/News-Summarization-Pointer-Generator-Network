Ready: Ghanain Cardinal Turkson says he is willing to serve as Pope 'if it is the will of God'

The first shot in the battle to succeed Benedict XVI was fired by an African candidate for the Papacy yesterday.

Cardinal Peter Turkson said ‘young churches’ of Africa and Asia were ready to provide worldwide leadership for Roman Catholicism.

The intervention came just 24 hours after Benedict’s surprise retirement announcement, and signalled an open struggle for the succession between the European establishment  and the fast-growing Catholic churches of the southern hemisphere.

Cardinal Turkson, a 64-year-old Ghanaian, said he was willing to serve as Pope himself ‘if it is the will of God’.

The Cardinal, who has headed the Vatican office on international peace and justice for the past four years, said that African and Asian churches have produced ‘mature clergymen and prelates that are capable of exercising leadership also of this world institution’.

He said that although the churches of  the south had been ‘growing exponentially’ under European Popes, a Pope from the south ‘would go a long way to strengthen them in their resolve’.

Cardinal Turkson’s comments open up a rivalry between the European favourites to succeed Benedict and candidates from Africa, Asia and Latin American, whose churches are perceived as strong and growing at a time when Catholics are under pressure in their historic strongholds.

Liberal complaints about gay rights and the status of women have combined with sex abuse scandals to put a question mark over loyalty to the church and its leadership in Europe and America.

Congregations are also seen to be falling as Catholics lose faith in much of Europe and America.

The Ghanaian cardinal, who would be the first ever black Pope if elected by next month’s conclave, said: ‘I think in a way the church is always and has forever been ready for a non-European Pope.’

Cardinal Turkson added that it was vital for the church to restore its authority in the wake of sex scandals. ‘Being the Pope of the church is not going to be an easy task,’ he said.

‘We need to repair our credibility. Our pastors need to be believed in again and recognised and taken seriously.

‘If we say we are celibate clergy, we need to live faithfully to that celibacy. There is one thing we cannot compromise on and that is our credibility.’

Cardinal Francis Arinze from eastern Nigeria has also been linked to the highest office in the faith.

The election of a black pope could be controversial in parts of Eastern Europe where 
racism remains a problem.

Two other contenders, Cardinal Odilo Scherer, Archbishop of San Paolo, 
and the French-Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, would also be a break 
with the tradition of electing only European popes.

After the long reign of a Polish pope – John Paul II – and a German 
pope, the Italian Catholic church will put a lot of pressure on 
cardinals to support an Italian for the papacy.

Among its favourites are
 Cardinal Angelo Scola, Archbishop of Milan, and Cardinal Angelo 
Bagnasco, Archbishop of Genoa.

Benedict’s resignation shocked churchgoers and left the senior ranks of the church in turmoil.

Revealing his decision to a gathering of cardinals on Sunday, he said 
his ‘strength of mind and body’ had failed in the last few months.

The Vatican denied that any single medical complaint was responsible but
 speculation centred on 85-year-old Benedict’s arthritis problems.

He 
needs a moving platform to take him to the altar in St Peter’s, and it 
is difficult for him to kneel and pray.

On Monday it emerged that the Pope made his decision to quit last April following a tour of Mexico and Cuba.

The resignation, to take effect on the last day of this month, means a 
conclave of senior cardinals will meet in Rome to choose a successor by 
the end of March.

He sprung his surprise at a meeting to canonise three new saints.

Some cardinals didn’t understand what Benedict had told them and others 
looked stunned. ‘All the cardinals remained shocked and were looking at 
each other,’ said Monsignor Oscar Sanchez, who was in the room at the 
time.

After the news was announced to the wider world Benedict said in a 
statement: ‘I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an 
advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the 
Petrine ministry (the papacy).

Odilo Scherer, 63, Archbishop of Sao Paolo, is one of the younger contenders for the job

‘In today’s world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by 
questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern 
the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind 
and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has 
deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognise my 
incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.’

A Vatican spokesman admitted: ‘It has taken us by surprise a bit.’

The 
Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, said it was ‘a
 bolt from the blue’.

Among those with knowledge of the state of the Pope’s health is his 
brother, Georg, 89. He said yesterday: ‘His age is weighing on him. My 
brother wants more rest.’

The Pope had demanding tours ahead of him, including a visit to Brazil in July for the church’s World Youth Day.

The Vatican said his immediate future will be spent at Castel Gandolfo, 
the Papal villa south of Rome, and that after his resignation he will 
retreat to a monastery.

Tom Montgomery, a second year seminarian from the diocese of Westminster
 studying at the Vatican said: ‘We were absolutely gobsmacked. Everyone 
is shocked.

‘But Benedict has been a Pope of surprises. He’s changed from being the 
Cardinal Rottweiler to being a German Shepherd. People said he hadn’t 
the charisma of John Paul. But he is a great teacher. People came to see
 John Paul but they come to hear Ratzinger.’

David Cameron said: ‘His visit to Britain in 2010 is remembered with 
great respect and affection. He will be missed as a spiritual leader to 
millions.’
