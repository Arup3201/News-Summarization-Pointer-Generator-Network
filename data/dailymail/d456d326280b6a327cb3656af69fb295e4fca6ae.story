Restaurateur Gary Newborough had food critics raving about the pizzas at the VIP launch of his trendy new restaurant - until he confessed they were in fact frozen and bought from a local supermarket.

Gary, 58, had promised a ‘taste of Italy’ and a ‘pizza with a real difference’ at the bash at La Pizzeria Ristorante in Manchester’s trendy Northern Quarter.

Around 100 local foodies turned up at the first floor eaterie and were waxing lyrical over the free tasters including 'special' Pizza Pollo and Pizza Spinaci.

Pizzas with a difference: Gary Newborough, 58, had promised a 'taste of Italy' and a 'pizza with a real difference' at his VIP bash to launch La Pizzeria Ristorante

But the penny dropped when a note was passed round later that night revealing the food was in fact Dr Oetker pizzas bought from the freezer from a nearby high street store for just £2.78 each.

Bizarrely the restaurant will be now serving the frozen pizzas until September 7 in the laid-back restaurant kitchen.

Two ‘chefs’ will prepare fresh salad and breadboards and then take the selected pizza out of its box and pop it in the oven. Punters can grab their restaurant-cooked supermarket pizzas with a soft drink and side salad for £4 as part of a lunch special.

Gary, who runs the venue as well as the Market Restaurant downstairs, said: 'We wanted to try and do something a bit different and we thought serving up supermarket pizzas would be a good idea to get people talking.'

People took to Twitter calling it the 'weirdest thing in the history of the Manchester food scene'.

Gary added: 'We wanted to see if they could tell the difference between freshly cooked pizzas and frozen ones from stores. Evidently people didn’t know the difference and were taken in because they loved it so much.

'Unfortunately some people at the launch were a little cross when they found out we were serving frozen supermarket pizzas.

'But they weren’t complaining when it was free and they were going through 36 bottles of sparkling wine that I laid on. It was just a bit of fun and it didn’t cost anybody anything to try it.

'I just liked the idea of doing something that nobody has ever done before.'

In Gary’s Market Restaurant downstairs, he prides himself on using the freshest Lancashire ingredients with dishes including the finest hung Lancashire beef and Bury black pudding.

But with 33 years in the business, he has no regrets about duping critics into tucking into the bargain grub, at last week's bash.

Back for more: guests loved the special 'taste of Italy' until they discovered the pizzas were in fact frozen. But they'll still be on the menu until September 7

He said: 'I had no intention to deceive. The pizzas are called Ristorante and we had Dr Oetker signs on the walls - it’s just a bit of fun for a month and I think it’s bloody good value.

'Great value, great service and in great surroundings - with no horse meat in sight. What more could you want?

'These are the best frozen pizzas around and at least we know what’s in them. I see people carrying boxes of burgers into restaurants and in big letters they say "contains only 30% beef". Why does no-one ask what the rest is?'

No complaints: the blackboard at the restaurant advertises 'unique deep bakery crust pizza with a base that is crispy on the outside, soft and light on the inside'

Floor Manager Chris Alexander, 22, said: 'Cooking frozen pizza is harder than it looks. The bases need to be crispy and they need to be cooked right each time, so it can sometimes be a little tricky,' he said.

'In terms of service and value we can definitely compete with the restaurants around here. It doesn’t matter that the secret’s out, that would defeat the object. We want to show that you can’t tell the difference between the Dr Oetker Ristorante pizzas and proper restaurant meals.

'At the launch most people were complimentary about the taste but we had a few who were a little angry because they felt they had been victims of a prank.'

Twitter contained mixed reaction when news of the restaurant was revealed.

Emma Louise Madden said: 'This Dr Oetker La Pizzeria Ristorante stunt has to be the weirdest thing in the history of the Manchester food scene. Reading it all open-mouthed.'

While Leo’s Fish Bar, a popular Manchester takeaway and cafe tweeted: 'All this talk of Dr Oetker - why didn’t we just serve McCains?'
