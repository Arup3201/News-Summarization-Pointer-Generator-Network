Hoax: Neil McArdle, 36, was jailed for 12 months after he sparked a bomb scare at his wedding venue rather than tell his fiancée he had failed to finalise their marriage plans at St George's Hall, Liverpool

A groom who made a hoax call pretending explosives were hidden at his wedding venue just days after the Boston bombings has been sentenced to a year in prison.

Neil McArdle sparked the bomb scare because he did not want to tell his bride-to-be that he had failed to finalise their wedding plans.

The 36-year-old, who has been jailed for 12 months, has been criticised by a Judge who told him that his call 'struck terror' into venue staff, who would have had the explosions in Boston at the forefront of their minds.

Panic-stricken McArdle had telephoned St George's Hall in Liverpool and told how explosives had been planted in the building to hide his blunder with the booking because he could not face telling his fiancée.

Bride-to-be Amy Williams turned up to 
the famous Grade II listed venue wearing her white dress, only to discover the 
venue for her big day was swarming with police.

Although
the couple had pencilled in a date at the iconic building, the 
embarrassed groom realised he had not filled in the ‘right to marry’ 
forms to legalise the marriage.

McArdle, of Kirkby in Merseyside, admitted making a hoax call in a panic, from a phone box near his home.

He told a receptionist: 'There’s a bomb in St George’s Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes.'

Following the call the building was placed on lock down while bomb disposal units and police officers searched the venue from top to bottom.

However, when the building was re-opened later in the day, the venue confirmed that no booking for the wedding had been made.

McArdle had planned to marry Miss
Williams at Liverpool Register Office, which is situated within the 
listed St George’s Hall, on April 24.

It is understood McArdle and Miss 
Williams are still together but, six months on from the incident, have 
still not tied the knot and have no plans to do so.

Threats: McArdle called the Grade II-listed St George's Hall in Liverpool and told staff that there were explosives hidden inside the famous building

Plans: McArdle and his fiancée had pencilled in a date to get married at the hall, but he never filled in the 'right to marry' forms to legalise the marriage

He pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information with intent at an earlier hearing at Liverpool Crown Court.

Sentencing McArdle today, Judge Norman Wright said: 'I just don’t accept that the penny dropped on the night before the wedding.

'You are an intelligent man with a degree. Maybe there was an ambivalence in your mind about the wedding and suddenly you got yourself into quite a predicament.

'It seems that you buried your head in the sand until the day of the wedding.'

The judge said that the hoax call had been made just days after two explosions went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, leaving three dead, and that the tragedy 'must have been at the very forefront of peoples’ minds'.

He added: 'Your call to St George’s Hall must have struck sheer terror in the heart of the person that received the call and fear in the minds of the people who are charged with the responsibility of the safety of people inside the building.

'You knew that the wedding couldn’t take place and you didn’t try to level with your partner.

'Instead, you tried to weasel your way out of the situation.

'It seems there was a betrayal of trust in your relationship. I hope you learn from this experience but you have to understand that bomb hoaxes are extremely serious.'
