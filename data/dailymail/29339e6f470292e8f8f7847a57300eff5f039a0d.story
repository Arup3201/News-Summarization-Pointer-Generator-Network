Zinedine Zidane joined in the clamour for the highly-rated midfielder Paul Pogba by claiming it is 'only logical' that Real Madrid want him on board at the Bernabeu.

The France international, who is currently nursing a hamstring injury, extended his contract with the Old Lady until the end of the 2018-19 season back in October, however he has been consistently linked with a move away from Turin.

The 22-year-old has attracted interest from a number of top European clubs, with Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Madrid all being tipped as potential suitors.

Pogba has been a key figure for Juventus this season and is a much sought after talent throughout Europe

Keen on a return to the Premier League, Pogba is reported to be part of a £100million summer wishlist at former club United and is also understood to have been closely monitored by Manchester City and Chelsea.

With so much attention surrounding the young star - who has netted seven goals in 22 Serie A appearances this season - Zidane feels such interest should not come as a surprise to those aware of his talents.

'When we are talking about a player like Pogba, it is only logical Real Madrid are interested in signing him,' Zidane told French channel Canal+.

'He is a player with immense potential, who still has an important margin for improvement.

'He is still young and has an exciting future ahead of him.

'Where Pogba will play next season? I don't know the answer to that question. You will have to ask him.'
