Traffic cameras captured the horrifying moment a motorcyclist slammed into a SUV at a Missouri  junction, and was sent flying through the air.

Britt Hamilton bounced of the vehicle's windscreen before landing on top of his bike, but the 20-year-old father walked away from the crash with just minor injuries.

He had been traveling in front of a car carrying his fiancée and their 10-month-old daughter, when he was involved in the head on collision last Friday.

Shocking: Britt Hamilton is flung head first into the SUV as its driver tried to turn at a junction

Lucky escape: Britt Hamilton suffered a cut lip and some bruising but managed to avoid serious injury

Mr Hamilton said he had no time to react when he realized that the driver approaching him was about to turn.

The motorcyclist said the traffic lights were green as he went through them, but as the SUV came through the junction, the driver tried to turn.

'By the time I hit the brakes, there was nothing I could do to avoid the crash and slammed into the front end, flipped over the handlebars and totaled my bike,' he told KMBC.

The footage shows one of his shoes being flung over the roof of the SUV as the force of the impact wrenched it from his foot.

Mr Hamilton is also seen getting back on his feet before appearing to double over in pain. He said that immediately after the crash he went numb then 'started to feel pain'.

His fiancée, Brittany Pennington, told KCTV5: It's something I never want to witness again ... Just a scary thought knowing I could have lost him.'

A spokesman for the Excelsior police said Mr Hamilton's injuries could have been worse if he hadn't been wearing a helmet.

Despite the crash looking horrific, he managed to avoid serious injury, and even managed to reclaim his shoe.

'My wrist is swollen. My lip is messed 
up a little bit. I got a little knot on my leg. I'm surprised I didn't get a broken bone or something,' he said.

Damaged: Britt Hamilton may have survived the crash but his motorbike, above, didn't do quite as well

Sadly, the same can't be said for Mr Hamilton's motorbike which had just been repainted three days before the crash, and
 has suffered serious damage.

Police are investigating the crash and say that possible charges could be brought. It was reported that the driver had only a learner's permit.
