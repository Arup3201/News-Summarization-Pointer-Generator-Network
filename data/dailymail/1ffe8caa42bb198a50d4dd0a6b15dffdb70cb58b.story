The head of Britain’s new press regulator has said he is ‘determined’ for the press to take its own code of practice seriously.

Sir Alan Moses, chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), said: ‘We are determined to be, for the first time, a regulator. The Press Complaints Commission was not a regulator, it was a complaints handler and we wish to be an independent regulator.

‘The press said they wanted an independent regulator and we are going to hold them to that and we believe that we can achieve that.’

He added that it was his belief that complaints were being dealt with more speedily and taken ‘far more seriously than previously’.

The former appeal court judge said he had only agreed to take the job last year after receiving assurances that he would be able to operate independently from the Press.

He said it was too early to declare success, but told MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport committee that the regulator was already having a significant impact on the way the media deals with complaints.

Earlier, a pro-privacy campaigner told the culture select committee that she does not have faith in the new press regulator because it is the ‘same old thing’.

Hannah Weller, founder of the Protect campaign for children’s privacy, said she had initially ‘great hope’ following the Leveson inquiry but had been left disappointed.

She told the hearing: ‘I think it (Ipso) is the same old thing, it’s changed its outfit and changed its name but it’s behaving in same way.

‘Even in the short-term period post-Leveson, post the introduction of Ipso, who is to say when the heat is off in five years time it’s not going to go back to old ways?

‘I don’t think it’s independent enough and I don’t think the general public have faith in it.’
