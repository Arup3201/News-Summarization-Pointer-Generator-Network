The volunteer wildlife rescue clinic which won the nation's heart after saving dozens of animals from January's Adelaide bushfires, is in danger of being forced to shut down after incurring $200,000 worth of legal fees.

The Australian Marine Wildlife Research and Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) is the only group in South Australia that is licensed to rescue, rehabilitate and release marine wildlife and the only organisation in the country with a purpose-built facility to hold them long term.

President and founder Aaron Machado said AMWRRO rescues dozens of animals each day, from turtles to seals and sea birds, and that the organisation's closure would be 'a blow to not only South Australia, but to all of Australia'.

The nonprofit group is the only organisation in South Australia that is licensed to rescue, rehabilitate and release marine wildlife. A net killed a juvenile fur seal which washed ashore  in October

They also regularly help  native wildlife and continue to treat koalas and kangaroos who were injured in the Adelaide brushfires earlier this year 

'There would be nothing left in South Australia to help these sea creatures. We are the only ones,' Mr Machado told Daily Mail Australia.

'Every day we see seals who have been entangled in fishing tackle, turtles who come up after eating plastic, animals who have been attacked by dogs. Sea birds are our biggest clientèle though.'

The nonprofit organisation, which has almost 500 registered volunteers, was sued for defamation by an employee at the Department of Environment Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR) three years ago and lost the court battle on January 22 of this year.

'I sent an email to minister a few years ago about an animal welfare case outlining my concerns and the individual mentioned in the email believed he was defamed and launched defamation proceedings against me and the organisation,' Mr Machado explained.

Jeffery the sea bird was caked in fatty grease when he was helped by the organisation, which is facing closure after incurring $200,000 in legal fees. The pelican had found his way into an uncovered 'grease trap' at a waste management depot and underwent a two hour scrub to remove 95 per cent of the fat

The group was sued for defaming a state government worker in an email and now could be forced to shut down due to being unable to afford the $200,000 fee 

The loss means that AMWRRO has to pay damages of $59,000 as well as both their opposition's and their own legal costs on top of the court fees: a total estimated value of $200,000.

'We are a non-profit organisation that I have funded by mortgaging my house four times in the last 17 years every time we need medical equipment or a boat,' Mr Machado said.

'We run off membership costs, donations and corporate sponsorship. We are a state wide organisation which works all over Australia without government funding.

'It costs $50,000 a year to run the organisation and we'll be lucky to have that in our account let alone the $200,000. The money we do get coming in on an annual basis it difficult enough to maintain without having something like this come up.'

In January, AMWRRO rescued Jeremy, who suffered second-degree partial thickness burns on all his four paws from the raging bushfires in South Australia

Before and after: Jeremy's paws have recovered greatly since the koala recieved intensive care treatment

The organisation is still in the process of assisting dozens of native animals, including koalas and kangaroos, after the state's bushfires destroyed their homes

Although Mr Machado plans to appeal the judge's decision, asked what would happen if his appeal fails, he said: 'We'll have to shut down, sell the assets and pay the lawyers. There will be thousands of animals who lose out.'

One young koala, which AMWRRO named Jeremy, won the nation's heart earlier this year after he was pictured in a critical condition from second-degree partial thickness burns on all four of his paws. 

Jeremy (pictured right after his rescue) has since made a full recovery and been released back near where he was initially rescued 

The group hopes to raise the $200,000 worth of legal fees through fundraising

Donations to help keep AMWRRO running can be made at their My Cause page, here. This young kangaroo was found with her foot badly entangled in stainless steel wire that had cut through the tissue and caused an infection

'He's in a lot of pain and severely dehydrated but he's stabilised and doing okay for now,' Mr Machado said of the two-year-old koala at the time. 

Jeremy has since made a full recovery and been released back in the area where he was initially rescued.
