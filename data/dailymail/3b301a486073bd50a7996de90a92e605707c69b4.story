Death: Rachel Osei, the teen mother who died in a ball of flames in New Malden, Surrey

The family of a teenage mother who died after running from her house engulfed in flames believe she died as the result of a tragic accident.

Rachel Osei, 18, was heard screaming in agony as she ran from her home in New Malden, Surrey, before collapsing and dying at a level crossing on West Barnes Lane.

The 18-year-old was studying to be a PE teacher at St Mary’s University in Twickenham and was mother to four-year-old son Kai.

Her distraught brother, Justin, 20, said his younger sister was 'always dancing' and believes Sunday’s incident was a 'tragic accident', rather than self-inflicted.

The law student from Colliers Wood, south west London, paid tribute to his sister: 'Rachel was very funny and outgoing. She loved dancing and was always doing it and was a really good drummer.

'She enjoyed sports as well and wanted to be a PE teacher.

'She was a really good mum, her son was always dressed well and was happy.

'When she had him she was young but dealt with it really well. She did well at school and got good GCSEs, which allowed her to stay on for A-Levels.

'Rachel was ambitious and always wanted to go to university and do well for her son.

'She was always happy and I’ll always remember whenever we had a family photo, we both would pull the silliest face so every picture we have when we were younger is us being silly.

'We grew up together with my mum, who is devastated. Rachel moved out when she was about 17 but used to come and visit all the time as her friends are all still in the area.

'I know some people are saying what happened is self-inflicted but it was a tragic accident. The fire started by accident and it caught on her clothes but I can’t say anything else about it.

Tragic: The mother of four-year-old Kai was training to be a PE teacher at University

'Over the past month I was trying to 
call her and trying to meet her but she was busy with her university 
work so the last time I saw her was probably November.

'She was her usual, happy self and was excited because she was trying to pass her driving test.

'We have always been outgoing, like listening to music and dancing around, but Rachel especially.

'The
 way people cared for Rachel around here was very loving and she had a 
lot of people in the community helping her with her son and buying him 
things.

'She had a lot of friends and a lot of love to give.'

The London Ambulance Service, the London Fire Brigade and the Met police were called to the level crossing at around 1.10am on Sunday, but Rachel was pronounced dead at 1.45am.

A post mortem carried out yesterday at St George’s Hospital gave the cause of death as burns and inhalation of fire fumes.

Police say her death is being treated as unexplained, but early indications suggest it is not suspicious.

Neighbours said Miss Osei’s 
four-year-old-son Kai was staying with relatives at the time of the 
tragedy, which happened on Saturday.

Investigators
 are treating her death as ‘unexplained’, but it is understood their 
main line of inquiry is that her injuries may have been self-inflicted.

Her heartbroken father Jonathan Osei, 48, has also said he could not understand what had happened.

‘Rachel
 was at university training to be a sports teacher,’ he said. ‘She 
wanted to do well and provide for her son. When I heard about the fire I
 tried to call her on her mobile phone but there was no answer. I tried 
to protect her but I could not.

‘I loved Rachel, she was a lovely, lovely daughter. I named her after my mother. I had four children but now I have only three.’

The teenager's mother was said to be too upset to talk about the horrific incident this afternoon.

Queen Mary's University, where the young mother was training to be a PE teacher, has also paid tribute.

The Twickenham university said in a statement: 'We received the tragic news regarding Rachel's death with great sadness.

'Rachel
 was a promising Physical Secondary Education (PSE) student who will be 
missed by staff and students across the St Mary's community and we 
extend our deepest sympathy to her family and friends at this very sad 
time.'

Investigation: Police have sealed off a nearby house and said they were treating the death as 'unexplained'

Leeanne Muller, 18, from Wimbledon Chase, said: 'Rachel was bubbly and liked to talk - she was happy.

'She
 was enthusiastic about her future and used to tell me about how was 
going to be rich by doing what she loved doing. She liked rapping and 
playing sports.

'She used to talk about her son and how much she loved him and how she wanted him to have a good life. She was a very good mum.

'I've been her friend for a long time and used to look after Kai sometimes. He'll be devastated.

'I only found out what happened this morning and it's horrible, really shocking.'
