Registered a complaint: Adam Landerman, 21, has moaned about the conditions inside Will County Adult Detention Facility while awaiting trial for a double murder

The 21-year-old son of an Illinois police office waiting trial for two brutal murders appears to have confused his prison for a hotel.

Adam Landerman of Joliet filed a 15-count complaint to a Will County judge about the conditions at Will Country Adult Detention Facility, moaning about the timing and quality of meals and that the towels are too small.

Whining that the prison is too cold for him while he awaits trial for the murders of Terrance Rankins and Eric Glover, the particular inmate has been told quite curtly by local law enforcement to put up or shut up.

'We’re not a hotel; we’re a jail,' Will County Sheriff’s Deputy Chief Ken Kaupas said.

'We treat all of our in-custodies in a fair way.'

Among the litany of complaints from Landerman are that the jail serves boring, small plates of food and that the library is not stocked to his satisfaction.

Landerman has claimed that he is being treated indecently because he is forced to wake and eat breakfast at 6.15am every morning and eat lunch at 10am.

'The meals served to detainees at the WCADF are wholly and completely inadequate in quantity to satisfy grown male detainees, leaving them suffering from hunger pangs and leading to altercations with other detainees and rule violations involving hoarding and storing food,' Landerman moans in his complaint according to The Chicago Tribune.

He also demands 'up to date' library books be provided, free soap for shaving and the heat be turned up because it is causing him 'sleep deprivation'.

He claims the conditions are in violation of state code and wants them fixed. The complaint is scheduled to be heard in court on August 28.

Landerman has been in custody since the murders of Eric Glove and Terrence Ranking, both 22, in January 2013 after an attempted robbery.

Police have charged him and two co-conspirators with strangling the two and then continuing to play video games next to the dead men.

Charged: Joshua Miner, 26, of Joliet, and Bethany McKee, 20, of Shorewood, also are in jail awaiting trial on murder charges in the Joliet slayings

Testifying against her friends: Alisa Massaro, 20, of Joliet, recently pled guilty to lesser charges of robbery and concealing a homicide

At the time police described the murders as horrific.

'This is one of the most brutal, heinous and upsetting things I’ve ever seen in my 27 years of law enforcement,' Police Chief Mike Trafton said in January 2013.

'Not only the crime scene, but the disregard for common decency toward human beings.'

Joshua Miner, 26, of Joliet and Bethany McKee, 20, of Shorewood, are also incarcerated in jail charged with the murders.

The other person present that evening, Alisa Massaro, 20, of Joliet, pleaded guilty recently to the lesser charges of robbery and concealing a homicide in exchange for a 10-year sentence and to also testify against the others.

Police claim that the four lured Glover and Rankins to Massaro's home and murdered them.

McKee left them while they were playing video games and returned home where she confessed to her father, who called the police and told them where they were.
