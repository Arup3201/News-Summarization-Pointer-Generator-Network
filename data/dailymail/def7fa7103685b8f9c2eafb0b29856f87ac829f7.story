Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords today celebrated her incredible recovery from the shooting that nearly took her life three years ago - by leaping thousands of feet out of an airplane.

Giffords, 43, was shot in the head in the January 2011 attack in Tucson, Arizona, by gunman Jared Loughner in a horrific attack that left six others dead and 13 wounded.

Now the face of the national gun control effort, she has made a grueling but remarkable recovery, learning how to talk and walk again.

Brave Giffords skydived to mark the third anniversary of the attack. The shooting will also be commemorated with bell-ringing, flag-raising ceremonies and church events across Tucson.

After the dive Giffords blew kisses to the media, waved, and described the experience as 'wonderful.'

Happy: Gabrielle Giffords blew kisses to the media, waved, and her skydive 'was wonderful'

According to her Facebook page she did the tandem  skydive jump with her friend, former Navy SEAL Jimmy Hatch.

Savannah Guthrie of ABC's Today show announced the plans on Wednesday morning and the event will be aired on Thursday.

'Today,
 Gabby Giffords is going to do something that is incredibly courageous 
and inspiring and a little bit surprising - she's going to sky-dive here
 in Arizona to commemorate the three-year anniversary and all of the 
progress that she's made,' the show's co-anchor said.

Guthrie
 continued: 'She is an incredibly brave person. She's someone who used 
to love to sky-dive before this shooting took place. She hasn't done it 
since.' Giffords skydived once before, in 2009.

Earlier
 in the week, officials also announced plans for a permanent memorial in
 remembrance of the shootings expected to be located at the Old Pima 
County Courthouse and in an adjacent park.

The
 sites would display some of the thousands of items, including letters, 
candles and flags, that were placed in storage after forming makeshift 
memorials across the city in the days after the shooting.

'This
 memorial will remind the world of what happened here,' U.S. Rep. Ron 
Barber said. 'But more importantly... what happened afterward: the 
kindness, the caring and love that came forward.

'And you will see that when you look at the archives, it represents Tucson at its very, very best.'

Giffords also pleaded for patience in gun control in an op-ed printed in the New York Times on Wednesday's third anniversary of the attack.

The former Congresswoman 
she likened her gun control fight to her time in recovery writing: 'Our 
fight is a lot more like my rehab. Every day, we must wake up resolved 
and determined.

'We’ll pay 
attention to the details; look for opportunities for progress, even when
 the pace is slow. Some progress may seem small, and we might wonder if 
the impact is enough, when the need is so urgent. '

But
 every day we will recruit a few more allies, talk to a few more elected
 officials, convince a few more voters. Some days the steps will come 
easily; we’ll feel the wind at our backs. Other times our knees will 
buckle. We’ll tire of the burden. I know this feeling. But we’ll 
persist.

'We can get tough and win elections. We’ll support our allies. And those who stood in the way will face a powerful advocacy community standing between them and re-election.

Ms Giffords is pro-gun ownership but anti-gun violence.

Miracle: The first look at Giffords in hospital shows her scars and bruises after she was shot in the head

In October Ms Giffords toured rows of 
tables loaded with rifles and handguns today in her first visit to a gun
 show since surviving the 2011 shooting.

She
 visited the Saratoga Springs Arms Fair with her astronaut husband, Mark
 Kelly and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to highlight a 
voluntary agreement that closely monitors gun show sales in New York.

We
 must never stop fighting,' she said at a post-tour news conference, her
 fist in the air. 'Fight! Fight! Fight! Be bold! Be courageous!'

Ms Giffords,slowly walked 
hand-in-hand with Mr Kelly through the large room where Winchester 
rifles, muzzle-loaders, antique knives and other weapons were on display
 and 'Don't Tread on Me' flags hung from poles.

They
 stopped at display tables, Mr Kelly asked dealers questions about the 
weapons, and Ms Giffords shook hands and smiled when people greeted her.

'Good to see you looking good!' some said.

Survivor: Gabrielle Giffords, pictured soon after the January 2011 shooting, suffered a gunshot wound to the head but survived

Gunman Jared Loughner shot Giffords in 2011

Kelly bought a book on Colt revolvers, and said later he probably would have bought a gun if he had had more time. He said both he and his wife are gun owners.

The
 trio mixed with a gun show crowd that was mostly welcoming - with a few
 hostile undertones before calling for people to build on the 
cooperative effort.

In June it was revealed Mr Kelly likes to do target practice with exactly the same kind of gun which was used to shoot her - as she cheers him on from their porch.

The couple admit they still love the ‘gun culture’ and argue that their knowledge of guns gives them more credibility with the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association.

They have made themselves strident gun campaigners and Giffords’ face is now on a huge billboard in New York’s Times Square asking for tougher checks on those buying firearms.

Mr Kelly bought the assault rifle in March at a gun shop in Tucson to show how easy it was to buy such a weapon.

But after his motives became public the shop owner refused to hand it over and gave him a refund, claiming that it was not for ‘personal use’ so he could not sell it.

At the time, Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make.

He said: ‘If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt. If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.’
