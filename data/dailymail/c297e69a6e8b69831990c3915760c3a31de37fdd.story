Convicted child killer Brett Peter Cowan, who tore the Morcombe family to pieces when he killed 13-year-old Daniel 10 years ago, has been seen behind bars for the first time looking visibly fit and healthy.

The mug shot of the once gaunt and frail looking Cowan, obtained by Channel 7, shows the prisoner with a fuller face and facial hair just four months after he was jailed within Australia's maximum security prison - the Wolston Correctional Centre.

The image has brought disgust to the faces of Bruce and Denise Morcombe, Daniel's parents, who are still tormented by the man who abused and killed their son when he chocked him in an abandoned house in 2003.

Daniel Morcombe went missing from a Sunshine Coast bus stop back in 2003

It is an unwanted reminder of their son's killer, Bruce Morcombe said, who highlighted that despite his change in physical appearance is still the same man who abducted Daniel from a Sunshine Coast bus stop 10 years ago before killing him.

'You can't change a leopard's spots,' he said, as he and wife Denise painfully looked at the image of Cowan when shown by a Channel 7 reporter.

'The goatee, chin-beard is very prominent...he does look a little porky.'

Denise Morcombe found his look equally as unflattering: 'He's grown his goatee back..and he's died his hair darker,' as she described the man as an evil child killer and molester that nobody liked.

'No one likes a child killer or molester, and that's what Cowan is,' she said in the Channel 7 interview.

It is the first time Bruce and Denise Morcombe had seen their son's killer since he was led away from Brisbane Supreme Court following his  sentencing.

When he was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower.

Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell.

He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates.

In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor.

He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside.

Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars.

In a message to Cowan Mr Morcombe told the father of three neither he nor his wife 'feel sorry for sorry him'

'Suck it up,' he said.

The parents of Daniel Morcombe leave Brisbane court after Cowan was found guilty for the murder o Daniel in March last year

Back in March Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse.

The Morcombe family declined to be present for the sentencing, in which Supreme Court Judge Roslyn Atkinson spoke at length about Cowan's crimes.

She described his crime as 'entirely abhorrent.' 'You didn't look like a monster, you didn't look like a peadophile, you looked like an ordinary person,' she said.

'You knew if he ran away, you'd be caught. So you killed him. You killed him because you didn't want to get caught.

'Everything you did to that boy is horrific and disgraceful. I've seen no evidence in the months you've been in this court that you ever felt any remorse for what you did.

'You have tragically and pointlessly snuffed out a young life.'
