A Mongols bikie member will be extradited from the US this week where he has been living the high life with his pregnant girlfriend to face murder charges.

Wade Yates-Taui is charged with the unlawful killing of rival Bandidos bikie associate Max Waller on the Gold Coast in June last year.

The 22-year-old is expected to face a Gold Coast court on Friday, but police have refused to confirm his arrival time back in Australia, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.

Police allege Yates-Taui was involved in the stabbing death of Mr Waller, who was found outside a Broadbeach apartment complex with 28 stab wounds on June 23 last year.

Yates-Taui was arrested by US Marshals in the Californian mountain resort of Big Bear Lake in April and has been housed at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Los Angeles ever since.

He had been partying with chapters of bikie gangs in Thailand and the US since Mr Waller's death.

An LA court was told Yates-Taui agreed to 'expedited extradition' and would remain in US custody until Australian police could pick him up.

Yates-Taui fled the Gold Coast on December 10, just a day before he was due before a Crime and Misconduct Commission into his alleged involvement in Mr Waller's death, according to court documents.

A warrant for his arrest was issued on April 7 by the Coolangatta Magistrates Court at Broadbeach.

Yates-Taui had fled Australia with his pregnant model girlfriend, Raquel Petit, in December

US Marshals tracked Yates-Taui and his girlfriend, model Raquel Petit, in the US via their Facebook postings and eventually arrested him at Big Bear.

At his first LA court appearance on April 30 Petit yelled out 'I love you' as Yates-Taui was being led out of court.

'I love you too. Don't talk to anyone,' Yates-Taui replied.
