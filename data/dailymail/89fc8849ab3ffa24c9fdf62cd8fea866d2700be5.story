Labour’s refusal to say Germany started the First World War makes them unfit for office, Boris Johnson said today.

The London Mayor condemned the party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt for claiming it was ‘crass’ and ‘ugly’ to pin the blame for the Great War on Germany.

It marks an escalation in the political row over how Britain should mark this year’s centenary of the outbreak of the conflict in 1914.

Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove last week attacked the left-wing academics for fuelling myths about the First World War, accusing shows like Blackadder of belittling Britain and clearing Germany of blame.

Mr Hunt yesterday accused Mr Gove of trying to use the WWI centenary to ‘sow political division’, condemning ‘ugly’ and ‘crass’ attacks by the Conservatives.

He wrote in The Observer: ‘Whether you agree or disagree, given the deaths of 15 million people during the war, attempting to position 1918 as a simplistic, nationalistic triumph seems equally foolhardy, not least because the very same tensions re-emerged to such deadly effect in 1939.’

Mr Hunt, an historian who was elected to 
the Commons in 2010, said that the case put forward by Mr Gove, Max 
Hastings and Fritz Fischer that the conflict ‘was a necessary act of 
resistance against a militaristic Germany bent on warmongering and 
imperial aggression’ overlooked internal opposition to Kaiser Wilheim 
II.

But Mr Johnson hit back today, accusing Mr Hunt of ‘talking total twaddle’, adding: ‘If Tristram Hunt seriously denies that German militarism was at the root of the First World War, then he is not fit to do his job, either in opposition or in government, and should resign. If he does not deny that fact, he should issue a clarification now.’

Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson added: ‘It is a sad but undeniable fact that the First World War – in all its murderous horror – was overwhelmingly the result of German expansionism and aggression.

‘That fact is, alas, not one that the modern Labour Party believes it is polite to mention.’

Downing Street appeared to back Mr Johnson today, insisting Britain 'should not be afraid' to make clear why it needed to stand up to German aggression.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ‘The prime minister’s view is that the centenary of the First World War is an opportunity to do three things, one obviously to commemorate the fallen, second, there’s an opportunity of course to learn about the impact the conflict had on our country and the world because of course there were very significant impacts on us as a society and as an economy as a result.

‘And thirdly of course to reflect on the achievement of peace for the most part, with some tragic exceptions obviously such as the Balkans conflict in the 1990s, but for the most part on peace in Europe following the two conflicts which scarred the first half.

‘So there’s an opportunity for us to do that, and I think we can do that without being afraid of saying it was right for Britain to respond to aggression and to enter the war on that basis.

'So those are the things we can do, and we can do those without being afraid that it was right for Britain to respond in the way that it did.’

The political battle over how the Great World War should be remembered has focussed in particular on whether the BBC sitcom Blackadder should be shown in schools.

Mr Gove argued: ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What a Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder, as a misbegotten shambles – a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite. Even to this day there are Left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths.’

Blackadder star Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick in the series, branded Mr Gove ‘very silly’.

Sir Tony, a prominent member of the Labour Party who once sat on its national executive, said: ‘I think Mr Gove has just made a very silly mistake. It is not that Blackadder teaches children about World War One.

‘When imaginative teachers bring it in, it’s simply another teaching tool,’ he told Sky News.

‘They probably take them over to Flanders to have a look at the sights out there, have them marching around the playground, read the poems of Wilfred Owen to them. And one of the things that they’ll do is show them Blackadder.’
