A record number of viewers tuned in to watch ESPN's coverage of the dramatic World Cup draw between the U.S. and Portugal.

The nail-biting match, which ended tied 2-2 after a last-second goal by Portugal, held American viewers captive til the bittersweet end.

It drew an average 9.6 household overnight rating for the sports network, or about 18 million viewers, its best ever for World Cup coverage. Almost 23 million people were watching at the peak hour of 730 to 8pm EST based on a 11.9 rating.

Those ratings compare with the approximately 16 million viewers in their home market who watched the U.S. beat Ghana 2-1 last week.

The ratings are equal to ABC's audience in the second round match of the 2010 World Cup between the U.S. and Ghana, Forbes reported, citing Nielsen data. 

Washington, DC, was judged the most soccer-crazed of the top 10 metered markets in the U.S., drawing a 13.3 share of the match, followed by Columbus, Ohio, with 12.6 and New York at 12.5. 

Sunday's game ranked as the third-highest recorded in the U.S. 
English-speaking market for a World Cup match, behind two games carried 
on ABC during the 1994 tournament.
