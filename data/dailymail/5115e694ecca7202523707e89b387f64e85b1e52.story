The Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday it approved a nerve-stimulating headband as the first medical device to prevent migraine headaches.

Agency officials said the device, priced at $249.99 at Costco, provides a new option for patients who cannot tolerate migraine medications.

The Cefaly device is a battery-powered plastic band worn across the forehead.

The device is battery-powered and worn around the head, with the actual TENS stimulator centered on the forehead just above the eye

Using an adhesive electrode, the band emits a low electrical current to stimulate nerves associated with migraine pain. Users may feel a tingling sensation on the skin where the electrode is applied.

The device is designed to be used no more than 20 minutes a day by patients 18 years and older.

A 67-person study reviewed by the FDA showed patients using the device experienced fewer migraines per month than patients using a placebo device.

The Cefaly headband did not completely eliminate migraine headaches or reduce the intensity of migraines that occurred.

According to the FDA a migraine is defined as 'intense pulsing or throbbing pain in one area of the head, accompanied by nausea or vomiting and sensitivity to light or sound.'

About 53 percent of 2,313 patients in a separate study said they were satisfied with the device and were willing to purchase it for future use.

No serious adverse events were connected with the device.

The most common complaint was not wanting to use the device because users 'didn't like the feeling.' Some people reported feeling sleepy during the treatment and some had a headache after.

Cephaly is manufactured by Cephaly Technology of Belgium.
