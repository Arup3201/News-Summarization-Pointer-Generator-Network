Emily Scarratts’s brilliant solo try seven minutes from full time in Paris on Sunday allowed England’s women to sweep away the pain of past near-misses and secure World Cup glory at last.

This was redemption for Gary Street’s side. This was the euphoric occasion when they banished the demons of the last three finals, each one of which had ended in agonising defeat. This was the culmination of four years of fervent dedication, as captain Katy Mclean lifted the trophy which had remained stubbornly out of reach for so long.

Yet, the dream was only realised after a hefty dose of tension and drama at Stade Jean Bouin, as England were pushed to the limit by a tenacious Canadian side. Going into the final 10 minutes, the underdogs had closed the deficit to five points, gained the upper hand in the set-piece and were swarming forward in search of the decisive score.

Under extreme pressure, England were in danger of unravelling. They were making basic errors which they had not done in the semi-final demolition of Ireland and were lacking any real fluency in their attacking game as their opponents competed strongly at the breakdown and in defence.

The Red Rose line-up were within touching distance of their destiny but they needed a moment of inspiration to guard against a last-gasp upset. Scarratt delivered it.

In the 73rd minute, England were awarded a penalty and kicked to touch on the right. When the ball was won at the lineout, the Lichfield centre’s powerful burst took her through two tackles into the Canadian 22 and she carved a superb diagonal line to go clear and over for the crucial try.

After being mobbed by jubilant team-mates, the 24-year-old then knocked over the conversion to add to her earlier three penalties, to complete a 16-point personal haul.

Soon afterwards, despite one last red wave of defiance, the English celebrations began in earnest.

Mclean broke away from the pandemonium to acclaim Scarratt, saying: ‘She is phenomenal. She is a world-class player and she showed that today on a world-class stage.’

The skipper added: ‘It is 20 years since England last won the World Cup so it is amazing that we have done it. Canada were fantastic but our group of girls and all the staff deserved this. We have had a rough ride.'

This was the last game many of the England players will play for their country and Mclean heralded their contribution, saying: ‘We are going to lose massive figures like Maggie Alphonsi, Joanna McGilchrist and Sophie Hemming. They have done a great job for English rugby and deserved to go out on a high.

‘So many legends who have gone before us haven’t won a World Cup in an England shirt and that was for all of them who were here today and for all of the England rugby family.’

Alphonsi emphatically lived up to her nickname of ‘Maggie the Machine’ with a prodigious display of tackling, breakdown work and tireless harrying of the opposition, while Sarah Hunter also stood tall once again in the back row. Further back, Natasha Hunt was a livewire running threat and Scarratt contributed top-class poaching to go with her goalkicking and wonderful late try.

In a first half awash with adventurous intent on both sides, England had surged clear with a classy opening try in the 33rd minute. After Scarratt and Kay Wilson combined at pace down the left, a clever show-and-go by second row Tamara Taylor created space for Alphonsi to send full back Danielle Waterman hurtling into the right corner.

At 11-0, Street’s team had a strong grip, but Magali Harvey’s three penalties and Canadian ferocity typified by openside Karen Paquin kept the game in the balance until Scarratt’s strike settled it.

England had suffered too much in past finals and gone through too much in the last four years to let this one slip.
