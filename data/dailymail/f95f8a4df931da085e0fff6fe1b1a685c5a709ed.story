A PC who made a false police report that his iPhone had been stolen was caught after he used it to call his girlfriend.

PC Gareth Beard, 35, wanted a new iPhone so pretended his had been snatched in a McDonald’s and created a bogus crime report to back up his fictitious claims.

But the bungling policeman, who worked for the Met, was rumbled when the phone was used to call his girlfriend and home number after he reported it stolen in April 2010.

Gareth Beard was found guilty of reporting his mobile stolen to claim for a new one on his insurance

Beard denied fraud but was convicted following a trial at Southwark Crown Court.

He was spared jail today after Nicholas Yeo, defending, urged a judge to give him a suspended sentence and said Beard had repaid O2 the £489 he conned them out of.

Judge David Higgins told him what he had done was ‘deplorable’ and ‘deeply antisocial.’

He added it ‘greatly undermined’ the confidence and trust the public placed in the police force.

But he said a six-month jail term fitted the crime and was satisfied he could suspend this for two years as it was Beard’s first offence.

Beard will also be tagged, be the subject of a curfew between 8pm and 7am and pay court costs of £1,000.

The judge warned him: 'If you commit any further crime while this sentence is suspended you will be brought back before me and I will sent you straight to prison. No mitigation will save you.'

Asked if he understood Beard answered: 'Yes, your honour.'

The officer lied because he wanted a new Apple iPhone

Sentencing him, Judge Higgins said: 'Your motive for this offence, which in my judgment can only be pre-meditated, was to secure a new phone worth between £400 and £500 through the medium of the company which insurance the allegedly stolen telephone.

'This was an insurance fraud, albeit towards the lower end of the spectrum.

'There is, however, an added dimension to this as you were at the time a serving police officer and you used your position to further this fraud.'

The judge said when Beard was found out he lied repeatedly to cover his tracks.

He added: 'You contended this was merely a product of such things as panic, confusion and foolishness.

'In my judgment it was neither. This was obviously the product of a criminal who in fear of being discovered attempted to lie as a way out of his predicament without success.'

The court heard Beard, of Caterham, Surrey, had been a promising police officer who had received recommendations in his early years.

But after his lip was bitten off during a domestic incident he attended he suffered post-traumatic stress, was put on anti-depressants and he was consigned to a desk job.

Shortly before he committed this crime he had been disciplined by the police for poor timekeeping.

Beard has been facing an internal disciplinary hearing before he quit the force. He now plans to work as a builder.
