Under-30s are to be offered more help to buy their first home, David Cameron suggested today as he sought to revive Britain as a ‘property owning democracy’.

The Prime Minister used a major speech on the economy to warn the average first-time buyer is now 33 years old if they are unable to draw on financial help from their parents.

With less than two weeks before the Budget, Mr Cameron vowed he was ‘determined to tackle’ the housing crisis and suggested a fresh package of help could is being drawn up by ministers.

David Cameron used a speech in Keighly, West Yorkshire to rule out a shift in economic strategy, but hinted at more help for first-time buyers

Speaking in West Yorkshire, Mr Cameron said there was no ‘magic money tree’ that allowed the Government to spend and borrow more.

He rejected calls both from Tory MPs for unfunded tax cuts and from Lib Dem minister Vince Cable for more borrowing, warning any move to abandon the austerity programme would mean ‘interest rates will rise, homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust’.

He added: ‘Even just a one per cent rise in mortgage interest rates would cost the average family £1,000 in extra debt service payments.’

The Prime Minister warned the dream of
home ownership was no beyond too many people, despite a raft of 
government schemes to help people on to the housing ladder.

The Prime Minister warned abandoning Plan A ¿would mean interest rates will rise, homes will be repossessed and businesses will go bust

‘We
don’t want to go back to the days of 110 per cent mortgages and 
encouraging people to take on borrowing that they can’t afford.

‘But it is important that people who work hard and do the right thing are able to buy a home,’ he said.

‘It is a rebuke to those of us who believe in property owning democracy that the average age for someone buying their first home today, without any help from their parents is 33 years old. And we are determined to tackle that.’

Since 2005, the average age for all first-time buyers has remained almost unchanged at 29.

But for those buying without any financial help, it has risen ‘sharply’ from 30 in early 2008 to 33, the Council of Mortgage Lenders found.

The government last year launched its Funding for Lending scheme, which aimed to encourage banks to lend more money to both individuals and businesses.

Mr Cameron claimed that as a result, the cost of a two-year fixed rate £100,000 mortgage with a 10 per cent deposit is now £1,000 cheaper than when the scheme was launched.

The Premier added: ‘It is now possible to buy a new home anywhere in the country with only a 5% deposit, and at very low interest rates.’

Mortgage lending will rise this year 
by £10 billion for the first time since the financial crisis, according 
to industry predictions.

While the average age of all first-time buyers has remained stable at around 29, for those without financial help it has risen sharply to 33

‘And
as we look ahead to the Budget we will consider whether there is more 
we can do to build on this success,’ Mr Cameron added, in the strongest 
hint yet of a new package of help for first-time buyers.

He
also hailed the NewBuy scheme which helps people with smaller deposits 
to buy a newly built home and the Treasury is offering offered 
guarantees for more housing and infrastructure.

However, Labour's shadow chancellor 
Ed Balls said: 'Families, pensioners and businesses across Britain will 
wonder what planet David Cameron is on.

'He
claims the economy is getting better and his plan is working, but 
everyone else knows that the economy is flatlining, living standards are
falling and the deficit is rising to pay for the costs of economic 
failure.'

Speaking at precision grinding engineers Kinetic Landis Ltd, Mr Cameron said there were 'signs that our plan is beginning to work', with jobs being created and the economy rebalancing

Mr Cameron used his pre-Budget speech to warn Britain must stick to its deficit reduction programme or risk being plunged ‘back into the abyss’.

'There are some people who think we don't have to take all these tough decisions to deal with our debts,' he said.

'They say that our focus on deficit reduction is damaging growth. And what we need to do is to spend more and borrow more.

'It's as if they think there's some magic money tree. Well, let me tell you a plain truth: there isn't.

'Margaret Thatcher understood that a tax cut paid for by borrowed money is no tax cut at all when she said: "I’ve not been prepared, ever, to go on with tax reductions if it meant unsound finance".'

Mr Cameron added: 'So yes, we are doing a great deal to help hard working families.  But all of these changes have to be paid for – and they have been paid for.'

The remarks will be seen as a sharp rebuttal to the calls from both Tories and Lib Dems for a change of direction.

Business Secretary Vince Cable used a magazine article to suggest extra borrowing could be used to fund news infrastructure projects

Right wing Conservatives have demanded a raft of tax cuts designed to stimulate the economy, argue the Treasury would recoup the money as firms hired more people.

And on the other side of the argument, Business Secretary Vince Cable has broken ranks to suggest capital spending, funded by borrowing, may be needed to kick-start growth.

He told the New Statesman that the Government’s decision to stick to Labour’s plan to cut capital spending was a mistake which had ‘economic consequences’.

Mr Cable said there was now a legitimate debate about whether the Government should ‘borrow more, at very low interest rates, in order to finance more capital spending - building of schools and colleges, small road and rail projects, more prudential borrowing by councils for house building.’

He told the magazine that the strategy ‘does not undermine the central objective of reducing the structural deficit, and may assist it by reviving growth’.

Mr Cameron was later asked about Mr Cable's intervention. The Prime Minister said: 'The article he wrote in the New Statesman was cleared and approved by the Treasury.

'He backs the measures we are taking on dealing with the budget deficit and also he is playing a very key role in making sure we deliver this agenda of backing the fastest growing areas of our economy that have real potential for the future. I work very closely with him in doing that.'

Earlier, Mr Cable also played down the idea that his comments represented a shift in policy, telling the BBC: 'We just need to pursue what I've often called Plan A-plus. That is financial discipline and getting down the deficit and at the same time pursuing growth. That's what we are doing and will continue to do.'
