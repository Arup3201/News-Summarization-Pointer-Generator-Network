Lance Corporal Todd John Chidgey died in a non-combat incident in Afghanistan

Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey, the Australian who died in Afghanistan from a 'non-combat related incident,' was a consummate gentleman who always remembered birthdays and loved Manchester United - but never spoke of wanting to join the army.

The family of the soldier, who was found by friends with a gunshot wound about 2pm on Tuesday, said they were bewildered at Todd's decision to join the special forces in 2006 in a statement they released after the soldier's death on Tuesday.

Parents Kerrie Baker and Adam Chidgey said although he became accustomed to the discipline, structure and camaraderie of military life, they were mystified when he told them of his plans to pursue a military career back in 2006.

'The reason is still a mystery to us,' Ms Baker and Mr Chidgey said. 'But Todd had his heart set on joining Special Forces, so he put his heart and soul into the selection process.'

As well as a fighter, they said Todd was a man who put his family first and would often be found playing in the park with brothers Adam and Paul or cheering on his favourite NRL side the Canterbury Bulldogs with cousin Gareth.

'If you were his friend, he'd stick by you and he was a champion of the underdog ... he was just so loyal and seemed to have been born mature,' they said.

Lance Corporal Chidgey was on his sixth tour of Afghanistan when he was found dead in the Australian headquarters at the main coalition base in Kabul on Tuesday.

He was farewelled during a special memorial in Kabul and a ramp ceremony will be held when his body is returned to Australia.

Defence has refused to go into the details surrounding the 29-year-old's death while an investigation is pending, but in the meantime Todd's parents have sent their heartfelt appreciation to his 2nd Commando Regiment who found him injured inside the Kabul administration building.

'We would like to take this opportunity to praise the 2nd Commando Regiment for the support they've given us during this sad time,' the statement said.

'They have become extended members of our family, and our hearts are with them as we all deal with the loss of Todd.'Â

Defence said he was a 'consummate professional' who earned the respect of his comrades through dedication and hard work.

'Lance Corporal Chidgey's colleagues in the 2nd Commando Regiment have described him as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates,' Defence said in a statement.

The decorated soldier was born in Gosford, NSW and joined the Australian Defence Force in 2006.

He was posted to what is now the 2nd Commando Regiment, serving in Afghanistan on tours ranging from two weeks to six months.

At the time of his death, Lance Corporal Chidgey was part of the protective security detachment providing protection for a senior Australian officer.

He is the 41st Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan.

Australia has now ended involvement in combat operations in Afghanistan but about 400 personnel remain in a variety of jobs, including headquarters staff and Afghan National Army mentors.

Lance Corporal Chidgey is survived by his mother, father, brothers and partner.

Defence Force chief Mark Binskin on Wednesday said after the incident he soldier was taken to a nearby medical facility for emergency treatment.

'Sadly, the soldier's injuries were too severe and he later died surrounded by his mates,' he said.

The base was in lock down last night so evidence could be collected and the Defence Force has since launched an investigation.

'It is critical that we let this investigation take its course, to examine the evidence and establish the facts rather than to speculate about the details or circumstances surrounding the incident,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said.

Defence offered its condolences to the soldier's family and friends.

So did Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss who described the incident as tragic considering Australia's engagement in Afghanistan had largely ended.

'We don't know a great deal about the details as yet but I certainly extend sympathy to the family and friends of the soldier whose life has been lost. Our feelings are with the family,' he said.

There's also a significant security presence to guard against both Taliban or insider attacks.

The last Australian soldier to die in Afghanistan was another Commando, Corporal Cameron Baird, killed on June 22, 2013 and subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross.

When asked about post-traumatic stress disorder in the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Binskin said: 'I am confident in what Defence does in the mental health space'.

In 2013, former Middle East commander, retired major General John Cantwell, warned of a looming tsunami of PTSD among those who have served in recent operations.
