It's the last place on Earth you would want to play football.

But in 1915, while staring death in the face, British troops from the London Irish Rifles passed this ball between them as they courageously charged across No Man's Land under heavy fire. 

The tattered brown ball ended up in German trenches following the successful but bloody attack at the Battle of Loos - and a century later it has been valued at £15,000 on the Antiques Roadshow. 

Incredible: This ball was kicked across No Man's Land by British soldiers under heavy machine-gun and mortar fire during the Battle of Loos in the First World War

The ball was one of six that soldiers had planned to dribble across the battlefield in a show of British bravado - and utter madness.

But the night before the offensive their commanding officer rumbled them - and  shot five of the balls rendering them useless. 

The one that survived belonged to Sergeant Frank Edwards who hid it from his commanding officer by stuffing it up his tunic moments before going into battle.

He booted the ball into No Man's Land where men from the London Irish Rifles fanned out like a line of forwards - passing it between themselves while being bombarded with mortar and machine-gun fire.

Sergeant Edwards was shot and wounded, and after bouncing into German trenches, the ball was later found wedged in barbed wire and taken back to headquarters.

The ball is on display at the London Irish Rifles Association museum but has been lent to Sergeant Edwards' granddaughter, Sue Harris, who took it to the Antiques Roadshow's First World War special programme to be broadcast this Sunday.

Mrs Harris also presents expert Graham Lay with a bronze statue of her grandfather dressed in uniform holding the ball along with a watercolour painting of the extraordinary charge.

Mr Lay values the ball at between £10,000 and £15,000 and tells Mrs Harris: 'You haven't just got a football here, the football is testament to the bravery, the courage and the morale of your grandfather.'

The Battle of Loos took place on September 25, 1915.

The Battle of Loos was the largest British offensive mounted in 1915 on the Western Front during World War I. The first British use of poison gas occurred and the battle was the first mass engagement of New Army units. 

Date: September 25 – October 14 1915.

Location: Loos, France

British commanders: Field Marshal Douglas Haig and Field Marshal Sir John French. 

British casualties: 50,000 casualties (with at least 20,000 deaths).

German casualties: Approximately 25,000.

Bloodiest day: On September 28 around 8,000 British troops were killed in the space of four hours during an attack on well-defended German positions. 

The regiment's football team hatched their plan to dribble six balls across No Man's Land as they thought it would help distract them from the deadly mission while also shocking the enemy. 

Sergeant Edwards is said to have dribbled the ball 20 yards before he was shot in the thigh. One of his footballing comrades applied a tourniquet to the wound which saved his life.

The injury ended his war and he was discharged from the London Irish Rifles in 1919 and joined the Military Foot Police.

But his name went down in army folklore and he was known as the 'footballer of Loos'. 

A pub in his home town of Twickenham, south west London, was named The Rifleman in his honour.

Mrs Harris said: 'I knew my grandfather until I was ten, he lived with us.. He was a kind man, tall and upright but he never talked to me about the war or to my mother but we knew the story.

'I think he was feeling absolute terror. I think he thought about blocking that out by kicking the ball with his pals.

'I was very possessive of my grandfather, he was the footballer of Loos.'

The ball was previously displayed at the regimental museum in Camberwell, south east London, until 50 years ago.

After that it languished in a container in the sergeant's mess at the museum for the next five decades and in 2011 resurfaced in a decrepit state and in danger of perishing into a pile of dust. 

Conservation experts were called in and after painstaking restoration, the ball was returned to its former glory.

The 1st Battalion of the London Irish Rifles was sent to the Western Front in May 1915 and took part in the first major British offensive of the war in September.

During the ball's restoration, Nigel Wilkinson, vice-chairman of the London Irish Rifles Regimental Association, explained: 'The London Irish had a first class football team and they were keen to score a goal in Jerry's front line trenches.

'One of the platoon commanders thought this was a bad idea and just before the whistles blew for the attack he went round puncturing all those that he could find.'
