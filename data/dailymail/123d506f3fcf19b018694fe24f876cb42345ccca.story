Two British doctors drowned during a holiday in Tenerife after they were sucked into a whirlpool as they battled to stop their children being swept out to sea, an inquest heard.

Dr Uma Ramalingam, 42, and GP Barathi Ravikumar, 40, went to grab the two youngsters after they were suddenly hit by a succession of freak waves as they paddled on rocks near their holiday villa.

But as they did so all four slipped on the wet rocks and slid into the water and were swept out due to the strong waves and currents.

Tragic: Dr Uma Ramalingam a consultant obstetrician from Altrincham in Cheshire, drowned at the Playa Paraiso resort, Tenerife after trying to rescue two children from a succession of freak waves

Scene: The group of four were washed out to sea after a large wave knocked them from a rock on this beach. The two children, aged 10 and 14 at the time, were safely pulled from the water

The children were rescued but Dr Ramalingam, a consultant obstetrician, from Bowdon, Cheshire and Dr Ravikumar, a well-respected family doctor, drowned.

An inquest in Stockport yesterday was told there had been no warning signs about paddling on the rocks at the time of the tragedy in April this year.

The two female doctors were among four families, including five children aged between five and 13, who were holidaying in the popular Playa Paraiso resort in Tenerife.

Initially the families spent the first couple of days relaxing around the family villa and spending time around the pool.

But disaster struck on the second day of the holiday when the women and children went for a stroll along the beach whilst their husbands or partners went shopping in preparation for a barbecue that evening.

In a statement, Dr Ravikumar’s twin sister Dr Poorami Chandrasekaran said the group had set out exploring around 5.30pm and initially had no intention of going in the water.

Victim: Dr Ramalingam (pictured) was a consultant obstetrician. Reports at the time said her husband, Palanichamy Chandra, a 49-year-old consultant gastroenterologist, dived in after them but could only save their ten-year-old son Hari

The inquest heard the group had clambered onto some rocks and had made their way to a large plateau area near to the water’s edge.

Dr Chandrasekaran said there were no warning signs or flags and the children were playing, letting the waves lap at their feet as their mothers took photos.

She said one of the other women in the group, Dr Indu Sivanandan had stayed further back on the rocks as she was frightened of water.

The doctor told the inquest that rocks behind the group were wet which indicated a wave had passed behind them and after taking photos they had decided to make tracks.

Rocky: The two doctors were on the second day of their holiday in Tenerife among four families, including five children, when the incident took place 

No warning: The inquest in Stockport heard there were no warning signs or flags telling people not to swim and that the children were playing, letting the waves lap at their feet as their mothers took photos.

But, she said, just as the group was ready to leave, a ‘very large’ wave came and hit them at knee height, causing them to lose balance.

The adults tried to grab the children but another powerful wave crashed into the shore and the current dragged both the adults and children into the sea.

A third wave followed causing a whirlpool current next to Dr Chandrasekaran and she said there was nothing to hold on to and they were unable to swim against the current.

Unable to see her son or daughter, she managed to see her sister, Dr Ravikumar, struggling in the water some distance away and the next thing she remembered was the coastguards arriving in diving equipment.

She said: ‘It felt a very long time to me but I had no idea. Straight away I told him my sister was there. I couldn’t understand what he was saying. The second diver came and joined the first one.’

Location: The families were staying at Playa Paraiso in south west Tenerife. The resort is about five miles west of the popular Playa de las Americas complex

Dr Chandrasekaran had to be taken to hospital for exhaustion and her 13-year old daughter who is diabetic was also treated for cuts and bruising.

She was then told that both her sister and her friend, Dr Ramalingam, had not been saved and had drowned in the horrific accident.

Reports at the time said Dr Ramalingam’s husband, Palanichamy Chandra, a 49-year-old consultant gastroenterologist, dived in after them but could only save their ten-year-old son Hari.

Post mortem examinations confirmed that both the South Indian-born doctors had died from asphyxia due to drowning.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner John Pollard said: ‘If death had occurred at a British resort I would be writing to the resort about warning signs. It was quite clearly a calm day, with nothing unusual. It was completely unexpected.’

He added that he would write a letter to the Tenerife authorities to bring the case to their attention but would be unable to send a Regulation 28 report because the incident had happened outside the jurisdiction.

Dr Ramalingam suffered tragedy seven years ago when her first husband, Dr Kannan Palaniswamy, 35, was killed in a car crash near the Dundee hospital where they both worked.
