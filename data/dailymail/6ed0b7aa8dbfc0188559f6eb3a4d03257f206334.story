Glass panels that were installed on Paris' Pont des Arts bridge to stop tourists attaching 'lovelocks' to the railings have been scrawled with graffiti.

Viewed as an apparent protest against city officials preventing the craze from continuing, interestingly it was Spanish words that were used on the panels.

The word 'Preciosa', or 'beautiful' in Spanish was spray painted on the glass.

Preciosa, which means beautiful in Spanish, has been daubed on the bridge's glass panels

The group who are campaigning for the end of 'lovelocks' believe this kind of act only strengthens their case

The glass panels have been in place since September, but now graffiti 'artists' have left their mark on them

Locals and expats had started a 'No Love Locks' campaign on Facebook to force the authorities into action, as they believed the padlocking was getting out of control.

Amorous couples would attach a lock to the bridge as a sign of their love, and then throw the key into the River Seine. 

Writing on their page regarding the graffiti incident, 'No Love Locks' said: 'New glass panels on the PDA are badly tagged today. Almost as if to mock the city it says, "preciosa" (lovely/beautiful). Looks more "feo" (ugly) from where we're standing. Or how about, "violento?"

'Is there no respect for Paris anymore? Proof that "love locks" breed more vandalism. ‪#‎banlovelocks‬.' 

The locks are strapped to the railings by couples in love who then toss the key into the River Seine

Protests from people living in Paris urged authorities to halt the tradition of 'lovelocks'

Other comments on the Facebook page liken the iconic bridge to looking more like a New York City subway, while others believe the answer is to install CCTV to catch wrongdoers. 

There are plans to add a third see-through panel and expand the experiment to other bridges as the French capital cracks down on ‘visual pollution’ and attempts to make the blighted bridges safer after a panel of the Pont des Arts bridge collapsed under the weight of the metal last year.

Pont des Arts, a little footbridge over the River Seine, is one of the city’s best-known symbols of romance thanks to the ‘love locks’, but it has been said it is at risk of losing its identity as its metal fencing is replaced with glass panels.

This would satisfy Paris officials and residents, who have long bemoaned the tradition of attaching a padlock as a symbol of undying love and tossing the key in the river.

The locks strapped onto the rails caused part of the bridge to collapse into the River Seine

Paris Deputy Mayor Bruno Julliard told Le Parisien: ‘Paris is the capital of love, we are all very proud of that, but there are more beautiful ways of showing that love than by putting padlocks on a bridge.’

He said the locks are a costly hazard because they are damaging the city’s bridges and jeopardising visitors’ safety due to the added weight.

In June, part of Pont des Arts’ railing collapsed under the weight of the locks, forcing police to close the iconic structure while repairs were made.

It is estimated there are over 700,000 padlocks attached to the bridge, with each grill weighing 500kg.  

Earlier this year, two American writers who live in Paris launched a ‘No Love Locks’ campaign

The metal bridge was originally completed in 1804 but it had to be rebuilt in the 1980s due to damage caused by aerial bombings during the First and Second World Wars.
