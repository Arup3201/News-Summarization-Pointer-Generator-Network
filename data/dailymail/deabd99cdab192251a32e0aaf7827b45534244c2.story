Justin Starr, a Polk County detective, reportedly recorded Townsend’s confession, but then left the recorder on a desk.

Townsend allegedly grabbed it, hid it in his armpit and then asked to use the bathroom, where he flushed it down the toilet.

When Starr looked for the recorder, Townsend allegedly mocked him by saying, ‘Tighten up on your job, homie,’ an arrest affidavit states.
