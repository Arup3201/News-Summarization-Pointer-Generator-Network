Passenger satisfaction with Britain’s crowded, late-running and over-priced railway network has plummeted to the lowest level in six years, a damning new survey by official watchdogs reveals.

One in eight passengers are unhappy with their unreliable rail services at a time of inflation-busting fare rises and bumper bonuses for rail bosses.

Only four out of ten - 42 per cent - believe train companies give value for money while just 38 per cent are satisfied with their ability to deal with delays.

The report by consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said rail companies are ‘failing to deliver on their basic promises’ to deliver a reliable time-table and that train travellers deserved a better deal.

Delays: Passenger anger at delayed train services and rocketing ticket prices is at its highest level in six years

Train bosses admitted there was ‘room for improvement’ while ministers said they ‘share passengers' concerns over punctuality.’

Nationally, just 78 per cent of passengers are satisfied with punctuality and reliability of their train services – down three per cent since spring 2012. 

It is the highest level of passenger dissatisfaction with rail networks in six years since 2007 when just 77 per cent of passengers were happy with punctuality.

Commuters in London and the South East are the most unhappy with punctuality with only three-quarters - 76 per cent- satisfied, compared to 83 per cent on long-distance routes and 81 per cent on regional services.

The damning Passenger Focus report showed that just 42 per cent of passengers believe their train journey provides ‘value for money’, with the figure dropping to 38 per cent on London and south east England services.

Survey results: The majority of passengers surveyed by Passenger Focus said the reliability of their train service and they way rail companies deal with delays is the biggest problem

But on one of the worst performing lines, Greater Anglia's Stansted Express route, five
out of six passengers said it fails to give value for money. Only 17 
per cent of passengers rated their ticket's value for money as being 
satisfactory or good.

By contrast, as many as 76 per cent 
of Grand Central passengers rated the company's London to Bradford 
service as satisfactory or good in the value-for-money category.

Nationally, the percentage of passengers satisfied with their journey overall was 82 per cent compared with 83 per cent in a similar survey in spring 2012, while the figure in an autumn 2012 survey was 85 per cent.

The lowest-scoring operators for overall
satisfaction in the latest survey were Northern and First Capital 
Connect which both had figures of 76 per cent. The highest-scoring 
company was First Hull Trains with 95 per cent.

Unhappy: Overall satisfaction on individual routes around the UK varied between 62 and 95 per cent

Earlier this month the Office of Rail Regulation revealed that millions of passengers are being failed by delayed and cancelled trains because Network Rail missed all of its punctuality targets across England and Wales.

Passenger
Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ‘Passengers faced variable 
performance in the early part of 2013. There continues to be a wide gap 
between the better and weaker performing services - satisfaction with 
individual operators ranges from 76 per cent to 95 per cent.'

He added: ‘Value for money by route is even more striking, with satisfaction levels ranging from 17 per cent  to 76 per cent.

Mr
Smith added: ‘Passengers are now the main overall funder of Great 
Britain's railway, so it is vital that their key needs are met.

‘Given
that performance is the key factor that underpins most passengers' 
general view of the railway, train companies and Network Rail must keep 
striving to get more trains on time.’

Passenger
Focus said rail users had faced performance issues caused by poor 
weather, track and signalling problems, suicides and congestion on the 
network but that it was ‘day to day’ performance that was giving cause 
for concern.

It added that on a positive note, cable theft has become much rarer following crackdowns.

Overall satisfaction by individual routes within train companies' areas varied between 62 per cent and 95 per cent.

On
value for money, the proportion of passengers satisfied with value for 
money for the price of their ticket was 42 per cent - the same as in spring 
2012.

On overcrowding, 
satisfaction with sufficient room for all passengers to sit or stand fell 
from 69 per cent in spring 2012 to 67 per cent in spring 2013.

Over-crowding: Overall 33 per cent of passengers are unhappy with the level of over-crowding on their rail network

Office
of Rail Regulation chairman Anna Walker said: ‘It is very disappointing
that passenger satisfaction with punctuality and reliability has 
fallen.

'While some passengers
enjoy excellent performance, others suffer significant delays and 
disruptions. The range of satisfaction is between 95 per cent and 55 per cent. All 
passengers need reliable services. That is why we have set more 
stretching targets for the next five years. Nine out of ten trains on 
time needs to be the minimum standard.'

In some areas, passengers were happier than in spring last year.

Satisfaction
with station facilities and services rose from 50 per cent to 55 per cent, while 
satisfaction with station cleanliness was up 3 per cent at 74 per cent.

Satisfaction
with station upkeep and repair increased two percentage points to 70 per cent and
satisfaction with connections with other forms of public transport also
rose two per cent to 75 per cent.

David
Mapp, commercial director at the Association of Train Operating 
Companies, said: ‘Train companies know that to be successful they must 
meet the needs of passengers and deliver high levels of satisfaction and
value for money.

‘While these
results show that there is room for improvement, passengers are voting 
with their feet and taking more journeys than at any time since the 
1920s on newer trains, with more services arriving punctually.’

Rail
Minister Norman Baker said: ‘While passenger satisfaction remains 
generally high, I share passengers' concerns over punctuality. The 
Government is investing record amounts into upgrading the railways, and 
the industry must make sure that investment translates into improvements
on the ground.’

He added: ‘I 
recognise there are areas where satisfaction is low such as fares, 
which is why we are currently undertaking a review of fares and 
ticketing so we can start to end the era of above-inflation fare rises.’

Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'These appalling figures on passenger satisfaction show clearly that the travelling public is sick and tired of paying through the nose to travel on crowded, unreliable trains while the private operating companies are raking in a fortune in profits.’

Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: "Passengers have every reason to be dissatisfied when rail fares are going up by as much as 9% a year while delayed and cancelled trains are on the rise.’

She added:’Only last month, rail bosses awarded themselves bonuses on the basis of what they claimed was rising passenger satisfaction, yet these latest figures must surely call those payments into question.’

‘Ministers should now urgently work with the rail regulator to require a change to Network Rail's remuneration scheme so that only actual improvements in performance that benefit passengers are rewarded.’

Richard Hebditch, campaigns director for the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘Passengers are unhappy about the value they get for their tickets. With the review of fares due, now is the time for Government to end above-inflation ticket price hikes.’

The Passenger Focus Spring survey
report was based on feedback from more 30,000 passengers on 30 
specific aspects of their train service.

The survey showed:
