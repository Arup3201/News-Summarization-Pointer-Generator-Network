Rapper Chief Keef left a juvenile detention center today after serving a 60-day sentence for violating his probation for a gun conviction.

The 17-year-old was greeted by two dozen relatives and friends as he left the Cook County Juvenile Justice Center yesterday.

'He's done. He's free to move on with his career,' his lawyer Dennis Berkson told the Chicago Tribune.

Cozart left Cook County Juvenile Court after a brief hearing. Officials say there are no court restrictions on his activities and a judge terminated his probation.

The 17-year-old was sentenced last year to 18 months' probation after his conviction on aggravated unlawful use of a weapon charges for pointing a gun at police officers.

In January, Cook County Juvenile Court Judge Carl Anthony Walker ordered Cozart's arrest for a promotional video that showed the teen firing a semi-automatic rifle at a New York gun range.

The rapper's baby daughter was handed to him and he planted a kiss on her before getting into an SUV without speaking to reporters.

An officer came out of the center with a plastic bag of notebooks beforehand, which he handed over to Cozart's uncle.

Cozart is said to be performing at the SXSW industry showcase in Texas this weekend.

Yesterday his team released a video to accompany the track Now It's Over.
