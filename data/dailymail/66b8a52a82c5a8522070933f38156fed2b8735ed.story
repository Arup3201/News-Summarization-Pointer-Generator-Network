Love affairs between musicians and models are a common occurrence in the showbiz world.

But 24-year-old Chinese pop star Zhang Muyi has caused controversy after publicly declaring his love for a baby-faced model who is just 12-years-old.

Despite the fact that Canada-based Akama Miki is not yet in her teens, the pair have exchanged romantic messages on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social networking site.

Muyi, who is said to have been hired as the model's music coach when she was eight-years-old, replied: 'I simply can't wait for these next four birthdays of yours to pass, I'm counting down each one.'

'All we can do is continue to persevere with our love, our life, and being together.'
