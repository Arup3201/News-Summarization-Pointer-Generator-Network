She might have missed out on the traditional breakfast of Three Kings cake but Queen Letizia of Spain appeared to be enjoying her early start as she watched a military parade in Madrid.

The parade, which was combined with a reception at the Palacio Real, was held to mark Epiphany - a national holiday in Spain.

Dressed in a floor-length teal gown, the 42-year-old was all smiles as she was helped onto a red carpeted viewing platform ahead of proceedings.

With husband King Felipe, 46, by her side, she then stood to watch the procession before retreating back inside the palace to welcome Juan del Rio Martin, the Military Archbishop of Spain.

The priest, 68, has held the ceremonial role, which is similar to that of a British army chaplain, since 2000, when Benedict XVI appointed him to the position.

Madrid's Epiphany Day parade is an annual tradition and is part of a day of celebration that sees the whole country come to a standstill.

Considered almost as important as Christmas Day itself, Epiphany marks the moment when baby Jesus, then just a few days old, was seen for the first time by the Magi or Three Kings. 

Big day: Epiphany is almost as important as Christmas in Spain and most towns stage a parade

Ceremony: After the parade, the couple returned to the Palacio Real for more Epiphany celebrations

Known in Spain as El Día de los Reyes (Day of the Kings), it is celebrated with presents and colourful parades, the oldest of which takes place in Valencia.

The biggest and most important, however, is Madrid's - thanks in no small part to the presence of a real king at the procession.

This year's is Felipe's first since becoming king in June 2014 and follows a turbulent Christmas period for the Spanish royals.

On the 20th December, it was announced that Felipe's older sister Infanta Cristina, 49, would go on trial for tax crimes.

Turbulent: The Spanish royals have endured a difficult Christmas period thanks to Infanta Cristina

Speech: 46-year-old King Felipe used the occasion to make a speech 

Along with her husband, former handball player, Iñaki Urdangarín, the 49-year-old princess is one of 17 people charged with misusing funds donated to Mr Urdangardin's charity, the Noos Foundation.

As a result, Cristina has been asked to keep a low profile, has not been allowed to undertake royal duties since 2011 and was conspicuous by her absence at Felipe's coronation.

If convicted, which would be a first for Spain's royal family, she could face up to four years in prison as well as a multi-million pound fine. 

While Felipe and Letizia remain popular, the incident has led to the introduction of new rules designed to prevent a repeat of both the current scandal and the last two to affect his family - King Juan-Carlos' love of a freebie and the infamous 2009 photo in which he was pictured standing over an elephant he had shot.

The rules, which also apply to Letizia and his two daughters, came into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'.

Along with banning freebies, royals will be prevented from working in the private sector and all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.'

Looking good: Letizia looked fresh-faced and relaxed following the Christmas break

Difficult times: The 46-year-old's older sister Cristina is set to stand trial on tax fraud charges later this year

New rules: As a result, Felipe has been forced to introduce new rules on royal behaviour

Dignity: Royals are now expected to behave in ways that earn them citizens' trust and appreciation

First time: The event is the first that Felipe has overseen since taking the throne in June last year
