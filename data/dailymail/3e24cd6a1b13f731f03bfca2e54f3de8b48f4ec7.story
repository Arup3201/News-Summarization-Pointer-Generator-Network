A university student kissed his girlfriend goodbye before jumping to his death on the morning of an exam, an inquest heard.

Mystery surrounds the reason why 'happy' Max Witkowski, 23, died after leaping more than 60ft from a window.

A coroner feared Max had a one-off 'psychotic episode' which made jump from the university window for no obvious reason.

Couple: Girlfriend Joanne Davies, pictured with Max, told the inquest how the business management student kissed her goodbye on the morning of his death as he was rushing around the house before his exam

Girlfriend Joanne Davies told the inquest how business management student Max kissed her goodbye on the morning of his death.

She said: 'The last time I saw him he was rushing around the house before his exam, like a typical boy.

'I was forcing breakfast down him. He gave me a kiss and said goodbye but it wasn’t a lingering kiss like it was the last time.

'I had made him lunch. He was going to come back for it and I was waiting for him.

'The exam hall was three quarters of a mile from where he died. He had no reason to be there.'

'The only time we spent apart was when I was working.'

In a note he wrote just before he jumped he told his family and girlfriend they had nothing to do with his death.

But the reason why Mr Witkowski jumped out of the Cardiff Business School remains a mystery.

The inquest heard his exams had gone well in the weeks leading up to his death and he had no personal problems anyone knew of.

In the note he said: 'Not the fault of parents, Lee (sister) or Joe (girlfriend) I promise, sorry.'

Mr Witkowski, of Guildford, Surrey, was in his second year of a business management degree at Cardiff University when he died last May.

He was described as a 'calm and mellow' person who 'thought everything through'.

Mr Witkowski jumped from Cardiff Business School university building on the morning he was supposed to be in an exam.

He was found unconscious on the road beneath the building.

Cardiff coroner Mary Hassel said the reason for Mr Witkowski’s death remained a mystery.

She said: 'The picture I have is of someone who wasn’t just not depressed but was happy.

'He was doing fine in his exams and was in a relationship and looking forward to going on holiday.

'On the day of his death Max was on his own and seen pacing around the revision room and then, although no one saw him leave the window, he must have jumped.

'But I have to be sure of the evidence.

'It is a very unusual in my experience for their not to be at least one piece of evidence that the deceased was considering taking their own life.

'There simply isn’t any shred of evidence anywhere.'

Ms Hassel said a psychotic episode could be responsible for Mr Witkowski’s mysterious death.

She said: 'Sometimes people in Max’s age group will have an epsiode for the first time in their lives and that can be the first sign that something may be wrong.

'I don’t know if this happened but I see it as a possibility.'

She recorded an open verdict.
