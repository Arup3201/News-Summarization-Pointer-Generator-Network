The safety pin which was found lodged inside the 500g block of cheese

An Australian man bit off far more than he could chew recently when he sunk his teeth into a safety pin lodged inside a block of cheddar cheese.

Patrick McMullen, 59, was casually cutting a slice of Woolworths-brand cheese on Wednesday night when to his 'horror' he felt a small pin-prick inside the roof of his mouth.

Initially mistaking the pain for a self-inflicted cracked tooth, Mr McMullen soon realised something far more sinister was the reason why he opted to spit the half-eaten slice - and the safety pin inside - onto the kitchen table.

'It was Wednesday evening and I'd cut off a slice of the blocked cheese and found something unusual in my mouth,' he said. 'I thought I'd cracked a tooth, but when I spat out the cheese  I saw a safety pin inside.'

The Orange Woolworths in NSW where the block of cheese was bought from

Although not cracking a tooth, Mr McMullen did say the pin aggravated a filling he had in one of his top teeth and that he would more than likely require a visit to the dentist to have it replaced.

The Woolworths Homebrand 500g variety of cheese was bought from the Orange Woolworths in north west NSW where Mr McMullen, a retired school teacher, regularly shops.

Obviously shaken he told Daily Mail Australia he was pleased with how his complaint was handled but spent a large majority of the next day talking with Woolworths.

He said he spent most of Thursday morning negotiating on the phone with a spokesperson about the prevalence of these issues.

He said he 'pressured them to withdraw the product from all Woolworths [stores] in Australia,' which a spokesperson has since confirmed the company has done.

He said all existing stock had been removed from Woolworths shelves.

'Woolworths immediately withdrew the product from sale,' the spokesperson told the ABC.

'Woolworths is continuing to investigate the issue and has been in touch with the customer a number of times.'

He said while he felt his own safety was compromised on this occasion there was a much broader issue at stake - the safety of children.

'A child could easily have swallowed that (safety pin) and that was my biggest concern,' he said.

'That's why I have spoken out on this issue.'

A spokesperson for Devondale Murray Goulburn (MG) said the company takes safety matters 'very seriously' and the incident is being investigated.

'MG has very stringent food safety processes in place throughout our supply chain,' the spokesperson said.

He said all products are subject to X-Ray and metal detection processes.

'The investigation into this incident is still underway, and we'll be keeping the customer and Woolworths up-to-date as it progresses, and until we have finalised this important process.'
