Peter Moores has emerged as a leading candidate to make a shock return to the helm of the England cricket team by replacing Andy Flower as coach.

Moores, sacked by England five years ago after Kevin Pietersen’s attempt to oust him, has rebuilt his reputation at Lancashire as one of the best coaches in the domestic game.

Sportsmail understands he would love to have a second crack at the biggest job in English cricket and the ECB, who feel he was hard done by last time, will seriously consider his claims when they begin interviewing later this month.

Return? Moores, who was England coach between 2007 and 2009, is in line to replace Andy Flower

Moores, whose methods did alienate some senior players other than Pietersen, is particularly adept at working with emerging talent which may add to his claims of landing a job with a ‘new’ England team.

Ashley Giles, who has enhanced his claims on the top job by backing the decision to sack Pieteren, remains the hot favourite and would be a popular choice among players who have enjoyed working with him in one-day cricket.

Paul Collingwood, cutting his coaching teeth with Scotland, looks sure to feature in England’s new coaching team, either as Giles' assistant if the one-day supremo lands the job or possibly as batting coach.

But the strong support within the team and the ECB for Giles will not stop England advertising the job next week, with managing director Paul Downton using head hunters in an attempt to attract the biggest names in world coaching.

It seems increasingly likely that Downton will not be able to consider the outstanding candidate for the job in Gary Kirsten, who again distanced himself from the England job on Friday.

‘It would have been a great challenge,’ the former India and South Africa coach told Sky Sports. ‘It’s a pressurised role and I think over many years Andy Flower did an exceptional job. I had many chats with Andy and I enjoyed his way.

‘I have often wondered if I could go in there with my coaching philosophies and seeing if it could work in that environment. I would have enjoyed that challenge. But I’m taking on an IPL team in Delhi Daredevils – thank goodness it’s for a shorter spell of time – and I’m really looking forward to it.’

Yet, as Martin Samuel pointed out in these pages earlier in the week, Kirsten did not actually say no and if Downton decides that he really is the exceptional candidate then it would be intriguing to see what would happen if the ECB threw money at him.

Moores the merrier: The coach, stood in front of the old Old Trafford pavilion in 2009, has restored his reputation

Peter Moores's Test record as England coach:

Played 22 won 8 lost 6 drawn 8

Series won: 3 (out of 7)

Kirsten earns £300,000 for just six weeks with Delhi and works as a batting consultant for his native South Africa for 50 days a year from his Cape Town home.

It is a lifestyle he wanted after becoming disillusioned with the daily treadmill of life on the road and, with England now convinced they must have one job in the role across all forms, Downton would clearly have some serious persuading to do to land Kirsten.

As it is good performances on the one-day tour of West Indies and the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh could seal the job for Giles while a former England coach in Moores waits patiently in the wings.

England also hope to fill the vacancy on their selection panel next week with John Emburey a leading candidate. Another Middlesex man in Angus Fraser would be hotly fancied should England decide that, as with Giles, there is no conflict of interest in being attached to a county and be a selector.
