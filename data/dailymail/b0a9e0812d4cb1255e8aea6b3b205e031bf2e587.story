It's an age old tradition on the streets of Catalonia in Spain, but not one that the average Londoner expects to see on their lunch break.

More than 170 members of the Human Towers de Vilafranca team clambered on top of one another to make their UK debut this afternoon in an attempt to build a living structure to rival Tower Bridge.

Not a hobby likely to endear itself to health and safety officials, the stunt saw members of the team - men, women and children of all ages and sizes - climb barefoot on the shoulders of their colleagues reaching higher and higher.

Going up: Members of the team form successively smaller tiers by climbing up the bodies of each layer to mount the shoulders of the previous tier until the tower is complete

Sometimes the towers collapse, but on this occasion the final member of the team managed to reach the pinnacle and triumphantly raise a fist in the air.

The tradition of building human towers, known as Castells has been a popular custom in Spain for more than 300 years and is a mainstay of summer festivals around the Mediterranean, most specifically in Barcelona and the Catalonia area.

The bizarre pastime has its roots in aerial dance moves performed at religious festivals centuries ago.

It originated in Valis, near the city of Tarragona, in the southern part of Catalonia in the 18th century and spread throughout the region in the years that followed.

The base of the living structure, known as the Pinya, is usually made up of four men who act as a form of safety net and cushion the fall of those above them if things go wrong.

Those who are part of the Pinya have to be strong - they can sometimes bear 770lbs on their shoulders. Castellers, as they are known, then form other levels and the top level is complete when the final climber, usually a small shild known as the enxaneta, reaches their position and puts one hand in the air.

Stages of assembly and disassembly should by completed without stopping.

Towers can reach up to 10 levels high.

The practice was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage by Unesco in 2010 and teams compete at competitions between April and September each year.

The tradition is kept alive by some 7,000 castellers who belong to 66 different teams.

As well as performing close to London Bridge, the Human Towers de Vilafranca team also showcased their talents in Moorgate and will perform at Clapham Common, the Millennium Bridge in Southwark and Borough Market throughout the weekend.

The group performed their daring stunt on top of a building in Manhattan last summer to commemorate the ongoing rebuilding of the World Trade Center.
