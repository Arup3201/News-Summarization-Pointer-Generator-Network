Stache the cat may only be ten months old, but the distinctive-looking pet already looks set for a  career as a celebrity lookalike.

Thanks to an unusual facial marking, the Oriental shorthair has been compared to scores of (moustachioed) stars, including fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. 

It has also been compared to the likes of Adrien Brody, Tom Selleck and even Snoop Dog.

Owner Christine Gonzalez brought Stache home when he was seven months old and says he was very shy, but he has since turned into a confident boy.

She said the cat's prominent black marking above his lip - which makes it look like he has a distinguished moustache - left her with no other choice but to name him Stache.

Stache now lives with Christine and her 16-year-old tabby cat Romeo at her home in New Jersey.

He has already earned a social media following on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, which is where his fans first noticed that the cat bore more than a passing resemblance to Magnum P.I. star Selleck.

Since then the celebrity comparisons have been pouring in, with the quirky cat being likened to Jack Black, Scott Disick, Jim Carey and Will Ferrell, to name just a few.

Stache himself doesn't appear to be too fazed by the celebrity comparisons and spends his days playing at home, snoozing with feline pal Romeo and doing the odd interview.
