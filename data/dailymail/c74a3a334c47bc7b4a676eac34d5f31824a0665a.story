When nobleman Sir Nicholas Moseley built Moseley Old Hall in Cheadle, Cheshire, in the 1660s, it was not only the most desirable dwelling in the vicinity – it was pretty much the only one.

Miles of open fields stretched out from the house in all directions, dotted with only the odd farm dwelling.

Back then, Manchester was a  small weaving town miles away. Fast-forward 400 years and the urban sprawl of Greater Manchester has engulfed what had been countryside right up to the doorstep of this grand old manor house.

Manor home: Moseley Old Hall in Cheadle, Cheshire, was built in the 1660s and now stands rather majestically in a cul-de-sac of modern housing

Moseley Old Hall now stands rather majestically in a cul-de-sac of modern housing after what remaining land that belonged to the house was sold by a developer in the early 1980s. The five-bedroom, four-reception room house is now on the market  for £375,000 after its owner, businessman Leon Mazurek, died in 2011. It has been left to his brothers Tad and Jan to sell the property.

This, as Tad admits, is not a straightforward task. While Moseley Old Hall may be steeped in history – Bonnie Prince Charlie is believed to have stayed in the house during the Jacobite rebellion of the 1740s – it is not to everyone’s taste.

For a start, the house will need a substantial renovation to render it fit for what most would consider modern living. Leon Mazurek not only avoided updating it – he positively revelled in its period charms, keeping its primitive central heating system and filling it with old furniture and artworks.

So Tad and Jan have opted to sell this historic property using the modern method – an internet estate agent, emoov.co.uk.

‘It can be difficult selling a house like this as it requires a very niche buyer,’ says Tad. ‘We wanted to spread our net as wide as possible  to find one.

‘The trouble with going to a local 
estate agent is that everyone around Cheadle knows about this property 
as it’s the oldest and possibly the most famous for miles around.’

Russell
 Quirk of emoov.co.uk, which launched in 2010 with a grant from Dragons’
 Den’s James Caan, believes his company is ideal for vendors such as the
 Mazureks. ‘We guarantee extensive coverage both nationally and 
internationally so they have certainly spread the net with us in their 
search for that niche buyer.

‘The
 difference between us and traditional local estate agents is that 
properties with us will appear on all of the property-search websites – 
Zoopla, Prime Location, Right Move, the lot. Most traditional agents put
 their properties on only one and spend the rest of their marketing 
money on advertising in local newspapers. What’s more, I can afford  to 
spend more on marketing as I don’t have to spend money on high street 
premises as traditional agents do – we have two offices to cater for our
 entire operation.’

These 
lower overheads also offer an attractive bonus for vendors using 
emoov.co.uk. Rather  than charging people selling a percentage of the 
property’s sale price, emoov charges a flat fee of £395 plus VAT, 
whatever the price.

Quirk 
says the firm recently facilitated the sale of a property in London’s 
fashionable Belsize Park for £3.15 million but the vendors paid only 
£395 plus VAT.

There is one drawback – emoov does not send representatives to oversee viewings of properties. The vendors must show prospective buyers around themselves. It does, however, offer mortgage advice, conveyancing referrals and information on the local area around properties for sale.

Tad Mazurek is more than happy to do the viewings of Moseley Old Hall. He is particularly keen to point out the features of greatest historical interest, such as the chunky original lock and key in the original timber back door, which he gleefully demonstrates is still in fine working order.

Inscriptions dating from the house’s early days in the 1660s on a flagstone in the garden and on an oak beam above the front door also catch the eye. And Tad enthuses about a supposed secret passage from the house to a local church – though neither  he nor his brother has discovered  its whereabouts.

Upstairs, via the original solid-oak staircase, Tad points out the only room his brother modernised: the bathroom. But since this work looks likely to have been carried out soon after Leon Mazurek bought the house for £120,000 in 1992, new owners  will probably want this room redecorated first, as it looks simply dated rather than historical.

Tad stresses that though the house is Grade II listed, new owners can change anything as long as it does not alter the structure of the property. Certain areas of the ceiling on the upper floor will require immediate attention, and even those wishing  to maintain the historical spirit of  the house will undoubtedly want to modernise the kitchen.

With its low ceilings, original oak beams, solid internal doors and leaded windows, Moseley Old Hall will appeal to someone – but they  will have to have a taste for the historical without requiring the services of a traditional estate agent.
