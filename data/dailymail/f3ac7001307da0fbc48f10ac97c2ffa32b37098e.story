With his tweed deerstalker hat and capacious line in overcoats, Sherlock Holmes isn't the most obvious of style icons.

But according to photographer Kasia Wozniak, that's precisely what Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictional detective is.

Now, she has created a photo series entitled He Wasn't An Easy Gentleman to Describe, which takes as its starting point quotes found in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

Recreation: Vivienne Westwood Gold Label, Maison Martin Margiela and Ed Lee contributed to these looks

Unlikely style icon: Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes is better known for his tweed deerstalker hats

The photos, which go on display at the Museum of London this week, were created with the help of Vivienne Westwood and Maison Martin Margiela, as well as recent graduates, Anna Bezgubenko, Charlotte Chan and Ed Lee.

'I have long been inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle’s ‘The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes’ and I couldn’t resist the chance to create a new and timeless fashion fantasy, using these as a springboard,' explains Wozniak.

'My photography is an incredibly manual process and uses a great deal of chemistry – almost alchemy. 

'While mixing the chemical solutions needed to take my wet-plate photographs and developing in my dark room, I felt a great affinity with Sherlock Holmes. He often spends his days at the chemical laboratory too.'

Eccentric: These Anna Bezgubenko and Craig Green looks were inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's novels

In the photographs, which were styled by John William, Conan Doyle’s line: 'Don’t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you…?' from The Sign of Four manifests itself in a knitted jumper that once belonged to a boxing instructor and pair of tie-dye shorts by designer, Craig Green. 

Meanwhile, Sherlock’s experiments in medical laboratories are referenced in pieces from Anna Bezgubkenko’s AW14, which was inspired by the protective clothing worn by dissectors and medical students in the 1890s.

More inspiration still comes from lines in, The Hound of the Baskervilles, A Study In Scarlet and The Valley of Fear, with Vivienne Westwood providing a cape to recreate the line: 'He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket…' from The Sign of Four.

The result is eccentric, with each of the eight photographs bearing a striking resemblance to the ensembles sported by the modern denizens of the trendy East End.

Traditional: Ms Wozniak uses a century-old method of photography called the wet plate collodion process

Curator Beatrice Behlen is not surprised. 'The streets of London are catwalks for parading individual style.

'Some outfits are easy to decode; while others are more difficult to read. Some appearances can be deceptive. 

'Kasia’s photographic narrative catalogues a fantastical wardrobe for living and lounging in the city through the collections of established designers and recent London fashion graduates. I wonder what Mr Holmes would have made of it all?'

The series is part of a major Sherlock exhibition at the Museum of London, which opens on the 17th October and delves into the impact Doyle's creation has had on the capital.
