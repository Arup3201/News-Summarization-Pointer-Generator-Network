Accused: Mirella Dzioba, 33 has been arrested and placed on $10,000 bond for trying to extort $250,000 from a wealthy Detroit businessman

A former model and real estate agent is facing jail time for attempting to extort over $250,000 from a wealthy married Michigan businessman.

Mirella Dzioba, 33, hatched a scheme to blackmail the 61-year-old executive after meeting him at a property sale close in July.

Suggesting the pair went for drinks following the sale, Dzioba came onto the victim and flattered him on a dinner date by suggesting that she 'enjoyed strong men' and encouraged him to speak to her in a sexual manner.

The man, who is named in FBI affidavits only as a 'wealthy businessman in the Detroit metropolitan area', followed the married mother-of-three's lead and 'was also encouraged by Dzioba to subsequently leave several similar voice messages'.

The two agreed to a second date at which Dzioba, 'inquired about the extent of the victim's wealth' and brought him into her confidence by asking him to help her financially with a charity she was running.

After this meeting, the FBI claims that the former model who is of Bosnian descent sent the victim, 'what could fairly be described as suggestive photographs'.

There is no suggestion in the signed affidavit that the couple ever had entered into an intimate relationship.

Extortion: Mirella Dzioba, 33, is facing extortion charges and up to five years in prison for trying to use her feminine charms to take money off the victim after recording their first meeting in a Rochester, Michigan restaurant

Following this, the victim alleges that Dzioba asked him for $1400 so that she could buy a laptop and pay for a real estate training course according to the Smoking Gun.

The businessman did not reply to these text messages, which caused Dzioba to allegedly text, 'O forget it. Seriously, I'm done. Maybe I should call her.' The victim told the FBI that he took 'her' to mean his wife, who was totally unaware of their rendezvous.

However, thinking that he could pay her off, the 61-year-old took $1400 to her offices at real estate agent Larry Williams Homes in August.

However, on taking the cash from the man, Dzioba allegedly informed the man that she needed $250,000 or she would tell his wife.

She told the victim that she had told her husband about his behavior and that he wanted her to get a lawyer involved.

Text messages from her to the victim warn that 'If u think u can shut me up with $1400$ u r mistaken' (sic).

'All u got to do is pay and no one will ever know. Ever'.

It was then that she used a personal attorney to contact the victim with a tape recording of their first restaurant meeting where he spoke in a suggestive manner and the voicemail messages and threatened to contact the media too.

Following this, the victim alleges that he began getting mysterious phone calls from restricted numbers to his home phone and late night phone calls which contained snippets from their first restaurant encounter.

Freaked out by events spiraling out of control, the victim contacted the FBI according to the Smoking Gun.

Under their guidance the victim told her that he would give her only $100,000 delivered in $5,000 installments.

So, last Tuesday, the 61-year-old met Dzioba in a parking lot outside her office and handed her an envelope containing $4,800 in $100 bills.

She threatened him and said that 'The next five needs to be by the end of the week though.'

On Monday, federal agents arrested her on extortion charges which could carry a maximum sentence of five years.

According to her biography on Larry Williams Homes, Dzioba is a mother-of-three and 'loves to do volunteer work and to help others.'

Additionally, she 'has done modeling in her past and is currently doing the news on the radio on weekends.'
