An unusual travel company has started running a safari with a twist by inviting guests to wear their evening best as they survey the wildlife.

The Rovos Rail Safari Train takes passengers through South Africa to admire the landscape and nature - in serious style.

Instead of the usual walking boots and khaki shorts, visitors are asked to dress for dinner in cocktail dresses or jackets and ties.
