Disgraced ex-Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette - who wrote a first hand account of the mission to kill Osama bin Laden - allegedly 'recruited' other fellow SEALs to provide classified information to the makers of popular video game 'Medal of Honor: Warfighter'.

Senior Navy officials confirmed today that seven members of the secretive SEAL Team Six, of which Bissonnette was a member, have been disciplined for providing classified information to Electronic Arts.

Spending two days as paid consultants for the game-makers, the SEALS were punished for the latest embarrassing leak involving the elite special forces unit  with letters of reprimand and forfeited their pay for two months but will not face jail time.

Four other SEALs, all based on the West Coast, are also under investigation for similar alleged violations, one other official said.

Privileged information: Some Navy SEALs are in trouble for showing the creators classified documents

According to CBS News, it was the investigation the military launched into Bissonnette's book - published under the pseudonym Mark Owen - that led the authorities to discover that he had allegedly 'recruited' the 11 Navy SEALS into the video game deal.

'As they were looking into his book deal, the money, whether he violated the non-disclosure agreements he signed ... what they ended up learning is that 11 Navy SEALs had been brought in allegedly by Owen into this deal with a video company for the production of Medal of Honor: Warfighter, a Navy SEALs-based video game,' said CBS Senior Correspondent and former assistant director of National Intelligence John Miller.

This issue raised the same concerns as Bissonnette's book. 'There was no notification of their commanding officer, no waivers signed...none of the boxes had been checked.'

One serious point for U.S. Defense chief's is the possibility that classified information - known as 'Tactics, Techniques and Procedures' or TTPS - can be picked up by Somalia pirates or indeed terrorists just by playing what should be a simple video game.

'What do the warfighters do, what tricks do they use, how do they work?' said Miller.

'I guess if you stretch it there you could say that if you played that video game enough based on real Navy SEALs knowledge, you could learn to counter some of those TTPs.'

The worry for Pentagon chiefs is if the 11 SEALs in total divulged information on equipment and tactics that could be used against the elite fighting force

The popular video game boasts that was 'written by actual U.S. Tier 1 Operators while deployed overseas.'

In fact, according to Miller, the good publicity that came from the succesful bin Laden raid is now backfiring on the elite and secretive unit.

'The special operations community looks on this as too much of a good thing,' said Miller.

'They have run into the Facebook generation - they are used to living out loud, used to talking as individuals. they are used to it being all about me and that's a conflict.'

Each of the seven received a punitive letter of reprimand- which generally prevents individuals from being promoted- and a partial forfeiture of pay for two months.

The deputy commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Garry Bonelli, issued a statement acknowledging that nonjudicial punishments had been handed out for misconduct, but he did not offer any details.

'We do not tolerate deviations from the policies that govern who we are and what we do as sailors in the United States Navy,' Bonelli said.

He alluded to the importance of honoring nondisclosure agreements that SEALs sign.

He said the punishments this week 'send a clear message throughout our force that we are and will be held to a high standard of accountability.'

The two main complaints against the SEALs were that they did not seek the permission of their command to take part in the video game project and that they showed the video designers some of their specially designed combat equipment unique to their unit, said a senior military official.

The official was briefed about the case but was not authorized to speak publicly about it.

In the actual game promotional materials Electronic Arts claimed that it was 'written by actual U.S. Tier 1 Operators while deployed overseas.'

It adds that give 'players a view into globally recognised threats...letting them experience the action as it might have unfolded.'

Tier 1 Operator is a military term for units involved in the most sensitive and classified operations.

While Pentagon officials refused to discuss the exact nature of the information the SEALs allegedly gave away, the leak is just the latest in a series since the May 2nd 2011 bin Laden raid.

Last year the White House itself was involved when the administration was accused of improperly disclosing details of the mission to the New York Times for political gain.

And then infamously, this fall, Pentagon officials began an investigation after the publication of 'No Easy Day' which is a first person account of the bin Laden raid by former SEAL Team Six member, Matt Bissonnette.

Matt Bissonnette, who participated in 
the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, but later retired from the SEALs, published his book under the pseudonym Mark Owen, but he landed 
in hot water with the Pentagon even before it was published in 
September.

The Pentagon 
accused him of disclosing classified information in violation of the 
nondisclosure agreements he had signed as a SEAL. He disputes the 
charge.

compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the 
Situation Room of the White House

While they have not taken any formal action against him, the Pentagon have said they are looking at their legal options.

The SEAL mission to capture or kill Laden, while stunningly successful, encountered a number of unexpected obstacles, including the loss of a stealthy helicopter that was partially blown up by the SEALs after making a hard landing inside bin Laden's compound.

The head of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Sean Pybus, responded to the Bissonnette book by telling his force that 'hawking details about a mission' and selling other information about SEAL training and operations puts the force and their families at risk.

SEALs, both active duty and retired, possess highly sensitive information about tactics and techniques that are central to the success of their secret and often dangerous missions overseas.

That is why they are obliged to sign nondisclosure agreements when they enter service and when they leave, and it is why the Pentagon seeks to enforce such written agreements.

The punishments were first reported by CBS News.
