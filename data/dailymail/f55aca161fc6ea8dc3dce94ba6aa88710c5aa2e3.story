Bacary Sagna will play his final game for Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday after the club refused to meet his £100,000-per-week wage demands.

The right-back has been involved in a long running contract dispute with the club that has seen him turn down three offers - the latest a three year deal worth around £80,000-per-week.

The Gunners board have now informed Sagna that they are unwilling to meet his £5.2million-a-season demands, effectively bringing the curtain down on his Arsenal career.

Waving goodbye: Bacary Sagna, at the Emirates last week, is set to leave Arsenal at the end of the season

His final game will be in Saturday's FA Cup final against Hull.

He will then embark on the task of choosing his next club.

Sagna will be free to discuss a Bosman transfer switch to a rival Premier League club from Saturday night.

Manchester City are interested, while Liverpool and Chelsea could also launch a move.

He already has several offers from abroad, with Galatasaray and Inter Milan among the clubs interested.

Last supper? Sagna enjoyed a meal with his teammates to celebrate Mikel Arteta's wife's birthday last night

The France international is said 
to be relaxed about his future, though his family are settled in England
 which is likely to play a factor in making his decision.

Sagna has grown frustrated at the club's attempts to keep him, feeling the club haven't rewarded him for his loyalty.

He has rejected overtures from Real Madrid and City in recent seasons.
