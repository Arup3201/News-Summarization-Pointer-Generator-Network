Josh Dorgu, 18, died after collapsing in front of fellow pupils during an A-level maths class at Highgate School in north London

A promising 18-year-old schoolboy died after collapsing in front of fellow pupils during an A-level maths class.

Josh Dorgu, 18, suffered a cardiac arrest and staff at Highgate School in north London tried to resuscitate him but failed.

He was taken by ambulance to the Royal Free Hospital where he died with his father, the Rev Karowei Dorgu, vicar of St John The Evangelist Church, and mother Dr Mosun Dorgu, by his side. 

A special service was held in the school's chapel on Wednesday, packed full of Josh's friends, who lit candles in his memory. 

Close family friend Lloyd Milo, a warden at St John's, said: 'Josh was a wonderful boy. He was like a grandson to me and my wife Ann. We have just been at the family's house. They are doing the best they can. People are coming in and out to see them.'

Josh's parents and older brother Timi said prayers for the keen Arsenal fan at the Upper Holloway church on Sunday.

Pupils have created a 'memory board' where they are able to pin notes celebrating their memories of Josh.

One minute of silence was also held before all Highgate sports matches on Saturday in memory of the 18-year-old.

A book of condolence has been opened in the school's chapel for pupils, staff and parents to sign.

Headmaster Adam Pettitt said: 'This is a terrible tragedy for Josh's family, the school and its community.

'Josh was a lively, intelligent young man of strong faith, with an irrepressible gift for making people laugh.' 

Mr Pettitt said: 'The pupils, especially Josh's friends and peers, have conducted themselves magnificently in the face of this terrible news.

'Josh's parents are receiving much warm and expert support from the church community, family, friends and colleagues.

'We know that they are keen to involve his friends and the school in arrangements for his funeral to mark his passing and celebrate his life.

'The thoughts and prayers of the whole Highgate community are with them.'

A school spokeswoman said: 'The exact reasons for his collapse are not yet known, but we understand he was treated for a cardiac incident.' 

One parent who had known Josh for several years described him as the 'kindest child'.

He said schools should invite children to have cardiac screening in order to pick up any undetected heart abnormality.

The parent said in an online message: 'I would hope that, if something good was to come out of this tragedy, it would be that this problem is highlighted in the media and that more teenagers are offered this non-invasive test in all schools.'

A spokesperson for the London Ambulance Service said: 'We were called at 3.26pm to reports of a person unwell at a school in Highgate.

'We sent two responders by car, an ambulance crew and an advanced paramedic to the scene.

'We treated an 18-year-old in cardiac arrest at the scene.He was taken to Royal Free Hospital as a priority.'

A cardiac arrest happens when your heart stops pumping blood around your body.

If someone has suddenly collapsed, is not breathing normally and is unresponsive, they are in cardiac arrest.
