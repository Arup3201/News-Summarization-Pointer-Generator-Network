14 days ago Liam Gallagher called Nicole Appleton to tell her he was accused of fathering a child with another woman.

Since then, the 40-year old rocker has 'not bothered to call' his wife, says her mother Mary.

Speaking to Grazia magazine, the 72-year old said: 'He phoned her the day before it came out and he hasn't been in touch since.'

No communication: Liam Gallagher has reportedly not spoken to his wife since he informed of the love-child allegations two weeks ago

Shocked: Mary Appleton - here with Nicole's father and her husband Kenneth - believes Liam is acting totally out of character

'She can't get hold of him,' Mary told the weekly magazine. 'She's absolutely devastated. This is so out of character for the Liam I know.'

The Beady Eye frontman is said to have denied fathering the seven-month old daughter of Showbiz journalist Liza Ghorbani, who is suing him for £2 million in child support.

But the cheating scandal has left Nicole feeling betrayed and confused by Liam's behaviour, as she continues her holiday in Florida with her sisters Natalie, Lori, Lee, her son Gene, 12, and his 13-year old child Lennon from his marriage to Patsy Kensit.

'Her sisters are supportive but she is in a terrible state,' said Mary.

'It feels like he's been living a double life.'

But the All Saint star's mother doesn't think Liza is the only woman Liam has been unfaithful with.

Only a few days after the scandal broke, Gallagher was seen laughing and joking beside a pool with his bikini-clad personal assistant Debbie Gwyther.

Mary said that Nicole has had it confirmed that the two are together, and therefor has no intention of reconciling with his wife of five years.

But Gallagher's management has allegedly dismissed Gwyther, 31, because of their relationship becoming 'too close.'

Debbie subsequently deleted her Twitter account following the publication of the pictures of her with Liam in Ibiza.

But despite the drama of the situation, Mary would support Nicole's decision to take him back, but at the moment that is the last thing on her daughter's mind.

The British rocker's lawyers are currently pursuing legal action against the New York Post for naming him in the article that exposed the love-child scandal.

Mail Online have contacted all parties for comment.
