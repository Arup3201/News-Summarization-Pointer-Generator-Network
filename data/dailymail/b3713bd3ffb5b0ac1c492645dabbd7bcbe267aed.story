Several business owners in Austin were horrified this week to find large stickers bearing the message 'Exclusively for white people' affixed to their storefronts.

As thousands partied and pitched new technologies at the SXSW festival, staff at an East Austin bakery were wondering who would want to announce to their customers 'Maximum of 5 colored customers/colored BOH staff accepted.'

'As a multiracial family with a multiracial staff, there's nothing funny about this … It's sick,' Olivia Guerra O'Neal, owner of Sugar Mama's Bakeshop, told KXAN. 'We are disgusted by this act of vandalism and cowardice.'

Shocking: These stickers appeared overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday on the storefronts of at least six Austin, Texas businesses

The stickers also appeared during the night between Tuesday and Wednesday on a Mexican restaurant, clothing store, bicycle shop and others.

The glossy stickers also feature what looks like an official City of Austin seal and the message 'sponsored by the City of Austin Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program.'

But Austin Mayor Steve Adler wants the world to know his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers.

'This is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city. Austin condemns this type of hurtful behavior. Our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul. We will keep it that way,' Adler said in a statement.

While  Austin appears to agree the stickers are wholly inappropriate, no one is sure what their point is.

'Some jokes are not funny': Business owners can't agree on what the stickers mean--is it racist or a message about gentrification?--but all say they're inappropriate

'Appalling and offensive display of ignorance': The stickers said they were sponsored by Austin's 'Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program' along with an official-looking city seal, which led the mayor to condemn the confusing prank

Some say the creator is attempting to make a statement.

'People are saying that this may be an attempt at satire, or a statement about gentrification,” said O'Neal said.

Others say it could be an offensive joke.

'Some jokes are not funny,' Texas House of Representatives member Dawnna Duke wrote in a Facebook post along with a photo of a sticker affixed to clothing store Rare Trends.

'If this is a joke at all, it is tasteless...I will be damned if this will occur in my House District … in this historical black community or any community.'

Regardless of its intent, Sugar Mama's employees have labeled it a hate crime.

'Today we were the victim of what I consider to be a hate crime against our family and staff at our Eastside location,” reads a post on the bakery's Instagram feed. 'Our business was built on family and love and we will let that shine on.'
