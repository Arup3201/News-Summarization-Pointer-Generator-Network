A new email exchange between Scott Rudin, Amy Pascal and Angelina Jolie reveals another example how the producer blasted the actress to the Sony studio head.

In the latest leaked exchange, Rudin criticises Angelina Jolie's planned remake of the classic Elizabeth Taylor film Cleopatra. 

Rudin had earlier described Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat.'   

This time however, Jolie was involved in the  exchange, but was occasionally taken off the chain so Rudin could comment about her behind her back.

The newest leak from Sony's hacked emails come after the film studio canceled its release of 'The Interview' - which depicts the assassination and violent of death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - after hackers threatened a 9/11-style attack on theaters that showed the film.

Hollywood stars reacted with shock and anger at Sony's announcement. Rob Lowe summed up the prevailing sentiment when he tweeted: 'The hackers won. wow.' 

American officials say they believe North Korea is behind the Sony hack attack. The hermit state called the end of the film 'an act of war.'

On Wednesday, 'Interview' stars Seth Rogen and James Franco were both spotted with bodyguards - a clear indication that they were taking the threats about the movie seriously. 

The exchange about Jolie, which was obtained by Defamer, begins with Rudin and Pascal discussing the possibility of David Fincher directing the planned remake of Cleopatra.

At one stage, it seemed that Sony had secured the services of Martin Scorsese for the project, which was later abandoned. 

Jolie appeared so desperate to work with him that she even said to Rudin: 'Let me know if there is anything I should be doing. Like getting on a plane and begging Marty.'

However, the Oscar-winning director is fully booked until 2016 and could not take on the project.

Later exchanges discuss what impact Angelina Jolie shaving her hair would have on the movie.

Cleopatra, like most wealthy Egyptians, shaved her head so as not to get lice and wore a wig.

Rudin, Pascal and Jolie considered whether the actress should be bald for the film's big sex scenes. 

Jolie wrote: 'The one thought I would ask you both is about her "bald". I think that made sense in earlier drafts but if we are saying every time she's in bed she has no hair or a shaved head it changes the sensuality.

'I wonder if we should keep it out and discuss as an idea with the director. But I worry we could scare off a director.'

Rudin replied: 'First I thought bald but then I was sitting at home during the night and I couldn't sleep because of it so now I think shaved; Or possibly a fade like Kid 'n Play. 

'Maybe shaved for Alexandria, bald for Rome? And then curly tendrils for the asp? What do you think?' 

Pascal liked the perm idea, noting how good Angelina looked with one in The Mighty Heart, which she described as 'that Jewish movie about Daniel pearl.'

All good: The two looked tense when photographed just days after the first email exchange between Pascal and Rudin leaked, in which he called her a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' 

Rudin then takes Jolie out of the email chain and tells Pascal: 'Kill me now. Immediately.'

According to the leaked emails, when the remake plan is abandoned, the studio executives consider filming a Shakespeare version of the story based on Antony and Cleopatra, still with the Tomb Raider actress playing the leading role.

Rudin said: 'We ought to make this with her and [Michael] Fassbender or [Tom] Hardy or [Benedict] Cumberbatch and go home.'

Jolie however responds that she thinks the script, by Eric Roth, is almost where it needs to be, and she would like to stay the course.

Rudin then removes Jolie from the email chain again, sending a message to Pascal: 'She's seriously out of her mind.' 

Pascal said she was willing to arrange a meeting between the three of them to sort out any potential problems. However, Rudin replied: 'Nooooooo noooooo noooooo please! Not a meeting!'

Earlier, Rudin had described Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in a previously leaked email. 

Rudin eventually apologized for the comments he made in that email, as well as an allegedly racist exchange he had with Pascal about President Obama.

He said: 'Private emails between friends and colleagues written in haste and without much thought or sensitivity, even when the content of them is meant to be in jest, can result in offense where none was intended.

'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive — and not funny at all. To anybody I’ve offended, I’m profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.'

These latest leaks come as the group claiming responsibility for the hack, the Guardians of Peace, have successfully forced Sony to abandon plans to release their move 'The Interview', which featured the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. 

The emails also reveal and exchange between Sony execs in which a producer reportedly tells CEO Michael Lynton not to case Denzel Washington in major films because the star doesn't sell tickets well in overseas markets - because worldwide goers are racist.  

Sony Pictures Entertainment pulled the planned Christmas Day release of the 'The Interview' after the hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the comedy.

A spokesman for the company admitted the $42 million movie is unlikely to be rescheduled: 'Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film.'

Sony's decision caused some consternation in Hollywood over what has been viewed as an act of voluntary censorship.

Writer Aaron Sorkin said: 'Today the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie.

'The wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the American press who chose gossip and schadenfreude-fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public–a story that was developing right in front of their eyes. My deepest sympathies go out to Sony Pictures, Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and everyone who worked on The Interview.' 

Rob Lowe tweeted: 'Wow. Everyone caved. The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow.' 

He later added; 'Saw @SethRogen at JFK. Both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this. Hollywood has done Neville Chamberlain proud today.' 

Zach Braff also weighed in, writing; 'Canceling "The Interview" seems like a pretty horrible precedent to set.' 

Steve Carrell kept it brief, saying on Twitter, 'Sad day for creative expression.'  

Carrell's planned movie on North Korea Pyongyang was also scrapped in response to the ongoing problems with the hermit state. 

Federal government officials have said that North Korea is behind the attack, as has been assumed for the past two weeks, though they are not expected to formally announce this until later this week.

Authorities are also looking into whether or not someone inside Sony helped the hackers.

Short and sweet: 'Sad day for creative expression,' said Steve Carrell (above)

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, director Judd Apatow voiced his concern over the situation: 'What do they do when someone says the same thing about the James Bond movie or Annie?

'There may be credible evidence of imminent violence that I don’t know about. But if they don’t really have that information, how many movies are they willing not to release?

'Our community is based on freedom of expression. Are we going to suppress ourselves every time someone posts something online? It’s a dark future.' 

Former Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich blasted Sony executives: 'No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very very dangerous precedent.

'Sony should release "the Interview" online for free so North Koreans can't censor American creativity--should have Korean language version.'
