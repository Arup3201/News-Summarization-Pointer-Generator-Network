A Jobcentre worker has scooped £5.9million in the world's biggest ever online bingo win - after betting just 30p on a video slot game based on Batman film The Dark Knight.

John Orchard, 60, of Long Sutton, Lincolnshire, had only been playing on the ButlersBingo website for a few days before his extraordinary win on a wheel of fortune-type of game on Sunday morning.

The grandfather-of-three has traded his Renault Clio for a £40,000 Jaguar XF, is set to visit Center Parcs this weekend with his wife Linda and family and expects Christmas to ‘be a blinder this year’.

Mr Orchard told the Sun: ‘I just couldn't believe I'd won it. This will change my life completely. I was looking at working for another five years at the Jobcentre - but not any longer.’

He has waited until today to resign from his job because he was waiting for his good fortune to sink in - and won the huge amount on a game that sees the jackpot rise as global players place their stakes.

Mr Orchard waited hours to tell his wife later that day - and when the gambling firm called to confirm the win, he told them to speak to his wife because she thought he was making it all up.

ButlersBingo head of promotions Ian O'Farrell said the website was ‘thrilled to be a record-breaker’ and ‘cannot wait to deposit £5,883,044.43 into John's bank account’.

The lucky couple have a great-granddaughter in Canada whom they now plan to fly to meet and are also planning to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary next year in style, reported the Sun.

They moved to Long Sutton, a market town near Spalding with an average property value of £147,000, after a factory run by Mr Orchard closed when production moved to China.

‘We wanted to cut our big mortgage - so we stuck a pin in the map and ended up here,’ he told the Sun of their move to the town 10 years ago.

The old world record for an online 
bingo jackpot was set in 2009 by 'Georgios M.', a 36-year-old married 
businessman from Greece, who won €6.3million (£5.1million) on the 
Riverbelle online casino.

The UK bingo win record was formerly held by Soraya Lowell, 38, who won £1.2million in Lanarkshire, Scotland, in 2008. Earlier this year a U.S. Marine won £1.7million on a Las Vegas fruit machine.

ButlersBingo is an online gambling website established in 2010, offering around 200 casino games.
