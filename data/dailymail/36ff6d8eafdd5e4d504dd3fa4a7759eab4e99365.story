Three women have come forward to say that a Catholic priest already facing child sexual abuse accusations molested them in the 1990s and he allegedly forced one to perform oral sex while in the confessional.  

Two of the three cases occurred when Reverand Mark Haynes was assigned to St. Ann's parish in Phoenixville and all women were minors at the time, say police.

One of those three women said that Haynes attacked her when she confessed that she performed oral sex on a teenage boy. He then made her repeat the sex act on him.

Philly.com reports that Haynes, formerly assigned to SS. Simon and Jude Parish in Westtown, hasn't yet been charged with sexual abuse and has denied all allegations.

Spokesman Ken Gavin of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is asking anyone with more information about Hayes to come forward.

Recent search terms on Haynes' computer are 'nude teen girls' and '8th grade girls tumblr.'

Haynes was charged with multiple counts of sexual abuse of children for possessing and disseminating child pornography last year and last month was arrested by FBI agents after federal prosecutors took over the child-pornography case.

MyFoxPhilly.com reports that while posing as his 16-year-old alias he was sending lewd emails to a 14-year-old girl.

Police say that Haynes posed as a fictional teenage girl named Katie Caponetti online and that he reached out to 25 teenage girls asking them to send nude photos of themselves.

Decades ago: Reverand Mark Haynes allegedly abused three teenage girls while working at St. Ann's parish in Phoenixville in the 1990s 

He also swapped hundreds of pornographic images of children online with other online users.

Federal prosecutors say that Haynes' arrest last year didn't stop him from soliciting minors.

While out on bail and local charges last year, he still used his Katie Caponetti name online while using a personal laptop he kept in the rectory at SS. Simon and Jude's.

Despite the new allegations against Haynes he was released on Tuesday and was ordered to pay $5,000 bail at the end of the week.

U.S. District Judge Lawrence F. Stengel has scheduled a new detention hearing for Wednesday after prosecutors appealed the decision to let him go.

Haynes has served at eight parishes in the Pennsylvania suburbs and also worked as a chaplain at Archbishop Wood High School in Warminster, and at the Office for Youth and Young adults.
