Singer Heather Naylor of The Electric Barabellas has accused Sydney Holland of wrestling control of Sumner Redstone's life and forcing him to pull support for her MTV series, which was canceled in 2013

Media mogul Sumner Redstone’s complicated professional and private life is being played out in court with his 43-year-old live-in girlfriend involved in a potentially damaging legal battle with the star of an ill-fated MTV reality series that the 91-year-old billionaire had befriended.

The nonagenarian’s girlfriend Sydney Holland has been waging her legal battle against Heather Naylor, a singer who starred in the short-lived MTV series The Electric Barbarellas, since August.

Holland is suing Naylor for $1 million, claiming the singer stole her computer containing ‘highly personal’ photos from the home she shares with Redstone, according to court documents obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.

Last week,
 Naylor launched her own counter-claim in which she accuses Holland of 
wrestling control of Redstone's life and forcing him to pull support for
 her MTV series, which was canceled in 2013.

Naylor
 claims the cancellation of Barbarellas, a reality show about her 
all-girl band, led to the implosion of her promising career.

Redstone is the executive chairman of Viacom which owns MTV. When Barbarellas debuted in 2011, there were accusations that Redstone had forced the network to broadcast the show after he had struck up a personal relationship with Naylor.

The allegations that Redstone was pushing MTV management to give more airtime to the Electric Barbarellas had emerged a year earlier.

In July 
2010, Redstone had been caught on tape demanding that a journalist 
reveal his source at MTV who was providing embarrassing details about 
Redstone and Naylor.

On the message, Redstone told the reporter that ‘we're not going to kill’ the source, adding ‘We just want to talk to him’.

He also told the reporter he would be ‘well rewarded and well protected’ if he gave up his source, although the reporter declined.

A Viacom spokesperson later confirmed that it was Redstone's voice on the message and said the mogul had made a mistake.

When the show eventually aired in 2011 it attracted poor ratings. A second season was commissioned, but later cancelled after ratings fell to less than a quarter of what the first season had attracted.

In her cross-complaint, Naylor accuses Holland of using her influence to have the show killed.

‘Holland grew jealous of Naylor's relationship with Redstone and made efforts to cut off all ties between Redstone and Naylor so that Holland could control Redstone for her own economic advantage,’ states her complaint.

In June 2013, Naylor alleges that Holland took steps to isolate Redstone, including attempting to limit access to him and firing loyal staff.

Naylor claims that her ‘relationship with MTV and Viacom came to a halt’ as a result of Holland and her relationship with Redstone also ‘disintegrated.’

Holland’s attorney Patty Glaser had denied that her client had anything to do with Barbarellas' demise.

Naylor's lawyer has been probing Holland’s relationship with Redstone for potentially scandalous material to use against her. Holland was asked in a recent filing if she had met Redstone on a ‘millionaire matchmaker’ dating site.

Redstone is the executive chairman of CBS Corporation and Viacom and according to Forbes he is worth US $6.2 billion

Glaser described that questions about Holland's sexual history and relationship with Redstone as 'inappropriate and harassing'. She asked the judge to prevent the line of questioning she described as 'titillating', but not relevant to who stole the laptop.

Glaser hopes the case can be resolved before a trial. 'The computer and whatever is on it should be returned to Sydney Holland,' she told The Hollywood Reporter.

Redstone is the executive chairman of CBS Corporation and Viacom, which own MTV Networks, BET, and the film studio Paramount Pictures. According to Forbes as of March 2014 he is worth $6.2 billion.
