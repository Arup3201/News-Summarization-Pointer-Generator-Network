Roy Hodgson fears for the future of the England team because of the number of foreign players in the Barclays Premier League.

Hodgson claims he is selecting his squad from a decreasing pool of talent because of the number of overseas stars in the top flight, and worries the national team will be dragged into a World Cup play-off after last month’s poor performance against Montenegro in Group H.

Hodgson, who succeeded Italian Fabio Capello as the country’s coach last May, said: ‘I go to quite a few games these days and there are no English players. One has to be very careful talking about the Premier League and the Englishness of it because two thirds of the players are not English. We have one of the lowest numbers of homegrown players and that must put us at a major disadvantage to other nations.’

Hodgson was at Old Trafford to watch 
six English players start for Manchester United and three for Manchester
City last week. But he is still at a disadvantage compared to the other
major leagues in Europe.

Just
34.9 per cent of the players in the Premier League are eligible  for 
the national team, compared with 45 per cent in Germany’s Bundesliga and
Italy’s Serie A, 58 per cent in France’s Ligue 1 and 59 per cent in 
Spain’s La Liga.

The demand 
for foreign talent even gripped Hodgson during his spell in charge at 
West Bromwich Albion before he replaced Capello at the end of last 
season.

Leading the way: Hodgson claims two-thirds of Premier League players - like Manchester City duo Samir Nasri and Sergio Aguero - are not English

In his final game as manager at  the Hawthorns, a 3-2 home defeat against Arsenal, he picked only two English players.

Billy
Jones and Liam Ridgwell are both eligible to play for the national 
team, but neither are considered good enough to break into the current 
squad. Despite Hodgson’s concerns, there are moves in place to safeguard
and protect the national team.

More
than £340million is being invested by the Premier League over the next 
five years in development projects across all levels of the game.

The
Elite Player Performance Plan has also been designed to produce more 
homegrown players because of the genuine fears about the quality of 
English talent.

Talking point: Hodgson's comments mirror the sentiments expressed recently by his assistant Gary Neville

The influence of foreign players has also affected the make-up of the PFA’s annual Team of the Year.

When
the award started in 1974, nine of the players voted for by fellow  
professionals in the old First Division were English. That trend 
continued until Argentina playmaker Osvaldo Ardiles became the first 
overseas player to be named in the Team of the Year in 1979.

The
Premier League era has had a massive influence on the nominations and 
now it is rare for more than four English players to be named.

Last year there were four, but in 2011 Joe Hart and Ashley Cole were the only English players in the team.

This
year there are concerns  that Leighton Baines, who has been outstanding
for Everton this season, may be the only Englishman named at next 
Sunday’s awards.

Wayne 
Rooney, who is still a key member of Hodgson’s squad, is the last 
English player to have won the PFA Player of the Year award in 2010.
