Charley Hull eats at Nando's, watches Ex 
on the Beach on MTV, messed up her first driving lesson, can barely say a
 sentence without the word 'like' in it and talks with teenage wonder 
about earning a million pounds.

In 
other words, she sounds like a typical 18-year-old, and that might be 
the most refreshing thing about this girl who has taken the European 
women's game by storm.

Smash hit: England's Charley Hull has taken the European women¿s game by storm

Impact: Hull shows off at Birkdale the swing that has propelled her to near the top of the women's game

For how often are we left cold by these teenage prodigies who sound like they've missed out their fun years of development altogether and are really about 30? 

Hull, by contrast, has a warmth about her and a no-nonsense approach to her sport that will serve her well when the difficult moments arrive. 

'When it comes to golf I've always thought, "Hit it, find it, hit it again",' she said. 'Who taught me that? Me. Why would you want to make it more complicated? It has served me well so far, and I can't see me changing.' 

Why would you? Just over a year on from her debut as a professional and she has had one win, five second places, one third on the LPGA Tour in the US, one top 10 in a major and was a star of Europe's Solheim Cup win last year. There's a lot to be said for 'hit it, find it, and hit it again'.

But there's a lot more to Hull's game than that, beginning with a 
ferocious work ethic that frequently sees her dropped off by her dad at 
Woburn first thing in the morning and picked up late at night. 
Presumably he will be glad when she can take herself, although it 
doesn't appear her skills in that particular driving department will be 
catching up to those on the driving range any time soon.

'It wasn't a
 good start to get told off on my first lesson!' she giggled. 'I was 
looking at the dials and thinking, "That's OK, I'm going about 30mph", 
but it turned out I was looking at the rev counter. In reality I was 
doing about 60!' 

As for the golf, she's moved effortlessly into the 
fast lane. The current leader of the European Ladies Order of Merit, 
she's ranked in the world's top 35 already and revelled in a duel with 
Michelle Wie and Jessica Korda in a recent LPGA tournament. She didn't 
win, but was appreciative of Korda's comments afterwards.

'She said 
to me she hoped I got my card to play in America because I fully 
deserved it,' said Hull. 'It was lovely to hear. I thought I showed I 
could play among the best at the Kraft Nabisco in April (the first 
women's major of each season) but Jess's comments told me I had been 
accepted, and were a huge boost to my confidence.

'I'm just living my
 dream right now. I never wanted to go to college in America because to 
me that was taking me away from my perfect job for four years.' 

That's
 the approach she will adopt as the leading home hope when the Ricoh 
Women's British Open gets under way at Royal Birkdale. 

Sometimes
 when she's in the rough, Hull will wonder what her hero, Seve 
Ballesteros, would do. The Spaniard announced himself to the world at 
Birkdale in 1976 with his unforgettable runner-up finish and, on the 
same stage, we await to see whether another precocious talent can leave a
 similar, indelible mark.
