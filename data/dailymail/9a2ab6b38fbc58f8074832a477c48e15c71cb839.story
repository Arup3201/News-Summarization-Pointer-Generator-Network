It's a macabre scene depicting St Lawrence being slowly burnt to death over a blazing fire.

It has emerged Renaissance artist Titian may have painted himself into the grim scene.

Experts restoring his 15ft-high The Martyrdom of St Lawrence have uncovered a man in a turban in the bottom corner.

Artist's face? The Martyrdom of St Lawrence, which has undergone a year-long restoration, apparently shows artist Titian's face in the bottom-left corner

The man’s face, tilted upwards and looking towards the burning man, bears a looks remarkably likeness to the artist himself.

Titian completed the work in the late 1550s – but the apparent self-portrait has gone undetected for more than 450 years, the Daily Telegraph reported.

St Lawrence, one of the seven deacons of Ancient Rome, was martyred in 258 for his beliefs.

Professor Lionello Puppi, a Titian expert, said the man’s face in the corner looked incredibly like that of the artist.

‘The similarity with the profile, and particularly the long, slightly hooked nose, is very striking,’ he told the Daily Telegraph.

‘We believe it may very well be a self-portrait by Titian. It is still to be verified and we are studying the archives to see if there are any other clues which might back it up.

‘The key question of course is why he would have included himself in the painting.’

Titian was born in around 1488 and named Tiziano Vecellio.

The painting was completed over more than a decade between around 1546 and 1558s.

Titian would have been aged in his late 50s or 60s at the time – about the same age as the man who appears in the bottom left hand corner of the portrait.

The work, estimated to be worth £40million, has undergone a year-long restoration programme.

The work is on display in Alba, north-east Italy, until August when it will return to Venice and the Church of the Jesuits.

Carvaggio, another Renaissance artist, also included himself into one of his works as the head of Goliath in his painting David with the Head of Goliath which dates from 1610.
