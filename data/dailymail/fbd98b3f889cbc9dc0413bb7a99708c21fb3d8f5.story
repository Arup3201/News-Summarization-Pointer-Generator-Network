Over the years it has boasted a membership of presidents, world leaders and celebrities such as Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks and offers fine dining in decadent surroundings at the heart of Disneyland - at a hefty price.

As such it has operated as one of the worlds most-secretive members-only clubs allowing famous Mickey fans to enjoy the park in comfort and privacy.

However, new photographs have, for the first time, revealed the luxurious surrounds behind the scenes at Disneyland's highly secretive Club 33.

Don't tell anyone: Some rare photographs have revealed the secret world behind Disney's top secret Club 33

Exclusive: Reportedly there are fewer than 500 members of the club. Stars rumored to have dined there include Elton John and Christina Aguilera

Photographer Pete Hottelet was able to visit the club and take a sneak-peak displaying the pictures on his website.

The members-only restaurant and club is reportedly open to less than 500
VIP patrons and costs a whopping $25,000 to join with an additional fee
of $10,000 a year - if you are lucky enough to make it on the waiting 
list.

It is highly private and nearly impossible to find in the California theme park's New Orleans Square - marked simply with a understated brass plaque saying '33'.

And the images reveal what is on offer for the price tag.

Decadent dining rooms with chandeliers and silver cutlery - a world away from the fast food stands below.

The setting looks like an old-fashioned New Orleans mansion with antique furniture, ornate decorations and an old-fashioned glass elevator with a leather banquet to admire the view.

Fine wine: Club 33 is the only place in Disneyland where you can buy alcohol and has an extensive wine list

Decadent: The club offers fine dining at the center of Disneyland and costs $25,000 to join plus $10,000 annual fees if you are permitted to join the waiting list

Antiques: Many of the club's furnishings were bought by Walt Disney and his wife from New Orleans' French Quarter in the Sixties

The food though haute cuisine has a nod to the theme park and its famous characters.

It is also the only place in the park where alcohol is served with a barman on duty and a large wine list available.

The club opened in 1967 when Walt Disney was inspired by the VIP 
lounges on offer to corporate sponsors at the New York World’s Fair.

Its website states Disney 'felt that a special place was needed where he could 
entertain visiting dignitaries and others in a quiet, serene atmosphere 
where superb cuisine and distinctive decor would complement one another'.

It was designed by artist Dorothea Redmond and finished by decorator 
Emil Kuri.

Disney and his wife purchased many of the antiques themselves in New Orleans.

Original sketches: As well as being furnished with antiques purchased by Walt Disney, the lounges in the club have many original sketches by Disney artists

Relaxing in splendor: Members can dine as well as relax in the club away from the bustle of the theme park. Walt Disney designed it himself as a place to entertain his VIP guests

Branding: The club is named after its address of 33 Royal Street but can only be located inside the theme park by a small bronze plaque

However, the man himself failed to see the club come to fruition as he died five months before its opening.

It is named after its address 33 Royal Street and has two dining areas and several lounges.

It also boasts an art gallery with many of the original sketches by Disney artists

Though the names of attendees are not officially revealed those who are rumored to have joined include 
some of the biggest stars and dignitaries of the last 40 years.

Last year the membership list, which was closed a decade ago, was opened up to mark the Club's 45th anniversary.

Some were concerned a little of the Club 33 magic would be lost

'For
me, it seemed very neat and special to have this one little club that 
nobody knew about,' David Koenig an author on Disney told the LA Times.

'We're 
losing that a little bit.'
