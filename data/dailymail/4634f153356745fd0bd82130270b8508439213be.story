Celebrity chef Bill Granger has sold his spacious Californian-style bungalow in Sydney's beachside suburb of Bronte for about $3.5 million, just over a month after he opened a brand new restaurant at nearby Bondi Beach.

Granger and wife Natalie Elliott, currently base in London, bought the four bedroom, two storey home on Yanko Avenue in 2008 for $2.88 million. Property agent Pauline Goodyer had quoted more than $3.3 million for the home ahead of Saturday's auction. 

The 590 square metre block is within walking distance of the sand and surf at Bronte beach and the popular new Bills Bondi restaurant. 

The house boasts 'idyllic' north-east facing gardens, period features and ocean views from the upper level.

Of course, it also features a designer open plan kitchen and dining room, a reflection of the 'sunny, easy-going, generous' approach to food and dining that has made Granger and his restaurants so popular around the world.

When Bills Bondi opened in September, the 45-year-old said: ‘It’s hard to believe that we’re only just opening in Bondi in 2014.' 

‘Bondi beach and Bills go together like surfers and boardshorts, limes and mojitos, and … hotcakes and honeycomb butter? We can’t wait to welcome you into our newest urban beach house, at the very sunny heart of the fabulous city where it all began.’

The self-taught cook dropped out of art school at the age of 24 to open his first ‘Bills’ restaurant in Sydney’s Darlinghurst in 1992. He now owns a string of restaurants around the world - including in Japan, Hawaii and London - and is a celebrated food writer and television chef.  

The couple and their three daughters Edie, Ines and Bunny are reportedly planning to return to Sydney and are looking for a larger family home in the eastern suburbs. 

Bronte, not as built up as its neighbour, Bondi, is now one of Sydney's hottest beach-side real estate markets, with current medium house prices up more than 20 per cent on last year to $2,305,000.
