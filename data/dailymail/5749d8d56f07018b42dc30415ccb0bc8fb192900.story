Despite the old adage that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, a recent study suggests that may not actually be the case.

New research from Monash University in Melbourne has discovered that holding off on your first meal of the day could help tackle Australia's growing obesity epidemic.

Of the thirty-two people involved in the study, all lost weight within the first 12 weeks by fasting from 8pm in the evening until midday the next day,The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

A new study from Monash University in Melbourne has revealed skipping the first meal of the day may be the key to weight loss

The patients all suffered from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and each participant managed to reduce the circumference of their waist during the initial period - a sign of repairing liver damage. 

Dr Alex Hodge, who worked on the study, told the publication that similar studies had been carried out on animals in the past, and said the results showed restricting access to food helped prevent animals develop a range of health problems.

The Melbourne gastroenteroligist also said the findings could present a new solution to the growing obesity epidemic in Australia.

Patients involved in the study saw improved liver function, lowered blood pressure and a range of other health benefits

'Despite the small numbers of participants in this novel study, there was a significant health benefit from intermittent fasting. 

'When the standard care group was changed to intermittent fasting for an additional 12 weeks, they continued to show improvements,' Dr Hodge revealed.

The study found that all patients who fasted showed improvements in a number of areas of their health, including blood pressure, insulin resistance and other indicators of liver damage.

Fatty liver damage affects more than 5.5 million Australians, while one in three adults are now classified as obese.
