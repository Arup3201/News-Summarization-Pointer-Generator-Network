Burnley are keen on a deal for West Bromwich Albion midfielder Graham Dorrans.

Manager Sean Dyche had initially considered a move for Cardiff City's Icelandic international Aron Gunnarsson

But Albion are willing to listen to bids for Dorrans and his added Premier League experience is appealing for Burnley.

Dorrans, 27, has been at West Brom since 2008 but manager Tony Pulis wants four new players ideally and is willing to sacrifice the Scotland international to strengthen other areas.

Pulis has been rebuffed in attempts to sign Rickie Lambert from Liverpool and has cooled his interest for Blackburn's Rudy Gestede while Demba Ba's wages make any move difficult.
