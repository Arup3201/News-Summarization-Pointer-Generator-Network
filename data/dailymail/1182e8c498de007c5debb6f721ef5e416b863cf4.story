Almost a third of us have smashed a phone screen, dropped it in the toilet or damaged the case, and getting it fixed can be a long, tedious and expensive affair - until now. 

The iCracked site offers on-demand repairs for Apple and Samsung devices using a network of more than 1,000 certified tech experts and engineers.

Users can order a so-called iTech to come to their home, office or even a nearby coffee shop - and repairs are carried out on the spot.

The iCracked site offers on-demand repairs for Apple and Samsung devices. Repairs take up to an hour and are each covered by a lifetime warranty. Prices vary, depending on the phone and the damage, but as a guide, a cracked screen on an iPhone 5 costs £80, which includes the engineer's time, the display and the warranty

Alternatively, people can choose to post their phone to an iTech, and delivery is all arranged and guaranteed through the site.

iCracked launched in 2010 and is available in London from today.

There are 30 tech experts available in London at launch, and iCracked will expand this network and roll out to more UK locations next year.

Each iTech is a qualified tech expert and iCracked certifies and runs background checks on every engineer it adds to its network. 

Research from iCracked found that Londoners are the most accident prone in the UK, with 44 per cent admitting to breaking a phone. 

In particular, 57 per cent of young professionals, between 18 and 44, in London have damaged a handset.

The value of a fully functioning smartphone is most evident in the 18 to 24 age group however, who consider damaging their mobile phone as much of a disruption to their daily lives as being struck down with the flu. 

Engineers are also rated by users, and sorted by location.

All repairs take between 20 minutes and an hour, and are covered by a lifetime warranty.

The network of engineers is able to repair the iPhone 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, 3GS, 3G, the iPad Air, Mini, and models one through four.

iTechs also fix the second-generation to fifth-generation iPods, and the Samsung Galaxy range including the Note, Note 2, Note 3, S3, S4, S5

Prices vary, depending on which phone is damaged, and what needs repairing, and the working hours of engineers varies, too.

Repairs cover water damage, a cracked screen, jammed home or power buttons, broken charging port, headphone port, or microphone, damage to the cameras and battery problems.

And as a guide, a cracked screen on an iPhone 5 costs £80 ($126), which includes the engineer's time, the replacement display and the warranty.

A.J. Forsythe, iCracked co-founder, said: ‘For most people, their phones are an extension of themselves, so when it breaks it can have a huge impact on their everyday lives.

‘I’m determined to bring the iCracked service to as many people as possible in the UK.

‘With trained iTechs on the streets of London capable of repairing iPhones in minutes, no longer will damaging a smartphone spell the end of a night out, or separate people with their loved ones, and their emails, for days on end.’

iCracked also provides a buy-back service for old devices.

This is expected to launch in the UK in 2015, following the successful roll-out of the on-demand and mail-order repair services.
