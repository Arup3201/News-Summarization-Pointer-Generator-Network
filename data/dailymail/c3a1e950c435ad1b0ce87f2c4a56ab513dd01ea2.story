Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said teachers can empower girls and help them to reject stereotypes

Big business is promoting a ‘raunch culture’ that corrupts young girls, teachers warned yesterday.

Playboy bunnies ‘adorn’ children’s pencil cases, pole dancing is portrayed as empowering and beauty pageants have become a staple of student life, they said.

As a result, girls are becoming fixated with their figures, with many developing eating disorders and some diabetics even shunning insulin to stay slim.

The bleak assessment that sexism has reversed women’s liberation was laid out at the National Union of Teachers’ conference in Liverpool.

Sara Tomlinson, from Lambeth in south London, said: ‘Big business has taken the liberation we fought for and is selling it back to us at a huge cost.

‘We are seeing a rise in cosmetic surgery, a fixation with body sizes, the selling of Playboy merchandise and pole dancing kits to younger and younger children.’

Bristol delegate Sharon Anderson said: ‘We are now seeing the repackaging of sexual liberation, with it being re-sold to women in the form of raunch culture.’

'This has triggered widespread anxiety and low self-esteem among girls, she added.

The Daily Mail has reported that shops have been caught selling dubious products to children including padded bras and underwear with suggestive messages.

An NUT motion stated: ‘The objectification of women’s bodies is playing an ever more horrifying role in society and is having a disastrous effect upon the self-image of girls and young women.

'Growing up in a world where it is normal for women’s bodies to be seen as sex objects affects the way that girls in our schools grow to view themselves and their place in society.

‘Girls are coming under unprecedented pressure to conform with unrealistic physical and sexual ideals and modifying their behaviour because of contact with adult material.’

Women's liberation has been turned back 40 years by a new 'raunch culture' that has led to pole-dancing exercise classes, teachers are expected to claim today

The Association of Teachers and 
Lecturers conference last week heard that girls of 13 are taking part in
homemade porn movies and 12-year-olds are waxing or shaving intimate 
areas.

Many agree to boyfriends’ demands to 
send revealing photos of themselves, only for the images to be shared 
around or posted online.

A survey by the union found 
four-fifths of teachers reported concerns about young girls feeling 
under pressure to maintain a certain body image and suffering low 
self-esteem.

Another report earlier this month 
revealed most parents think their children’s innocence ends at 12 now 
because of the ‘toxic combination’ of online porn and celebrity culture.

The NUT discussed the need for sex and relationship education to be compulsory during an earlier debate.

General Secretary Christine Blower 
said: ‘It is important for all children and young people to learn, in an
age-appropriate manner, about respect for their own and other people’s 
bodies and emotions.

‘This is all the more important given the rising levels of pornography which is very much in the public domain.’
