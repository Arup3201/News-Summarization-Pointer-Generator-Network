More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest passenger jetliner but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly.

The damage has been found in two more A380 superjumbos, just two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft, which entered service just over four years ago.

The initial discovery led to Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association last week called for the aircraft to be grounded amidst safety concerns.

Safety concerns: More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest jetliner, the 525-seat, double-decker A380 superjumbo, but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly

'Airbus confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some A380s,' the planemaker said in a statement.

'Airbus emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft.'

The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) confirmed it would issue a bulletin Friday mandating precautionary checks.

The latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two-year inspection, an Airbus spokeswoman said. 

EADS subsidiary Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007, followed by Dubai's Emirates and Qantas Airways of Australia.

Other operators include Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air and China Southern.

So big that many airports had to modify their facilities to accomodate it, the A380 was designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the large passenger aircraft market.

The aircraft's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, allowing for a cabin space of 5,145 sq ft - some 49 per cent more than Boeing's 747, the next largest passenger jet currently in service.

The A380 is designed for a range of up to 9,600 miles (15,400km), enough to fly from New York to Hong Kong, at a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (560mph or 900km/h).

However, since the first deliveries of the aircraft in 2007, the planes have already been plagued with a series of problems.

A blowout in the superjumbos' Derby-built Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines led to an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 in November 2010.

Qantas grounded its Airbus fleet for more than a fortnight after the midair explosion over Singapore, which was found to have been caused by a faulty pipe.

Rolls subsequently admitted dealing with the fault, including replacing the engines on several aircraft, had cost it £56million.

Even the A380's massive size has posed difficulties. Last June an Airbus 380 lost its wing-tip in a taxiing collision with a building at Le Bourget airport Paris.

The collision mirrored an incident at JFK airport earlier that year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an A380.

The latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks, an L-shaped bracket which connects the wing's exterior to the internal 'rib' structure.

A380 wings are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol, before they are shipped to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for final assembly.

Each aircraft is powered by four Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines, built in Derby. In total, some 20,000 British workers' jobs rely on the construction of the mammoth planes.

Industry journal Air Transport Intelligence said the brackets, known as rib feet, had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed.

The A380 has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m (261ft 10in).
