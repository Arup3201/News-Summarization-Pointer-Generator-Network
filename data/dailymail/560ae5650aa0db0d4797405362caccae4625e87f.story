From the £5,000 hot tub in the garden to the draft beer on tap in the sleek modern kitchen, this house could have been designed for a wealthy businessman or footballer.

In fact, the luxurious Lancashire property belongs to drug dealer Paul Emsley, 45, who has been jailed for 14 years after being convicted of supplying heroin and money laundering.

Police raiding the house in Burscough discovered the father-of-two had spent thousands on turning the three-bedroom semi-detached into a lavish home with wet room, wine cooler and CCTV system.

Emsley spent an estimated £20,000 transforming his kitchen, installing a Belfast sink, a range cooker, spotlights and a beer pump serving Peroni on draft.

'Leading role': Drug dealer Paul Emsley, who is starting a 14 year jail sentence, lived in luxury at his Lancashire home

He also added a £150,000, two-storey extension that housed two extra bedrooms, converted the loft and installed a hot tub in the back garden at the property, where police found £46,000 in cash stuffed in a safe.

Emsley - who was observed by police dealing heroin on a near daily basis on the outskirts of his Lancashire village - also paid for a built-in TV screen in his wet room with the proceeds of his 'large-scale operation' supplying street dealers.

Officers filmed the full extent of his designer makeover as they searched the £300,000 property for evidence Emsley was involved in dealing heroin in Fleetwood.

They found thousands of pounds in cash in a safe at the property, and discovered £118,000 had been credited to his bank account.

Today, as Emsley began his 14 year jail sentence, Lancashire Police said he had played a 'leading role' in a major drug dealing operation.

He supplied street dealers - 
including a husband and wife - on a day to day basis by meeting them on 
the outskirts of the village of Burscough, where he lived with his 
partner and their children.

In
total police observed him selling heroin to one dealer on 139 days in a
period of 169 days in a country lane outside the village.

After
the case at Preston Crown Court Detective Constable Ian Marsh said: 
'When we searched Emsley’s house we discovered it had been extensively 
renovated.

'There was a large amount of cash 
found in a safe downstairs. And it was clear to see that despite being 
unemployed he lived in a very lavish house. The whole property had been 
very well furnished.

'There
was an expensive kitchen, including draft beer on tap, a hot tub in the
garden, a television screen integrated into the shower unit and £46,000
cash inside the safe, all this was funded by the proceeds of drug 
dealing.' 

Pricey: The high-end fixtures and fittings included a Belfast sink in the kitchen

Unemployed: Jobless father-of-two Paul Emsley, 45, lived in a 'very lavish house', police said

Renovations: The drug dealer spent £150,000 on an extension to his house, adding a further two bedrooms

He added: 'This was a large-scale organised set up and the offenders have made a lot of money through their crimes. Bringing heroin into towns and cities puts people’s lives at risk and causes misery among communities.

'Paul Emsley was observed driving to a quiet road on the outskirts of the village to meet up with others.

'In total we observed one dealer travel to Burscough for the meetings on 139 out of 169 consecutive days which shows that this was almost a daily meeting.

Expensive: Emsley is thought to have spent around £20,000 on transforming the kitchen at his home

Extravagant: The shower at Emsley's house was fitted with a built-in television screen

Little luxuries: The remote control panel for the flat screen TV fitted in Emsley's wet room

Keeping tabs: Emsley, who was convicted of supplying heroin and money laundering, had a CCTV system installed at his home

'We are satisfied with the sentence given today and hope it goes some way in warning other people involved in drug dealing that it will not be tolerated and we will catch you,' he added.

Three others were sentenced in connection with the 'large-scale' drug dealing operation in the Lancashire seaside town.

David Kyle, 45, and his wife 
Kimberley, 29, both of Fleetwood both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to 
supply heroin.

He was jailed for eight years, while his wife was handed a 
five year sentence.

Close watch: Emsley was able to keep tabs on what was going on around his property from the master bedroom

Ill-gotten gains: A sleek modern fireplace at the drug dealer's £300,000 home in the village of Burscough

Home comforts: His and hers sinks in the bathroom at the house where Emsley lived with his partner and their children

David Jones, 51, of Fleetwood,was found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin and was jailed for four years.

The
court heard David Kyle would make frequent trips in a car driven by 
Jones to the Burscough area, where he would be supplied drugs by Emsley.

Kimberley
Kyle was in frequent contact with her husband when he was away on such 
trips and she would await delivery. Sometimes, she even had customers 
waiting.

David Kyle: Jailed for eight years

Kim Kyle: Jailed for five years

David Jones: Jailed for four years

Police swooped to arrest David Kyle and Jones on the way home from a meeting.

Kyle had two half ounce bags of heroin, worth £2,750, on his person.

The judge Recorder Andrew Long said: 'There is no doubt these offences inflicted untold misery on many people in Fleetwood and beyond, both as addicts and as the victims of acquisitive crime.

'Punishment was required, both to punish you and to deter others.'
