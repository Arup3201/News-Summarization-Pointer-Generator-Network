Liverpool owner John Henry claims the time was right to sell Luis Suarez, and he has no doubt Liverpool's attack will be able to cope without him this season.

The Uruguayan striker swapped Merseyside for Barcelona in a £75m move after an impressive season in England that saw him scoop the PFA and FWA Player of the Season awards.

However, after biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, Suarez received a four-month ban from FIFA and Henry decided it was time to cash in.

The 64-year-old said: 'It was time for Luis and time for the club to make a break. He brought so much to the club but we brought a lot to Luis.'

The Chiellini affair was the third biting incident in a career as marred by controversy as it has been blessed by talent. Despite his reputation, though, Luis Suarez never actually received a red card during his time in England.

Liverpool have already begun investing the proceeds from the sale of the 27-year-old. Rickie Lambert has re-joined the club he left as a teenager while Loic Remy has signed from QPR.

And Henry believes Brendan Rodgers' side will have more than enough potency to succeed next season. He said: 'I think you will still see a very explosive Liverpool offense.'

Liverpool will face Olympiacos, Manchester City, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund in their remaining pre-season games. Their first match of the Premier League season is at home to Southampton - a fixture they lost 1-0 last September.
