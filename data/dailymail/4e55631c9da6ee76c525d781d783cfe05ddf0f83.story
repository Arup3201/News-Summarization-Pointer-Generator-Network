In what has to be one of the most emotional press conferences ever given by a sportsman, Australian captain Michael Clarke, paid tribute to Philip Hughes on behalf of his team and Cricket Australia on Saturday morning at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).

From the moment Clarke sat down and said to the gathered press, 'I'll do my best, guys', it was clear just how much he was hurting and how hugely emotional it was going to be for him to read the statement at all. 

Struggling to keep his composure, Clarke took deep breaths and wept, as he paid a massive tribute to his close friend and team mate Hughes.

'Words cannot express the loss we all feel as a team right now,' Clarke began. 

'To Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan (Hughes' family), we share in the deep pain that you're feeling.' 

Clarke began to breakdown in tears at this point, but was able to compose himself. 

'Apart from when he was at home on the farm with his beloved cattle, Hughesy was at his happiest playing cricket for his country with his mates,' he continued.

'Things were always put into perspective when Hughesy said: 'Where would you rather be boys than playing cricket for your country'.'

Still struggling to keep his emotions in check, Clarke sighed audibly before continuing. 

'We're going to miss that cheeky grin and twinkle in his eye,' he said. 'He epitomised what the baggy green is about and what it means to us all.

'The world lost one of its great blokes this week and we are all poorer for it.' 

The Australian captain sobbed throughout as he gave his statement

'Our dressing room will never be the same. We love him and always will. Rest in peace bruzzy,' said Clarke

Clarke's emotional reaction may now call into further doubt Australia's first Test against Indian in Brisbane on Thursday as the final decision on whether it will go ahead is being left up to the players

Clarke regularly took deep breaths to help get him through the press conference 

Clarke promised Hughes' family that they would do 'everything we can to honour his memory'. He then confirmed that Hughes' international one-day shirt number, 64, would be retired by Cricket Australia. 

'That means so much,' he said.

Clarke added that Hughes' 'legacy of trying to improve each and every day will drive us for the rest of our lives'. 

After thanking everyone 'here and overseas for the touching tributes to Hughesy', Clarke paused for what seemed an age to compose himself again, before ending the statement by saying in a breaking voice: 

'Our dressing room will never be the same. We love him and always will. Rest in peace bruzzy.' 

The 25-year-old Hughes died on Thursday after being struck by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield game on Tuesday.

Cricket Australia announced on Saturday evening that Australia's match against India will not go ahead, with the final decision left up to the players.

But the fact that Hughes’ family want the match to go ahead – as it is what he would have wanted – could make the crucial difference.

Throughout the whole tragic saga of Hughes’ freak accident and death, it has been the wishes of the family that both Australian cricketers and team management have strictly abided by.

9News reported that although the players’ feelings had to be respected after such a bereavement – the family’s wishes will have a huge bearing on the decision to play.

‘I've heard the Hughes family are keen for that (Test) to go ahead, obviously that's going to be a question for the players,’ South Australian Cricket Association chief Keith Bradshaw said. 

The Nine Network reported on Friday night the Hughes family suggested that the first session of the Test at the Gabba be abandoned and Hughes' bat and helmet be placed on the pitch as a tribute. According to the report, the match would then start after lunch.

For now the Gabba is taking direction from Cricket Australia (CA) regarding the first Test, and CA is naturally proceeding cautiously with emotions still so raw.

Speaking moments after captain Clarke and opening batsman David Warner arrived at the SCG for a team meeting on Friday, Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said cricket would go on 'when it's ready'.

'The starting point is [the players] are grieving and they’ve lost someone that’s incredibly close to them, and I think there’s enough that we understand about grieving processes to know that it’s really important to give people time,' Mr Sutherland said.

‘To be honest they’ve got other things on their mind and I know for many people seven days doesn’t seem very far away, next Thursday, but in other ways it’s a million miles away,’ he said.

‘We’ll get there when we can.’

However, although the merits of playing, delaying or abandoning the start of a four-Test series against India are still being considered, there are other realities.

The series is a huge money spinner for organisers and sponsors, particularly in India, where millions of fanatical cricket fans have been waiting for the series all year.

Indian cricket officials have already had to back down after initially saying that Friday’s tour match against the Cricket Australia XI had to go ahead.

‘Postponed because of one player? I don’t think so,’ a spokesman for the Board of Control for Cricket in India told The Daily Telegraph.

However, when it became apparent that Hughes was on his death bed they agreed for the match to be postponed.

Australian cricket chief Sutherland said they were in constant contact with the India team and management who had been ‘supportive and sincere’ throughout. 

Meanwhile all over Australia on Saturday cricket clubs and players of all ages were showing their respect for Hughes.
