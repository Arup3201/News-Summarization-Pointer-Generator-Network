High school senior Draven Rodriguez will get his wish to have a picture of himself with his cat in the yearbook. but only if he's willing to share the space with his principal.

Rodriguez's original plan was to use a picture posing with cat Mr. Bigglesworth framed by lasers as his senior photo at New York's Schenectady High School, but that school officials refused to put it in the portrait section.

Rodriguez, 16, started an online petition to support his picture, and now he's been offered a spot on the principal's page with administrator Diane Wilkinson and her mixed chihuahua, Vivienne.

His campaign soon went viral, prompting support from publications like Gawker, Time, and Cosmopolitan.

The picture, which will be taken by the same photographer and retain Rodriguez's lasers backdrop, will include an urge for animal rescue and adoption.

“I don’t want to go in the yearbook with the generic ‘I-look-like-everyone-else’ photo. I wanted a ‘He looks great. Only he would try that’ photo,'' Rodriguez told The Daily Gazette. 'When people look at it, they will know that was me.'

School officials said the image of Rodriguez and cat Mr. Bigglesworth did not meet yearbook guidelines for the portrait section

Though Rodriguez could not be reached for comment, district spokeswoman Karen Corona said he was on board.

'It was the principal's idea, she went to the student with it, and he loved it,' Corona told The Times-Union.

To be included in the senior portrait section an image must be uniform and 'professional looking.'

'I'm a little out there, and a little tongue-in-cheek,' Rodriguez said. 'Cats and laser....sarcastic. It's so outlandish and ridiculous

Rodriguez was the first to admit the original image was over the top, which was the point to begin with.

'I'm a little out there, and a little tongue-in-cheek,' he said. 'Cats and laser....sarcastic. It's so outlandish and ridiculous.

'I'm not trying to make any statement other than my photo is ridiculous and this is how I am.'
