You don’t earn the title ‘Spiderman’ without completing some astonishing, not to mention, death-defying climbs.

Now Frenchman Alain Robert, who gained the moniker for a list of daring ascents of the some of the world’s tallest skyscrapers without safety equipment, is claiming even to have outdone himself with his latest breath-taking stunt.

The 49-year-old has set a new Guinness World Record after climbing Qatar’s highest building – the tallest ascent without a rope.

Vertigo: French climber Alain Robert, known as Spiderman for his death defying ascents of the world's highest buildings without safety equipment, today scaled the tallest building in Qatar

Heart-stopping: There's no margin for error as Alain Robert takes on the last few of the 317 metres to the summit of Qatar's tallest skyscraper

There was absolutely no margin for error before he reached the top of the 317metre Torch Doha Hotel, in just 1hour, 33 minutes and 44 seconds, yesterday afternoon.

Thousands of spectators filled the street far below to watch the attempt. And when he finished he was awarded with a certificate by Andrea Banfi from the Guinness team for the feet.

Robert has now scaled more than 85 
structures – many with the aid of only a pair of rubber climbing shoes, 
some chalk, and nerves of steel.

The attempt was organised in 
conjunction with Aspire Zone Foundation and formed part of a 3D 
documentary filmed by Robert’s production team about the daredevil’s 
life.

‘I wasn’t scared but there were a lot 
of factors that made it extremely difficult for me to reach the top of 
the Torch, including the wind and the structure of the building,’ he 
told the Gulf Times, adding ‘I wasn’t able to turn around but I could 
hear the crowd below cheering for me.’

Robert has now climbed some of the 
most iconic buildings in world, including the Empire State Building, 
Chicago’s Willis Tower and the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, as well 
as Doha’s La Cigale Hotel which he climbed in 2008.

He also took just over six hours to conquer the tallest structure in the world, the Burj Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates.

‘The Human Spider’ began climbing as a
young boy scaling rock cliffs in the area around his home at Digoin, 
Saone-et-Loire, Bourgogne in France.

His love affair with risky ascents has not come without accidents.

During an interview in 2005, he said he has fallen seven times in his life - with some of the worst coming in 1982.

In January, he plummeted almost 50ft 
when his safety equipment failed during training. He fractured his 
wrists, heels and nose and underwent three operations.

He was left in a coma for five days 
following a fall while abseiling in September that same year. He 
fractured both forearms, his elbow, pelvis and nose. His elbow was also 
dislocated and a nerve was damaged, leaving him partially paralyzed. He 
also suffered cerebral edema and vertigo.

He underwent six operations on his 
hands and elbow. But none of this has prevented him from racking up an 
amazing list of subsequent climbing accomplishments and records.
