Dark matter is beginning to live up to its name.

The mysterious force could be what killed off the dinosaurs, according to a new study that attempts to explain presence.  

The research argues that comets are not created by the sun’s influence over space rocks, but instead pushed towards our planet by dark matter.

Dark matter is considered crucial to theories explaining how the universe is expanding and how galaxies interact.

Scientists are fairly sure it exists, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it.

Astronomers have only been able to theorise its existence through the gravitational effects it has on matter in the universe.

Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light.

It
 cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be 
out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we 
can see.

The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates.

'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist.

'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.'

Scientists are fairly sure it exists and 
is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or 
where to find it.

Lisa
 Randall and Matthew Reece at the university in Massachusetts claim that
 as the solar system orbits the centre of the Milky Way, it 
moves up and down in a 70 million year cycle.

Their calculations suggest the solar system would move through a dark matter disc every 35 million years, according to a report in the New Scientist.

A similar pattern was previously seen in research of comet impacts on Earth, which highlighted that they appear to increase every 35 million years.

The team looked to see if there was a connection between comet impacts and the solar system moving through the dark matter disc.

When the solar system moves through a disc, it faces a strong gravitational pull that disrupts areas such as the Oort cloud, which could trigger movement in space rocks towards Earth.

The team looked at large craters on Earth that were created in the last 250 million years.

Their analysis suggested that the dark matter idea would be more likely to produce the observed patterns in crater impacts than an average rate of impact.

However, the crater that has been linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago does not completely coincide with the solar system passing through the disc.

The paper said there's not enough data to make this more than ‘a fascinating possibility worthy of further exploration.’

As solar system orbits centre of galaxy, it moves around in 70m year cycle

@highlight

Means it would move through a dark matter disc every 35 million years

@highlight

This corresponds to increase in pattern of comet impacts on Earth

Researchers conclude this could have led to impact that has been linked to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago
