A company has launched revolutionary software for tracking stolen mobile phones that is impossible to remove from the device - even with a factory reset.

Absolute LoJack allows users to remotely lock their stolen device, locate it, and delete sensitive files to prevent identity theft.

The company’s Investigations and Recovery Services team can track phones using the Computrace system, pictured, and will work with law enforcement agencies globally to get a device back.

And unlike apps already on the market such as Find my iPhone and Hidden, Lojack will survive a factory reset and full erase.

It is built into the firmware on Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 tablet.

There are 300 mobile phone thefts in London alone every day, according to figures from the Metropolitan Police.

Mark Grace, from Absolute Software, said: 'Smartphone theft is a worldwide epidemic.

'With Absolute persistence technology, the owner can activate the "kill switch" and those responsible for theft can be identified or located and held accountable.'

The unique software was able to track down a thief who stole a brand new Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone.

The Absolute Software customer had the expensive Samsung stolen in Minneapolis.

It was then reported to the local police station and to the software company.

Through the use of Absolute’s forensic tools, the team managed to analyse a number of texts, emails and screenshots which enabled them to identify the user.

The team then located the home address of the suspect and aided by the police, they visited the house the following day.

Within ten minutes of the detective being at the suspect’s house, the thief handed the smartphone in and it was returned to its rightful owner.

Derek Skinner, also from Absolute Software, said: 'We believe LoJack for Mobile Devices will act as an important deterrent in the fight against the rise of mobile phone crime.'

LoJack for Mobile Devices costs from £29.95 for a one-year subscription.
