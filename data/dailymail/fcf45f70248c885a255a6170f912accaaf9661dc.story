When faced with a dead end, some motorists apparently just don't know when they are beaten.

Instead of turning around and looking for another way across a raging river with no bridge nearby, a group of adventurous Russians decided they would save time and fly across in their car.

They hoisted the vehicle onto zip-line wires above the waters of the Siberian river.

Scroll down for video

Ready for lift-off: The white estate car is gently lowered over the edge of a raging river on a zip-wire after a group of Russians found there was no bridge to cross

Look no road: The vehicle goes further out across the river held up only by wires

So far so good: The car is half way across the swollen river appearing to fly on the zip-line

It hung by just four cords attached to its wheels as it moved inch by inch along the wires with the river about 10 metres below racing past.

The white estate car hung in the air for a few minutes before sliding along to the other side of theÂ  waters.

Finally, it reached the shore, but there was no film of how it was brought down from the zip-line

The video of the feat is spreading across the internet with some doubters claiming it's just a clever tricked up stunt.

Still dry: The car approaches the other side of the shore, apparently intact and on course to fly over the river

Made it in one piece: The car arrives at the other side of the river moments after being launched from the other shore

Safe: The car rocks gently on the other side of the river after flying over the raging waters
