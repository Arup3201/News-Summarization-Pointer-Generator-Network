Miscarriage: Andrea Leadsom, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the period after the birth was 'quite traumatic'

A Tory minister has described how she suffered from post-natal depression and endured two miscarriages following the birth of her first son.

Andrea Leadsom, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said the period after the birth was ‘quite traumatic and unlike anything ever before’. 

And she called for more help for new mums to prevent post-natal depression.

Mrs Leadsom, 51, who was a senior executive at Barclays at the time, said she went back to work full-time after her son was born and the bank refused to let her go part-time. But she said the depression ‘didn’t last very long’ and going back to work actually ‘sorted me out’. 

She also revealed that after the birth of her third child she went straight to a selection meeting for a constituency where she was hoping to be selected as the Tory candidate.

She said: ‘The day you give birth, you feel like you can do anything. The day after, you feel like you’ve been run over by a bus.’

Mrs Leadsom entered Parliament in 2010 after a long career in banking and was appointed to the Treasury in April after the resignation of Maria Miller as Culture Secretary.

The MP for South Northamptonshire is a trustee of a local ‘Parent Infant Project’ which aims to help parents of children under two bond better with their children.  

Mrs Leadsom said violent crime and mental health problems in later life could be ‘laid at the door of a very bad early start’.

She told House Magazine that her mother, a trained midwife, had carried out research into post-traumatic stress women suffer because of ‘appalling childbirth experiences’.

‘So if you’re completely traumatised by a terrible birth, it can actually be PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) wrongly diagnosed as post-natal depression.

'She lectured around the world on that subject. When my first son was born I was at Barclays, I was a senior executive, they wouldn’t let me go part-time. I had two miscarriages, I had a bout of post-natal depression.

‘I don’t want to over-egg it because it didn’t last very long and actually going back to work sorted me out. But I certainly remember the period after my first child being quite traumatic and unlike anything ever before.’

Mrs Leadsom says she understood the problem and that more should be done to intervene in the ‘peri-natal’ period immediately after the birth to prevent severe depression or domestic violence as these can have ‘utterly life-changing consequences’ for the baby.

She added: ‘Many of the ills of our society, violent crime, homelessness, psychosis, self-harming can be laid at the door of a very bad early start. But so too can a lot of poor mental health, backache, depression, relationship breakdown.’ It is understood Mrs Leadsom does not make any link between her miscarriages and her going back to work full-time.

She told how she turned up to the selection meeting for the Reading East constituency in 2003 on the same day that she gave birth to her third child.

When she was interviewed to appear on David Cameron’s ‘A-list’ of candidates she was asked about that day.

‘They were thinking, “you must be off your rocker”,’ she said.

Mrs Leadsom also revealed that in her experience Parliament was much better than the City in terms of sexism and how women are treated.

She said: ‘All I can say is my ten years in the thick of the City, compared to my four years in Parliament, I would say Parliament is a million times less sexist, less misogynist, more egalitarian.’
