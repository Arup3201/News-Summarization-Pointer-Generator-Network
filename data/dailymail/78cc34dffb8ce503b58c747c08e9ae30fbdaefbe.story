A 17-year-old jockey has died after he was thrown from his horse when it clipped another rider during a race at an Indiana racecourse.

Juan Saez, from Panama, passed away on Tuesday after he suffered a head trauma at the Indiana Grand Racing & Casino, and his horse, Montezuma Express, was euthanized following the fall.

Another horse, Platitude, was also euthanized at the track on the same night but authorities said he was involved in a separate incident, the Indianapolis Star reported.

Saez, an apprentice who learned to ride when he was two, was competing in the eighth race when his four-year-old horse apparently clipped the heels of a horse in front of him, track officials believe.

Loss: Juan Saez, 17, suffered head trauma after he was thrown from his horse during a race on Tuesday

Saez was thrown from the horse as it fell, and the horse and rider behind them also tumbled.

An ambulance service operating at the track rushed to his aid and he had to be revived 'about three or four times', his agent Julio Espinoza told the Daily Racing Form.

He was then airlifted to IU Health Methodist Hospital but he succumbed to his injuries. He was pronounced dead at Methodist just before 11 p.m.

No other riders were taken to hospital but Montezuma Express was euthanized. 

The Indiana Horse Racing Commission's Board of Stewards is reviewing the incident.

Following the tragedy, Indiana Grand Casino officials canceled the final race of the evening. 

Rising star: Saez, who was from Panama, had been racing horses with his brother since he was two

Saez, a promising young jockey from Panama City, had graduated from Laffit Pincay Jr. Jockey Training Academy in Panama, and hoped to follow in the footsteps of his brother, jockey Luis Saez.

'That's why I went to jockey school,' he explained. 'But I also want to be better than my brother.'

In an interview last summer, his agent, Julio Espinoza, described the boy's talent.

'As soon as I saw him work a horse the first time, I was really stunned,' he told the Courier-Journal.

'I said, "Man, I got the real deal here." Because he acted like he'd been here 10 years.

'My biggest surprise was the patience he's got. He doesn't freak out if a horse breaks bad. If they send him to the lead and (another) horse goes in front of him, he doesn't get excited. He just sits there.'

Saez explained in the article that he had been racing his brother on horses since he was two, and that their father often became exasperated when they wore out the animals.

Of his move to the U.S., he added: 'It's so exciting. I never thought I'd be riding for the kind of people I'm riding for. It's a dream come true.'

Earlier this year, Saez was involved in a similar incident when his horse threw him forward and nearly dumped him over the rail at Ellis Park in Kentucky.

He was applauded afterwards for regaining his composure to stay on board, despite the near-fall, the Star reported.
