Jamie Donaldson has booked his place in the European team at this year's Ryder Cup after winning the D+D REAL Czech Masters by two shots.

The Welshman held off the challenge of his countryman Bradley Dredge to scoop the 166,660 euros (£128,000) prize money and qualify via the European list.

The 38-year-old hit six birdies and carded a four-under-par 68 to reverse a two-shot deficit behind Dredge after a third-round 71 saw him slip behind after leading following the first two days at the Albatross Golf Resort in Prague.

Ryding ambition: Jamie Donaldson qualifies for the European Ryder Cup team after his Czech Masters win

At the start of the week he needed 30,000 euros (£24,000) from the Prague tournament and next week's Italian Open to ensure he tees off at Gleneagles without fighting a host of other names for qualification from the world points list.

Donaldson was in a strong position to do that anyway and occupied the eighth of nine automatic spots, but his victory in the Czech Republic means he no longer has to worry about Graeme McDowell, Luke Donald, Ian Poulter and Stephen Gallacher breathing down his neck.

"This is big - it's been an amazing week," he told the European Tour website.

Determined: Donaldson hit three back-to-back birdies to start his final day round helping him secure victory

"I needed to play well either this week or next week, or both, to guarantee my place in The Ryder Cup Team so there was a lot on the line and this week I played really well, so that's great."

Donaldson hit three back-to-back birdies to start his round in style and picked up a further shot, with bogeys on the fourth and 17th holes, to nudge him to 14 under overall and past Dredge, who could only manage a par 72 after dropping shots on the third and 17th holes.

The victory is Donaldson's third European Tour title and he savoured the moment afterwards, adding: "Winning is everything: wins shoot you up world rankings, Race To Dubai, all sorts. It's massive - those three last holes coming in there were really tough with the wind blowing, so I'm just really happy to seal it.

"It's so difficult to get into the team, the lads are playing so well. You know that you have to play well to secure your place and it did come down to the wire. But that's how it is to get into the team - I played as well as I can play for 18 months, and then a couple of slow events and you rocket down the list, so it's great to come here and play so well and do enough to get into the team."

Dredge finished one ahead of Soren Kjeldsen and South African Merrick Bremner to be a runner-up for the second time in as many weeks, but the 41-year-old is not too disheartened and congratulated Donaldson.

Belly up: Donaldson's win here was his third European Tour title and he will now shoot up the world rankings

"I was trying to keep the pressure on and try to force the other guys into mistakes, but to be fair to Jamie he played great and I'm pleased he's secured his place in the Ryder Cup," he said.

Gallacher, meanwhile, finished in a share of seventh on seven under and the Scot still needs a good performance in Italy to book his own place on Paul McGinley's team at the Ryder Cup.

He said: "The week went pretty well - bit disappointed with today, I didn't really play that well," said Gallacher, "but top ten if you're not firing is quite good."
