After 11 years with the Arizona Cardinals, veteran defensive end Darnell Dockett will remain in the NFC West after signing a two-year deal with the San Francisco 49ers. 

Coming off an ACL tear which ruled him out for the entire 2014 season, the exuberant 33-year-old has vowed to become the Comeback Player of the Year.

The deal, worth $7.5million, will see  $4m paid in the first season and $2m guaranteed, according to ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.

Dockett joins new head coach Jim Tomsula and a 49ers defense which could be without 15-year veteran Justin Smith, who is considering retirement.
