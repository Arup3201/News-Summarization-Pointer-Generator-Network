Monty Python star Terry Jones has secretly married the Swedish lover he left his wife of 42 years for.

Jones, 71, revealed yesterday that he tied the knot a year ago with dancer Anna Soderstrom, 30, in a ceremony attended by just five people.

The couple met when she asked him to autograph a book soon after she arrived in England in 2002 to study modern languages at Hertford College, Oxford.

Tied the knot: Monty Python star Terry Jones revealed that he married his Swedish girlfriend Anna Soderstrom, 41 years his junior, last year

He divorced his wife, Alison  Telfer,
 last year, although he said he found the split ‘very hard’ and insists 
he still loves the former biochemist.

Jones,
 who has a four-year-old daughter, Siri, with his new wife, said: ‘We 
married last year. The divorce came through – sadly – so we got married.

Low key: Jones (centre) and his bride had just five wedding guests, deciding not to ask Monty Python members John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin (right to left)

‘We kept it secret. We wanted to keep it quiet from the Press.’

Fan turned lover: Jones met Soderstrom at a book signing in Oxford when she was in her early twenties

To
 keep it low key, the couple did not invite their families or the other 
Pythons, he said, adding: ‘It was a very small wedding – only my 
daughter and the next-door neighbours came.’

They
 were married by a registrar at Highgate Literary and  Scientific 
Institution near their home in North London.

But he said that now he was
 in his seventies, they would not be having more children, adding: ‘Anna
 is cool about it – she doesn’t really want to. We think Siri is 
enough.’

The Welshman 
revealed that a thief raided their hotel room during their honeymoon in 
Paris and stole Soderstrom’s wallet containing cards and cash.

He said: 
‘We went to Paris and we got burgled in our hotel suite. We had to move 
hotels.

‘There was somebody
 in the room when we came back from dinner.

'Anna said she saw a hand 
disappearing through the toilet door so they must have been in the room 
as we went back in.

'And they must have hidden in the loo.

‘The
 other hotel we moved into upped our room because they said, “We don’t 
want you to think all hotels are going to be burgled”.’

Jones,
 who once said his hobby was sex, reportedly had an open marriage with 
Telfer, with whom he has two adult children. But his affair with a 
Swedish beauty 41 years his junior proved too much for his ex-wife.

Spice up their love life: About a year into their relationship Soderstrom was photographed belly-dancing, saying that she joined a university Middle Eastern dance society because Jones enjoyed sex games and role play

No more children: Jones (pictured in 1979 film Life of Brian) has a four-year-old daughter with Soderstrom

Around
 a year after meeting Soderstrom, she was photographed with a 
belly-dancing troupe in Oxford, having joined the university’s Middle 
Eastern Dance Society, apparently because Jones enjoys role play and 
wanted to spice up their love life.

Anna’s
 father Torbjorn Soderstrom, who is a surgeon, supports the 
relationship. He said: ‘I’ve never been against it in any sort of way.

‘I’m
 very fond of Terry. I’ve been a Monty Python fan since I was a kid.

'I 
have no opinion on the age difference. Relationships are not about 
that.’

Jones and Anna are 
said to be excited about his recently-announced stage reunion with 
fellow Pythons Michael Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese and Terry Gilliam.

Jones
 said that although it was billed as a one-off, it could lead to a 
series of reunions for the Flying  Circus team, with another five 
already rumoured.

He added: ‘There’s an indefinable air that we might do more shows.’
