A generation of singletons have lived their lives by the self-help relationship manual 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'.

Detailing the essential differences between the sexes, the book, written by John Gray in 1992 became an international best seller.

But it appears the forerunner for the book was actually penned 350 years ago, as a text comes to light explaining the fundamental differences in men and women when it comes to love and romance. 

The forerunner for the 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' book that was written 350 years ago has come to light

The text is called 'The Art How to Known Men' and outlines the physical and emotional differences between the two sexes, as seen in the Victorian period

Written to help those in the Jacobean period understand each other, the text is called 'The Art How to Known Men' and attempts to outline the physical and emotional differences between the two sexes, as perceived in the Victorian period.

It was originally written in French but was translated into English in 1665 by an author named John Davies.

Originally written in French, the book reveals that single women had many of the same concerns over 100 years ago

The book, which was discovered on a shelf, will be sold at Dukes in Dorchester for an estimated £300

As well as chapters on the soul (that is generally ‘inclined towards good’), the book contains a detailed section on the physical differences between men and women and on the different types of men a woman may meet in her quest for love.

It compares the male form to that of a lion, with large mouths, thick hair and hard and musculous flesh.

Women, on the other hand have a 'fair appearance which hides an infinite multitude of defects' including weakness, jealousy, distrust and ungratefulness.

While men were built with 'heat and drought' women 'received a little more 'cold and moisture'.

The author, John Davies, goes on the describe other physical differences between the two genders.

He describes woman as being 'lower and smaller' than man and that her eyes are large and black 'betraying a certain mildness and modesty'.

He stated that weakness appeared in the female voice and 'all her motions'

The rare book has spent years gathering dust on a shelf at a house in Dorset.

The owner had no idea what it was until he took it to Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, Dorset.

Amy Brenan, a spokeswomen for Duke's, said: 'This could well be the first 'Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus' book. It is a really early piece of social history.

'It forms the basis of what we now see as men and women, although nowadays the lines are much more blurred than they were back then.

'In the 17th century there was a definite distinction between the sexes and people genuinely believed what they read in this book.

'However, the book does try to question these beliefs so it would have been quite radical for the time.

'There are chapters in the book dedicated to the physical, mental and emotional differences between the sexes.

'When we read this book in the 21st century where women are equal to men, the author's description of either sex is almost comedic, however, it was intended as a serious text.

'At the time there would have been many versions printed but over time they may have been thrown away or lost.'

The introduction to the small, leather-bound book explains it is '...an Art, comprehending whatever contributes to the discovery of their most secret inclinations, the motions of their souls, their virtues and their vices. An Art, which will bring to those that shall attain it the greatest satisfaction and advantages imaginable.'

It is to be sold at Dukes in Dorchester, Dorset, for an estimated £300 on April 10.
