A woman tasked with not saying sorry for an entire week has shared what she learned from the eye-opening experiment.

New York-based journalist Gabrielle Moss wrote on Bustle.com that before giving up the word, she didn't realize the extent to which she had been using it 'as a way of seeming less powerful, or as a way of showing my subservience to someone more powerful than me.' 

Having to avoid saying 'sorry' opened her eyes to the tendency of women to over-apologize, especially in the workplace.

No apologies: Journalist Gabrielle Moss, who was tasked with not saying sorry for an entire week, has shared what she learned from the eye-opening experiment

'Though I've worried for a long time that I'm not good or smart enough to make it in the professional world, before this experiment, I never realized that I was expressing this to my bosses by constantly apologizing to them,' she writes. 

Indeed, while Gabrielle expected to have a tough time not apologizing to friends and her boyfriend for emotional reasons or to strangers for public clumsiness, the real problem was at work.

Gabrielle found that she had been saying 'sorry' to bosses and co-workers as a means of expressing and acknowledging her own inadequacy.

Instead of explaining why a story she was working on was late, for instance, she would apologize out of the fear of being looked down upon.

'A "sorry" to an editor about a late piece really meant "I feel that I’m an impostor, and I’m terrified you'll never work with me again upon discovering that I'm not perfect and am turning this piece in late,"' she explains.

During the experiment, she made an effort to find alternatives to 'sorry'. For example, instead of apologizing for a late article, she simply told her editor that it would be in soon. 

'I found that explaining what was actually going on, instead of just offering a reflexive "sorry," didn't seem to annoy her, or anyone else, the way I had anticipated,' she says. 

This tendency to over-apologize is shared among the female sex, says Gabrielle. 'We're raised to give out insincere apologies that are actually just displays of power and subservience from the time we're little kids,' she writes. 

She notes the different ways in which men and women ask for things at work, with women usually beginning the conversation with, 'Sorry for bothering you,' while men just go straight to the point.

While over-apologizing isn't doing women any favors in the workplace, taking it to the opposite extreme is just as detrimental.

This is 'the great irony of women in any position of power,' says Gabrielle. 'Apologize constantly, and everyone says you’re annoying, sniveling, have low self-esteem; never apologize, and you're just a b****. 

'It's a set of standards that are so deeply culturally ingrained, it’s tough not to believe them about yourself.'

Through her experiment, Gabrielle learned that it's possible - even beneficial - to function at work without apologizing whenever anything goes wrong.

'Instead of protecting me, my "sorries" eroded me,' she says. 'I don't know if permanently cutting back on them will completely change my life, but I think it'll help me realize that my existence isn't something that I need to apologize for.'
