These two bangles that could be mistaken for cheap glow-bands have sold for an incredible £3.7million pounds.

The bright green bands are a far cry from the plastic bracelets commonly seen in nightclubs and are actually made from an extremely rare gemstone.

They were carved from a huge piece of jadeite found in Burma, which is the most expensive and rarest form of the gemstone jade.

Jade a fortune: The bangles were carved from a huge piece of jadeite, which is the most expensive and rarest form of the gemstone jade

As almost all of the world's jadeite is found in the small country, the mines have been exhausted and top quality pieces now sell for huge sums of money.

The bracelets, which are just two inches in diameter, are a translucent green colour, which is a shade considered to be one of the most prized forms of the precious stone.

They were purchased by a phone bidder at the Tiancheng International Auctioneers sale in Hong Kong for an all-in fee of £3,732,365.

Ellen Sin, director of the jewellery department, said: 'Around 99 per cent of the top quality jadeite is only found in Burma, including this pair of jadeite bangles.

'As the supply of high grade jade keeps dropping and the mines are being exhausted, exquisite jadeites become highly sought after.

'They were carved from the same piece of rough and each highly translucent cylindrical jadeite bangle is suffused with a rich bright green colour.

'Their size is large and as they were carved from the same rough, it would have had to be very big so that there was enough material to carve two similar bangles.

'The two bangles have a fine texture and translucent with very few impurities, the most desired quality of jadeite.

'It is so rare to find a big rough with very fine quality texture.

'They are top quality and when they are carved from the same piece of rough they are invaluable jewels.

'As its appreciation overtakes that of diamond and gold, this makes jadeite greatly favoured among the wealthy who regard it as one of the major investment items.

'The beauty, rarity and unique locality of fine jadeite contribute to its collectible value.'
