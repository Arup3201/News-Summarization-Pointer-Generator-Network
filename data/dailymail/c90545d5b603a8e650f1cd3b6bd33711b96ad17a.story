Little did Marion Bartoli and Andy Murray realise when they celebrated their Wimbledon titles at the Champion’s Ball last year that they would soon have something else in common - coach Amelie  Mauresmo.

Mauresmo was in Bartoli’s corner when she unexpectedly won Wimbledon as a 125-1 outsider at the age of 28, and now she has been handpicked by Murray to help him retain his singles title at SW19 in a week’s time.

It is a decision that has caused shockwaves throughout the sporting world - the first time a leading men’s player has appointed a woman to be his coach. But Bartoli, able to give a unique insight into how the 34-year-old works, believes it is a move that will allow Murray to cope with the added pressure of being the first Briton to try and retain the men’s singles title at Wimbledon since Fred Perry in the Thirties.

Happy times ahead: Andy Murray's decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo as his coach was brave but not surprising says last year's Wimbledon champion Marion Bartolli

Bartoli says: ‘I think it was an extremely brave choice by Andy because it’s the first time it’s happened. But I am not surprised by it because Andy is so smart and he’s never been afraid of taking risks.

‘It’s the right decision. Amelie was an important reason why I became a Wimbledon champion.

‘One of her main strengths is how she is able to deal with stress and transmit positive energy to her players. She has experience of winning Grand Slams herself. She is able to give great tactical advice without being in your face all the time. She’s got the presence where she doesn’t have to speak too often but when she does, you automatically listen.’

Bartoli only appointed Mauresmo to replace her father as main coach four months before last year’s Wimbledon and the impact was immediate. ‘She didn’t like me getting ready for each match too early,’ Bartoli says. ‘We’d do a little bit on tactics the night before, she’d ask how I was feeling about my game, but generally it wasn’t anything intense. Then 25 minutes before the match, the real warm-up began and you become this competitive tennis player.’

For those who worry that Mauresmo might be too austere for Murray’s quirky sense of humour, Bartoli assures us the Frenchwoman is a relaxed figure away from the public gaze, a bit like Murray’s previous coach Ivan Lendl who was a joker off-court while maintaining his stonewall persona when the cameras were on him watching matches.

Bartoli adds: ‘She really is a lot of fun. Our thing we’d do was to mimic pieces of dialogue in famous French films. It was all spontaneous, and would keep the tension away.’

Pyschologically, Mauresmo’s input was most keenly felt 12 months ago when Bartoli came through a rain-interrupted quarter-final against America’s Sloane Stephens. At one point, they were off court for two hours, Bartoli winning the key points when they resumed, one a 27-shot rally on her way to a 6-4 7-5 victory.

‘Amelie just kept me relaxed, assured me I was playing well, that if I kept the ball in play, I’d win,’ explains Bartoli. ‘Looking back, it was a big part of my success.

Murray’s decision to have a woman in charge of his preparations will be one of the most-scrutinised stories of Wimbledon, particularly after his early exit at Queen’s. Australian player Marinko Matosevic spoke for the sceptics last week when he said: ‘For me, I couldn’t do it (appoint a female coach) since I don’t think that highly of the women’s game.’

It’s ironic that France is at the centre of a new era in sport when it’s not historically been regarded as a bastion of women’s liberation. French Ligue 2 football team Clermont Foot appointed a female coach, Helena Costa, as their manager in May – the highest-profile club ever to do so.

Now, a Frenchwoman Mauresmo has been entrusted with Murray’s Wimbledon chances. ‘The message is extremely positive,’ says Bartoli. ‘I am very proud to be French at a time when our country is getting more women involved in sport.’

More modestly, Bartoli can’t say whether her own experiences with Mauresmo helped persuade Murray to appoint her, though it should be pointed out Bartoli is good friends with the player’s mother, Judy.

While Murray will begin his Wimbledon defence a week on Monday, Bartoli will be a spectator, having decided to retire after winning her maiden Grand Slam. She has been invited into the Royal Box on Tuesday.

‘Last year was a happy time - an amazing feeling of fun,’ she recalls. Something she hopes Mauresmo can transmit to Murray this year.
