An umpire has been banned from refereeing a cricket match between the Church of England and the Vatican over fears he might be 'biased' as his great-great grandfather was an Anglican bishop.

Michael Claughton, 65, was told he 'could not be considered' because organisers wanted a 'theologically neutral' umpire such as an atheist.

The member of Bethersden Cricket Club, Kent, said he was baffled when told he was 'unsuitable' for the match because his is related to Thomas Claughton, a former Bishop of Rochester and St Albans.

He said: 'It's bonkers. This is church bureaucracy gone mad. They said to me - we'll probably be looking for a Methodist or an atheist.

'It's amazing really, I thought they would be glad to have my services, but they said I might be considered biased against the Catholics.'

Mr Claughton, the deputy leader of the Conservatives at Ashford Borough Council, added: 'People know me and I'm very well known in the cricketing world. It's been part of my life since I was knee-high to a bee.

'I really did question their reason for refusing me.

'It's as though someone's going to get out and I say 'no because of my ancestor in the 19th century' - it's never going to happen.'

Paul Handley, the editor of Church Times, confirmed that Mr Claughten had been 'bowled out', adding: 'It's perfectly true.

'We wanted to be careful that the match is seen to be completely fairly played.'

Mr Claughton says he believes in God but has not held any positions within the church like his great-great grandfather.

He said he was disappointed with the decision and surprised by the response from organisers.

'The greatest unfulfilled ambition of my life is to never have opened the batting for England,' said Mr Claughton.

'My offer was made in good faith and it would have been a huge honour to umpire the match. I just don't know how they are going to find these umpires, are they going to ask people what faith they are?'

The Rev Claughton was made bishop of Rochester in 1867 and of St Albans in 1877.

He was also a professor of poetry at Oxford University between 1852 and 1857.
