Newcastle midfielder Siem de Jong has said his rehabilitation from injury will take at least another eight weeks.

De Jong was a £6million arrival from Ajax in the summer but he suffered a major setback almost immediately when he suffered a serious thigh injury just three games into his Magpies career.

The initial prognosis was that he would not be fit to return until after Christmas and that does not appear to have altered significantly during his time on crutches.

Newcastle's attacking midfielder de Jong posted on Facebook he has been ruled out for a further two months

The 25-year-old Holland international posted an upbeat message on his Facebook page but admitted he was still a long way from returning.

It read: 'On my way back to Newcastle. Just saw the surgeon in London and all looks good.

'I can slowly start building up strength again and start walking without crutches. Still a couple of months to go but I'm going to work hard and I'm sure I will get back stronger!'

De Jong posted this photo on Instagram showing himself on crutches at the beginning of the month
