Boris Johnson last night launched a crowd-pleasing demand for a return to grammar schools.

The London Mayor sought to boost his standing with the Tory faithful by announcing his ‘strong belief in competitive education’ and selective admissions.

It is the first time in more than a decade that a Conservative heavyweight has advocated a return to selection.

There was a scrum of TV crews, photographers, reporters and fans waiting for Boris Johnson at Birmingham New Street Station

Mr Johnson, who does not control the 
 capital’s schools, again hinted at his  prime ministerial ambitions by 
saying he was not able to shape party policy in  education ‘yet’.

He was given a rock star reception at the Birmingham conference.

A crowd chanting ‘Boris, Boris, Boris’ gathered at New Street station when he arrived by train and he faced a scrum of delegates and media at the conference hotel.

At a rally in his honour attended by around 1,000 grassroots Tories, Mr Johnson said: ‘I’m a strong believer in competitive education. What was the Olympics? It was a pageant of competition. We should be allowing children to compete academically.

‘I personally have no objections to selective admissions at some stage.’

He said ‘some people object’ to the 11 plus, which divides pupils at that age, but he said it should be possible to select at later ages. And in a clear hint that he wants a wider national role, Mr Johnson concluded: ‘As far as party policy is concerned I’m not in a position to do this – yet.’

He also said he would continue to 
speak out in favour of a new hub airport, an idea the Coalition has 
punted into the long grass.

His provocative intervention on 
education may not please David Cameron, who decided against reopening 
the grammar school debate back in 2007.

Conference: Boris Johnson takes centre stage

But not everyone has been swept up in Boris-mania. Veteran minister Ken Clarke today said Mr Johnson had to grow up.

'If he really wants to be a 
prime minister for serious reasons and not just getting his picture in 
the paper more often, he really does have to settle down and demonstrate
 he can seriously deliver on some complicated subjects,' he told a meeting hosted by 
Channel 4 on the fringe of the conference.

He added it would be 'disastrous' if Mr Johnson could not get the 'fashionable' speculation under control.

Health minister Anna Soubry also played 
down the idea that the public was gripped by Borismania: 'Not one person
 in my constiuency ever has said anything to me about Boris.'

But the Boris Johnson circus still threatened to overshadow the main keynote speech today from Chancellor George Osborne.

Mr Johnson refused to say 
if Mr Cameron was a better Prime Minister than he would be, insisting 
the claim was ‘unverifiable’.

And  the London Mayor used his 
newspaper column to claim the government had left the 'struggling 
middle' feeling 'utterly ignored.

Last night he addressed hundreds of supporters at a rally organised by the ConservativeHome website under the triumphal banner 'Re-elected and Olympotastic'.

He was careful to praise Mr Cameron, and said he was one of the first Tory MPs to back him as party leader.

The London Mayor said the Conservative party had to remain squarely on the centre ground and claim back the One Nation mantra from Ed Miliband.

But he refused to rule out publicly challenging policy drawn up by the coalition.

Mr Johnson said: ’Of course I am going to fight what I think might be ill-conceived Lib Dem plans for a mansion tax when I read about it.

'Of course I am I going to continue to lobby for a long overdue solution to our aviation capacity problems.

The rise and rise of his old friend has given David Cameron plenty to think about while in the conference hall earlier today

'No-one, as a result of that, should have any cause to doubt my admiration of David Cameron.

'He, George Osborne and the government are doing exactly what is needed to clean up the country and the mess Labour left.'

But
 in a direct challenge to Mr Cameron he warned against thinking a third 
runway at Heathrow would solve Britain's aviation capacity crisis.

'I say to my friends who secretly think a third runway:you need to move away from that idea.

'None of these solutions is easy but we can't do is turn a blind eye to what is happening in other European countries.'

And he raised the prospect of a return to grammar schools, an issue which threatened to destabilise Mr Cameron's leadership in 2007.

'I am a strong believer in competitive education,' Mr Johnson said. 'We should be able to allow children to compete academically in my view in that way.

'I personally have no objection to selective admissions at some stage in a child's development.'

The success of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games on his watch has boosted Mr Johnson's popularity just as Mr Cameron's has waned.

Mr Johnson joked: 'I sometimes think after the great success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is we need more things like it. What's next? The Politicians Olympics.'

'Jeremy Hunt would be wanging the bell end. Me for the zip wire, Seb Coe for the 800m, William Hague for the judo.

'And Ed Miliband for the high jump.'

The remarkable scenes as Mr Johnson arrived in Birmingham contrast with the 
low key arrival of Mr Cameron at the conference centre on Saturday and 
confirm Mr Johnson's reputation as political box office.

Asked if he was in Birmingham to make trouble for Prime Minister, Mr Johnson replied: 'I'm here to support the party.'

He ignored further questions as he was chased through the hotel.

Then today he will make a more traditional speech from the main conference stage.

Mr
 Cameron has been repeatedly forced to answer questions about the threat
 to his leadership posed by his old schoolfriend from Eton.

This week the PM said he 'was relaxed
 about having the blond haired mop sounding off from time to time' after
 Mr Johnson challenged him over Europe, aviation policy and tax.

On
 Sunday a a survey by pollsters Opinium for The Observer gave Mr Johnson
 him a net +30 rating among voters, compared to -21 for the Prime 
Minister.

Asked if he was planning to make trouble for David Cameron, the London Mayor replied: 'I'm here to support the party.'

The extraordinary scenes confirm Mr Johnson's reputation as the Tory party's biggest star
