When it first hit the shelves back in 2009, Borderlands was an instant hit.

It wasn't long before the space western picked up numerous awards, including Game Of The Year, for seamlessly blending role-playing elements with traditional first-person gunplay.

Borderlands 2 is set five years after the events of its predecessor. Back then, the vault hunters exposed the secrets of the Eridian Vault.

All hands on deck: You can team-up with friends to take on waves of enemies

The main baddie is Handsome Jack who has taken the credit for the vault hunters' hard work and claimed the wealth from the vault, allowing him to take control of the Hyperion Cooperation and effectively Pandora, too.

The Cooperation has taken the vault hunters hostage, so your mission is to save them and kill Handsome Jack in the process.

Like in the previous game, there are four playable characters.

First up is Salvador, nicknamed 'Gunzerker' who can duel-wield any combination of guns.

Borderlands is known for having millions of weapons - all of which are customisable. It's great to have a character that can carry loads and really make the most out of a fantastic armory.

Then there's the Siren, Maya, who has the ability to phase lock. This is basically lifting an enemy up in the air and making them an easy target.Â

Finally, there's a commando called Axton who relies on turrets and an assassin called Zero, who uses a sword and a gun to unleash a critical hit on his foes.

There's also a character called the Mechromancer - which is due to come out post launch as DLC content. It's free for people who pre-order the game.

Its main ability is to summon a robot called Deathtrap who goes on a rampage killing everybody in sight.

Borderlands impressed critics with its cell-shaded, quirky graphics depicting a Mad Max-style world for the player to explore. But things have been upgraded this time around.

Visuals look sharper and characters seem more richly detailed. Draw distance, as always, is impressive, which helps immerse you in the world.

Borderlands is at its best as a cooperative shooter. Here, you can team up with friends and take on missions together sharing loot and weapons.

Like the original, there are lots of vehicles available to make the most of the mechanic.

What's brilliant this time around are the large boss fights - which are similar to those found in games such as the Monster Hunter series.

We watched as a team took on a huge beast, which tried to splatter them all with its ferocious tentacles.

Levelling up is key here and inexperienced players will die very quickly.

Don't expect the boss fights to be short, either. Developers Gearbox Software have mentioned some can last up to 20mins - with even the slightest of mistakes resulting in total annihilation.

We can't wait for this one.
