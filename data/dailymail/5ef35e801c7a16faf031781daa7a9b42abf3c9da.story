Spooky fun: Nearly two-thirds of children will take to the streets around October 31 for an evening of 'trick or treating'

Halloween is now the second most popular family occasion behind Christmas with parents spending more than £100 on parties for their children this year.

Despite increased costs and family budgets under pressure with rising fuel and food prices, the survey of 2,000 parents also revealed that families are still willing to splash out on ghoulish parties.

The poll found that a family spends an average £73 on food, decorations and other items for each party that they throw throughout the year.

But at Halloween they are happy to go further, spending an extra £42 on ghoulish items such as sweets for 'trick or treaters', fancy dress costumes, accessories and decorations.

The survey found that Halloween came 
in ahead of other traditional family occasions including Easter, 
Eurovision, Bonfire Night and even beat childrens' birthday parties.

However,
Christmas remains the top family occasion with 62 per cent of families 
saying they will be celebrating with a festive party this year.

More than one in three families will celebrate the spooky season by throwing a party this year, according to the survey.

The rise in the popularity of Halloween in Britain is reflected in the colossal growth on the amount of money spent which has soared by 2,300 per cent over the last 10 years to be now worth £280million.

Nearly two-thirds of children will 
take to the streets around October 31 for an evening of 'trick or 
treating' with a potential 24,900,000 doors being knocked on, according 
to the poll.

More than half
of all mothers and fathers will join in the fun this Halloween and 
accompany their children as they walk through neighbouring streets 
dressed as ghouls, ghosts and wizards.

The survey, which was carried out by Woolworths.co.uk and looked at the party habits of British families, also
found that on average each parent will attend four parties this year 
and will consume 1,231 calories in the form of traditional foods 
including toffee apples, sweets and pumpkin pies.

The average parent will also dance for 57 minutes at each party they attend and will burn 352 calories.

The top searched Halloween costumes in 2010 were Disney characters, Lady Gaga and pirates.

This year Woolworths.co.uk predicts 'superheroes' costumes to be the most popular choice following the blockbuster successes of Green Lantern, Captain America and X Men: First Class.

Batman costumes are predicted to be particularly popular with people looking forward to the cinema release of Dark Knight Rises.

Vampire costumes are also expected to be in demand coinciding with the hype surrounding the latest Twilight film Breaking Dawn which is due in cinemas next month.
