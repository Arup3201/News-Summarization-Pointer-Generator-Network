Finding a dreaded yellow traffic note under your windscreen is bad enough... but it's far more embarrassing when you're a policeman.

Yet that was the sight that greeted one officer when he returned to his van in the town centre car park in Llandovery, Carmarthenshire yesterday.

Motorists watched as the Dyfed-Powys patrolman grabbed what appeared to be a parking ticket - yellow, bordered by black marking, containing the word 'penalty' - from the front of his vehicle, which was not in one of the officially marked bays.  

A Dyfed-Powys police officer returned to his van in Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, to find what appeared to be a parking ticket on his windscreen. The vehicle was in a council-run car park where he had been on patrol

Shopper Rhiannon Jones, 46, said: 'It's not every day you see a parking ticket slapped on a police vehicle. 

'Everyone was praising the brave traffic warden for booking the police for parking outside the white lines in the car park.

'The warden was nowhere to be seen when the officer arrived back at his van.

'But people were waiting with their mobile phones to capture the moment on camera.'

Dyfed-Powys Police today denied the officer had been hit with a £60 ticket for illegally parking in the car park. A spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the police vehicle pictured in Llandovery was not issued with a parking ticket'

The town was on high alert at the time as it prepared for a visit by Prince Charles, who was opening an extension to a local factory.

Mother-of-three Mrs Jones said: 'Perhaps the traffic warden was being a bit over-zealous because royalty was in town.

'But the officer didn't look very pleased as he pulled the plastic bag from under his wiper.' 

Dyfed-Powys Police today denied the officer had been hit with a £60 ticket for illegally parking in the council-run car park.

A spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the police vehicle pictured in Llandovery was not issued with a parking ticket.

'The officers in the van were on patrol in the car park, and the parking enforcement officer left a note for them within a parking charge envelope.

'There have been issues with anti-social driving in the car parks, and officers parking there and patrolling the area act as a deterrent.'
