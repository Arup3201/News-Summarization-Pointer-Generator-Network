Police arrested Antonio Flores for allegedly stabbing his roommate multiple times for making too much noise while having sex with two women

Police say they found the roommate, whom they didn't identify, at the shared home in San Antonio suffering from multiple stab wounds to the head, back and arms, according to KHOU.com.

He was taken to the hospital, where he was treated for his injuries.

The incident began when Flores's roommate celebrated his 36th birthday by having a threesome with two women.

Flores, infuriated by the loud sex sounds he was hearing, kicked down the door to his roommate's bedroom and demanded he stop making so much noise.

The roommate refused and told Flores to leave.

He did so but returned a moment later with a knife from the kitchen and stabbed his flatmate several times.
