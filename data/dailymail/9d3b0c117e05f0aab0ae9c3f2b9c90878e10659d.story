Reality
 TV star and one-time Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is out with a new 
op-ed today bashing President Barack Obama for participating in 
'frivolous, inefficient, über-partisan, distracting events' instead of 
solving America's problems.

Palin
 pointed to Obama's schedule of activities during a trip to Denver, 
Colorado, earlier this week as proof of his misplaced priorities.

'President Obama was absolutely swamped the other night, staving off the 
munchies at a pizza party in the Mile High city, hobnobbing as headliner
 at numerous Democrat shindigs, collecting big bucks from big donors all
 day,' Palin, a Fox News contributor, wrote on FoxNews.com.

'Whew. Racking balls, getting buzzed on suds, maybe humming “Rocky 
Mountain High” while kicking it in those Rockies, hard choices had to be
 made – stripes or solids?

'And
 that beer – do I drink it if the 
mountains aren’t blue? Talk about miscues,' Palin continued, colorfully 
giving her version of the president's night out on the town with 
Colorado Governor 
John Hickenlooper, whom she refers to in the piece as 
'Hickensooperdooper.'

Obama
 ran into the Democratic Governor on Tuesday night at a bar in Denver, 
and the two had a beer together and played a game of pool, which Obama 
says he won.

Palin
 frequently bashes the president for what she perceives as failed 
leadership, and the fiery former politician had no shortage of 
complaints about Obama's 'offensive' behavior in her op-ed today.

From
 the president's refusal to visit the border during his trip to Texas to the 'fancy talkin’, photo-opin’ and 
fundraisin’ events he held there, Palin snarkily berated the president for nearly everything he did - and didn't do - this week.

'But, seriously, our commander-in-chief is busy, as Rome burns,' she said after making fun of the administration's now-halted plans renovate the White House bowling ally.

She also reprised her claims from earlier this week that Obama should be impeached for his overstepping his authority.

Palin
 first made the charge in an op-ed on Breitbart.com on Tuesday. There, 
she insisted that Obama was deliberately leaving America's border with 
Mexico unsecured because he wants to destroy the country.

'Without borders, there is no nation. Obama knows this,' she wrote.

Today,
 she didn't bother to explain what Obama had done to be thrown out of 
office - 'no need to waste ink trying to educate the 
“deniers” ' - and jumped straight to encouraging her fans to pressure members of Congress who 'denounce Barack Obama as a lawless imperial president 
with a destructively scandal-riddled administration' to draw up articles of impeachment.

Numerous
 Republican lawmakers have teased the idea of impeaching the president, 
but none have introduced legislation to remove him from office.

Part of their hesitation comes from the fact that Democrats currently have a lock on the Senate.

Even
 if Republican-controlled House did indict the president for abusing his
 powers, there's no chance Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a 
Democrat, would allow similar charges to come to the upper chamber's 
floor.

'It’s one of those things that if you can’t see an end solution, why even get into that debate?' Rep. John Fleming told The Hill.

Unless both legislative bodies pass articles of impeachment, the process of booting the president from office cannot move forward.

Palin said on Friday that the House should impeach the president regardless of whether the Senate follows suit.

'If Senators aren’t ballsy enough to use their power of the purse to stop
 this nonsense, then they must hand the baton to the House and support 
our representatives in impeachment proceedings,' she said.

While the majority of Republicans may agree with Palin that Obama should be 
charged with wrongdoing - no recent polling data on the topic exists -
 a recent survey shows Palin isn't the best Republican personality to lead the charge.

A
 Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg Public Policy Center survey taken between June 30 to July 7, a day before Palin took up the impeachment mantle, discovered that 52 percent of Americans want Palin to 
sit down and shut up, including almost two out of every five self-described conservatives.

Palin
 was rated the most annoying former politician in the poll, beating out 
former president Bill Clinton, former civil rights activist Jesse 
Jackson, former Speaker of the House and current Crossfire host Newt 
Gingrich and former vice presidents Al Gore and Dick Cheney for the 
dishonor.
