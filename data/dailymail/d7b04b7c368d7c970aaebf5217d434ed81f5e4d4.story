The Queen has visited HMS Lancaster - known as the Queen’s Frigate - 24 years after she launched it.

The crew welcomed Her Majesty on board the Royal Navy Frigate yesterday as it stopped off at Portsmouth Naval Base.

Dressed elegantly in a sky blue Karl Ludwig dress and a white Angela Kelly hat, the 88-year-old was greeted by the naval base commander Commodore Jeremy Rigby and received a royal salute.

The national anthem played as she inspected a guard of honour, before she met members of the crew and their families on board at a private lunch.

The Queen, who is the ship’s sponsor in her capacity as the Duke of Lancaster, officially launched the Type 23 frigate on May 24, 1990.

Hats off: Queen Elizabeth II receives 'three cheers for Her Majesty' from the ship's company. HMS Lancaster has recently returned from a seven month deployment in the North Atlantic and Caribbean

During its deployment, it was involved in six drugs busts -  detaining 23 drug-runners and seizing 1.2 tonnes of cocaine and nearly 1.5 tonnes of cannabis, which would worth £160 million on the streets of the UK.

The Queen has previously visited the impressive ship in 2004 and 2006. 

Commander Peter Laughton, the ship’s commanding officer, said: ‘We are honoured with a visit from our Lady Sponsor, Her Majesty the Queen, who launched the ship in 1990.

‘It provides us with an excellent opportunity to update Her Majesty on HMS Lancaster’s recent activities including our successful counter-narcotics deployment in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.

‘Throughout this, Lancaster remained poised to respond to any natural disaster and ready to provide life saving support.

‘I am extremely proud of my ship’s company who worked tirelessly over a seven month period on the front line of naval operations and ultimately protecting our nation’s interests.’

Queen Elizabeth II also met members of the Boarding Team who were involved in successful counter-narcotics operations with HMS Lancaster.

Lancaster’s weapon engineer officer Lieutenant Commander Adrian Gubby said: ‘Lancaster has the privilege of being The Queen’s frigate. Seven months was a long time to be away from friends and family, however the success of the deployment made the time away worth it.’

Able seaman Andrew Warry, 19, from Portsmouth, said: ‘I feel really privileged, it’s nice to see it’s getting noticed, that it’s not just a job, it’s a career and you feel a part of something.’

Able Seaman David Yates, 26, of Falkirk, Scotland, said the Queen asked him about his role as a warfare specialist on board HMS Lancaster.

He said: ‘I told her we were responsible for maritime security and radar collision.

‘It’s good to see the sponsor of the ship, it keeps morale high, it’s good publicity for the Royal Navy.’
