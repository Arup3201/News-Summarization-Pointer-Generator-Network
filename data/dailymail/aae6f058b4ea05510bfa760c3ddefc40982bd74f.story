St Helens forward Kyle Amor says Thursday's Super League play-off semi-final against Catalans will be the biggest game of his career.

Amor, who joined Saints from Wakefield this year, scored as Saints routed Castleford 41-0 to reach the last four.

The bearded 27-year-old said: 'You come to big clubs to play in big games and to ultimately win trophies, so these games are the types you want to be tested for.

'It's something I've not done before, so personally it's probably the biggest 80 minutes of my career.

'I was at Wakefield and we got one taste of the play-offs but we were only in for one week; so in terms of experience in the play-offs I'm still only a pup.

'To get to a Grand Final would be something tremendous.'

Nathan Brown's side come into the game having had an extra week off. By contrast, the Dragons' visit to Langtree Park on Thursday will be their third match in a row away from home, but they have won impressively at Leeds and then Huddersfield to get to within one game of a first ever Grand Final.

Nathan Brown said his side will benefit from their week off but it will count for nothing if they don't play well

'There's no doubt that a third flight in a row is tough, and deep down in the back of their mind they know that is tough,' said Brown.

'Us having the week off is definitely an advantage, but none of those things work in your favour if you don't play well.'

Saints are looking to reach their first Grand Final since 2011, having not won the competition since 2006.

After winning 19 of the 27 matches during the regular season, St Helens secured their fifth League Leaders' Shield.

Amor said the purpose of moving to St Helens was to 'play in big games and to ultimately win trophies'

Former Saint Martin Gleeson has announced his retirement from rugby league but will remain with Salford Red Devils in a coaching role.

The 34-year-old former Great Britain centre will take up a position with the Super League club's academy.

'I'm looking forward to my new career, starting with developing the youth of Salford and taking my first steps as a coach,' Gleeson told the club website.
