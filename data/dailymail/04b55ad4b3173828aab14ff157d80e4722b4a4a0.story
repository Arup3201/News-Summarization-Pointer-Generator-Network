A spectacular row broke out last night over Alex Salmond’s alleged attempts to silence a leading Scottish academic who questioned independence.

The first minister tried to force Louise Richardson, Principal of St Andrews University, to tone down warnings about the adverse impact of a Yes vote.

A source said he spent ten minutes attempting to ‘put words in her mouth’.

Leaked emails revealed how the SNP leader’s special adviser, Geoff Aberdein, urged Professor Richardson to attack the Westminster government over funding for higher education, the Daily Telegraph said.

He reportedly emailed her press secretary with a suggested statement, reading: ‘The Scottish Government has risen to the challenge on fees in stark contrast to the government south of the border and I’m sure they can rise to the challenge on research funding as well.’

But in a reply, Professor Richardson wrote: ‘I’m sorry but I’m afraid I cannot agree to this statement.’

It is also claimed the First Minister called Professor Richardson, the first female principal of the 600-year-old institution, and told her to rectify remarks she made about the consequences of Scotland leaving the UK.

Flying solo: The row started in March last year as Professor Richardson warned independence could prove ‘catastrophic’ for St Andrew’s if it threatened access to £3billion of UK scientific grants handed out each year

A source familiar with the conversation said that the First Minister spent 10 minutes attempting to ‘put words in her mouth’ about the impact of independence.

The row started in March last year as Professor Richardson warned independence could prove ‘catastrophic’ for St Andrew’s if it threatened access to £3billion of scientific research handed out each year by the UK.

Prof Richardson added St Andrews was concerned about the funding gap left by English students

She challenged the SNP government’s assumption that an independent Scotland would be able to ‘buy into’ the funds administered by Research Councils UK, which give Scottish universities a lucrative share of national funding.

She told the Times newspaper: ‘If we were cut off from national research councils it would be catastrophic for this institution.

'We would lose our top academics, we would fail to attract serious academics [from other countries].’

Prof Richardson added that St Andrews was concerned about the funding gap that would be left by English students who would no longer be liable to pay their £9,000 tuition fees because they would be treated in the same way as other EU students. 

In November last year, Prof Richardson urged her staff to reject ‘external pressure’ to take a certain stance on independence, and said she was concerned that academics ‘may feel constrained about speaking publicly on the issue or fear adverse consequences if they do’.

In a letter to all members of staff, she wrote: ‘I would very much hope, however, that university staff feel no constraints whatever in expressing their views, whatever they are, on the issue of independence.

‘Indeed I would encourage you to do so. At times of national uncertainty the public justifiably look to universities for reasoned debate and considered argument and I think it incumbent upon us to provide just that.

‘Whether or not my personal views are in accord with yours, any external pressure to limit or suppress debate will stop at my door.’
