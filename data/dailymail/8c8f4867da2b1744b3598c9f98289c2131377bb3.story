Paris Hilton set the trend for designer dogs when she kitted out her teacup Chihuahua Tinkerbell in a blingy juicy couture tracksuit.

And now, pooch owners can follow Paris's lead with the help of a new book which guides pet owners on how to transform their furry friend into the ultimate pampered pooch.

The book, most fittingly titled Diva Dogs, is billed as the definitive guide on how to create your own diamante-studded, designer clothed pet.

The new book offers a step-by-step guide of how to indulge your furry friend

It even comes with detailed instructions on how to throw an 'OTT' pet party - ensuring dog owners pick the perfect venue, shine up their tiaras and a step by step recipe for 'liver lovehearts'.

The prissy pooch bible has been written by celebrity dog owner Louise Harris, who has used her extensive knowledge of pet pampering to create the informative guide.

The book is also a memoir of Louise's infatuation with her own diva dog Lola, who she shot to fame with in TV 'dogumentary' A Different Breed.

Broken up into 10 chapters, Louise explains the dos and don'ts of owning a dog, including 'Doggy dining', 'Divas don't do bad hairdays' and 'Pooch Fancy dress.'

Louise, who owns Britain's most exclusive doggy boutique also offers extensive advice on how to pick a wardrobe and accessories, which will make your pet sparkle.

The book advises dog owners to carry their pooch 'safely' offering ideas for the perfect handbag, car-seat and even pram.

Louise said: 'The book's full of practical tips on day to day doggy care from what to eat to how to stay fit and healthy.

'We explain the dos and don'ts of doggy grooming and, naturally, we also want to share our expertise on chic canine couture, poochie pampering and - my favourite part of all - how to throw a pet party.
