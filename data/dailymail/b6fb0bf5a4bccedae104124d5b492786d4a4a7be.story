Sussex have snapped up England Lions paceman Tymal Mills following his departure from Essex.

The 22-year-old left-arm seamer has signed a two-year contract at Hove, with Sussex claiming to have beaten a number of rivals to his signature.

Mills rejected a new offer from Essex after suffering an injury-plagued 2014 in which he played in only 12 games.

Tymal Mills' raw pace and undoubted potential has led to a battle for his signature, which Sussex have won

The left-armer is capable of bowling at over 90mph, and will hope to develop his game at Sussex

However, his potential is clear thanks to deliveries which can top 90mph, and he left Essex after taking 76 wickets in 59 first-team matches.

'I'm really pleased to be on board,' Mills said of his move. 'As soon as Sussex came in for me, I knew it was a county that I wanted to join. I'm really glad it is all finalised.

'The injuries look to be behind me now and I'm really looking forward to moving down here, getting stuck in this winter and going strong next year.'

The former Essex bowler's pace and form earned him an England Lions call-up earlier this year

Mills, who toured Sri Lanka with the Lions in February, also spent time with the senior England side last winter ahead of the Ashes tour to give England's batsmen practice against left-arm pace bowling.

Sussex's professional cricket manager Mark Robinson, who has worked with Mills in his role with the Lions, said: 'We're hugely excited by the arrival of Tymal. 

'He's a player of enormous potential who is blessed with great pace and a true fast bowler's frame, and we can't wait to see him bowl next season.'
