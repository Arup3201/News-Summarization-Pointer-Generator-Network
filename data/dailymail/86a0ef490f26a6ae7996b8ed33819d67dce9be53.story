Champion Marc Marquez rounded off the 2014 MotoGP campaign in style with a record 13th victory of the year at the Valencia Grand Prix.

The Spaniard's victory in the final race of the championship beat Australian Mick Doohan's record of 12 race wins in a season, set in 1997. 

The Spaniard had already wrapped up the title in Japan last month, but ensured he would end the season on a winning note by climbing from fifth on the starting grid to take the chequered flag by more than three seconds from the rest of the field.

Valentino Rossi wins (2): San Marino, Australia.

Jorge Lorenzo wins (2): Aragon, Japan

Dani Predrosa wins (1): Czech Republic 

Six-time MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi was unable to hold on to pole position in damp conditions and on his Yamaha trailed home behind Marquez, with the result enough to earn him runner-up spot in the title standings.

Dani Pedrosa finished the race third on his Honda, 14 seconds adrift of team-mate and compatriot Marquez.

Italy's Andrea Dovizioso edged out British Ducati team-mate Cal Crutchlow to come home in fourth place, with Spaniard Pol Espargaro rounding off the top six on his Yamaha.
