After helping families tackle domestic violence as a welfare officer, a Sydney woman has herself become an alleged victim of the epidemic.

In a family marred by tragedy, Salwa Haydar became its latest casualty on Monday night when her husband allegedly stabbed the 45-year-old mother to death in their southern Sydney home.

Police accuse Haydar Haydar, 58, of killing his wife some time after 6.30pm, before handing himself into Kogarah police station at 7pm. 

They said the couple's 18-year-old daughter Ola Haydar tried to intervene but suffered serious hand injuries and was taken to hospital.

Salwa Haydar was 'violently' murdered in her Bexley home in Sydney's south on Monday evening

Police have charged Haydar with the murder of his wife and wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm in relation to the injury to his daughter. 

The brutal attack was a shock to former employer, Arab Council CEO Randa Kattan, who knew Mrs Haydar for her work helping other families through domestic violence and troubled times.

'She was very caring, for her family or to her clients,' Ms Kattan told AAP.

'We are absolutely shocked and devastated.'

There had been no indication of domestic violence in Ms Haydar's Bexley home, she said. When she died, Ms Haydar had been working for Quitline.

Mrs Haydar's death comes nine years after her mother was killed in a bombing in southern Lebanon. She was heartbroken when she learned of the loss via a news report.

Her daughter Ola Haydar (pictured) was also injured in the attack, which allegedly took place at the hands of Mrs Haydar's husband Haydar Haydar

'They said one of the people that (was) killed was my mum, and they said her name and I just went in shock. Like ... I screamed, I hit myself, I said, `It can't be my mum',' she told ABC's Lateline at the time.

'I can't believe it, I still can't believe it.'

Superintendent David Donahue said a post mortem revealed the alleged killing was brutal.

'It was quite a violent attack,' he said.

'It's disturbing.' 

The couple's teenager Ola remains in a Sydney hospital where she is being treated by a specialist surgeon.

Haydar will remain in custody following a Kogarah Local Court appearance on Tuesday where he did not apply for bail.

He briefly looked to a group of supporters in court on Tuesday, who left in tears after police led him away.

Magistrate Christine Haskett adjourned the case until April 9 at Central Local Court. Superintendent Donahue said police were still searching for a motive.

'(Domestic violence) is a matter that we deal with the most,' he said.

'We deal with it every day.'

In the 12 months to September 2014, 24 women in NSW were victims of domestic-violence related murders.

In a similar vein Destroy the Joint has been 'counting dead women', in a campaign aimed at highlighting the domestic violence epidemic in Australia.

According to their findings Mrs Haydar is the 26th woman to die a violent death in Australia in 2015 alone. Of those 26, 18 of the deceased knew the alleged perpetrator.
