A Florida man has had his ear partially bitten off by a neighbor for refusing to give him a cigarette, according to police. 

John Ott, of Boca Raton, said he was approached by Alberto Felipe Friday asking him for a smoke.

Before he had a chance to realize what was happening, Ott said his crazed neighbor was tearing at his right ear with his teeth.

Gruesome injury: Ott said Felipe, 31, nearly chomped off a chunk of his ear because he would not offer him a cigarette

‘He comes up puts me in a bear hug and next thing I know he's biting my ear,’ he told the station WPEC-TV.

Felipe, 31, chomped off a chunk of Ott's ear, which was left hanging by a thin strip of cartilage.

The victim was rushed to an area hospital, where doctors were able to save the damaged organ with a few stitches. 

Mr Felipe has been charged with felony aggravated battery, but released on $3,000 bond.

The Boca Raton resident has had several run-ins with the law in the past, including three arrests in Palm Beach County on assault and battery charges.

According to Ott, who resides on Jeffrey Street, his unruly neighbor continuously hurls threats at him from across the street.

The mauled man now plans to file for a restraining order against his mouthy assailant.
