If this week’s USPGA Championship represents the last chance saloon as far as Lee Westwood’s Ryder Cup hopes are concerned, then at least he is heading there with his glass half-full rather than half-empty.

The Englishman shrugged off months of indifferent form on Sunday with a brilliant final round 63 in the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational to give himself a wonderful confidence boost heading to the season’s final major at Valhalla.

‘I felt like it was coming all week but I just kept making silly mistakes over the first three rounds,’ he said. ‘This was a lot more like me, though. I hit the ball really well and now I’ve got some momentum heading to the USPGA.’

Aiming high: Lee Westwood is still confident of making Europe's Ryder Cup team

The bigger picture, of course, is that the USPGA is the last big one with regard to automatic qualifying for the Ryder Cup. Westwood is currently well off the pace but remains defiant.

‘The bigger picture for me is the season’s final major,’ he said. ‘The captain knows what I can do at the Ryder Cup. My record speaks for itself. 

'But quite rightly he wants me to show some form and I think a 63 is form.’
