A golfer has been killed by a crocodile while retrieving balls from a dam called Lake Panic at Kruger National Park in South Africa.

Jacques van der Sandt, 29, was dragged under the water by a crocodile last night and his body was found this morning with teeth marks on his back and chest.

Police said the crocodile attacked Mr van der Sandt as he stood waist-deep in the water, reaching below the surface to feel for golf balls on the bottom of the dam.

Mr van der Sandt is thought to have come into contact with crocodiles before as both of his parents worked at the park

It is understood Mr van der Sandt and a friend had been playing hole nine on Skukuza Golf Club's course, which is played across Lake Panic at the park. 

Skukuza Police spokesman Oubass Coetzer said: 'One guy challenged the other to see who can retrieve the most golf balls.' 

A statement from Kruger National Park said: 'It is understood that a group of youngsters were hanging around after a game of golf when the incident happened.

'Apparently the crocodile surprised the group and snatched the victim, then disappeared under water.' 

It is understood that the park will carry out an internal investigation into the death. 

Local reports suggested that Mr van der Sandt was attacked at around 10pm last night.

Mr van der Sandt's body was found this morning with teeth marks on his chest and back but he had not been 'mutilated'

The crocodiles at the park have just come out of hibernation and were hunting for food, a park official said. Pictured are two crocodiles at Kruger 

Rangers killed the 12ft crocodile at around 4am this morning in the hope they would be able to recover the golfer's body, which was found a few hours later and had not been 'mutilated'.

Mr van der Sandt, a deep sea diver, is thought to have come into contact with crocodiles in the past, having grown up in the park as both his parents worked there. 

Dr Danny Govender, South African National Parks disease ecologist, told News24: 'These animals are not in good condition as they have just come out of hibernation.

'The animal was doing what naturally comes to them; hunting for food and unfortunately a life was lost in the process.'

The victim was the son of park workers Schalk and Lorretha van der Sandt. The couple had been working in the park since 1992, although Schalk is now retired.
