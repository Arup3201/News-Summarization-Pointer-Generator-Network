Manchester United scouts have checked on Portugal midfielder William Carvalho for the eighth time this season.

David Moyes's staff watched the 21-year-old schemer during Sporting Lisbon’s goalless draw with Academica on Sunday evening and their presence was reported in Portuguese newspaper O Jogo.

Carvalho made his debut for Portugal in a World Cup qualifier against Sweden in November and is expected to take a place in Paulo Bento’s squad for Brazil.

His contract expires in 2018 and is understood to contain a release clause in the region of £37.5million, although United would hope to negotiate a considerably cheaper deal.

Real Madrid and Barcelona are also said to be monitoring the powerful midfielder who enjoyed a loan spell with Belgian club Cercle Brugge last season.

Carvalho has scored twice in his 17 club appearances so far this season and his combative style has seen him pick up five bookings.

His presence at United could be necessary if Anderson is to be believed. The midfielder, on loan at Fiorentina, claims there could be an exodus at Old Trafford.

He was quoted by ESPN as saying: 'I'm sure that lots of players want out, especially people like myself and Nani who have been in Manchester for seven or eight years.

'Manchester United is a huge club, a club that does everything for its players but sometimes a footballer wants to leave just to experience a different way to play football, to learn something as well.'
