A young Indiana boy kidnapped to Greece by his father who has been reunited with his mother is enjoying their first holiday season in years.

Leo Zagaris, 12, was kidnapped in 2011 in Greece by father Nick Zagaris during a divorce-settlement mandated visit, he is now enjoying his first holiday season with his mother since returning.

The boy was kept by Nick Zagaris from boarding his return flight home at the end of the visit and wasn’t sure he’d ever make it back to the United States, mother Alissa Zagaris told the Indianapolis Star.

It was the soon-to-be teenager’s fourth visit to Greece, the previous three ended without incident – but the boy’s father decided to keep him during the last visit.

Almost two years later, and after a drawn-out court battle, she was told by the State Department that the Greek Ministry of Justice had ordered Nick Zagaris to return the boy to the US, she told the Star.

He's been home for about nine months.

‘I was just on cloud nine,’ she told Fox 59.

Leo Zagaris agreed.

‘It feels like home,’ he told the station.

Leo took on his first Thanksgiving in three years by starving himself the day before.

‘The day before, he told me he was going to fast all day because he wanted to make sure he had 100 per cent stomach capacity,’ Alissa Zagaris told the Star.

‘I was just so grateful, so happy that he was here,’ she added. ‘There were a couple of times that I teared up when he came in asking ‘Is it almost ready, is it almost ready?’

With Christmas approaching, Leo Zagaris hasn’t let up.

‘It’s kind of going to be like three Christmases,’ he told the Post ‘We’re going to kind of make up for it.’

The youngster has had a little difficulty adjusting to life back home – he was held back a year in school and he misses his friends in Greece.

‘I like being back home with my mom and my little sister but sometimes I feel like I miss Greece,’ he told the Star. ‘I really do miss it because of my dad and my friends there. I love the school there. Life was pretty good there, kind of the same as here.’

Leo keeps in touch with his Greek friends through social media, but his father has cut off all communications since his return.

Alissa Zagaris told the Star that her success in getting Leo back home has prompted her to help others in a similar situation.
