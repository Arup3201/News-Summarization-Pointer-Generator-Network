With two days to go until Remembrance Day, poppies are gracing everyone's lapels. But do you know how much of the money you pay for the poppy actually reaches the British Legion?

The costs of making paper versions are kept low to ensure that 100 per cent of voluntary donations go straight to the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.

But some of the snazzier versions of the little red flower - such as that worn by Gary Barlow on X Factor - are not nearly as benevolent as they first appear.

Kleshna, one of two companies with an exclusive tie-in with the Legion, sells enamelled 
and crystal-clad poppies for up to £59.95 - and has admitted to giving just 
10 per cent of the sales to charity.

Ill-judged? X Factor judges Tulisa wears Kleshna's £18.95 poppy ring, while Gary Barlow sports the designer's £59.95 poppy brooch

However, Buckley, the other firm selling poppies via the Legion's website, is donating all of the profits from its poppies (at least 80 per cent of its sales on the range) to charity.

A spokesman for Kleshna said that they also 'gift in kind' by devoting 20 per cent of their employees' time to the project.

An initial call to the Kleshna's company's customer hotline to inquire about the proportion of charity contributions was met with the declaration that Kleshna donates 25 per cent of profits from their poppy collection.

But company owner Kleshna Handel later rang MailOnline to clarify that the real figure was actually 10 per cent.

‘I’m very sorry that they gave you an inaccurate figure,' said the designer. 'But if you look on our website, you will see the correct one.’

'Gift in kind': Kleshna employees spend six months working on the poppy range and the jewellery is very popular - the £49.95 brooch, right, has already sold out

Should Kleshna be giving more than 10 per cent of poppy sales to the British Legion?

Any contribution at all is obviously very, very welcome.

But
 some buyers will be upset to learn that only a small proportion of the 
money they have spent on poppy jewellery - which is featured on the 
Royal British Legion  website - actually makes it to the Armed Forces.

Kleshna justifies the figures by saying: ‘It takes six months of the year for my company and my staff who work on this project.

‘We run a business but genuinely want to give money to charity.’

The company will not release figures on how much it has raised for the charity this year - or how much it shared last year.

Kleshna, who was moved to donate to 
charity because her family members and friends have died at war, simply 
said: ‘It’s a lot of money. We don’t choose to declare how much, because
 I don’t like boasting.

She added: 'I have been gifted with an ability to create things people want to buy, that is why I give to charity.

‘We work exceedingly hard for this, all for nothing.’

More generous? Eighty per cent of sales from this £25  Buckley brooch goes to the Royal British Legion

There is no doubt that Kleshna's poppies have helped raise awareness of this hardworking charity - especially among the young.

For their part, the charity, understandably, is very appreciative of any donation at all.

A spokesman from the British Legion said: 'The Kleshna line of poppy jewellery is produced under a licensing agreement with The Royal British Legion.

'In compliance with the Charity Act, this written agreement sets out terms agreeable to both parties under which Kleshna is entitled to the use of our logo in return for a donation to the Poppy Appeal.'

An insider added: 'We are very grateful for Kleshna's support.

'She does great things for us and has increased our profits exponentially.'

Both Kleshna and Buckley poppies can be bought via the Royal British Legion's website
