It began life as a venture above a pizza shop in the US, and is now the world's most visited travel website.

TripAdvisor is celebrating its 15th birthday today and with more than 200 million reviews and comments since the site went live in February 2000, it has certainly generated controversy.

From debate over the authenticity of reviews to arguments that it helps ensure high standards, TripAdvisor has become loved and hated in equal measure. 

TripAdvisor is celebrating its 15th birthday today after starting out above a pizza shop in the US

But the website has certainly showed no signs of slowing down as it gathers more and more reviews of restaurants, resorts, hotels and activities - allowing users to leave a rating in bubbles - one for the worst experience and five for the best.

So as the website turns 15, here are some bizarre facts you didn't know about TripAdvisor... 

1. A slice of history 

The company was founded in a small office above a pizza shop called Kosta’s in Needham, Massachusetts.

2. It wasn’t always about reviews

The site was originally designed as a B2B tool not a customer review site, but once the travel community started using it for that purpose the site quickly evolved to meet this need.

The Grand Canyon in Arizona did not impress everyone, receiving a number of one-star reviews including one which called it an 'overblown sandy ditch' and saying 'nature is c***' (see above)

3. A world full of bubbles 

The rating scores given by each reviewer are measured in ‘bubbles’ not stars.

4. The first of millions 

The first ever traveller review was of Captain's House Inn in Chatham, Massachusetts – which earned a rating of 4 bubbles.

5. A top contributor

TripAdvisor member BradJill from Hong Kong has posted the most reviews in the history of the site – more than 3,200 and counting.

TripAdvisor offers the chance to air you positive, or in this case, negative reviews; this one about Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer

Christ the Redeemer was called 'over-rated' and just a 'concrete pillar' in one-star reviews on TripAdvisor

6. Green means go 

Millions of consumers have seen the TripAdvisor ‘owl’ logo, but how many know why one eye is red and the other green? In fact, the two colours symbolise the way travellers choose where to go (green) and where not to go (red) on their next trip.

7. Sharing a great experience

The majority of reviews on TripAdvisor are positive – the average bubble rating is more than 4 out of 5.

London is the most reviewed city in the world, with tourists delighted to leave reviews of hotels, restaurants and attractions

8. The most reviewed city

The most reviewed city in the world is London – with over 1.8 million reviews of the city’s hotels, restaurants and attractions.

9. Looking for a bite to eat? 

Though for many the site is synonymous with hotels, there are actually more restaurants listed on TripAdvisor than hotels.

10. Every corner of the world covered

There are reviews on TripAdvisor for businesses in every country in the world – the most reviewed nation is the USA, the least reviewed is Tuvalu.

Tuvalu is the least reviewed nation in the country - but chances are if you visited it would all be positive

11. The growth of a global travel community

Though the site’s popularity originated in North America, the majority of TripAdvisor’s site traffic now comes from outside the US.

12. A decade on TripAdvisor

MariaAA is the longest registered member of the TripAdvisor community – having joined the site in 2002.

13. Plan, compare and book

TripAdvisor is not just about reviews – travellers can also compare price and availability for hotels and soon will be able to book their stay without leaving the site.

It's not difficult to see what the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas has the most 5 bubble reviews

14. 5 out of 5

Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas is the hotel with the most five bubble reviews - over 9,500 and counting

15. Wordsmiths

The total word count of all the reviews on TripAdvisor stands at more than 10 billion - nearly 12,000 times the number of words in the complete works of Shakespeare

Tourists called the Sphinx 'tiny' and surrounded by 'scum of the earth'. Visitors to the Pyramids said it was just camels and Brits in leggings
