Appalled: David Cameron on the findings of a report into the deaths of up to 1,200 people because of poor care in hospitals run by the Mid Staffordshire trust

Hundreds of hospital patients died in the biggest NHS scandal in living memory because of a box-ticking culture and a failure of compassion, a damning official report will say today.

David Cameron is appalled by the findings of a long-awaited report into the deaths of up to 1,200 people between 2005 and 2008 because of poor care in hospitals run by the Mid Staffordshire trust.

It is expected to blame managers who cut costs and reduced staffing levels in an attempt to hit Labour’s ‘efficiency’ targets and win foundation status.

The Prime Minister will respond to the findings by announcing the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals, who will be charged with ensuring hospitals deliver good, compassionate care rather than simply ‘chasing targets’.

Mr Cameron is expected to say: ‘We need a hospital inspection regime that doesn’t just look at numeric targets, but makes a judgment about the quality of care.’

The system will be modelled on that introduced in the early 1990s in education, where a chief inspector sends regular inspection squads into classrooms to assess all aspects of school life.

Ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals are ‘dotted around’ the NHS.

Mr Cameron, who has taken the unusual decision to make a statement on the report to MPs himself today, will offer ‘a strong expression of sorrow’ for the suffering of the families of patients let down by the hospitals.

Whitehall sources said the report would identify a culture of ‘metrics and league tables’ in the way hospitals are judged as a key factor in the scandal.

‘We need to look at patients as human beings, not numbers on a chart,’ said one. ‘We can’t tolerate a situation where hospitals are meeting all the targets, ticking all the boxes, and the reality is people are drinking water out of vases and sitting in their own excrement. 

‘You can’t legislate or mandate for compassion, but we must try to find a way to make sure the NHS is absolutely focused on making sure people get good quality care when they are in hospital – one of the most vulnerable times of their lives.’

Responsible for supervising: The report will make uncomfortable reading for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson

The report into the scandal, led by Robert Francis QC, was handed to Downing Street and the Department of Health yesterday. It is also expected to call for better training for nurses and healthcare assistants, and an overhaul of regulation to ensure poor managers are weeded out.

It will make uncomfortable reading for the Labour front bench and for the chief executive of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson. Between August 2005 and April 2006, he ran the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, which was responsible for supervising the hospitals.

His tenure came during a four-year period in which between 400 and 1,200 patients died needlessly due to a catalogue of failings and appalling standards of care. 

Sir David also helped appoint Martin Yeates as chief executive of Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust – which presided over the disaster – even though he had no managerial training.

Doctors in A&E at Stafford Hospital have since admitted that the whole department became ‘immune to the sound of pain’. Patients were shunted into corridors and neglected so they did not count towards a four-hour waiting-time target.

Sean Worth, a former adviser on health to the Prime Minister, claimed that the scandal at Mid Staffordshire was followed by ‘one of the biggest cover-ups in public service history’.

Mr Worth, who now works for the think-tank Policy Exchange, said a ‘Praetorian guard of NHS elites, trade unions and stuffy medical organisations’ were standing in the way of making the NHS more accountable to patients.

John Moore-Robinson: Misdiagnosed in hospital

The parents of one of the youngest victims of the Stafford scandal are calling for a new inquest because they believe staff covered up their mistakes.

John Moore-Robinson, 20, died in 2006 from major internal bleeding which was not picked up by doctors in Stafford Hospital’s A&E unit.

He had fallen off his mountain bike and ruptured his spleen. But he was diagnosed with a few fractured ribs and sent home in a wheelchair with a sick bucket. He died hours later at his home in Coalville, Leicestershire.

At an inquest in 2006, the coroner returned a narrative verdict meaning no one was blamed. But it has since emerged that the coroner did not see a vital report.

The report, by consultant Ivan Phair, concluded that the death was ‘avoidable’ and that there was a ‘high probability that the level of care delivered to Mr Moore-Robinson was negligent’. 

Mr Moore-Robinson’s parents, Janet and Frank, are seeking to overturn the verdict and want a new inquest.

Mr Moore-Robinson told BBC Newsnight: ‘Had John died as a result of the accident I could have accepted it as his injuries were so serious. But John needed care and the A&E department at Stafford was in meltdown.’

Lawyers representing the trust deny there was a cover-up.
