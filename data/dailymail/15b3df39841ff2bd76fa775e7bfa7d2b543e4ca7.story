A teenager who wants to sleep outside for a year has built a home made of snow for the winter. 

Rudy Hummel, 17, originally built a tree house in his back garden in Hermantown, Minnesota, during the summer.

But when temperatures dropped to 8 degrees Fahrenheit, Hummel piled up a mountain of snow, let it set before hollowing it out to live in.

The quinzhee was finished on December 10 and Hummel has been sleeping in it ever since. 

The teenager told the Duluth News Tribune: 'Originally, it was just going to be for the summer.

'I've always liked setting goals and making them, challenging myself.'

A string of blue Christmas lights hang across the roof and there is even a Christmas tree in the corner.

He sleeps in four sleeping bags topped with a quilt and a blanket. 

According to Hummel, he learned how to build the home as a Boy Scout in Duluth. 

His family originally lived in Alaska where he took part in camps and learnt his skills.

Despite sleeping outside, his parents Mark Hummel and Gail Johnejack are supportive of his outdoor pursuits. 

They describe themselves as a camping family and have many photos of a young Rudy holding books about rattlesnakes in his tent. 

But most of friends do not share the same interests. 

He said: 'They think I am crazy. They think it's pointless and stupid.' 

Hummel has now spent six months sleeping outside but wants to do a whole year.
