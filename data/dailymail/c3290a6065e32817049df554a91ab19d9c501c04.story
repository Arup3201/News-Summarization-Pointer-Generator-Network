Aside from a smattering of nervous laughter, the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel descended into silence on Sunday night  as Jodie Foster began a  speech that many Hollywood  observers have long believed she would never make.

On stage to accept a Cecil B. DeMille  lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, she announced she had a ‘sudden urge to say something that I’ve never really been able to air in public’.

In the rambling seven-minute speech that followed, Foster talked obliquely and sometimes even in the third person about a private life she has guarded fiercely for decades.

Some are still wondering what exactly the Oscar-winning star of The Accused and Silence Of The Lambs did admit, but the text of her speech left little room for doubt. For the first time in her career, Foster  publicly addressed her own sexuality.

Although she never mentioned the words ‘gay’ or ‘lesbian’, Foster appeared to end years of speculation about her private life.

As her two sons watched from the audience in a rare public appearance with their mother, Foster plunged in. She said she had to acknowledge Cydney Bernard, ‘one of the deepest loves of my life, my heroic co-parent, my ex-partner in love but righteous soul sister in life’.

As she said this, the woman in question sat with her head bowed with emotion a seat away from their two boys.‘Thank you, Cyd. I am so proud of our modern family. Our amazing sons, Charlie and Kit, who are my reason to breathe and to evolve, my blood and soul.’

As the showbusiness world digested the speech yesterday, it was clear from social media sites that scores of fans had been taken completely by surprise by the 50-year-old Foster’s coded revelations. Many simply wanted to know who Cydney Bernard was.

For years referred to simply as Foster’s ‘constant companion’ or ‘close friend’, Miss Bernard’s relationship with the actress has long been cloaked in uncertainty thanks to Foster’s intense privacy.

They met on the set of the 1993 Civil War film Sommersby — in which Foster starred with Richard Gere — and were reportedly quickly in a serious relationship together.

Miss Bernard — a film producer nearly ten years older who could pass for Foster’s dowdier sister — soon moved into the actress’s West Hollywood mansion.

In 1998, their relationship was cemented after they took shared parenting roles for the first of  Foster’s children, Charles, who was conceived by artificial insemination. Foster had her second son, Kit, in 2001 in the same circumstances.

The father of both boys is believed to have been a friend of Foster, a gay casting director named Randy Stone, who died of heart disease in 2007.

It is believed it was the lasting influence of Mr Stone, who campaigned for understanding for gay teenagers struggling with their sexuality, that convinced Foster she had to come out.

Mr Stone’s mother, the Reverend Beverly Bates, said this week that her son treated Jodie Foster’s two boys as if they were his own, but agreed to sign papers guaranteeing to keep secret the truth about their paternity. Foster, she added, plans to tell her boys their father’s identity when they turn 21.

In interviews, Foster has talked about her determination to give the boys a ‘normal’ family life, which she never had.

Thus it was that Miss Bernard legally adopted both children and shouldered many of the parenting duties, taking turns with Foster to drive them to school in their matching BMW convertibles.

The couple spent most of their time at home, indulging their shared passions for yoga and organic food.

Although Foster said she refused to have the usual household staff employed by Hollywood stars because she didn’t want a ‘bunch of strangers’ in the house, friends suggested she was simply terrified of her unconventional home life leaking out.

Foster’s secrecy would lead to bizarre scenes at film premieres, as Miss Bernard and the children waited quietly in the crowd for Foster’s red-carpet arrival before making their own way inside,  unnoticed by photographers.

For several years, the two women wore matching eternity rings on their wedding fingers, and in December 2007 Foster first publicly acknowledged the relationship, gushing at a private awards ceremony speech about ‘my beautiful Cydney, who sticks with me through the rotten and the bliss’.

Within five months, however, they had split. It emerged that Foster had found a new lover, screenwriter Cindy Mort, whom she had met two years earlier on the set of the film The Brave One.

The glamorous Miss Mort was 14 years younger than Foster, and famous for writing explicit sex scenes for America’s usually prudish TV sitcom world.

She couldn’t have been more different than the somewhat mumsy Miss Bernard, and she left the actress the following year, leaving Foster reportedly deeply upset.

Beverly Bates said the last she had heard, Foster had been dating a South American athlete, although it is clear that nobody has replaced Miss Bernard in Foster’s affections.

Indeed, despite speculation that Cydney could have laid claim to a portion of the actress’s $25 million fortune, the pair separated amicably, and Miss Bernard is now understood to live in one of Foster’s LA homes.

Though this week’s touching tribute has made plain Foster’s affection for Miss Bernard, their 15-year relationship was not Foster’s first experience of lesbianism.

She had an unsettled childhood after her father, a retired air force colonel, left her mother, film  producer Brandy Almond, shortly after Foster was conceived.

Her mother then moved in with a lesbian lover named Josephine Dominguez, whom Foster and her older three siblings called ‘Aunt Jo’.

From the age of three, when she appeared in a TV commercial for suncream, Foster was the household’s sole breadwinner.

A 1997, biography of the actress by her disaffected brother Buddy described a supremely dysfunctional showbusiness family.

Brandy was portrayed as hot tempered and sometimes violent, frittering away her children’s showbiz earnings.

As for his sister’s sexuality, Buddy claimed she’d had several boyfriends and had become ‘smitten’ with British actor Julian Sands after starring together in the 1987 erotic drama Siesta. But he had never doubted she was lesbian or bisexual, he said. A furious Foster cut her brother off for good.

It would be a psychiatrist’s job to say whether her father’s desertion of her mother coloured Foster’s view of men, but it is certainly true to say she has spent her career picking roles of strong women fighting against abusive men.

Foster became famous at 14 playing a child prostitute opposite Robert De Niro in the 1976 film Taxi Driver. She went on to win Oscars for her performances as a gang-raped waitress in The Accused and as an FBI agent on the trail of a serial killer in The Silence Of The Lambs.

What is particularly noticeable is that she hasn’t had a romantic lead since gazing into Richard Gere’s eyes in Sommersby 19 years ago — coincidentally, the film on which she met Cydney Bernard.

Perhaps she didn’t want to take on major roles when she was devoting so much time to raising her sons — or perhaps directors thought audiences might find Foster smooching with male leads faintly ridiculous given the rumours.

Even if she has had to watch as the glitzy roles have gone to less talented actresses, Foster has stolen the limelight back now.

She spoke forcefully at the Golden Globes about how actors had the right to privacy, which begs the question of why she bothered to step out of the closet now.

Was it simply because she is a  little mature for glamour roles and no longer needs to worry about her public image?

Certainly lesbianism can damage an actress’s career in America. Comedian Ellen DeGeneres said it took three years to resurrect her career and personal life after she came out in 1997.

For now, we must wait to see what effect, if any, the Golden Globes speech has on Foster’s career.

America’s gay community is divided; some admire her candour, others complain it took far too long for her to acknowledge the truth (gay activists tried to force her to admit her sexuality as long ago as the Eighties, when they plastered posters of her bearing the aggressive phrase ‘Absolutely Queer’ around American cities).

Still, nobody was left in any doubt that Foster’s speech, though carefully scripted, was from the heart.

‘I want to be seen, to be understood deeply and to be not so very lonely,’ she said with a smile.

Observers took it to be a reference to her song My Name Is Tallulah, in which — aged 13 — she crooned ‘You don’t have to be lonely’ to a room of smitten child gangsters in the 1976 film Bugsy Malone.

It was surely meant lightheartedly, but as an actress who has spent most of her career concealing her true self, it seemed strangely fitting.
