'Furious argument': Tilly Lamb was allegedly rowing with her husband before she fell to her death

Witnesses heard a ‘furious argument’ before a British mother of four plunged from a third-floor holiday apartment in a Moroccan resort, it emerged yesterday.

Tilly Lamb, 43, was seen lying fatally injured and semi-clothed on the ground before her husband Roger, 47, appeared briefly to check her pulse.

He then went back into the two-bedroom flat in Essaouira, on the west coast of the North African country, where their four sons aged nine to 16 were sleeping.

They were to be orphaned four days later when Mr Lamb fell to his own death from the second-floor balcony of a nearby luxury hotel.

The startling revelations emerged as police in Morocco were accused of trying to cover up the circumstances surrounding the deaths.

Despite a criminal inquiry being launched, the £30-a-night flat where the family were staying is still being rented to holidaymakers.

A Daily Mail reporter and photographer were yesterday shown around the spacious apartment in the town’s ancient Medina area, popular with bohemian tourists looking to taste North African culture.

An examination of the 3ft by 4ft window from which Mrs Lamb fell seemed to contradict police claims that she ‘stumbled and lost her footing’ in the early hours of August 17.

Not only would the bottom of the window have been at waist level when Mrs Lamb was standing on the floor, but a high wooden balustrade would have prevented her from falling.

There was no damage to any part of the window. The flat’s owner, Majid Naimi, said: ‘The only way out of the window is if someone climbs out or is pushed. There is no way it was just an accident.’

Mr Naimi, 24, rented the flat to Mrs Lamb for 900 dirhams, or around £70, for three days.

Recalling his first meeting with the family, he said: ‘Mrs Lamb appeared very relaxed and happy.

'She said she wanted to stay for three nights with her husband and sons. On the second night of their stay I got a phone call in the middle of the night saying there had been a terrible incident, with Mrs Lamb falling head first on to the street below.

‘There had been a furious argument 
heard by neighbours a few minutes beforehand. I spoke to Mr Lamb the 
next day and he was very calm and relaxed. The boys were in agony, 
however – they were crying and were very distressed.

Fatally injured: Tilly Lamb reportedly had a furious row at the flat she was holidaying in before she fell to her death

‘Mr Lamb went to the beach to swim. 
He and the boys completed their three-night stay, and then checked in at
the nearby Sofitel Hotel.’

Mrs Lamb died in hospital three days after her fall, and her husband plunged to his death the following day.

Jamal Dabi, 23, was near the flat at 12.30am on the night of the first tragedy when he heard ‘terrible screams’.

He told the Mail: ‘The English woman 
had been involved in an argument and dropped on to a ledge above a shop 
and rolled on to the ground. She had no clothes on except underwear.

‘A few minutes later the husband appeared to check her pulse. He quickly made his way back up to the flat.’

But last night Mrs Lamb’s 
brother-in-law said the couple’s sons denied there was any argument and 
insisted the holiday was ‘entirely amicable’.

Mark Rogerson said: ‘It was Ramadan 
so there was a great deal of noise around the building. Someone was 
banging on the door downstairs.

‘Tilly leaned over and told them to 
go away. There was an awning halfway down, so she had to lean quite a 
long way out to see over it.

‘As the police said, some wooden bar on the window broke and she fell.’

About the suggestion there had been 
an argument prior to her death, Mr Rogerson added: ‘These reports are 
utterly and totally untrue. They are also extremely hurtful to the 
family, particularly to the boys.

‘My source for information is one of the boys and they were there.’

Yesterday the couple’s four sons – 
Angus, 16, Monty, 15, Henry, 11, and Felix, nine – were staying at the 
Wiltshire home of their mother’s sister, Charlotte, and her husband 
Rupert Sebag Montefiore.

He is chairman of estate agent Savills and is related by marriage to socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.

Mr Lamb, a geo-technical engineer, 
had been living in New Zealand, where he was helping to rebuild the 
earthquake-hit city of Christchurch.

His family stayed at their £850,000 
home in the Worcestershire village of Pensham but they were understood 
to be preparing to join him.

An Essaouira police spokesman said the accident was still under investigation.
