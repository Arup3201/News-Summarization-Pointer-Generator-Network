A young mother has told of how she was forced to defend herself with a knife when a man tried to enter her home during a seven hour outage of 911 phone services in Washington State.

Alicia Cappola of Everett, Washington, was woken up by a man banging aggressively on her front door in the early hours of Thursday last week.

Worried about her two young twins asleep in the other room, she phoned 911, but despite trying 37 times she was unable to get thought to emergency services.

Attacked: Alicia Cappola of Everett, Washington, tried calling 911 more than 35 time, to alert police about the man trying to break into her home, but was forced to threaten the midnight intruder with a kitchen knife until he left

Ms Cappola kept trying 911, but explains that it continued to ring busy during the ten minutes the man was stood on her doorstep, attempting to get in.

She says she made 37 calls about the intruder breaking into her home, but in the end was forced to drive him away herself with a knife.

‘I thought I had done something wrong because 911 is never busy and you know, tried it a couple more times,’ she told Huffington Post.

‘He stopped banging on the door after about ten minutes and ripped a screen off a window on my front porch and unfortunately the window was unlocked.

‘Then he came through the window I grabbed a knife in my kitchen and went toward him and told him to get out.’

The man, who according to Ms Cappola appeared to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, left after she was able to convince him that this was not his home.

She was later able to get through to 911 services and police arrived around 3am – over an hour after the man began his attempt to get through her door.

CenturyLink says the seven-hour outage in Washington state 911 service early Thursday was caused by a technical error by a third-party vendor.

In a statement Friday, the company said the vendor worked with CenturyLink to resolve the issue ‘as quickly as possible.’

The company said a similar, shorter 911 outage about the same time in Oregon affected about 16,000 phone customers in Lincoln, Tillamook and Yamhill counties.

CenturyLink says that was caused by a maintenance issue.
