As a dictator, Kim Jong-un requires his devoted supporters to show a number of loyal attributes.

One is stringent military discipline by men, while the another is undivided affection by his female followers.

The reclusive dictator has managed to show off both those traits in his most recent photo call.

Mobbed: A group of feral women then crowd round him, grabbing his arm, screaming and giving the dictator their undivided attention

Round of applause: He walks away from his front-and-centre position with a smile on his face with a crowd of women clapping behind him

The first image shows the reclusive 
dictator lined up in an official photo with members of the 'chairperson'
 from the Korean People's Army.

The group of soldiers sit stoney-faced, starting at the camera, in a show of military discipline.

When the photo is over, he walks away from his central position to a standing ovation.

But then, the leader is quickly mobbed by a crowd of frantic females.

Screaming their heads off, they gather around their dear leader, grabbing onto his arm.

Despite the mobbing, the Korean leader smiles as he takes in their undivided attention.

Earlier this month he was 
're-elected' as leader of North Korea having executed his 
politically-powerful uncle last year and successfully disposed of 11 
high-ranking government officials over the weekend.
