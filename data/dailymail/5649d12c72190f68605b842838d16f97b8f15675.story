For Steve Clarke, there were no apologies, no guilt and no sense of remorse. He deemed the nine changes before their defeat at Watford necessary if Reading are to be ready for Bradford in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Monday night.  

Of those nine, four were making full debuts. Discounting Simon Cox, the rest of the Royals side had made just 34 Championship starts between them this season. Whatever Clarke says, this was an unwrapped gift to a team chasing promotion to the Premier League.

But the manager must be well down the list when blame is apportioned.

Steve Clarke played a decidedly under strength side at Vicarage Road that will completely change on Monday

It is the fault of broadcasters that he had just 48 hours between leaving Vicarage Road on Saturday and kicking off against Phil Parkinson’s Bradford on Monday evening. Domestic cup fixtures cannot be played on the same night as Champions League games and, as such, there is no way around this ludicrous situation.

Clarke is expected to name a completely fresh XI at the Madejski Stadium, while Parkinson, who made six changes of his own side for the 1-1 draw at Notts County, will mix and match, too.

Bradford had five players who retained their place from the Cup game. Reading had none. Fifteen changes was the sum total and for one reason only.

Clarke is dealing with a ludicrous 48-hour turnaround between playing Watford and Bradford

These will be two teams going hell for leather in a competition they have prioritised. Their tedious goalless draw at Valley Parade last week may have been wretched to watch, but this tie is harking back to the FA Cup’s old days, neither side giving an inch. They could not bear losing at this stage.

Reading supporters won’t remember the 4-1 defeat at Watford in a decade’s time, but a day out at Wembley, taking on holders Arsenal, would stick in the memory should they progress.

The Royals have nothing to play for in the league. They are safe and will not trouble the second tier’s play-offs.

And club captain Jem Karacan, who made only his second appearance for the club since September 2013 because of injury, backed his manager’s decision to ring the changes.

‘The gaffer has to bear the replay in mind,’ said Karacan, who scored his side’s consolation as Watford ran riot with strikes from Almen Abdi, Matej Vydra, Troy Deeney and Fernando Forestieri. ‘If you put a team out that doesn’t win at Watford you get criticised, but if you don’t win on Monday you get criticised as well so it’s a catch-22 for the gaffer.

‘Playing at Wembley is one of those things that you just can’t describe. The feeling we had when we went there before (the 2011 Championship play-off final loss to Swansea) will always stay with me.’

Parkinson has had a trickier balancing act. Bradford are three points beneath the League One play-offs and will have two games in hand once Tuesday’s programme of fixtures is complete. 

He couldn’t afford to make changes quite so wholesale for their trip to Nottingham, knowing promotion is by no means out of the question.

Those in West Yorkshire will think of two years ago when they were capable of juggling that fairytale journey to the Capital One Cup final and the league campaign, which ended in promotion from League Two. Reading will doubtless have the fresher side tonight and Parkinson knows his team blew their best chance of reaching the semi-finals. But they feed off adrenaline. Just ask Chelsea and Sunderland.

Two games in three days will not faze this collection of loanees and cast-offs. After all, Arsenal await.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND

Maybe, just maybe, Ronnie Moore can inspire Hartlepool to Football League survival. Marooned at the foot of League Two for months, all looked lost.

The 1-0 win at Morecambe - thanks to an Andy Parrish own goal - was their first three points on the road since October, their first clean sheet away from Victoria Park for 12 months and puts them within two results of safety. 

No wonder defender Scott Harrison was close to tears in the dressing room afterwards.

Steve Clarke's starting side will be entirely different on Monday night

Reading have just 48 hours between leaving Watford and kicking off against League One's Bradford for a place in the FA Cup semi-finals

Malky Mackay was on the brink of being given the boot by Wigan four weeks ago. Remarkably the Latics then went on a four-match winning run away from home, including Saturday’s 2-1 win at relegation rivals Rotherham, to give themselves hope in the Championship.

It might finally be time for Preston to return to the Championship. They walloped Crewe 5-1 at Deepdale — Joe Garner netting four — to retain their two-point lead over Swindon in the race for second in League One.

Carlisle had the chance to become the first team in almost half a century to go 30 games without drawing. Manager Keith Curle said it was ‘all or nothing’ for his team. That was before they drew 0-0 at York.
