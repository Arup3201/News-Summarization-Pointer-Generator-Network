Tragic: Anthony Shadid, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Iraq, died today in eastern Syria

A New York Times reporter has died from an asthma attack as he attempted to leave Syria on horseback.

Pulitzer-Prize winner Anthony Shadid had been in eastern Syria reporting on the uprising against President Bashar Assad when he suffered the attack as he left the country.

Times photographer Tyler Hicks was with him at the time and said he had suffered another attack a week ago as they entered the country, again on horseback.

Mr Hicks carried his colleague's body over the border into Turkey. Both men were in the country without the permission of the Syrian government.

He told the New York Times: 'I stood next to him and asked if he was ok, and then he collapsed.'

He added that Mr Shadid was unconscious and his breathing was shallow and a few minutes later he stopped breathing. He was apparently allergic to horses.

Mr Shadid had been reporting in Syria for a week, gathering information on the resistance to the Syrian government.

New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson sent a note to the newsroom this evening, relaying the news of Shadid's death and remembering him.

She wrote: 'Anthony died as he lived - determined to bear witness to the transformation sweeping the Middle East and to testify to the suffering of people caught between government oppression and opposition forces'.

Mr Shadid, long known for covering wars and other conflicts in the Middle East, was among four reporters detained by Libyan forces loyal to Moammar Gaddafi last March.

The Libyan government released Mr Shadid, Mr Hicks, Stephen Farrell and Lynsey Addario after several days in captivity.

Speaking to an audience in Oklahoma City about a month after his release, he said he had a conversation with his father the night before he was detained.

'Maybe a little bit arrogantly, perhaps with a little bit of conceit, I said, "It's OK, Dad. I know what I'm doing. I've been in this situation before," Shadid told the crowd of several dozen people.

'I guess on some level I felt that if I wasn't there to tell the story, the story wouldn't be told.'Â

Shadid's father, Buddy Shadid, who lives in Oklahoma City, said a colleague tried to revive his son but couldn't.

'They were in an isolated place. There was no doctor around,' Buddy Shadid said. 'It took a couple of hours to get him to a hospital in Turkey.'

He said Anthony Shadid had asthma all his life and had medication with him.

'[But] he was walking to the border because it was too dangerous to ride in the car,' the father said.

'He was walking behind some horses - he's more allergic to those than anything else - and he had an asthma attack.'

The 43-year-old American of Lebanese descent won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 2004 and 2010 for his coverage in Iraq.

He was married to fellow Times reporter Nada Bakri, with whom he had a son.

Mr Shadid had previously worked for Associated Press, the Boston Globe and the Washington Post.
