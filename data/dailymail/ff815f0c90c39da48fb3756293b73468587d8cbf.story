Researchers have unveiled the nearest thing yet to a real-life transformer - a human sized robot that can walk, climb walls and even turn into a tank to move across tough terrain.

The Carnegie Mellon University Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform, or
CHIMP, is designed to primarily move like a tank using tracks to cover 
tough terrain.

However, when it needs to, it can simply stand up - and even use 
built in 'claws' to climbs ladders, scale buildings and even hold a 
car's steering wheel.

The latest entrant to DARPA's $2m Robotics Challenge is a four-limbed robot with near-human strength and the dexterity to climb ladders or use tools

Like a chimpanzee, each extremity is equipped with a manipulator that enables it to grasp objects

Its developer say it can:

Move across tough terrain like a tank

Stand up to access higher objects

Climb walls using 'claws'

Climbs ladders

Use claws to operate power tools

Open valves and control steering wheels

Its normal mode of locomotion will be much like that of a tank, with the tracks of all four limbs on the ground, the team says.

This configuration would offer a particular advantage when moving over debris and rough terrain.

But CHIMP also can move on the treads
of just two limbs when needed, such as when it must use one or more 
limbs to open a valve, or to operate power tools.

CHIMP will be able to perform complex, physically challenging tasks through supervised autonomy.

A remote, human operator will make 
high-level commands controlling the robot’s path and actions, while the 
robot’s on-board intelligence prevents collisions, maintains stability 
and otherwise keeps the robot from harm.

The robot also will be pre-programmed
to execute tasks such as grasping a tool, stepping on a ladder rung or 
turning a steering wheel without step-by-step direction from the human 
controller, circumventing the lag between command and execution.

'Humans provide high-level control, 
while the robot provides low-level reflexes and self-protective 
behaviors,' said Tony Stentz, NREC director and Tartan Rescue Team 
leader.

'This enables CHIMP to be highly capable without the complexity associated with a fully autonomous robot.

The CMU Highly Intelligent Mobile Platform (CHIMP) from Carnegie Mellon University uses mounted tracks on each triple-jointed limb to move like a tank over roads

As well as tracks, the Chimp robot has triple-fingered manipulators to climb up ladders, remove debris, or even turn a steering wheel

'This type of robot has tremendous potential,' he said.

The robot will compete in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, in which robots will have human-like capabilities to respond to calamities such as the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.

Climbing ladders and driving vehicles are among the obstacles robots will face in environments engineered for people.

The NREC entry, Tartan Rescue Team, is one of seven selected by DARPA for DRC Track A, in which each team will develop its own hardware and software. 

CHIMP is designed with static stability; it won’t fall down even if it experiences a computer glitch or power failure.

'When we walk or stand, our brains are actively controlling our balance all of the time,' Stentz said.

'This dynamic balance makes people nimble and enables them to run.'

When necessary, however, the operator can control CHIMP’s individual joints, enabling it to adapt its motion to particular circumstances or extricate itself from tight spots.

'In a pinch, it can do anything,' Stentz said.

The robot can move like a tank over roads and rough ground, but can rise up onto two tracks to use the triple-fingered manipulators to climb up ladders, remove debris, or even turn a steering wheel
