David Blunkett is to quit Parliament after 28 years, he announced today

David Blunkett last night announced he is quitting  Parliament at the next election after 28 years as an MP.

The former Labour cabinet minister, 67, revealed he is stepping down at a meeting with party members in his constituency.

Describing it as ‘by far the most difficult political decision I have ever made’, he said: ‘I owe so much to so many people who have made it possible for me to play a significant part in public life.’

The married father of four said it was a privilege to spend ‘eight years in the Cabinet of a Labour Government’.

But in what may be seen as a swipe at Ed Miliband, he said the party leadership ‘wish to see new faces in ministerial office’.

The MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough added: ‘I would rather leave while I am still giving 100 per cent.’

Last night, Mr Miliband paid tribute to Mr Blunkett, saying he was ‘a man whose commitment and determination have carried him to the highest positions in politics with one purpose: to serve the people of our country’.

Mr Blunkett, who entered politics aged 22, was Britain’s first blind Cabinet minister, serving  in roles including Education Secretary under Tony Blair.

His achievements included tough policies to ensure  basic standards of literacy  and numeracy.

He had been tipped as a future prime minister but was forced to resign in 2004 over allegations he helped fast-track a tourist visa for his ex-lover Kimberly Quinn’s nanny – which he denied.

Mr Blunkett was brought back to the Cabinet after the 2005 general election.

But he was forced to resign a second time in November that year after claims of a ‘conflict of interest’ created by his being a director in a firm proposing to bid for government contracts.

He was later found not to have broken the ministerial code.

Announcing his departure in front of constituency members, Mr Blunkett said: ¿I owe so much to so many people who have made it possible for me to play a significant part in public life¿
