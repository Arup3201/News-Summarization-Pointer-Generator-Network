It's the Scottish retreat beloved of Queen Victoria - and subsequent generations of royal holidaymakers, the Queen and the Duke of Cambridge among them, love it just as much.

Now, as the Queen arrives at the Aberdeenshire castle to begin her annual summer break, vintage photos reveal just how happy her memories of summers spent there really are.

From her earliest visits as a tiny child with her parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to 1950s family picnics with the corgis in tow, Balmoral has long been a haven where family pleasures come first.

Among the charming photos drawn from the Daily Mail archives are lovely shots of the Queen tacking up Princess Anne's first pony and another which shows the Duke of Edinburgh demonstrating his barbecuing skills.

Another shows Peter Phillips making one of his first visits to the castle, running off with his mother jogging behind and in another charming picture, tumbling over as the rest of the family line up for a group shot.

William and Harry also feature in the photos, both as tiny babies and later as young men. One adorable series of photos shows the two-year-old Duke of Cambridge attempting to scramble up the steps into a plane following a Balmoral break, while others show them with their mother, Princess Diana.

The Prince of Wales, or the Duke of Rothesay as he is known in Scotland, also features in many of the photos, toddling around the grounds as a small child and laughing with his brother Prince Andrew as a teenager.

Charles, who usually uses Birkhall, another property on the estate, for his summer visits, is also seen strolling arm in arm with the Duchess of Cornwall, who is also pictured going for a rainy walk with her dogs.

But it's not all fun and games for the royals at Balmoral. The Queen has a long tradition of hosting visiting statesmen and the Prime Minister for parts of her stay at Balmoral with Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, and US president Dwight. D. Eisenhower among those to have visited.

Balmoral, which is privately owned by the Queen, was purchased by Queen Victoria in 1852, although the castle's royal connections are of a considerably older vintage.

First mentioned in the 12th century, Balmoral began life as a hunting lodge owned by Robert II of Scotland but had been handed to the Drummond family who built the first castle on the site in 1390.

Edward aged 15 enjoy a family holiday at Balmoral in 1979

Later, the castle became the property of the Earls of Huntly before passing into the Farquharson family. The Farquharsons, committed Jacobites, were involved in both uprisings as well as the Battle of Falkirk in 1746 during which James Farquharson, the then owner, was wounded.

With the Jacobites defeated, the estate was declared forfeit and was handed to another branch of the family, the Farquharsons of Auchendryne, who in 1798, sold it to James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife.

He, in turn, leased it to Sir Robert Gordon, a younger brother of the Earl of Aberdeen, who lived there from 1830 until his death in 1847. It was then that Queen Victoria, already in love with the rolling Scottish moors, stepped in to buy the property, eventually rebuilding the house and clearing the way for generations of royal holidaymakers.
