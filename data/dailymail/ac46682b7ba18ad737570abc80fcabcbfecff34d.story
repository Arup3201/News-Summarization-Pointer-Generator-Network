Ex-serviceman Bill Ramsay, 82, has been left outraged after learning an off-duty fireman who attacked him in his home in Farsley, Leeds, will not face charges

An off-duty fireman who attacked an 82-year-old veteran in his own home will not face charges after police decided an apology was enough.

Cancer-stricken ex-serviceman Bill Ramsay was beaten by Adam Talbot during a row in the hallway of his eighth floor flat in Farsley, Leeds, last Friday.

Talbot was arrested and admitted assault for the attack - but was later released with a fine and told to write a letter of apology.

The police decided not to hand the case to prosecutors and it was instead dealt with using new laws known as an Out of Court Disposal.

But Mr Ramsay - who has an inoperable cancerous tumour in his injured eye - is outraged at the move and has demanded Talbot be prosecuted.

Retired Mr Ramsay, who served with 1st Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment in the 1950s, said: 'That law is fine if somebody nicks an apple from a shop - but this is a serious crime.

'The most terrifying thing was being hit in my eye where I have a cancerous tumour, that can't be operated on because I would have to go into too deep a sleep.

'I'm not far away from it being curtains. It's disgusting that Talbot is going to get away with attacking me in my own home.'

Police said a suspended prosecution under the new government measures which replaces police cautions. 

Talbot was handed conditions with his punishment which were to pay £150 compensation and a fine of £50.

He was also told to write a letter of apology to Mr Ramsay and banned from entering his street.

If he does not comply with the conditions, Talbot will be hauled before a court.

Mr Ramsay, who has 16 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, spent 28 years being a Santa Claus for sick children at schools and hospitals in Leeds.

Mr Ramsay, who is a longtime friend of Emmerdale actor Chris Chittell, said he was verbally abused before Talbot forced his way inside and hit him causing a cut and a black eye.

West Yorkshire Police said the appropriate action was taken because Talbot had no previous convictions, he admitted his guilt and expressed remorse.

Detective Chief Inspector Lisa Atkinson, Head of Leeds District Reactive CID, said: 'A suspended prosecution was the most appropriate disposal for this offence of Section 39 Common Assault due to the offender having no previous convictions, fully admitting the offence and showing genuine remorse for his actions.

Veteran Mr Ramsay suffered a small cut and black eye in the attack. The 82-year-old has an inoperable cancerous tumour in his injured eye

'Prior to that decision being made the victim was consulted and, at that time, was satisfied with that outcome.

'Under the current two-tier out of court disposals pilot project a suspended prosecution is the stronger of two options - the lower being a statutory community resolution.

'The suspended prosecution means that if the offender fails to fulfil the conditions imposed they will face action at court.

'The conditions applied in this case included writing a letter of apology to the victim by December 31, paying £150 compensation and a fine of £50, plus a ban from entering the victim's street.

'Had the matter been progressed to court it is unlikely the offender would have received any greater penalty and possible he could have received a lesser sanction.

'The victim was spoken to again and raised concerns about the amount of time the offender had been given to write the letter of apology.

'The letter has since been submitted to the investigating officer and forwarded to the victim.

Mr Ramserved  pictured during his army days with the 1st Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, said he was 'disguested' that Talbot had got away with it

'The victim's son contacted officers to raise concerns and the reasoning has been explained to him.

'The victim was spoken to again by the investigating officer and had changed his mind and was no longer satisfied with the use of a suspended prosecution.

'While the process does take account of the views of victims, police officers will use their professional judgement to assess the circumstances and decide on the most appropriate outcome.'

A West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: 'We are investigating an incident that occurred on Friday evening involving an off-duty firefighter.

'We are not able to comment on on-going investigations.'
