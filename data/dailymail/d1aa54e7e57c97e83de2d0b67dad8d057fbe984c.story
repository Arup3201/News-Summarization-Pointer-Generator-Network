Passengers flying from Heathrow and Gatwick face being forced to pay a 'congestion charge' which would double the amount they would pay in tax compared to at other British Airports.

In a bid to address Britain's air capacity crisis, the Government is exploring whether increasing passenger duty could ease congestion at the country's two busiest airports, which are both set to reach full capacity in six years.

In a study by HM Revenue and Customs, it was found the number of passengers flying from Heathrow would fall from 23.1million a year to 18.9million if a premium rate of tax was added to fares.

Full to bursting: Heathrow Airport is set to reach full capacity in 2019, prompting the Government to explore ways of easing congestion. One solution suggested is to significantly increase passenger taxes

If the plans went ahead, the tax on an economy flight to New York would rise to £32.50.

A similar charge at Gatwick would see passenger departures fall from 15.1million to 12.8million in 2014, with the knock-on effect that more passengers would use Luton, Birmingham and Stansted.

While Birmingham backs the idea, Heathrow warned it would damage Britain's trade, with carriers choosing to switch to other European hubs.

A BAA spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'Long haul flights forced out of Heathrow by the higher taxes would not go to other UK airports - they would go to our European competitors in Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam.

'The economic growth and trade deals that come with these flights would then benefit Europe, not the UK.'

A spokesman for the CBI, the business lobbying organisation, said the answer was to increase capacity, rather than force airlines and passengers away.

'We're already losing business to other European destinations so we can't kick this into the long grass,' he told the paper.

'We need new connections with fast-growing markets like India, China and South America - with space for airlines to put on new flights.

Stansted is thought of as the existing London airport most likely to be expanded to ease Britain's aviation capacity crisis

The Treasury said it asked HMRC to examine the impact of the charge, but insisted it was simply a 'research project to inform policy-making in general'.

According to latest government projections, Gatwick will reach bursting point in 2019, while City Airport in east London will be full in 2021.

The only space for expansion in London appears to be at Stansted, which will fill up in 2028, a year ahead of Luton.

A ban - signed off in 1979 -  on expansion at Gatwick expires in 2019 and the airport's owners are considering applying for a second runway to be built after that, which would double capacity to 70million passengers a year.

A commission will present its thoughts on how London can deal with its capacity issues later this year.

It will explore the feasibility of the so-called Boris Island airport in the Thames Estuary, which is the preferred option of London Mayor Boris Johnson, or whether the Government should reverse its policy on expansion of London's existing airports.
