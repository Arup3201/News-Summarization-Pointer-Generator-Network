A 41-year-old woman who began dieting at the age of 10 has spoken out to praise the Weight Watchers healthy eating plan after it helped her to lose 150lbs in two years. 

Danyeil Durrant, a paralegal from Sebastian, Florida, struggled with her eating habits from an early age, but admits that it wasn't until a doctor warned her of the devastating impact her weight could have on her health that she realized she needed to take drastic action. 

'[Doctors told me] that I was going to have a heart attack within 10 years if I didn't change my ways,' the 41-year-old told CNN.

'I spent 30 years of my life thinking that if I could just lose this weight, then my life could begin, then I'd make the cheerleading squad, then I could take that vacation, then I would meet the man of my dreams, etc.

'I never felt like I was enough.'

In August 2012, after years of yo-yo dieting, Dani's weight had ballooned to 363lbs and it was then that she discovered Weight Watchers - after hearing what success her sister had found while following the company's unique points system. 

For the first time in three decades, Dani discovered how to create a healthy and balanced meal and she admits that she was surprised to discover that following such an effective weight-loss plan didn't mean giving up all of her favorite foods for good. 

'In the past, if I ate what I considered non-diet food, I thought I had ruined everything, and I would quit whatever diet I was on,' she said.

'Now I know that I can still occasionally splurge, attend celebrations, go to restaurants… because I have learned how to choose something healthy anywhere I go.'

In the past two years, Dani has managed to drop almost half of her body weight and is now a healthy size 12. But her weight loss journey hasn't stopped and she is currently working towards losing a further 73lbs in order to reach her final goal weight, '150lbs of muscle'.

In addition to her healthy eating plan, the fitness fan now trains at her local gym every single day, working the training regime around her day-to-day life. 

'Even if I'm out of town I make sure to go before I leave or I rush back to get in my workout before midnight,' she says. 'I feel unstoppable.'

Healthy and happy: Although she is still continuing with her healthy eating and fitness plans, Dani admits she is much happier with every aspect of her life

In the hopes of inspiring other women to achieve the same success that she has - and to ensure she remains motivated - Dani created a Facebook page called Get Down with Dani which she uses to document her ongoing diet and fitness routine.

The page has since amassed more than 20,000 followers, many of whom have hailed Dani has an 'inspiration' thanks to her healthy outlook on weight loss.

'What makes you beautiful is not that you have lost weight,' Heather Reisig wrote. 'What makes you beautiful is that you want to help others do something that takes a lot of dedication and time.'

Pam Hall Smith added: 'Searching for inspiration...I believe I truly have found it! Thanks for sharing your story...'
