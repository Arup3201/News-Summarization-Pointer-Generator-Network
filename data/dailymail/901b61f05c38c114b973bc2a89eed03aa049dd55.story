A survival guide for summer interns at Goldman Sachs has been posted to a blog which advises them to tell racist jokes and brag about sleeping with colleagues.

The advice, written by the creators of revealing Twitter account Goldman Sachs Elevator Gossip, warns the interns taking up their position that 'the race hasn't even started yet'.

The writer then includes a list of 20 tips to help them get a full-time position at the firm including: 'Don't brag about being a decent golfer. This should be a given.'

Survival of the fittest: A blog offers advice for Goldman Sachs summer interns - including how to sabotage fellow interns, how to master the dress code, and how to remain in a boss's favor

The writer also talks about the 'war' you automatically engage in with fellow interns.

He
suggests coming up with a 'dismissive nickname' for a fellow intern - 
like Chico, Bud Fox, Fredo or Bubba - and 'hope that it catches on.'

The list also suggests ways to remain in a boss's favor. 'If
your boss smokes, smoke,' it advises.

But it adds that you shouldn't 
buy a round of drinks if you're out with seniors, since 'you can't 
afford them, and it won't score any points.'

Asking
the secretary for your seniors' travel schedules helps you appear 
proactive, and it also lets you know 'when you can sleep in, hit the gym, 
or beat the traffic to South Hampton.'

But the writer insists you must balance subservience with assertiveness.

Tidbit: The advice is written by the creator of revealing Twitter account GS Elevator, which exposed outrageous conversations overheard in the banking firm's elevator

'Don't be too good to do the coffee runs. It shows confidence,' he advises, before adding: 'Just don't f*** it up. If you can't be trusted with coffee, how can you sell bonds or manage risk.'

Other tips tell interns how to sabotage a
fellow intern - by changing his screen to porsche.com or 
morganstanley.com while he is away from his desk, for instance.

And in terms of dress code, the advice is strict: 'Buy a decent suit,' it says.

'But no cuffed or pleated pants. And don't wear a tie unless you might have a meeting. No one likes that kind of kiss-ass.'

'Don't brag about being a decent golfer. This should be a given'

The
rules on neckties are equally specific. 'Learn how to tie a double 
Windsor,' the list states. 'Just make sure the knot's not too fat.'

Several of the rules are followed by
the phrase 'you have to earn it,' pointing to the hierarchical system 
in the finance world.

'Don't wear Hermes ties, ever,' stipulates rule number three. 'You have to earn it.'

Rule six states: 'Keep your shoes shiny, but don't let anyone see you having your shoes shined. You have to earn it.'

And the blog offers unconventional advice on how to find a mentor. 'If you went to a decent boarding school, subtly find out if anyone who matters went to the same school,' it says.

'Boom, he's your rabbi. At this point, no one cares about college credentials; it's a given.'

And if your stint as a Goldman Sachs intern doesn't turn into a permanent position, do not fear, says the blog.

'There are plenty of Vineyard Vines wearing, New Canaan commuting,Â  Morgan Stanley name-dropping "rainmakers" waiting to pick you up and dust you off,' it says.

'Not making the cut at Goldman is like being traded by the Yankees. You'll still probably make millions, but it's just not the same.'
