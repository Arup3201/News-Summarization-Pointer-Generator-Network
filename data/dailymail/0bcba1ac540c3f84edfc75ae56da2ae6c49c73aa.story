'Esteemed journalist': The body of Dominic Di-Natale, 43, who traveled around the world with Foz News, was discovered on Wednesday

A veteran Fox News correspondent has been found dead in his Colorado apartment following an apparent suicide.

The body of journalist Dominic Di-Natale, 43, who traveled around the world with the broadcaster, was discovered on Wednesday.

Officials in Jefferson County were alerted by a friend of the reporter who was aware of his state of mind, relating to serious undisclosed health issues, according to the station. 

They confirmed that he had taken his own life. 

His career took him all over the globe covering top stories. He visited Osama bin Laden's compound after the terror leader's death and was in Egypt's Tarhir Square during the uprising against President Mubarak in 2011.

Mr Di-Natale started working for Fox in 2007, covering world news, economics and business on a variety of platforms.

A spokesman for the station said: 'We were extremely saddened to learn of Dominic’s passing and send our deepest condolences to his family and friends.

'He was an esteemed journalist and an integral part of our news coverage throughout the Middle East.' 

Fox anchor Megyn Kelly wrote on Twitter: 'So sad to hear Fox's Dominic Di-Natale has died. A great reporter, who off-air was always trying to help US troops. I will miss him.' 

Jessie Jane Duff, a former US Marine gunnery sergeant posted: 'Dominic Di-Natale loved the military & never walked away from a tough story, died at 43. Rest in peace.'

Mike Emmanuel, who has been with the channel since 1997, said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news.

Mr Di-Natale, who was born in Britain, began his career in 1989 as a magazine writer in Portugal, where he covered the European drug trade.

He moved to the UK in 1995, where he did freelance work for several national newspapers before taking a position as correspondent for BBC World. He spent time working in Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, London and New York. 

After joining Fox in 2007, he studied Arabic at Damascus University the following year - when the country was still safe - and went on to work in Baghdad, at the time one of the most dangerous assignments for a Western journalist. 

Following the death of bin Laden in May 2011, Mr Di-Natale chiseled a brick from the foundations of the terrorist leader's compound and donated it to the 9/11 museum in New York.
