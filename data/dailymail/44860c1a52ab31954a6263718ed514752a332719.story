It's that time of year again when the leaves begin to fall and the nights are drawing in. 

But one dog called Butch likes to make the most of the autumnal weather. 

His owner Kent Petersen, from Utah, had just finished raking the leaves in his back garden when the Siberian husky decided he wanted to have some fun.

WATCH BUTCH PLAYING IN THE LEAVES 

Footage shows the loveable dog gleefully burying himself in the leaf pile before dancing, jumping and prancing around.

One YouTube user wrote: 'Two weeks to gather them into a pile. Ten minutes to obliterate.'

According to Mr Petersen, Butch is only too happy to help him rake up the leaves in his back yard.

The original video was posted 10 months ago but this week Mr Petersen uploaded another video of his beloved dog yet again helping him in the garden.

@ZaZa Doggy ---------- Does everything on the planet make your BLOOD BOIL and make you LIVID? Just reading your comments makes me think you are unbalanced in a way (or ways). As we like to say in Texas "Bless your heart"

Yep, as Winnie the Pooh said, "... but the best thing about this time of year... jumping into leaves!  "  LOL!

Seriously adorable. How nice it would be to be so happy-go-lucky! Also, really jealous of that backyard. My dogs would be so happy there..

This looks very dangerous and even somewhat cruel. Doesn't America have an RSPCA? Watching this makes me absolutely LIVID! I have already had a fierce rown with someone about it this morning!

- ZaZa Doggy, Bishops Stortford,++++++I am amazed and totally puzzled by your comment. Please, please explain how a dog having fun in a pile of leaves is dangerous and CRUEL??

Lucky dog to have a garden like that, I don't even have a balcony. If he keeps having this fun the  leaves will be reduced to half the size ,so less to bag ,brilliant ha ha
