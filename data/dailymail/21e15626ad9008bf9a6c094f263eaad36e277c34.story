They are some of the world’s most-loved animals, but almost 95 per cent of lemurs are threatened with extinction, according to the latest global assessment of at-risk species.

The Brazilian three-banded armadillo, which is the mascot for this year’s World Cup, remains vulnerable to extinction, and is joined by a host of other creatures whose future looks equally bleak.

Almost four-fifths of slipper orchids, which are found in North America, Europe and temperate regions of Asia, are also at risk of dying out, while the Japanese eel - a traditional delicacy and Japan’s most expensive food fish - is endangered.

A total of 22,103 species are listed as being either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

The latest update shows that 94 per cent of lemur species in Madagascar are threatened with extinction.

More than a fifth are critically endangered, inlcuding the largest living lemur, the Indri.

Almost half of the species are endangered, including the world’s smallest primate, Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur, and 20 are vulnerable to extinction.

Lemurs are threatened by destruction of tropical forest habitat, with illegal logging on the increase in the face of political uncertainty and rising poverty in Madagascar, where some people hunt them for food.

More than 73,000 species were assessed by conservationists for the IUCN Red List, which is marking its 50th anniversary this year.

The animals and plants are among the 22,103 species assessed by experts as being in the three 'at-risk' categories of critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

The latest update shows that 94 per cent of lemur species in Madagascar - the only place they are found - are threatened with extinction, making them one of the most threatened groups of animals on Earth.

Of the African island nation’s 101 remaining lemur species, more than a fifth are critically endangered, including the largest living lemur, the large-bodied Indri.

Almost half of the species are endangered, including the world’s smallest primate, Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur and 20 are vulnerable to extinction.

Lemurs are threatened by destruction of tropical forest habitat, with illegal logging on the increase in the face of political uncertainty and rising poverty in Madagascar, where some people hunt them for food.

‘Despite profound threats to lemurs, which have been exacerbated by the political crisis in Madagascar, we believe there is still hope,’ said Dr Chistoph Schwitzer, on the IUCN’s primate specialist group who is also Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society.

‘Past successes demonstrate that collaboration between local communities, non-governmental organisations and researchers can protect imperilled primate species,’ he said.

Dr Thomas Lacher of Texas A&M University explained that the high threat level to lemurs required significant action as the animals play a critical role in the threatened ecosystems in Madagascar.

‘They also represent an important source of tourism revenue for the country, and as a result are a clear case where conservation can provide local economic benefits,’ he said.

A global assessment of temperate slipper orchids found that 79 per cent of the popular ornamental plants, which have characteristic slipper-shaped flowers that trap insects to ensure pollination, are threatened with extinction.

Almost four-fifths of slipper orchids (pictured), which are found in North America, Europe and temperate regions of Asia, are at risk of dying out. Elsewhere, the banana orchid - the national flower of the Cayman Islands - has been assessed for the first time and listed as endangered, due to loss of its habitat

Their plight is the result of destruction of their habitat and over-collection of wild species for trade, even though international trade is regulated.

The freckled cypripedium, which has fewer than 100 individuals left in south-eastern Yunnan in China and the Ha Giang province of Vietnam, is endangered due to over-collection and deforestation.

Hassan Rankou, on the IUCN’s orchid specialist group, which is based at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said: ‘What was most surprising about this assessment was the degree of threat to these orchids.

‘Slipper orchids are popular in the multimillion-dollar horticultural industry. Although the industry is sustained by cultivated stock, conservation of wild species is vital for its future.’

Elsewhere, the banana orchid - the national flower of the Cayman Islands - has been assessed for the first time and listed as endangered, due to loss of its habitat for housing and tourism developments.

The Japanese eel is listed as endangered due to its loss of habitat, overfishing, barriers to migration, pollution and changes to oceanic currents. This eel is shown in a plastic bag on the way to a restaurant in Tokyo

All eight species of African violets, found in the Eastern Arc mountains of East Africa, were assessed and all but one are at risk of extinction, with three critically endangered.

The Japanese eel is listed as endangered due to its loss of habitat, overfishing, barriers to migration, pollution and changes to oceanic currents.

The Red List update also includes a re-assessment of the Brazilian three-banded armadillo, which is believed to have declined by more than a third over the last 10-15 years due to loss of half its scrub land habitat and remained listed as vulnerable to extinction.

But there was good news for Israel’s Yarkon bream, a fish species whose status went from extinct in the wild to vulnerable, as a result of a captive breeding programme and release of 9,000 fish into restored habitat in the country’s rivers.

More than 73,000 species were assessed by conservationists for the IUCN Red List, which is marks its 50th anniversary this year. The latest update listed 4,554 species as critically endangered, 6,807 species as endangered and 10,742 species as vulnerable to extinction.
