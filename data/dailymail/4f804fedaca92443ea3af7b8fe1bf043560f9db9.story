Marcelo has revealed that he wants to retire at Real Madrid and makes the bold claim that he is faster than both Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.

The Brazil international signed for Real Madrid in 2007 from Fluminese as an 18-year-old and has gone on to make almost 200 appearances for Los Blancos.

The 26-year-old took part in a Q&A with supporters via his Facebook page on Thursday and expressed his wish to stay with Real for the rest of his career.

Marcelo says Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo should win the Ballon d'Or 'without a doubt'

'I am very happy here and I want to stay here until I retire.' Marcelo replied when asked how long he wanted to spend at the club.

Another fan asked the cheeky Brazilian who was faster between team-mates Ronaldo and Bale, to which he replied: 'Me, hahahah.'

Marcelo also tipped Ronaldo to win the Ballon d'Or insisting the Portugal international should claim the prize 'without a doubt'.
