Murderer: Jason Mitchell, 25, became the second man convicted in the 2007 slaying of Redskins star Sean Taylor when he was sentenced to life in prison by a Miami-Dade judge on Tuesday

A Florida jury convicted a second man on Tuesday in connection with the 2007 murder of Washington Redskins football star Sean Taylor during a botched burglary at his Miami-area home.

A 12-person jury deliberated nearly four hours before finding Jason Mitchell, 25, guilty of first-degree felony murder and armed burglary.

Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy swiftly imposed the mandatory life sentence for murder, plus 40 more years for the burglary conviction with no chance of parole.

Although 
trial testimony showed Mitchell did not fire the fatal shot, prosecutors
 say he is equally responsible for the slaying under the law.

Assistant
 State Attorney Reid Rubin said Mitchell hatched the plot that 
eventually involved five Fort Myers-area men after spending time at 
Taylor's home near Miami, where he saw the player giving friends and 
relatives thousands of dollars in cash.

Rubin
 said Mitchell initially tried and failed to burglarize the home alone 
in mid-November 2007, returning with the group on Thanksgiving weekend 
to finish the job.

'It
 doesn't matter whether they planned to kill him (Taylor) or intended to
 kill him, he died as a result of that burglary and they are all 
responsible for it,' Rubin told the 12-person jury in closing arguments.
 'At the center of it all was Jason Mitchell.'

Mitchell
 did not testify in his own defense but he did confess to police in a 
sworn, videotaped statement. The man blamed for shooting Taylor, Eric 
Rivera Jr., was convicted last year of second-degree murder and 
sentenced to 57 years behind bars. Mitchell's lawyer, Robert Barrar, 
said Mitchell should be held responsible only for burglary, not for 
Rivera's actions.

'Sure
 Jason Mitchell was there. But Eric Rivera did it on his own, on a 
whim,' Barrar said. 'Jason Mitchell was not a part of any plan to kill 
anybody.'

Mitchell showed no emotion when the verdict was read.

Taylor,
 24, was shot in the upper thigh after confronting the group of burglars
 with a machete outside his bedroom door. The bullet severed Taylor's 
femoral artery, causing him to quickly bleed to death. In the bedroom 
when the shooting happened were Taylor's girlfriend and their infant 
daughter.

Police say the burglars thought Taylor would be out of town at a Redskins game, but he was home nursing a knee injury.

Aside from 
the confession, investigators found shoe prints at Taylor's house that 
matched Mitchell's sneakers and had cell phone evidence showing that 
Mitchell phoned another member of the group in the vicinity of the 
slaying that night.

Three
 other men were charged in the case and two are awaiting trial. Venjah 
Hunte, 25, previously pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and 
burglary charges in a deal that calls for a 29-year prison sentence.

Taylor
 was a Pro Bowl safety who had starred at the University of Miami. A 
first-round Redskins draft pick in 2004, Taylor signed an $18 million 
contract with the team and was becoming one of the NFL's top defensive 
players when he was slain.

'He had everything to live for,' Rubin said. 'Sean Taylor was on top of the world.'
