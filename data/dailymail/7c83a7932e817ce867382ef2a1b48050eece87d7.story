A man has been captured on video drinking an entire bottle of white wine in four seconds as his friends cheered him on.

The gentleman - known only as Joe - is seen unscrewing the cap before putting several straws inside the bottle.The straws would allow liquid to be replaced by air so the fluid can be consumed quicker.

Without flinching, he then puts it to his mouth before tipping it upside down 
and consuming the lot.

Going, going gone: The man unscrews the cap before pouring the wine down his throat

For the NHS, binge drinking is defined as drinking over double the daily unit guidelines in one session

Finally, he neatly plonks it back on to a table - which
 appears to be in a pub.

After necking the 750ml bottle of alcohol, the man gives a thumbs up to the camera.

The man's friends then gather around him - with one giving him a congratulatory pat on the back.

The person who uploaded the video on to the YouTube captioned the video: 'Our friend Joe has always been good at downing drinks so on this Monday night we tested him with a bottle of house white.

'DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME KIDS.'

He drinks the contents of the entire bottle before neatly plonking it back on to a table believed to be in a pub

Experts today condemned the video, saying it was 'dangerous'.

They warned the video may also be damaging for the man as it could be seen by future employers.

Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'Young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in, but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise.

'Quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess, there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the 'cybershame' some young people may experience.

'Drinkaware research shows nearly half of 18-24 year olds admitted un-tagging drunk photos of themselves that they didn’t want others to see.

The government advises that people should not regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines of 3-4 units of alcohol for men and 2-3 units of alcohol for women

'However there is still a chance that these photos may be seen by universities and prospective employers. So while it may seem like a lot of fun at the time, the range of negative consequences are no laughing matter.'

Binge drinking is defined by the NHS as drinking more than double the daily unit guidelines in one session.

For men this is over eight units, and for women, over six, the charity Drink Aware says.

However, the rate at which they reach intoxication varies because individuals are all different.

The government advises that people should not regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines of 3-4 units of alcohol for men (equivalent to a large (250ml) glass of 13 per cent wine) and 2-3 units of alcohol for women (equivalent to a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine).

‘Regularly’ means drinking every day or most days of the week.
