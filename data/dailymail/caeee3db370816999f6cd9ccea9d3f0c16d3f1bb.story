The force is no longer with Eric Hodgson, a California man who gave up a collection of Star Wars memorabilia worth more than $10,000 in a plea deal to charges that he defrauded a state agency out of nearly $1.9 million.

Hodgson, of Elk Grove, was charged in April with 22 counts of grand theft after the California Department of Transportation hired him to publish advertisements for construction contracts in local newspapers.

‘He instead used the money to pay off a mortgage, make purchases of toys and comics, and pay for exotic trips for him and his company staff,’ State Attorney General Kamala Harris' office said in a statement.

Bamboozled, they were: This three-foot tall Yoda figure is part of a $10,000 collection to be auctioned as part of a plea deal for a man who defrauded the state of California

Hodgson, 43, pleaded guilty on Thursday to defrauding the agency and has agreed to forfeit his Star Wars collection. He must also forfeit two residences, two cars and retirement accounts as part of the plea deal and faces a nine-year prison sentence.

Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for Harris, said on Friday that among the forfeited items now slated for auction is a rubber statue of Yoda, approximately three feet tall, complete with robe and wispy hair.

The memorabilia includes two light sabers and a model of the Millennium Falcon.

A sheister, he was: Eric Hodgson, 43, of Elk Grove, California used his printing company to steal over $1M from the state and buy the collection of light sabers and toy space ships as well as exotic trips

Worth the effort? Hodgson's dirty money was used to buy two model light sabres, among other trinkets

According to the state attorney general's office, Hodgson used fake invoices for print advertisements that were never published in local newspapers as promised.

His company Phenix was awarded two print advertising contracts in 2008 and 2009 that totaled more than $1.8 million. A third contract awarded to Phenix in 2011 for more than $800,000 was canceled before any money was paid.

An investigation by the California Department of Justice determined money was used to pay off a mortgage, make purchases of toys and comics, and fund exotic trips for him and his company staff.

Strange priorities: Hodgson faked invoices and pocketed $1.2M from the state of California, in part to buy this toy, part of a five figure Star Wars memorabilia collection
