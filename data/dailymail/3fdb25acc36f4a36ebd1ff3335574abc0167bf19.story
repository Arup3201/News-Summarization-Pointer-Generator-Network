Four years ago, the England team were setting off to a World Cup under a manager who claimed to need no more than 100 words of the language to do the job.

Roy Hodgson, when asked if he had the nerve to drop Wayne Rooney, should that be necessary, replied: ‘I would like to think that,  having been a manager/coach for a long time, I have the capacity to make the decisions that are necessary.’

That’s a yes, then, courtesy of a classic Royism. There will be plenty more of those to enjoy over the next few weeks, but it is not simply the fact that Hodgson has a better vocabulary than Fabio Capello which makes this tilt at the world title different.

England’s camp is a positive place, feeding off the energy of young blood and low expectations as they prepare for their farewell friendly in  London before setting out for the USA and then Brazil.

There are other differences. Four years ago, Capello had the FA in a fluster, first with his  ill-conceived Capello Index — an online rating  system for all players at the World Cup including his own — and then by showing interest in a job at Inter Milan.

Inside the squad, there were tensions as the manager tried to lure various stalwarts from  international retirement and undermined the confidence of the goalkeepers before subjecting his players to an extreme training regime in the Alps and an isolated boot camp near Rustenburg.

The hardline methods which made Capello a managerial legend did not transplant smoothly to an international tournament. He admitted this after England had crashed out to Germany in the last 16. He will not make the same mistakes in Brazil with Russia.

Hodgson has experienced a World Cup as a manager. He knows more English words and has generated a healthy atmosphere, although he bristled at the idea his squad were ‘relaxed’. Not a word he likes, apparently. Perhaps it breeds complacency.

Hard to understand? Capello's way didn't translate well to a major tournament

‘If I could bottle what I’m seeing in training at the moment and release it in Brazil then I’d be a very happy man,’ said Hodgson. ‘I’ve been impressed by the attitude, enthusiasm and energy and the quality, of course.’

Unlike at the European Championship two years ago, when he took charge very close to the tournament having quit West Bromwich Albion, this is very much Roy’s caper. This is his team, his captain and his spirit. He is tapping into collective success at clubs like Liverpool and Southampton. Hodgson selected five from Anfield in his last team — against Denmark in March — and they are all available again.

And he hopes Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez will help him maintain the equilibrium by  allowing him to take standby pair Jon Flanagan and John Stones to Miami next week.

If he does need to drop Rooney, Hodgson will do it his way, using his carefully-selected words. He  probably won’t need to. Rooney looks fit and hungry, in contrast to his demeanour in South Africa. So far so good, but Hodgson is wary of getting carried away. He will seek assurances against Peru that this team is evolving in the right way; that his direction is true.

The South Americans are not expected to be strong. They failed to qualify for the World Cup from a regional group without hosts Brazil and have important players missing, including Bayern Munich’s Claudio Pizarro and Schalke’s Jefferson Farfan.

England want to go out with a bang before a big Wembley crowd — Hodgson promised to keep any experiments up his sleeve for friendlies against Ecuador and Honduras — but will not issue orders to be careful about injuries.

‘Once you start doing that, you set yourself up to be injured,’ he said.

Instead, he will ask his team to stick to their principles and added: ‘We’ve been building up to get  principles of play that suit us. They’re the principles we’ll be  taking with us to Brazil.

‘We are a positive team who take the game to the opposition. We are prepared to accept the responsibility of taking the initiative in games. We don’t sit back and wait to see what happens.’

Aside from this boldness, Hodgson’s natural caution is ably reflected by his captain, Steven Gerrard. ‘It’s a bit early to come out with any ludicrous shouts about how good this team is,’ said Gerrard.

It is all about the opener against Italy in Manaus.

Hodgson said: ‘Most important is never to take our eye off the ball. Our job is to be in peak condition on June 14. It doesn’t help a great deal if you peak 10 days before or 10 days afterwards.

‘I couldn’t have wished for a  better week, as long as the game goes well. If it doesn’t it will be a great disappointment.’
