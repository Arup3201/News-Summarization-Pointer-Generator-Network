Two paedophiles who groomed boys as young as 13 online before meeting them and abusing them have been jailed for life.

Anthony Marsh, 53, who is HIV-positive, and Lee Davis, 39, were told they were 'predatory, dangerous paedophiles' by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court today as he jailed them for what police described as 'vile, horrendous offences'.

The pair, who are both married with children and live near Doncaster, used social networks like Facebook and Bebo as well as specialist gay websites to befriend boys before meeting them and sexually abusing them.

Salesman Marsh, from Hatfield, near Doncaster, and unemployed Davis, from nearby Consibrough, admitted a string of sexual offences against children, starting in 2004 by which time Marsh had been diagnosed with HIV.

The court heard of a series of 
incidents in which the pair would take their victims to woods, or 
Davis's van, or even the boys' own bedrooms when their parents were out.

Davis and Marsh would used pseudonyms
on the web but did not pose as teenagers as they utilised a range of 
social networking sites and communication sites including Skype and Grindr.

The court also heard how Davis had a 
secret 'dirty phone' and had sent and received more than 40,000 texts, 
following up his internet activity.

Judge Julian Goose QC heard how they were were both family men - Marsh a father of two and Davis a father of one - whose wives and children had no idea of what they were doing.

He was told how they spent hours online grooming their victims, most of whom were young teenagers coming to terms with their sexuality.

Sentencing the paedophiles at Sheffield Crown Court, the judge called them 'predatory and dangerous'

The judge referred to their youngest known victim - a 13-year-old from Lancashire - who was initially abused by Marsh in his own bedroom at home and then, later, raped by Davis after Marsh had passed on his details.

Davis recorded his abuse of the boy on a 45-minute long video tape which, the court was told, clearly showed the youngster in his bedroom, pleading with the defendant not to do what he is doing.

Judge Goose heard that the boy was particularly vulnerable as he had recently come out as gay and had been self-harming and subjected to bullying which was so bad he had tried to set fire to his own bedroom.

He said the burns from the incident were clearly visible on the film Davis made.

'Yet both of you groomed him and used him for sex,' the judge said.  'You, Davis, raped him. And videoed it.'

Judge Goose said it was 
'truly shocking' that Marsh had unprotected sex with young, vulnerable 
victims knowing his HIV-positive condition.

 'Both of you groomed him and used him for sex.  You, Davis, raped him, and videoed it.'

  - Judge Julian Goose QC, of the pair's youngest victim, 13

 

The court heard how the pair were caught after Marsh was arrested in May 2012 at a hotel in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, after he was spotted with indecent images of children.

Police eventually found thousands of images in Marsh's possession, many of them showing the highest possible level of abuse, the court heard.

Police found a library of films hidden in the cellar of Davis’s home showing him abusing the boys, and officers also established that Marsh distributed some footage over the web.

The pair were sentenced after admitting conspiracy to commit 
sexual activity with children, meeting a child following sexual grooming
and number of other sex offences - 55 charges in all - in September this year. Davis admitted 
further charges relating to indecent images today.

Marsh, who also used the names Tony 
Taylor and Tony Smith, admitted sexual activity with a child and 
possessing and distributing indecent images of children.

Davis, whom Marsh knew as James Parkin
until after they were both arrested, admitted raping a 13-year-old boy,
sexual activity with a child and taking indecent photographs of a 
child.

Marsh's convictions involved seven boys; Davis' convictions involved six boys,and four of the teenagers concerned were abused by both defendants.

Sentencing Marsh to life imprisonment with a mininum of 10 years before he is eligible for parole and David to life with a minimum of 12-and-a-half years in jail, the judge told the defendants: 'You are both predatory, dangerous paedophiles.'

Speaking outside court, Detective 
Inspector Delphine Waring, of South Yorkshire Police, said it was possible 
more victims had not yet identified themselves and urged any people in 
that position to come forward for help.
