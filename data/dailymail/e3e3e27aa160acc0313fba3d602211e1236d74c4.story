An acclaimed Hollywood sound editor who won two Oscars including one for his work on The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has drowned in a rafting accident.

Mike Hopkins, 53, died in an accident in a stretch of the Tararua Ranges on North Island on Saturday.

Two of his rafting companions survived, one woman who managed to swim to safety, and another who was rescued from the water.

All three were wearing safety equipment including life jackets and helmets according to local police.

Senior sergeant Carolyn Watson of the local police force praised rescuers for their efforts in trying to save Mr Hopkins.

She said: 'We would like to thank all those who assisted in the recovery of Mr Hopkins and the rescue of his companions.

'Particularly the jet boat operator who came to our aid and, at considerable risk to himself, was able to rescue the female.

'Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.'

He won his first Oscar in 2003 where he triumphed in the Best Sound Editing category for his work on The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and his second in the Best Achievement in Sound Editing for King Kong in 2006.

He was nominated for a third gong in the same category in 2008 for his work on Transformers but missed out on a hattrick of awards.

He was also nominated for five Baftas and six Golden Reel awards.

Mr Hopkins worked on all three Lord of the Rings films and his many other credits include Kung Fu Panda, Dreamgirls, The Ring 2, Octopussy, Blade Runner and Superman 2.

As well as his work on films, Mr Hopkins worked on television series such as The New Avengers and The Professionals in the 1970s.

He had worked in sound since his debut in the 1962 film She Always Gets Their Man.

His last role was on the 2012 comedy horror flick Fresh Meat.
