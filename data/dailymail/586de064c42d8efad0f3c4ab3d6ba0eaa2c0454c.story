A British woman has spoken about how her 16-year spending addiction spiralled so far out of control, she considered suicide.

Vikki Appleton, 29, from Cardiff told This Morning that she had over £200,000 worth of debt by the age of 19.

During her teenage and university years, Ms Appleton would foot the bill on extravagant nights out with friends, go on round-the-world holidays and even donate money to charity.

Big spender: Vicki Appleton says her spending started around the age of 13 when she had her first weekend job and would rush to spend her wages as quickly as she could

Out of control: Now 29, and in therapy for her spending addiction, Vicki Appleton still admits to 'urges' and counteracts them by buying healthy food from her local supermarket

‘It was a buzz akin to bungee jumping or doing any extreme sports and adding value to other people’s lives felt like a buzz in itself,' she told Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on the morning magazine show.

‘When you are desperately low on self-esteem you will cling on to anything that makes you feel like you are worth being around for.’

Ms Appleton says her spending addiction started when she landed her first weekend job at 13 and would rush to spend her wages.

'I'd be very surprised if I'd go home after that pay day with any money left over,' she said.

She didn't realise there was a problem, but in hindsight can see how dangerous it was.

And it wasn't until she reached 18 when the problem spiralled out of control.

'A credit card arrived through my door that I hadn't applied for with a limit of around £1,500 and I thought that was free money,' she says.

'Somebody had deemed me good enough to have it and, in my mind, I was OK with it.'

Ms Appleton was later diagnosed with biopolar disorder, but at the time says she ‘missed all the warning signs.'

‘Despite reading lots of articles and being well-versed in symptoms of bipolar, the mental illness and my spending didn’t seem to be linked,’ she said.

‘It was only in the last year it occurred  to me that the two were linked.’

She also admitted to owning ‘at least’ 15 cars - one she bought before she could learn to drive - and renting ’40 or 50.’

‘I don't think I've ever kept a car longer than a year,’ she said.

By the time she was 19, red letters and warnings from debt collectors and credit card companies were arriving thick and fast, but Ms Appleton panicked and fled to the Welsh Valleys to start a new life, going to university and ignoring the letters her grandmother would forward her.

During university she worked full time as well as studying and taking out student loans to ‘feed my crazy lifestyle,’ she said.

‘I was out three or four nights a week and made sure I had the best of everything.

‘I had top-of-the-range cameras for my photography degree.

‘In my mind I was well-justified having the best of everything.’

After
 university Ms Appleton took out more loans and credit cards and 
traveled around Asia, running out of money and relying on her 
grandmother to lend her cash for a flight home.

‘My boyfriend at the time was horrified,’ she said.

‘His family were very financially astute, his mother even worked for the financial services dealing with people in debt.

‘They tried to help me and were mortified. I didn’t listen to their warnings.’

She then became pregnant and was offered a new job.

She moved to a bigger house but eventually lost the job and found herself penniless and homeless.

Ms Appleton asked grandparents to pick son up and starting writing a suicide note to her son.

‘It was a heartfelt, emotional outpouring of regret at the fact I was capable of living a normal lifestyle,’ she says.

‘I was ill equipped. A shockingly awful mother to him.’

Writing the letter made Ms Appleton realise how serious her problem had become.

She called a helpline and a mental health team arrived at her house within an hour.

‘They told me, “We’re not going to force you to do anything but we recommend that you try going into psychiatric care. We believe it will help you,”’ she said.

‘I wouldn’t even have fought being sectioned at that point.

‘I was desperate for help and would have done anything.’

Still undergoing therapy, Ms Appleton goes back to the unit every two weeks for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and takes medication for her bipolar disorder.

The urges to spend, however, still haunt her.

‘It’s a chemical desire and still does overwhelm me,’ she acknowledges.

To combat the urge she’ll head to her local supermarket to stock up on fruit, vegetables and tins of food.

‘After feeling suicidal, I have re-designed my entire life,’ she said.

‘I am working towards being the optimum person I would choose to be.’

Ms Appleton was joined on the This Morning sofa by psychotherapist and wealth addiction expert Caroline Curtis Dolby, who named her problem as 'co-occurring disorder'.

‘Bipolar and addiction sit next door to one another,’ said Curtis Dolby.

‘Every person needs to understand their condition and then be willing to work with that condition.

‘It’s getting well and working toward a place where you can live within your own skin comfortably.’
