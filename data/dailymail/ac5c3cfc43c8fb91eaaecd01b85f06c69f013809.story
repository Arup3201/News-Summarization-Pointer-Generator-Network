Streets in downtown Los Angeles where thousands of Occupy protesters swarmed to stage an early morning demonstration have re-opened.

The protesters had crammed onto the City Hall lawn and the surrounding streets after the midnight deadline of their eviction passed, vowing to 'stay put'.

Four people were arrested for failure to disperse and a few protesters 
tossed bamboo sticks and water bottles at officers, according to Police Commander Andy 
Smith.

The LAPD yesterday revealed it was now on tactical alert. Deputy Chief Jose Perez told the LA Times it will see on-duty officers remain at work and police not responding to low-priority radio calls.

Following
the midnight eviction deadline, a celebratory atmosphere filled the 
night outside City Hall and the encampment near it.

A group of protesters on bicycles circled the block, one of them in a cow suit, while organisers led chants with a bull horn.

'The
best way to keep a non-violent movement non-violent is to throw a 
party, and keep it festive and atmospheric,' said Brian Masterson.

Shortly after the 12.01am 
deadline, there was only a small police presence, about two dozen 
motorcycle officers who remained across the street from the camp.

By 2.30 a.m., most protesters had 
moved from the campsite and swarmed onto nearby streets, putting them 
technically in compliance with the mayor's eviction order.

But at 4.50 a.m., police on loudspeakers declared an unlawful assembly and protesters were ordered out of the streets.

The
previously peaceful protest turned violent, with masked protesters 
taunting officers and throwing water bottles at police in riot gear.

Commanders eventually moved the demonstrators back to the City Hall park, telling them they would not be arrested there.

In time for the commuter frenzy, police cars began to leave and traffic was able to move along the streets.

Commander Smith said they won't raid the camp anytime soon but he hopes about 200 protesters will remain calm 
through the morning.

Prior to the eviction deadline, Mayor
Antonio Villaraigosa said the grounds would be closed after it had 
passed and protestors would be moved along.

But in a statement issued shortly before midnight, the mayor said police 'will allow campers ample time to remove their belongings peacefully and without disruption'.

Villaraigosa said police and social workers will walk through the park handing out information on the closure and services available, and expressed hope it would happen in a 'spirit of cooperation'.

But many, including the protest's 
chief organisers, said they had no intention of cooperating, and only a 
handful of campers cleared out over the weekend.

The passing of the LA eviction deadline follows a tense stand-off in Philadelphia last night between Occupy protesters who had formed a human wall and police, after the 5pm deadline to leave the Dilworth PlazaÂ site had passed.

Around 50 defiant protesters linked arms at the entrance of the plaza where they have camped for two months.

The deadline passed without scuffles or arrests. Occupy Philadelphia has managed to avoid 
aggressive confrontations so far, and on Sunday night there was hope the
City of Brotherly Love would continue to be largely violence-free.

In Los Angeles, meanwhile, protesters planned for their midnight deadline to abandon their encampment by holding an 'eviction block party.'

Nearly 45 minutes after the 5pm deadline in Philly, Police Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan said: 'Right now, we have a peaceful 
demonstration.'

A police presence was heavier than usual but no orders to leave had been issued as midnight approached.

The
mood was upbeat in the hours before the evening deadline, with groups 
playing music and singing hymns. A few dozen tents remained scattered on
the plaza, along with trash, piles of dirty blankets and numerous signs
reading, 'You can't evict an idea.'

'We
can definitely claim a victory,' said Mike Yaroschuk, who was in the 
process of dismantling his tent. 'We've opened a lot of minds, hearts 
and eyes.'

Yaroschuk said he
was leaving the plaza not because of the city-issued deadline but 
because of a request by unions whose workers will be involved in the 
long-planned construction project there in the coming weeks.

He
said Occupy's efforts to draw attention to economic inequality and 
corporate influence on government were more important than its physical 
location.

'This place is not a key battle for me ... this is a marathon, not a sprint,' he said.

Waiting game: Protesters plan to party and put out Facebook fliers for others to join them

Although city officials in LA had 
told demonstrators they must leave the weeks-old protest site and take 
their nearly 500 tents with them by 12.01am this morning, just a handful
were seen packing up Sunday.

Instead, some passed out fliers 
containing the city seal and the words: 'By order of Mayor Antonio 
Villaraigosa, this notice terminates your tenancy and requires you to 
attend the Occupy L.A. Eviction Block Party,' which the fliers' said was
scheduled for 12.01am.

Los
Angeles protester Brian Masterson said: 'The best way to keep a 
non-violent movement non-violent is to throw a party, and keep it 
festive and atmospheric.

Speaking as he helped a friend break down her tent, he said: 'I'm going to be doing as much as I can to stop violence.

'We can't beat the LAPD, but we can make it difficult for them to do their job, and have fun while we're doing it.'

He said he had turned his own tent into a 'non-violent booby trap' by filling it with sandbags to make it tough to tear down.

Standing firm: The scene at the LA encampment late Sunday afternoon

The atmosphere was festive on Sunday afternoon with a punk-pop band playing protest songs on one of the lawns.

The protest's artists were out in 
great numbers showing their work, and twice the usual number of news 
trucks surrounded the tent city.

Conservative
blogger Andrew Breitbart drew a crowd as he stood on the City Hall 
steps and argued with protesters on topics like Bank of America and 
Warren Buffett.

Some campers packed up their tents and belongings Sunday to avoid police trouble, but said they intended to return without them in support of their fellow protesters.

'I would prefer not to take the tent down,' said Tiffany Wallace as she packed up.

'But we need to be strategic for this movement to last. This is not just for the occupation of this particular location. This is for mobilizing working class people nationally and internationally.'

Digital fliers were being posted on 
Facebook and Twitter encouraging people to go to City Hall at midnight 
in solidarity with occupiers.

City
Councilman Bill Rosendahl appeared on the City Hall lawn to issue a 
late plea for protesters to leave. Occupy organizers said thanks, but no
thanks.

Julie Levine, one 
of several Occupy spokespeople, told the Los Angeles Times: 'Until the 
grievances of the 99 per cent are addressed to end corporate control of 
the system, the government and the media, Occupy LA will be here 
exercising our 1st Amendment rights.'
