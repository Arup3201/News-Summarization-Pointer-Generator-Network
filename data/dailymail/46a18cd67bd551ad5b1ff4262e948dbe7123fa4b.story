She is the undisputed queen of 'mummy porn' - her erotic tales of romance and bondage having both titillated and inspired millions of housewives across the world.

And now Fifty Shades of Grey author E L James is to release a new book called 'Inner Goddess'.

But fans dying to once again dive into her steamy world of sexual desire are this time going to have to do it themselves... because this one is a DIY guide on how to write.

Bestseller: E L James' erotic 'Fifty Shades' trilogy was acquired by Vintage last year and has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide

Vintage Books announced on Monday that
James has collaborated with the publisher on 'Fifty Shades of Grey: 
Inner Goddess (A Journal).'

It combines professional advice from 
the million-selling author and lined pages for readers to set down their
own ideas, or 'inner goddess.'

The book will include a foreward by 
James, excerpts from the Fifty Shades trilogy, writing tips as well as a
playlist of the music that inspired her to write.

There are also lined pages for 
jotting notes and sections devoted to her steamy protagonists, Anastasia
Steele and Christian Grey.

'As E L James traveled and met with 
her readers, there was a great curiosity about how she got started 
writing,' said Vintage publisher Anne Messitte. 'Her personal story as a
writer is inspirational to many women, and journaling has been an 
important part of her creative process from the start.'

Vintage says the journal will have a soft leather cover, 'bonded.' Vintage is a paperback imprint of Random House Inc.

James' erotic trilogy was acquired by Vintage last year and has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide. The 'Inner Goddess' journal will be published May 1.

Earlier this year, the multi-millionaire author told MailOnline that her next tome will not be as racy as her explicit hit Fifty
Shades Of Grey series.

E.L. - real name 
Erika Leonard - said: 'I've got so many ideas for my next book. But it will be much less raunchy and I will probably write it under another name and be done with it.'

From her modest London roots, James, 48 - who earned an estimated $9.8 million last summer just a few months after her books became a summer sensation - hit the Hollywood scene as she continues to discuss turning Fifty Shades into a big screen hit.

Universal Pictures and Focus Features paid $5 million for the Fifty Shades trilogy and screenwriter Kelly Marcel has been brought on board to write the adaptation.
