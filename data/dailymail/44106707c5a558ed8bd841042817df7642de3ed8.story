A super-slimming couple with two children are to 'remarry', eight years after their first wedding, to celebrate having lost over 11 stone between them.

Damon Clarke, a 37-year-old taxi-driver from Charminster, near Dorchester, Dorset, and his wife Clare, 31, first married in 2004.

But Damon - who back then weighed 25st 3lb stone - is so 'embarrassed' to look at their old wedding photos that he and Clare are going to do it all again, in order to generate a brand new family album.

Damon Clarke, 37, and his wife Clare, 31, have lost 11 stone between them since their 2004 wedding, and will now be renewing their vows so as to generate a brand new photo album of their second special day

Damon has lost over eight stone in 
just 11 months after realising he needed to take drastic action to 
tackle his weight when he became physically incapable of playing 
football with his sons Callum and Tyler.

He embarked upon a healthy eating and lifestyle regime - and Clare joined him, managing to lose three stone herself.

After hitting his target weight, Damon 
proposed to Clare for the second time, because he feels 'like a new 
man' and is finally confident if front of a camera. The couple are planning to renews their vows in Jun, at the same church where they wed in 2004.

Embarrassed: Damon feels embarrassed when he looks at his wedding pictures from 2004 and can't wait to marry his wife as a new man

He said: 'When I married Clare I was about 24 stone and my suit jacket wouldn't do up - so I had to have an extra button put in.

'When
I look at our wedding photos now I feel embarrassed. So I got down on 
one knee and proposed to Clare again as I thought, "I'm a new man and I 
want to do it again".

'I
look completely different to how I did,and I would like to do my 
wedding again because I feel like an improved version of myself.

'We are really excited about renewing 
our vows. I meant them the first time around, but now I am not 
only going to feel comfortable saying them, but feel comfortable in the suit I am wearing too!'

Second time lucky: Damon Clarke will meet his wife down the aisle for a second time in a bid to recreate their wedding day now that he has lost 8.5 stone

Clare
said: 'When we first met, Damon was quite slim - probably the same weight 
he is now. So when I walk down the aisle again it will be like marrying 
the man I first met.

'He has completely changed and become much more confident. I am so proud of his achievements.'

Damon used to live on a diet of ready
meals, fish and chips and takeaways. Over the years his waist six 
ballooned to a staggering 61 inches.

He said: 'I have always been a big person, even though I have played football all my life.

'When
I left school I worked at a fish and chips shop where I could have a 
free meal - then I started working at the taxi company.

'There's
a chippy next door and a Chinese and kebab shop nearby, so it was easy 
to grab something - and most of the food at home was from Iceland.

'I was playing football with my son 
last year and had to go and get a drink because within minutes I was 
sweating - he looked so embarrassed in front of his friends.

'I decided to do something about it and joined Slimming World. Since 
then, I have lost a lot of weight and feel like a new person.'

Different man: Father-of-two Damon had ballooned to 25 stone, and he decided to take action when he realised he was too rotund to play football with his eldest son

Damon's
waist size is now down to a trim 36 inches and he has had to buy new 
clothes from normal shops rather than plus-size catalogues.

His new diet consists of healthy home-cooked meals and he visits the gym three to four times a week.

Clare, an administrator at a care home, has also lost three stone by eating the same meals as Damon in the evening and has gone from a size 20 to a 14.

She said: 'Although I eat healthy food at work I wasn't as committed as Damon but still managed to lose weight by eating the same dinners as him.

'When Damon proposed I was shocked. We both weren't wearing our wedding rings because they were too big after we lost weight.

'He had taken mine without me knowing and had it made smaller for me. I am really looking forward to the day.'
