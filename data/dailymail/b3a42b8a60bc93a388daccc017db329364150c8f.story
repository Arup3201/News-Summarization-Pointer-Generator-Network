The father of Zahra Baker, who was 
killed and dismembered by her stepmother, has been deported to Australia
with his daughter's remains.

Adam Baker, 33, had moved to Hickory, North Carolina to be with Elisa Baker, whom he had met online and went on to marry.

Ten-year-old Zahra travelled with Mr Baker, who had gained custody of the child when her mother suffered postpartum depression.

But Zahra, who had lost a leg and her hearing to two bouts of bone cancer, soon began to endure abuse at the hands of her new stepmother.

She was beaten, left bruised and locked in a room for hours, according to police and ABC News.

Murdered: The remains of Zahra Baker were scattered across two counties

When she was killed, her disappearance was not reported for weeks. Investigators eventually determined she had been killed.

They found her prosthetic leg and parts of her body scattered among animal remains across two counties.

Investigators also found parts of her 
vertebrae which indicated her spine had been sawed at the neck. They 
never found the girl's head.

Adam Baker was never arrested in connection with the murder of his daughter.

His attorneys told WSOC that Zahra's remains will be buried in a family plot in Australia.

Baker left the country two weeks ago,
after he received a suspended sentence for misdemeanor crimes, the 
Charlotte Observer reported.

While charges remain against Baker in
other counties, his attorney Shell Pearce said he did not think he 
would be made to return for hearings.

His departure comes after authorities 
revealed last year that Baker was in the country illegally and officials
were organising his deportation.

Charged: Zahra's stepmother Elisa Baker, 42, in court last September. She pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and will serve at least 15 years in jail

Pain: Zahra's real mother Emily Dietrich, right, in court. Dietrich 
suffered depression after giving birth and gave custody of Zahra to the 
girl's father

Elisa Baker, 42, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in September last year and was sentenced to 15 to 18 years in jail.

She claimed she had found the child dead in her bed and, together with Baker, decided they couldn't report to police it as he was undocumented.

Adam Baker told his wife he 'would take care of it' and cut up the girl's body in a bathroom, his wife told police. He told his wife he needed her help in finding places to dispose of the body, she said.

Following Elisa Bakerâ€™s arrest, police found she had been married to someone else while married to Baker. At the time of the trial, he found out he was her seventh husband.
