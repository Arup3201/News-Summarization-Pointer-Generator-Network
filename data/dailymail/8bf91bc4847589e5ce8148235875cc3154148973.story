An explosion has ripped through a passenger bus in Karachi, Pakistan, killing six people and wounding 52 others.

Pakistan's commercial capital and biggest city has seen numerous militant attacks over the past 10 years and is also plagued by violence between rival ethnic-based factions.

The bus sustained serious damage in the 
explosion and a subsequent fire. While police said the bomb had been 
planted on the bus, provincial official Sharfud Din Memon said it was 
left on a motor-bike and went off as the bus passed.

Other police sources claim that as yet it is unclear what exactly caused the explosion.

Police spokesman Imran Shaukatsay said that they are trying to determine whether it was caused by a bomb or a gas canister. Many buses in Pakistan run on natural gas.

The blast that ripped through the vehicle while it was at a terminal in the southern city on Saturday set it on fire and reduced it to little more than a charred skeleton.

Some of the 52 wounded are still in a critical condition, according to Doctor Seemi Jamali who works at the Karachi hospital where they are being treated.

Karachi has a long history of political, ethnic and sectarian violence. It is also believed to be home to many Taliban militants who have fled US drone attacks and Pakistani army operations in the country's northwest.

Officials claim that more than 35,000 people have been killed in terrorism attacks in Pakistan since the 9/11 terrorism attacks.
