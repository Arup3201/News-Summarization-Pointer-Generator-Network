A six-year-old girl who was left paralysed and brain-damaged after a head-on collision has received a £5million payout in what a judge described as the 'saddest case' he has come across.

Cerys Edwards, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, will also get an annual £450,000 payout for the rest of her life.

Cerys was just 11 months old when her family's car was hit head-on by driver Antonio Boparan in Sutton Coldfield in November 2006.

The massive impact caused spine and brain injuries, leaving Cerys paralysed, unable to speak and permanently dependent on a ventilator as well as a team of around-the-clock nurses.

Judge Martin McKenna

Now after a long legal battle, Cerys' family have finally been awarded the payout by Judge Martin McKenna at Birmingham County Court.

Speaking as he awarded Cerys a lump sum of £4,971,675 and annual payments Judge McKenna said: 'I've had the misfortune to deal with a number of cases with serious injuries but I think this is one of the saddest cases I've come across.

'While money can never compensate for Cerys' injuries, at least they (her family) have the comfort that her financial future is secure.

'So I will make the order and I wish the parents and Cerys all the best for the future.'

Caring: Cerys, then aged five, is pictured with her mother Tracey and donkey Douglas, left. In the image on the right, a three-year-old Cerys is pictured at home with her mother. The child endured dozens of operations, spent seven months in Birmingham Children's Hospital, 16 months in a Surrey rehabilitation centre and two years in a temporary rented house

Speaking before Judge McKenna made the order, Cerys' representative, Paul Bleasdale QC, said: 'Cerys suffered catastrophic injuries in the accident. She suffered a traumatic brain injury and spinal cord damage.

'She was nearly two years in hospital and Cerys now lives in her own home adapted for her needs.

'She's ventilated, fed by a tube, and wholly depends on a team of carers. 

'The settlement is split between a lump sum and annual payments to maintain the around-the-clock dedicated nursing team.'

Outside court, Mr Bleasdale said the £5million awarded to Cerys was one of the biggest compensation payouts he had heard of.

'If it isn't the biggest, it's close to it,' he added. 'It's definitely close, it's at the very top end.'

Short sentence: Antonio Boparan, who was driving at 70mph in a 30 zone, served just six months of a 21-month sentence for dangerous driving. If Cerys had died he could have received 14 years

Boparan, from Sutton Coldfield, was driving at more than 70mph in a 30mph zone and was on the wrong side of the road in a powerful Range Rover Sport when he smashed into the Edwards' family car.

The millionaire's son, who was just 19 at the time and had only passed his test six months previously, would have faced up to 14 years in prison if Cerys had died.

Speaking at Birmingham County Court today, Boparan's representative, Margaret Bowron QC, apologised profusely for his actions.

'Those acting for the defendant are glad the case was settled without a contested case and hope it's some comfort to Cerys' family that her financial future is secure.

'Sadly nothing we can do will put her right but we hope we can do right by her with this settlement.'

In a statement released after the compensation was awarded, the family's solicitor Richard Langton, said: 'No amount of money can put right the damage done. But Cerys' parents are pleased that their daughter's future is secure, which is the overriding fear of the parents of all severely disabled children.'

Cerys' parents campaigned vigorously for a change in the law after Boparan served just six months of a 21-month sentence after being found guilty of dangerous driving in 2008.

A petition was delivered to Westminster by Cerys' parents in July 2009.

As a result, anyone convicted of the new offence of causing serious injury by dangerous driving will face up to five years in prison instead of the current maximum of two for dangerous driving.

Mr Langton said: 'Gareth and Tracey are grateful for the support they have had both locally and across the UK for their campaign to change the law. They hope that Cerys' Law may prevent further tragedies."

Cerys, who has been dependent on a ventilator and a team of nurses since 2006, received an interim payment of £800,000 from the Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group in 2008.

The group has also paid towards her care costs since she moved into an adapted home at the end of 2010.

Before returning home Cerys endured dozens of operations, spent seven months in Birmingham Children's Hospital, 16 months in a Surrey rehabilitation centre and two years in a temporary rented house
