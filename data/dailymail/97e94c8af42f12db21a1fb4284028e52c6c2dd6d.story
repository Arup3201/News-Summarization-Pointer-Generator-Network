The worst floods to hit the Balkans in 120 years have left at least 35 dead and tens of thousands homeless.

The rising waters have also triggered more than 2,000 landslides across Bosnia and Serbia and, though the worst of the rain has ceased, more deaths are feared.

The floods came after three months of rain fell in only three days, laying waste to entire villages and disturbing land mines that have been left over from the region’s conflict in the 1990s.

‘The situation is catastrophic,’ said  Bosnia’s refugee minister, Adil Osmanovic.

As well as the danger created when signs marking the unexploded mines were swept away, there were also fears that Serbia’s main power plant could be submerged.

The coal-fired Nikola Tesla power station, which supplies much of the country, is in Obrenovac, south-west of Belgrade.

It is threatened by the rising waters of the River Sava which have not yet peaked.

The cities of Orasje and Brcko in 
northeast Bosnia, where the Sava River forms the natural border with 
Croatia, were in danger of being overwhelmed. Officials in Brcko ordered

He called for the 
Defense Ministry to use helicopters to lower steel barriers that could 
be backed by sandbags to contain the water.

'It is a very demanding 
task,' he said, acknowledging that officials would have no other way to 
protect the port city of more than 70,000.

Civil protection commander Fahrudin Solak said the Sava River was spilling over another portion of the flood barrier in Orasje while emergency workers tried desperately to reinforce it with sandbags.

In Serbia, where floods have inundated towns and villages, authorities braced for high water that could last for several more days.

Large parts of eastern Croatia were underwater too, with several villages cut off and hundreds still fleeing the flooded zone in boats and trucks.
