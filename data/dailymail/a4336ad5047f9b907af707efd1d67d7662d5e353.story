For many, Jonah Lomu Rugby remains the best rugby game ever created. Although FIFA maestros EA tried to tackle the rugby market, each attempt paled in comparison to Codemasters' 1997 classic.

But that hasn't stopped Sidhe, the developers behind countless rugby league games, trying their hand at what's proving to be a difficult sport to crack.

Scrum's the word: Rugby Challenge may have some flaws, but it's on course to be a solid sports game

First impressions are promising. Menu screens are clear and crisp, and there's a FIFA-style glossiness to the animated background. Content is rich, too, boasting a Single Match, Competition, online and career modes to name but a few.

It's also heavily licenced - with more than 110 teams and 50 stadia looking exactly how they should. This includes heavy hitters such as the All Blacks, Australia and the Lions, not to mention smaller teams in the RaboDirect PRO12 and Ranfurly Shield. Unfortunately, South African teams are not licenced.

But for all of this authenticity, the gameplay feels very arcade like - a move which may anger purists. Fast and ferocious, there's often so much happening on screen that it's difficult to tell what's going on.

Core mechanics such as passing, tackling and kicking work well, though, and although AI running lines are not as refined as rugby fans may like, it's still very enjoyable.

Less enjoyable are the tedious scrum and lineout mechanics. Both involve time-sensitive button and controller presses to ensure success, but the margin for error is extremely punishing.

The decision to put all out-of-hand kicking into slow-motion, too, also jars with the ebb and flow of a match.

Graphically, Rugby Challenge 2 largely looks the part. Enjoyed best from a side-on perspective, animations generally hold together and stadiums are nicely detailed. Character models are less impressive, which is shame, given the number TV-style close-ups and replays broadcast during matches.

Sound has been noticeably improved since 2011's Rugby Challenge. Former All Black Justin Marshall is on hand offering insightful quips and critique while Grant Nisbett follows the core action. Sadly, commentary is not quite as smooth as you'd hope for, and more than once during the match - wasn't accurate to what was going on on-screen.

Arcade: Harking back to the days of Jonah Lomu Rugby, realistic gameplay has taken a back seat

But these minor gripes aside, on this evidence, Rugby Challenge 2 still looks like a strong rugby game, one that's sure to please many die-hard rugby fans.

Rugby Challenge 2: The Lions Edition is released on June 13.

Fully licenced teams but lack of South African licence is a shame
