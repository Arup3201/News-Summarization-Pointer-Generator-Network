EU migrants could see their access to benefits cut as the Government considers reducing the number of people allowed into the UK each year.

A leaked document has shown the Government could propose that the cap on the number of migrants from EU countries allowed into the country is cut from 106,000 to 75,000 a year.

The paper is also said to suggest that British people are given 'national preference' for jobs and that labour movement from poorer countries in Europe is limited.

A leaked Home Office document, which blames EU freedom of movement policy for a rise in homelessness and begging, has suggested slashing the number of migrants allowed into the UK from 106,000 to 75,000 a year

The report suggests the policy has had a negative impact on young British people and low-skilled workers

The document suggests that the EU's freedom of movement policy has led to a rise in homelessness and begging in the UK and also encouraged people and drugs trafficking, according to The Sunday Times.

In a review of the policy, the Home Office also reports that there is 'widespread public concern' about it and that it has had a negative impact on young British people and low-skilled workers.

It suggests that migrants should be blocked from accessing benefits and tax credits for their first five years in the UK.

The report also recommends that professional and high-skilled migrants from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria only be permitted to move to the UK if they have a job offer.

Low-skilled migrant workers, meanwhile, should only be allowed in if they find work on an approved national shortage jobs list.

The review, which is a draft, is also said to have claimed that freedom of movement has caused a 'build-up of social tensions' in UK communities, stretched public services and encouraged benefits tourism.

The newspaper reports that the proposed 75,000 cap is 'not yet' being strongly pushed by the Government, but adds that it may prove an important part of David Cameron's pledge to renegotiate the UK's relationship with Europe if he wins the 2015 General Election.

The draft report recommends that migrants, some Romanians shown here in the Marble Arch area of London, be prevented from claiming benefits and tax credits for their first five years in the country

The document, which remains in draft form, was supposed to be released last week, but has reportedly been held up by Liberal Democrats who feel it is too anti-Europe.

In putting the case for reducing the cap on EU migrants allowed into the UK, the review also quotes police figures from 2012 showing that of 292 people arrested for begging in Westminster, 207 were Romanian.

It also pointed to the fact that of 922 cases of rough sleeping in the same area, the majority were non-UK EU nationals.

The Home Office declined to comment.
