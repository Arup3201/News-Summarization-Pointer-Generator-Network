Steffon Armitage's hopes of earning an England World Cup call-up appear to be in the balance as the flanker was being questioned at a police station in Toulon on Wednesday night over an alleged assault.

The 29-year-old European Player of the Year was held in custody for several hours – along with team-mate Xavier Chiocci – in connection with an incident on December 13, after a Champions Cup match against Leicester. 

Several Toulon players were celebrating their victory at a Mourillon beach-side bar-restaurant and eye-witnesses have alleged that Armitage and Chiocci were involved in a fight with another customer.

A 30-year-old man is understood to have sustained an injury to his eye after being knocked to the ground. However, initial reports in France have claimed that both Armitage and France prop Chiocci told officers that they have no recollection of the episode.

Armitage voluntarily attended the police station to explain what happened and he was being held in a cell, but he has not been arrested or charged. 

Toulon released a statement on Thursday confirming that Chiocci had been released from custody on Wednesday night without charge, but that Armitage continued to be held over-night for further questioning. The club are expecting to discover on Thursday whether he will be charged and if so, they will consider sanctions of their own.

He has been in sensational form for Toulon again this season, leading to another nomination for the European Player of the Year award and growing calls for him to be brought out of international exile by England head coach Stuart Lancaster.

The prolific openside – who can also operate effectively at No 8 – won five caps for his country between 2009 and 2010, but he has been in France since 2011 and the RFU edict against picking players based overseas for Test duty has undermined his strong claims.

There is an ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause which can be triggered by Lancaster, but he has consistently indicated that he will not consider doing so until it comes to naming an expanded World Cup training squad in June.

Earlier this season, it emerged that Armitage was weighing up a move to Bath, to enhance his prospects of being recalled by England, but the deal fell through when the RFU refused to make a financial contribution. 

The former London Irish player also considered acquiring a French passport and exploiting a new eligibility loophole to switch allegiance to France, but that plan was swiftly abandoned.
