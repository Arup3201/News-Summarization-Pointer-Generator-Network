This is the man who shares his tiny one-bedroom flat with nearly 60 lizards, snakes and spiders.

Keith Ross, 24, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, houses 28 snakes, 14 lizards, three tarantulas, three beetles, five turtles and a tiger salamander in his living room.

Despite admitting there 'is no space for much else' in his home - the forklift driver also has two porcupines living in his back garden.

Luckily, Mr Ross's girlfriend, Darra, is fine with his collection - although she says she 'likes dogs better'.

Mr Ross says he would one day like to turn his hobby in to a profession - and work as a breeder full-time.

On his unusual collection, he said: 'I like different things. People buy normal things and I buy one step above them.

'I always buy something a wee bit bigger. Other people buy dogs and cats, I buy snakes and lizards.'

Mr Ross says he has always liked lizards and snakes - and first bought a rat snake when he was 17.

But his collection did not begin to grow until four years ago when he moved into his own flat.

At 15 ft long - his biggest snake is a sunfired reticulated python.

Mr Ross, who sometimes takes spiders and snakes along to parties to try and cure people's fears of the creatures, also has two porcupines living in his back garden (pictured)

The biggest lizard Mr Ross owns is a white-throated monitor at 4 ft - which has its own harness so the animal lover can take him for walks.

Mr Ross hopes to one day be able to work full time with his animals. He has already begun breeding and has so far sold one baby porcupine to a buyer in Portsmouth.

He added: 'I’m the only porcupine breeder in Scotland that has them. I’ve had one baby so far and that went to Portsmouth to an educational place.

'They’re really easy to look after. You treat them like a dog - you can train them.'

Mr Ross also takes his snakes and tarantulas to parties with the aim of helping people lose their fear of the creatures.

Of his enormous collection, which includes a 15ft Python, Mr Ross says: 'My friends are used to it by now'

He said: 'I had a carpet fitter in and he saw all my collection and came back a month later and asked if I could take a couple of snakes to his daughter’s birthday party and I got the idea from there.

'All the kids and adults enjoy it. Every single person who is scared of spiders has held one.

'There are more snakes and lizards than cats and dogs in the UK now.

'There is no reason for fear and that’s what I’m trying to get across, to be honest it’s adults who are worst and hang back, but the kids are right in there.”

Mr Ross has found his friends and family have accepted his living room menagerie.

He said: 'My friends are used to it by now. My mum walks in and checks I’ve not got anything new.'
