A drunk stag party guest has accused Spearmint Rhino of 'exploiting' him out of £7,500 in one night.

The Northern Irish man maxed out three credit cards and spent a third of his salary at the seaside strip club in Bournemouth, Dorset - including two £1,176 sums two minutes apart.

He said staff got him alone in a booth and plied him with alcohol, causing apparent memory loss.

He then spent vast amounts on 'Rhino chips', which buy private lap dances.

'Exploited': A drunk stag party guest has accused Spearmint Rhino of taking £7,500 from three credit cards. The anonymous man has fought his case for more than a year after the incident at this Bournemouth branch

In a complaint letter to Bournemouth Council, the man said he had been given so much alcohol that he lost all awareness of his actions.

He woke up the next morning to find credit card receipts that revealed £7,500 had been taken in 13 separate payments at the club.

They also included £2,304 taken in three separate transactions eight minutes apart and £2,928 in three transactions six minutes apart.

The man, who asked to be kept anonymous, has spent a year battling to get the money back without success.

He said he the club had never given him a satisfactory explanation for the pattern of spending.

'I fully acknowledge that I was foolish to enter the club drunk and in possession of several credit cards,' he wrote.

The man wrote: 'I acknowledge I was foolish to enter the club drunk and in possession of several cards'

'But I have been in similar situations before and never experienced anything remotely approaching this or involving such a life-changing sum of money.

'Someone being foolish does not excuse in any way the actions of the club and its employees and the way they grossly exploited a person in a vulnerable position.'

The man wrote his letter to Bournemouth Council's licensing committee after it announced it was launching an investigation into the club.

The Spearmint Rhino branch is alleged to have breached its strict licence conditions - including the customary strip club 'no touching' policy.

Undercover checks allegedly found dancers straddling customers, placing both their feet on seats, simulating a sexual act, intentionally touching another dancer and intentionally touching a customer. 

It is understood the man previously made a complaint to Bournemouth council's Trading Standards department and no action was taken.

But the complainant is being backed by Bournemouth councillor David Smith, who said it was not the only one he had received.

'I was shocked and concerned to hear of the experience this man had in Spearmint Rhino,' he said. 'I understand that when he entered the club he was separated from the rest of his group and ended up in a booth.

'He signed off chips on his credit card and he maxed out two or three cards and signed away £7,500.

'He has spent the last year trying to get the money back.

'People visiting these venues need to have confidence that they are run properly. Due to my concerns I have objected to the renewal of the licence and I hope the council's licensing board share my concerns.' 

A spokesman for Spearmint Rhino said: 'The allegation goes back to the summer of 2013. 

'The matter is now being raised as an objection to the renewal of the SEV licence which has already been renewed once since that date. 

'The allegation is denied and it is not intended to engage in a trial through the media. Spearmint Rhino investigate any complaints made and work with the authorities and banks in all enquiries they carry out. 

'The authorities and the bank found such an allegation was not made out. 

'If this is the same incident, and Spearmint Rhino are not aware of any similar incident then this was dealt with around a year ago.'
