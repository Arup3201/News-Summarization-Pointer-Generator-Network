Britain should be ashamed of the way it treats  grandparents, Jeremy Hunt will say today.

The Health Secretary will warn a million elderly are left forgotten and isolated because friends and relatives fail to visit them.

Citing the example of Asian nations, he will say families should take more responsibility for grandparents and not leave caring to the state.

Mr Hunt, who has a Chinese wife, will say he is struck by the reverence and respect for the elderly in the Far East.

‘In those countries, when living alone is no longer possible, residential care is a last rather than a first option,’ he will say in a hard-hitting speech.

‘And the social contract is stronger because, as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old.

‘If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this.

‘It will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents. Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. A forgotten million who live among us – ignored to our national shame.’

Mr Hunt will make clear that some families have no option but to put older relatives in residential or nursing care and should not be ‘condemned for taking that difficult decision’.

Mr Hunt will give his speech at the National Children and Adults Services conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, saying ‘entering old age should not involve waving goodbye to one’s dignity’.

He will add: ‘According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely.

‘Some five million people say television is their main form of company – that’s 10 per cent of the population.

‘We know there is a broader problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society.’

The Health Secretary will also hit out at cases of abuse in care homes and pledge to beef up inspection of both public and private sector homes.

‘112,000 cases of alleged abuse were referred by English councils in 2012/13, the majority involving over-65s,’ he will say.

‘Something is badly wrong in a society where potentially one thousand such instances are happening every single week.

‘Which is why I am delighted that this year, for the first time, we have appointed a chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe. Like all our new chief inspectors, she will act as a champion of the people who use the services – the nation’s whistleblower-in-chief.’

At the same conference, health minister Norman Lamb yesterday announced plans for tougher inspection checks to clamp down on rushed 15-minute care visits, which risk stripping people of their dignity.

He said that, from April, the Care Quality Commission watchdog is likely to be tasked with looking at whether home care visits are long enough to respond to people’s needs. And inspectors will also consider looking at how working conditions might be impacting on care.

‘The current approach to home care is not fair on those who need support, it’s not fair on care workers and it is stripping away the human element,’ he said.

‘Fifteen minutes is not enough time to help people who are older or who have a disability to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed. Some do not even get the chance to have a conversation with their home care worker, who may be the only person they see that day.

‘These tougher checks would ask specific questions about the amount of time allocated for visits and whether staff are suitably supported to do this.

'This is particularly important because these are services delivered in private, behind closed doors. I want to build a fairer society, and that means providing better care in care homes, and in people’s own homes.’

Last night, Caroline Abrahams, a director of the charity Age UK, called for a ‘seismic shift’ in attitudes toward older people and ageing.

She added: ‘As we get older, we are more likely to suffer illness and disability which can prevent us from getting out and about, and people’s social networks often shrink due to life-changing events such as retirement and bereavement which can increase the risk of becoming lonely.

'At Age UK we are extremely concerned that cuts to local authority budgets are exacerbating the problem of loneliness because they are causing the closure of many support services for older people, like lunch clubs, which can be a lifeline for those on their own.

‘These cuts are also pushing to breaking point many families who are trying to care for their older relatives in the absence of adequate support.

'Caring is often a 24/7 role that can have a huge physical and emotional impact on the carer.’

Inspiration: Jeremy Hunt with his wife Lucia Guo

The wife who taught Jeremy Hunt China's way of caring for the old

Jeremy Hunt became interested in the Asian way of caring for the elderly after marrying a Chinese woman.

The Health Secretary met Lucia Guo five years ago at a conference in London where she was working as a recruiter for Chinese students.

Her parents often travel to Britain and he is learning their language, Mandarin.

‘It’s quite halting, but my parents-in-law don’t speak English and so I get a chance to practise with them,’ he said last summer.

Three in ten Chinese families have grandparents living in the same household and Confucius, who taught about the importance of the family and the need to respect your elders, is still a big influence in the country.

In traditional society, it is considered shameful for children to refuse to look after their parents.

The vast majority of elderly people would live with one of their children, with very few living alone. Old people’s homes were once virtually unknown.

Confucian beliefs encourage the younger generation to respect their elders for their wisdom, and most important decisions are traditionally made by consulting them.

There is less of a culture of youth in China, with younger people expected to defer  to older people, let them speak first, sit down after them and not contradict them.

However, in recent years, things have been changing in some of the growing cities – with fewer believing they have to look after their elders.

As the middle class expands, many of them find they have little time to care for their parents.

A poll has found that around a quarter of Chinese senior citizens now live alone – something that would once have been unforgivable.

Mr Hunt, 46, who is the Charterhouse-educated son of an admiral, spent much of his twenties in Japan and may have learned about their reverence for the elderly during his time there.

Described as ‘ferociously bright’, his wife comes from the city of Xi’an in north-east China, near the site of the famous Terracotta Army.

The couple divide their time between London and his constituency of South West Surrey. They have two children: John, three, and Anna, one.
