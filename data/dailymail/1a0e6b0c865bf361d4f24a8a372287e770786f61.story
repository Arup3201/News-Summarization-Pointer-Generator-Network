It has been one of the most widely embraced cosmetic procedures of all time, but it seems our love affair with botox may finally be coming to an end.

British women are turning away from using botox and fillers after several recent celebrity horror stories – like the recent cases with Donatella Versace and Renee Zellweger.

More women are choosing so called notox facials and spa treatments instead of injectables – and sales up three times higher in 2014 than previous year.

Increasing numbers of celebrities such as Donatella Versace (pictured) looking unusual has been blamed speculatively on overuse of botox and filler, which has seen a decline in the procedures 

This week Donatella Versace looked barely recognisable when she arrived in Brazil for the São Paulo Fashion Week with a stretched, shiny looking face. 

The previous week Renee Zellweger shocked many when she appeared at a showbiz event looking completely different to her Bridget Jones days.

In both cases over-use of botox and fillers was pointed to as a possible cause and now as a result women are turning away from using them and sales are now in decline for the first time since they were introduced around 12 years ago.

Many are now turning to safer non-invasive anti-ageing treatments and facials which don't have any negative side-effects.

Beauty industry expert Dean Nathanson said: 'There has been massive switch from injectables to anti-ageing treatments clearly because women are concerned about the effects certainly for over-use of injectables.

'The move to using facials like the Skinbreeze micro-dermabrasion and oxygen infusion facial which was seen a 200 per cent increase in orders this year, and the CACI micro-current facial which has been dubbed the non-surgical facelift. 

'Both have seen massive rises in numbers of new clients, and we hear from many of our new clients that they are concerned about over-use of injectables and so in terms of anti-ageing treatments they are turning to preventative measures.'

Industry insiders have said that the use of fillers and botox is on the decline now for the first time in over 10 years and women are starting to move away, or at least significantly reduce the amount of injectables they have on their faces.

They appear to be turning instead to procedures such as Skinbreeze, which is a facial that includes a combined micro-dermabrasion and LED light treatment followed by an oxygen infusion of neo-peptide rich serums that inhibit muscle responses and therefore attempts to mimic the effects of botox.

Since it's launch it has picked up several celebrity fans such as Strictly Come Dancing's Kristina Rihanoff, Binky Felstead from Made In Chelsea and The Apprentice star Luiza Zissman.

The news that Botox use may be in decline comes after recent research revealed  that a shocking 84 per cent of youth-seekers admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their faces when under-going the procedure - or even if the injection given actually contained key ingredient Botulinum toxin.

Transform Cosmetic Surgery, who conducted the research also have seen an alarming 15 per cent rise in the number of patients seeking help following ineffective treatments with non-registered 'faux-tox' salons. Worryingly, they say patients come to them after being treated in a non-clinical environment, despite being given a prescription-only medicine.
