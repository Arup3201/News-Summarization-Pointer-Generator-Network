Disgusted parents today condemned primary school teachers after they set their young children the task of memorising a 'thuggish' song about threatening to kill people.

Pupils at Abbotskerswell Primary School, in Devon, were told to learn the lyrics to the song entitled 'We're going to kill you' about the Ancient Olympics as part of a project linked to the 2012 Games.

But the words more closely resembled a gangster rap than an educational singalong with most of the verses referring to extreme violence.

Violent words: Excerpt of lyrics from a song about killing people that were given to children at Abbotskerswell Primary School in Devon who were then told to memorise the words

Abbotskerswell Primary School: The song sheet distributed to 'impressionable' pupils at the village school included the lyrics: 'We're going to kill you' and 'I'll break your arms and legs'

Lines in the song, taken from a play called The Ancient Olympics: The Legend of Callipateira, include: 'You think you’ve got a chance, you think you’ll make us dance, but when you make your stance, we’re going to kill you.

'You think you’re really tough, that you have trained enough, but we don’t give a stuff, we’re going to kill you.

'I'll break your arms and legs, I'll make it that you’ll beg, for me to stop the pain, think again.

Apology: Viv Clare, head-teacher at Abbotskerswell Primary School in Devon, apologised for the 'unsuitable' song lyrics

'You think you're going to win, I tell you think again, I’ll put you in a spin, we're going to kill you.

'I'm afraid your time is up, I think it's time to ruck, so it's time that we showed our stuff, so the going just got tough, let me know when you've had enough, we're going to kill you.

'I'll break your arms and legs, I'll make it that you beg, For me to stop the pain, Think again.'

Furious parent branded the song 'thuggish' and claimed the teacher could not justify such lyrics being handed out to 'young and impressionable children'.

The first Olympics games, which started in 776 BCE, featured running, boxing, wrestling, and pankration - a type of martial art. The fights could be very brutal as they had no rest periods and no rules against hitting a man while he was down.

The bouts continued until one man either surrendered or died but contenders tried to avoid killing their opponent as the dead boxer was automatically declared the winner.

But the ancient Olympics were not just about sporting events but featured songs, plays and poetry as well. 

The ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event and were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus.

Artistic expression was a major part of the Games and sculptors, poets and other actors would come to the Games to display their works.

The play chosen by the school was a fictional tale based around a story written by a Greek traveller Pausanias, that described ancient Greece and the games, around 150 AD and translated by W.H.Jones of Harvard University in 1918.

The play charts the adventures of Callipateira who couldn't attend the games because she was a married woman so donned a wig so she could go and help her son to become an Olympic champion.

Inappropriate: Parents criticised the choice of song to to rouse Olympic spirit among pupils

The play book, which features many other songs as well as 'We're going to kill you', which can be purchased online through numerous school education websites.

But Dave O’Neill, the father of one of the school's pupils, said: 'I’m furious that anyone would allow children to recite, rehearse and sing this song.

'It’s supposed to support the Olympics, and this certainly isn’t in the Olympic spirit.

'Children need a good education at an early age, not learning thuggish lyrics in school.'

But the school’s headteacher, Viv Clare, has defended the lyrics, saying they were contained in a published educational musical about the Ancient Olympics that the school planned to produce to tie in with the Games.

However, they have withdrawn the song following concern from angry parents.

Ms Clare said: 'As soon as their unsuitability was brought to my attention, I told staff they must be withdrawn and re-written.

'I can only apologise to anyone who has been offended by these lyrics, and trust they have been reassured by our swift action to redress the mistake.'
