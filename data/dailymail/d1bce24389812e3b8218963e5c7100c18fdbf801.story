Outraged customers were denied their regular Sunday brunch at the local hotel because the keen cyclists were dressed in lycra.

Ross Powell walked into the Raffles hotel in Perth to grab a table ahead of his wife and their two mates, who had all just gone on a morning cycle, when he was approached by a staff member who confronted him with an unexpected remark.

'Sorry mate you can't come in here - we've got a no lycra-free policy - we can't serve you,' the waiter said.

Mr Powell was gobsmacked and told his companions as they walked in that they were not welcome due to their cycling attire. 

'I've never been spoke to like that - it was horribly humiliating,' Mr Powell told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I'm 43 years old and a father of two kids - I've never been kicked out of anywhere in my life - let alone for the clothes I was wearing.' 

His wife, Colleen Powell, questioned the waiter when the policy had been put in place and the waiter replied with two weeks ago.

'My wife pointed out that we were served in lycra the week before and then he walked away,' he said.

Mr Powell insists the move is blatant discrimination.

'I think most pubs and clubs want young people who are hip and don't like the older crowd as a general rule,' he said.

'People don't like the way we look.' 

'It would be considered discrimination if it happened to people with dogs or kids - or customers wearing high visibility clothing.'

Hotel management said there was no such policy but a concern for safety where some bikes were parked

Daily Mail Australia approached the hotel for comment but has yet to have heard back.

However, Colonial Leisure Group State operations manger Vern Fogarty denied there was a lycra ban to The West Australian saying the concern was residents complaining about some of the parked bikes causing a safety risk.

'It is not our dress standard,' he told the paper. 

'We've served cyclists in lycra in the past and we're happy to serve cyclists in lycra in the future.' 

Mr Fogarty said the incident was a miscommunication which has now been clarified with the staff.

But Mr Powell hotel's response was complete nonsense and that the message could not have been misconstrued. 

'It's an absolute smokescreen - it's just spin,' he said. 

'There was no ambiguity - he was clear about the policy.'

Animosity towards cyclists is not a new issue and Mr Powell, who owns the Canning Bridge Cycles shop in Perth, said everybody needed to 'take a chill pill'.

'We all need to get along - the roads are for both cars and bikes,' he said. 

Mr Powell said he called the hotel on Monday and was told he would be contacted that afternoon following a management meeting about the matter but was yet to hear back.

Mr Powell, who owns Canning Bridge Cycles, called for the animosity towards cyclists to be put to an end
