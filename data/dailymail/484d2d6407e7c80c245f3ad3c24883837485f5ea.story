Wales' matchwinner Gareth Bale emphasised the importance of points rather than performance after their 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win against Andorra.

Andorra took a shock lead in the sixth minute when Swansea full-back Neil Taylor was adjudged to have pulled the jersey of Ivan Lorenzo in the penalty box, before skipper Ildefons Lima sent Wayne Hennessey the wrong way as the home side scored their first competitive goal for 18 matches.

Wales equalised with Bale's header after 22 minutes at the Andorra la Vella before the Real Madrid star won the game with a stunning free-kick 10 minutes from time.

'To get us off to a good start is massively important for us,' Bale told Sky Sports 5. 'We ourselves have expectations. We want to qualify and if we are to, we have to come to places like this and get victories.

'(For the free-kick) I tried to hit the sweet spot and luckily enough I did - the important thing for us was to get it out of the way and get three points.'

Wales manager Chris Coleman was delighted with the victory but was highly critical of both the pitch and referee Slavko Vincic.

The stadium's artificial 3G surface was only passed fit for use by UEFA last Wednesday after original tests showed the ball was rolling too fast on the pitch.

'They (Andorra) are a fighting nation and when we arrived my heart sunk when we trained on it (the pitch),' he said.

'It shouldn't be played on at our level, the good thing is that we got three points and everyone else has to come here.

'I am delighted with the lads. With the expectation on us, it was never going to be easy - you couldn't run with the ball and we had to gamble at times. It's three points whether we win 1-0 or 3-0.

'There were half a dozen challenges that weren't very good. The ref should have clamped down but he let it go and we are a bit disappointed with that - we had a bit to contend with tonight.'
