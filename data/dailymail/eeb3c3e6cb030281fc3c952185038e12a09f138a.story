An ex-con accused of robbing a Las Vegas casino and spending the proceeds on prostitutes and bribes was wheeled into court today in a spit mask.

Scott Carmitchel, 34, was ordered to appear in court 'by any force necessary.' He was escorted into the arraignment sitting in a wheelchair with his body covered in a blanket and his mouth wrapped in the white material.

He said nothing as he was arraigned on robbery charges, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Carmitchel, a felon from Kansas, was was charged with robbery, grand larceny and battery and a judge ordered him held in lieu of $84,000 bail.

He also faces federal charges, with 
the FBI complaint alleging he stole $43,500 in the armed Bellagio Casino heist 
and $4,355 in a bank robbery.

Carmitchel is to make an initial appearance at 3 p.m. Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Leen.

Detectives say Carmitchel robbed a casino cashier of $43,500 at gunpoint on Friday night and later paid prostitutes at another hotel with the money still bound in Bellagio wrappers.

He was arrested on Saturday night.

The robbery occurred at 8.30pm on Friday when a man walked up to a Bellagio cashier's cage, pulled a gun from a backpack and demanded money from a clerk, who later told police she feared she would die if she didn't co-operate.

The arrest of Carmitchel came after investigators were tipped off by a tourist from Texas who said he became suspicious after a man paid him $300 to rent him a $405 room at the Hard Rock Hotel.

Scott A. Carmitchel, who has been arrested on suspicion of stealing $43,500 from the Bellagio casino and using the money on prostitutes. He refused to co-operate with police who had to hold his head in position for his mug shot

Police later detained four 
prostitutes who left the room, two carrying wads of cash with Bellagio 
labels. They told police the man was acting erratic, paranoid and 
delusional, according to a police report.

Investigators
 said the suspect acknowledged his picture was on Bellagio surveillance 
tape, but he denied that he committed the robbery. He told them he went 
to the casino but didn't remember what happened, an arrest report 
states.

Police 
eventually searched the room and found $10,000 in cash along with a BB 
gun that matched the description of the weapon used during the robbery.

They
 also said they found a shirt they believe was worn by the robber, a 
$1,800 pair of black Louis Vuitton shoes, and an $800 Louis Vuitton 
belt, along with recent shopping receipts.

About half the money taken remained unaccounted for, the police report added.

In his mug shot, police had to forcibly hold his head in position as he refused to co-operate in any way and was combative with officers throughout the booking process.

Kansas Department of Corrections records show a Scott Alan Carmitchel served time for battery against a law officer and a robbery in 1998, and he was sent to prison most recently a year ago for making a criminal threat.

He was paroled in December and the department listed him as 'absconded' with his whereabouts unknown as of May 29.

Las Vegas police spelled his last name 'Carmitchell' on a booking photo released on late Tuesday.

Kansas authorities have spelled it both ways but list his true name with just one 'L,' and list the other spelling as an alias.
