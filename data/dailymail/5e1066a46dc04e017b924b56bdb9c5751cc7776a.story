A deadly brain-eating bacteria has been found thriving in a Louisiana parish water supply serving more than 12,000 people.

Though no illnesses have been reported, the Naegleria fowleri amoeba has been found in the system running to Reserve, Garyville, and Mt. Airy, according to the  the state's Department of Health and Hospitals in a statement released Wednesday.

Infections with the bug are extremely rare - perhaps 132 cases have been reported from 1962 to 2014 - but of those who've fallen victim only three survived.

The Lions water treatment plant, serving more than 12,000 people, has been found to carry the deadly Naegleria fowleri amoeba in its water

The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that the state surveillance program was sampling Water District No. 1 when it discovered the system was not in compliance for minimum disinfectant levels that would control the bacteria. 

Louisiana required a higher disinfectant level after a 4-year-old boy from Mississippi was infected with the amoeba and died in September 2013 after visiting St. Bernard Parish.

The amoeba can survive in untreated fresh water, hot springs, and hot water heaters, as well as untreated swimming pools, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quoted by NBC News.

'Families can take simple 
steps to protect themselves from exposure to this amoeba, the most 
important being to avoid allowing water to go up your nose while bathing
 or swimming in a pool,' Louisiana State Health Officer Jimmy Guidry told reporters.

'It is important to remember that the water is safe to 
drink; the amoeba cannot infect an individual through the stomach.'

The water is being treated with chlorine, but any entrance into the nasal passage could still result in infection in the brain.

The bacteria is incredibly deadly, claiming all but three of the 132 people reportedly infected since 1962

The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that in response to the amoeba detection, the St. John public school systems is turning off water fountains at all schools.

A 60-day chlorine burn has also been imposed on the St. John water system.

The water lines will be infused with the chemical, creating a stronger and quicker effect than the normal process of using a combination of chlorine and ammonia.

Once the burn is complete, the state will perform another test.

The parish Utilities Department is taking immediate actions to fully
 chlorinate the water system and eliminate the threat," Parish President
 Natalie Robottom told reporters. 'As more information becomes available, it will 
be released to the public.'

This is Louisiana's third water system to test positive for the amoeba.

The St. Bernard Parish as found to have it in 2013, and the 2011 deaths of two people in DeSoto Parish were found to be because of amoeba infection.
