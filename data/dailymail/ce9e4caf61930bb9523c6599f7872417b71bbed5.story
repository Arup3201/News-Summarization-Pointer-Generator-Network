A reveller dressed as the Incredible Hulk is being hunted by police after going on the rampage and attacking a teenager outside a McDonald's.

Police have released a CCTV image of the woman dressed as the comic character, famous for violent outbursts after uttering the phrase 'you wouldn't like me when I'm angry'.

The images show the woman dressed in a torn white shirt with dyed red hair, and covered in green body paint.

Have you seen this woman? Detectives in York are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in the city

The attack happened outside a branch of McDonald's in York, which has recently lost its 24-hour licence after a series of violent incidents.

Police said a 17-year-old girl was attacked at 3am on Friday, 26 April, outside the burger restaurant when the woman dressed as the Incredible Hulk left the restaurant with a group of people.

As a result of the assault the victim was left with bruising to her face and a black eye.

At the time of the incident the woman suspected of the assault was covered in green body paint with dyed red hair. However police said she is believed to be a white woman, in her late teens or early 20s and around 5ft 8in with a medium build.

Detective Constable Cheryl Hunter, of York CID, said: 'This appears to have been a wholly unprovoked assault. Thankfully the injuries were not too severe. However, the outcome could have been far more serious.

The classic TV series The Incredible Hulk starring Lou Ferrigno first appeared on screens in 1977

'If you witnessed the assault or can identify the woman I need to speak to about this incident, I ask that you contact the police or Crimestoppers straight away.'

Last month council bosses ordered that the McDonald's restaurant must cut its opening times after residents said drink-fuelled customers were ruining their lives.

The fast-food chain's outlet will have to shut after midnight during the week and from 1am on Fridays, Saturdays, Bank Holidays and racedays following a licensing challenge by people living opposite it.

A City of York Council licensing hearing heard evidence from six Stonegate Court residents, backed by local businesses, Visit York and Guildhall councillor Brian Watson, that the restaurant's round-the-clock opening hours had led to a catalogue of noise, fights, intimidation and abuse and disturbed their sleep.

North Yorkshire Police said there had been 122 incidents connected to McDonald's over 17 months.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
