At the crack of dawn, gangs of black grouse put on one of the Scottish Highland's most bizarre spectacles.

Over the course of two hours, endangered male grouse puff themselves up, strut around, leap into the air, and square up to each other in an attempt to impress the watching females.

The black grouse is one of only three British species to exhibit this strange 'lekking' ritual behaviour.

Spring has arrived in the Scottish Highlands and the aggressive mating
rituals of the black grouse have begun. The bird, native to Scotland, is one of only three British species which
exhibits 'lekking' behaviour

 The practice involves males competing 
with each other on a patch of territory known as a lek - a circular area
 roughly 65ft (20m).

Within this space, five to ten male birds battle it out to dominate the centre of the circle and show off their skills.

Once the hens arrive, the atmosphere becomes hostile - the males jumped at each other, 'crashing around like dodgems'.

The dominant bird, which secures the 
centre of the lek, is marked out as the alpha male. Calls and posturing 
are then used to attract a mate.

In contrast to this lavish display, the females known as ‘greyhens’, remain camouflaged in their habitat.

Photographer James Moore, 42, captured the mating ritual in rural Aberdeenshire at dawn on Wednesday this week.

‘The males started to gather around the lek when it was still dark,’ he said. ‘All I could hear was them babbling and cooing at each other.

‘When the light picked up I started to see the birds' white tails and could make out that they were squaring up to each other.

Black grouse are game birds found in northern Europe's woodland and moorland. 

They are also known as black cocks and grey hens, because of the colour of the male and female birds respectively.

The black grouse population, one of the most threatened species in the UK, has suffered a dramatic decline in recent decades.

This was largely caused by weather patterns, changing farming activities and loss of food sources, such as heather and birch scrub.

‘Once the hens arrived, things started to get really hostile - the males jumped at each other, crashing around like dodgems.

‘I could sense the aggression between them from my hide. They were pinning each other down and I could hear their wings beating against the ground.’

The dominant bird, which secures the centre of the lek, is marked out as the alpha male. Calls and posturing are then used to attract a mate.

In contrast to this lavish display, the females known as ‘greyhens’, remain camouflaged in their habitat.

‘By gaining dominance, the winning male ensures he has access to the best females, and the greatest number of them, making it likely he will pass on his genes to the next generation,’ said Paul Stancliffe of the British Trust for Ornithology.

'The males started to gather around the lek when it was still dark,' said Mr Moore. 'All I could hear was them babbling and cooing at each other. When the light picked up I started to see the birds' white tails and could make out that they were squaring up to each other'

‘Some lek sites have been in annual use for many years.’

The black grouse population, one of the most threatened species in the UK, has suffered a dramatic decline in recent decades.

This was largely caused by weather patterns, changing farming activities and loss of food sources, such as heather and birch scrub.

At the time of the last national survey in 2005, populations fell from an estimated 25,000 displaying males in 1970 to just over 5000.

To thrive in the British countryside, Black grouse require need a varied habitat. Blanket bog, farmland, moorland and open all allow them to recreate more lekking sites as well as have cover in which to nest.

A complete UK-wide count takes place every 10 to 12 years, with the next one scheduled for 2017.
