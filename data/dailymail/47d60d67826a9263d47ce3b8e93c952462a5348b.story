David Cameron yesterday attempted to reunite his fractious party by throwing his weight behind legislation which would pave the way for an EU referendum.

He ordered a three-line whip on a draft Bill calling for the nation to be asked by the end of 2017: ‘Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?’

It will be brought forward as a private member’s Bill by Stockton South MP James Wharton, but the wording was chosen by the Conservative Party.

Tory MP James Wharton said he wanted Parliament to have its say on Europe before focusing on issues which affect people most

Mr Wharton, the youngest of the 
party’s MPs at only 29, yesterday topped an annual draw for the chance 
to put forward private members’ Bills.

Mr Cameron still hopes to claw back powers from Brussels by negotiation before any referendum is called.

Several Government departments last 
night issued a call for evidence on areas where Britain may seek to 
renegotiate its relationship with the EU, including rules on 
immigration, benefits, trade and tourism.

Mr Wharton was among 114 Tory MPs who
voted in favour of an amendment to the Queen’s Speech on Wednesday, 
regretting that the Government had failed to include legislation on an 
EU referendum in its legislative agenda for the coming year because of 
the opposition of Lib Dems in the Coalition.

Mr Cameron, who has already pledged 
to hold a referendum if he is Prime Minister after the next election, 
has agreed instead to throw his support behind a private member’s Bill.

Mr Osborne said the Tories would appeal to Eurosceptics in other parties to back the in-out vote

In a highly unusual move for such 
legislation, a three-line whip – the strongest possible instruction – 
will be imposed on Tory MPs in a vote on Mr Wharton’s Bill, meaning any 
members of the

The Prime Minister is preparing to appoint a new chief whip amid warnings that discipline on the Conservative benches is close to collapse.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox is tipped as the leading candidate to replace the veteran Cabinet minister Sir George Young.

David Cameron could make the change as early as July.

‘It is clear David needs a bruiser,’ said a source, adding: ‘Liam Fox holds great sway on the Right, elements of which look increasingly out of control.’

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and former chief whip Andrew Mitchell are also being considered for the role.

Government who might vote against it will have to resign.

Mr Wharton warned Deputy Prime 
Minister Nick Clegg to ‘think long and hard’ before ordering his MPs to 
vote against the Bill, pointing out that the Lib Dems had promised an 
in/out referendum before the 2010 election.

The row over an EU referendum has pitched the Coalition parties into their most fractious arguments to date.

But sources said claims that some senior Tories had begun to plan for an early break-up of the Government were ‘nonsense’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband also faces a
dilemma. Tory sources said that if Labour tried to block the draft 
Bill, it would show ‘contempt’ for voters who want the first say on 
Britain’s place in Europe since 1975.

George
Osborne revealed an operation would be launched to persuade Labour and 
Lib Dem Eurosceptics to also vote to support a referendum.

The Chancellor said Mr Wharton is 'going to have 
the full support of the Conservative party; David Cameron, myself, we’re
going to make sure Conservative MPs get behind it, we’re going to try 
and persuade rebel MPs from other parties to back us'.

Speaking during a visit  the Pudding 
Mill Lane Crossrail construction site, in east London, Mr Osborne told 
BBC News: 'When the dust settles people can see that the Conservative 
party wants to give people a choice, an In/Out choice, on Britain’s 
membership of Europe.

David Cameron published the draft bill this week in an attempt to show his commitment to a referendum

'We’ve got a chance to legislate for 
it in Parliament and it’s now up to the other parties what they’re going
to do. It’s pretty clear they’re actually against giving people a 
choice and that is going to be put to the test.'

Nearly half of British people would vote to leave the European Union, according to a poll asking the official referendum question.

The YouGov poll for The Sun found 43 per cent of people believed the UK should not remain in the EU, while 37 per cent said it should. People were asked: 'Do you think the UK should remain a member of the EU?'

Some 16 per cent said they didn't know, while three per cent would not vote.
