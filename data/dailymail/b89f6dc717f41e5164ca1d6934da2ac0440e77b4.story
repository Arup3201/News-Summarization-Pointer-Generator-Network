When travelling abroad, the familiar sight of your favourite fast food menu can be a comforting thing.

But beware. Selecting your favourite burger from the board above the counter could leave you at higher risk of suffering a stroke, heart attack or heart failure, depending on where you are.

A new study has compared 19 iconic products from global retailers McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Subway, Kelloggs and Nestle, and found salt levels vary dramatically.

Experts have criticised the 'chaotic approach' by manufacturers to the levels in various foods, which include a Big Mac, Cornflakes, KFC Twister burger, Bacon Double Cheeseburger and Fitness cereal.

A Burger King Bacon Double Cheeseburger bought in Canada contains 2.85g of salt per burger, while one bought in the New Zealand contains much less salt at 1.92g of salt per burger

Their findings reveal that selecting a KFC Fillet Burger in the Middle East, for example, will mean a person devours three times as much salt than if they had eaten the same product in Malaysia.

And choosing a Burger King Bacon Double Cheeseburger in Canada means you are consuming almost 1g more salt than someone eating the same burger in New Zealand.

The international study, conducted by World Action on Salt and Health (WASH), highlights these vast disparities in salt content, prompting experts to call for the food giants to reduce their salt levels. 

The average daily recommended intake for an adult is currently 6g, but is set to reduce to 5g by 2025 on the advice of the World Health Organisation. 

Professor Graham MacGregor, WASH chairman, and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University of London, said reducing salt levels in food is 'the most cost-effective measure' known to reduce the number of people suffering a dying from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. 

A number of the retailers told MailOnline salt levels in food is a 'complex issue' which is 'influenced by a variety of factors, including culture and individual preferences', that are considered on a product-by-product basis. 

But while the variation may appear to be the result of different taste preferences, experts at WASH said the theory is disproved by the findings.

A spokesman for WASH said: 'Global taste preferences cannot be blamed for the difference in salt content, as no one country consistently has the saltiest foods.

'For example, the USA has the most salty Kellogg's Special K, but the least salty Kellogg's All Bran.'  

Clare Farrand, international programme lead at WASH, said the study shows food retailers are able to make their products using less salt, but choose not to. 

A KFC original Fillet Burger in the Middle East contains 3.5g of salt per burger, three times as much as the same product sold in Malaysia, which has 1.05g of salt per burger

'Manufacturers are clearly able to make products with less salt, but deliberately choose not to, despite salt damaging their customer's health,' she said. 

'This study also highlights a lack of consistent nutrition labelling and portion size across the world which is adding to consumer confusion, as people cannot choose the less salty options, even if they want to. 

'Consistent front of pack nutrient labelling should be provided on ALL products to allow consumers to make better-informed choices.'

She said there has been a positive change over time, with salt levels falling in some products since WASH last conducted the study in 2006.

For example, Kellogg's Cornflakes in Denmark and Belgium have seen salt levels reduce from 2.38g per 100g in 2006 to 1.30g in 2014 - a reduction of almost half the salt.

A possible explanation is that the product is now being manufactured in the UK, where salt targets have been set, and sold in Europe.

The WASH spokesman said: 'The fact that they (salt levels) are acceptable for consumers across Europe further highlights, quite clearly, that reductions in salt contents are not noticed by the population and can easily therefore be achieved across the world.'

Another finding of the survey was that salt levels in Subway's Club six-inch sandwich has been cut in all countries included in the study.

Kellogg's Cornflakes sold in Venezuela contains 1.90g of salt per 100g compared to the same cereal sold in the UK at 1.25g of salt per 100g - a difference of more salt than a standard packet of ready salted crisps

The biggest reduction was seen in the UK, dropping from 3g of salt to 1.7g per portion - a reduction of 43 per cent. 

Meanwhile the salt content in a KFC Twister has also fallen in all countries since 2006. 

In Canada levels have fallen from 3.83g to 2.3g salt per portion - a fall of 1.5g.

But researchers said it is 'disappointing' to note some products have not altered the levels of salt across in eight years.

Salt levels in Kellogg's All Bran cereal in the US and Australia has remained at 0.65g per 100g and 0.95g respectively.

And in Canada a McDonald's Big Mac still contains 2.55g salt per portion. 

Alarmingly some products have seen salt levels increase since 2006.

McDonald's Big Mac in Malaysia, Singapore and Portugal has gone up in the last eight years.

In the UK the salt content of the Burger King Bacon Double Cheeseburger has increased on average since WASH's last survey, from 2.2g per portion to 2.64g - a 20 per cent rise despite calls to reduce the population's salt intake. 

However Ms Farrand said the UK is 'leading the way in salt reduction'. 

'The UK has set salt targets for over 80 categories of food, however this survey shows that more still needs to be done,' she said. 

Nestlé Fitness cereal has 2g of salt per 100g in Russia, while consumers in Chile can eat the same product with less than half the salt at 0.72 of salt per 100g

'It is also clear that greater focus needs to be put on the out of home food sector.

'Salt should be going down, not up.

'This is a major problem, especially with so many people grabbing food on the go.'  

Professor  MacGregor, said: 'Reducing salt is the most cost-effective measure that we know to reduce the number of people suffering and dying from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.

'At the World Health Assembly in May 2013 it was unanimously agreed that all countries should reduce their daily salt intake by 30 per cent towards a target of up to 5g per day, by 2025. 

'Our study has shown that many global food manufacturers are not doing enough to help achieve this target, which is completely unacceptable.

'Indeed this survey reveals a chaotic approach by these world renowned iconic brands and immediate action is required now. 

'Salt should be reduced in all their products to the lowest level in all countries, and further if we are really going to tackle the huge and burdening problem of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. 

'These companies need to take a much greater corporate and ethical responsibility for what they are doing to their customers.'

Reducing salt levels in various products across the world is a 'complex issue', the retailers told MailOnline.

A Burger King spokeswoman said the company, which operates in 98 countries, is 'committed to providing menu options' to meet individual nutritional needs.

She said they have 'successfully reduced the sodium content in many products around the world'. 

'As part of its global menu innovation process, BKC develops standards for its menu items,' she told MailOnline. 

'Due to varying local regulations, BKC allows for some flexibility in its menu specifications in certain countries. BKC’s approach ensures that all BURGER KING restaurants have items that meet our stringent food quality standards in each region.' 

Spencer Swartz, for Nestle, said: 'Salt reduction in food is influenced by a variety of factors, including culture and individual preferences.

'This is why Nestlé takes a product-by-product approach to its food reformulation efforts to cut salt.'

He said the company has achieved a double-digit percentage reduction in salt from more than 2,400 Nestle products, including cereals, since 2005, when the sodium reduction policy was introduced.

'The reduction since 2005 represents around 14,500 tonnes of salt and we will be doing more,' he told MailOnline.

'We have set the objective to cut salt in our products by a further 10 per cent by 2016. 

'Nestlé also fully supports the WHO target for salt intake of no more than 5g per person, per day by 2025.

'The challenge in all of this is to cut salt in our foods without consumers resorting to salt shakers or choosing saltier foods. This is why awareness raising of this issue and partnership with a variety of stakeholders, including governments, is so important.' 

A spokeswoman for Kellogg's added: 'Since 1998, Kellogg’s has been engaged in a voluntary effort to reduce the amount of salt contained in our cereals in Europe.

'Worldwide, Kellogg’s is continually seeking ways to improve the nutrition profile of our foods – including lowering salt– without compromising taste or quality. 

'These plans vary by geography for many reasons, including raw material supplies, product renovation schedules and cultural and consumer taste preferences.'

A spokeswoman for the SUBWAY brand said with more than 42,000 branches across the world, 'exact product formulation differs between countries dependent on specific suppliers'. 

'The SUBWAY brand works hard to reduce salt wherever possible, not just in the UK but worldwide.'

A McDonald's global spokesman, said: 'While McDonald’s is a global company, we operate as local businesses in a decentralised manner.

'Different countries have different menu choices, ingredient combinations, and portion sizes that depend on, for example, customer taste preferences, local regulations, local restaurant ingredient reporting requirements, supply chain capabilities, and the competitive marketplace.

'McDonald’s is working to reduce sodium in our menu items. 

'The timing and reduction amounts vary by country and menu item. Because nutritional values vary around the world, McDonald’s markets have different baselines for measuring sodium content and different opportunities to reduce sodium.'

He said they have made progress in Europe, where they have reduced salt in French fries by at least 20 per cent, and levels in Chicken Nuggets by 14 per cent. 

MailOnline has also contacted McDonalds and KFC for comment.
