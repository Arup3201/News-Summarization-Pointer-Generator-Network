A former nanny for three adopted children Las Vegas police say were subjected to years of abuse and neglect can't understand what took so long for authorities to intervene, saying: 'The system is a disgrace.'

Jan Finnegan has slammed the Clark County Department of Family Services following the 23-count indictment of child abuse and neglect charges laid against Dwight Solander, 50, and Janet Solander, 53, the adoptive parents of the three victims involved, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Danielle Hinton, 21, the daughter of Janet Solander, has also been indicted, with all three adults arrested on March 20 after the children told authorities they were beaten with paint sticks, forced to take cold showers and dry themselves in front of a large fan and regularly prevented from using the bathroom.

Adding to the alleged cruelty is the fact that Janet Solander is the author of a book called Foster Care: How to Fix this Corrupted System.

indictment after being arrested in Las Vegas on Wednesday

Finnegan said she first reported her concerns about the way the children - aged between nine and 12 - were being to Family Services last year, after being hired to care for the girls in January and February 2013.

'They did nothing for a year,'  Finnegan said Monday.

'They did nothing. The system is a disgrace.'

The three sisters were placed in foster care with the Solanders in 2010 and adopted in early 2011.

The Solanders also took care of four foster children, who were removed Feb. 27 amid allegations of physical risk, authorities said.

After the foster children were removed, Child Protective Services officials learned the three sisters had been sent to a boarding school in Florida.

When case workers contacted the girls, they reported persistent abuse and said they feared their mother would kill them if they returned to Las Vegas, the report said.

Investigators said the three girls were forced to sleep on boards without sheets, blankets or pillows out of fear they would wet the bed.

The girls told authorities their adoptive parents would make them wear their soiled underwear on their head or would stuff them in their mouth if they had an accident, and they made them use catheters.

Janet Solander imposed harsh punishments if the girls had a bathroom accident, sometimes withholding food from them for three days at a time, the girls told investigators.

They also reported their mother doused them with ice water, and one girl had scars that apparently came from her mother pouring hot water on her.

The mother also punished them with cold showers, pouring a pitcher of ice water of them and forcing them to dry off with a large fan, police said.

Janet Solander's book, which was self-published, is heavy on strict discipline.

Ironically, one chapter is called What Happens When You Are Accused of Abuse?

The book also describes behavioral issues among foster children.

'The easiest and most defiant way for a child to vent is by urinating or defecating in his or her pants on the bed,' the book says.

'This is where the rage could start for foster parents.'

Dwight Solander is accused of participating in the abuse, although he told investigators he only hit the girls with a wooden paint stick on one occasion.

Hinton is also accused of hitting the girls with the stick, but she denied the claim in an interview with police.

In May 2013, the Solanders unsuccessfully attempted to sue Finnegan for slander after the claims she made to Family Services.

Finnegan, who replaced a previous nanny, said she at one point even confronted Dwight Solander about the plight of his adopted daughters.

'I tried to talk to him and ask him why they adopted these children,' she said.

'He just got very defensive and said he never had any children and his wife wanted him to have kids.'

Finnegan said the Solanders had surveillance cameras throughoyt the home and the children were given a liquid diet.

Police reports confirm that detail, noting that the girls had stomach problems because of the way they were treated.

Police reports also show that in September 2013 — five months before removing the children — CPS staff snapped a photo of a bucket with a toilet seat on top of it and a photo of a board on the loft floor.

The three adopted children were forced to sit on the bucket for hours, and sleep on the board, the police report said.

Family Services has not commented on the five-month gap between when the photos were taken and when the children were removed from custody in late February.

Finnegan plans to be at the preliminary hearing on April 8.

The former nanny plans to be in the courtroom.

'I want to look them in the face,' she said.

'If you adopt a child, you should love a child like it's  your own.'
