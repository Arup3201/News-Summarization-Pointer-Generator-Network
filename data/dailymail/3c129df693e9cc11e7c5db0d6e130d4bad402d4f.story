A network of tunnels that make up what appears to be an underground city have been discovered buried deep beneath the villa of Emperor Hadrian near Rome.

Archaeospeleologists have begun charting the underground roads and believe the passageways would have been used by carts and wagons pulled by oxen to transport slaves, food and other goods below the estate's 296 acres of land out of sight from the Emperor.

The villa at Tivoli, near Rome, was built by Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd Century AD and was made up of 30 buildings such as palaces, living quarters, spas, pavilions and libraries, each surrounded by ornate gardens, pools and fountains.

Archaeologists have mapped more than a mile of tunnels, right, discovered beneath Hadrian's Villa in Rome used to transport slaves, cattle and food out of sight from the Emperor Hadrian. The main tunnel, pictured left, runs for half a mile to a 700 metre circular spur that may have been used to turn carts around

This map shows the layout of Hadrian's villa estate. The first tunnels to be discovered at the start of this century are marked in blue and travel from the Piazza to the Grand Trapeze. The second, red tunnels travel away from the Grand Trapeze. The green roads travel underground from the entrance hall to the piazza. The yellow line is the newly-discovered tunnel that is 2.4-metres wide and dubbed The Great Underground Road

The main tunnel, mapped by caver Marco Placidi and a team from the Sotteranei di Roma association of archaeospeleologists including Vittoria Fressi, is 10-foot wide, runs for more than half a mile in a north-easterly direction before switching south and leads to a 700-metre circular spur.

Experts believe this spur may have been used as a turning circle for the carts and wagons.

The passage has been dubbed Strafa Carrabile, which means Great Underground Road in Italian, and is larger than the other tunnels previously discovered under the estate.

It was uncovered when archaeologists found a hole buried beneath bushes and plants along a pathway to the main gallery.

Because some sections of the tunnel are blocked by debris and rocks that have fallen into them over time, the archaeologists also used wire-controlled robots fitted with cameras to explore regions they couldn't reach.

Another, larger tunnel was also found during the exploration that is 16-foot wide and could have been used as a dual road.

Hadrian's Villa was built at Tibur, which is now known as Tivoli, around 20 miles to the east of Rome.

It was used as a retreat for Roman Emperor Hadrian during 2nd Century AD. The villa was started in 117AD.

Towards the end of his reign, Hadrian governed the empire from the villa and built a court in order to have official meetings.

When the 
Roman Empire fell the palace was looted and damaged but the underground 
network is 'almost intact'.

The estate is made of over 30 building covering around 296 acres and includes palaces, thermae's (spas), theatres, temples, libraries, slave and courtier quarters. 

There is also a pool and an artificial grotto named Canopus and Serapeum, respectively (pictured).

It was named after the Egyptian city of Canopus where a temple, called Serapeum, was dedicated to the god Serapis. 

In 1998, archaeologists discovered a temple built in honour of god Antinous.

The villa was declared a World Heritage 
Site by Unesco in 1999 and officials are working to clear the tunnels 
and offer tours of the passageways by the end of the year.

However, there was too much soil and debris in the tunnel for the explorers to enter and will be cleared at a later date to see where it leads to.

Archaeologists realised there was a network of roads under the estate because wells were situated along the paths every 50ft in a uniform pattern. 

It was originally believed that a single road travelled from the terrace of the Venus of Cnidus statue in the grounds to the circular spur.

The new tunnel entrance discovered suggests that there were also alternative underground routes.

Other discoveries include the footprint of a baby on the cover plate at the end of one tunnel as well as a shell from the Red Sea found beneath the Serapeum, or religious temple.

Some of the tunnels under Hadrian's Villa were too small for the team to fully explore so the archaeospeleologists used wire-mounted robots fitted with cameras to track and map the areas they couldn't reach

Experts believe these decorated dishes may have been used to serve to the emperor, or used as souvenirs.

Emperor Hadrian, who also built Hadrian's Wall in the north of England, designed his villa based on palaces he'd seen in Egypt and Greece.

The villa was started in 117AD. When the Roman Empire fell the palace was looted and damaged but the underground network is 'almost intact'.

Vittoria Fresi told Il Messagero newspaper, 'The underground network helps us to understand the structures that are 
above ground.'

'All the majesty of the villa is reflected in the subsoil. An authentic villa parading parallel below, designed by Hadrian, which served to make even more spectacular monuments.'
