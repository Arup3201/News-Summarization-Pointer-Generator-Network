It is, logically, the stage of life at which we expect our health will deteriorate the most - and with no turning back.

But in reality, the over-65s say they feel decades younger and are also enjoying a new lease of life.

Official research measuring the nation’s ‘happiness’ found those who have reached retirement age are happier about their own health than they have been for years.

It may be the feeling of freedom that comes with no longer having to work, but the over-65s are almost as satisfied with their health as they were in their late 30s, according to the figures.

The Office for National Statistics found people’s sense of health and wellbeing are generally on a ‘downward trend’ from their teens until late middle age, before receiving a welcome bounce in their 60s.

And it appeared that even the 70s are a far happier time than the miserable slog of the 40s and 50s.

As part of a wider study of 40,000 households in 2010 to 2011, people were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their overall health. They were also asked if any conditions limit their everyday activities.

Overall, two-thirds said they were satisfied with their health. Unsurprisingly, those aged 16 to 24 gave their health a high 75 per cent rating. This dropped to 70 per cent for those in their late 20s and early 30s.

By the late 30s it falls to 69 per cent and continues through middle age to just over 60 per cent by the age of 59.

Then comes a sudden improvement as life seems to become a lot rosier. The satisfaction rating increases to 67 per cent among people aged from 65 to 70.

Pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘The social narrative is you reach retirement and you are decrepit or infirm or you are going to get ill, but now most people find that isn’t the case.

‘In terms of health, there will be a strand where people would have expected they wouldn’t have good health in their 60s and are pleasantly surprised to find they do.’
