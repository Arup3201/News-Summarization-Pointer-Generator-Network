Just over a week after he suffered bruising, a fractured rib, a bruised lung and a dislocated finger in a crash with a white van, Bradley Wiggins was back on his bike again this morning.

The Tour de France winner and four-time Olympic champion looked to have made a speedy recovery from his injuries as he rode near his home in Eccleston, Lancashire.

And as these pictures show, Wiggins seemed in rather a better mood than when he was snapped leaving hospital after the crash, when he made a crude one-fingered gesture at photographers.

His wife Catherine later took to Twitter to defend his behaviour.

'Obviously you would give a Keats recital in a similar situation when 
in pain with a pap stopping you go into your house,' she wrote.

The cyclist himself later apologised for the gesture, saying he was 'tired and in a lot of pain'.

Today he was, unsurprisingly, rather more relaxed and offered a different salute for the snappers: a thumbs-up.

The 32-year-old was forced to spend a night in hospital in Preston after a vehicle collided with him on the evening of November 7 near his home in Lancashire.

Wiggins was thrown off his bike when a white Vauxhall Astra Envoy is thought to have pulled out of a petrol station in Wrightington and collided with him.

Garage attendant Yasmin Smith said the cyclist was in a lot of pain after the collision an even turned blue before the ambulance arrive. 

'He got put in a local person's car and when the ambulance came they attended to him immediately. His wife [tried to] hug him and he said: 'Don't, my ribs'.

'He was assisted [in] walking to the ambulance. He could stand up. I think his ribs and hands were the main concern,' she told The Sun.

The cyclist's wife also 
allegedly tried to confront the van driver and apparently had to be 
restrained after learning of the accident

'‘The van driver kept saying over and over, “What have I done? Oh my God, I've just knocked over Bradley Wiggins,”’ the garage attendant said.

The alleged driver of the van, Cath Burrows, 44, was later reported for summons by Lancashire police over driving without due care and attention.

Wiggins became Le Tour's first British winner in July before winning Olympic time-trial gold at Hampton Court on August 1.

The cyclist is the red-hot 
favourite to land the BBC's prestigious Sports Personality of the Year 
award on December 16, although his rude gesture at photographers on 
leaving hospital could yet alienate potential voters.
