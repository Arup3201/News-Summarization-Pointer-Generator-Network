Guarding the Ecuadorian embassy in London where Julian Assange has claimed asylum has now cost taxpayers  £9million, it has been revealed.

Metropolitan Police officers have been standing outside the Knightsbridge building since the WikiLeaks founder took refuge there in June 2012 - a vigil costing £11,000 per day.

The 43-year-old is wanted in Sweden after allegedly sexually assaulting two women in Stockholm in 2010.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been at the Ecuadorian embassy in west London since June 2012

British taxpayers have now spent £9m on guarding the embassy in Knightsbridge where Assange is staying

In November, a Swedish appeal court upheld the arrest warrant against the WikiLeaks founder. 

Mr Assange, who denies the allegations and has not been charged, has sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy to avoid extradition.

If he goes to Sweden, he fears he could be extradited to the US to face charges of leaking government documents.

WikiLeaks has published thousands of secret documents, which have enraged the White House and lifted the lid on diplomatic relations.

Police officers stationed outside the embassy round the clock are under orders to arrest him if he tries to leave. 

At all times there are three Scotland Yard officers waiting outside the embassy.

At least one stands on the steps and others will question visitors leaving in case it is Assange in disguise. 

Baroness Jenny Jones, deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee at the London Assembly, told MailOnline: 'The policing bill for keeping one man holed up in an embassy has reached yet more ridiculous proportions. 

The Government has yet to explain why taxpayers have to pay for this. It's time to end the stalemate and stand down the officers.'

The hacker has endured a self-imposed imprisonment in a single room after being given diplomatic asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy.

Assange is still unapologetic about his role in helping to disclose government secrets.

The embassy — strewn with red, yellow and blue Ecuadorian flags — takes up a single floor of a block behind Harrods.

Initially, Assange slept on an inflatable mattress donated by embassy staff, who are described as having become 'like family' to him.

But when it became clear his stay was not going to be temporary, a small room was transformed into his living quarters and a bed installed.

In August, it was revealed he was suffering from arrhythmia, which is a form of irregular heartbeat, a chronic cough and high blood pressure because of his confinement to the air-conditioned interior of the embassy. 

WikiLeaks sources also said the lack of Vitamin D, which is produced by exposure to sunshine, was damaging his health and could lead to a host of conditions including asthma, diabetes, weak bones and even heightened risk of dementia.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'The estimated direct cost of policing the Ecuadorian embassy between June 2012 and the end of October 2014 is £7.3 million, of which £5.5 million is opportunity costs (Police Officer Pay costs that would be incurred in normal duties) and £1.8 million additional costs (estimated additional Police Overtime as a direct result of the deployments at the Ecuadorian embassy).

'The estimated full cost including indirect costs for the same period would be £9.0m. The costs provided are an estimate based on averages as actual salary and overtime costs will vary daily.' 

Andy Silvester from the Taxpayers Alliance said: 'Despite his legion of celebrity fans, Assange should be treated like any other accused criminal. 

'The Government must redouble the pressure on the Ecuadorian authorities to bring this charade to an end, as there is little sign of progress and the bill climbs ever higher. The police have better things to do than a Knightsbridge vigil.' 

October 2006 – Assange sets up WikiLeaks for anonymous whistleblowers.

December 2010 – US vice president Joe Biden dubs Assange a 'terrorist'. He is arrested by British police and later released on bail.

February 2011 – A High Court in London approves Sweden's extradition request.

April 2011 – WikiLeaks publishes files from Guantanamo Bay revealing details of detainees.

November 2011 – High Court dismisses Assange's appeal against extradition. He takes it to the UK's Supreme Court. 

May 2012 – Supreme Court upholds the High Court's decision to surrender Assange to Sweden.
