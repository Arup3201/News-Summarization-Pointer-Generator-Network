The yacht of media mogul Kerry Stokes has been stormed by pirates off the coast of Papua New Guinea.

The Channel Seven boss' boat was boarded by thieves on Friday morning as it anchored near Krangket Island, close to Madang on the country's east coast, to refuel after travelling from Cairns. 

A spokeswoman for the Seven Network confirmed to AAP the boat was robbed at the end of last week, but Mr Stokes and his family did not arrive in the area until Sunday.

Thieves boarded the yacht after using a row boat to reach the vessel.

'The yacht was robbed and the thieves were confronted by the crew,' the spokeswoman said.

'The family have been travelling up there for years and the people up there are wonderful. 

'This is out of character.'

Former Madang governor Peter Barter said the boat refuelled at a local marina on Friday before travelling out to Krangket Island.

'They did not want to make an issue over this incident but we insisted that a report was made to police,' Mr Barter said.

A spokeswoman for Channel Seven said Mr Stokes and his family were not on board at the time

'Regretfully this incident is already known around Cairns and will deter motor yachts [and] tourists from visiting Madang and PNG.'

Mr Barter said Mr Stokes' yacht went in to lockdown after the incident.

Thieves took watches, mobile phones, laptops, diving equipment and cash in the early hours of the morning, the ABC reported.

PNG police in Port Moresby said they were aware of the incident and were expected to comment later on Tuesday.

Comment is also expected from the nation's Department of Tourism.
