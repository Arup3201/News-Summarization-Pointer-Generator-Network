Liliane Durden was killed when MH17 crashed in Ukraine earlier this month

The daughters of MH17 victim Liliane Durden fear their mother's body is being treating like a 'sack of potatoes' and her precious jewellery has been looted.Â 

'Mum... didn't have a lot of possessions, the jewellery that she has, she would be wearing,' her youngest daughter Chelsea said.

'We come home and we try to mourn by going through her things and there isn't much so the fact that people could be going and taking her only pieces of jewellery, which we would love to have, is devastating.

Liliane's eldest daughter Cassie said her mother's jewellery included their grandparents' wedding rings, reported Channel 9 60 Minutes.

Chelsea compared the treatment of bodies at the crash site, including their mother's, to a 'sack of potatoes',

'Completely inhumane,' Cassie said of the treatment of bodies following the crash. 'I'm disgusted, absolutely disgusted at the way people have treated this.'

'(People) treated these people like they're nothing, like a they're a bit of meat or like a trophy,' she said.

The sisters' are now hoping their mother's body can be identified so it can be quickly returned to Australia so they can honour her wishes and spread her ashes along her favourite stretch of coastline.

'Hopefully we'll be able to do that sooner rather and later,' Cassie said. 'We just got to make mum proud.'

'We just want her home, that's what we need,' Chelsea added.

The ACT mother was in Europe visiting family and eager to see her daughters and also her granddaughter Ella and 'all she talked about was Ella.'

'I know how much she loved Ella and I know how much Ella would have loved her,' Cassie said.

'She'll never see us get married... me have kids - there's a lot she's going to miss out on, She was young, she was only 50,' said Chelsea. 'She was a very young 50 as well.. she was full of energy, just an amazing person.'

After first learning of the crash, Chelsea was hysterical when she called Cassie at home in Perth about the plane going down and both sisters said they had a 'feeling' of knowing their mother had been killed on the plane. 'It's like we knew straight away, Chelsea said.
