Kenny Miller admits Wednesday's shock Petrofac Training Cup exit to part-time Alloa was his darkest day in football.

Miller and Dean Shiels had put the Ibrox side on course for next April's final with Livingston with two goals early in the second half.

But they imploded in the final 17 minutes as they let Barry Smith's minnows score three times to snatch victory.

Boss Ally McCoist refused to say after the match if the 3-2 defeat was the worst of his Ibrox reign.

Miller, though, did confess that he has never felt lower than he has ever done as he trudged off the plastic pitch at the Indodrill Stadium.

He said: 'What happened in that last 20 minutes was unacceptable. We lost three poor goals and it was a really, really disappointing result for us.

'It was a game we had won. But credit to Alloa. A lot of teams when they go a couple of goals down to the Old Firm fold. But they kept going and punished us.

'The feeling off the back of that result is probably the most disappointed I've been.

'I've been on the end of some hammerings in my time but to lose the game in the manner we did was really disappointing.'
