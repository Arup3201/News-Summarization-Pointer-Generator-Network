Are parents who opt for cosmetic surgery on their face unintentionally ruining their relationship with their children?

Studies suggest that having Botox injections could alter the way infants perceive adults, leaving them unable to recognise emotion.

This means that when an nip and tucked mother tries to empathise, the baby is left distraught as the adult seemingly appears unaffected by their behaviour.

Is cosmetic surgery leaving babies emotionally detached from their mothers? Studies suggest that 'enhancements' such as Botox injections make it difficult for children to empathise with adults and recognise emotion in parents (stock image shown)

Last year more than 50,000 cosmetic surgery procedures were carried out in the UK - a rise of 17 per cent on average from 2012.

More than five in six people who have had Botox admit to having no idea what exactly was injected into their face.

And new figures reveal today that more people than ever are seeking help after botched procedures.

A shocking 84 per cent of youth-seekers 
admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their
faces when under-going the procedure - or even if the injection 
given actually contained key ingredient Botulinum toxin.

The national research carried out by the Transform Cosmetic Surgery company has found that almost a third (29 per cent) of
 respondents said they had their treatment done at a local beauty salon,
 one in ten had one at home or a friend's home, and 3 per cent were 
treated at a 'beauty treatment party'.

And there doesn’t seem to be any signs of the trend abating.

By 2015 the global value of the plastic surgery industry is set to rise to £3.6 billion ($6 billion), a rise of £1.3 billion ($2.2 billion) from 2010.

A study carried out by Dr David Neal from the University of California in 2011 fouind that infants were unable to get an emotional response from adults who had had Botox injections.

This left them distressed and upset as they lacked the ability to be empathetic with their parents.

Dr Neal said that when infants were unable to mimic their parents’ emotions, such as showing sadness or happiness, they could sometimes be left confused.

This suggests that, as more and more parents today turn to Botox to supposedly ‘improve’ their appearance in later life, they might be worsening their relationship with their children.

This research has come to the fore again in recent days after a British artist spoke out against the use of plastic surgery in parents at the Hay Festival in the Brecon Beacons National Park.

As reported by The Times, Jonathan Yeo said that cosmetic surgery was ‘homogenising the way we look’ in addition to the aforementioned negative effects on appearance.

‘What are the unintended long-term consequences of these things that we are doing casually for our own gratification?

‘Aside from the fact it is risky, it is painful, it is expensive, it is often quite obvious you have had it done.’

Yeo has himself studied cosmetic-surgery patients and their sometimes painful pursuits of achieving physical perfection.

He says that, in the future, we may find the age of plastic surgery rather odd.

‘It is a funny time. I think we will look back on this time like we do on people using leeches and wonder why we did it,’ he said.

‘I think it is quite crazy. I want to document it. It is the big story of our era.’

Jonathan Yeo, pictured, discussed at the Hay Festival some of his own research into cosmetic surgery that suggests it emotionally detaches parents and children. He is known for portraits of several high-profile people including an infamous piece of President George Push made out of cuttings from pornographic magazines
