Party packs for celebrating the death of Baroness Thatcher, on sale at the TUC conference, were condemned yesterday as ‘grotesque and obscene’.

The boxes, which contain balloons, party whistles and indoor fireworks, were so popular that they sold out on the second day of the conference in Brighton.

The pack, sold by a socialist bookstall called Bookmark, is called Ding Dong, Thatcher’s Gone, and boasts on the cover that it contains ‘everything you need to celebrate the big day’.

'Grotesque and obscene': Party packs for celebrating the death of Margaret Thatcher were condemned yesterday

This includes ‘specially themed balloons, party whistles, indoor firework party poppers and special invitation cards to give to your friends, all in a collectable cardboard box’.

Another stall was selling T-shirts rejoicing at the prospect of Lady Thatcher’s death. One design features a white cross on a grave with ‘Thatcher’ across it, and the words: ‘A generation of trade unionists will dance on her grave.’

Another has an image of Mrs Thatcher’s Spitting Image puppet, along with the words, ‘Hey ho the witch is dead’. A notice nearby said: ‘In the event of Thatcher’s death open bag and wear T-shirt immediately.’

The T-shirts were sold by the Derbyshire Unemployed Workers’ Centre, an organisation that provides ‘welfare rights advice services’.

Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell said: ‘This shows the nasty side of politics. These packs are grotesque and obscene. Is this what the British Left have become? It shows how ethically bankrupt the socialist movement is if it thinks this is acceptable.’

MPs' condemnation: Tory MP Priti Patel, left, is 'appalled' by the attack on someone who has 'successfully fought for jobs and...economic prosperity' while Ed Miliband believes it is 'totally inappropriate' according to a Labour source

Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘I am appalled. This is typical of the TUC, attacking those who have successfully fought for jobs and the creation of economic prosperity in Great Britain.’

Ed Miliband condemned the packs and T-shirts. A Labour source said: ‘Ed Miliband thinks they are totally inappropriate and should not be on sale.

He does not believe anybody should celebrate when Lady Thatcher dies.’An embarrassed Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, said the T-shirts were ‘tasteless and totally inappropriate’.

Last night Colin Hampton, who was selling the T-shirts on his stall, said he was removing then from sale after a request from the TUC.
