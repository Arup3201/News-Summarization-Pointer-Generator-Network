A restaurant and bar chain will stop serving their ‘Albino Rhino’ beer after an albino woman complained that the craft beer’s name and a human rights tribunal deemed it offensive.

Earls Kitchen and Bar will scrap the name of the 25-year-old brand, named after the rare white rhinoceros, because a woman with albinism from Vancouver, Canada filed a complaint to the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal last year.

She also complained about the company’s ‘Albino Rhino Wednesdays’.

Offensive: Restaurant chain Earls Kitchen and Bar will stop serving their 'Albino Rhino' beer after an albino woman complained that the craft beer's name and a human rights tribunal deemed it offensive

A group representing people with the genetic condition which causes a lack of pigmentation in skin, hair and eyes, accused the business of discrimination based on physical disability and colour.

The chain, who says they do not agree with the complaint, will continue the line of beer but under just the name ‘Rhino’ from April 24.

They intend to remove the word albino from all their products and marketing in response to the complaint.

No intention to offend: Earls said they did not agree with the complaint about the name of their 25-year-old brand but they will scrap the name and replace it with just 'Rhino' beer

In a statement, the chain with restaurants in America and Canada, said: ‘It did not occur to us that the name 
would be associated with albinism, neither did it occur to us it would 
offend.

‘We do not believe the use of the word “albino” reflects any intention to discriminate against persons with albinism.

‘We have learned from participating in 
the human rights complaint process, however, that many persons with 
albinism are genuinely offended and feel that their dignity is 
negatively impacted by the use of the word “albino” in our marketing.’

Earls spokeswoman Cate Simpson said, according to Metro News: ‘We feel this is a positive thing, a great time to refresh our iconic craft beer brand.’

The complaint generated much debate about political correctness online.

CEO of Under The Same Sun, an 
advocacy group for those with albinism, Peter Ash said: ‘It would be 
like saying, let’s put in some Alzheimer appetizers, Down syndrome 
daiquiris or cerebral palsy cocktails. That would offend anyone’s 
sensibilities.’

Mr Ash said the group was very happy with the tribunal’s decision.

Earls
Restaurants said: ‘Albinism is a very rare condition and like many 
Canadians we knew very little about the condition or the very real 
discrimination persons with albinism experience, both in Canada and 
around the world.  

‘Persons with albinism are a stigmatized group that face prejudice and exclusion in many areas of Canadian society.’

Approximately one in 17,000 people have one of the types of albinism.
