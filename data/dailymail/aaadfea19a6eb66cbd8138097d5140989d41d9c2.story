A massive sinkhole has opened up just yards from the fence of a prison - but officials insist there is no chance of any inmates escaping.

The hole first appeared just outside the walls of HMP The Mount in Bovingdon, Hertforshire in January.

Staff at the 770-capacity prison filled the sinkhole with soil and concrete - but it re-emerged and is now believed to be about 6ft wide and 15ft deep.

A massive sinkhole has opened up close to the fence of HMP The Mount Prison - but officials insist there is no chance of any inmates escaping

A 15ft sinkhole has emerged yards from the walls of HMP The Mount Prison in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire

The Mount, operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, opened as a young offenders institution in 1987 on the site of a former RAF station

It was immediately fenced off but officials at the category C jail have refused to confirm the exact size and depth.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We are aware of an issue regarding the land next to HMP The Mount and are working to resolve it.

'There is no risk to members of the public, prisoners or prison staff as the area has been fenced off and is on private property with no public access.

'We are still in discussions with the Homes and Communities Agency regarding future options for the surplus land.

'The Ministry of Justice is required to dispose of any surplus property as quickly as possible while ensuring we get the best value for taxpayers' money.'

Local resident Ross Butcher, 32, said: 'All of us had a right laugh about it at the beginning and kept comparing it to the Shawshank Redemption or something.

'I still haven't ruled out the possibility that some prisoners will just pop out of it. It's only a couple hundred yards from the prison fence.

'There is some concern that more could appear as that land has already been earmarked for a housing development.'

The hole comes after a similar crater opened up in nearby Hemel Hempstead, Hertforshire, last February.

It is believed to have been caused by former chalk mines beneath the surface of the ground being exacerbated by the previous winter's heavy rain.

The Mount, operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, opened as a young offenders institution in 1987 on the site of a former RAF station.

Over the years it changed into a prison for adult males. It is classed as category C meaning it is a closed prison for inmates 'who cannot be trusted in open conditions but who are unlikely to try to escape'.
