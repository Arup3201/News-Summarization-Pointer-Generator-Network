Suspect: Justin DeRyke, 22, was arrested after the body of his niece, Willow Long, was found near a river bed in Watson, Illinois

The uncle of a seven-year-old girl has been charged with murder after her body was found in a river bed near her home.

Justin DeRyke, 22, was taken into custody after the authorities discovered the body of Willow Long, who was reported missing on Sunday.

A spokesman for The Effingham State's Attorney Office said all the indications suggested the death was homicide.

But the girl’s grandfather, Dale DeRyke, who is also the father of the alleged killer, said his son panicked after what he claimed was an accident.

Dale DeRyke told Fox2Now Justin was babysitting the little girl on Saturday night. 

He said the two were playing when Willow ran outside, where a pile of sticks was scattered over the floor.

'A stick went through her and through her head,' he said.

'She was laying there twitching and dying.'

Mr DeRyke Snr then claims his son got scared and hid the body.

Now he says his son has 'nothing but remorse,' for what he has done.

Authorities would not comment on DeRyke’s statement.

Spokesman Bryan Kibler, said: 'All indications are that the death is a homicide.

'The Effingham County State’s Attorney’s office will file First Degree Murder charges against the defendant on Wednesday afternoon in Effingham County Circuit Court, pending the possibility of additional charges to be filed later.'

Tearful friends and neighbors marched down the quiet Watson, Illinois street adjacent to the little girl's house, carrying stuffed animals and balloons in memory of her on Tuesday afternoon.

They were placed outside the DeRyke home, which was still a crime scene two hours earlier.

A 10-year-old girl and friend of Willow, Ashlee Erikson, said: 'She was a nice kind bright little girl and she was my best friend. 

'She was gone too soon.'

Her mother, Dawn Erikson was also overcome with emotion.

She said: 'We moved away from the big city to get away from this. 

'And to have it happen here is ridiculous. And to find out it was her own family? 

'These are gifts from God.'
