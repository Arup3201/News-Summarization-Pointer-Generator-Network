A vet who allegedly dismembered his wife after she died in a botched DIY liposuction and sent her body parts for incineration disguised as a big dog has been arrested.

The 45-year-old Argentine runs a vet’s surgery popular with British expats in Benijofar near Alicante, Spain.

The firm licensed to incinerate animals has told police they did not make any checks on the remains because the vet was a regular customer. 

The vet was arrested in the town of Benijorfar, near Alicante, Spain

A sign was put up in English at the vet’s, called Pet Care, yesterday, which said: ‘Closed until further notice due to bereavement.’

Civil Guards are said to have launched an investigation after the vet turned up a police station with his wife’s ashes in an urn.

A source said: ‘A liposuction appears to have taken place but we are still trying to get to the bottom of whether it was the cause of her death and whether she died by accident or design.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
