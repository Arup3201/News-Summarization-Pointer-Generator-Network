Police in Mexico have discovered almost 50 kilos of cannabis stuffed into a shipment of sombreros heading for Chicago.

Around 100 packets of the illegal drug were found rolled into coils and hidden in the crowns of the hats during a raid on a courier warehouse.

Officers had received an anonymous tip-off which led them to couriers in the city of Tlaquepaque, in the western Mexican State of Jalisco, where they found the packages ready for shipping.

The drug traffickers had also packed coffee grounds and cinnamon with the drugs to disguise the smell  so they would not be detected by sniffer dogs.

But border guards searching the warehouse noticed that the sombreros seemed to be unusually heavy and quickly discovered the  hats' hidden surprise.

Now Mexican and US police agencies are investigating to discover the sender and recipient of the drugs.  

A spokesman for Mexico's Agency of Criminal Investigation said: 'There were four large boxes which were used to hide 100 packages of cannabis all of which have now been seized and will be destroyed.

'At this stage we are still investigating how long this has been going on and looking to see where else the sombreros have been sent. We managed to seize a lot of addresses and these are now being checked out.'
