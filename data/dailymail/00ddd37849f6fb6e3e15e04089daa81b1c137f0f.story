A disabled Lottery winner says he wishes he had never won his £20,000 prize after his new-found wealth meant his benefits were cancelled.

George Grant, 54, hoped go on a luxury holiday in Nashville, Tennessee after winning the five-figure sum on a National Lottery Lucky Dip ticket.

But he says he is instead counting the cost after the windfall meant he no longer qualifies for income support, housing benefit, a council tax reduction or any other means-tested handouts.

George Grant  wishes he had never won £20,000 on the lottery after some of his benefits were cancelled

Mr Grant, of Golspie in northern Scotland, is now deemed to have savings over the government's £16,000 limit and can only make what benefit bosses describe as 'reasonable expenditure'.

He said: 'I wish I'd never won this money, the hassle it has caused me. I won't be buying a ticket again.'

Mr Grant has been unable to work since he was left with mobility problems following a motorbike accident in October 1980, when he was just 21.

He had previously earned a living as a youth leader and disc jockey but since the accident has been forced to live on benefits.

He receives disability living allowance (DLA) as well as housing benefit and council tax benefit.

Mr Grant said: 'That accident stopped everything in its tracks. I've been buying tickets since the lottery started in 1994 and have won £10 here and there but nothing major until now.'

He purchased a Lucky Dip ticket from the Nisa store on Golspie's Main Street earlier this month and went back on Saturday to find out if he'd won anything.

He said: 'I went into the shop and handed the ticket over. The machine made a funny noise and I thought it was another £10 win but the sales assistant said "I think you've won a wee bit more than £10".

'When he said that, I looked out the window for the pink elephants to fly.'

Benefits rules mean that claimants cannot spend any windfall in order to become entitled to handouts again

It turned out that he had won £20,000 on the raffle, run as part of the Lucky Dip game. The Nisa store was unable to pay out the winnings and George had to go to another store where he was given a cheque.

His immediate thoughts were that he would pay off debts he owes to relatives and possibly visit Nashville, a place he has always wanted to visit because of his love of music.

Government rules state that anyone with savings over £16,000 is not entitled to means-tested benefits such as income support, housing benefit and council tax reduction.

However, they can still receive benefits which are not means-tested, such as disability living allowance and incapacity benefit.

A complicated formula is in place to calculate benefit entitlement for people with savings of between £6000 and £16,000, while anyone with savings under £6000 can receive benefits, if eligible.

There are also rules in place to prevent anyone, such as Mr Grant, who comes into an inheritance or windfall, from spending it in order to  retain means-tested benefit.

He has already been told that he will have to account for any expenditures he makes.

He said: 'I thought how great it was to finally have some money and be debt-free.

'I've always wanted to go to Nashville. I've never been abroad and have only flown once and that was off the back of a motorbike.

'The furthest I've travelled has been to London. I was never meant to have any money.'

Richard Gale, from Mr Grant's local Citizens' Advice Bureau (CAB) manager, said: 'This is a great win for George.

'The information that I have is that it is all a matter of what is considered to be "reasonable expenditure" and that requires a discussion between the benefit providers and the claimant.

'In this case that would be George, and the CAB would be happy to work with him, should he wish, to ensure that he complies with the benefit regulations and does not fall foul of any sanctions that may result from his windfall and to help him achieve his goals.'
