Facebook is in 'advanced talks' to buy satnav software firm Waze - but could be outbid by Apple at the last minute, it has been claimed.

The social network is believed to be in advanced talks to acquire Israeli mobile satellite navigation start-up Waze for $800 million to $1 billion.

However, experts say Apple is also interested in using the software to bolster its Maps app - and could step in with a last minute bid.

Waze uses satellite signals from members' smartphones to 'crowdsource' maps and traffic data, and can run on Apple or Android handsets and tablets

Waze uses satellite signals from members' smartphones to generate maps 
and traffic data, which it then shares with other users, offering 
real-time traffic info.

Due diligence on a deal is already underway, Israeli business blog Calcalist said, claiming that talks began six months ago.

Officials at Waze declined to comment on the report.

The Facebook overture is more serious than the Apple one, it has been claimed.

'You could term the interaction between Waze and Apple as a series of ‘dates,’ whereas this seems more like an ‘engagement.’

'The deal makes a lot of sense for Facebook, and of course Waze would be getting a lot more money,” according to a ZDNet source.

The Waze software shows other users nearby as it guides users, who can also report problems which are shared with all users

Waze and Facebook partnered in October 2012 when Waze released its updated version that allows users to share their drive with their Facebook friends.

If it goes ahead, the deal  would be Facebook's third acquisition in Israel.

It bought photo sharing app Snaptu in 2011 for $70 million and facial recognition firm  Face.com in 2012 for $60 million.

In the last year, Waze tripled its user base to 45 million and in March alone, 1.5 million users downloaded the free mobile navigation app, Calcalist said.
