It's not exactly a room with a view - but this hotel in Singapore could be many travellers' answer to a good night's sleep.

Forget 20 bed dormitories and drunk, loud crowds, The Pod capsule hotel 'fills the gap' between budget and conventional full-service hotel. 

Each cosy capsule - starting at £40 for a single - adds a touch of luxury with 300 thread-count sateen cotton sheets and pull-down blinds, while guests also enjoy complimentary dry-cleaning and laundry, buffet breakfast, use of business centres and high-speed Wi-Fi connection.

Minimalist: Director of The Pod, Alan Tay said: 'The hotel has 83 modules inspired by modern and minimalist living'

Located at the fringe of the Singapore Central Business District, Singapore's latest boutique capsule hotel opened last week and merely two days after its launch, the hotel hit an occupancy rate of 85 per cent on August 9, a public holiday in Singapore.

Director of The Pod, Alan Tay said: 'The hotel has 83 modules inspired by modern and minimalist living, providing guests the best of both worlds by offering them the premium amenities, services, look, and feel of a boutique hotel, along with the communal and affordable nature of a hostel.'

The emphasis on design and privacy is extended into the washrooms and vanity area.
