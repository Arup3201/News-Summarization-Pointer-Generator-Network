The Mormon Utah doctor convicted of murdering his wife by drowning her in a bathtub is due back in court to answer to sexual abuse charges brought against him by his daughter.

Martin MacNeill, 57, was found guilty last Saturday of drugging and killing his wife, Michele, six years ago. 

He faces 15 years to life for first-degree murder when he is sentenced on January 7. He also was found guilty of obstruction of justice, which could add one to 15 years.

In the course of the high-profile trial, MacNeill's daughters Alexis and Rachel testified against the father of eight and were relieved when the jury found him guilty.

Alexis Somers, 30, who was the prosecution’s star witness, has accused the 57-year-old former physician of molesting her in the months after her mother's slaying.

MailOnline usually does not name victims of possible sexual abuse, but Miss Somers has publicly addressed the allegations against her father.

MacNeill has been charged with second-degree forcible sex abuse and third-degree tempering with a witness, Desert News reported.

Oral arguments on a motion to continue will be presented in a Provo court Monday, followed by a two-day jury trial that will begin December 3.

MacNeill's attorney Randall Spencer, who represented him in the murder trial, will also handle the defense in the sex abuse case.

Prosecutor David Sturgill said he is willing to negotiate a plea deal with MacNeill in the case.

In September 2007, then-24-year-old Alexis Somers filed a police report claiming that her father had abused her on two occasions in the three months after her mother's death.

According to the charging documents, in May 2007, Alexis was asleep in her parents' bed when she was awakened by her father fondling her and kissing her hand. He was supposed to be sleeping on the couch.

Alexis demanded to know what her father was doing, to which he allegedly replied, 'I'm sorry, I thought you were your mother.'

A similar incident reportedly took place two months later while the family were vacationing in California.

In a recorded phone conversation, MacNeill allegedly told Alexis that he 'was asleep' when he assaulted her.

When confronted with allegations of sex abuse while being questioned by police, MacNeill stated that a person cannot be held accountable for his actions while he's asleep, according to court documents.

Bed-mate: During the trial, MacNeill's daughter Sabrina testified that their 'nanny' Gypsy Willis spent every night in the doctor's bedroom after their mother's death

According to a police report, the Mormon doctor told his daughters that 'even though his wife is dead, he is still a sexual person and has desires that need to be met.' 

Alexis Somers and her sisters had spent years dogging the authorities to open a murder investigation, and were instrumental in bringing their father to account for their mother's slaying. 

The young women claimed that the seemingly respectable doctor and a former bishop in his local congregation of 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was, in fact, a monster and philandered who led a double life and killed his wife so he could be with his mistress, Gypsy Willis.

It wasn't until MacNeill's release in July 2012 from a federal prison in Texas on charges of fraud that Utah prosecutors moved to file charges of murder and obstruction of justice.

During the trial, MacNeill's daughter Sabrina testified that Willis, who was hired as their nanny, spent every night in the doctor's bedroom after their mother's death.

MacNeill is now planning to appeal his murder conviction, but it will not be handled by Spencer since the disgraced 57-year-old medic has no money to pay attorney's fees.
