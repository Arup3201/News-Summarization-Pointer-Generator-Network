The Arlington, Virgina parking garage where 'Deep Throat' famously leaked information, which blew open the Watergate scandal to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward is about to be demolished.

Property group Monday Properties plans to tear down the two aging office buildings, at 1401 Wilson Blvd and 1400 Key Blvd in the Rosslyn neighborhood, that sit above the garage that played a pivotal role in ending Richard Nixon's presidency in 1974.

The demolition will make way for a new mixed use development, with a 32-story apartment or condo building and a 29-story office building.

But before any construction can take place the proposed redevelopment will go through Arlington's site plan process, which generally takes 1-4 years.

Forty years ago, Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward met a source, dubbed by the newspaper's managing editor as 'Deep Throat' and later revealed to be FBI official Mark Felt, in the humble garage.

The underground parking lot was chosen because Felt, who was nicknamed because he was on 'deep background,' considered it an 'anonymous secure location.' They met there six times between October 1972 and November 1973.

The information Felt passed on to Woodward helped expose the Watergate scandal, which ultimately saw President Nixon become the first ever United States president to resign.

Woodward and his colleague Carl 
Bernstein wrote a book about the scandal two years later called All The 
President's Men, which was later turned into a film starring Robert 
Redford and Dustin Hoffman.

A
permanent historical marker was erected outside the garage by Arlington
County to mark the location and the marker is expected to stay after 
the garage is gone.

'We
obviously view the whole Watergate situation as a significant event in 
the history of our country,' the company's chief development officer, 
Tim Helmig, told Arlnow.com. 'It would be our hope that we preserve that plaque and incorporate it in our redevelopment.'

He
added that the garage, which was built in the early 1960s, was nearing 
the end of its useful life and said his company was open to ideas about 
how to preserve some part of the garage's history.

'That will likely come into the discussion as part of the (site plan) process,' he said. 'That's exactly what the process is designed for.'

The marker will likely be removed and stored during the redevelopment.

Some were upset that the historical place will be torn down.

The garage is somewhat of a mecca for many working journalists, who believe it is the physical embodiment of how important investigative reporting can be.

Local, Michelle Bloom, wrote on Twitter: 'We're always tearing down historic places... This is why we're not Europe.'

The
new buildings will have 500,000 square feet of office space, 385,000 
square feet of residential space, and 60,000 square feet of retail 
space, according to Arlnow.com.

It will contain a grocery store and about half of the land will be used as a public open space, Helmig said.

It's not yet clear when the proposed demolition and subsequent construction would take place.

'There's
not really a set time frame,' Helmig said. 'We are really in the early 
stages. We have a lot of process and community input to go before our 
project comes to fruition.'

Arlington County's Site Plan Review Committee is set to hold a meeting about the development proposal on October 21.
