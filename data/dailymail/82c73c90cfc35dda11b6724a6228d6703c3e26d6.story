Trendsetter: The Queen carries her Launer bag as she opens the Royal London Hospital building this year

Move over, Kate. There’s a new fashion queen in the Windsor family.

Her identity? Well … the clue is in the title.

Sales of Launer handbags, the Queen’s favourite brand, have risen by 52 per cent in the last year.

The
 firm says the increase is down to her recent willingness to experiment 
with different styles and colours of her trademark boxy bag.

The
 sales boom echoes the so-called ‘Kate effect’ – anything the Duchess of
 Cambridge is seen wearing usually flies off the shelves in minutes.

Launer’s
 owner Gerald Bodmer said: ‘What is lovely is that people are thinking 
of her as a fashion icon rather than an elderly person. The fact is that
 she does carry stuff that other people want.’

Although the Queen usually opts for a simple black patent model, in the last year she has chosen a variety of different colours.

It is these colourful designs which have proved hugely popular with customers.

Mr
 Bodmer told The Sunday Times: ‘We are very lucky. She is really loyal 
to us and loyal to British merchandise.

'I get a colossal buzz every time
 we see a picture of the Queen with one of our handbags. We couldn’t 
have a better advert. It’s wonderful.

‘She is partly the reason we’re still here. Having a Royal Warrant makes a big difference to a firm like us.’

The Queen owns around 40 Launer bags, which she has used since the 1960s.

Her bespoke bags always come with a mirror, a matching purse and a glasses case.

Her handbags have a slightly longer handle so they don’t get caught up in her clothes when she is greeting people.

She is also said to dislike shoulder straps, zips and partitions.

A Launer handbag costs between £435 and £6,000.

In June, Launer revealed that the Queen uses her handbag to signal to her ladies-in-waiting when she wants to leave a function.

Mr Bodmer said she placed the bag on the table to provide them with a five-minute warning.

The Queen’s bespoke bags always come with a mirror, a matching purse and a glasses case, he said.
