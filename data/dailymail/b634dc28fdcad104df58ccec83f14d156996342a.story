A teenager who was 'out of control' on mephedrone set off a makeshift nail bomb in a railway carriage and stole lethal potassium cyanide to build another device.

Stuart Lee, 19, could have caused serious harm, said a judge at Gloucester Crown Court today as he jailed the youngster for five and a half years.

'As it happens no-one was hurt,' Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Lee.

'But had you had time to mix up the substances you had stolen there was potential for a very unpleasant explosion and the release of some very unpleasant gases including gases containing cyanide.'

Jailed: Both Stuart Lee, left, 19, of Pillowell, near Lydney, Gloucestershire, and Dexter Cunnington, right, 27, of Tutshill Rise, Lydney, were 'out of control' on mephedrone at the time of their offences, a judge said

Lee, of Pillowell, near Lydney, Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty to arson, possession of explosive materials, burglary and theft of hydrochloric acid and potassium cyanide.

He also pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and attempting to pervert the course of justice over an attack on a 16-year-old mephedrone dealer, who was left in a coma for two and a half weeks and now faces health lasting problems.

Judge Tabor sentenced Lee to two years in a young offenders institute for the explosives offences, three years for the attempted robbery and six months for perverting justice.

He passed concurrent sentences for all the other offences Lee admitted, making his total term five and a half years.

Cuffed: Lee was sentenced to five and a half 
years after admitting a string of offences including an attack which 
left a teenage drug dealer in a coma

Also in the dock was Dexter 
Cunnington, 27, of Tutshill Rise, Lydney, who pleaded guilty to the 
attempted robbery and perverting justice offences which he committed 
jointly with Lee.

He was jailed for four and a half years.

Judge Tabor said it was clear that both defendants were at the time of the offences last year ‘out of control’ because of their use of mephedrone.

Their cases showed clearly that the use of mephedrone, a former 'legal high' banned in 2010 and which is rife in Gloucestershire, is not harmess as many users think, said the judge.

Julian Kesner, prosecuting, said Lee’s first crime was theft of £100 worth of aftershave from Boot’s on 29th June last year, Police bailed him and he went on to make a nail bomb the following month.

He put the device in a railway carriage in a siding at Lydney station and set it alight on a disposable barbecue.

Pictures on his mobile phone showed how he had laid out nails, screws and snooker balls to make the device. He used masking tape to stick them to an aerosol can.

Mr Kesner told the court that on September 11 last year Lee researched potassium cyanide and hydrochloric acid and then went on to burgle the Whitecroft Essentials factory in Lydney.

He took flour and a knife from one department and then - with the help of a 14-year-old boy - containers of hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and potassium cyanide from another.

He boasted to the boy, whom he paid £10 for his assistance, that one spoonful of the powder would kill 5-6 people.

The containers of acid they took contained 30 litres each and needed the pair of them to carry them, Mr Kesner said.

The next day police raided the 14-year-old boy’s house - where Lee had left the chemicals - and he was arrested.

A Portdon Down scientist found that, mixed in a paint tin, the pressure of the acid and cyanide would have caused a forceful blast, said Mr Kesner.

It would also have released poisonous hydrogen cyanide gas, the expert witness concluded.

Dangerous drug: The cases of Lee and Cunnington 
showed clearly that the use of mephedrone, a former 'legal high' banned 
in 2010, which is rife in Gloucestershire, is not harmess as many users 
think, said the judge

The attempted robbery committed by Cunnington and Lee was on a 16-year-old boy who was selling mephedrone in Lydney, Mr Kesner told the court.

Mephedrone became popular among youngsters several years ago as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets.

Chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa, it is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy and the energising qualities of amphetamines, but with the short-lived hit of a line of cocaine.

The Talk To Frank drugs awareness service warns that it can also induce feelings of paranoia and anxiety, and overstimulate the nervous system leading to fits.

For a while easily available through web sites sourcing it from Chinese laboratories, the substance was finally banned in 2010 after it was linked to a string of deaths.

The boy was lured to Church Road, Lydney, by a 14-year-old girl he was seeing at the time who was working with Lee and Cunnington.

There he was waylaid by the pair. Cunnington hit him repeatedly on the head and he suffered two skull fractures and was in a coma in hospital for two and a half weeks.

Mr Kesner said he had been left with damage to his sense of smell and hearing. He also has difficulty with recall and verbal fluency as a result of his injuries.

Fiona Elder, for Lee, said he has been in custody on remand for almost a year and is now free of drugs and determined not to go back on them.

Lee was a young man who had done badly at school except for science and he had since ‘expanded that interest in an illegal way and he now recognises a potentially dangerous way,’ she said.

For Cunnington, Nicola Colwill said he too had been abusing mephedrone and mixing with teenagers instead of facing up to his adult responsibilities - he has a partner and two children.
