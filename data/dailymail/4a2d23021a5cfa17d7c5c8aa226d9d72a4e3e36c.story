Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's personal trainer has shared the health secrets behind her enviable physique - and how you can get it in a few simple steps

His internationally renowned Clean & 
Lean diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans, from supermodels Elle Macpherson and
 David Gandy, to actor Hugh Grant and Victoria's Secret models.

FEMAIL caught up with the training guru to get his top tips for emulating his clients' lifestyles - and bodies - in 2015.

His top tip? 'Stress less,' he says. 'Try to make some time for yourself. Book in for a massage or go to a yoga class to lower your cortisol levels and make you happier and leaner.'

James also swears by the power of coconut and thinks we should all be eating more.

He explains: 'Coconut fat is good for you in so many ways. For example it helps with your digestion and boosts your immune system. 

'It can also help you to lose fat if eaten in moderation, since it boosts your metabolism.'

Rosie's trainer, James Duigan, shares his most essential wellbeing tip as 'stress less'. He explains: 'Try to make some time for yourself to lower your cortisol levels and make you happier and leaner'

James recommends eating coconut yoghurt CO YO as an 'easy and delicious way to get your daily coconut intake'. 

He also advises his clients to add a teaspoon of coconut oil to their coffee instead of low fat milk - as long as it's organic.

We've all heard about the power of kale and James says the nutritional powerhouse is going nowhere in 2015.

'Eat a handful of kale and spinach (at least) every day,' he advises.

'Blend it, steam it, have it raw - there are no excuses not to have these amazing foods in your life daily. Trust me, you'll notice the difference.' 

His final two tips for living like Rosie are simple and won't cost a penny.

James Duigan's Clean & Lean plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up

'Breathe. It sounds obvious but breathing is often something we do without thinking,' says James.

'If you can practise the right breathing technique, it will help you to perform your exercises better and it will also help you to feel more energised and happy.

'And finally, drink more water. Drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up helps rid the body of unwanted toxins from the blood, which helps to keep your skin clear and glowing.

Huntington-Whiteley
 met James several years ago and is such a fan that she wrote the 
introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What
 I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating
 a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I
 ever thought possible. Oh, and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as 
flat as James can!'

The 
diet has never been advertised, but those who follow it - along with 
Duigan's workouts, which he teaches from his London gym Bodyism and were recently voted as best in the business by Tatler - become enthusiastic to the point of
 fanaticism, making the Clean & Lean plan popular through word of 
mouth alone.

It recommends fresh food, as close to 
its natural state as possible. No refined sugar, which Duigan describes as like a 'toxic fat
 bomb' for your waistline.

Cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the
 morning. Rely on 
natural, nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a roller coaster
 of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end 
in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant, whether 
that be coffee, carbs, sweets or wine.

And yes, ditch the booze.

Britain's most beautiful citizens, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, left, has been following the kale, coconut and water-packed Clean & Lean plan for some years now, along with model David Gandy is also a fan

In
 his book, Duigan explains that he came up with the term 'clean and 
lean' to describe the 'ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body.

'The word "clean" here means a body that can deal effectively with 
toxins - one that can deal with a few that sneak in (via a glass of wine 
or a chocolate bar) and flush them out successfully,' he says. 

In
 his years of studying nutrition, says Duigan, he has discovered that 
while you can live off processed low-fat food and diet colas for a while
 your body will be so toxic that you'll find it hard to keep the weight 
off.

'People come to me
 who have tried every single diet out there, yet they can't stay slim 
for long.

'They cut carbs, they count calories, they ban whole food 
groups and they spend their lives weighing and measuring out food,' he 
says.

'But this type of 
dieting is a complete waste of time: it might help you to drop a dress 
size or tighten your belt for a while, but you'll gain it back 
eventually because your body will still be toxic and it's unsustainable. Who wants to live like this?

'And so the cycle of dieting, feeling 
miserable and deprived, losing and gaining weight continues.'

Instead,
 Duigan says we should enjoy our food but make sure that rather than 
processed foods, we eat healthy, natural food and avoid ones laden with
 sugar.

Clean foods are those that:

It's not just the wrong type of food that piles on the pounds. The relentless, low-level stress of everyday life can also add inches to your waist.

When we're frightened, angry, tense or worried our bodies become flooded with adrenalin and a stress hormone called cortisol.

The adrenalin keeps us alert and focused, while the cortisol prepares our muscles for a 'fight-or-flight' response.

James Duigan says stress can lead to tummy fat 

It also helps the body to release sugar into the bloodstream for instant energy.

It's all part of a defence mechanism that allows the body to respond appropriately when faced with danger.

While this stress mechanism worked well for us when we were cavemen, modern-day stress, caused by a relentlessly busy lifestyle, is really bad for you.

It makes you fat, it wears out your immune system and it increases your risk of serious illness. This is because many of the situations that cause stress nowadays don't present the sort of physical danger that you need to run away from.

The result is that fat-storing hormones - and the sugar they help to release into the bloodstream - float around your system, eventually ending up as fat on your tummy and around your waist.

They also make you crave more sugar because your body thinks it needs more to keep going.

As stress levels subside, your adrenalin levels fall, but cortisol (and the resulting blood sugar) stays in the system much longer.

Research shows that fat cells around the stomach attract cortisol, giving you a layer of toxic fat just below your abdominal muscles that's really hard to shift, so doing regular sit-ups is pointless if you always feel stressed.

And stomach fat is the most dangerous type because it raises your risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain cancers.

Constant stress also shuts down the digestive system because your body redirects blood from there to your muscles.

So stress can leave you constipated, bloated and toxic. Beating stress is the only way to better health and a better body.
