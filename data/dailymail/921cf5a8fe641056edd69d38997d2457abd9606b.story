Apparently it's not just the weight of the evidence against a defendant that matters at trial.

Male jurors are 'significantly more likely' to convict an obese woman than a slender one when both females are accused of the very same crime, according to a new study by Yale researchers.

Fat bias: Yale researchers asked 471 mock jurors to evaluate photographs of slender - as well as obese - defendants in arriving at their shocking findings

In order to arrive at the findings, the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity team presented 471 mock jurors the details of a hypothetical case of check fraud, along with images of four fake defendants - two men and two women.

One photograph depicted a portly man; one a slender man; a third a svelte woman, and a fourth a larger female.

The mock jurors then rated the pretend defendants' guilt on a five-point scale, given their appearances.

And not only did male jurors generally rate the guilt of the fatter woman higher than that of the slender woman, the bias was greater if it was a thin man who was deciding their fate.

Twelve biased men: Like the iconic movie that long-ago explored a jury's bias based on a defendant's race, the Yale survey explored another kind of prejudice

Male participants with trim waistlines were, the study found, more likely to label fat women 'repeat offenders' with 'awareness' of their crimes than the slender defendants.

“According to research ...the 
prevalence of weight-based stigmatization is now on par with rates of 
racial discrimination,” Natasha 
Schvey, lead author of the study, reportedly said. “The present study identifies yet another setting in which obese persons are vulnerable to bias and discrimination.”

Interestingly, the male jurors' bias did not apply to the hypothetical fat male check fraudster. 

How does the jury find: The study found the bias against obese women was more pronounced among men with trim waistlines

On that point, the study, which was published online in the International Journal of Obesity, discovered no concrete disparity between how guilty the jurors thought the portly man was versus his slender, male counterpart.

As for the women who participated, researchers also found no evidence the size of the person in question mattered when they made their decision about their guilt.

The study, a copy of which was obtained by The Mail, takes a stab at why the findings were so.

'Obese individuals are vulnerable to negative societal attitudes, stigma and prejudice in multiple domains,' the study read. 'Driving such discrimination and bias are stereotypes that depict overweight individuals as greedy, lazy, unmotivated and lacking in self discipline and will power.'
