He would never have got a white Christmas here.

But with a pool, spa, home movie theater, retractable glass walls, and acres of land, acclaimed singer Bing Crosby can't have minded too much.

His 7,000-square-foot ranch in Rancho Mirage, California, was a go-to party house for the elite of the 1950s - and allegedly played host to a liaison between JFK and Marilyn Monroe.

Incredible: The mountains in Rancho Mirage, California, tower over this sprawling bungalow that was home to Bing Crosby and is now on the market for $5 million

Spell-binding: The idyllic ranch will not have seen a white Christmas but the regal, pillared building and luscious green land will have been a pretty enough picture

Master suite: Complete with a fireplace, desk, three armchairs, and floor-to-ceiling windows, this 1,400-square-foot bedroom is more like a luxurious lounge area

Grandeur: The living room has concrete-slabbed flooring and exposed brick, with retractable glass walls that open out to the swimming pool overlooking the valley

Decades later, it masqueraded as a holiday home for the Obamas one summer, sparking rumors the first couple wanted to buy the sprawling property.

Now, it could be yours... for a cool $5 million.

The gated home, built in the 1950s for Academy Award-winning Crosby, boasts a 1,400-square-foot master bedroom, two guest rooms, and a two-bed casita attached, with its own kitchen and private entrance.

The bespoke kitchen, equipped for professional chefs, is reached via hand-craft Moroccan doors.

Secret hideaway? President John F Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe are said to have had a secret liaison in the home potentially during one of the glitzy parties thrown there

Character: Bing Crosby had the home specifically designed to cater for his taste in Moroccan wood design, like this bespoke door that shrouds one of three bedrooms

State-of-the-art: The kitchen has been fitted with the latest technology ideal for a professional chef - or to make amateur cooking feel that bit more sophisticated

Long day? Would-be buyers can look forward to kicking back in the turbo-powered Jacuzzi that looks out onto an annexed garden with stone walls

The silver screen: Bing Crosby fans will delight in the film posters featuring the home's previous owner in this home movie theater that could seat around 10 people

Guest room: Guests not only have a sizable room and bed but they also get an entire living space with a table and seating for four of their own guests

Any more for any more? If the previous bedrooms weren't enough, there's also a casita attached to the building with two further rooms and its own kitchen space

Hand-made: These Moroccan doors were hand-carved for the property near Palm Springs and Coachella Valley, where presidents have played golf for years

In the bathroom-cum-spa, the future owner can look forward to dips in the turbo-powered Jacuzzi. 

The living area has a wet bar that no-doubt will have come in handy at Crosby's soirees. 

Walk through sliding glass doors to the outdoor pool and you are met with a panoramic view of the Coachella Valley.

Would-be buyers who feel that's not enough will be relieved to hear there is a parcel of land next door that comes with the property for 'extra privacy' or 'future expansion'.

This living room and kitchen of the adjacent casita, with a Marilyn Monroe poster on the wall, could be where JFK and Marilyn were said to have engaged in their liaison

Bathroom: The glass-walled shower comes with a stall inside, and the sinks are marble-topped

And for any die-hard Bing Crosby fans looking to follow in his footsteps, the walls are currently decked out in photos and posters of the crooner.

On sale with Sotheby's International, it is slated to garner a flurry of attention despite fears of uncertainty in the property market.

It was last put on the market for $3.5 million - 43 per cent lower than its going rate today - but after a recent surge in neighbor's house prices, the current owner had a re-think.
