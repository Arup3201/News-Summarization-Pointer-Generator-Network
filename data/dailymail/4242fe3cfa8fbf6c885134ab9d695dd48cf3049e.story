When you've got a body like Amy Childs, you may as well flaunt it, which is exactly what the reality TV star from Essex is doing in her latest photoshoot.

The 23-year-old has just unveiled her new summer beachwear collection and proudly showcases it in her latest campaign imagery.

Bright and bold, Amy's latest range of kimonos and kaftans promises to take the wearer from pool to party effortlessly.

'If you think a kaftan can only be worn as a beach cover-up, then you are very wrong. Teamed with some white skinnies, killer heels, and statement jewellery, you will look glamorous and gorgeous wherever you strut,' Amy said of her designs.

The beautician from Romford explains that she was inspired by the characters Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte from Sex And The City with these boho-esque numbers.

‘I love summer! It’s the best time of year to have fun with colours and get the best from your figure.

'Jumpers and chunky scarfs sometimes just don’t do it for me; these kaftans keep you confident and cool in the gorgeous heat of summer,' she added.

Meanwhile,
 the TV-personality-turned-fashion-designer has been busy launching her 
new 30-piece fashion range at high street store Dorothy Perkins.

The collection was rolled out in flagship stores in April and is being introduced at other branches this month.

She has also teased her fans by suggesting that she might return to TOWIE, the reality show that made her a household name.

Amy recently told Star magazine:
 'Never say never. I love the show and still watch it. When Lydia 
[Bright] turned up last series, my Twitter went mad with everyone asking
 if I'll go back.'

She added: 'I'll definitely do a cameo one day, maybe next year. I might shock everyone!'

Amy
 recently admitted she had an emergency hospital appointment after her 
left breast implant pulled away from her natural tissue, causing it to 
swell up to twice the size of her right boob.

Will she, won't she? Amy Childs, pictured with TOWIE co-stars Lauren Goodger, Lydia Bright and Sam Faiers in 2011, has hinted at a return to the show that shot her to fame

She told Heat
 magazine she experienced a sharp pain in her chest and now faces the 
possibility of having to have her implants removed and put back in to 
correct the problem.

The reality star first went under the knife to have her boobs augmented at 
the age of 18 in which she went from an AA cup to a D cup - before 
having a second procedure three years later.
