With his trusty rifle, fishing rod and dog for companionship Kristoffer Clausen set to prove to his Norwegian countrymen that he could live in the wilderness without the comforts of modern life.

Unfortunately, for him, this proved too hard and has revealed that during his year-long ordeal he'd spent time in a hotel and even rented a cottage.

The hoaxer told Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet that he even shopped at a local arcade and kept his blog up to date while sat inside a rented car.

To the followers of his blog he wrote this week: 'I'm sorry for doing it. I've been an idiot.'

The great outdoors with a little bit of indoors thrown in: Kristoffer Clausen admits during his 'year in the wilderness' he spent nights in a hotel and even rented a cottage

Mr Clausen's celebrity status was further enhanced when he wrote 'Wild Man: 365 Days As A Hunter, Fisherman and Gatherer'. The book became a best seller

This week he said he was 'very sorry' about not telling the truth and said he should have stopped the challenge in 2009 instead of waiting for the media to discover the truth

It was in August 2009 that Mr Clausen vowed to spend a year in the Norwegian wilderness.

The idea captured the public's 
imagination and he kept them abreast of what was taking place in the 
wilderness through a blog. His celebrity status was further enhanced 
when he wrote a bestselling book - 'A Wild Man: 365 Days as Hunter, 
Fisherman and Gatherer'.

He was offered a sponsorship deal 
with a company making outdoor equipment and appeared on television 
telling his story in a documentary.

Following the revelations of him 
spending time indoors while claiming he was in the great outdoors, the 
production company which made the film said this week it 'felt cheated',
the Daily Telegraph reported.

In his blog Mr Clausen claimed to be 
living 'with what nature was providing for him' in the Central Norway 
forest outside Sognefjorden.

But he said although he had spent some time in the wilderness he visited his father, who was had cancer, twice.

He also admitted he once rented a cottage for four weeks.

Mr Clausen said surviving in the wilderness was 'much tougher' than he had imagined.

He said he was 'very sorry' about not
telling the truth and said he should have taken responsibility and 
stopped the challenge in 2009 instead of waiting for the media to 
discover the truth.

His cover was nearly blown when 
police stopped him crossing the Norwegian-Swedish border and fined him 
for taking a firearm out of the country without a licence.
