These pictures show the devastation caused by a car that smashed into a 16th century pub and then through two rooms in a crash that left the driver in a critical condition.

The car veered off the road and flew through the air before ploughing into the front wall of the 16th century Fox and Hounds pub in Barley, Hertfordshire.

It then crashed through an indoor children's play area and the pub's stock room before lodging into the kitchen wall at the back of the building.

Collision: A 64-year-old driver was said to be in a 'critical condition' at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge today

Danger: The emergency services inspect the hole where the vehicle crashed through and into the heart of the Fox and Hound pub

The 64-year-old driver was today said to be in a critical condition at Addenbrooke's Hospital following the terrifying crash on Tuesday.

He was taken to a specialist trauma centre at the hospital following the serious incident.

No customers or staff were hurt, but the popular village pub now has a gaping hole at the front which has been boarded up temporarily.

Pub owner Adrian Parkes said the Peugeot 306 was being removed from the pub this morning.

He hopes the pub - which was gutted in 2008 because of a fire - will open his doors for drinks for the Friday night rush.

'We've got a mini bus full of cleaners coming as there are shards of glass and dust absolutely everywhere,' Mr Parkes said.

'We've also got the structural engineers coming down with their jacks and builders are coming to board the hole up properly.

'We hope to open on Friday night, if not it will be Saturday for drinks and snacks, and Sunday we will be serving meals.

'It will take a few days until we can serve the full menu again though as most of the food had to be thrown away as everything is homemade.

'Most of the staff are okay now, the chef got a bit upset saying what will we do, but we are just trying to get everything set to open again.'

All three emergency services were called to the scene at around 12.40pm on Tuesday and firefighters had to cut the man out of the vehicle.

The East of England Ambulance Service hazardous area response team, a paramedic ambulance from Letchworth and the Herts Air Ambulance, who landed in Barley Primary School field, were called to the incident.

An ambulance spokesman said: 'On arrival, a man was rapidly extricated from the car embedded in the pub. He suffered serious injuries.'
