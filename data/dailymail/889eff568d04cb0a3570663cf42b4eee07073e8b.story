A Jack Russell whose owner beat him so savagely that bystanders thought he was dead is on the road to recovery.

Shocked eyewitnesses chased Demmi Grice, 25, down the street after they saw the tiny dog punched, lifted up by the collar and then smashed head-first into the pavement.

Grice, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester,
has been found guilty of animal cruelty - and the adorable dog will 
soon be put up for adoption.

Thug: Demmi Grice outside Bury Magistrates' Court. He was found guilty of animal cruelty and banned from keeping pets after saying: 'It's my dog, I don't need lessons. They started chasing me for nothing'

Accused: Grice, 25, swore at a photographer outside court, where he was found guilty of animal cruelty

RSPCA inspector Kat Hamblin said: 'You can tell he hasn't been treated very well as he cowers when people make sudden movements.

'He needs training, but despite everything he's been through, Milo likes people and is a great little dog. With a bit of love and care, he'll make a lovely pet for someone.'

Grice, who was given the dog by his mother, told the court the bystanders had 'rudely interrupted' him on the way to his breakfast, adding: 'It's my dog, I don't need lessons. They started chasing me for nothing.'

Magistrates heard he shouted angrily at Milo, lifting the dog up by the collar several feet into the air.

He then punched the terrified terrier in the head and hurled him to the pavement head-first.

Onlookers chased him as he fled, dragging the dog along the ground by his lead, but they caught up with him and kept him restrained until police arrived.

Daniel
Harris, 24, was in the passenger seat of a car on the way to a job interview when he chased Grice on the morning of October 10.

He told the court: '[Milo] landed head-first and then crumpled to the left as its back 
hit the floor. At this point I made up my mind to get out of the car. I 
genuinely thought he had killed the dog.

'I
was quite distressed, mainly because if he could do that in public I 
was worried what he would do to the animal behind closed doors.'

Grice ran, said Mr Harris, adding: 'The dog's legs were being dragged along the concrete 
pavement because he couldn't keep up with the speed the man was running 
at.'

The driver of the car, teacher Robyn Stevenson, 23, also saw the abuse and followed Grice on foot.

She said: 'I was disgusted that he could do that to 
an animal. He showed no remorse and just screamed "It's my dog".

Attack: Demmi Grice, from Rochdale, had denied smashing Milo's head into the pavement in broad daylight

'I was shaking like a leaf, I've got dogs of my own and it was horrible to watch.'

Grice accepted that he shouted at the dog
and held him up by the lead, but denied one count of causing 
unnecessary suffering to an animal.

Grice, who swore at a photographer as he left court, claimed the witnesses were lying and he had not punched the dog or thrown it to the ground.

He insisted he was a good dog owner and his pet had never missed a meal or a walk.

The yob was banned from keeping animals 
for five years after being convicted of causing unnecessary suffering to
an animal by Bury magistrates.

He was ordered to pay a total of Â£1,049 in fines and costs.

Chairman of the bench Julia De Sousa told 
Grice: 'We find what you did to that little Jack Russell cruel and 
unkind and we hope that is reflected in the sentence.'

Milo will be rehomed if Grice does not lodge an appeal within 21 days.

RSPCA inspector Jason Bowles added: 'In situations like this we always hope for a ban on keeping animals as 
it's the best way of protecting any others from suffering in future.'
