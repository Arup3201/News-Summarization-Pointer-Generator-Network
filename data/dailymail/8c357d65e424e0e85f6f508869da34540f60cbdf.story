An Emmy Award-winning Fox news anchor who allegedly stole $2,500 of designer goods with her fiancé has broken up with him, her attorney confirmed on Wednesday.

Sabrina Rodriguez, 31, turned herself into police last week over an outstanding warrant and was charged with grand theft, burglary and conspiracy to commit a crime. She was released on $10,000 bail. 

She announced on Tuesday that she had resigned from her job and also cut ties with her partner and alleged accomplice Nicholas Gray, 30.

Her lawyer Mark Reichel told News10: 'There's no doubt in my mind that Ms. Rodriguez, with her stellar career and tremendous life choices she's made up until that point, would not be in this kind of trouble if she had not been associated with this individual.'

Mr Reichel said his client would defend her reputation in court. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Mr Reichel today.

The journalist has also employed a public relations expert, Doug Elmets. Soon afterwards, she announced she was no longer in contact with Gray and was focusing on her future.  

Rodriguez, who worked as a TV news presenter for Fox40, was allegedly caught on surveillance camera helping Gray steal ten wallets, worth $2,500, from a Sacramento store in March 2013. 

On the footage, Rodriguez can allegedly be seen  helping Gray conceal his actions as he placed the wallets into his bag.

The presenter was recognized by store employees from her news broadcasts. She was held at the store but not arrested. 

When Gray was arrested in May this year, a search warrant discovered text messages on his iPhone reportedly implicating Rodriguez in the theft. 

In one message, Gray told Rodriguez: 'I got 8 $350 cashmere sweaters plus skirts I got rent'. 

She responded: 'I love when a plan comes together'.

Gray has been involved in crime since the age of 18. He was sentenced to four years in prison for a burglary conviction in 2010 but it is unclear when and where he served his time. 

Gray faces arson charges after an explosion and fire on May 6 at the Sacramento home he shared with Rodriguez. A firefighter was injured in the incident. 

Investigators believe that he was cooking a marijuana product called butane honey oil at the time, according to News10. 

He also faces additional charges of battery and drug possession, KCRA reported. He appeared in court on Monday but did not enter a plea. He is back in court later this month. 

The Fox 40 news reporter has been released on $10,000 bail. Her lawyer said that she 'made bad choices' when she became involved with fiancé Nicholas Gray. The couple have now split up

Rodriguez, who was home at the time of the fire, later spoke about the blaze on Fox and then during her Emmy acceptance speech in June. She also told the audience that she and Gray had just gotten engaged. 

She said in an interview following the awards show: 'I lost everything in a house fire including all of my Emmys... It's been such a humbling experience.'  

The reporter's spokesman said that she was unaware of her fiancé's criminal past when they met.  

Rodriguez announced her resignation on her Facebook page on Tuesday and her intentions to clear her name. 

She wrote: 'I am heartbroken to say, I have decided to resign my position at FOX40. Given the recent media attention I feel it was the best decision to make.

'The past three years at FOX40 have been absolutely wonderful. From management to my colleagues in the newsroom and other departments, everyone is talented and kind. It's been a blessing to work and learn from all of you.

'To the viewers, thank you for your incredible love and support. It's overwhelming.

'Resigning was not an easy decision to make, but it's one that will allow me to focus on my case and work to reestablish my good name.'

She will be arraigned on August 29.  

A Fox40 spokesperson recently told MailOnline: 'We were informed late Thursday July 31 that legal action has been taken against anchor Sabrina Rodriguez.

'These charges relate to a personal situation with Ms. Rodriguez that is not related to her work at Fox40.

'Sabrina maintains she is innocent of these allegations. She has been granted a voluntary leave of absence from the station.'
