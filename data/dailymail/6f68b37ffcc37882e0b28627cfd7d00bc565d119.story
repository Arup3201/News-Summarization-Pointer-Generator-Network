The reforms are part of David Cameron's scheme to promote gay equality

Same-sex couples will be able to get married in register offices or in ceremonies at stately homes or hotels under sweeping reforms of marriage law put forward by ministers yesterday.

But the laws on wedding ceremonies that allow only men and women to marry in church will remain untouched in David Cameron’s scheme to promote gay equality.

Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone said: ‘I believe that if a couple love each other and want to commit to a life together, they should have the option of a civil marriage, whatever their gender.

‘Marriage is a celebration of love and should be open to everyone.’

However, the Church of England launched a fierce condemnation of the reforms. It accused the Coalition of misunderstanding the law of marriage and confusing wedding ceremonies with the institution of marriage.

The reforms were published in a Home Office consultation paper that will allow three months discussion before legislation is drawn up and MPs get a free vote on whether to legalise gay marriage.

For same-sex couples, the proposals will mean those who want to formalise their relationships will have choice between civil marriage and civil partnerships, which have been open to gay and lesbian couples since 2005. Civil partnerships will continue to be available, but civil partners will have the option to convert their relationships into marriages.

There will be minor changes to bring civil partnerships and marriages into line in the remaining areas of legal difference between them. For example, in future civil partners will be able to end their partnership on grounds of adultery, an option for divorce currently open only to married couples.

The new marriage law will also allow people who undergo sex changes to stay married. At present, people who change their sex in law by taking out a Gender Recognition Certificate must divorce, but when same-sex marriage is legalised they will not be required to end their own marriage.

Ministers said the new law would not affect religious marriage, which they say will become a different legal concept from civil marriage.

‘Marriages conducted through a religious ceremony and on religious premises can only be between a man and a woman,’ the Home Office paper said.

But the Church of England said: ‘The issue of whether marriage should be redefined to include those of the same-sex is a more complicated picture than has been painted.

‘Arguments that suggest “religious marriage” is separate and different from “civil marriage”, and will not be affected by the proposed redefinition, misunderstand the legal nature of marriage in this country. They mistake the form of the ceremony for the institution itself.’

The CofE added that it is ‘committed to the traditional understanding of the institution of marriage as being between one man and one woman.'

Earlier this week it was claimed that parents could be legally referred to as  'Progenitor A' and 'Progenitor B' under the same sex marriage plans.

Leading lawyer and Labour peer Lord Brennan QC, an opponent of same sex marriage, said, if the institution of marriage is 
redefined, the erosion of traditional words such as 'mother' and 
'father' from British law could have 'Orwellian' consequences.

He also claimed the removal of such words from the statute books could result in legislative chaos.

More than 200,000 campaigners have signed a 
petition on the No 10 website in support of keeping marriage between 
husbands and wives, making it the biggest active campaign in Britain.

The petition was launched by the 
Coalition for Marriage (C4M), with 7,500 people signing it every day.
