Clive Palmer’s former accountant and friend claims that the politician’s businesses were on the brink of bankruptcy during his Federal election campaign last year.

In an affidavit, Palmer's former top executive and campaigning partner Bill Schoch claims that while Mr Palmer was publically claiming to be a billionaire, his companies were experiencing a cashflow crisis.

Mr Schoch alleges the companies were on the verge of corporate financial collapse and Mr Palmer was so desperate for funds that he accepted a settlement deal from the tax office just two days after the 2013 federal election.

Mr Palmer’s former friend and auditor, Bill Schoch, has submitted the affidavit to the Supreme Court as he prepares for court proceedings, according to The Weekend Australian.

Mr Schoch claims he has used financial documentation, corporate records and personal knowledge to compile his affidavit.

Bill Schoch worked with Clive Palmer for more than thirty years, initially as his auditor and handling Palmer's tax affairs. In 2011 Palmer hired Schoch to be a salaried executive

In the documents, Mr Schoch claims that Mr Palmer narrowly avoided insolvency over a $15 million debt to a Singapore-based company, shortly before Mr Palmer won political office.

It is alleged that Palmer agreed to receive around half of the $90 million amount allegedly owed to him by the tax office, to ensure his company was not left ‘without cash’.

The agreement allowed him to readily access $44.9m by September 2013 to alleviate the ‘cash flow challenges’ the Palmer Group was experiencing, according to Schoch's affidavit.

In his affidavit, Schoch alleges the amount Palmer’s business owed to other companies in June of last year was ‘about the equivalent of the available cash at bank’ and claims financial accounts for Palmer’s business, Mineralogy, confirms the company only had access to $16.19m, with $US15m owing.

Mr Palmer allegedly owed the money to BGP Geoexplorer Pty Ltd after a two-year project, which cost a total of $US35m.

Schoch claims that Palmer's businesses were on the brink of bankruptcy last year, whilst Palmer was involved campaigning for office before the 2013 Federal election

BGP Geoexplorer was contracted to undertake seismic surveying of the sea bed off Papua New Guinea, where Palmer had identified a potential billion gas region. His company Palmer Petroleum, controlled by Mineralogy, had been granted exploration rights.

The affidavit follows allegations that Palmer fraudulently withdrew more than $12m to bankroll his party in the election – wrongfully using funds from a planned joined venture the Chinese government-owned company, Citic Pacific.

Palmer has denied that he breached the company’s trust to siphone $10m in August and $2.167m in September of last year. He maintains the money was used appropriately for the project with Citic Pacific.

Schoch has launched Supreme Court action against Palmer and two of his companies, Mineralogy and Queensland Nickel, seeking damages after he was sacked by Mr Palmer in December last year.

Bill Schoch is suing his former boss for more than $4.6 million over an alleged breach of contract and misleading conduct. 

Clive Palmer was Bill Schoch’s friend and client for more than 30 years, until a bitter feud ensued after Schoch’s sacking in December 2013.

Scoch handled Palmer’s tax affairs and audited his businesses from 1978 until 2006. In 2011 he was hired to be a salaried executive.

Schoch alleges in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court that whilst Palmer was maintaining his public image as a multi-billionaire, he struck a settlement with the tax office to avoid insolvency

Schoch began work with Palmer in June 2011. Schoch claims Mr Palmer promised him $5 million for five years of work, on the terms that he began on a ‘starting salary for a short time, and then go up to the million a year when the money comes in.’

When Palmer sacked Schoch in December 2013, he allegedly told his former friend ‘You don’t have a contract for five years. Your f***ing contract is for $150 thousand. Leave by Tuesday. Sue me’, according to court documents.

Schoch maintains that he was misled by an oral agreement with Palmer about the terms of his employment. 

The affidavit claims Palmer then sent Schoch an invoice, demanding Schoch pay $633,150 for the cost of Schoch’s accommodation and meals whilst Schoch worked as resident manager at Palmer’s Hyatt Regency Resort on the Sunshine Court.

Schoch’s affidavit claims that Palmer’s companies were ‘running near empty’ as they were not being paid royalties by Citic Pacific.

Schoch claims Palmer expected up to $500 million a year from Citic Pacific, as royalties for the mining of iron ore. However, litigation between the partners meant Palmer had allegedly largely overestimated the company’s income.

Palmer had once praised Schoch for his ‘impeccable character’, but in light of Schoch's affidavit, Palmer told The Australian that Schoch is ‘just not a truthful person.’
