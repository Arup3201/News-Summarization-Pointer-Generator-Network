Last October's explosion of Orbital ATK Inc's Antares rocket may have been triggered when debris inadvertently left in a fuel tank traveled into the booster's main engine, two people familiar with investigations into the accident told Reuters.

The sources said the preliminary findings suggest that a simple assembly mistake by Orbital ATK could have caused the explosion, which destroyed a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station.

Orbital initially linked the explosion to a problem with the turbo pump in one of the two Soviet-era NK-33 engines that power the rocket. GenCorp Inc's Aerojet Rocketdyne unit refurbishes the old motors and resells them as AJ-26 motors.

Cameras recovered from the launch pad in Virginia shed new light on disaster (still image shown).The remotely operated cameras captured the explosion up-close in incredible detail.

The Antares rocket was due to launch an unmanned Orbital-3 Cygnus spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the International Space Station on 28 October.

This included science experiments, experiment hardware, spare parts, and crew provisions - as part of a £1.2 billion ($1.9billion) deal with Nasa.

Outfitted with a new, more powerful upper-stage engine, the Antares rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds (2,293 kg) of supplies, science experiments and equipment, a 15 percent increase over previous missions.

But just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed, leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure. 

Orbital ATK on Friday acknowledged that so-called 'foreign object debris' was one of more than a half dozen credible causes of the explosion, but said it was not 'a leading candidate as the most probable cause of the failure.'

Orbital spokesman Barry Beneski said the company-led 'accident investigation board,' which includes officials from NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, had not identified any evidence of mishandling of the flight hardware by Orbital.

He said Orbital continued to compare data from the October explosion with a May 2014 test stand failure of a different AJ-26 engine, and prior failures involving AJ-26 ground tests in 2009, 2011 and 2012.

No details have been released on the May 2014 test stand incident, but sources familiar with the earlier investigation said it was likely linked to faulty 'workmanship' on the original motor, and additional inspections had been mandated to prevent mishaps with other engines. Orbital also successfully launched one Antares rocket in July 2014, after the May incident.

NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said NASA was conducting its own internal 'lessons learned' review of the accident, but declined to give any details about individual aspects of the investigation.

She agreed with Orbital that foreign object debris was always considered as a possible cause in aerospace accidents.

If the investigations confirm that debris from the fuel tanks caused the Antares explosion, that could have significant financial and legal effects for Orbital ATK, which was formed by the merger of Orbital Sciences Corp and Alliant Techsystems.

The new findings could also open the door for a legal claim against Orbital by GenCorp, which took a $17.5 million loss in October, after Orbital said the accident had prompted it to accelerate plans to switch to a different engine.

One source said the Orbital investigation could end without declaring a single 'root cause' for the explosion. 

Probes of past accidents have had similar results.

Officials have confirmed the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport launchpad in Virginia (shown after the explosion) could be repaired as soon as 2015. The Antares rocket exploded seconds after lift-off on 28 October, but in a statement it was revealed the pad escaped severe damage

Several sources said it may be difficult to determine conclusively whether the debris entered the engine before the explosion, or as a result of it.

Glenn Mahone, spokesman for Aerojet Rocketdyne, declined to comment on the investigations, noting that they were still underway. He also declined to comment on the cause of the May test stand failure, which is part of the investigation.

One of the sources familiar with the probe said investigators found particles of a crystallized desiccant, or drying agent, in the turbo pump and other parts of the AJ-26 engine. The crystals could have caused sparks and triggered a fire when they hit the turbo pump in the oxygen-rich environment, the source said.

Desiccants are often used to control moisture in fuel tanks but need to be removed before takeoff, the sources said.

Orbital Sciences have said a new version of Antares could launch as soon as 2016. This will be using new engines, which will be tested in a 'hot fire' next year. Just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed, leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure (shown)

The explosion partially contaminated the region around the launchpad. But last week the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority revealed it would take just a year to repair the damage. Repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £8.3 million and £12.8 million ($13 million and $20 million)

While the NASA investigation had not finalized the root cause of the accident, there were multiple signs that suggested some 'foreign object debris' had been ingested into the engine from the fuel tanks, one source said.

Antares had four previous successful flights. The Oct. 28 explosion was the first accident since NASA began using commercial providers to fly cargo to the space station.

Orbital already faces steep bills for damage to the launch site, and the need to buy a different rocket to launch its next cargo ship to the space station.

In December, the company said it would buy a booster from United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, to meet its obligations under a $1.9 billion cargo supply contract with NASA.

Orbital is one of two companies NASA hired to fly 40,000 pounds of cargo each to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. Privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, has the other contract, valued at $1.6 billion.

Repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £8.3 million and £12.8 million ($13 million and $20 million).

And in a separate release, Orbital confirmed they would launch a new Antares rocket by the end of 2016. 

'Under the new approach and in line with Orbital's existing CRS contract, all remaining cargo will be delivered to the International Space Station (ISS) by the end of 2016,' said the company.

'There will be no cost increase to Nasa and only minor adjustments will be needed to the cargo manifest in the near term.'

Orbital also confirmed they will seek a new propulsion system upgrade for Antares, as it was believed the Russian engines used on the October launch were the reason for the failure.

The company will perform a 'hot fire' test of the new engines next year to ensure they work as planned.  

The Nasa-funded rocket exploded on its way to the ISS (shown) just six seconds after lift-off from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island in Virginia .The rocket exploded at 6:22pm EDT on 28 October, and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine

Organisations said more than £125 million ($200 million) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion (previous image shown). Orbital Sciences said it would stop using the type of Russian engines that were employed when its unmanned Antares commercial supply rocket exploded

They explained how in the first aerial surveys of the launch pad they could see their cameras, but they had to wait several weeks to get everything back from the Accident Investigation Board.

One of the cameras was even located very close to the middle of the pad and right in the middle of the explosion.

As dust and debris flies around, the camera somehow manages to survive.  

The rocket was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine and also a number of Earth-observation satellites.

Organisations said more than £125 million ($200 million) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion.
