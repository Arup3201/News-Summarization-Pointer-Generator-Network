It's the fitness craze that sees volunteers pay good money to be screamed at by drill sergeants.

But one military-style boot camp has left more than just its customers feeling sore.

Craig and Paula Williams charge up to £1,000 a week for gruelling training sessions on the grounds of their Grade II-listed home – but their wealthy neighbours claim that life in their quiet hamlet has been ruined by the constant screeching of the couple's fitness instructors.

The bootcamp, in the grounds of the couple's Grade II listed home, has attracted criticism from neighbours

Residents have complained that the camp, set up last year, is too loud and creates too much traffic.

The bootcamp has attracted the likes of James Argent from TOWIE and Binky Felstead, from Made in Chelsea

Residents in Heydour, in Oasby, Lincolnshire, where property prices start at £900,000, now want to see the business shut down. One local, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Since the boot camp arrived my life has become miserable.

'There was a time when my partner and I enjoyed the peace and tranquillity this area has to offer. We both work hard and have been rewarded with a certain level of lifestyle, which we are not ashamed about.

'What we do not appreciate is our world being disturbed by what can only be described as a drill sergeant screaming commands to overweight people as they struggle to touch their toes.'

Former Royal Marine Mr Williams, 37, launched TEAM Bootcamp with his wife, 36, after spending 15 years in the military. 

It is based at their home, Heydour House, a ten-bedroom former rectory worth £1million. Built in 1857, it boasts a four-acre garden, including a tennis court.

The firm's website claims that clients can lose 8-11lb per week 'in a safe and secluded environment free from the trials of day-to-day life'.

All of the boot camp's fitness instructors have served in the Forces.

The business opened this summer – but the owners did not apply for planning permission until weeks after it began operating.

Heydour is a picturesque hamlet mentioned in the Domesday Book. It is situated nine miles north-east of Grantham in Lincolnshire.

It has a Grade-I listed Anglican parish church dedicated to St Michael which originates from the 12th century.

The hamlet's school was closed in 1983 and the nearest post office and shop is two miles away in Wilsford.

Heydour House, where the Team Bootcamp is based, is a former rectory built in 1857 which was given a Grade-II listed status in 1984.

The ten-bedroom property boasts a four-acre garden with a tennis court and a grand entrance hall complete with a stone archway.

On their website, Team Bootcamp boast that clients can lose 8-11 lbs per week 'in a safe and secluded environment free from the trials of day-to-day life.'

They are currently running half price winter week-long camps which cost charge £449 for shared accommodation, with clients paying £547 for a twin room or £597 for a single room.

Since it opened, it has attracted celebrities such as Binky Felstead, Calum Best and The Only Way is Essex's James Argent.  

This week the application was deferred, after more than two dozen letters of objection were sent by disgruntled locals. 

They complain that loud music regularly blared out from the site is 'affecting the environment', and say the camp's popularity has seen the previously peaceful area overwhelmed with traffic.

Parish council chairman Michael Bromige, 79, who lives half a mile away from the Williamses, said: 'The noise from the boot camp has been very intrusive, with music and shouted commands.'

Neighbour Andy Soper added: 'The hamlet comprises our cemetery, church and eight houses. It is an extremely quiet area and the cemetery has always been a place of peace. There is a huge amount of intrusive noise from the boot camp, totally unsuitable for our small hamlet. It is upsetting for those visiting graves of loved ones.'

Another local, Paul Richardson, told how clients often go on group runs around the village. 'I don't particularly like seeing [them],' he said. 'The building should be used for offices or something that doesn't affect other people.'

Mr Williams, who has served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sierra Leone, said: 'I am used to hostile environments all over the world. The feeling I get when I walk through the village is the same, it's not nice.'

Despite the criticism, the couple are determined to carry on running the bootcamp from their home

Training days begin at 7am with a circuit session followed by a workout on the custom built obstacle course

The couple plan to stay in the hamlet. 'We have taken great steps to reduce the noise, and have created a noise and disturbance management plan,' Mr Williams said. 

'The noise does travel really well here and we are aware of it. We spend a lot of time and energy keeping on top of the noise and the complaints and we have stopped using music and our trainers from shouting.'

Mrs Williams, who has always worked in the fitness industry, said: 'The lady next door says having a boot camp next door to her is devaluing her house. She doesn't like to look at it, it is all down to snobbery.' 

The couple both used to work for No.1 Bootcamp, a similar company used by Strictly Come Dancing finalist Mark Wright. 

Their new business offers packages which cover accommodation at Heydour House and outdoor exercise sessions on the property's grounds.

South Kesteven District Council is due to make a final decision on whether the camp can stay open in the New Year.
