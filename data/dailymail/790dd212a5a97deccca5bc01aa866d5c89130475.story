Facebook is expected to begin the process of becoming a public company today, according to reports.

The social network is expected to raise $10billion in the most hotly anticipated technology IPO in a decade, a figures that would dwarf Google's $1.9billion initial public offering in 2004.

On that amount the company would be valued at $75billion to $100billion vaulting it into the ranks of the largest public companies in the world, on par with the likes of McDonald's, Amazon.com and Visa.

While Facebook has refused to confirm the IPO, regular investors and IPO specialists are anticipating some kind of twist - perhaps a 
provision for the 800million users of Facebook to get in on the action.

Like: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth is $17.5billion and he owns 24 per cent of the social network, previously worth $5.3billion

Facebook CEO and founder 
Mark Zuckerberg, 27, is anything but a conformist. He turns up at 
business conventions in a hoodie and famously spurned a $15billion takeover offer from Microsoft.

'Pandemonium is what I expect in 
terms of demand for this stock,' said Scott Sweet, senior managing 
partner at IPO Boutique, an advisory firm.

'I don't think Wall Street would want to anger Facebook users.'

An initial public offering is the launch of a company on the stock market where shares in the company are offered for the first time, resulting in a share price being set and the company being valued. 

After filing its initial paperwork, a public offering usually takes three to four months.

The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said that the social-networking company could raise as much as $10 billion in an offering that would value the company at $75 billion to $100 billion.

Either measure would dwarf the $1.9 billion raised in Google's 2004 IPO. That offering gave Google a market value of $23 billion. Google is now worth $184 billion.

Zuckerberg is already considered a billionaire because of shares traded on a closed market. Facebook spokesman Larry Wu said the company will not comment on IPO-related speculation.

For the state of California it can't come soon enough. The fiscally challenged state expects a tax windfall after the IPO.

In 2006, two years after Google went 
public, 16 Google insiders paid the state $380million in taxes after 
cashing in 9 million shares - enough to cover the salaries of more than 
3,000 state workers.

When a company goes public stockholders can't sell the shares right away, so takes a little while for the tax income to flow in.

The main reason for an IPO is to produce a profit
for the company, adding to Mr Zuckerberg’s already estimated net worth 
of $17.5 billion with the expected sale of the company's securities.

At $100 billion valuation, the company
started by Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room would have double the 
valuation of Hewlett-Packard, the Journal said.

Facebook's IPO would dwarf that of any other dotcom waiting to go public.

'Farmville'
creator Zynga has filed for an IPO of up to $1 billion. In November, 
daily deals service Groupon debuted with much fanfare, only to plunge 
below its IPO price within weeks.

LinkedIn
and Pandora are now also trading significantly below the levels their 
stocks reached during their public debuts earlier this year.

Facebook has become one of the 
world's most popular Web destinations, challenging established companies
such as Google Inc and Yahoo Inc for consumers' online time and for 
advertising dollars.

Facebook does not disclose its 
financial results, but a source familiar with the situation told Reuters
earlier this year that the company's revenue in the first six months of
2011 doubled year-on-year to $1.6 billion.

Eric
Feng, a former partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield
& Byers who now runs social-networking site Erly.com, said that the
cash Facebook will get in an IPO would allow them to make more 
acquisitions and refine or work on new projects, such as a 
rumored-Facebook phone or a netbook.

Having tradeable stock will also 
allow Facebook to attract more engineering talent who might have been 
more attracted to the company in earlier days when it was growing faster
but now perhaps might be attracted to other companies.

'It'll be a powerful bullet for them,' said Feng.

Investors
have been increasingly eager to buy shares of Facebook and other 
fast-growing but privately-held Internet social networking companies on 
special, secondary-market exchanges.

Facebook
said last January that it will exceed 500 shareholders in 2011, and 
that in accordance with SEC regulations, it will file public financial 
reports no later than April 30, 2012.
