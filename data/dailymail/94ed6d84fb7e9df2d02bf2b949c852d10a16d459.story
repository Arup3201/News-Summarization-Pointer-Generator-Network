A 14-year-old accused of the murder of his mother and sister allegedly told detectives 'I want people to die,' hours after they were both killed when a severe fire swept through their home.

Samuel Vonachen was said to have made the confession after fire fighters discovered the bodies of his mother, Karla Jo, and 11-year-old sister, Audrey, huddled together in a bedroom.

The pair were rushed to hospital where they were declared dead a short time later. 

His father Steven Vonachen, escaped the inferno in Hutchinson, Kansas, in September 2013.

The teen, now aged 15, allegedly said 'I did it,'  as detectives pointed out the flaws in his story, according to Hutchnews.com

The alleged video confession was played during a preliminary hearing, ahead of the teenager's trial for two counts of premeditated first degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and aggravated arson.  

'I did it,' he said in the video played to the court, the news site reported.

'I want people to die.People are awful. Everyone is awful, but I'm not.' 

Vonachen, now aged 15, also reportedly explained to detectives how he had taken a gas canister from the garage and poured the liquid over several rooms before setting it alight. 

He said it 'didn't matter who lived and died,' according to Hutchnews.com.

As the family home was engulfed in flames Vonachen dialed 911 to report the blaze using the made-up name of Dominique Deets. 

During the police interview, pictured above, Vonachen also reportedly explained how he had taken a gas canister and poured the liquid over several rooms

When later questioned about why he didn't alert his family to the fire and used a made-up name he told police he didn't know and was scared.

When officers arrived at the home Vonachen could not be found and was later arrested by police walking along the side of the road.

He is scheduled to be arraigned on March 2.
