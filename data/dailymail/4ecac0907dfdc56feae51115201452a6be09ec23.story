Rangers legend Walter Smith has accused Celtic striker John Guidetti of disrespecting the Ibrox club by claiming he fancies a hat-trick in this weekend’s Old Firm showdown.

Last month, the Sweden striker said he hoped to become the first Parkhead player to score a treble against Rangers since Harry Hood in 1973 when the clubs meet in the Scottish League Cup semi-final at Hampden on Sunday.

But Smith said the public pronouncement by the on-loan Manchester City man - who has not scored since November - showed a lack of respect towards the club he managed to 10 league titles during two spells at the helm in Govan. Smith also believes his comments give Rangers a better chance of causing a shock.

‘You’ve got to have an overall respect for the teams you play against,’ said Smith.

‘Rangers will have a respect for Celtic. I’m not so sure Celtic are showing the same respect, with some of the comments their players are making. One of them’s talking about scoring a hat-trick.

‘A few years ago, the games would have been much tighter in terms of how everybody’s perception of how the game is going to be. But I don’t think you can turn round and disrespect your opponents by saying you’re going to score three.

‘If that is an overall feeling that Celtic have got, then it gives Rangers probably a better opportunity than maybe they should have.’

Rangers trail Hearts by 13 points in the Championship while Celtic are top of the Premiership by three points with a game in hand over Aberdeen. Despite the constant chaos on and off the park - with Ally McCoist resigning and McDowall handing his own notice in last week - Smith insists Rangers can upset the ‘overwhelming favourites’.

‘Of course they can,’ he told BBC Scotland on Thursday. ‘Their results this season, some have been indifferent, but in the three cup games against Premier Division teams, they’ve won these games. And I don’t think Celtic are as good now as they were a couple of seasons ago.’

Meanwhile, Raith Rovers have backed down and given Rangers an allocation of away tickets to sell for next month’s league meeting between the sides after being reassured over the Ibrox club’s financial predicament.

After it emerged this week that Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct would be providing £10million of funding to the cash-strapped Govan outfit, Raith have had a change of heart over the arrangements surrounding the February 20 encounter.

The Kirkcaldy club had initially taken the unusual step of selling briefs direct to Rangers fans, with the move stemming from concerns over the Ibrox club’s ability to reimburse Rovers the ticket money had they handled the sale.

However, following an angry response to the move and the latest cash injection at Ibrox, the Stark’s Park outfit have handed over a reduced allocation to Rangers, whilst continuing to sell tickets themselves.

Eric Drysdale, Rovers’ chief executive, explained: ‘We have reached a compromise with Rangers following developments this week.

‘The temporary funding situation has improved so we have given them a smaller-than-normal allocation.

‘We took the view, quite simply, that we needed to do what we considered to be right in order to protect our own position.

‘We had to limit any risk of our own finances being affected by the on-going difficulties at Ibrox.’
