The wife of a $1 million Chicago lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide before he collected his winnings has revealed her husband was a 'good person' who didn't have any enemies.

Shabana Ansari has opened up about losing 46-year-old Urooj Khan, who immigrated to the U.S. with from India in 1989.

Describing Mr Khan as a hard-working, generous man who would send money to orphanages in their native country, Ms Ansari said her husband's death devastated her and added that she cannot fathom that he had any adversaries.

'I was shattered. I can't believe he's no longer with me,' she said, from one of the couple's three dry cleaners.

Foul play: A family member called police to say Khan had not suffered a 'natural death' after he had been buried. His body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal

Fateful purchase: Khan spent $60 in June on two Illinois state lottery tickets. The second one of which proved to be a winning ticket

Habit: Khan was revealed to have spent up to $600 a day on scratchcards

'I don't think anyone would have a bad eye for him or that he had any enemy,' Ms Ansari said, adding that she continues to work at the dry cleaner out of a desire to honor her husband and the businesses he built.

Ms Ansari, 32, moved to the U.S. from India after marrying Khan 12 years ago.

Mr Khan and his wife were born in Hyderabad, India, and their story is a typical immigrant's tale of settling in a new land with big dreams and starting a business. Their daughter, Jasmeen, is a student here.

'Work was his passion,' Ms Ansari said. 'I'm just taking care of his hard work.'

Ms Ansari wouldn't talk about the mysterious circumstances of her husband's death, saying it was too painful. But she says she hopes the truth will come out in the homicide investigation.

Mr Khan's death on July 20 was initially ruled a result of natural causes.

A relative's request for a deeper 
look resulted in the conclusion months later that the father-of-one was 
poisoned as he was about to collect $425,000 in winnings.

The relative, who called a medical 
examiner demanding a fresh inquiry into the poisoning, 'didn't accept it was going to be a natural 
death,' MailOnline revealed earlier today.

In a dramatic phone call, Mr Khan's 
family member flatly rejected the original ruling and ordered 
investigators to have another look.

Now
after further tests revealed Mr Khan, of Chicago's North Side, died due
to cyanide poisoning his body is set to be exhumed - so his final meal 
can be examined.

Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday that he had never seen anything like Mr Khan's case in his 32 years of policing in New York, New Jersey and now Chicago.

'So, I'm not going to say that I've seen everything,' Mr McCarthy said.

Prosecutors, Chicago police and the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office are investigating Khan's death as a homicide, but they have not given any details or announced any suspects.

MailOnline 
has also revealed that according to a respected poison expert, Mr Khan 
would have ingested the killer dose no more than an hour before he died.

According
to a police report cited by the Chicago Tribune, that fateful day Mr 
Khan arrived at his Chicago home with his wife, Ms Ansari, and daughter,
Jasmeen, and ate some dinner.

He then went to bed before waking up screaming as his body was 'suffocated cell by cell.'

Mr Khan won $1m on the Illinois State Lottery last June but went to collect his winnings on July 20.

The
initial examination by the Cook County Medical examiner found he had 
died of heart disease, or natural causes. Drugs like cyanide do not show
up on standard toxicology reports.

However, after the intervention of a relative, a more thorough toxicology report was ordered.

The cause of death has now been ruled as poisoning by cyanide and it is being treated as a homicide by Chicago police.

No signs of foul play: An initial autopsy on Khan performed by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office found nothing awry

Cook County Medical Examiner Stephen 
Cina told MailOnline: 'I believe they called up and said they wanted to 
us to look into it further.

'They didn’t accept it was going to be a natural death.'

Mr
Cina added that he hopes to exhume Mr Khan's body within ‘the next few 
weeks’ from Chicago’s Rosehill Cemetery and that an analysis of the 
content of his stomach could take place afterwards.

Mr
Cina said: 'I have had one cyanide death in 4,500 autopsies so they are
unusual, as are exhumations. To have a case where there is both is very
unusual.'

Mr Khan emigrated to the US during the
1980s from India, and through hard work and discipline, saved up enough
cash to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in 
Chicago.

Last June he paid 
$60 for two lottery scratch-off tickets at a 7-Eleven convenience store near
his home and, upon scratching the second one, reportedly leaped in the 
air and shouted, 'I hit a million!'

Days
later, with his wife and daughter at his side at the same store, Mr 
Khan gleefully accepted an oversized, mock check from lottery officials.

At
the time, he said he was going to use the money to pay bills, donate to
St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Chicago and grow his dry-cleaning 
business.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000.

Illinois State Lottery spokesman Mike Lang said that it was eventually cashed August 15 and that if a lottery winner dies, the money typically goes to his or her estate.

He had recently returned to Chicago from the hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia inspired to lead a better life and had sworn off buying lottery tickets - except just this once. His Islamic faith dictates that he should not even have been gambling in the first place.

A good man: The cashier at the 7-Eleven where Khan bought his fateful lotto tickets said Khan was a 'gentle' man and a 'nice person' who cared for his family

Jimmy Goreel, 51, the manager of the 
7-Eleven store where Mr Khan bought the ticket, said that in 2011 Mr Khan 
became ‘addicted’ to scratchcards and used to come in every day spending
up to $600 a time.

He said:
'Mr Khan would buy an entire book of scratchcards and would leave them 
with me the next morning and ask me to work out how much he had won.

'That lasted about two months then he realised he had to slow down. 

'He started getting addicted to it and he said he had to stop as he was a working person and a family man. A lot of the times he would come in his wife would come together with him.'

Deborah
Blum, a poison expert whose book 'The Poisoner's Handbook' is being 
made into a PBS TV series, said that Mr Khan would have been in 
'absolute agony' and likely coughed up blood as he was killed.

A
former chemist, Miss Blum said: 'A good lethal dose of cyanide will 
kill you in 10 minutes. A mid range dose and people die within the hour.
For a poison that's pretty fast.

'Cyanide
poisoning is a nasty death. There is an enzyme which allows your cells 
to breathe and the cyanide wipes that enzyme out. It suffocates you cell by cell. Symptoms include seizures, extreme shortness of breath and usually cardiac arrest.

'There
is something known as a 'cyanide scream' where your muscles are 
contracting, so this could be what Mr Khan’s relatives heard.'

Miss Blum added that cyanide would have had a bitter taste and that the best way to disguise it would be to put it into spicy food.

A mere 200mg would be enough to take somebody's life, and that could be obtained from pesticides or certain kinds of rat poison.

Historically, money is a 'good reason' why people poison, Miss Blum explained.

She said: 'In the 19th century they used to call cyanide 'inheritance powder' because so many people used it to get their inheritance early.

'People also poison to punish, such as getting revenge on their boss, or to end a relationship that they want out of.

'Poisoners are unique killers because they are never impulsive. Poisoners are planners. 

'There's always an element of calculation, and they think they will get away with it - just as nearly happened in this case.'

Ms Ansari earlier told The Chicago Tribune: 'By God's grace, he was a workaholic. Day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7. He made the clients happy by doing his job. He could not be everywhere, but he had to be everywhere.'

Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Melissa Stratton confirmed the department was now investigating the death.

No arrests have so far been made.
