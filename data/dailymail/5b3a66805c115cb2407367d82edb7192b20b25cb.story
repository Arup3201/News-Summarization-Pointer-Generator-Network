The number of unemployed women aged 50 and older has increased by almost half since the Coalition came to power, according to official figures.

Experts warn that women searching for work are particularly vulnerable at a time when the State pension age is rising.

Before David Cameron entered Downing Street in 2010, there were 111,000 unemployed women aged 50  and older.

Today there are 162,000, according to the Office for National Statistics – a 45 per cent increase.

While women have suffered in the jobs market, men have not.

Over the same four-year period, the number of unemployed men has plunged from 263,000 to 229,000, according to the ONS.

Women used to be able to start claiming their State pension at the age of 60, but this is being gradually increased under the Government’s timetable. It is currently 62 and  one month.

Under the current plan, the State pension age for men and women will reach 65 by 2018, 66 by 2020, 67 by 2028, 68 by the ‘mid-2030s’ and 69 by the ‘late-2040s’.

Labour warns older women are being failed by the Government’s flagship employment scheme, the Work Programme.

Under the scheme, providers from the voluntary, private and public  sectors are paid according to results to get people into work, with extra incentives to support the hardest  to help.

Shadow equalities minister Sharon Hodgson, says David Cameron has 'no answer to the cost of living crisis affecting tens of thousands of older women and their families.'

Sharon Hodgson, the shadow equalities minister, said: ‘These  figures are yet more proof that David Cameron has no answer to the cost of living crisis affecting tens of  thousands of older women and  their families.

‘His Work Programme is failing them, and thousands more find themselves unemployed under  this Government.

‘If we’re going to build a sustainable recovery, we need to ensure that  we don’t waste the talents of some  of our most experienced and  valuable workers.’

However, a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions dismissed Labour’s claim as  ‘absolute nonsense’.

She said the rise in the number of unemployed older women can only be seen in the context of a much larger increase in the number of women in this age group who have decided to enter the workforce.

Around 250,000 older women aged between 50 and 64 have moved from ‘inactivity’ – that is, not looking for work – to either working or looking for work over the last four years.

The DWP spokesman said: ‘The proportion of women between 50 and 64 who are in work is at its highest level ever.’

She added that the Government will ‘shortly’ appoint a business champion for older workers.
