It has been a bad start to the Super Bowl weekend for Justin Bieber after his private jet was held at a New Jersey airport for several hours and his custom-made car was towed.

Police searched the private jet, which 'smelled of pot', after Bieber and his father landed at Teterboro airport yesterday with a posse of the 19-year-old's friends.

There was further drama for the singer this morning as his chrome-plated Fisker Karma sports car was seen being towed from his Calabasas home in California.

With two pending criminal cases - driving under the influence in Miami and allegedly assaulting a limo driver in Toronto - customs officials decided to stop Bieber as he arrived in New Jersey, TMZ reported.

No drugs were found and the singer and his entourage, who had arrived at about 2.50pm were allowed to leave the airport on Friday evening.

The singer’s representatives have not yet responded to a Mail Online request for further comment.

Bieber was questioned for five hours being being released, and the private jet he had hired was searched by sniffer dogs, after police detected a smell of marijuana.

'He came in, the jet smelled like weed ... because of the Super Bowl they’re doing more security checks,' an airport source told the New York Post.

It is not yet clear why his distinctive car was being towed from his California home.

The delays at the airport appeared to have little effect on the singer, who was spotted being mobbed by young fans when he arrived at a New York hotel on Friday night.

And, at 2am the young singer was at a Maxim Super Bowl party, which was filled with models and scantily clad women dancing on raised platforms.

After being escorted in through a back entrance, Bieber was taken to a roped off private table where his security guards kept a close watch.

Anytime a party-goer tried to grab a picture of the singer, a bodyguard would block their way or knock the phone or camera from their hand, according to People.

A few photos did emerge of the singer however. In one he is seen making a rude gesture while standing on a platform at the end of the room, while young women dance below him.

Party-goers described his security as being aggressive, claiming they elbowed people out of the way as Bieber walked through the club, and shone torches in the eyes of anyone trying to take a photo.

As a photo of Bieber making a rude gesture at a camera was featured on TMZ another damning photo emerged showing the teen pop sensation and his friend sucking the nipples of a busty stripper in a Los Angeles recording studio.

It has been a turbulent time for the 
Canadian star, who turned himself into Toronto authorities on Wednesday 
after being charged with assault.

TMZ reported that an alleged fight with a limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up.

The
 driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently 
stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself.

It is claimed that the
 driver swatted his hand away and then it errupted into a full-on smack 
fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times.

He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami.

Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case.

A
 preliminary toxicology report released Thursday showed that he tested 
positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax.

Bieber told Florida
police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken
 a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication.

False alarm: A police search found nothing suspicious and the popstar and his pals were free to go, however, the FAA launched an investigation into their actions, which today came back with all parties being cleared of any wrongdoing

His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday.

Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption.

'I
 have the greatest Dad in the world. He's taught me how to love, learn, 
and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my 
superhero,' he wrote on Instagram.

In
 California, the singer remains under investigation for an egg-tossing 
incident that left his neighbor's house with thousands of dollars in 
damage.

If Bieber is charged in that case, a California judge may look 
at him more harshly in light of the Florida and Toronto cases, said Stan
 Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.

Bieber
 has not addressed the vandalism claim in California, and his attorney 
Howard Weitzman has said the singer's legal team believes their client 
is innocent in the Toronto case.
