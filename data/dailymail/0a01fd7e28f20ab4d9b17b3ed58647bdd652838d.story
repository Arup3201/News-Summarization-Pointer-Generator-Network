Imagine turning up for a five-day survival course in the Scottish Highlands and finding a man known as ‘Psycho’ staring back at you.

Stuart Pearce can just about see the funny side of his outward bound experience last October, just one part of a diverse football sabbatical that has taken the former England Under 21 manager from Cape Verde to the Canadian Rockies.

He will return to the game full-time on July 1, as the manager of Nottingham Forest, and looks considerably refreshed and energised, even after a morning coaching children at a school near Upton Park in east London.

Ready: Stuart Pearce cannot wait to take over as manager at Nottingham Forest

Direction: Pearce (left) managed England U21s and was a coach with the England senior side too

‘We just pitched up for five days in the wilds of Scotland last October with two ex-Marines,’ says Pearce. ‘It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. We learned survival skills, shelter-building, skinning hares.

‘To be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew (of me).

There was a fella from Dublin, one from Southampton, myself, an ex-Marine from Alaska, a policewoman from Melbourne and a Chinese fella from the tourism industry. 

‘Within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night. It was great fun.’ 

Pearce had booked the course the previous January, knowing his six years as England Under 21 manager would come to an end after the European Championships that summer. But any suggestion his time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly, if politely, dismissed.

There has been no great spiritual awakening over the past year for this straight-forward former left back, only an opportunity to indulge his love of traveling, theatre and live gigs.

Selection: If Wayne Rooney is out of form and unfit then Pearce does not think he should be selected

Dropped: Pearce says he would not have played Rooney at the 2010 World Cup as he was out of form

‘Did I learn anything about myself? Not really,’ he says. ‘You’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating. That’s it.’ 

It is the same no-nonsense approach that has characterised Pearce as a player, coach and manager.

He has already told his Forest staff to forget the ‘sleeping giant’ tag that suggests the club has some God-given right to win promotion to the Premier League owing to its illustrious past.

‘I hate it,’ he says.

The same approach underpins Pearce’s response to being asked if the debate about whether Wayne Rooney should start for England is justified.

‘I think he should be treated as I always have done with every player in my care,’ he says.

‘I went to the U21 tournament in 2011, had to convince Theo Walcott to go, convince Arsene Wenger to let me have Walcott and then his form wasn’t good enough so I left him out after the first game. Theo’s in tears about it, but I’ve got no duty to pick him when Adam Johnson’s playing so well.

Youth: Pearce hopes that Roy Hodgson (right) plays the youngsters like Raheem Sterling (left)

Progress: He thinks that players such as Luke Shaw will not learn from just being taken for the 'experience'

‘In 2010 Wayne should have been left out of the team because his form was so poor, but Capello kept him in the team.

'This is England. Even at club level, I’ve always had a mentality of no matter who you are, you can go in and out of the team.

‘Brian Clough was a great master for us. You knew straight away he would put you out of the team as an example to the rest of the group if your standards dropped.’ 

‘Quarter-finals’ is Pearce’s blunt assessment of England’s chances in Brazil, while the suggestion Roy Hodgson’s squad might get cabin fever, or struggle to be away from home, is also given short shrift.

‘Every time I hear a player say “we didn’t have this or that” I’m embarrassed for my profession, if I’m being honest with you,’ says Pearce, capped 78 times by England.

‘It just shows a total lack of imagination and IQ, probably.

‘You’re there to do a job at, arguably, the greatest moment in your life. I was an international for 12 years and I played at one World Cup Finals (in 1990). That shows you everyone should grasp it with both hands.’

Raw: Players such as Ross Barkley (right) need game time at the World Cup or at youth level tournaments

Pearce’s passion for wearing the England shirt has never been questioned, but his gripe is that young, exciting and talented players such as Luke Shaw and Ross Barkley have been promoted to the senior side before their time.

It might seem a perverse approach from a former Under 21 boss, but Pearce’s mantra has been consistent: English players should serve apprenticeships at Under 17, Under 19 and Under 21 level in order to make the senior side more successful.

He would therefore have picked Ashley Cole - ‘the best left back England have ever had’ - ahead of Shaw.

He calls his six years with the FA ‘brilliant’ but admits the ‘politics’ - those annual battles with Premier League managers in a bid to select the best players - were ‘a slight frustration’.

That feels like Pearce is, for once, treading carefully, given the considered argument that follows.

‘If Luke Shaw comes back from this World Cup having not kicked a ball I would have said it was a wasted adventure for him,’ he says.

‘I think he would have been better going to the Toulon Tournament (with England’s Under 20 side) and playing in the Under 21 qualifier. That’s where we miss a trick time and time again.

Psycho: Pearce was nicknamed 'psycho' or his tough-tackling and no-nonsense approach

Seasoned pro: Pearce was capped 78 times by his country and played at major tournaments

‘I think we’ve got a lot of players in the England squad who I’m not sure will deliver - and that’s for good and for bad. I’ve just got my fingers crossed they play minutes. 

‘Too many of our young players keep missing tournaments. It’s a sad thing. It’s not a duty of care to our best players who, in the thin pool that we have, have to play 90 minutes in every international get-together.

‘Their clubs give them a ready-made excuse to get out of the younger age groups, saying they’ve grown out of it; the agents don’t want their players playing and then there’s the egos of the players themselves. They don’t want it.

‘All we do is strip down bare our pool of talent, then leave them in the stand and not let them play football. We try to build the roof first and it won’t work.’ 

‘Psycho’, after all, knows all about surviving in the wild these days.
