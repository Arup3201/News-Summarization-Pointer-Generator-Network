Police in North Carolina say they will not bring any charges against a 14-year-old boy who shot an intruder three times, killing him, believing the teen was protecting his home and his sick grandmother inside.

The boy, whose father was murdered during a robbery at his auto shop six years ago, was looking after his his grandmother in Mint Hill, near Charlotte, on Tuesday after she recently underwent a hip replacement.

The teen, who was sick with bronchitis, was fixing something for his grandmother in the kitchen about 5pm when he heard a window break at the back of the home.

Two men - later identified as brothers Isai Delcid, 18, and Carlos Delcid, 22 - were trying to get into the house, police said.

Scene: The attempted break-in occurred at this home in Mint Hill, just outside of Charlotte, on Tuesday night

Smashed: This is the window of the house the burglars broke and tried to climb through

Evidence: Police marked a piece a wood on the balcony where a bullet was lodged in the shooting

Proud: George Wyant, the 14-year-old's grandfather, said he is grateful his wife not alone in the house

The boy then ran and grabbed a loaded Glock pistol he knew his grandfather kept for protection.

He fired three times at the window, killing Isai Delcid.

Shot dead: Isai Delcid, 18, was killed by the teen as he attempted to break into the house

The man is believed to have been outside the home when he was shot.

His brother then fled the scene.

Moments later the grandmother, Anna Marie Wyant, 73, called 911.

'The man was breaking into the window,' she told the operator, according to The Charlotte Observer.

'He was halfway in the window. 

'My grandson told him to stop and get out of here and he didn't so my grandson shot him.

'Somebody just broke in the house and we shot him.'

Police who arrived at the scene found the body of Isai Delcid at the back of the house.

Carlos Delcid was arrested nearby and has been charged first-degree burglary.

The boy's grandfather, George Wyant, said while the situation was unfortunate, he is glad his grandson was home at the time of the attempted break-in and that his wife was not alone.

'Who knows what could have happened,' he told The Observer.

Wyant said the boy was familiar with guns. 

'I took him to a shooting range,' he said. 

Investigation: A huge police presence can be seen at the home on Rolling Fields Road on Tuesday

Police: Investigators check out the scene as they prepare to remove the body from the back of the home

'All the boys, I wanted them to learn gun safety. 

'That's what all of us should have for protection. 

'These are different ages, and you have to protect yourself.'

Sadly the family are no strangers to tragedy.

In April, 2008, the Wyants' son-in-law and the 14-year-old's father, Gregorio 'Greg' Hernandez, was shot to death at his automotive shop. 

'He was a mechanic,' George Wyant said. 

'It was his garage. Someone came in and shot him to death.'

Two years later, a jury found Victor Vasquez guilty of first-degree murder for the killing.

Vasquez was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 

Another man, Alfonzo Caballero, pleaded guilty in connection with the crime.
