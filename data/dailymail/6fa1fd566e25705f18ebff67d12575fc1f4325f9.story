Buckingham Palace officials were criticised last night for leaving 25 windows open in the historic building during one of the coldest days of the year. 

The windows at the front of the palace were photographed in an open position as controversy raged over the decision to fly the union flag at half mast following the death of King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia.

It is understood that it costs in the region of £1.1 million a year to heat the palace.

Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers' Alliance said leaving windows open on a cold day is akin to burning cash in a fire. 

The temperature on the day plummeted to -3 Celsius.  

He told The Sun: 'Closing windows on cold days is just common sense. Taxpayers don't have bottomless pockets. ' 

A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said some of the windows on the top floor were left open during redecorating and maintenance work. 

The union flag was flown at half mast at Buckingham Palace and at several public buildings to commemorate the passing of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. 

However, flags in Saudi Arabia were not lowered as a result of their monarch's death.
