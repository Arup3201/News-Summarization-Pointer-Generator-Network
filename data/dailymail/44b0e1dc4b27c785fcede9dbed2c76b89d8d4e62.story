The three bungling Iranian bombers detained in Bangkok after they accidentally set off their explosives cavorted with prostitutes at a beach resort days before the botched attacks.

A photograph has emerged of the trio cosying up to sex workers, surrounded by hookah-pipes and drinks, in a bar in the notoriously sleazy city of Pattaya.

The revelation comes as it emerged police are now hunting for two more suspects, including a possible bomb expert, they think helped the trio as they set about targeting Israeli diplomats.

The foiled plan was discovered on Tuesday when explosives in the men's rented house blew up by mistake, forcing them to flee.

Two men, including one who blew off 
his own leg when he hurled a grenade at police but it bounced back at 
his feet, were detained in the Thai capital.

A third was captured the following day in Malaysia as he tried to return to Iran.

After
 flying into the southern city of Phuket on February 8, the men moved to
 Pattaya, 45 miles southeast of the capital, and stayed there for at 
least two nights before heading to Bangkok.

It was there that the group met with prostitutes, one of which was brought to Bangkok to identify the suspects yesterday.

A mobile phone image taken by one of the women, published by the Bangkok Post, purportedly shows the three Iranians at a Middle Eastern bar or restaurant.

They appear to be surrounded by hookah water-pipes, two of them cradling women in their arms, the men posing for a photo around a low, drink-filled table on which there appeared to be at least one bottle of beer.

The woman who took the photograph said one of the now-detained suspects, Mohammad Kharzei, had asked her to escort him 'because he was not good at speaking English'.

She said she brought two companions for Kharzei's friends, and they had drinks and played snooker together.

The woman detected nothing awry, except when one of the Iranians 'barred her from approaching a closet' in his hotel room.

The botched plot has ratcheted up tensions between Iran and Israel, which is accusing Iran of waging a covert campaign of state terror that included a bombing Monday in New Delhi that tore through an Israeli diplomatic vehicle, wounding an Israeli diplomat's wife and driver, and a failed bomb attempt the same day in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.

Iran has denied responsibility for all three bomb plots, and blames the Jewish state for the recent killings of Iranian atomic scientists.

Thailand's national police chief said yesterday that the detained Iranians were plotting to attack Israeli diplomats, citing the similarity of so-called 'sticky' bombs that can be attached magnetically that were used in New Delhi and Tbilisi.

Today, Bangkok police commissioner Lt Gen Winai Thongsong announced authorities were searching for two more suspects in the case.

This included one man who was seen early on Tuesday on CCTV footage as he left the same house where the accidental explosion later took place.

Destruction: Saeid Moradi lies on the ground, by a telephone box, after his legs were seriously wounded in the blast

Police said the man was seen leaving the residence with a bag in his hand, and had been coming and going repeatedly in the days prior to that.

The same cameras captured each of the three Iranian men leaving the residence shortly after an explosion ripped the roof of the house that afternoon.

Winai said the newest suspect was 52, and of Middle Eastern descent, but gave no other details and did not give his nationality.

He said police also are looking for an additional suspect who had rented the destroyed home with an Iranian woman named Leila Rohani who is now believed to be back in Tehran.

Besides Kharzei, the two other detained suspects are Saeid Moradi, whose leg was sheared off by explosives he was carrying on a busy Bangkok street as he tried to flee, and Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, who was arrested in Malaysia and was trying to return to Iran.
