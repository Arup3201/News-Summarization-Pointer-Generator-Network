The parents of a former Marine who was kidnapped in Syria over two years ago want more information from the Obama administration.

Marc and Debra Tice said that they have been given little to no information about their son, photojournalist Austin Tice, since he disappeared near Damascus in August 2012, and that they believe all information should be made available to them.

This just days after they said that the White House has been 'exquisitely horrible' about communicating with them.

'We feel certain that there's more information that could be shared with us. It's not shared with us because we don't have the appropriate clearances, and we're not vetted,' said Mrs. Tice, appearing with her husband on The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson on Friday. 

'I said this before, I feel like God vetted us when he gave us this man for our son. I think that all the information available should be available to us.'

Mr. Tice then noted that while the two have been in communication with the White House, he believes that the 'content could be deeper.'

Tice was in Syria reporting for the McClatchy News, the Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets when he was kidnapped.

It is still uncertain who took the man as no groups have come forward to take credit.

Footage of a man who appeared to be Tice did surface in September 2012, just a month after his capture, and showed a man being led up a rocky hillside while blindfolded, looking exhausted as he made statements in broken Arabic.

'We feel certain that there's more information that could be shared with us. It's not shared with us because we don't have the appropriate clearances, and we're not vetted,' said Mrs. Tice about her son (above)

This as Obama has recently promised to do more to help the families of individuals who have been taken overseas

The Tices recent media push, a far cry from the low profile approach adopted by most parents of individuals who have been kidnapped overseas, comes as President Obama has pledged to do everything he can to help these families in the wake of the death of 26-year-old kidnapping victim Kayla Mueller who was taken by ISIS in August 2013.

She was reportedly killed by a Jordanian airstrike  against the terrorist organization.

'It's as tough as anything that I do -- having conversations with parents who understandably want, by any means necessary, for their children to be safe,' said Obama in a speech this week.

'We will do everything we can short of providing an incentive for future Americans to be caught.'
