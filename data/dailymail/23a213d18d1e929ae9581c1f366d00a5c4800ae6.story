Caring: Shannon was a 'loving and absolutely fantastic daughter'

A teenager who had been prescribed a contraceptive pill to clear up her acne died after suffering a blood clot, an inquest heard yesterday.

Hours before her death, Shannon Deakin, 16, had gone to an out-of-hours surgery with ‘knife-like’ pains in her thigh.

She saw a newly-qualified locum GP, Dr Karim Mohammed, who excluded deep vein thrombosis as a cause and gave her antibiotics instead. He told Shannon to see her family doctor within two days if she wasn’t feeling better, but she died 12 hours later.

An inquest was told the midwifery student had been prescribed the oral contraceptive Dianette by her GP. The pill is known to carry a higher risk of developing blood clots compared to similar pills.

Shannon had been taking the Pill for a month before coming off it four weeks before she died on December 4 last year.

A post-mortem examination showed she died from a pulmonary embolism caused by a blood clot moving from her leg to her chest, which the pathologist described as ‘extremely rare’.

Consultant haematologist Dr Rhona Maclean told the hearing that the risk of Shannon developing a thrombosis from taking  Dianette was ‘very low’.

But she said: ‘It would be at its highest in the first six months of taking the Pill.’

During the month Shannon was taking Dianette, the risk of having a thrombosis was estimated to be ‘15 to 25 in every 100,000’.

Her GP had prescribed the Pill after the teenager complained of acne on her back, chest and face.

The inquest at Sheffield was told Dr Mohammed was on call at the walk-in clinic in Barnsley Hospital when Shannon came in complaining of pain from her abdomen to her groin.

Dianette: Women taking a contraceptive pill are more likely to develop blood clots

Because she had been on the Pill for only a short time, he did not ask any further questions and excluded DVT from his diagnosis. ‘I explained it was highly unlikely that it was a clot and my findings were more of an infection or muscular pain,’ he said.

Shannon later collapsed on the sofa of her home in Hoyland, South Yorkshire. Her father Bryan, 58, tried to revive her but she was declared dead in hospital. Her mother, Susan, 43, said: ‘She was a very caring person, very  outgoing, loving, an absolutely  fantastic daughter and had such generosity towards everyone else.

‘She wanted a career as a midwife and wanted children. You couldn’t ask for a better daughter.’

Dr James Gray, who carried  out an independent review, said because Shannon had been off the Pill for four weeks the risk associated with Dianette was likely to  be ‘very small’.

He said: ‘It is known to be slightly higher risk than other pills, but in Shannon’s case we have no known risk factors.’

Commenting on the locum doctor’s treatment, he said: ‘It may have been prudent to arrange a scan that day but I do not believe the overall assessment was in itself unreasonable.’

Asked if he had taken into account all known risk factors for DVT, Dr Gray replied: ‘I remain unconvinced that is the case.’

The hearing continues.

Risks: Women are more at risk of a blood clot if they smoke, are overweight or have diabetes

Dianette, which has the medical name cyproterone acetate, works by suppressing the action of testosterone on the body's tissues.It is also used as a hormone therapy in men undergoing sex change treatment, as well as in tackling early onset puberty. 

The NHS website said Dianette is only used to treat acne when previous treatments have not been successful.

Women are more at risk of a blot clot if they smoke, have polycystic ovary syndrome, are seriously overweight, recently had a baby, have high blood pressure or diabetes or conditions such as Crohn's disease.

The NHS warns women taking the pill to be wary of signs including migraines for the first time, pain or swelling in legs, stabbing pain when they breathe, pain in the chest or sudden changes to eyesight or hearing.
