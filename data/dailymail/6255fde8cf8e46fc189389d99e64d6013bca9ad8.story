Lewis Hamilton not only lengthened the gap between him and Nico Rosberg after winning the Russian Grand Prix, he has also equalled a British record.

Nigel Mansell secured his 31st race win in Australia 20 years ago, a feat which no man has looked close to breaking.

But after taking the chequered flag in Sochi, Hamilton has pulled level with the 1992 world champion, and will expect to break the record before the end of the season.

The 29-year-old is now 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, and realistically one more race win should see him take the drivers' championship for the second time.

Hamilton's first race win came in just his sixth race in Formula One at the Canadian Grand Prix, and he ended the 2007 season with four victories.

Five would follow in 2008, two in 2009, three in 2010 and 2011, four in 2012, one in 2013 and EIGHT so far this season.

His win in Russia was also his fourth in succession, and no driver has failed to win the championship after achieving that feat.
