Over 500 Amtrak passengers stranded on three trains in the snow for up to 14 hours, some with blocked toilets and flooded bathrooms, are finally heading to Chicago, officials said on Tuesday.

Travelers were stuck overnight from Monday afternoon, after huge snow drifts engulfed train engines in northern Illinois. Grim passengers posted pictures, complaints and pleas for help online.

California resident Laurette Mosley told ABC News that she had been stuck on one of the trains for more than 14 hours. She was traveling to Chicago for her mother's funeral.

'The bathrooms are flooded. The sinks are full with water and the toilets are flooded,' she explained.

'The conditions are cold, we're wearing coats. And my husband is a diabetic. He hasn't had any food all day,' Mosley told ABC.

About 300 passengers on two trains that were stuck near Mendota, about 80 miles from Chicago, boarded buses in Princeton for the final leg of their trip on Tuesday, said an Amtrak spokesman.

They eventually arrived around mid-morning in Chicago.

A third train loaded with 217 people spent the night at a BNSF rail yard in Galesburg. They were expected to take buses or another form of transport for the final 150 miles to Chicago.

The passengers took to their cellphones to take pictures of the unpleasant conditions onboard, communicate with the outside world and keep entertained.

Trouble: Passengers posted pictures, complaints and pleas for help online

Keeping warm: Over 500 passengers were delayed overnight

Grin: On Instagram, one man posted a photo of his glum expression with the caption: 'Nothing brings a smile to my face more than being stranded 11 hours on an Amtrak'

Genuine: When he was finally rescued the Instagram user posted this photo, with the caption: 'This is the highlight of my adult life'

End of the line: Some of the 500 travelers who got stuck on three trains finally reach Chicago

Some travelers complained about a lack of updates from status updates from Amtrak while other passengers said the rail company was doing as much as it could.

On Instagram, a user with the name iamaplummer posted a photo of his glum expression with the 
caption: 'Nothing brings a smile to my face more than being stranded 11 
hours on an Amtrak.'

Earlier he wrote that he had been stuck on the train for eight hours and that the snow drifts were taller than he was.

'My tolerance is running dry for the loud and obnoxious passengers,' he continued.

But the saga finally ended in relied for iamaplummer. When he eventually left the train he posted a photo of his genuine smile, with the caption: 'This is highlight of my adult life.

'I've been awake for almost 24 hours and am #hungry, #exhausted, #frustrated, #annoyed, and most of all HAPPY TO BE SAFE,' iamaplummer added.Â 

Off the train: The man posted a photo from the coach that would eventually take him to Chicago

'It's OVER!': Imaplummer took this photo at Chicago's Union Station at the end of his epic ordeal

Snowy scene: The trains were stranded in freezing conditions in rural Illinois

Destination: Robert Johnson, of Woodbridge, Viginia, finally arrived at Union Station after his Amtrak train from Los Angeles became stuck in snow drifts

He then posted a photo from his coach
 ride to Chicago. Then around 11am on Tuesday the exhausted traveler put
 up a picture of the Windy City's Union Station with the words: 'It's 
OVER.'

The trains - The
 Southwest Chief from Los Angeles, the Illinois Zephyr from Quincy and 
the California Zephyr from the San Francisco Bay area - got stuck after 3
 p.m. Monday in blowing, drifting snow and ice that made the tracks 
impassable.

Passengers spent the night sleeping and eating while emergency workers were on standby. Train crews handed out food and prepared for any medical issues, but authorities said there were none.

'There was no good reason to take people out of warm trains ... into the cold,' Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari. 'We sheltered them in place.'

Amtrak canceled nearly two dozen trains in Illinois on Tuesday because of the cold and lingering snow from a weekend storm that dumped more than a foot of snow in some areas of Illinois.

Magliari said crews were clearing tracks and hoped to resume operations Wednesday.

Resolution: All passengers were expected to arrive in Chicago by Tuesday morning

Exhausted: Weary passengers finally unload their suitcases after spending a night on a stranded Amtrak train

Big freeze: The rare polar vortex phenomenon brought record lows to much of the U.S.
