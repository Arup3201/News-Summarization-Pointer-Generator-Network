President Obama has lauded the slain U.S. ambassador to Libya, John Christopher Stevens, as a 'courageous role model' who 'died in a city a city that he helped save'.

Stevens, the first U.S. ambassador to be killed by terrorism in 33 years, was a career diplomat devoted to bringing democracy to the Middle East when he was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi.

In a heartbreaking twist, Stevens was struck down in a rocket attack on Tuesday by forces unleashed after Muammar Gaddafi's power crumbled - an uprising the ambassador had strongly supported.

He was killed alongside three other U.S. officials, including Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, a ten-year veteran of the State Department, a husband and a father of two.

Killed: The U.S. ambassador to Libya, John Christopher Stevens, who went simply by Chris Stevens, was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi after a 20-year career in the foreign service

Stevens, who went by the first name Chris, had only been appointed as Libyan
 ambassador by President Obama in January. It came after an esteemed 
career within the United States foreign service which spanned more than two 
decades.

Speaking outside the White House on Wednesday, Obama hailed him Stevens and the three other U.S. officials who died in the attack as devoted to working for democracy.

'It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi as it's a city that he helped to save,' Obama said.

With 'characteristic skill, courage and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyans... and he worked tirelessly to support this young democracy.

'He was a role model to those who worked with him and to the young diplomats who strive to follow in his footsteps.'

He added: 'These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. We grieve with their families but let us carry on their memory... I have no doubt that their legacy will live on.'

Loss: Hillary Clinton swore Mr Stevens in to his role earlier this year and called him 'eloquent and passionate'

'They exemplified America's 
commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people 
around the globe, and stand in stark contrast to those who callously 
took their lives,' he said.

John Christopher Stevens was killed 
in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi by protesters angry over
 a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad.

According to the State Department Office of the Historian, just five U.S. ambassadors have been killed by terrorists:

Two other U.S. ambassadors have died in plane crashes:

'Chris
 was a courageous and exemplary representative of the United States. 
Throughout the Libyan revolution, he selflessly served our country and 
the Libyan people at our mission in Benghazi.

'His legacy will endure wherever 
human beings reach for liberty and justice. I am profoundly grateful for
 his service to my Administration, and deeply saddened by this loss.'

Stevens,
 52, was born in April 1960 and raised in California, where he stayed 
for his undergraduate degree at the University of Berkeley, before he 
graduated in 1982.

In an introductory video for his role as
 ambassador, Stevens admitted he did not know much about the Middle East
 until he travelled to Morocco in 1983.

There, he worked as a Peace Corps Volunteer for two years, teaching English in the mountains - and 'quickly grew to love this part of the world'.

When he returned to the United States, he graduated from the University of California's Hastings College of Law in 1989.

After working in international trade law in Washington D.C. for two years, he joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1991.

Stevens spoke French and Arabic, which led to a series of postings throughout the Middle East, including in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Israel.

Younger years: Mr Stevens grew up in California and graduated from the UC Berkeley in 1982

Calling: After graduating, he taught English in Morocco for two years and 'grew to love this part of the world'

Service: Mr Stevens was posted throughout the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Israel

Devoted: Mr Stevens said he was looking forward to a stronger relationship between Libya and the U.S

In 1996, he was appointed staff 
assistant in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department 
in Washington and special assistant to the under secretary for political
 affairs.

By May 2007, he had also served as a staff adviser on Middle East affairs to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

His first posting to Libya came in June 2007 as a deputy chief of mission. Two years later, he became the chargé d'affaires at the embassy in Tripoli.

His second tour in Libya came in 
April 2011, when he served as special representative to the Libyan 
Transitional National Council and was sent to rebel headquarters in 
Benghazi, so he could better understand the different factions fighting 
against Gaddafi.

The journey meant Stevens was the highest-ranking US representative to travel to Libya since the uprising began.

In his introductory video, Stevens 
expressed his passion to help the people of Libya, saying he was looking
 forward to a stronger relationship between the country and the U.S., as
 it used to enjoy.

'I had the honour to serve as the US 
envoy to the Libyan opposition during the revolution, was thrilled to 
watch the Libyan people demand their rights,' he said. 'Now I am excited to return to Libya to continue the great work we started.'

He was appointed as ambassador in January and arrived in Tripoli in May 2012 to take up the role.

'Libyans are going through difficult times, 
challenges,' he said in the video. 'I want peace in this part of the world.'

His biography in the US Department 
of State website reads: 'As the President’s representative, his job is 
to develop a strong, mutually beneficial relationship between the United
 States and Libya.'

He leaves behind family in north California, CNN reported, adding that they were elderly.

In a statement, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who swore Stevens in for his post earlier this year, said: 'He spoke 
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the 
Libyan people.

Welcoming: Mr Stevens is pictured with Arizona Senator John McCain, who visited Tripoli two months ago

Friends: Senator McCain posted this picture to Twitter in July, adding: 'Chris Stevens - one of America's finest diplomats also makes one of the best cappuccinos in Tripoli'

Experience: Ambassador Stevens, who joined the foreign service in 1991, had been on two tours of Libya ahead of his role

'As the conflict in Libya unfolded, 
Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He 
risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build 
the foundation for a new, free nation.

'He spent every day since helping to 
finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing 
America’s values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in 
danger.'

She called Smith, who also died in the attacks, 'one of our best'.

Smith, a married father-of-two, joined the State Department ten years ago. Before arriving in Benghazi, he had served in Baghdad, Pretoria, Montreal and at The Hague.

The gaming community claims that Smith was an avid player of the game 'Eve Online', and went by the name 'Vile Rat'. The community has posted tributes mourning the loss of their friend.

His friend of six years, named as Mittani, wrote: 'We knew he was in Benghazi. He commented on how there was a constant susurrus of weaponry in the background. He was in situ to provide IT services for the consulate, which meant he was on the net all the time, hanging out with us.'

Mittani, who said his friend used diplomacy as a tool in online games, claimed that Smith typed 'F***' and 'GUNFIRE' before losing his connection on Tuesday.

'I’m clearly in shock... and I feel kind of dead inside,' Mittani wrote. 'Sean was a great guy.'

The men died after an attack by militia on the US
 consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi on Tuesday. The two others killed have not been named as officials are contacting their families.

They were killed in a protest over an American-produced film that protestors claim 
insults the Prophet Muhammad.
