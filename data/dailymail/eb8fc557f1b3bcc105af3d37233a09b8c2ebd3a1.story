Things you never expect to see: A Brazilian bartender asking a customer whether it’s five or six. To the opposition.

At the time it was just five. To Germany. Later on, it was indeed six. Then seven and – as Mesut Ozil broke clear in the final minute – it could have been more.

This was humiliation on an epic scale. To those watching in the bar on the corner of fashionable Paulista Avenue here in Sao Paulo on Tuesday night it signalled the end of a dream that – against their better judgement – they had started to believe in.

They had paid 100 reais to get in, 90 for the women. That’s about £30. Or slightly less, depending on gender. You got free beer for that but everybody had come for the football.

Over the last few weeks here in Brazil, a public initially sceptical about this World Cup and their team’s chances had allowed itself to be swept along.

On Tuesday night, though, it didn’t take long for Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team to show themselves for what they really are. By half-time, most people in this particular establishment had gone back to their food and their free bar. Outside under an awning a couple of musicians had begun to warm up.

The warning signs had been there from the start, of course. The first goal of this tournament was an own goal, scored by a Brazilian. That day here in Sao Paulo, the home team needed a leg up from a referee to get by against Croatia.

The problem with momentum and emotion, though, is that it clouds issues. Realities of life and sport get forgotten and that’s a good thing. It allows you to feel and think things that really aren’t logical. And that is how it has been here.

How the media reacted: Meia Hora's front page says 'Will Not Cover', 
seeking to ignore any mention of the embarrassment (and says how another 
goal was scored by Germany while they were editing it), while Lance list
 a few words of feeling; Pain, Indignation and Revolt and Shame amongst
 them

Overreaction: Brazil were looking backwards at Neymar's injury, not forwards to the game

I saw Brazil play their second group games against Mexico – a goalless draw – and Cameroon – a 4-1 win – and it was clear on both occasions that this was a Brazilian team carrying deeper flaws than perhaps any in the nation’s history.

Even in beating Cameroon – just about the weakest team in the competition – Brazil looked uncomfortable. Across the back, they were awful. And that was with Thiago Silva – suspended for the Germany clash – in the team.

Rescued by Neymar on that occasion, I suggested in my match report that Brazil would run in to a hiding before long. The only surprise is that it took so long and that – when it came – it was so big.

Certainly, Brazil provided us with a story we were happy to buy and the country with something to cling to. You only had to look down the squad list, though, to see where the problems lay.

Fred, Hulk, Jo, Maicon. These are players that would not get many games between them in the Barclays Premier League. Some have tried, and failed. This, remember, was a World Cup.

Heaven knows what players like Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho and Manchester United’s Rafael da Silva have done to upset Scolari but certainly they should have been in his 23, if not necessarily his starting XI.

Perhaps Scolari knew what was coming after the scrappy penalty shootout victory over Chile.

The Chileans hit the crossbar in extra time that day and maybe the coach sensed then – if he hadn’t before – that his squad wasn’t good enough.

Certainly the manner in which they subsequently hacked Colombia off the field in the last eight – and the faux commiserations that followed from the likes of David Luiz – were depressing.

The nation, however, was almost delirious by then. Such was the hysteria about Neymar’s injury that the build up to Tuesday’s game was spent with millions of people looking backwards, rather than forwards. Perhaps Scolari and his players did, too.

Against Germany they certainly played 
as though they hadn’t prepared. Even Neymar, Pele, Zico and Socrates 
between them wouldn’t have stopped this happening.

Those
 in yellow looked bereft with only half an hour gone and a nation felt 
their pain. None of these players earn a living in Brazil.

As such, it 
will be a while before their public get to see them in a match that 
matters again.

Maybe that is
 part of the problem. Maybe there are too many young Brazilians hidden 
in talent factories in Russia and the Ukraine now for their love for the
 yellow shirt to stay strong.

What happened in Belo Horizonte, though, wasn’t above love or passion or desire. If there was ever a case of a team wanting something too much, then perhaps this was it.

Whatever the case, a dream is over and the humdrum beckons once again here.

In my bar in Sao Paulo, the barman had only one thing left to wish for.

'Come on Holland,' he said.
