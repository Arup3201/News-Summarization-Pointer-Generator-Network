More than £150,000 of taxpayers’ money has been spent on four traffic-blocking bollards - that cars can drive around.

Councillors installed the new rising posts in Gloucester in a bid to promote a ‘cafe culture’, but they have already impaled a police car and been blamed for a downturn in trade by shopkeepers.

The posts, which operate between 10am and 5pm every day, have been installed in the city centre on four ‘gate’ streets to keep vehicles out of the pedestrian area.

But city councillor Sebastian Field said he saw a car getting past one of the bollards, telling a meeting: ‘It was going at quite a speed and it wasn’t too tight. This needs to be sorted out.’

Traders have also voiced concerns about emergency vehicles being delayed by the bollards - which have been jointly funded at a cost of £157,000 by the local city and county councils.

And last week a police car entering the zone in pursuit of a shoplifter was impaled on one of the bollards, which suddenly rose up beneath it.

City council leader Paul James admitted there were ‘teething problems’ with the system, but claimed it would bring value in the long term.

He added: ‘I imagine it must have been pretty tight for any car to pass through but we must report it to highways to address the issue. Of course we want the system to work properly.’

Vernon Smith, cabinet member for highways and floods at the county council, said that planters either side of the bollards would be moved to reduce the gap.

‘It’s been illegal since the Nineties to drive on the gate streets between 10am and 5pm, and the police can enforce against any vehicles which are there when they shouldn’t be.’

The bollards, which began working on March 2, were installed following pedestrian safety concerns.
