A rocket launcher and warhead have been discovered by police investigating dissident republicans.

Officers made the dramatic find while searching a house on Hawthorn Street, West Belfast, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland said that the launcher and warhead were intended to kill.

A police spokesman said: ‘These weapon systems are clearly intended to kill and we should be in no doubt that the recovery of these items has saved lives.’

Today officers in Great Britain 
expressed concern about helping police at the G8 this summer in Northern
Ireland because of the danger.

PSNI chief constable Matt Baggott has warned he needs more officers to cope with the security threat and other unrest.

Earlier this month Irish police intercepted a suspected dissident republican haul of rocket launchers and explosives in Co Tipperary which were believed to be en route to Northern Ireland.
