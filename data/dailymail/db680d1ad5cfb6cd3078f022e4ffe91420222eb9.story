Hundred of thousands of revellers are set to swarm the streets of West London this afternoon with Caribbean-style sunshine expected for the second day of the Notting Hill Carnival.

The event, which is Europe's largest street party, kicked off yesterday with an explosion of music and brightly-coloured costumes on display during the opening Children's Day parades.

And the volume is due to be ramped up even higher for Adults' Day today with dozens of enormous sound systems wiring up their speakers to blast Reggae, Dancehall, Calypso and Hip Hop music to the thronging crowds.

More than one million people are expected to enjoy this year's Notting Hill Carnival. It is the largest street festival in Europe and was first held in 1964

Many of the 40 sound systems are expected to reach levels of well over 100dB, with some even expected to hit 140dB, louder than a jet engine, so ear plugs are advised.

After fears the start of Europe's 
biggest street festival would be hampered by rain, the skies cleared yesterday and
the sun shone on performers as they paraded through the streets of west
London in bright costumes.

The event got off largely trouble free although Ambulance services say they had to treat around 300 people for cuts and bruises to the feet and alcohol-related injuries. Police made around 70 arrests mainly for drug offences.

Up to one million people are expected to attend the Carnival to experience Caribbean culture, food, music and dance.

Thumping basslines, sizzling meat and tooting whistles filled the air as giant floats made their way from Westbourne Park Underground station, up Kensal Road, along Ladbroke Grove and down Westbourne Grove.

One of the first groups to take to the streets was the charity Kinetika Bloco, whose dancers wore pink, green and white costumes while a brass band played songs from The Clash's Rock the Casbah to Daft Punk's Get Lucky.

Music is at the heart of Notting Hill Carnival, and both traditional and contemporary sounds fill the air for miles around.

Historically steel bands, Soca and Calypso Music (two forms of music that originated among slaves in Caribbean sugar
plantations) have been at the heart of Carnival but in recent years 
these have been overtaken by the static sound systems playing anything 
from Reggae to R&B, Funk, House, Dub and much more.

Scotland
Yard said police made around 70 arrests - mainly for drugs offences - 
while London Ambulance Service and St John Ambulance treated more than 
300 people for cuts and bruises to their feet and alcohol-related 
injuries. A spokesman said 45 were taken to hospital.

Other arrests were made for assaults on police, public order offences and possession of offensive weapons, Scotland Yard said.

Caribbean street food is also a key 
attraction of the carnival. Visitors can enjoy jerk chicken, rice and 
peas, patties, curries, fried plantain and rum punch as well as the odd 
taste of other exotic cuisines.

On Thursday police arrested 112 people in raids targeting would-be suspects ahead of this weekend's celebrations.

Arrests
for robbery, theft and possession with intent to supply were among 
those made by officers.  They also seized an estimated £4,000 cash under
the Proceeds of Crime Act and a handgun, two imitation firearms and a 
Porsche were also seized.
