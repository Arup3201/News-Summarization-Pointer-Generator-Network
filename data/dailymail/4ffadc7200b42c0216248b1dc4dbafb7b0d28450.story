New York Jets running back Chris Johnson was arrested after officers noticed a firearm in his car when he was pulled over 

New York Jets running back Chris Johnson has been arrested in Florida for carrying a firearm.

The NFL star was pulled over by a patrol car in Orlando, his hometown, on Friday after driving through a stop sign.

The 29-year-old was then arrested after the officer spotted the handle of a weapon in between his feet.

Police spokesperson Sergeant Wanda Ford told ESPN that she wasn't sure if the gun was loaded but it should have been concealed at the time. 

He reportedly has a licence to carry the weapon in the state.

Johnson was booked into a local jail and released on a $250 bond. 

A Jets spokesman released a statement, saying: 'We are aware and have no comment at this time, as this is a pending legal matter.' 

The former Tennessee Titans player, who was released from the franchise last April, signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Jets.

However he could be a victim of the salary cap in the coming weeks.

The Jets have a team option over him, but are unlikely to renew it. 

Johnson is the fifth-leading active rusher in the NFL with 8,628 yards,and one of only seven players to rush for 2,000 yards in a season.

In his first season with the Jets, he recorded only 155 carries, 663 rushing yards and one touchdown.

He is the second Jets player this week to have a run in with the law.

Linebacker Jermaine Cunningham is embroiled in the latest high-profile case of so-called 'revenge porn' after he was charged with sharing explicit photos of a woman.

The Union County prosecutor's office said Cunningham was arrested December 29 in Summit, New Jersey, and charged with invasion of privacy, criminal mischief and unlawful weapons transport.

They allege Cunningham violated a law that forbids disclosing photos or videos without the consent of someone 'whose intimate parts are exposed' or who is engaged in a sex act.
