South Korea is to introduce a blazing fast 5G mobile internet service, quick enough to download a full length feature film in less than a second.

While most of the world has yet to experience the improvements offered by 4G services, the technologically advanced country  has announced a  £900million (1.6 trillion won) in its successor.

South Korea's science ministry said it aims to implement the technology, which is about 1,000 times faster than the 4G, within six years.

Speedy: South Korea are investing £900million into 5G wireless internet services capable of downloading an entire film in a single second

5G will allow users to 
download a 800-megabyte movie file in one second, compared with 40 
seconds using 4G, the science ministry said, adding that such speeds 
would help South Korean firms win overseas deals.

A
 ministry spokesman said: 'We helped fuel national growth with 2G 
services in the 1990s, 3G in the 2000s and 4G around 2010. Now it is 
time to take preemptive action to develop 5G.' 

'Countries
 in Europe, China and the US are making aggressive efforts to develop 5G
 technology ... and we believe there will be fierce competition in this 
market in a few years,' it said.

Under the roadmap, a trial 5G service will be rolled out in 2017 and a fully commercial service in December 2020.

Priority
 will be given to developing key features for the new network, including
 Ultra-HD and hologram transmission as well as cutting-edge social 
networking services.

Related
 industries will be able to rack up sales of 5G-related devices and 
infrastructure equipment worth 331 trillion won from 2020 to 2026, the 
ministry estimated.

The 
government hopes to implement the plan with investment and cooperation 
from operators such as SK Telecom and Korea Telecom as well as handset 
makers like Samsung and LG.

It
 also aims to expand the telecom infrastructure equipment industry, 
which is relatively weaker than the mighty mobile device sector.

Led by Samsung - the world's top handset maker - South Korea has a leading 30-percent stake in the global mobile device market.

'But the (telecom) infrastructure 
equipment industry has only a 4.4 percent share in the global market, 
with exports very limited,' the ministry said.

Chinese
 equipment makers including Huawei have expanded their presence in the 
global market from 12 percent in 2007 to 26 percent in 2012.

Huawei
 announced in November that it was looking at a 5G commercial rollout by
 2020, with a minimum investment of $600 million to develop the 
technology.

Seoul intends 
to take up to a 20 percent stake in the world's telecom infrastructure 
equipment market by 2020, according to the ministry.

New opportunities South Korea is renowned for being at the forefront of internet technology with broadband speeds that consistently out-pace those in Europe or the United States.

Officials said the new service would also mean people on bullet trains running faster than 500 kilometres (310 miles) an hour would even be able to access the Internet, compared with 300 kph currently.

'Bullet trains around the world keep getting faster, with some in China running as fast as 500 and 600 kilometres per hour,' said one ministry official who declined to be named.

'If we have the technology to allow fast Internet access in these trains, it can open new opportunities for us globally,' he said.

Samsung Electronics announced back in May that it had successfully tested 5G technology, managing data transmission of more than one gigabyte per second over a distance of two kilometres.

Samsung said it had found a way to harness millimetre-wave bands which have proved to be a sticking point for the mobile industry to date.

The test used 64 antenna elements, which the tech titan said overcame the issue of 'unfavourable propagation characteristics' that have prevented data travelling across long distances using the bands.

However, it made clear that the technology would not be available commercially before the end of the decade.
