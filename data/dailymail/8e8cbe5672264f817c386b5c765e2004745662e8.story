Despite having four foot fences and scorching temperatures to tackle, Zara Phillips cut a remarkably cool figure as she took to the field during the Brightling Park International Horse Trials in East Sussex.

The Queen's granddaughter, who announced her first pregnancy last week, looked calm and in control as she sped around the course - watched by husband, Mike Tindall.

Although NHS advice states that mothers-to-be should avoid equine sports, Miss Phillips has said that she intends to continue riding for the foreseeable future.

Baby bump: Zara Phillips announced she is three months pregnant with her first child last week

The 32-year-old Olympic silver medallist, who is three months pregnant, fell from a horse only ten days ago, but has vowed to keep on riding until closer to her due date in the New Year.

Her mother, Princess Anne, kept riding until just six weeks before the birth of her daughter and was also a successful eventer.

Eventing includes three stages, dressage, show jumping and cross country, and is one of the toughest horse sports to master.

Zara has entered into another two eventing meetings later this month, on six different horses.

Opinion has been split on whether she should take a break, but Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: 'Many riders continue in the saddle up to five or six months pregnant – and event star Mary King famously competed in the European Championships at five-and-a-half months.

'Zara is a professional sportswoman who will trust her mount and clearly feels safe.'

Zara’s spokesman has said: 'She is being sensible about this and is listening to what doctors are telling her. She would never put her pregnancy in jeopardy.'

Despite her success and her passion for the sport, Zara's love of equine sports doesn't stop at eventing.

The royal is regularly spotted at the
racing and was yesterday pictured playing polo during a charity match 
at Tidworth in Wiltshire.

Between matches, she laughed with husband Mike Tindall, who was later spotted tenderly flinging a protective arm around his pregnant wife's shoulders.
