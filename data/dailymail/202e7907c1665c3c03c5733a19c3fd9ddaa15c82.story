Olive Garden may have run into a problem after its PR stunt on Monday selling a limited number of 'never-ending pasta passes'.

Around 50 cunning buyers have placed the passes on eBay where they are being offered at double, and sometimes three times the price. 

The $100 golden ticket allows carb lovers to fill up on as much of the chain's signature dishes as they can eat. 

Pasta for everyone! Savvy buyers of Olive Garden's 'never-ending-pasta-pass' tried to resell it on eBay 

Fans of the chain were able to buy a ticket to eat as much pasta as possible - along with bread sticks, salad and soup - for seven weeks between September 22 and November 9. 

Bids are being offered for the passes on eBay but none have yet been sold. 

As Daily Finance points out, the small print shows the 'pasta passes' are 'non-transferable and may not be re-sold'.

And it seems that Olive Garden are playing strictly by the rules. 

In a statement to MailOnline today, an Olive Garden spokeswoman said: 'The Never Ending Pasta Passes are personalized and state that they’re non-transferable and not for resale, and we’re working with eBay to make sure buyers and sellers are aware of this. 

'However, hospitality is core to who we are, which is why we’ll work with anyone who’s purchased a pass on eBay to ensure they enjoy Never Ending Pasta Bowl. I’d encourage those guests to reach out to us directly via phone or social media. '

The passes sold out within 45 minutes of being launched at 3pm on Monday.

Only 1,000 of the passes were sold and covered the 150 combinations of pasta and sauce available at Olive Garden.

The deal also includes unlimited soft drinks for the pass-holder and those at their table - but no alcohol.

The pass can be used as many times as the user wants throughout the seven-week period at Olive Garden locations across the U.S.

The attention-grabbing promo comes at a tricky time for the chain. In July, the CEO and Chairman Clarence Otis stepped down as the Darden Restaurants company fights to fix its flagship Olive Garden chain following its contested sale of Red Lobster.

For fans of the Olive Garden chain, getting value for money from the $100 pass should be simple - and done in under a week.

Using only options available on the pass, a dinner of minestrone soup followed by spaghetti meatballs, a house salad and bread, typically costs roughly $36 (before tip).

Even if the pass is used just once a day, then Olive Garden fans can chomp their way through $100, in just 72 hours. 

The company, based in Orlando, Florida, has been pressured to turn around declining sales at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. 

Customers had begun turning away from those chains as they cut back on spending during the recession.

Darden Restaurants Inc. completed the sale of Red Lobster to investment firm Golden Gate Capital in July.

There has also been concern from diners over the calorie contents of those bottomless pasta bowls.  

Olive Garden boasts a significant amount of meals that have more calories, saturated fat and sodium than is recommended - and even more than a McDonald's value meal, according to a Drexel University-University of Pennsylvania study in January.
