Just hours after watching his wife - former ‘Melrose Place’ actress Amy Locane-Bovenizer - get three years in prison for killing a woman in a drunk-driving crash, Mark Bovenizer was involved in his own hit-and-run incident.

Bovenizer, 41, is alleged to have driven his SUV across a lawn near his parent’s home in Hopewell Township, New Jersey, hitting a mailbox and causing $800 worth of property damage.

Hopewell Borough resident Bovenizer then fled the scene without reporting the accident, officials said.

Police said they found Bovenizer's red 2008 Lexus RX 400h at a local repair shop with front-end damage matching the pieces of the vehicle found at the accident scene.

Bovenizer was uncooperative with police and refused to provide a statement, according to the police report. He was not tested for drug or alcohol use.

However Bovenizer’s alleged wrongdoing is nowhere near as serious as his wife’s conviction last November for the 2010 death of Manhattan resident Helene Seeman outside her home in Montgomery.

Locane-Bovenizer's blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit and she was traveling 18 mph above the posted 35 mph speed limit before the crash. Seeman’s husband, Fred, also was seriously injured.

Minutes before the fatal accident, Locane-Bovenizer fled a minor fender-bender and was accused of running over a mailbox during her getaway.

Locane-Bovenizer, 41, was sentenced the minimum three years in prison for second-degree vehicular homicide and third-degree assault by auto.

Fred Seeman yelled, 'What a 
travesty!' at Superior Court Judge Robert Reed immediately after sentencing last month, and he 
and his son stormed out of the courtroom in tears.

Locane-Bovenizer
 had faced up to 10 years in prison after a jury in November convicted 
her of vehicular homicide in the 2010 death of 60-year-old Seeman in 
Montgomery Township.

The 
judge lowered the maximum sentence citing the hardship on 
Locane-Bovenizer's two children, one of whom has suffers from Crohn’s disease and requires a feeding tube, while the other has a mental disability.

Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey D. Soriano is appealing the sentence.

Bovenizer appeared at his wife’s 
sentencing at the Somerset County Courthouse in Somerville on Feb. 14, 
then later that same day his SUV mounted the curb and drove across the 
lawn for 90 feet, crossed the driveway, and drove on 15 feet more of 
lawn before fleeing the scene.

He
 was charged with leaving the scene of an accident involving property 
damage, failure to report an accident, and failure to maintain lane. The
 penalties for a first-time hit-and-run, the most serious of the 
charges, includes a $200 to $400 fine, up to 30 days in jail and 
six-month license suspension.

Bovenizer is scheduled to appear in court on April 9.

 driver causing her to speed and crash into the Seemans' vehicle

Somerset County prosecutors said the 
crash occurred on a dark two-lane road in Montgomery Township in 2010. 
The actress told emergency personnel in the ambulance that she had 
downed four glasses of wine and a beer.

She also was convicted of assault by 
auto and originally faces three to five years in prison on that count. 
Her bail was revoked after the verdict and she has been in jail since 
November.

The mother-of-two is married to liquor store owner Mark Bovenizer.

Locane-Bovenizer appeared in 13 episodes of Melrose Place in the role of Sandy Louise Harling and in movies including Cry-Baby opposite Johnny Depp, School Ties and Secretary.
