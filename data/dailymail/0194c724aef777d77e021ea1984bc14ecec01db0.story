Wojciech Szczesny will discover how far his stock has plummeted in the eyes of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger on Sunday.

The Gunners travel to Brighton for their FA Cup fourth round tie.

Wenger’s usual policy is to play one of his reserve goalkeepers in domestic cup competitions.

Having recently lost his place to David Ospina due to a loss of form and his smoking shame following the defeat at Southampton on New Years Day, the Pole’s position at the Emirates Stadium is under a huge cloud.

Despite the fact Ospina has replaced Szczesny in recent weeks, Wenger has publicly maintained the Poland international remains his ‘No 1’ keeper.

However, there were indications on Saturday that Ospina would be rested for the trip to Brighton - a further hint towards the Colombian now being the club’s first choice - leaving Szczesny and Damien Martinez to battle it out to play against Brighton.

Given Wenger’s penchant for playing his second or third choice keeper in the cup, if Szczesny is involved on Sunday, it would provide a key clue as to where he features in his manager’s thoughts.

Wenger has made the capture of a new No 1 keeper - along with central midfielder - a summer priority.

Fiorentina’s Norberto Neto has been scouted by Gunners spies while Wenger would love to sign Petr Cech but realises Jose Mourinho is unlikely to consider selling the keeper to a direct rival.

And with the No 1 jersey up for grabs, Szczesny’s future at the club could be drawing to a close, with the Pole unlikely to settle for a regular place on the bench next season.

That will almost certainly cement Szczesny's place as reserve goalkeeper
