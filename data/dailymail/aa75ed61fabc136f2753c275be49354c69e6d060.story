A driver in Southern California has captured the shocking moment a crazed motorcyclist attacked a van while standing at a red light in the town of Victorville.

The road rage incident took place at around 11am Thursday at the intersection of Bear Valley and Mariposa roads.

According to Christian Quezada, who recorded the altercation, he became concerned when he saw a biker open the door of a van standing at a light next to him and yell at the unsuspecting driver.

‘I saw his face,’ Quezada told NBC Los Angeles. ‘He was really scared ... Poor guy.’

At that moment, Quezada pulled out his cell phone and began recording the confrontation between the two strangers.

The footage shows the enraged motorcyclist repeatedly kicking the door of the van on the driver's side and punching the side mirror until it is left dangling by a thread. 

At one point, the attacker appears to return to his bike, but he then quickly walks up to the van again for one last hard kick.

According to Quezada, he also noticed that the biker flashed what appeared to be gang signs at the driver of the van, which made him fearful for his own safety.

The motorcyclist eventually hopped back on his vehicle and took off.

A moment earlier, Quezada said the man pointed to his right leg as if to say that the van had clipped him.

When the light at the intersection turned green, the bike drove away.

The van in the video belongs to a Corona-based company called Century Blinds.

A manager there told CBS Los Angeles the driver has worked for Century Blinds for 16 years, and he had no clue why the biker was so furious at him.

Officials at the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office have reviewed Quezada's road rage recording and would like to interview the mystery biker.

Locating the man may prove challenging, however, since the red motorcycle did not have a rear license plate, and its owner was wearing a wraparound black helmet and gloves.

In the video, the man is seen sporting a black-and-orange jacket with a rucksack trimmed in red on his back.
