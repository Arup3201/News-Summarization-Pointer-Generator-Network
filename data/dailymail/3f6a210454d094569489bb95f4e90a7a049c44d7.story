Harry Kane scored twice as he inspired Tottenham to a famous derby win in front of England manager Roy Hodgson – and even had opposing manager Arsene Wenger urging England to put him in the squad or risk losing him to another country.

Kane scored from close range on 56 minutes and then a climbing header on 85 minutes to take his tally to the season to 22, with Hodgson looking on – though the England manager left early to ensure he could travel across London to watch QPR take on Southampton.

But Wenger, despite being on the end of a 2-1 derby defeat, said that Hodgson will need to move quickly to include Kane in his squad next month for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

Harry Kane's brace against Arsenal in the north London derby brings his tally to 22 goals for the season

The 21-year-old Spurs academy graduate's goalscoring form has put him on the verge of an England call-up

Even Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has conceded that he is impressed by the young forward's form

Kane's rich vein of form comes just after the striker signed a new long-term deal at his boyhood club

Wenger said: 'When you have scored the number of goals he has scored, if you don't put him in there, someone will give him a passport from another country.'

Kane does have a father with Irish ancestors but has said he wants to play for England and it is now inconceivable that he would not be called up to the squad next month if he is fit.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino was delighted with his striker's display – but insist that the 21-year-old can get even better.

'Harry today showed that he is a great player but my idea that he can still improve and we need to push him as his potential is massive. He's in a very good moment e's the leading goal-scorer in all competitions. If the national team manager thinks he's a player for the national team, I'm happy', he said. 

And the Tottenham manager claimed he has had no fear throwing youngsters such as Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason into his team. 

'For me, you watch the training session and afterwards you decide if the player deserves to play. I don't look at the names or their years. This is my philosophy. It's very important for them to believe in our way. When you work with a player, you can see the quality but you still have to give them the possibility to play. You have to take a decision as a manager. You need to take a risk. 

Spurs' derby win was also Arsene Wenger's 700th game in charge of Arsenal

With both sides vying for Champions League spots this season, Spurs' win could prove very significant

Tottenham have now leapfrogged their north London rivals into fifth place in the Premier League table
