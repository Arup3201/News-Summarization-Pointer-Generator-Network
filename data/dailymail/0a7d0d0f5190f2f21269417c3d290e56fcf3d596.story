Alvin the cat: The four-month old Bengal kitten is coming between Nick and his girlfriend Stephanie

There was no room for negotiation. 'I'm getting  a cat,' my girlfriend Stephanie announced one evening in August.

'But I'm allergic to them,' I replied, incredulous. 'They give me asthma, they bring me out in hives , they make my eyes blister.'

'I'm getting a cat,' she repeated.

'Cat owners smell, and women who own them end up sad and lonely,' I argued. 'Besides, we live on a main road. It won't last a month.'

The conversation took place a few weeks after we had moved into our new Surrey home. Alvin arrived two weeks later.

They say in life you are either a cat or a dog person. I'm a neither person. I have children. That's all the responsibility I need.

I went with Stephanie to collect Alvin from a breeder, figuring it would be better to be involved than not to be. I was even trying to negotiate on the journey, suggesting we get a hairless Sphinx variety (they look weird, but they don't make you sneeze). All to no avail.

We were ushered in to choose one of the eight-week-old kittens. In a rash decision that haunts me to this day, I pointed out the liveliest-looking one. 'If you have to get one, get that one; the others look like they've been drugged,' I advised.

So, £125 later, Alvin was packed into his crate to accompany us back around the M25, mewing all the way.

'You've wrenched him from his mother and siblings. He's got separation anxiety. Let's take him back,' I tried between sneezes.

Alvin's forlorn cries soon subsided when we arrived home and he saw the preposterous array of bedding, toys, scratch posts and cat paraphernalia that had been bought for him. He even had a cat Superman outfit in case he fancied a game of dressing-up.

'Welcome to your new home,' purred Stephanie, who fussed over him for an hour before deciding that 'exposure therapy' was the best way for me to overcome the runny eyes and itchy skin that Alvin was sparking in me.

She placed him on my lap on the sofa. 'Have a cuddle with Daddy,' she cooed.

For five minutes we sat awkwardly eyeing each other until Alvin urinated on me, jumped down and trotted away.

That was our introduction three months ago, and since then my relationship with both Alvin and my partner has degenerated.

Teething problems: Alvin wants Stephanie's love - all of it - and Nick is in his way

The cat is coming between us. While Stephanie is increasingly besotted with the new addition to our family, Alvin and I have been having acute teething problems.

It's partly my fault. I didn't read the small print about Bengal cats until a few weeks after he'd settled in and started his erratic behaviour.

Bengals are a cross between domestic cats with Asian leopard cats, hence their attractive markings. Their temperament is often described as being similar to that of Tigger in Winnie The Pooh: energetic, acrobatic and overly exuberant. Ostensibly, we'd homed the feline equivalent of a toddler with adhd who'd been fed all the blue Smarties.

According to the International Bengal Cat Society, these animals 'demand a good deal of attention and affection'.

'Whether they are fishing in the aquarium or playing in their water-bowls, fetching balls for their families, taking walks on a leash or climbing to the top of the highest cupboards, Bengals are constantly on the move and are perfect for anyone who wants to interact and play with their cat daily,' they say.

What concerned me more than the allergy-inducing idea of interacting and playing with my cat daily were the online discussions about Bengals, which mentioned jealousy. Alvin's big green eyes were literal and metaphorical: he wanted Stephanie's love, all of it, and I was in his way.

'They say in life you are either a cat or a
dog person. I'm a neither person. I have children. That's all the 
responsibility I need.'

The skirmishes began with bedtimes. 'He's not coming in the bedroom,' I insisted.

'But he's only small. It's not fair to leave him on his own,'  argued Stephanie.

Initially, I stood my ground and shut him out. After an hour or so mewling and clawing at the door, he'd give up and wait reproachfully outside until the morning.

If he was lucky, someone would need a toilet break in the night. Then, under cover of darkness, he'd throw himself in the room like a four-legged ninja. One night, I woke up screaming after he crawled silently under the covers and clawed at my buttocks.

He'd position himself in the middle of the bed, and if I dared move a limb or digit towards Stephanie, he would attack it before curling up next to her and purring. When I threw him out, I was accused of bullying. The problems got worse as he grew in strength. At just three months old, he was easily able to shove open the bedroom door.

At first, I barricaded it shut with the laundry basket. Then I had to bolster the defences with a suitcase. When he managed to get through that, I bought a rubber door stop, which I now wedge under the door.

Our cosy evenings on the sofa by the fireside have also become a thing of the past. Alvin seems to come alive at night, usually around 8pm when we are settling down for the evening. He careers round the house and leaps at me with claws unsheathed and teeth bared.

Alvin sees me as a human scratching post and, on many occasions, has clambered up my legs and back when I've been on the phone, digging his talons in along the way and forcing me to apologise to the person on the other end of the line for my subsequent expletive-peppered tirade.

Ambushed! Alvin launches another flying attack on Nick. The results aren't pretty

My limbs now resemble those of a self-harmer, so much so that people in the gym look at me with a mixture of shock and pity when I wear shorts and a T-shirt.

One night a few weeks ago I thought Alvin had left the room, so I sidled up to Stephanie for a cuddle. But he had been waiting behind the curtain. In a flash, he climbed up it and then launched himself at me like a feline Exocet missile. I still have the faint scars on my cheek and forehead from the onslaught.

I received no sympathy - far from it. Stephanie thought it was cute that he was so protective.

Grudgingly, I admit his climbing prowess is impressive. I have witnessed him scale an exposed brick chimney breast almost to the ceiling in order to launch at me when I put an arm around my beloved.

He has learned to open drawers, but the only ones he ransacks are mine - Stephanie's remain untouched. A week ago, he opened the key drawer, found my car key and chewed the buttons off the control bit of it.

A romantic Sunday afternoon stroll with Stephanie used to be the highlight of my weekend, but - taking a tip from the Bengal cat website - Stephanie recently bought Alvin a harness and lead. Now he comes with us, trotting between our legs.

'It's good for him to get out and it'll help you two to bond,'  she explained.

To make matters worse, Alvin is too small to be let out on his own. Until he turns six months, he is housebound - and I work from home.

I've discovered to my cost that he likes keyboards. Specifically, my keyboard.

On countless occasions, I have been sitting at my computer working when Alvin will run across the keys. I have lost several pieces of work as he always manages to find the delete button.

I do try. I feed him and stroke him, but usually he attacks my hand.

Skirmishing: Bengals are jealous creatures and Alvin has not taken kindly to Nick

Sometimes, especially when he is asleep, I catch myself thinking what a wonder of evolution and a handsome devil he is.

I also allow myself a smug smile, because I know something he doesn't: at six months old he'll not only be allowed out on his own, he'll also need to be castrated - and I'll be the one who takes him to the vet.

So when Alvin comes round from the anaesthetic and realises something is terribly amiss in his nether regions, I'll be there, smiling, to remind him that I am the Daddy after all, not him.
