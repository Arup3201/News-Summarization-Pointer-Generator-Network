The widow of a retired police officer who shot dead two of their daughters before turning the gun on himself will receive $500,000 in death benefits despite earlier fears she'd be left penniless.

Former White Plains Officer Glen Hochman had filed new retirement papers removing his wife as beneficiary just 10 days before he carried out the killings in Harrison, New York on February 21.

It means that the state could recognize the original form - and it has indicated it will do so, the lawyer, Warren Roth, told the newspaper.

'She would have been left with nothing had this happened two weeks later,' he said. 'They could have decided to accept the other form... but this saves everyone years of litigation.

'We appreciate the state stepping up and helping the family in this critical situation.'

White Plains officials have also indicated that the city will cover health insurance for Mrs DiPietro-Hochman, 50, and her surviving 22-year-old daughter, Samantha, for 90 days, Roth said.

He added that he hopes they can come to a longer-term agreement over the health insurance.  

Glen Hochman, 52, retired from the White Plains force after 22 years on January 30.

Three weeks later, when his wife and their older daughter were in Connecticut, he gunned down 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna with his 40-caliber Glock as they slept.

He then killed their three dogs, typed out a suicide note on the computer and shot himself.

Mrs DiPietro-Hochman asked Alissa's teenage boyfriend to check the house because neither had been able to contact anyone there. He discovered Hochman's body in the garage.

He called police who found the girls' bodies. 

Hochman, who had no known health or psychiatric problems, apparently carried out the killings after he and his wife had spoken about a possible separation weeks earlier. 

Before the murders, Mrs DiPietro-Hochman went to police to report a non-violent argument with her husband over an $80 cellphone bill because a friend had urged her to record such incidents.

Authorities said the suicide note, which was addressed to his wife and which included five or six pages of instructions on getting things in order, indicated that the killings were premeditated.

Interviews with people who knew him found no one had an inkling that 'Mr. Hoffman would have committed this heinous crime,' said Harrison police Chief Anthony Marraccini last week.

Still, 'Harrison police investigators discovered a suicide note at the residence indicating that the killings were premeditated by Mr. Hochman,' he said. 

He added: 'It's difficult, especially when you see two young girls, their lives have been ripped away, brutally murdered. You can't get any rationale for that... The act is so incredibly bad.'
