It's not often you hear of fears of a zombie invasion - and if you do, it's almost certainly on television.

But
 in the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead, the Pentagon has a plan in order to 'preserve the sanctity of human life' among all the 'non-zombie humans.'

The country's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in from an unclassified document, obtained by Foreign Policy magazine, called 'CONOP 8888' - otherwise known as 'Counter-Zombie Dominance'.

In the event of an apocalypse brought about by an army of the undead, the Pentagon has a plan in order to 'preserve the sanctity of human life' among all the 'non-zombie humans'

The document is dated April 30, 2011 and is a detailed synopsis for battling many kinds of zombies.

According to the plan the
 'worst case threat scenario,' is a zombie attack in which zombies eating lots of humans therefore infecting them quickly, leaving little time for a response.

The document also addresses 'CZs' otherwise known as chicken zombies.

'Although it sounds ridiculous, this is 
actually the only proven class of zombie that actually exists,' the plan
 states.

'So-called 'CZs' occur when old hens that can no longer lay eggs
 are euthanized by farmers with carbon monoxide, buried, and then claw 
their way back to the surface,' CONOP 8888 notes.  

Other possible attacks include evil magic zombies created through occult experimentation and vegetarian zombies which survive on plants so pose no threat to human life and zombies from space. 

The report contains a disclaimer that 'this plan was not actually designed as a joke', but it originated  after military planners in Omaha, Nebraska, wanted a scenario for dealing with a widespread national emergency.

They created a zombie attack plan that covered training civilians how to survive in a post-apocalyptic world - deployment of military was also a large factor in the plans.

'The document is identified as a training tool used in an in-house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario,' Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze wrote to the magazine in an email.

'This document is not a U.S. Strategic Command plan.'

It is not unusual for the Army to be 
called upon to save the day in zombie films. In 2004 comedy Shaun of the
 Dead, soldiers arrive just in time to save the film's hero.

In 2012, troops in the US were trained using a mock zombie invasion.

Hundreds
 of military, law enforcement and medical personnel observed the 
Hollywood-style production of a zombie attack as part of their emergency
 response training.

In the scenario, dubbed 'Zombie Apocalypse', a VIP was trapped in a village, surrounded by zombies when a bomb exploded.

The VIP was wounded and his team had to move through the town while dodging bullets and shooting at the invading zombies.

At one point, some of the team are hit 
by zombies and have to be taken to a field medical facility for 
decontamination and treatment.

The Pentgaon is not the only country with a plan - so does Britain,

In 2012 Britain's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in a response to an enquiry from a member of the public.

A Freedom of Information request has shown the surprising level of readiness for the eventuality.

The Ministry of Defence would not lead efforts to plan for such a horror attack or deal with the aftermath, reported by the Daily Telegraph, because that role would rest with the Cabinet Office, which co-ordinates emergency planning for the Government.

The
 MoD replied to the FoI request: 'In the event of an apocalyptic 
incident (e.g. zombies), any plans to rebuild and return England to its 
pre-attack glory would be led by the Cabinet Office, and thus any 
pre-planning activity would also take place there.

'The
 Ministry of Defence's role in any such event would be to provide 
military support to the civil authorities, not take the lead.

'Consequently the Ministry of Defence holds no information on this matter.'
