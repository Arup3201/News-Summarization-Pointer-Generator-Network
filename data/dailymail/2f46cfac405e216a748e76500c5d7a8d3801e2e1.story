Senior Labor MP Anthony Byrne has warned that Australia faces the prospect of a terrorist attack similar in scale to the Bali bombings, and has pleaded with the government to be more proactive in the face of such a threat.

He also raised concerns that Australia's security forces will be restricted in preventing an attack unless Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and other spy agencies are granted new powers.

Despite requests for such powers, these have been refused to date, reported The Daily Telegraph.

A Bali bombing-type terrorist attack will certainly happen in Australia according to Labor MP Anthony Byrne

The Labor MP and former Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security chair revealed the sentiments of the intelligence community in parliament on Monday.

'That event will be there to cause immense damage to the psyche of the Australian community. That will be its purpose, its intent,' he said.

'I donâ€™t want to be part of a parliament that reacts to an event. I want to be part of a parliament that puts laws in place to prevent that event.'

The 2002 Bali bombing happened in the tourist district of Kuta on October 12 and killed 202 people, including 88 Australians and left hundreds injured.

Labor MP Anthony Byrne revealed in parliament that an attack of similar magnitude to the Bali bombing was 'inevitable'

Members of Islamist group Jemaah Islamiyah were convicted in relation to the bombings.

Senior officials from Australia's security services meet tomorrow for a private briefing with Attorney-General George Brandis before legislation to give ASIO new powers is introduced to parliament.

On the back of a bipartisan report completed last year of the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security calls for additional powers for ASIO, it has been reported that Mr Brandis would adopt 41 of 43 recommendations.

Yet the government has not included the controversial date retention laws, which would force internet and telecommunication companies to keep metadata for a period of two years.

Similar laws were granted to UK spy agencies last week and Mr Byrne said without data retention powers, Australian spy agencies were limited in what he considers a current a high-risk period.

Despite warnings about domestic terrorist activity and links to Australians fighting with jihadists in Syria and Iraq, spy chiefs are worried the federal government is not acting quick enough.

One of Australia's most high-profile jihadists, Khaled Sharrouf, fled Australia in December on his brother's passport to link up with fundamentalist militia group Islamic State in Syria.

Sharrouf is currently being investigated by Australian authorities in relation to allegations he is fighting with Islamic State - a breakaway al-Qaeda group.

One of Australia's most well-known jihadists, Khaled Sharrouf, fled Australia in December on his brother's passport to link up with fundamentalist militia group Islamic State in Syria

In 2008, he became a convicted terrorist when he pleaded guilty and was jailed for acts in preparation for a terrorist act after he was one of eight people arrested for plotting to attack the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, in Sydney's south.

Sharrouf recently issued a call-to-arms for other Australian Muslims to join Islamic State's bloody war in the Middle East as well as posting a photo on Twitter of a young child brandishing a rifle.

In the early hours of July 5, Sharrouf tweeted: 'Come and be part of what we have dreamt...for decades'. It was accompanied by a picture of him decked out in army camouflage posing with a gun in front of a white BMW.

This followed his fellow brother-in-arms Mohamed Elomar, one of almost 60 Australians fighting for extremist groups in the Middle East, who took aim at diggers fighting in Iraq, tweeting: 'Look at the end of these Iraqi maliki dogs bunch of girls can't wait to see a Australia soldier cyring [sic] saying bakia.'

Another tweet fired off from Sharrouf read: 'My (provisions) are beneath the shade of my sword. We live better than we lived in our country.'

But these uploads barely scratch the surface of the disturbing content found on Sharrouf's Twitter page.

Earlier posts contain pictures so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to describe or publish them.

But one that can be shared is of a young child brandishing a gun and smiling with the caption: 'One of dawlas [sic] youngest members' - which was posted late May. Dawlah is Arabic for country or state.

Other photos show Sharrouf standing in front of military vehicles as well as fundamentalist propaganda memes.

He told people to 'come and be part of what we have dreamt For for decades' and said: 'we live better than we lived in our country '

These tweets came just days after the Australian Government said almost 60 Australians fight for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria.

Meanwhile about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight.

This information was revealed after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, became the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family in June bound for Iraq to fight in the troubled war zone.

He went missing from his family's Bankstown home - in Western Sydney - almost three weeks ago, and has only been heard from once when he contacted his mother to say he was in Turkey.

Ten Australians have died while fighting for extremists in Syria and Iraq.

The latest is a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group Islamic State - formerly known as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' and 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria' - shortly before he was ambushed in Syria.

In one of the recruitment videos entitled There Is No Life Without Jihad, an Australian man who calls himself Abu Yahya ash Shami said he wanted to send 'a message...from a Muslim brother's heart to another brother's heart'.

He appeals to Australian Muslims to come join him in the Middle East to restore 'honour' in the region, saying: 'Wake up, wake up and be part of this effort.'
