David Edgerton, 23, has been jailed for nine years for the rape of a 14-year-old in North Wales last August

A judge has slammed police and prosecutors after a serial sex offender raped a 14-year-old girl just ten days after being freed on bail for another rape.

David Edgerton, 23, of Connah's Quay, Flintshire, was jailed for nine years today after admitting dragging the schoolgirl into woods and attacking her last August.

But judge Merfyn Hughes said the victim and her family are entitled to 'an explanation' after it emerged Edgerton was free on bail at the time, despite being arrested for the rape of a 42-year-old woman ten days earlier.

Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales also heard that Edgerton had a history of violent and sexual offences against females stretching back to 2009 including an attack on a 10-year-old girl.

Judge Hughes said: 'In my judgement both the victims and their families are entitled to as 
full an explanation of the matters which led to the defendant being at 
liberty and able to commit some of the offences.

'I would suggest the 
Crown Prosecution Service and police should offer to provide the 
explanation in person if they so request it.'

The court heard how in August last year Edgerton had initially attempted to abduct a 13-year-old girl in the village of Leeswood near Mold in Wales but he stopped when a friend arrived.

A short time later he conned the 14-year-old victim into showing him the way to find a pub before dragging her into woods, threatening to kill her then raping her.

During the horrific ordeal the terrified girl managed to send a message to her sister's Facebook page via her mobile phone saying 'help' and 'raping me'. 

Her family frantically set out to find her and the victim could hear them calling her name as she was being attacked.

The victim's mother eventually found the girl after she escaped and got back to the road.

'It's impossible to avoid 
the conclusion the psychological scars of what you did to her will 
remain with her for the rest of her life,' he told Edgerton.

At an earlier hearing, Edgerton was convicted by a jury of attempting to rape a 20-year-old woman in her bedroom at Connah's Quay, Flintshire, in June 2009.

At the time the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge him because the evidence available was insufficient to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.

In December 2011, Edgerton was jailed for six months after grabbing a ten-year-old girl in Chester.

The victim had told Cheshire police at the time she knew Edgerton wanted to take her somewhere and 'do stuff'.

But despite her evidence he was only charged with common assault.

As part of the current proceedings, he was convicted of assault with intent to commit a sexual offence.

Edgerton was also found guilty of raping a 42-year-old woman in Warrington in August last year.

Judge Hughes remarked: 'The third time he commits a serious sexual offence and the police and CPS don't bring all the threads together and realise how dangerous he is.'

The judge said the bail decision puzzled him. 'There's no explanation why the police and CPS couldn't have understood the danger this man presented. In the absence of a full explanation, which I have no doubt will be subject of a full inquiry, I find it difficult to express a view because I don't have all the information.'

Last night Detective Chief Inspector Peter Shaw of Cheshire police said : 'A full review of the rationale and decision making surrounding the decision to grant Edgerton police bail has been conducted by the Cheshire Constabulary Professional Standards Department.

'In any criminal case, the decision to charge with an offence, and to give consideration to removing an individual's entitlement to bail is based upon the evidence pertaining to the offence for which the suspect has been arrested.

'The decision to charge for serious offences must be reviewed by the Crown Prosecution Service and only when the evidence is deemed strong enough will authorisation to charge be granted. Until this point, the suspect's entitlement to bail would remain and there is no ability to introduce further bad character evidence at this stage.

Judge Merfyn Hughes QC: 'There's no explanation why the police and CPS couldn't have understood the danger this man presented.'

'The circumstances of Edgerton's arrest in Cheshire, in 2012, was the suspicion of the rape of a 42-year-old woman. These circumstances were quite different to that of the other offences of which he was suspected.

'Ensuring that offences of rape are dealt with in an effective, yet compassionate, manner is a priority for Cheshire Police. Rape and sexual assaults are amongst the most traumatic of crimes. We want victims to be assured that we are here to help.

'Anyone who has been subjected to this type of crime should feel confident that they will receive the support they need from the Dedicated Rape Unit and other support agencies we work alongside. Foremost, any victim of a crime such as this will be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, and any allegations will be thoroughly investigated and with the needs of the victim as our main priority.'

The CPS also defended its actions. Ed Beltrami, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Wales said: 'David Edgerton is a highly dangerous individual who is guilty of a string of horrific and violent offences. It is right that he has received a significant custodial sentence.'

He added: 'Over the last few weeks I have reviewed the CPS involvement in this case so that I can be assured that we have acted in accordance with our obligations under the Code for Crown Prosecutors at all times.

'The CPS was first asked to provide advice to police on an allegation of attempted rape against

may have had weak evidence to support a realistic prospect of 
conviction, became stronger cases when looked at together.'

David Edgerton in 2009. At that time, a decision not to charge was taken on the grounds that the evidence available was insufficient to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. This was mainly because the victim was unable to identify the suspect with sufficient clarity. At that stage, this was the only allegation relating to Edgerton.

'In December 2011 Edgerton was successfully convicted of common assault on a child in Warrington.

'In August 2012 Edgerton raped a woman in Broughton, Cheshire. Police were still investigating this incident when Edgerton committed his terrible crimes in Leeswood less than two weeks later. The Broughton incident was not referred to the CPS by police until after Leeswood attacks had occurred.

'Once Cheshire police referred a file on the Broughton rape to the CPS, it was considered alongside the files on the Leeswood incidents. All matters were immediately dealt with holistically.

'Some of the offences that individually may have had weak evidence to support a realistic prospect of conviction, became stronger cases when looked at together. As a result, Edgerton was charged with all offences, including the attempted rape in 2009. A further charge of assault with intent to commit a sexual offence was added, in relation to the Warrington common assault.

'I am satisfied that the CPS considered all allegations against Edgerton in the correct manner, as soon as the evidential files relating to these horrific offences were passed to us. By doing so, the prosecuting authorities ensured that successful prosecution of all the offences was possible.'
