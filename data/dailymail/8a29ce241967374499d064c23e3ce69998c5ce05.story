Mentally-ill sex offender Ferdinand Manila (pictured in an e-fit) attacked two woman last year and has now been given an indefinite hospital order

A sex attacker has been locked up after one of his victims bit off his tongue, which was later used to provide vital DNA evidence.

Ferdinand Manila, 28, pounced on the woman as she walked along an alleyway in Dunstable, Bedfordshire in January last year. 

But she sank her teeth into his tongue and Manila fled with blood running from his mouth.

The victim, 28, spat out the piece of flesh but kept it to give to police.

Mentally-ill Manila went on to assault a second woman later the same day, grabbing a 55-year-old from behind and stroking her.

He was caught two months later when he was arrested on suspicion of three separate offences, of which he was later cleared by a jury.

Luton Crown Court heard police kept the piece of tongue and matched his DNA to the earlier attacks.

Judge Barbara Mensah said: 'He approached the first victim in an alleyway and forced his tongue into her mouth.

'She bravely bit some of it off and removed it from her mouth later on and took it to police.

'It has caused serious psychological harm. His first victim took a big risk when she bit off a part of Mr Manila's tongue.

'This was very distressing for her. The public needs to be protected from the nature of these offences that can cause serious psychological harm.'

Manila, of Dunstable, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against the two women and was given an indefinite hospital order.

The court heard Manila was being detained in psychiatric hospital Oak Tree Manor in Essex where he continued to act inappropriately.

Part of Manila's tongue was bitten off during an attack in this alleyway in Dunstable in January last year

Psychiatric professionals at the hospital reported that he has said that he wanted to peel the skin off people.

They also said he makes sexual comments to female staff and derogatory comments to male staff.

The woman who bit off Manila's tongue said she was determined to get as much evidence about him as possible.

She said: 'I fought him off as much as I could and wanted to leave as much evidence as possible on his body and my body to show that it was not consensual in any way, shape or form.

'I wanted to gather as much evidence as I could - under my nails, by biting his tongue - so that police could catch him.

'Initially, he went in for a kiss, but then as soon as I started fighting back and biting and scratching him that's when he tried to make the sexual advances. It freaked me out.'

The woman lost her place at university as she took time off deal with the trauma of the attack, but now hopes to start again.

Luton Crown Court heard Manila has talked about 'peeling off people's skin' since he was hospitalised

The victim added: 'The incident, from when it happened to when he was caught, was very tough.

'I was afraid to leave the house, constantly looking over my shoulder, I couldn't get any college work done and ultimately lost my place at university.

'But, I can't live my life in constant fear, otherwise I'd be letting people like him win.'

Extraordinarily, she says she has now forgiven Manila for his crime.

She added: 'I know he's really sick and I'm glad that he's in the hospital, it's the best place for him. Hopefully it means that he can get better in the future and start his life over like I'm hoping to now.'
