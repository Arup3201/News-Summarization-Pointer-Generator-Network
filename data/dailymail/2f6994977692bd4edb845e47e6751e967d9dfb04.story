David Sisi will rejoin former club London Irish on a season-long loan from Bath this summer.

The 22-year-old London Irish academy graduate will return to the Madejski Stadium club for the entire campaign, in a bid for regular first-team rugby.

Sisi joined Bath in the summer of 2013 when the Recreation Ground club completed an extensive raid on some of Irish's prized assets.

The Germany-born back-rower followed Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and Matt Garvey in making the switch from Irish to Bath.

Former London Irish coaches Toby Booth and Neal Hatley were able to entice that clutch of talent out along the M4 to Bath, and now Sisi is travelling the other way - in the short term, at least.

'I'm excited to be returning to London Irish on loan next season,' said Sisi.

'It will be great to go back to a club that has done so much for me in the past and I'm looking forward to making the most of the opportunity over the season.

'All young players need consistent game time to help them improve and learn, and the back row is such a competitive position at Bath that this is a really good opportunity for me to get that time on the pitch.'

Full-back Tom Homer is the latest Irish player to make the Bath switch, joining head coach Mike Ford's squad earlier this term.

Former Irish prop Max Lahiff has also joined Bath this season, further swelling the Reading ex-pats in the west country.

Sisi will return to Bath for the 2016-17 season, by which time the coaching staff hope he will be ready to challenge the likes of Francois Louw and Leroy Houston for starts in the back-row.

'Dave is a very talented young player, so we're looking forward to seeing how he progresses with London Irish before coming back to us,' said Bath boss Mike Ford.

'We want our young players to become the best players they can be, and this loan move gives Dave that chance.'

Junior World Championship winner Sisi blazed a trail through London Irish's much-vaunted academy system, and operations director Bob Casey is delighted to welcome back the young talent.

The Exiles are rebuilding under new ownership and more stable investment, with new coach Tom Coventry arriving to take the helm for next season.

'David joined London Irish at 16 and came through our AASE and academy programmes,' said Casey.

'We are delighted he will be returning to the club next season.

'He is young, English and can play across the entire back row and is ambitious and excited about the challenge of returning to London Irish.'
