Scott A. Carmitchel, who has been arrested on suspicion of stealing $43,500 from the Bellagio casino and using the money on prostitutes. He refused to co-operate with police who had to hold his head in position for his mug shot

A suspect arrested in connection with stealing $43,000 at gunpoint from the Bellagio Casino allegedly celebrated the heist by blowing money on prostitutes on the Las Vegas Strip.

Detectives say Scott A. Carmitchel, 34 from Kansas robbed a casino cashier of $43,500 at gunpoint on Friday night and later paid prostitutes at another hotel with the money still bound in Bellagio wrappers.

He was arrested on Saturday night and is currently being held on $84,000 bail and is due to appear in court today to face charges of battery, grand larceny, burglary and robbery with a deadly weapon.

The robbery occurred at 8.30pm on Friday when a man walked up to a Bellagio cashier's cage, pulled a gun from a backpack and demanded money from a clerk, who later told police she feared she would die if she didn't co-operate.

The arrest of Carmitchel came after investigators were tipped off by a tourist from Texas who said he became suspicious after a man paid him $300 to rent him a $405 room at the Hard Rock Hotel.

Police later detained four prostitutes who left the room, two carrying wads of cash with Bellagio labels. They told police the man was acting erratic, paranoid and delusional, according to a police report.

Investigators said the suspect acknowledged his picture was on Bellagio surveillance tape, but he denied that he committed the robbery. He told them he went to the casino but didn't remember what happened, an arrest report states.

Police eventually searched the room and found $10,000 in cash along with a BB gun that matched the description of the weapon used during the robbery.

They also said they found a shirt they believe was worn by the robber, a $1,800 pair of black Louis Vuitton shoes, and an $800 Louis Vuitton belt, along with recent shopping receipts.

About half the money taken remained unaccounted for, the police report added.

In his mug shot, police had to forcibly hold his head in position as he refused to co-operate in any way and was combative with officers throughout the booking process.

Kansas Department of Corrections records show a Scott Alan Carmitchel served time for battery against a law officer and a robbery in 1998, and he was sent to prison most recently a year ago for making a criminal threat.

Cartmitchel is accused of checking into a room at the Hard Rock Hotel, where police found four prostitutes, two of whom were carrying wads of cash with Bellagio labels

He was paroled in December and the department listed him as 'absconded' with his whereabouts unknown as of May 29.

Las Vegas police spelled his last name 'Carmitchell' on a booking photo released on late Tuesday.

Kansas authorities have spelled it both ways but list his true name with just one 'L,' and list the other spelling as an alias.
