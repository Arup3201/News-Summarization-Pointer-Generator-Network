Britain is a nation of soap lovers, but it’s not just us humans that like to watch some on-screen drama.

Apparently dogs – well a particular Shetland Sheepdog – just cannot get enough of popular soap opera EastEnders.

Videoed lying on the sitting room floor, the dog named Alfie initially appears to be content minding its own business.

Suddenly, Graham Broad’s iconic drum roll that features at the start of the famous EastEnders theme tune is audible from the television, and the dog turns towards it in anticipation.

As the melody picks up, the dog, which is now staring intently at the screen, lifts its head back and lets out a little howl.

At first it appears to be like any other dog singing along to a particular tune of their choosing.

But it’s only as the song continues that the dog’s musical prowess is shown off in all its glory.

Howling in a relatively controlled manner, Alfie actually appears to mimic the exact notes present in the song.

And better still the dog doesn't just howl over the top of the melody, but instead stops in time for the breaks within the composition.

The video was captured by the dog's owners at home in Whitehall, London.

Composed in 1984, the EastEnders theme tune is the work of Simon May and Leslie Osborne.

The theme tune  was cited as the most recognisable piece of music in the UK in a 2008 poll conducted by PRS for Music, seeing off competition from the English national anthem.
