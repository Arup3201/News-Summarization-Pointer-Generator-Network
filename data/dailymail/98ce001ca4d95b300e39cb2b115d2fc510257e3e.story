While brightly coloured kit is allowed at many other tennis tournaments, Wimbledon is famous for enforcing its rule of only allowing players to wear white.

But stylish female competitors have been bending the rules by adding a splash of colour to their outfits via their nail varnish.

Serena Williams led the charge taking to centre court today sporting elaborately painted nails.

Not entirely white: Serena Williams wore orange shorts under her skirt and intricately painted nails

Super hero: The defending champion had nails in animal print and one with the word 'pow!'

The U.S. defending champion modelled a different style on each tip including animal print, diamante encrusted and comic strip 'pow!' in shades of orange.

She also stretched the clothing guidelines by wearing orange shorts under her white skirt (the rules state a 'preference' for shorts to be totally white and a 'preference towards pastel colours').   

Meanwhile her socks had a small orange bobble at the heel. The style savvy player also showed off her fashion process by wearing a smart white blazer as she warmed up on court this morning before taking victory against Mandy Minella.

The British female players followed in Serena's style footsteps by also painting their nails in bright colours.

Going for gold: But Heather Watson's glittery nails didn't reflect a glittering performance

Heather Watson displayed a glittery gold polish as she played on court two.

She wrote on a blog for beauty company, Benefit, who are one of her sponsors: 'As a treat, I recently got my nails done too which was a lovely luxury. I
had complete trust in nail extraordinaire Micheal Doe, so let him 
create what he wanted. He is so creative!

'All of this help me to relax and calm me down in the build-up to Wimbledon.'

Unfortunately her choice of gold colour didn't reflect a winning performance as she lost to American Madison Keys - who sported dark blue nails.

Dashes of colour: Maria Kirilenko, left, had neon green nails while victorious Laura Robson went for bright pink

Meanwhile, when Laura Robson played this afternoon she also followed the trend with shocking pink nails and a matching pink hair band.

Her Russian opponent Maria Kirilenko broke a rule of having 'no  fluorescent colours' by painting her nails neon green.

The 'predomiately in white' rule was introduced in 1963 and the 'almost entirely in white' was established in 1995, according to the Wimbledon website.

The championship has set out a list of what is acceptable on-court attire stating there should be 'no solid mass of colouring', 'no dark or bold colours' and accessories like hats and socks to be 'almost entirely white.'

Players must wear 'recognised tennis attire' according to both Grand Slam and WTA rules and 'a decision on the day as to whether clothing/players' turnout is suitable at discretion of Referee.'
