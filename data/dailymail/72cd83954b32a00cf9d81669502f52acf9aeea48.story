Wilfried Zaha's tour of America with Manchester United reached a new low on Saturday when he was put through a double warm down session after the club's victory over Roma.

Zaha is the only member of United's 26-man touring party not to play a single minute of the club's two games so far.

And - along with three other unused subs on Saturday - the young winger was told to do an aerobic session and then a gym session at Denver's Sports Authority Field.

Peripheral: Zaha is the only player on the 26-man squad United took to America who is yet to feature

Zaha, Darren Fletcher and goalkeepers David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard returned to the United dressing room drenched in sweat after a series of interval sprints in the heat on the pitch after Saturday's 3-2 win.

However, as they prepared to shower they were told by manager Louis van Gaal to head to the gym where one of the club's fitness coaches was waiting for them.

Van Gaal is determined to bring his squad's fitness up to speed in time for the new season.

They have been doing double sessions every day out here and that will continue as they head to Washington today and then to Detroit.

Opportunity: Louis van Gaal has said Zaha has 'worked well' and be used as a striker in one of their games

Van Gaal said: 'They are not fit yet. Not really. None of them.'

The United manager also said that Zaha has 'worked well' so far on tour and will be used as a striker in one of the games.
