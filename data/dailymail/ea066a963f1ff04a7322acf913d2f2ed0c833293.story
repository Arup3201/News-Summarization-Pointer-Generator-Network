An impromptu midnight fishing trip in Florida has turned up an extraordinary catch.

And the fishermen captured the moment on video.

Dustin Richter said it took him and his pals over two hours to wrangle a rare 11-foot long, 500-pound sawfish into shore at Boynton Beach Inlet on Sunday morning.

'Catching a fish like that is like once in a lifetime,' Richter told ABC.

What a catch: Dustin Richter (front left) and his friends caught an enormous sawfish in Boynton Beach, Florida, on Sunday morning

Spending over two hours trying to reel the animal to shore, the boys managed to get some of it on camera

Dustin Richter said they knew they had to let the sawfish go once they got it close enough to shore

Although the group let the sawfish go, they kept one thing - a tooth that came off its snout during the reeling

But it almost didn't happen. Richet and his friends had planned to have a poker night, before making a last-minute decision for a late-night fishing session.

'About an hour after putting our lines out we were about to leave,' Richter said.

'But something started clicking, the reel started going off, and it felt about four or five feet.

'It got to the light and we saw the fish and saw it was a sawfish - we were amazed.

'It was 11 feet long and the bill was about 4 feet long.'

Richter said it is extremely rare to see a sawfish, let alone catch one.

'It's just one of those prehistoric-looking animals,' he said.

'If you see them you're lucky to see them and if you catch them you're even luckier.'

Despite their sinister aesthetic, sawfish aren't a direct threat to humans.

They use their 'saw'‚Äù to capture and kill prey - mostly smaller fish, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Sawfish are an endangered species and are usually found in shallow, coastal waters.
