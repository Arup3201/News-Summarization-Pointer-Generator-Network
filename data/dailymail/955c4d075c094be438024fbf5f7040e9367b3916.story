Two friends have battled dehydration, blistering heat and freezing wind to run across America in just 79 days.

Friends Stephen Pope, 47, and Chris Finill, 54, crossed 3,100 miles on foot, averaging 40 miles a day, in their epic journey across the continental United States.

Their route took them from the 
Pacific to the Atlantic - from California, through the heat of Nevada, 
to Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.

Between them, the pair consumed 12,000 calories and drank 26 pints of fluid a day and exhausted seven pairs of running shoes.

Running every day for 79 days, friends Stephen (right) Pope, 47, of Sheffield, and Chris Finill, 54, (left) of Guildford crossed 3,100 miles, braving blistering heat and freezing wind to complete a road run across the continental United States. The friends are pictured in Nevada

Mr Pope, a student accommodation 
landlord from Sheffield, said: 'Each day would start the same way - with
me thinking I could barely get out of bed because of the aches and 
pains, let alone run 40 miles.

'Each morning, I wondered whether I'd get through the pain barrier, but I always did. The next day, it would start all over again.'

Their run, which began in San Francisco and ended in New York, raised £15,000 for forces charity Help for Heroes.

Mr Pope said: 'We did a couple of practice runs between my home in Sheffield and Chris's home in Guildford - a distance of about 250 miles. 

'But beyond that, we were rather unprepared. We didn't leave much time to acclimatise. We got off the plane in San Francisco at 3pm and by 5pm we were running. Soon we were running at an altitude of 600ft, which was very taxing. 

'My favourite part was the Nevada desert. At the start of the day it was totally still, and the scenery was like a canvas. You could see 20 miles in each direction. 

'The mountain scenery through the Rockies was breathtaking and we were lucky to see the seasons change into Autumn.

The friends reach Iowa. But before they set off for the States they only had a few practice runs between their homes in Sheffield and Guildford - a distance of about 250 miles

Stephen makes friends with a local dog in Iowa. They were supported in their adventure by Mr Pope's wife Penny and Mr Finill's wife Julia, who drove the support car

'Being outside for so long, you really felt closer to nature.'

The pair decided to make the trip after reading James E. Shapiro's book Meditations from the Breakdown Lane: Running Across America, a book well-regarded among runners for its descriptions of the author's own long-distance trek.

Mr Pope said: 'Three weeks in, Chris's ankle swelled up alarmingly. I thought: "this is it, we can't go on. He's a goner".

'But eventually his body healed. He was determined to power through and his body responded.

'At one point in Colorado I was running along when a rattlesnake reared up, hissing and jumpy, in front of me. I jumped straight into the road out of fright. We later thought it would have been ironic if I'd been hit by a truck after jumping out of the way of the snake.'

A pile of running shoes and trainers the pair wore out over the course of their trip. Between them, they exhausted seven pairs of shoes

Mr Finill, an accountant, was welcomed to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, by his son Tom. 

Also present at the finish line was James E. Shapiro, who had heard about their trip and was keen to meet them. Mr Pope said: 'It was a strange feeling coming the end of the line. We both wondered what we were going to do next.'Not content to rest, they took part in the New York Marathon the very next day. 

'We'd timed the trip to get back to New York in time for the marathon,' said Mr Pope. 'After running 40 miles a day, it seemed like nothing at all. 

'I heard someone near to me on the start line say he regretted running ten miles the previous week because he was still stiff. I thought: "we ran 287 miles last week".'

Since completing the cross-continent run in November 2011, Mr Pope has been planning a return to North America, where he hopes to complete the 2,500 miles of the Great Divide mountain bike trail.

He said: 'It doesn't look as if Chris will be able to take the time off, unfortunately. So I just need to find someone mad enough to come with me.'
