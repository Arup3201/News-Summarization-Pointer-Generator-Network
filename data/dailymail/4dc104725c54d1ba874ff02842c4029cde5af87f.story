A Joey Essex wannabe dubbed Britain's vainest man has been forced to flee his home after receiving death threats over his £55,000 bid to look like the TOWIE star.

Sam Barton, 22, transformed his face with several cosmetic operations - including a nose job funded by the taxpayer - in a desperate attempt to look like Joey Essex.

Last week he announced he planned to sue the NHS over the 'botched' operation so he could spend the money on a BMW.

His comments sparked a backlash on Twitter and Facebook, where he has received death threats from vile trolls.

Sick: A tweet sent to Mr Barton suggested he hang himself after he asked what he should do one evening

On Sunday night, Mr Barton asked his 22,000 Twitter followers for ideas on what he should do that evening.

One user, using the name Mr Nobody, replied: 'hang yourself'.

Mr Barton retweeted the post, leading followers to criticise the person who sent the message.

Chris Brackley wrote: 'That is way to [sic] strong is there any need for that at all.'

Mr Barton also tweeted that a man had threatened to break the Joey Essex wannabe's nose.

Other sick trolls posted death threats to the 22-year-old on Facebook, forcing him to flee his parents' home in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, to a friend's house for his family's safety.

Barton, a barman who lives with his parents and brother, said: 'I am leaving my family home as I don't want to put my family at risk.

'I am prepared to receive a lot of abuse as what I say is controversial, but I think a line is drawn when someone says they will kill you.

'I am looking to move into a flat. My parents don't really want me to leave but they understand my decision. I just don't want to put them at risk.

'It really has unnerved me. You don't know what some people are capable of.

'I have reported it to the police and they have told me they will investigate. I am meeting them again and will take it from there.'

In August, Mr Barton was left with a bruised lip after he was punched in the face in a nightclub in Romford, Essex. 

During the altercation, the suspect allegedly shouted: 'You will need a new nose job before I have finished with you' in reference to Mr Barton's £5,000 taxpayer-funded nose job.

The wannabe celebrity claims to be good friends with White Dee from Benefits Street, set on James Turner Street in Birmingham

Mr Barton said he was driven to sue the NHS for the 'botched' nose job because it has left his nose 'uneven'

He has also spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment.

He payed £5,400 for another nose straightening operation which was not done by the NHS.

Mr Barton said he had been driven to sue the health service because of negative comments people have made since he hit the headlines after his 'uneven' nose job.

Despite the backlash, Mr Barton - who claims to be best friends with Benefits Street's White Dee - still intends to continue his quest to become the 'perfect man'.

He added: 'I don't really feel good about myself. I still want loads of surgery done.' 

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Mr Barton has been in to the police station to report online death threats.

'We have arranged for him to come and see an officer so he can give us the full facts and we can take it from there.'
