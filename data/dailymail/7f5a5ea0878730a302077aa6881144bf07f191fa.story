The worst thing about Batman: Arkham Origins isn't the predicable gameplay, lack of invention and a general failure to evolve the series. These elements, although frustrating, still don't make it a bad game.

No. The major annoyance here comes in the way the game was released to reviewers. Given the worldwide embargo on Friday (which coincided with the game's release), many publishers were given just hours to play and review it before racing to get their opinions up before anyone else.

Danger from above: combat still remains fun, but by the end of the game you're left wanting something new

How any of those publications who received the game on Friday and managed to write a review on the same day is baffling... Especially given how much there is to do...

Still, skepticism aside, put a decent amount of time into Arkham Origins and you'll be handsomely rewarded. There are plenty of Enigma quests, side missions, optional crime in progress quests and that's not even scratching the game's surface.

Plot follows a 30-something-year-old Batman who's on the hunt for Black Mask - a ruthless anti-hero who's put a price on the Dark Knight's head.

He's even enlisted the help of several unsavoury characters, such as Deathstroke and Deadshot, who are all fighting over who takes home the $50million bounty.

So, Smokin' Aces in Gotham City it is, then. Not the how-Bruce-Wayne-became-Batman story many fans were hoping for...

Gameplay is more of the same - namely, focusing on knocking out baddies using a free-flow counter-centered combat system. It's still rewarding taking out 10 thugs unscathed and amassing a large combo, but there's no ignoring the fact that it's starting to become stale.

To mix things up, new enemy types, in particular, the martial artist - throw in new defensive abilities, but these are soon quickly telegraphed.

Surpisingly, although the staple batarangs, cryptographic scanner and explosive gel (complete with trademark awful-looking explosion) pull their weight, the newer gadgets are so unbalanced that they're not as fun to use.

Shock and awe: the Shock Gauntlets are incredibly unbalanced and can wipe out most foes with ease

Shock Gauntlets, for example, that are unlocked later in the game, allow you to wipe out hordes of goons with ease.

What has been improved, though - at least on a superficial level - are the crime scene investigations. Here, you can use your evidence scanner to rebuild the scene of a crime - rewinding and fast-forwarding to look for clues. It's stunning to behold - even though it's essentially a simple 'find the clues' premise.

Visually, the game looks superb on the most part, with one noticeable caveat... Gotham City is completely lifeless.

There's no sense that you're flying around a living, breathing city - rather a map with monster closets and goon patrols scattered around. We've seen with the likes of GTA V that such a premise isn't beyond current gen's power, so there really is no excuse.

Cut-scenes are noticeable prettier, though, opting for a more CGI-stylised look than the previous game's slightly tarted-up Unreal Engine 3's offerings.

Animation remains strong throughout - especially notable during the game's (mostly) entertaining boss battles. A run-in with Deathstroke is particularly memorable - mixing quick-fire combos and gadgets with frenetic countering sequences.

The best bits: although many missions see you fly to a place and beat up thugs, it still looks very stylish

For the first time in the series, there is also a multiplayer - which supports up to eight players. But this afterthought is not likely to win over new fans to the franchise.

Nor, sadly, will the predictable single player.

Still, Arkham Origins is a solid game...even though it may be time to draw this saga to a close...

Batman: Arkham Origins is out now.
