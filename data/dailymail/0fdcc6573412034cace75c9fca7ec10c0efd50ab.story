Katie Hopkins has been shopped to the police for hate crimes against overweight people. 

The controversial TV star was reported by a woman belonging to a 'fat activist' group during filming for her new programme on TLC, in which she gains and loses three stone in six months.

Katie was accused of the crime when she met up with the group of five women in London who all work independently as plus-size activists or diet bloggers, so that she could hear opposing views on her claims that 'fat people are lazy'.

The panel included size acceptance campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki, burlesque performer Khandie Kisses, blogger 'Big Fat Betty', editor of Slink magazine Rivkie Baum and vlogger Thandi Ejindu, who lost 11 stone in one year.

The discussion between Katie and the women quickly heated up and size acceptance campaigner Ms Szrodecki is seen storming out of the room to call the police in the second episode from the series, which is set to air on Saturday.

Ms Szrodecki began to get upset after Katie questioned how she could be healthy because of the weight she was carrying.

The former Apprentice contestant told her: 'I’m looking at you and I’m making an assessment that it is not healthy to carry that much weight on your knees.'

She continued: 'I just don’t believe you’re healthy in that state.

'The cost to the NHS is more than six billion a year, and the Chief Surgeon at Guy’s Hospital said “It’s killing millions, costing billions, and the cure is in our hands”, and as a tax payer that’s why I feel I do have a say, it's because I’m paying for your health.'

Katie then turns her attention to another member of the group and asks her: 'Can I ask you something? And you, and you can answer it honestly, or not answer it at all, is why are you big?' 

The woman replies: 'Because I eat too much.'

Ms Szrodecki then interjects and says to Katie: 'Do you not realise where you’re going with this? This is actually to do with a hate crime.'

Katie then laughs and replies: 'You’re a victim of hate crime?' 

Ms Szrodecki says: 'Absolutely. And can we call the police?'

Katie then tells her: 'Do call the police, there’s a telephone right there, feel free. 

'Would you like it brought to you? Because it’s probably going to be hard to walk there.'

Ms Szrodecki walks outside with her mobile phone and can be seen speaking to the police about Katie. She says: 'Yes, it became personally offensive. And I believe it is a hate crime and I’d like to report it.’

But after the meeting, Katie is unrepentant about upsetting Kathryn. 

She tells cameras: 'They’re irritated that I have a voice, one of them even threatened to go and call the police, so I told her to go and do that. 

'But, no police came, which was disappointing as I quite like a man in a uniform.'

The argument is seen in the second episode of Katie's new show, with the first part airing on Friday night.  

Over six months, Katie went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit. 

The journey was all captured on camera for the documentary.

The documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story follows Katie Hopkins as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise 

Katie caused an uproar last year, when she told an obese woman on This Morning that she wouldn't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy. 

But she decided to put her money where her mouth is with her latest project, by gaining and losing 3st to prove that overweight people are unwilling - rather than unable - to lose weight.

The weight gain hit Katie's emotions harder than she expected, with the mother-of-three was often reduced to tears over her size, especially when she caught sight of herself in the mirror.

She recently told The Sun that she even refused to have sex with her husband Mark Cross after she had gained the first stone, because she felt so unattractive,  

Previously a slim size eight, weighing in at 8st 12lb at 5ft 7in, the 39-year-old gained nearly 3st by gorging on 6,500 calories a day and severely limiting her movement.

With an apparently naturally high metabolism, Katie struggles to bring her weight up over 11st despite her high-calorie intake.

The documentary sees her draft in ex-Army personal trainer Christian who devises a military-style program of what he terms 'circuit eating' to help her gain the final pounds.

Dividing a table into four, Christian places different foods in each section and makes Katie rotate the table six times, eating the small but high calorie foods at each point.

Similar in form to exercise circuits, the idea is to maximise calorie intake, and the circuits have to be repeated every two hours.

After one particular feed, clearly uncomfortable with a distended stomach, Katie rants: 'It is just ridiculous what people do to themselves. Fat people, I mean really I don't know how they look at themselves in the mirror.'  

The documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, follows Katie after she's at her peak weight of 11st 13lb, with a 38in waist and a BMI of 26, and then slims down thanks to a strict diet and exercise regime.

In the show, we see the usually polished star in her unguarded moments.

Make-up free and in a pair of striped pyjamas, Hopkins breaks down over her larger body.

After a weight-gain diet that included daily 'snacks' of a litre-and-a-half of Mars milk drink, an entire tub of Pringles, cheese on toast, Dairy Milk and Galaxy chocolate and the inclusion of a second breakfast, Katie then cuts her calories to a mere 1,500.

As well as a low fat diet of porridge, salads and lean chicken with a jacket potato, Hopkins upped her daily steps from 1,000 to 20,000 daily and introduced several hour-long runs a week.

Following this self-devised plan she managed to drop down to 9st 12lb in just three months, shedding a further 6lb after the documentary ended.

The controversial figure claims that while she didn't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children, gaining 3st 'killed her' and left her in constant floods

Katie kept a video diary during the making of the programme and regularly recorded her  strong views on fat people.

One video sees her explaining: 'One of the things about being fat and eating all the time is you find you don't want to go out so much. You feel like you don't really want to go out because you can't fit into the things you would like to wear.

'I'm not sure if that's something many fat people suffer from because I see a lot of fat people out and about. Whether that's out of choice I don't know but I'm surprised that fat people go out at all.' 

But despite the hardships that she suffered after gaining weight, Katie maintains that she still wouldn't employ a fat person. 

She also told a national newspaper earlier this week that she would like to see a radical weight-loss scheme implemented in schools, which would see children weighed on the premises. 

The fattest 10 per cent of children would then be reported to social services.   

 

The controversial former reality star has been as active  on Twitter, defending her views on being overweight

Katie first embarked on the weight-gain and weight-loss scheme after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size.

Speaking on ITV's This Morning in September she said: 'One in ten of our children are starting school overweight or obese and one in three children who are 15 or over are overweight or obese.

'People have always said to me, "You're lucky, you're skinny," and I just don't think these excuses are cutting it any more.

'I saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat. I just thought, we have to put an end to this.' 

While she now has greater sympathy for people with weight issues, Katie is continuing to be outspoken on the topics, using her Twitter account to make digs at larger people in her neighbourhood. 

She recently tweeted: 'My local over/under active thyroid self help group meets in KFC.'

She also posted: 'I see you all down there with your excuses, but a third of the planet is obese. The first step to slim is NO EXCUSES. Own your problem.'

Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, airs Friday and Saturday, 2 and 3 January at 9pm on TLC.
