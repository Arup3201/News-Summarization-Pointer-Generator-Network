An alcoholic with a history of violence escaped prison by apologising to his wife for brutally attacking her – then beat her to death weeks later.

Now police forces have been ordered to stop the practice of ‘restorative justice’ because of fears that domestic abusers have such control over their victims that they can force them to accept an apology.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal the new guidelines were brought in after the horrific case of Charles Forster, who was violent towards Susan, his wife of 28 years.

Forster had been visited by Durham Police four times but was never prosecuted. On April 20, 2011, officers visited the couple’s home near Bishop Auckland after one of their children reported her mother had a badly bruised face.

Mrs Forster, 51, tearfully told a female constable that her alcoholic husband had pushed her during an argument, causing her to bang her head. 

But she did not want to press charges, and as Forster appeared to be ‘remorseful’ police dealt with the incident by way of restorative justice.

But just 27 days later, Forster murdered his long-suffering wife, who worked as a carer. A neighbour heard him shouting ‘Get up off the floor’ and ‘I’m going to f****** kill you’. Through a window, the neighbour saw him hitting her with his metal walking stick.

Mrs Forster was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene on May 17, and was later found to have suffered 11 broken ribs as well as 21 injuries to her head and neck. 

Forster, then 63, was given a minimum jail term of 13 years. He died behind bars last month.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission investigated and although it did not blame any officers for what happened, it made a series of national recommendations to ensure nothing similar could happen again. 

Commissioner Cindy Butts said last night: ‘It was of significant concern to us that there was a conflict in two force policies that allowed restorative justice to be used to deal with the assault claim made a month before Susan Forster was murdered.

‘I hope this national recommendation will allow forces to learn lessons from this.’

All forces were told by the Association of Chief Police Officers last year that ‘restorative justice should not be used as an alternative to prosecution until alternative ways of dealing with domestic abuse have been thoroughly evaluated’. 

But HM Inspectorate of Constabulary reported this year that some forces were still ‘routinely’ allowing wife-beaters to get away with saying sorry.

Durham Police said: ‘This incident is still subject to a serious case review. It would not be appropriate to comment.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘It is not acceptable to use restorative justice in cases of domestic abuse.’
