Jordan Belfort has revealed that he will spend the next year working to pay off the millions of dollars of debt he owes his previous investors.

The real-life Wolf of Wall Street said that he aims to make $100 million over the next year in a non-stop road tour across the United States.

The motivational speaker confirmed that exactly half of what he makes will be given to the U.S. government in restitution.

Jordan Belfort says he will pay back $50 million of the $110 million he owes his previous investors after a motivational speaking tour of the US

The real life Wolf of Wall Street plans to keep any money he earns during his Australian tour, kicking off in June

It will go towards the $110 million he owes to his 1513 victims as part of his sentencing agreement, after spending only 22 months in jail in 2004 for fraud and money laundering.

'It's an amazing thing for me that I am having this opportunity to pay it back,' Belfort told the Sunday Telegraph.

'It takes the redemption story for myself to a whole different level. I am doing it because it's the right thing to do.'

So far, The Wolf has only paid back $11.6 million to investors.

But any money he earns during his Australian tour, kicking off in June, will go straight into his pocket.

The former stockbroker was recently brought to life on the big screen as Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed him in The Wolf Of Wall Street

This is despite him being convicted of raking in $200 million from his Long Island-based brokerage, Stratton Oakmont, during the late 1980s and 90s.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission shut down Belfort's firm in 1998 and he was then convicted and sentenced to four years in jail in 2003.

But Belford won't stop trying to make the big bucks once his debt is paid, saying that he'll probably continue to work, but just at a slower pace.

'It's more about focusing about lifestyle, family, charitable stuff. I still love to have fun, to travel, to drink occasionally. I am not going to let loose with a bag of cocaine and three hookers, I think I have grown out of that,' he said.
