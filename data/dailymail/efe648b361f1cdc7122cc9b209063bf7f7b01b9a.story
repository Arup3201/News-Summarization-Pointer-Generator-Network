A five-year-old girl was reported to have been sexually assaulted by children her own age at a remote community.

Detective Superintendent Brent Warren told the ABC that two boys, aged five and six, allegedly led the indecent assault which was reported by a parent at Alice Springs last month.

However he said officers were focusing more on the children's home environment to determine what could have led to the behaviour, confirming that the young girl was not taken to hospital.

'Once we investigated and started asking questions about what happened and talking to the young people involved, it became clear that yes there was some sexualised talking and some sexualised behaviour,' Superintendent Warren told the ABC.

'[It was] the kind of incident that we have to refer onto other people to provide a more therapeutic involvement.'

It comes just a few days after the Northern Territory's chief minister accused the media of ignoring the alleged rape of a seven-year-old Aboriginal girl in the Northern Territory and implied the reporting was racist.

The incident was reported  on March 8 by the ABC which reported that an Aboriginal girl at a town camp outside of Alice Springs had been raped.

It comes after  NT chief minister Adam Giles (pictured) accused the media of not reporting on the rape of an Aboriginal minor because the child was not 'a blonde-haired, blue eyed little girl'

In a two-sentence media release the following day, NT Police media wrote: 'Alice Springs Police have arrested and charged a 29-year-old man following the sexual assault of a minor.'

'He was refused bail overnight, to appear in Alice Springs Magistrates Court today (Tuesday).'

No further information was released.

However, during parliament on Tuesday the chief minister Adam Giles accused the media of not reporting the story because the child was not 'a blonde-haired, blue eyed little girl.'

'The saddest part is it was a little blip on the media radar. It raised a few column inches and it disappeared,' he said.

Opposition Leader Delia Lawrie (pictured) was quick to defend reporters, labelling Mr Giles accusations as 'heinous' and pointing out that minimal information was available about the case

'One can only think that if it was a blonde-haired blue-eyed little girl it would have made the front page of media around the country.

'But a little Aboriginal kid in the Hidden Valley town camp ... it's just not been noticed and I think it's quite disgusting.'

Acting Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw stood by the timing of the sparse media release

Opposition Leader Delia Lawrie was quick to defend reporters, labelling Mr Giles accusations as 'heinous' and pointing out that minimal information was available about the case.

'Don't blame people who weren't provided information from the very government that is now seeking to blame them,' she said.

'I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot of pressure on police in terms of what goes out in the media domain, that fits with the culture of cover-up in the (Country Liberal Party).'

Police Minister Peter Chandler denied the government was leaning on police not to release information on crime if it was politically uncomfortable.

'Absolutely not,' he said.

'If anybody thinks things are being held back or hidden, that's good for nobody.'

Acting Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw stood by the timing of the sparse media release. 

He said police took great care in making sure that when action was taken it was correct and would not prejudice any case before the courts.

He would not comment on the chief minister using such a sensitive issue as a 'political football'.

Earlier Mr Giles announced the alleged rape had sparked crisis talks on town camps.

All government agencies involved in delivering services and law enforcement at town camps across Alice Springs and Tennant Creek will meet at a closed forum on Friday to discuss safety and living conditions and the performance of government and private organisations providing services.
