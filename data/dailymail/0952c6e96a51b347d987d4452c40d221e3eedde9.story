Tragedy: Authorities have confirmed that the remains Avonte Oquendo, 14, have been found

Human remains found washed up on a New York beach do belong to missing autistic teenager Avonte Oquendo, the New York City medical examiner's office has confirmed.

The identification of the remains, using DNA taken from the 14-year-old's family, was made as his mother, Vanessa Fontaine, said she plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the city.

Attorney David Perecman said he will file
 the legal claim on behalf of the family of Avonte, whose 
remains were found at the edge of the East River last week.

A decomposed torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker 
were found on a northern Queens beach last Thursday and authorities said
 the clothes were similar to those worn by the 14-year-old when he went 
missing in October.  

The city's medical examiner's office announced on Tuesday that the remains belong to Avonte, but said it needed further time to determine the cause and manner of his death.

Mr Perecman said Ms Fontaine was inconsolable after being notified of the findings on Tuesday afternoon.

The news brings the three-month search for the missing student to a devastating conclusion for his family, who had rallied hundreds of volunteers to try to find him after he ran away from Riverview High School in Long Island City on October 4.

The family first said in October that they would sue the city claiming he was not supervised properly.

On Monday, the family said that, if the body was identified as Avonte's, they feared foul play because it was wearing unfamiliar underwear.

The family's lawyer, Mr Perecman, told the New York Post that he is concerned about the large Fruit of the Loom underwear found on the remains because Avonte didn't wear 'large' and wore only the Hanes brand.

Search: An arm, torso and legs were discovered along the Queens shoreline on Thursday and authorities said the clothes found were similar to those worn by Avonte when he vanished three months ago

Avonte Oquendo disappeared from his Long Island City school, New York on October 4. The remains were found on a Queens beach nine miles from where he was last seen

'If it is him, what that indicates to 
me is that something happened,' Mr Perecman said on Monday, before the 
confirmation of identity. 'Someone got a hold of him, moved him. I can't
 say they harmed him, but why would the underwear have gotten changed?'

The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen.

For months, the boy's family organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing 
posters on the subway and in stores and raised a $95,000 reward.

In
 particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager was fascinated 
with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even 
played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy.

Unknown: Avonte is seen on the street outside his school on October 4 before he turned the corner and disappeared out of sight. After his disappearance, his family launched a massive search

The
 14-year-old was thought to be particularly vulnerable because his type 
of autism left him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care.

There were a few sightings of 
teenage boys who closely resembled Avonte, raising the family's hopes as they continued to search.

A Department of Education investigation was also launched into how the autistic boy managed to get out of his special needs school and how teaching staff handled his disappearance.

Avonte's
 mother, along with police, were not informed of his disappearance until
 at least an hour after he ran from the school building.

The
 school failed to go into lockdown mode and none of the administrators
 had passwords to access the surveillance cameras at the school on the 
day of Avonte's disappearance, according to Capital New York.

Without
 access to the security footage, school officials originally believed 
Avonte 'ran back up another staircase' and remained in the building.

The family first said in October that 
it would sue the city. At the time, Education Chancellor Dennis Walcott 
declined to respond to the family's criticisms.

The city's law department didn't immediately comment Tuesday, but it has previously called the matter distressing.
