Edward VIII thought he might have been able to prevent the Second World War if he had not abdicated as King, according to a letter he wrote which has just come to light.

The unique document also reveals the controversial ex-monarch's thoughts about Winston Churchill, who he thought showed 'brilliant leadership' during the War but was a poor 'peace time politician'.

The former King had controversial links with Adolf Hitler, whom he visited in 1937, and is thought to have had fascist sympathies.

In a letter to outspoken Right-wing author Gerald Hamilton, Edward - who was by this time the 75-year-old Duke of Windsor - questioned whether Britain could have avoided war if he had still been on the throne.

The note was written in January 1970 from the home in Paris which the Duke shared with his wife Wallis Simpson, to thank Hamilton for sending the couple a copy of his latest book for Christmas.

'Whether or not I could have prevented World War II, had I remained King, is an imponderable,' Edward wrote. 'At least I used any influence I had to warn against the folly of another hollocaust [sic].'

The Duke and Duchess were warned against visiting Hitler in 1937, but they ignored official advice and paid a trip to the Fuhrer's country retreat.

Hitler believed that Britain would not have declared war on Germany if Edward had remained King, and there have been rumours that he planned to depose George VI and reinstate his brother on the throne of a fascist Britain.

The former King told a friend years after the war that he 'never thought Hitler was such a bad chap', while he and Wallis are widely believed to have been sympathetic to the fascist cause.

Hamilton, to whom he wrote in 1970, had 
even more extreme views, and was interned by the British government 
during both World Wars.

Edward used the letter to describe how 
he had 'clashed' with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin during his short 
reign, which began and ended in 1936.

'Where I clashed with Baldwin and his cronies was that I was not really of the Establishment which I was supposed to be,' he said. 'That aroused their suspicions that I would not always "yes" them, which indeed I would not have!'

He added: 'Your diagnosis of Winston Churchill is perfect. Great orator and writer, yes, and imbued with insatiable ambition. No outstanding peace time politician; only war seemed to inspire him to brilliant leadership.'

Churchill was a strong supporter of Edward during the abdication crisis, urging him to stay on the throne and helping to draft his resignation speech.

Clashes: Edward failed to get on with Stanley Baldwin, right, because he frequently disagreed with him

The letter from the Duke to Hamilton 
is being sold this week by Nottingham-based International Autograph 
Auctions on behalf of a private collector, and is predicted to fetch 
Â£8,000.

Hugo Vickers, 
an expert on the Royal Family, said: 'Gerald Hamilton was quite a 
controversial character and one that the Duke of Windsor would have 
loved to have been involved with.

'The idea that the Duke was an anti-establishment figure was one he liked to bandy about, especially in his later years, as we can see in this letter.

'The line about whether he could have prevented war breaking out is an interesting one. In 1937 Edward went to Germany to see Hitler on the advice of someone high up in the U.S. embassy in London.

'Edward honestly thought he could talk Hitler out of war which was pretty stupid but he felt that he had given it his best shot.

'It is a fascinating letter as it shows the Duke rewriting history as he wanted it remembered.'

Controversy: Edward abdicated the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson

This is not the first letter to come to light this year written by Edward VIII, who took the throne after the death of his father George V and abdicated in favour of his brother George VI in order to marry Mrs Simpson, an American divorcee.

In September, a letter typed by Edward emerged in which he complained that he had been ordered to stay away from London in the wake of his abdication.

And last month, a note to his first lover Freda Dudley Ward went on sale, revealing his frustrations at having to miss a tryst with her in order to go to the opera with his family.

Dear Mr Hamilton,

I have to apologise for the delay in thanking you 
very much for your letter of December 15, 1969, and for sending me a 
copy of your latest book The Way It Was With Me.

Both The Duchess and
 I have read it with great interest and some nostalgia and in special 
appreciation of your favorable [sic] references to us in Chapter 12, 
page 9.

Whether or not I could have prevented World War II, had I 
remained King, is an imponderable. At least I used any influence I had 
to warn against the folly of another hollocaust [sic]. Where I clashed 
with Baldwin and his cronies was that I was not really of the 
Establishment which I was supposed to be. That aroused their suspicions 
that I would not always "yes" them, which indeed I would not have!

Your
 diagnosis of Winston Churchill is perfect. Great orator and writer, 
yes, and imbued with insatiable ambition. No outstanding peace time 
politician; only war seemed to inspire him to brilliant leadership. He 
was a man without fear, and as he once told me, he was never bored.

Thanking you again for providing such enjoyable reading and with The Duchess and my best wishes for this New Year.

Sincerely Yours,Edward, Duke of Windsor
