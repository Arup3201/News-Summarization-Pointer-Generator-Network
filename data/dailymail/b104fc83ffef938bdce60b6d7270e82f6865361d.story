Myleene Klass's boyfriend is bound to be looking forward to next Saturday. 

The singer has launched a new range of underwear inspired by Valentine's Day. 

Myleene, 36, used the bikini body made famous during her stint on I'm A Celebrity to model the new capsule collection for Littlewoods. 

The range features strappy detailing, feather embroidery and sexy suspender sets, all perfect for the upcoming romantic weekend.

Myleene Klass has launched a new lingerie collection for Littlewoods just in time for Valentine's Day

Myleene said of the designs: 'I design my lingerie to look good underneath clothes and without them.

'The most important thing for me is that women feel empowered and confident when wearing my designs, whatever the occasion.'

Littlewoods works with a range of celebrities, including Coleen Rooney, Fearne Cotton and Kimberley Walsh, but Myleene is consistently one of the online retailer's best-sellers. 

Ben Cooper, Head of Consumer PR at Littlewoods said: 'Myleene Klass knows what women want from their underwear and uses this to design what they need.'

The three-piece collection comes in red, black and cream and in sizes 8-18, 32B-40E, with prices ranging from £13-£35. 

The new collection is a victory for Myleene after she was faced with a bizarre petition calling for Littlewoods to drop her as a designer last November. 

It came after the mother-of-two criticised Ed Miliband for Labour's proposed mansion tax on the TV show The Agenda.

The founder of the petition on Change.org accused Myleene of class insensitivity and claimed that her Littlewoods customers were some of the hardest-hit Brits in the recent economic downturn. 

They said: 'Myleene Klass has demonstrated unacceptable conduct and spoken unacceptably publicly in such appalling economic times. 

'We the British public call upon you (Littlewoods) to make you position regarding the words of Myleene Klass clear and end your business relationship with her as the face of your brand.' 

But the petition was widely derided and only managed to attract 8,978 signatures.
