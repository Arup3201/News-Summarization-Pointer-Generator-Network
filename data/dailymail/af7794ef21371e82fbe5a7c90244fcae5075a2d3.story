Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich players looked in high spirits as they took on the 'tin alley' challenge. 

Pepe Reina teamed up with Claudio Pizarro in the light-hearted game against Thomas Muller and Philipp Lahm.

The purpose of the challenge was to knock down a pyramid of cans that were placed on the goal line at the Munich training base.
