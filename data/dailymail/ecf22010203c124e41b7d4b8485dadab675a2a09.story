He may have left the WAGs behind, but England coach Roy Hodgson has made one concession sure to please his players training in Miami for the World Cup.

Tomato ketchup and brown sauce are back on the menu after being banned by former boss Fabio Capello.

The World Cup campaign in South Africa four years ago was strictly sauceless as the Italian coach frowned on the high salt and sugar content of the condiments.

England coach Roy Hodgson will allow his Brazil 2014 team to eat ketchup and brown sauce - both of which were banned by Fabio Capello in South Africa four years ago

But with the England players losing so much sweat training in the heat and humidity of Florida to prepare for the conditions they will face in Brazil, Hodgson has decided a little extra salt and sugar from the sauces will do no harm.

Butter – previously banned for its high salt and fat content – is also back on the menu.

Even in the cooler climes of Portugal and Burton-upon-Trent, the England management have tried to recreate Amazonian conditions by making the players wear several layers so they sweat more.

And Foster has also revealed that the players have been put through 'brutal' sessions on exercise bikes in saunas to improve their fitness.

Due to the high humidity in both the Miami training ground and in Brazil, the coach says high salt and sugar levels in ketchup will not do any harm to his squad

'When we were in Portugal we wore underarmour, t-shirts, zip up tops and a wet top over that,' the England goalkeeper said.

'When it was 22 degrees (centigrade) the lads were losing 2kg in sweat in every training session.

'We are trying to replicate the heat and humidity (of Brazil)

'Even at St George's Park last week we trained in the morning, lunch, slept for an hour and then did bike sessions in heat chambers to get ready.

'We've been doing half hour sessions in there. It's brutal, really hard work. But no-one's grumbled or moaned about it, just got on with it.'

Roy Hodgson has left no stone unturned in his bid to get the players in the best possible condition for the World Cup.

The England boss has brought a psychiatrist, sports scientists, fitness coaches and a nutritionist along with him to Miami and they will all stop with the team until they are eliminated from the World Cup.

Much to Foster's joy, England will be allowed tomato ketchup and brown sauce - both banned under Fabio Capello - during the tournament.

'We are allowed (ketchup and brown sauce) now,' said the West Brom stopper, who will start against Ecuador on Wednesday.

'The food is amazing. There are seven or eight different stations of everything you could want.'
