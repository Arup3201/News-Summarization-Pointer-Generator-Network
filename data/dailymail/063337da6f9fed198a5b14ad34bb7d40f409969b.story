Australians eat more than any other nation when they set sail on fancy cruise holidays, it has been claimed.

Sydney-based travel writer Amanda Woods learned some ships actually stock up on more food when they know a large bunch of Aussies are coming on board.

Woods made the discovery in December 2013 while holidaying in the South Pacific on MS Oosterdam, a Holland America ship.

Speaking with a tour guide on board, she was told they always had to 'order more' food when Australians come on board.

'The cruise I was on had more Australians on than ever before. We were going out of Sydney,' Woods told Daily Mail Australia.

It was the first time the experienced traveller had cruised out of an Australian port and travelled with a group of Aussies. 

'It's all inclusive. You pay for alcohol prices but they are often better than on land and it's so easy the food is there all the time.'

Ms Woods was allowed into the kitchens of MS Oosterdam to see the fine food being prepared

'I enjoyed the omelette and club sandwich so much that I ended up having them both in my cabin twice, and didn’t get around the rest of In Room Dining menu,' Ms Woods said

She explained 'cocktail happy hours' were her weakness, with low cost prices meaning she was only spending $6 or $7 for a cocktail. 'It was cheaper than a beer in Sydney,' she laughed. 

Ms Woods said she develops 'cruise curves', while another passenger told her they take scales on board to monitor any weight gain.

'We were all laughing about how much we were overeating,' she added.

Writing on her blog Ms Woods explained: 'There's something about stepping on board a cruise ship that makes normal eating – and drinking – patterns just fly out the stateroom window. Sure, there are those who nibble on salads and actually go to the gym, but for the rest of us it's a case of "I'm on holiday, I should enjoy my food" to the power of a curvy 10.'

'Second or third helpings at breakfast followed by a three-course lunch, an afternoon tea or ice cream (or both) and then a four-course dinner with a cheese chaser are perfectly acceptable. In fact, it feels like it would be a waste not to take advantage of such a bounty of food. Especially when so many of your fellow cruisers (or should that be enablers?) are doing the same,' she added.

Amused by the idea that her fellow countrymen were making a name for themselves as the greediest guests, the travel writer did some further research and found that coffee, salmon and gin and tonic are some of the particular items that ships stock up on when they know Aussies are travelling.

Cruise ship company Carnival claimed in 2013 that 'when they have Australians on board coffee orders are up 500 per cent compared to Americans,' Ms Woods remarked.

'There’s something about stepping on board a cruise ship that makes normal eating – and drinking – patterns just fly out the stateroom window,' Ms Woods explained

'They make lots of flat whites,' she laughed.

'When they are coming out of Australia the Carnival Spirit also has to put 10 kg of salmon a day on extra.

'And the number of gin and tonics drunk also goes up 200 per cent over the Americans,' she said.

Ms Woods documented her trip on Holland America's Ms Oosterdam on her blog Adventures All Around, where she posted examples of the food she devoured on board.

'There was this insane desert, this crème brulee, it was super fancy,' she said.

'Everything on there was insane, you pay 10 dollars for lunch and 25 dollars for dinner,' she explained.

Ms Woods' South Pacific cruise visited exotic places such as Fiji and New Caledonia and she then had 'the joy of coming into Sydney harbour'.

'Everyone gets up at 5.30am in the morning as you come in to the harbour when the sun is rising through the heads,' she said.

A spokesperson for Holland America told Daily Mail Australia: 'The comment that was made on the galley tour was very anecdotal and wasn't based on any official fact.'
