We know that dogs are man's best friend, but could it be that they're best friends with other animals too?

Here, Bella the dog is dealing with the loss of her good friend Beavis, a beaver.

It might seem like an unusual partnership but apparently when he was alive, the best-buddies were virtually inseparable.

Scroll down for video...

Companions: Bella, the dog, played with Beavis, the Beaver to the very end and appeared to be heartbroken after the his death

Bella’s owner, who posted the video on YouTube, says Bella and Beavis played ball together, shared living quarters, and ate together too.

'They lived and loved together for quite a while. Beavis died this morning, and Bella has been in mourning for hours.'

Bella whimpers as she struggles to comprehend the fact her friend is gone.

Other dogs appear in the video who don't seem to care, happy to chase balls and wag their tails, but for Bella at least, the death of Beavis seems to have affected her deeply. 

Loyal: While other dogs were playing with balls and wagging their tails, Bella stayed firm by Beavis' side for hours

Heartbreaking: It's hard not to bring human emotions into something that might seems so natural to most of us yet more unusual to the animal kingdom

Right till the end: Bella stuck by Beavis for hours - barely able to comprehend that her friend was no longer going to be around

To humans, it looks as though she's grieving as she is seen licking and nuzzling the motionless beaver, remaining at its side like a loyal companion.

'I love it when even animals show their love for other,' wrote one YouTube user  after watching the clip.

'Aww, it went from cute to sad and then﻿ touching. It's a wake-up call to cherish life,' wrote another.
