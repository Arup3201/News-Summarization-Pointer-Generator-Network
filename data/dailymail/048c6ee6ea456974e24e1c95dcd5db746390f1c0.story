Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has admitted paying a banker £27million to stay silent over the tycoon's complex financial affairs.

The billionaire had previously denied making any payment to Gerhard Gribkowsky, the German banker at the centre of a huge fraud trial.

But yesterday he admitted to a packed Munich courtroom that he had paid him around £27million – because he was being blackmailed.

He claimed Gribkowsky was threatening to make false accusations to the Inland Revenue about his tax affairs which would cost him 'billions' even though he was innocent.

Prosecutors have accused Mr Ecclestone, the fourth richest man in Britain, of paying the banker to fix a deal involving the sale of F1 shares on terms which were favourable to him.

As a result of the deal arranged by Gribkowsky, Mr Ecclestone was paid five per cent commission – or £27million. But the F1 boss said a payment of £27million he subsequently made to Gribkowsky was because of the blackmail.

Mr Ecclestone said he paid the banker the money not to do 'silly things'. He told the court: 'I really did not have any alternative.

'I was under the impression he might have given some information to the Revenue in England which I did not know much about. If he had done and the Revenue had investigated and been successful it would have been extremely expensive.'

He added: 'My fear was he would do something. I thought I could keep him peaceful and quiet and not do silly things.'

The admission that Mr Ecclestone, 81,
 paid Gribkowsky will raise further questions about the business affairs
 of the flamboyant billionaire, which have always been shrouded in 
mystery.

The tycoon has not been charged with any offence but his admission places him at the heart of the corruption case.

It centres around the 2005 sale of F1
 shares by Gribkowsky's former employer, the German bank BayernLB, to 
the London-based private equity group Citicorp Venture Capital, CVC.

Gribkowsky, who engineered the deal, was charged with fraud after he was
 found to have £27million in an Austrian bank account following the 
deal's completion.

Prosecutors claim this money was 
given to him by Ecclestone as a bribe for securing favourable terms for 
the F1 boss. Mr Ecclestone denies this.

Following the sale of BayernLB's F1 
stake to CVC, Mr Ecclestone was appointed chief executive of the equity 
group and was able to retain his controlling influence over F1.

Mr Ecclestone said the £27million 
commission he received was for facilitating the deal and giving the bank
 assurances that F1 was in rude health.

Mr Gribkowsky denies all charges against him. The case continues.
