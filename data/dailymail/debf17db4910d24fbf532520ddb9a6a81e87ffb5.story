Week after week she showcases some serious sartorial wardrobe choices and it seems that Cheryl Fernandez-Versini can mostly do no wrong in the style stakes.

But last night, as she took to the stage to perform her new single, Cheryl's outfit received mixed reviews on social media.

The revealing white creation, which revealed her toned dancer's physique, was masterminded by her stylist, Anna Hughes-Chamberlain, and crafted by couture wedding dress designer, Alida Herbst.

Under fire: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's outfit came under attack on last night's X Factor with many social media users comparing it to toilet roll. FEMAIL caught up with the woman who made it to find out all the design details

Anna, who is the senior fashion editor of Hunger magazine, has styled the likes of Miranda Kerr, Sienna Miller and Ellie Goulding, and dresses Cheryl every week with the help of Alida.

However, it seems that the Twittersphere wasn't so impressed with the design.

One user wrote: 'Dreadful accident with loo roll there,' whilst another posted a picture of the Andrex puppy with the caption: 'Cheryl's stylist speaks out.'

FEMAIL caught up with Alida Herbst, who crafted the outfit, to find out the exact thought process behind the design.

'I have worked with Cheryl's stylist Anna and Cheryl herself many times before. I designed her outfit for the Capital FM Summertime Ball at Wembley earlier this year and created about 25 dresses for her Girls Aloud Ten tour,' Alida told us. 

Anna apparently came to Alida with a mood board and they worked together for under a week crafting the design.

'I worked on it all day every day,' said Alida. 'It was embellished with thousands of crystals and I also applied all of the crystals to her boots as well.'

Alida, who goes along to the lives shows every week to help Cheryl and Anna, said that Cheryl is 'lovely' to work with and has a really good sense of humour.

'Cheryl has been looking so good on X Factor,' added Alida.

In response to the harsh comments, she admits she doesn't read social media but says: 'You can't please everyone, I did the best I could.'

While Alida didn't disclose the price of the bespoke creation, she says she is given a budget to work with - and it's in the thousands. 

Speaking about her look, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'It's not bad enough that Cheryl reportedly mimed on a supposedly "live" singing competition, but her stylist then goes and designs her something Andrex would be ashamed of! I just don't get it.

'Cheryl has a great figure, but this weird white look just does NOTHING for her. It makes her look like a rectangle, straight up and down. Maybe if that handkerchief thing fell off then we'd see her curves.

'Look closely though, and you'll also see there are lots of little crystals embellished all over it. Why you'd want to make this rag shine I don't know.

'And the boots. NOT chic. A strange choice for someone who often wins the best in show when it comes to the fash-off between her and Mel.

'Just like the title of her song - I don't care... for this strange stage look.'

Speaking out: It seems a lot of Twitter users weren't impressed with Cheryl's outfit on last night's show

Ignorance is bliss: Alida says she doesn't read social media but realises you can't please everyone
