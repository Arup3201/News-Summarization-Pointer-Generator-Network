The Northeast is forecast to experience stormy weather Wednesday to Friday this week, with the arrival of a nor'easter.

New England may see powerful winds, rainfall, as well as flooding along the coast due to the storm, The Weather Channel reported. 

Several New England states have flood watches, including Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine, according to the channel.  

Get ready! Rain and wind are forecast to hit multiple states during the nor'easter

On the waterfront: A waterspout was seen in New Jersey Tuesday afternoon 

By Wednesday at 9pm, New York City may see winds between 15 and 20 miles per hour, and Boston may see winds between 25 and 30 miles per hour, the channel reported.

However, even more powerful winds may be on the way.  

'The strongest northeast winds will likely be found from northeast Massachusetts to Down East Maine with sustained winds of 25 to 40 mph and gusts up to 50 mph,' The Weather Channel reported.

It also said that 'The heaviest rain should occur in eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine with widespread totals of one to three inches, with up to five inches in some spots.' 

New Jersey saw rain and some flooding on Tuesday 

Northern neighbor: Canada is also expected to experience flooding from the nor'easter 

Soaking wet: New Hampshire and Maine residents may see as many as five inches of rain 

In New York City, thunderstorms and potential flooding are forecast for Wednesday, with 'Rain tapering off' on Thursday, Accuweather reported. 

Leaves stuck in storm drains and streams, as well as those left on the road, may also be risks for the nor'easter, the website said.

Canada is also expected to be affected by the nor'easter. 

A waterspout was seen Tuesday afternoon near New Jersey's Seaside Heights, The Asbury Park Press reported.

'It was fairly brief,' National Weather Service meteorologist Mitchell Gaines told the newspaper. 'We did get some photographic evidence to determine there was a waterspout at that location.'

Flooding was also seen in both Monmouth County and Ocean County, the newspaper said.
