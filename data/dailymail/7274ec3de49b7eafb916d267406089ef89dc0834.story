An Indianapolis traffic reporter took a tumble on air on Thursday as she was updating viewers on road conditions - but she still managed to finish her report. 

CBS4 traffic reporter Katie Solove was pointing at the screen when she stepped backward and stumbled to the ground off screen. 

She disappeared, paused for a moment and then continued with the news cast.

CBS4 traffic reporter Katie Solove was reporting on the roads in the area when she took a tumble on live TV

Solove was walking backward and pointing at the monitor when she apparently missed a step and fell off screen

In the background of the video a voice can be heard shouting, 'Whoa!' before Solove professionally finished her report. 

Solove then laughed and the camera cut to the two main news anchors, one of which turned to the viewers and said, 'Katie's OK'. 

She wasn't injured in the fall and later went to Twitter to laugh about her accident. 

'FAILURE... IS an option lol but u can always get up & keep going! Traffic now back to normal speeds at @CBS4Indy,' she wrote. 

She handled the situation professionally, however, and continued her traffic report and laughed about the moment on Twitter
