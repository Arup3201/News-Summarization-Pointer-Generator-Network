One is an eminent scientist whose life story has been turned into an acclaimed film that has won actor Eddie Redmayne an Oscar.

The other is a former self-employed businessman and father of three who enjoyed skiing, camping and hiking.

But Professor Stephen Hawking and Steve Isaac both battle with motor neurone disease, a degenerative illness that has left them unable to move or speak.

While professor Hawking, 73, has flourished despite his disability, writing the best-selling novel a Brief History of Time, Mr Isaac, 56, has reignited the debate on the right to die, telling a documentary he wants to end his life on his own terms.

Mr Isaac, who lives in Hampshire, has already been rendered unable to speak by his degenerative condition and like Professor Hawking, he relies on a computer system to communicate.

His works by moving a cursor with his eyes and blinking to type but doctors have told him his eyes could also give in to the disease, which causes paralysis, and Mr Isaac has made it clear that it is at this point he would not wish to continue living.

For four years Mr Isaac allowed his filmmaker son Fraser, 24, to record his decline in order to raise awareness about the illness and the truth about the devastating impact it has had on his family.

Appearing in Channel 5’s Filming My Father: In Life and Death , Mr Isaac, tells the camera: ‘If I am no longer able to communicate, so as to express my opinion, and this is verified on two occasions, 48-hours apart, by two doctors, then I would wish for my ventilation to be stopped and to manage my peaceful death.’

His wife of 30 years, Debbie, 55, said the achievements of Professor Hawking, make it harder for others with the disease who are expected to cope just as well with the condition and flourish.

After the film The Theory of Everything thrust the academic’s long life and success into the spotlight and won Redmayne, 33, an Academy Award for his portrayal of Hawking, Miss Isaac said people do not realise he is an ‘exceptional’ case.

Mr Isaac is the latest in a long line of terminally ill patients who have demanded for the right to end their lives, most notably Debbie Purdy, who died in December last year at the age of 51 after a year of refusing food.

She lived with multiple sclerosis for almost two decades and was a vocal campaigner for the ‘right to die’. Under current laws in England, it is an offence to encourage or assist anyone to commit suicide.

However, campaigners last night raised concerns that the programme could ‘normalise’ suicide for the disabled and said the focus should be on improving quality of life.

A spokesman for Care Not Killing said: ‘We have deep concerns about this programme. It’s vital that we do not normalise, in any way, suicide as an option for those who are disabled. 

'There are many people who are suffering from a whole raft of debilitating conditions who would be horrified at the suggestion that they should end their life. 

'What we need to be doing is focussing on how we ensure he has the very best quality of life and doesn’t feel like he is becoming a financial or care burden on his family or on society as a whole.’

While Mrs Isaac does not want to lose her husband and the father of her three children – Carly, 27, and twins Fraser and Hannah – she supports his wish to choose when and how he dies.

She told the Mail: ‘Steve should have what he wants. Either way I don’t like the idea of losing him but I believe strongly that it’s his life and he should have what he wants. You have all of these thoughts and emotions but at the end of the day it is down to him.

‘I can’t imagine what it will be like when we get to that but that’s what I believe. It’s his life and he should be able to choose.

The documentary follows Mr Isaac’s struggles from diagnosis in February 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in August 2014, hoping it would allow him to live a further three years

The family say the aim of the documentary, broadcast next Wednesday, is to increase awareness of the disease

‘The whole thing is quite surreal, having end of life conversations, but he’s open enough to talk about it and while he wants to live if he can’t communicate that’s the time he wants to end it. 

'You don’t get any practice at this, you’re just in it. There’s no way out and no happy ending. We know we’re going to lose him but as to how, if he can’t communicate that’s the time.’

But it is not a decision that sits easily with the whole family and Fraser reveals his concerns to the camera. He said: ‘He says he wants to be switched off after he can’t communicate but I can’t actually imagine doing the tests and being like “can you respond?” How do you judge what communication is?

‘For him to be completely himself and alive and for us to say okay, bye dad, you can’t communicate, and just turning off the machines. That to me is the worst way to go.’

The family say the aim of the documentary is to increase awareness of the disease. Mrs Isaac claims the public view it largely through the lens of its most famous sufferer, Professor Hawking. 

However, as he was very young when he was diagnosed, it progresses much more slowly than usual. Even allowing for this, Professor Hawking’s longevity is remarkable.

The impact the disease has had on Mr Isaac's family is laid bare in the documentary, to be broadcast on Wednesday

Mrs Isaac said: ‘People don’t understand at all. People might see a tiny touch of it but they are not there to witness it, it’s ghastly. It’s a disease people just don’t know about. They might know the name, they might know it through Stephen Hawking. 

'I’m not medical but even I know he’s the exception to the rule. People look at him and probably think people with motor neurone disease will live a very long time. His is an extremely exceptional case.’

The impact the disease has had on his family is laid bare in the documentary, to be broadcast on Wednesday. 

It follows Mr Isaac’s struggles from diagnosis in February 2010 to his decision to have a tracheotomy in August 2014, hoping it would allow him to live a further three years.

In the intimate footage, which lifts the lid on what it is really like to live with a motor neurone disease sufferer, Mrs Isaac talks candidly about the strain it has put on their family and relationship.

She said: ‘It’s incredibly hard. I don’t want to be a widow and I don’t want to lose him but how much more can you cope with?

‘I’m really shocked. I thought, when he became ill we’d almost become closer and closer but almost it’s the opposite and I can’t believe that’s happened. I’m shocked that it draws people apart rather than together.’

Speaking about the tracheostomy she added: ‘I was thinking the other day, if it was my decision, not that it ever would be. 

'It would be so hard to say no knowing that he wants it but really and truly, I think myself and the kids are just exhausted with the whole thing and he’s going to die, really, really sadly he’s going to die. 

'Be it tonight or tomorrow or in a month or two months or a year. It’s just dragging out the inevitable. So if I had to say, I would say don’t do it.’ 

Filming My Father: In Life and Death (Verve Productions/Channel 5) will be broadcast on March 11 at 7pm on Channel 5.
