Fifty Shades Of Grey writer EL James has competition for her erotic fiction throne... and Sylvia Day - sitting pretty at the top of Kindle's steamiest chart with her Crossfires novel Entwined With You - had better watch out.

Another woman has been churning out racy tales of sex and sadomasochism as fast as her hot little hand will allow, and her new one hit the top of the Amazon charts within two weeks of its release.

And thanks to the online success of With This Collar, the first of Manchester-born Sierra Cartwright's six-part Mastered series, the e-book is now being published in print by Total-E-Bound Publishing.

Sierra Cartwright's steamy novel, With This Collar, claims to be even racier than Fifty Shades Of Grey by British writer EL James

With This Collar tells the story of Julia Lyle, who finds herself 
unexpectedly thrown into the world of BDSM at her best friend's 
wedding.

As she begins to object during a 
ceremony in which her friend vows submission to her new husband, she is 
stopped by Marcus Cavendish, who offers to introduce her into the clandestine lifestyle.

Speaking to Handbag.com, Cartwright said: 'I had written nine books but then I went through a difficult divorce and I channelled all my creative energy in to writing murder mystery novels, but I ended up taking a break.

'I've always been interested in erotic fiction and then after my divorce I started dating again and met some gentlemen who were a little more risqué than my ex-husband.

'So I actually had a little bit of experience that was helpful, and it allowed me bring an added dynamic to the romances that I write.'

Cartwright said: 'I've always been interested in erotic fiction and then after my divorce I started dating again and met some gentlemen who were a little more risqué than my ex-husband'

Claire Siemaszkiewicz, CEO of Total-e-Bound, said: 'We watched the 50 Shades phenomenon with interest, we've seen the copy cats so we decided to get right under the skin of what women want when it comes to their "me time" reading material.

'Over the last 2 months we've surveyed 1800 women in the UK and US and we know that they're hungry for well-written, sexy stories about love, power and relationships.

'They want real-life romance that doesn't stop at the bedroom door. But above all they want great stories, believable characters and provocative storylines.'

With this Collar is available as an e-book for 79p and in print for £6.99 from Total-E-Bound publishing.

With This Collar is the first in the six-part Mastered series

'Would you like to offer your submission?' Ben asked.

Lana tipped back her head. 'Yes, Sir, I would.'

Damien picked up something from the mantel and offered it to Ben. Julia stood on her toes, trying to get a better look.

'To the vanilla world it looks like a silver necklace with a lock on it,' Marcus said. 'But those of us in the lifestyle recognise it for what it is. A collar.'

'Collar?' Julia repeated. The word startled her so much that she didn't think to ask what he meant by lifestyle.

'Some people use dog collars from the pet store,' he said.

'You can't be serious.'

'Deadly.'

She wrapped her arms around her middle. 'In this case, it appears to be an ordinary piece of jewellery, but it likely has a hex screw so that she can't remove it.'

Ben accepted the necklace from Damien and passed the chain through the flame of an enormous candle.

'He's purifying the metal,' Marcus explained. 'And then he'll ask her again if her submission is given of her own free will.'

Ben looked down at Lana and captured her chin before saying, 'I offer you this collar as a symbol of my love, and as a promise to be a kind, consistent and honourable Master. In return, I will demand your servitude. I will enforce the rules we have agreed to, and I will never touch you in anger.'

Lana linked her hands at the small of her back, while she continued to meet her new husband's gaze. Firmly she said, 'I accept your gift. In return, I offer my humble devotion and a promise of my servitude.'

To Julia, the words sounded just as practised as their traditional vows had.

'We're here in front of our friends and mentors, and I want everyone to hear your assurance that you are willingly agreeing to be my slave.'

The blood chilled in Julia's veins. As if Marcus sensed it, he tightened his grip on her. Oddly, the touch reassured and grounded her rather than annoyed her.

'I am joyfully agreeing to be your slave, Sir.'
