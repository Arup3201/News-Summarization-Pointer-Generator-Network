Billionaire philanthropist ill Gates is among the latest in a wave of celebrities to complete the ALS ice bucket challenge, in an attempt to raise awareness for the disease.

Unlike his famous peers, the tech-savvy Gates engineered his own structure to help with the icy stunt.

IIn a video posted to Gates' YouTube channel, Gates sees a clip in which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg nominates him before dumping an icy bucket on his own head.

Gates then looks at the camera, and says he wants to improve the ALS ice bucket challenge.

''I'm
 glad to give to ALS. It's a great cause, but I want to accept this 
challenge, but I want to do it better than it's been done,' he says.

An ice bucket challenge nominee is 
taped pouring water down onto his or her head, then posts the video 
online and nominates others to do the name, The Boston Globe explained. The challenge must be 
completed within 24 hours, and if not the nominee donates $100 to an ALS-based charity.
