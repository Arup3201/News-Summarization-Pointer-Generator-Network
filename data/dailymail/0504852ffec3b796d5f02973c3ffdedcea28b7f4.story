Sun hat: The pope seen in an official picture in 2010 in the gardens of his summer residence Castel Gandolfo

Dressed all in white and complete with a matching baseball cap, the Emeritus pope has been seen for the first time since he retired - and he looks like he is enjoying every minute.

The former Pope has been snapped wearing the baseball cap he usually wears only in the summer months.

The picture was published in the infamous glossy Italian weekly Chi, the same magazine that ran pictures of a topless Duchess of Cambridge on holiday in France.

Meanwhile Vatican officials 'gagged' cardinals gathered for the election of the next pope from speaking to the media amid reports the conclave has been delayed again.

American cardinals who had been scheduled to hold their third media briefing in as many days cancelled it less than an hour before it was to have started at Rome's North American College, where they are staying.

A spokeswoman for the American cardinals said 'concern' was expressed at Wednesday's closed-door meeting 'about leaks of confidential proceedings reported in Italian newspapers'.

As the meetings were delayed in Rome, the ex Pope Benedict XVI, 85, was pictured walking with the aid of a stick through the gardens of his summer residence at Castelgandolfo on the outskirts of Rome where he will be living until his new apartment - a renovated convent in the grounds of the Vatican are ready.

He is not wearing his trademark red shoes but dark ones and he appears to be deep in conversation.

A second photograph saw the former Pope being joined on his walk by a group of housekeepers.

The
 Vatican revealed last week he had enjoyed an evening of watching 
television before having a night of 'serene and peaceful' sleep.

The
 former First Leader of the Catholic Church will live at Castel Gandolfo
 for several weeks, sleeping in a bed just 75cm wide and without a 
canopy, unlike the one the much grander one slept in over his eight 
years as pope.

He will then move to a specially prepared apartment at a convent in the Vatican.

The retired pontiff has reportedly taken with him a number theology books as well as music to listen to.

He was also hoping to play the piano - one of his favourite pastimes - in the evenings.

More than 150 cardinals attended the third day of the preliminary meetings to sketch a profile for the next pope following the shock abdication of Pope Benedict last month.

All but two of the 115 'cardinal electors' aged under 80 have arrived for the meetings, the Vatican said.

The preliminary meetings are taking place as the crisis involving sexual abuse of children by priests and inappropriate behaviour among adult clerics continues to haunt the Church and has rarely been out of the headlines.

Under Church law the cardinals have until March 20 to start a conclave to choose a new pope to lead the 1.2 billion-member Church.

While many observers had expected the conclave to begin as early as this Sunday or Monday, there have been increasing indications that the cardinals want more time to ponder who among them might be best to lead a Church beset by crises.

Several of the prelates leaving the meetings said preliminary proceedings were still at the early stages and more time would be necessary before they could decide on when to start the conclave in the Sistine Chapel.

Workmen have begun preparing the chapel, building a new, suspended floor to protect the centuries-old tiles.

Nonetheless, the Vatican spokesman said it was important that no one felt "pressured" into going into the conclave before they were ready and that more time would be needed for "reflection".

One cardinal leaving the meeting said there had been no formal discussion on Wednesday of the so-called "Vatileaks" scandal, which led to the arrest of Paolo Gabriele, the pope's butler, further besmirching the Church's reputation.

Gabriele was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. The documents alleged corruption and infighting over the running of its bank.

A trio of elderly cardinals prepared a report on the scandal for Benedict, who later pardoned Gabriele, and a number of cardinals attending the preliminary meetings said they wanted to be briefed on the report.

Thousands gathered in St Peter's Square to hear Benedict's retirement speech last Thursday.

After the end of Benedict's papacy on
 Thursday, every department head in the Vatican vacated their job - 
except for those who are considered crucial for the smooth running of 
the transition period.

Before
 leaving, Benedict XVI said goodbye to the monsignors, nuns, Vatican 
staff and Swiss Guards who make up the papal household.

The 85-year-old’s Italian air force helicopter circled Rome, passing over the Colosseum to give him a last view of the city.

Bells rang out from St Peter’s Basilica and churches all over Rome as he flew overhead.

He also sent a final tweet, saying: ‘Thank you for your love and support.

'May you always experience the joy that comes from putting Christ at the centre of your lives.’

Yesterday
 the Vatican gave the clearest signal yet that it is preparing to elect a
 new Pontiff by closing off the Sistine Chapel to the public.

Michelangelo's frescoed masterpiece will be closed to tourists while preparations are made for the Conclave.

When
 the time comes it will be Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran's job as 
proto-deacon to announce 'Habemus Papam!' ('We have a pope!') from the 
balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square after the smoke has snaked up 
from the Sistine Chapel chimney.
