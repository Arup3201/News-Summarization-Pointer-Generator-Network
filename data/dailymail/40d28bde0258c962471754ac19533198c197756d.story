The owners of the Manhattan building used as Carrie Bradshaw's apartment for the filming of Sex and the City are outraged after Sarah Jessica Parker staged a photo shoot on their stoop without allegedly asking for permission. 

A constant stream of SATC fans have led the owners of the West Village building to install a metal chain across the steps that reads 'Do NOT go on staircase please'. 

While some  wannabe Carries have crossed the chain before to take personal pictures at the TV mecca, the homeowners were shocked SJP herself would violate their privacy.

Not okay: Sarah Jessica Parker allegedly held an unauthorized photo shoot on the stoop of her character Carrie Bradshaw's Sex and the City apartment 

What would Carrie do? A source told the New York Post that the owners of 66 Perry Street did not receive a request to hold the photo shoot from SJP (as Carrie Bradshaw on the left)

On October 7, the actress posted pictures to Instagram while shooting an advertising campaign for her Nordstrom shoe line. 

In one of the pictures, she leans over the metal fence to place colorful stilettos on the famous steps.  

'It was take your @sjpcollection shoes to work day. #longdayforCarrie #whewwwwthosesteps #runninginheels #taxi!' Parker wrote. 

The owners of 66 Perry Street did not immediately return MailOnline's calls for comment on Tuesday, but a source told the New York Post: 'The owners are up in arms as they deal with relentless tourists, and SJP has ignored their requests for an explanation on how she could endorse the shoot, even though "no trespassing" signs are posted.

'The owners are up in arms as they deal with relentless tourists, and SJP has ignored their requests for an explanation on how she could endorse the shoot, even though "no trespassing" signs are posted,' a source told the Post

'SJP used their house during the years of filming, and now won’t acknowledge that she and her company used the steps and facade, this time without permission, to promote her shoe line,' the source said. 

It's unclear how this recent breach would impact a rumored third Sex and the City movie in the works. Bradshaw's home might not factor since she was living with Mr Big at the end of the second film.

Gerald Banu, president of the Perry Street association, confirmed to the Post that the actress did not ask for permission to stage her shoot and that the Sex and the City hysteria has not died out - even the show finished filming more than 10 years ago.  

'The only thing I could suggest to SJP is that when they write the next script, please have Carrie move to a new address,' Mr Banu told the Post.

A representative for SJP did not return MailOnline's calls or email Tuesday morning.  

Trespassing: This Facebook user is just one of the many Sex and the City fans the owners of 66 Perry Street have to deal with crossing their fence and walking all the way up to their door for photo shoots 

Can't leave the neighborhood: SJP lives in a nearby apartment with husband Matthew Broderick, just a few blocks from Bradshaw's Perry St flat. Pictured outside the apartment in May 2014
