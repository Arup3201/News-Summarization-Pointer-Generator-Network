There's a little bit of a feeling that Fiji have become the forgotten team of our World Cup group, but we know the danger they pose if not taken seriously.

They have some really talented players based all over Europe. Their sevens background naturally breeds players who like to play an expansive and attractive style. Sevens is a quick game and it helps develop a lot of good centres, wingers and full backs. 

You only have to look at Semesa Rokoduguni and Tevita Kuridrani, who play for England and Australia, for two examples of the kind of talent produced in Fiji.

Saturday is a chance to lay down a World Cup marker. The All Blacks are obviously the No 1 team in the world and we play them the following week, but that won’t be in the back of anyone’s mind. Fiji are our focus; they are really strong and, if we’re not switched on, they can do some damage.

On a personal note, it will be nice for me to get back on the wing after my run at centre against Australia. I enjoyed the switch in position, even if it was cut short by the injury to Leigh Halfpenny. 

Our performance was very positive, but there has been a negative spin put on it because of the final score. While we didn’t get the victory, we did outscore Australia by four tries to three. Any other day that would be a win.

It was our first game on the new semi-artificial pitch. The surface was very quick compared to what we had previously, but the more we play on it, the easier it will become. I think it can give us a real advantage going forward — starting tomorrow. 

We’ve got James Hook back in the squad and it’s great to have him involved. He was left out initially but he’s already up to speed; that alone goes to show what a talented player he is.

Rhys Priestland was booed by a small part of the crowd on Saturday and that’s pretty appalling.

No player deserves that. He’s an outstanding talent and I don’t think people understand how rough he’s had it in terms of injuries and criticism on social media. It almost caused him to hang up his boots. 

I don’t think anyone should be driven to that position. It’s just not on. The team all support him. Everyone has ups and downs, but I think Rhys has shown in his last four or five games for the Scarlets that his form is coming back.

He just needs some time to find his feet. Warren Gatland told him to go out and show two fingers to his doubters and I agree with him. When he finds his form everyone will suddenly say, ‘Oh, he’s amazing, whey didn’t we pick him for the first Test?’ It’s just the Welsh public!

We're doing a lot of intensive training and that definitely helps you build up an appetite throughout the day.

Big John Williams, our nutritionist, puts on some lovely grub for us. It’s all very healthy stuff but I like to have the occasional sweet on the side. 

A lot of the big front-five guys can put their food away, but none more so than Rhodri Jones — he can eat like there’s no tomorrow! When he’s not hungry he will still eat and he’s face down most of the time without a knife and fork!

I’m trying to get in the spirit of Movember.

I’ve joined my Northampton team-mates in the Front Mo Union, so hopefully we can raise some money. I like to think I have a bit of a Ron Burgundy look, but really it’s more of a top-lip slug!

Warren Gatland told the media on Saturday that Gareth Anscombe, the Kiwi who has just joined Cardiff, needs to familiarise himself with the Welsh banter before he joins up with the squad.

My tip would be to come in with an open mind and not to spend too much time with Scott Williams and Bradley Davies, because they have shocking banter. He should sit down for a coffee with Mike Phillips; he is good craic and would definitely help him get to know the Welsh way!
