As new information continues to pour in about Wednesday's tragic shooting in Canada, gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's reasons for killing a solider and opening fire on Parliament still remain very much unclear.

A 2011 court statement from Zehaf-Bibeau could shed some light on the attacker's past - and perhaps his motivations - as it was revealed today he had recently applied for a passport and planned to travel to Syria after undergoing a 'radicalization process'.

Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo at a national war memorial in the capital Ottawa on Wednesday before racing through the parliament building where he was shot dead near where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with lawmakers.

It has emerged that, three years ago, he begged prosecutors to put him in jail to help him beat his drug addiction.

No proof: While may said Zehaf-Bibeau had terrorist ties following his shooting spree in Ottawa Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird currently says there is 'no evidence' of this

Zehaf-Bibeau walked into a Royal Mounted Canadian Police station on December 15, 2011, and asked to be put in jail for an armed robbery he committed ten years prior.

'I went to see the RCMP, I told them, 'just put me in so I could do my time for what I confessed,'' said Zehaf-Bibeau, in audio tapes obtained by CBC.

'They couldn't. So, I warned them, 'if you can't keep me in, I'm going to do something right now just to be put in.' So I went to do another robbery just so I could come to jail.'

That robbery happened just hours later, when he went into a McDonald's with nothing but a sharpened stick and demanded all the money in the cash register.

Police who arrested him on the scene said he seemed 'happy.' 

He then told the judge at his hearing, which happened after the incident at McDonald's but was for a likely parole violation stemming from a different robbery charge that occurred in Quebec and for which he had already served two years, 'I'm a crack addict and at the same time I'm a religious person, so I want to sacrifice freedom and good things for a year maybe, so when I come out, I'll appreciate the things of life more and be clean.'

He added, 'The reason I am here is because I wanted to come in. The police said they couldn't keep me, so I went to do a crime to come to jail. So if you release me what's going to happen again? Probably the same loop and I'm going to be right back here again.'

Oddly enough, the prosecutor said Zehaf-Bibeau had already served his time and should not be allowed to go to prison, but the judge agreed to put him away, initially just over the holidays, and he stayed there, it appears, until his hearing in February 2012 involving the incident at McDonald's.

At the time, Zehaf-Bibeau thanked the judge, and said, 'Perfect.' 

In the McDonald's case however, they could only charge Zehaf-Bibeau with uttering threats and, having already served 66 days in prison since December, he received just one additional day.

The judge said to him, 'Good luck sir.' 

It comes as police revealed he had recently applied for a passport, planning to travel to Syria after undergoing a 'radicalization process.'

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was a Canadian who may also have held Libyan citizenship, said Bob Paulson, commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). He said the suspect had no apparent links to another Canadian who killed a soldier in Quebec earlier in the week.

'We need to investigate and understand his radicalization process. He is an interesting individual in that he had a very well-developed criminality,' Paulson said. 'There is no one path or one formula to radicalization.' 

He had recently applied for a passport and had arrived in Ottawa on Oct. 2 to try to speed that process, but checks by the RCMP did not turn up any evidence of national security-related criminality despite criminal records indicating infractions related to drugs, violence and other criminal activities, Paulson said.

Meanwhile, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird has said there is 'no evidence' linking Zehaf-Bibeau to a wider group, or network, of jihadists.

What there is plenty of evidence of however, after multiple interviews with people who knew the 32-year-old shooter, is his struggle with drugs, and his desperate desire to kick his addictions. 

Abdel Kareem Abubakir, who became close with Muslim convert Zehaf-Bibeau as a result of their shared faith when they both lived at the same shelter, the Ottawa Mission, told the Globe and Mail, 'For two weeks he was communicative, but then when he collapsed into drugs, he became isolated.'

He added, 'His intention was to get passport and get home. He had to stay away from drugs.'

Zehaf-Bibeau, as it has been reported, was unable to get his passport to travel to the Middle East.

Another man, who wished to remain anonymous and lived with Zehaf-Bibeau at The Beacon, a shelter in Vancouver, British Columbia, said that he met him in 2012 as he was in detox 'fighting off an addiction to crack cocaine and heroin.'

He said Zehaf-Bibeau relied on 'constant prayer' to fight off addictions. 

Sneaking off: It was also revealed he was asked to leave his mosque, Masjid al Salaam (above), for sleeping there without permission, not extremist views

It has also been revealed that the young man was not asked to leave his mosque, Masjid al Salaam, in Barnaby, British Columbia, because he had any extremist views, but rather because he had begun sleeping there without permission. 

'At some point, when he got in trouble with the law, and he didn't have a place to go to, he started sleeping at the mosque without any authorization,' said Aasim Rashid, a member of the British Columbia Muslim Association.

'When the mosque administration found out it, they asked him to leave immediately and asked him never to do that again.'

The young man apparently stole the keys despite these instructions, and soon the locks were changed and he was told to never return.

Rashid said there were no signs of 'radicalized behavior,' and had there been, members of the mosque would have noticed immediately as they 'don't tolerate that kind of extremist mindset.' 

What this reasoning does not explain however, if true, is why the young man would choose to commit such a horrific act if all he desired was to be put in jail.

When they refused he said if they did not, he was going to do something 'just to get put in,' and hours later tried to rob a McDonald's

He then appeared in court a few days later, for a hearing on a previous robbery in Quebec, and begged the judge to put him away so he could 'overcome his crack addiction'

The prosecutor in the case said he should not go away, but he managed to spend 66 days in prison after pleading with the judge

This comes as Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird says there is currently 'no evidence' of any terrorist ties in the shooting
