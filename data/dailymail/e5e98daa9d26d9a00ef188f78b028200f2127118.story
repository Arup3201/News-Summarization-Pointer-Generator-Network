An army veteran has been told that he would not be allowed to stand for the National Anthem during a military concert because of health and safety rules.

Retired Royal Artillery gunner Doug Speller, 74, was informed by booking staff at a concert theatre that audience members had to be seated at all times during a performance by an RAF band.

When he questioned whether the rule would apply if the band played a traditional rendition of God Save the Queen, he was told not to stand at any time.

According to Mr Speller, organisers said the rule was a health and safety precaution which prevented people dancing dangerously in the stands.

The veteran of Thetford, Norfolk, paid £18 for balcony ticket at the Apex theatre in Bury St Edmunds  for a 'Path to Peace concert' by the RAF Honington Voluntary Band in November.

He booked to see the performance having served for six years as a Royal Artilleryman in Singapore and Germany before a further 18 years as a Territorial Army Sergent.

But after being told about the no standing rule, Mr Speller described the decision as 'silly'.

Time-served: Mr Spellar, pictured here in his days as a Royal Artillery Gunner, said he was outraged that he could not stand for the anthem, saying: 'It's what people fought for, so that we could be free'

He said: 'How dare they tell me I can't stand for the national anthem? The national anthem is what this country is all about.'

'It's what people fought for, so that we could be free.
As far as I am concerned we should be standing up to protect it, not 
banning people from respecting it because of silly regulations.

'It's a lovely theatre but if they want to survive they shouldn't be doing things like this. It's like so many things in this country, they want to stop this and stop that.

'You've got to wonder whether they'll try to do away with the national anthem all together. Health and safety is a good idea when it's done properly but things like this really beggar belief.'

Under review: The venue apologised for the 'misapplication of health and safety principles' and said it would review the way staff enforce the rule

St Edmundsbury Borough Council, which runs The Apex, said there had been a 'misapplication of health and safety principles'.

A council spokesman said the rules were there to stop audiences dancing dangerously and not to ban them from standing in respect.

He said: 'We will make sure that our staff understand how rules apply to this part of the building, for the various types of events held here.'
