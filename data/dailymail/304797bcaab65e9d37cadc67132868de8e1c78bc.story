Police in Spain are probing an alleged mega fraud involving millions of pounds of EU cash.

Regional governors, trade unions leaders and employers’ associations are being investigated over the suspected diversion of more than £1.5 billion meant for back-to-work training schemes.

Detectives in Andalucia, southern Spain, where the probe is focused, believe they may have uncovered the country’s biggest-ever fraud.

Most of the cash at the centre of the scandal comes from Europe and is therefore part paid by British taxpayers.

Andalucia, where nearly four out of every ten people are out of work, has raked in around 35 per cent of the cash aid Brussels has given Spain in recent years through European Social Fund employment training grants.

The poverty-stricken region received £2.3billion from the fund between 2007 and 2013 to help its jobless back into the employment market, according to local estimates.

Spain’s government contributed another £710 million.

Specialist police investigators suspect millions have ended up in the bank accounts of those involved in the alleged fraud.

The Andalucia region is still being rocked by an ongoing multi-million fraud scandal involving fake redundancies.

A regional government chauffeur investigated over the fraud has admitted to spending more than £20,000 a month of public money on cocaine-fuelled parties.

Police heading the new probe - dubbed Operation Edu - say they have detected irregularities in 15 of the 20 companies initially investigated in Malaga.

A source said: 'We think it’s just the tip of the iceberg.'

A firm with just two employees which doesn’t appear to have done any business at all for the past two years despite receiving more than £250,000 in training grants is among those being probed.

More than 250 people including dozens of allegedly fake students who never showed up for courses they had signed up for, have already been quizzed.

Opposition right-wing politicians in Andalucia are demanding explanations from the region’s left-wing PSOE party president Susana Diaz.

Juan Manuel Moreno, president of the opposition PP party in Andalucia, said: 'If these allegations turn out to be true we are facing a very serious situation.'
