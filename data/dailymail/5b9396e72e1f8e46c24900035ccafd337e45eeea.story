The second victim in the outrageous Missouri high school rape case has come forward, telling how she was sexually assaulted at the same time that her friend Daisy Coleman was being attacked in a nearby room by an older high school football player.

The girl, who has only identified herself as Paige, said that she was with her friend when they went over to meet up with a group of boys but they fought back when the boys started to attack them.

Paige, who was with Daisy on the night of
the January 2012 attack, spoke about the attack for the first time on 
CNN tonight with her mother, Daisy, and Daisy's mother all by her side.

'(Daisy) had texted Matt Barnett because 
Matt Barnett wanted to see her... so we snuck out and we got there and I
was immediately separated from her and taken into another room and 
sexually assaulted after I said no and pushed him away,' she told CNN's 
Erin Burnett.

Victim: Daisy Coleman (right) was found by her mother Melinda (left) after she was allegedly raped by a boy from her high school and he has not faced any charges

Breaking her silence: Paige (left) is Daisy's friend and was with her when she was attacked. Another boy also sexually assaulted Daisy and she remembers the horrible incident

Taking action: The girls and their mothers deny that they refused to cooperate, as the sheriff has said. That was the reason why he said that the boys involved were never charged

Paige did not name her 15-year-old attacker but said that unlike Daisy, she remembers all of the details of the attack.

'After he was done and we went out to the
living room we waited for Matt to come out with Daisy and he opened the
door and I saw Daisy and she was incoherent- couldn't talk, couldn't 
walk, couldn't do anything.'

Paige went on to talk to Al Jazeera America who posted an edited transcript of their interview on their website.

'They drug [sic] her out of his bedroom window, drug [sic] her to the car, and then they were going to drop us off, but they were freaking out, trying to think of how they were going to drop us off without any of her brothers waking up,' she told Al Jazeera.

Opening up: Paige, seen here with her mother, said that the ordeal was 'very scary'

'They took her and carried her to the back corner of her house and left her there. And they told me to go inside, that all she needed to do was to sober up, and that she would be okay, and they were gonna be there and watch her.

'It was very scary. I was really confused and didn’t understand what was fully going on. I was in shock and really worried about my friend. It was freezing out. I don’t know. There was just a lot of things going through my mind.'

Daisy Coleman became suicidal after she was allegedly raped at age 14, then tormented by cyber bullies, her mother says

Daisy
was 14 and Paige was 13 at the time of the attack and the boys have 
never been charged because the local sheriff in Maryville, Missouri 
claims Daisy would not testify.

Daisy
denies his claims, saying that she was never asked to testify or else 
she would in hopes of getting her attacker- Matt Barnett- behind bars.

The girls stories have been corroborated by the evidence- including an iPhone video of the attack that one of Barnett's friends took that night.

Now Daisy's mother Melinda is continuing to put pressure on the sheriff's department, saying justice was denied when Nodaway County's prosecutor dropped felony charges against the two 17-year-old boys involved in Daisy's alleged rape.

'How do you think we didn't want to cooperate?' Coleman asked. 'We went to get a rape kit done. I wrote a statement, and my daughter gave a statement to the police.'

Coleman said that no depositions were conducted before the felony charges were dropped. She said she was asked but refused to invoke the Fifth Amendment before a planned May 31, 2012, deposition.

Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice issued a statement saying there wasn't enough evidence to pursue the charges because the accusers had stopped cooperating and asserted their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, but now the state's Lt. Governor is getting involved.

Friends: Paige, seen at left with Daisy at right, said that she remembers the night of the attack because the boys made Daisy drink much more than she had to

Better times: Daisy has said that she started self harming and tried killing herself following the attack

On Tuesday night, Peter Kinder put out a statement calling for another investigation into the case.

'The appalling facts in the public record shock the conscience and cry out that responsible authorities must take another look. I call on Attorney General Koster and Prosecutor Rice to join me in asking that the Circuit Court convene a grand jury to review all the evidence, hear all witnesses, and issue a decision as to whether charges should ensue,' Kinder wrote.

In an interview, Sheriff Darren White backed up Rice's statement.

The case has drawn new attention since The Kansas City Star published the results Sunday of a seven-month investigation into the allegations.

The
Star's story described a town where many appeared to be closing ranks 
around the accused and suggesting the girls were somehow responsible for
the incident.

The charred remains still stand months later of the fire-damaged home of Melinda Coleman and her children at 27932 S. Scout Drive in Maryville, Missouri

In April, after the family had moved, the family's home in Maryville was damaged in a fire, though a cause has not been determined.

Robert Sundell, an attorney who represented the teen accused of assaulting Daisy Coleman, said in a written statement that while many may find his former client's behavior 'reprehensible,' the legal issue is whether a crime occurred. He said the investigation raised questions about whether the 14-year-old was 'incapacitated during the encounter.'

He also said the charges were dropped after the accusers' stories changed during depositions.Coleman says her 14-year-old daughter was given alcohol in January 2012 and raped by a 17-year-old acquaintance.

Accusations: Daisy, pictured left with her brother, told police that she became so drunk she couldn't remember anything at a party thrown by several older high school boys

Paige, Daisy's 13-year-old friend says
she was forced to have sex with a 15-year-old at the same house, while 
another 17-year-old allegedly recorded the incident on a cellphone.

The
daughter acknowledged she and the friend left her house to meet the 
boys but said they gave her alcohol and she doesn't remember much of 
what happened next.

The boys said the sex was consensual.

The two 17-year-old boys were charged as adults, but Rice dropped felony counts against them several months later.

A misdemeanor count against the teen accused of assaulting Daisy was dropped subsequently.

The prosecutor cited a lack of evidence and the Colemans' refusal to cooperate. The 15-year-old was charged in juvenile court.

The entrance of Maryville High School - High school freshman Daisy Coleman was subjected to constant bullying from classmates - and even parents - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported she had been raped in January 2012

Sheriff White said he never 
understood the Colemans' reasoning and that authorities weren't 
considering charges against the 14-year-old girl.

'They stonewalled the case all by themselves,' he said.

Now that the family is saying they will cooperate, he wasn't sure whether that would make a difference.

'They
wouldn't cooperate and then they said they would cooperate. And then 
they wouldn't cooperate. And then they went back and forth,' White said.

'I'm guessing, and 
this is just speculation, but I'm guessing that the prosecutor would be a
little gun shy to believe that they would be willing to cooperate at 
this time.'
