A protective Michigan mother has been jailed after stabbing a woman who was fighting one of her adult daughters.

Octavia Dickens, 57, from Detroit, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of a misdemeanor aggravated assault, and began serving a four-month jail sentence yesterday.

Dickens said that she was defending her daughter, who was bleeding during the altercation that took place last November outside the family home.

During the incident on November 3, Dickens said a group of people knocked on her door, and her two daughters, Shonta Thrash, 33, and the other daughter who has not yet been named, 20, opened it.

While she was upstairs watching a movie, Dickens heard a disturbance outside and looked out the window and noticed her daughters were on the ground, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Her daughters had previously been involved in an incident with the 19-year-old three hours before, who showed up at the house with her 17-year-old sister and friend, a court document said.

A group of people with the three girls were at the house watching the altercation.

'I had to go out there and get them off of my kids,' said Dickens.

She said she became involved because she was worried what would have happened if she had not stepped in.

The 19-year-old  said that she was on top of Dickens's daughter when she was stabbed with the knife once in both her hand and abdomen. She spent two days in hospital after undergoing surgery on her abdomen.

Her 17-year-old sister also said Dickens jabbed her with the knife but that it did not go through the skin. 

Both of Dickens's daughters were taken to hospital following the incident, with one daughter receiving six stitches for a cut near her left eye, and the other had a swollen face and said she could not hear from her left ear.

Thrash, who was present along with her sister at the sentencing, said she felt her mother was just ‘protecting them’. 

Dickens admitted during a hearing at Wayne County Circuit Court that she used a small paring knife to 'poke' a 19-year-old woman who was fighting her daughter. 

She accepted a plea deal yesterday and was dismissed of two felony counts including assault with a dangerous weapon and intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.

The mother requested to begin her jail sentence immediately at the Wayne County Jail so that she could be released sooner.

If the case had gone to trial, Dickens could have faced nearly 23 months in prison. 

36th District Judge Kenneth King said during the preliminary proceeding in November that the case 'disturbed' him.

He said that he was not justifying what Dickens did but that if he had been in her situation as a parent, watching her daughter be attacked by a group of people, that he cannot say he would have acted any differently.

No one else has been charged in the case, according to officials. 

Sentencing in the case is scheduled to start on February 24.
