The Blackpool Tower Ballroom is the seaside town's pride and joy. But it takes a lot of elbow grease to keep it sparkling.

Last year, the well-known landmark hosted The iconic Blackpool Tower’s 120th Anniversary celebrations and events such as the Carnival Ball, Gold Soul and Lancashire Tourism Awards – not to mention the ultimate ballroom dancing competition, Strictly Come Dancing.

So it's hardly surprising that it's in need of a painstaking cleaning and maintenance programme - an annual event which  takes two weeks to complete.

This huge task begins with a thorough refurbishment of the dance floor, which since the ballroom opened 118 years ago, has been graced by millions of fox-trotting feet and sees 650,000 visitors each year. 

A team of maintenance engineers strip back, sand and polish the 120ft parquet floor, consisting of 30,602 blocks of mahogany, oak and walnut. 

The ballroom’s 14 ornate Edwardian chandeliers are then lowered, and every shard of crystal is buffed. Each of the 1,120 lights must be individually inspected, to ensure their perfect working condition for the coming season.

General Manager, Kate Shane, explains: 'Of course it's a colossal undertaking, requiring huge skill, but it's maintenance work such as this that keeps the opulence and grandeur of The Blackpool Tower Ballroom alive.

'Because of the extra funds generated from the balconies fee of £2.95 per person we are now in a position to start Phase 1 work on the upholstery in The Blackpool Tower Ballroom.

'We're incredibly proud of our team, whose dedication and hard work make it possible to preserve this great British building. We can't wait to kick off the 2015 season at The Blackpool Tower Ballroom, now that it's been given a little tender love and care!'
