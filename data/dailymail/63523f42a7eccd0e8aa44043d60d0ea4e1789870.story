Lionel Messi admitted Argentina were suffering before Angel Di Maria settled their last 16 clash against Switzerland with his extra-time goal.

‘We suffered, suffered and suffered, all of us,’ said Messi. ‘We started to think it wasn’t going to happen. But at the end we had luck on our side and now we have to take advantage and move on.

‘Like everybody, I was very nervous because we couldn’t score. We knew if we made a single mistake we would have been going home. We didn’t want it to go to penalties. We wanted to finish it off.’

On his 
crucial pass for Di Maria’s goal in the 118th minute, Messi added: ‘When
 I first got the ball I thought about taking the chance and shooting. 
But then I saw Angel and made the pass so we were able to celebrate.

'You
 have to win the game with the smallest details. Big teams have gone 
that nobody expected to be gone and others that nobody thought would be 
here still are. There are no easy opponents in the World Cup.’

Messi also admitted he was not sure if he deserved a fourth straight man of the match award.

‘I
 don’t know whether I deserved it or not,’ he said. ‘But what’s 
important is that we went through. It was difficult but we knew it would
 be.’

Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld retired from football at the end of the game.

And he compared Di Maria’s last-gasp winner to his experience in the 1999 Champions League final when Manchester United scored two late goals to defeat his Bayern Munich side in Barcelona.

'This also happened in the Champions League final,' said Hitzfeld, referring to the goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the Nou Camp 15 years go.

'I had to go onto the pitch after to console the players after because they did something great for themselves, the team and entire country.'

Disappointment: It was the final game of Hitzfeld's glorious managerial career after his retirement

The defeat brought down the curtain on Hitzfeld’s long and successful management career.

The German, who bows out of the game with seven Bundesliga titles and two Champions League wins, said there was no way he would return to management.

'I will go on working for German TV, but my job as a coach has finished now,' said the 65-year-old, whose brother died on the eve of the match.

'I am proud of my career. I have been very fortunate to coach marvellous teams and it has been a great honour to work for Switzerland.

'I therefore am proud to say goodbye to the Switzerland team with a heart full of emotions.

'We can walk tall and leave the World Cup with our heads held high.'
