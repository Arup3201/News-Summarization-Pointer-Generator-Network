Victims of the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal could have been under-compensated by up to £1billion, it has been claimed.

Any affected customers would have had PPI on credit cards issued by Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, MBNA and Capital One, according to an investigation.

The estimated shortfall relates to fees and charges attached to the mis-sold policies which have been left out of compensation calculations.

Lloyds Banking Group said: 'When a customer lets us know that they may have incurred other costs because of their PPI policy, we will investigate and make an appropriate refund'

Because these sums involve adding interest, the final amount customers received was dramatically reduced, the BBC investigation said.

Independent financial consultant Cliff D’Arcy estimated that banks could have to pay  out ‘somewhere in the region of a billion pounds of extra compensation’.

His calculation was based on factors such as typical penalty charges on credit cards, how many credit card users had PPI, how many of those paid charges and what interest they had to pay.

Barclays acknowledged it has previously operated a month-by-month assessment of whether PPI premiums had triggered additional fees, which met the requirements of the regulations and was independently assured

MBNA said: 'We are confident that our redress is correct, we have considered our methodology carefully and in detail. Our confidence is reinforced through external independent reviews'

The investigation said that in February, one PPI victim called Mark Pascoe was paid £5,800 in compensation by MBNA.

However, the lender’s calculations did not include more than £600 in fees and charges Mr Pascoe had incurred since taking out his card in 1997.

According to the claims management company advising Mr Pascoe, had those fees been correctly included in the calculations, his compensation payout would have more than doubled to more than £13,000.

Experts advised customers concerned they might have been shortchanged to get in touch with their bank.

According to estimates by consumer group Which?, the total amount put aside by banks to compensate PPI victims has reached £22.4billion.

Such policies were frequently added to loans or credit cards without customers’ knowledge, or without them fully understanding what it was or whether they needed it in the first place.

Lloyds Banking Group said: ‘When a customer lets us know that they may have incurred other costs because of their PPI policy, we will investigate and make an appropriate refund.’

Barclays acknowledged it has previously operated a month-by-month assessment of whether PPI premiums had triggered additional fees, which met the requirements of the regulations and was independently assured.

Barclays told the BBC that it is now introducing an ‘enhanced’ method.

MBNA said: ‘We are confident that our redress is correct, we have considered our methodology carefully and in detail. Our confidence is reinforced through external independent reviews.’

Capital One said: ‘We aim to pay redress that puts the customer back in the position they would have been in if they had not had PPI.’
