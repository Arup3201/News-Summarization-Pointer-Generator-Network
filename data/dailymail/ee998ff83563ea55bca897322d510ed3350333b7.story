For many mothers-to-be and bashful husbands, they have been a ritual of pregnancy for decades and regarded as a source of invaluable skills.

But the digital age and pressure of time is consigning antenatal classes to online tutorials.

A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out but critics are disappointed that the classes are being 'abandoned'.

Parenting charity NCT said the move online will put parents at a disadvantage but York Hospital insists the virtual classes will allow expectant mothers to access important information.

A hospital is to become the first in the country to replace antenatal lessons 
with 'virtual classes' to be watched online. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to the decision

All of the same information will be available online with virtual classes filmed at the maternity suite at York Hospital showing its staff and labour rooms.

The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing, the early stages of labour, and explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief as well as breast feeding and what can be expected after birth.

Midwife Sue Jackson said the films will familiarise the majority of women who are not going to classes with the staff and facilities.

She said: 'It should open up the information available to women much more effectively than what we have at the moment. We have to make sure the service is appropriate and is being accessed appropriately.'

York Hospital said antenatal classes will still be held for teenage mothers and women giving birth to more than one baby.

The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing and the early stages of labour. They will also include an explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief, breast feeding and what can be expected after the birth

Women will continue to see a midwife who will answer any questions and give guidance. But the parenting charity NCT has said it is disappointed antenatal classes were being 'abandoned altogether'.

Belinda Phipps, chief executive, said: 'There is currently no evidence to show that online courses are as good as traditional antenatal courses.

'Replacing the courses with an online-only system could put parents at a disadvantage.

'Antenatal education is not just about the transfer of information, but also the support you get from the parents that you meet.'

York Hospital said other relevant information to mums will also be available on the site, including information about healthy eating and frequently asked questions.
