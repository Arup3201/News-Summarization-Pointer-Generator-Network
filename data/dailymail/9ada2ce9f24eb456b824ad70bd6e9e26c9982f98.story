Dunkin' Donuts is making a return to UK after 20 years

It promises to be battle that will delight those of a sweet-tooth persuasion.

Dunkin' Donuts is to square up to Krispy Kreme in what promises to be an epic clash of the fried dough treat.

The US chain is making a return to Britain 20 years after it first tried to break into the UK market.

The rise of coffee chains such as Costa 
and Coffee Republic in recent years has tempted the business to return 
to these shores for another try.

Dunkin' Donuts last attempt to break into the UK market ended in failure, and it pulled out in the mid-1990s.

It
has agreed deals with two franchise partners to launch 50 restaurants 
in London over the next five years, with talks ongoing over a possible 
further 100 branches across the UK.

Giorgio
Minardi, president of Dunkin' Brands International, said: 'We feel 
there is significant opportunity for Dunkin' Donuts in the UK, and we 
have had a tremendous response from potential franchisees interested in 
developing the brand across the country.'

Its
parent group, Dunkin' Brands, already runs ice cream chain 
Baskin-Robbins in the UK, which now has 100 locations across Britain, 
including free-standing restaurants as well as concession locations in 
other shops and cinemas.

Dunkin'
Donuts currently has more than 10,500 restaurants in 31 countries 
around the world, including more than 100 locations across Europe in 
Bulgaria, Germany, Russia and Spain.

Dunkin' Donuts is set to take on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts

Under
the leadership of regional general manager Jim Johnstone, its UK 
restaurants will offer coffees, teas, espresso-based drinks, frozen 
drinks, doughnuts, muffins, croissants and sandwiches, as well as a 
regional menu to cater to British tastes.

Store
openings will initially focus on north and east London through 
franchise partners Court Group, chaired by David Sheepshanks, and DDMG, 
which is a partnership of US and UK franchisees.

Mr Sheepshanks is the co-founder of Suffolk Foods and former chairman of Ipswich Town Football Club.
