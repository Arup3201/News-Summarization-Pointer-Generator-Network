This is the moment a husband found guilty of murdering his wife’s lover was caught on CCTV buying bin bags to wrap his victim’s blood soaked head.

Heteny Tarsoly, 38, armed himself with a 2ft 6in metal crowbar and waited for victim David Hunter, 54, to return home from a night shift before beating him more than 10 times round the head.

CCTV captured him on the night of the murder in Derby on January 9 buying black bin bags at a Tesco Express store in which he wrapped his victim’s head.

It was eight days after he discovered that his wife Timea and Mr Hunter had been having an affair.

Mrs Tarsoly arrived at 6.30am the next morning to celebrate her birthday with Mr Hunter, having told her husband she was going to work.

Instead she found his bloody lifeless body on the grass underneath his Kawasaki 600cc motorbike at his home and tried to give him first aid.

Tarsoly admitted manslaughter but was found guilty of murder with a majority verdict at Derby Crown Court yesterday.

Bus driver David Hunter’s injuries were so bad that police initially thought he had been shot. They found killer Tarsoly baking a cake at home for his wife’s birthday.

He repeatedly denied having anything to do with the murder before blood was found in his car and he broke down saying he had momentarily lost control.

Tarsoly said he knew about the affair and had gone to Mr Hunter’s home to talk to him about his fear of losing his children.

He admitted taking a crowbar with him, for protection, because he believed Mr Hunter to be ‘volatile and sometimes violent’.

He claimed he had lost control after Mr Hunter told him: ‘She’s now my baby and they are now my children.’

Mr Hunter met Mrs Tarsoly when she found a job as a bus driver for Arriva after her husband was injured working in a chicken factory.

Due to nerve damage he was left unable to work but despite the £25,000 compensation payment he received, within a year the couple were suffering money problems and it was necessary for Mrs Tarsoly to start earning.

After they became friends, Mr Hunter became a regular visitor to the house and had dinner with the couple. Mr Tarsoly even admitted he liked Mr Hunter.

He said: ‘Many times he was invited to our house for dinner or supper and after sometime he moved into the house for a month or so. And yes, I was happy (about this).’

But Mr Hunter and Mrs Tarsoly’s friendship developed into a love affair and in September last year she asked her husband for a divorce.

The day after his murder, she let herself into his house, only to be surprised to find he was not there, realising he had not even been to bed.

Police discovered Mr Tarsoly had worn an extra layer of clothing, which he had also wrapped in the bin bags bought from the Tesco Express in Stenson, near Derby, and then burnt on the family barbecue the following day, before dumping the ash in a litter bin.

Traces of Mr Hunter’s blood were also found on shoes discovered at Tarsoly’s address. He had cleaned the crowbar and put it back in its usual place in his garage.

'His untimely death means that the family have been deprived of a loving father, grandfather, brother, uncle and nephew'

Spokesman for David Hunter's family

A spokesman for Mr Hunter’s family said: ‘His untimely death means that the family have been deprived of a loving father, grandfather, brother, uncle and nephew.

‘Two families have been devastated because of the actions of this man.’

Detective Chief Inspector Phil Cox, of Derbyshire Police, said: ‘It was a savage attack - such were the extent of the injuries to Mr Hunter’s head, we initially questioned whether he had been shot.

‘The police and prosecution believed this was murder, in the fact that Heteny Tarsoly planned to kill David Hunter that night. I’m just pleased now the family feel they have got justice for David but this is just the beginning of the mourning process for them.

‘Tarsoly’s actions have destroyed not just David’s family but his own and they will have to live with the consequences for a long time.’
