The Department of Transport is said to be taking steps to try and make using Google Glass while driving illegal in the UK - a year before the head-mounted device is expected to officially launch.

Stuff magazine exclusively revealed that the government is concerned about how the device, which is worn on a person's head and shows images on an built-in display, will distract drivers.

It is said to be taking 'pre-emptive' steps to get legislation in place before the gadget arrives in the UK next year, by working with police to extend the scope of existing offences.

Google launched its Glass, pictured, device in 2012 and only select customers, known as Explorers, have been able to get their hands on the technology. Rumours suggest the glasses will go on general sale later this year

Apple recently added Eyes-Free technology to its latest iOS software.

Named iOS in the Car, Apple plans to integrate phones with iOS 7 into the dashboards of cars.

If a car is equipped with this technology, a user can connect their handset to the system and use their car's built-in display and controls.

The Siri Eyes-Free tool also lets users control this system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road.

Samsung added eye tracking to its Galaxy S3 handset with the Smart Stay feature that can tell when a user is looking at the display.

Its Samsung Galaxy S4 then continued this trend by adding Smart Pause, which pauses video when the user's eyes wander from the screen.

A spokesman from the DfT told Stuff: 'We are aware of the impending rollout of Google Glass and are in discussion with the Police to ensure that individuals do not use this technology while driving.'

Using a hand-held mobile phone while driving was banned in the UK in December 2003.

It is already an offence to make phone calls and send text messages while driving, but hands-free devices are allowed.

Under the plans being discussed by the Government, the ban could see drivers incurring a £60 fine as well as three points on their licence if they use Google Glass while driving.

This is the same penalty given to people who use a mobile phone while driving, and the ban is likely to equally come under the 1988 Road Traffic Act.

According to Stuff, if the plans are approved it would mean developers would not be allowed to make apps for the device that can be used in cars either.

A Google spokesperson told Stuff: 'We are
 thinking very carefully about how we design Glass because new 
technology always raises new issues.'

Commenting on the news, David Bizley, Technical Director at the RAC, said: 'Usually, common sense is the best benchmark for making a decision about whether technology can make driving safer and easier and it seems the Government has taken the right course by being cautious when it comes to the use of Google Glass.

'Existing technology already provides distraction enough.

'Ultimately, however, we must not forget the most common distractions in this modern age are talking to passengers, adjusting basic car controls and eating or drinking and this is unlikely to change for some time.'

The news also comes as Google begins extending the rollout of the gadgets to the friends and family of people already on its Glass Explorers program.

According to reports from technology site Marketing Land, Google has started emailing owners invitations with a form that lets them share Google Glass with a friend. 

The email states that anyone using the device must be at least 18 years old and be able to collect the device from San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York. 

Google's Glass Explorer programme was launched in February.

Applicants had to post a message on Google+ or Twitter with the hashtag '#ifihadglass' and, if successful, were given the option to buy Explorer Editions of the headwear for $1,500 (£990).

These editions can be connected to Wi-Fi or tethered to Android and iOS devices. 

The device is activated using the voice command 'OK Glass', or it can be activated by running a finger across the side of the glasses.
