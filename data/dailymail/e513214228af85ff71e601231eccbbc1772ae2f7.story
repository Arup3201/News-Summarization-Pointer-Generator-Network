Boxing legend Floyd 'Money' Mayweather Jnr is used to winning, in fact, he's never been beaten inside the ring. However, his biggest fight is happening outside of the hempen square, with calls for him to be banned from entering Australia next week because of his abusive past.

An on-line petition has been launched via change.org to stop him from visiting the country because it states 'he abused his ex-partner in front of his children and went to jail after abusing five different women'.

Mayweather, 37, was jailed in 2012 for an attack (two years earlier) on his ex-girlfriend and needs the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to rubber stamp his visa application before heading down under next week, where he's expected to be the star turn at two dinners in Melbourne and Sydney. 

His local promoter, Max Markson, remains confident the boxing millionaire will be allowed to fly in with his entourage of 30 people.

Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jnr. is led away in handcuffs at the Clark County Regional Justice Centre in Las Vegas to serve two months of a three-month jail term in June, 2012. Domestic violence prevention advocates say his criminal record should preclude him from visiting Australia

He's the money man. Floyd Mayweather Jnr. is a multi-millionaire whose triumphs are not restricted to boxing bouts with several well documented betting plunges on sporting events

'He is no danger or threat to Australian society and is bringing his 14-year-old daughter and her mother along,' Mr Markson said.

'He hasn't offended for almost 4 or 5 years and has become a bigger star in terms of boxing, in fact he's the highest paid sports star in the world.'

As precedents go, two years ago former heavyweight champion and convicted rapist Mike Tyson, also faced a backlash over his planned tour but was granted a visa in the end.

Mayweather served two of the three-month prison sentence he was handed for a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack on former lover Josie Harris, as two of their three children watched.

Wherever Floyd 'Money' Mayweather Jnr. travels, he does it in style. But he is still awaiting a visa to allow entry to Australia for a promotional tour

Mayweather is considered one of the most bankable sporting stars in the world, his bouts regularly ranking in multi-million dollar purses

The petition against his entry states: 'His assaults are sickening to read about. He's alleged to have slammed a car door on a woman, then repeatedly punched her in the backseat. And he still seems completely without regret.'

'Allowing a chronic perpetrator of violence like Floyd Mayweather to visit Australia sends a terrifying message – that vicious, repeat abuse isn't serious.'

Immigration Minister Dutton's office has been contacted for comment by Daily Mail Australia but there is still no word as to whether the visa will be approved.

But the promoter of some of his planned Australian events, Max Markson, says the boxer should be granted a visa because 'he passes the character test'.

'There are reasons for it (visa being considered) because of his criminal record but he has done his time for that,' he said.

'The reason I believe the minister will approve (the visa) is the economic, social and tourism.

'There is no pressure on him to sign off on the visa, I wrote to him yesterday a few other people have written to him. 

'It (the planned trip) will generate $1.5 million dollars and socially it will raise money for charity by helping the Reverend Bill Crews, founder of the Exodus foundation.'

Author Tasha Robinson-White, whose memoir 'Right Hand to the Champ', chronicled the twelve years she spent working for the boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

Mayweather, 37, is expected to hold a news conference in Australia, where his local promoter suggests he will announce his decision to take the Super Fight offer with Manny Pacquiao on May 2

Mr Markson also believes the publicity Mayweather will generate while in Australia, will be unparalleled in sporting terms.

'He is scheduled to hold a news conference, I think as to whether he will fight Manny Pacquiao - the last time he spoke publicly about the possible fight was in mid-December.'

The promoter insists the boxer will announce his acceptance of terms for the Super Fight while in Australia.

'Bob Arum has May 2nd booked, Manny is ready, all the terms are agreed - now only Floyd needs to say yes.

'This is the reason why Floyd wants to come here - look, he could have done it at Super Bowl time but he is bringing 31 people, paying a lot trainers to come along.

Since his release from jail Mayweather has continued to extend his unbeaten run, which now stands at 47 wins

Max Markson says Mayweather does not present a threat to Australian society and will be playing the tourist, including walking the Sydney Harbour Bridge

'From a business perspective and sport too, it's all that global branding, you open restaurants all over the world, you had Pacquiao in London and Mayweather announcing he's planning to go to Australia.

'It's the biggest fight in boxing history and Floyd will get 60 per cent of it and some people say it will be $1 billion.'

The promoter insists Mayweather, despite his 'Money' man moniker, will not make much out of the planned trip.

'It is costing him more than he's getting to come here, and from a tourism point of view it will go global.

'He will climb the Harbour Bridge, he has almost 20 million followers and will be posting all that vision around the world, I think it will be on a scale of the Oprah and Ellen visits.'

There are reports Mayweather will officially accept the challenge to fight Manny Pacquiao while in Australia at a media conference set down for the Crown Casino in Melbourne

Talking tough. Floyd Mayweather is watched closely by Manny Pacquiao when they bumped into each other at a Miami Heat basketball game

I'm free on May 2nd, what about you? This could have been the topic of conversation between boxing legends Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather when they met at a recent basketball match in the US. It's rumoured the latter will use an Australian media conference to announce his intention to take up the Super Fight offer

Fiona McCormack, the CEO of Domestic Violence Victoria, has also backed a ban on the boxer from entering the country.

'At a time when public concern around the epidemic of violence against women in Australia has never been higher - a decision to allow someone into the country with such a history of violence against women, and who publicly defends that behaviour, would send a powerful message that we can ignore or trivialise violence against women,' she said.

'Men who choose to use violence against women do so because they believe that they have an entitlement, or right, to behave that way.

'When we glorify their achievements, it reinforces the stance that it is okay to abuse and control women".

Victoria's premier, who has launched a Royal Commission into domestic violence, was also less than welcoming when asked about the boxer's impending visit.

'I certainly won't be attending,' Premier Daniel Andrews said.

'I think my views, and the view of my government, on family violence are well understood.'

But Mr Andrews agreed Mayweather's visa was a matter for the Commonwealth.

Mayweather made his pro debut in 1996 and has won world titles in five different divisions in the years since

The sporting world is holding its breath for the reported Super Fight between two of the biggest ever names in boxing - Pacquiao and Mayweather. But will it be officially announced at the Crown Casino in Melbourne?

'Mr Mayweather’s celebrity will give our charity and the work we do great exposure over the coming months which will assist us greatly to help even more people in Australia,' said the Reverend Bill Crews

Mayweather, whose earnings last year reportedly topped $US100 million, is currently the world's best pound-for-pound boxer, holding both the welterweight and super welterweight world titles.

He has accumulated a record of 47-0 with 26 KOs since making his professional debut in 1996.

But apart from the jail term, he has reportedly been involved in seven assaults on five women that resulted in arrest or a citation from police.

Mr Markson thought is adamant he's coming down under for the right reasons and should be welcomed.

'I've hosted Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and many many big names - they cost me a lot of money, a lot more than Floyd will cost me,' he added.

And he also appears to have Reverend Bill Crews in his corner.

'Mr Mayweather’s celebrity will give our charity and the work we do great exposure over the coming months which will assist us greatly to help even more people in Australia,' he said.

'The charitable funds raised during Mr Mayweather’s time in Australia will be used in the following manner: providing food and health and well-being programs for homeless, disabled, disadvantaged and needy people and children including Aboriginal.

'Our charity relies on the generous support of the general public and people like Mr Mayweather to provide a safety net to those that need it most.'
