A single dad in Colorado has easily become a strong contender for 'Father of the Year'. 

Greg Wickherst, of Pueblo, has primary custody of his daughter, Izzy, after splitting from the three-year-old's mother.

But as he adjusted to parenting a little girl by himself, there was one main obstacle - doing her hair.

However, as an admissions representative at the IntelliTec College, he decided to turn to the cosmetology department for help.

Father of the year: Greg Wickherst was worried about being able to style the hair of his three-year-old daughter, Izzy, and so took lessons at IntelliTec College in Pueblo, Colorado

After speaking with some students about his situation, Wickherst started spending his lunch breaks getting tutorials from a cosmetologist. 

'I spent a couple hours just working on a mannequin and she showed me how to do a bun, a french braid, all the different styles,' he told Buzzfeed News.

And Wickherst picked the rest up incredibly quickly.

'It blew my mind how easy it was to do a bun,' he said. 

'I thought it was something super special, like real intricate, especially the one where you don't finish pulling the ponytail.

'I thought, Oh my god, that's so pretty for something that's so simple..

'I don't think most guys know that it's that simple.' 

Effortless: After being tutored by a cosmetologist - a professional hair stylist - Wickherst became a natural

Voila: Wickherst said it 'blew his mind' how simple a ponytail was

Proud: The single father has now become a hit on Facebook, where he posts pictures of Izzy's hair styles

The result?

Wickherst has not only become quite the hair stylist, but his newfound craft has made him a sensation on Facebook, where he posts pictures of his work, some of which are his own creations.

Furthermore, doing Izzy's hair is the best part of his day.

'My favorite part of the day is when I wake her up and get her out of bed and she’s still sleepy, so she nuzzles her face into my neck,' he said.

'That love right there, feeling that love and that trust is the most rewarding part.'

Happy times: Izzy appears to have no problem sitting and waiting for her father to work his magic

Creative: Wickherst said he now likes experimenting with new ways of doing his daughter's hair
