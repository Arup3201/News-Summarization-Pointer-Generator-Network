A man imprisoned in New York for killing his son to collect on his life insurance is now charged with murdering his first wife in 1991 for the same reason.

The Post-Standard of Syracuse reports that Karl Karlsen was charged in Calaveras County, California, Friday with first-degree murder in the death of Christina Karlsen.

Karl Karlsen pleaded guilty in Seneca County in November to a charge of second-degree murder. He admits he allowed a truck to fall off a jack and onto his 23-year-old son, Levi, who was working underneath it in the town of Romulus in 2008.

Murder and insurance fraud: Karl Karlsen was found guilty of murdering his son Levi last year and now faces the same charge in the 1991 death of his first wife Christina

Untimely death: Christina Karlsen was 30 when she died in a house fire. Her husband managed to get out with their three kids but she could not escape the bathroom, where just days earlier he had boarded up a window 

Karlsen collected $700,000 in insurance after his son's death. He'd received $200,000 after the 1991 fire that killed Christina Karlsen, Levi's mother.

Before this latest charge, his daughter Erin Deroche said she has no doubts that he was also responsible for the death of her mother as well. 

During the house fire that killed Deroche and Levi Karlsen's mother Christina Karlsen, she was screaming to get the children out of the house.

Christina was trapped in the bathroom after spilled kerosene was ignited by a faulty electric light. Although Karl Karlsen is credited with getting Levi and their other two children out safely, Christina was unable to escape through the bathroom window because Karlsen had boarded it up from the outside days before, saying it was broken.

‘At the time, I was six years old. I didn't understand that my mother was behind that wall dying,’ Deroche said.

A week after the fire, Karlsen left California for upstate New York with his three children to be near his family.

In the days before his wife's death, Karlsen had taken out a $200,000 insurance policy on her life

As she got older, Deroche said she was able to process what happened and came to believe that her father didn't do enough to help save her mother.

‘You know, that's not how people are supposed to act when someone they love is trapped and literally burning in front of them,’ Deroche said.

It wasn't until Deroche and her brother Levi were 11 or 12 when she said they secretly discussed the possibility that their father wasn't being truthful regarding their mother's death.

‘Between the two of us...we knew, because he didn't try,’ Deroche said. ‘He didn't make an effort to save her. He just stood there,’ she told ABC News.

However, when she and Levi confronted their father, Deroche said, ‘his biggest concern was that he wondered what the community would think of his own children accusing him of murdering their mother.’

After she received the news that father-of-two Levi had died in an apparent accident, Deroche said she tried to put her suspicions of Karlsen's involvement in Levi's death at bay, but was relieved when she learned about the investigation into her father.

‘It was never a question for me,’ Deroche said. ‘It was a matter of fact.’

When Karlsen was jailed, Deroche said she went to visit her father and told him that she knew he was involved in her mother's and Levi's deaths.

‘He won't ever own up to Levi,’ Deroche said. ‘But he did tell me… "It's been over 20 years, and they still haven't got me yet. What makes you think they're going to get me now?"'

Karlsen will be put on trial in two weeks but a judge ruled that testimony about the California fire and Christina Karlsen's death is off limits.

While she said she isn't angry with her father, Deroche said she regrets not going to police sooner with her suspicions of her mother's death.

‘What if I had said something earlier?’ Deroche said. ‘Maybe he'd still be here for his girls.’

His attorney wasn't available to comment.

Karlsen was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and insurance fraud in 2012 after his second wife Cindy - fearing for her life - agreed to wear a wire while talking to him about his son's death. 

Levi Karlsen's death was initially ruled an accident, but Karlsen collected a $700,000 life insurance payout after the incident, raising suspicions.

A family member tipped off the police about the large insurance policy and opened an investigation into his death last year.

Authorities in California also opened an investigation into the 1991 California house-fire that killed Karlsen's wife and Deroche's mother Christina Karlsen.

Karlsen cashed in on a $200,000 life insurance policy soon after.

On the tapes, obtained by ABC's Nightline, the 52-year-old can be heard telling Cindy while they were in a restaurant that he had removed his truck's front tires and raised it on a single jack before Levi volunteered to do the repair.

'I didn't push the truck, I said,' Karlsen said after Cindy asked him for the truth in Levi's death. 'No, I said I had nothing to do - but I said I took advantage of the situation once it happened.'

Police arrested Karlsen soon after and interrogated him for ten hours, in which he denied killing his son 75 times.

In the police interrogation tapes, also obtained by ABC News, he said: 'I found him dead. I f***ing panicked. I don't know. I don't know. I left him.'

Finally he told police he had been there when the truck fell on his son and caused it to fall.

'I opened the truck door because I had to get inside to move the linkage for the truck, and when I did, it tipped, and it just, whoosh, f***ing fell over,' Karlsen said.

He maintains it was an accident, but did admit that he left his son to die.

'He did admit that he caused the truck to fall on his son. He did admit that he left his son on the floor dying, but he never admitted that it was a planned, deliberate act,' said Seneca County Lieutenant Investigator John Cleere.

'The officers at the scene didn't see anything out of the ordinary,' he told ABC. 'They saw what appeared to be two grieving parents and what appeared to be an accident.'

Knowing about the insurance payout on his son, Cindy Karlsen grew suspicious when she found out her husband took out a $1.2million policy on her.  

That's what prompted her to work with police, leading to second-degree murder and insurance fraud charges against Karl Karlsen in the death of his 23-year-old son, Levi Karlsen.
