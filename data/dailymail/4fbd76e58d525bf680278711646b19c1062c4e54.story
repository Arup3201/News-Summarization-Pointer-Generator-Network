France international Remy Cabella is set to complete his move to Newcastle United.

The 24-year-old midfielder – who was at the World Cup but did not feature - will join the Magpies in a £12million deal this weekend.

Montpellier manager Rolland Courbis confirmed: ‘It is 90% there, not yet 100%. It is not yet complete, but certainly on the way to getting there. Talks are ongoing, especially regarding bonus payments.

‘I am not worried about it. Laurent and Louis (Nicollin, the club owners) were right to reject their initial, vexing offer which was ridiculous.’

Cabella will become Alan Pardew’s fourth signing of the summer following the arrival of Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback, Tenerife striker Ayoze Perez and Ajax playmaker Siem de Jong.
