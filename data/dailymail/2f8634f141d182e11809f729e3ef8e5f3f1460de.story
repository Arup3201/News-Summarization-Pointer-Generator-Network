Britain is to become the second country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes.

Laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging bearing only grisly health warnings will come into force next year, ministers said last night.

Public health minister Jane Ellison told MPs they would have a free vote on the issue – expected to be approved by an overwhelming majority.

The Government has been considering banning branding on packs for more than two years, following the example of Australia, the first country to introduce such laws.

Britain is to become the second country in the world to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes, it has been announced. Laws forcing tobacco firms to sell products in standard packaging - bearing only grisly health warnings - will come into force next year

Right-wing Tory MPs have complained that it would be a ‘nanny state’ measure, while others insist the reform will lead to increased smuggling and job losses.

Dozens are expected to vote against the measure, but it will pass through the Commons with the support of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs.

Medics insist that non-smokers – and younger people in particular – are likely to find plain packaging less appealing.

Announcing the Government’s intention to hold a vote in the Commons before May’s General Election, Miss Ellison told MPs: ‘Smoking remains one of our most significant public health challenges.

‘Almost 80,000 people in England alone die every year from ill-health related to smoking. Most smokers start young and we want our children to grow up free from the burden of disease that tobacco brings.

‘Having considered all the evidence, I believe that the policy is a proportionate and justified response to the considerable public health harm from smoking tobacco.

‘The chief medical officer has confirmed this view.

'I now propose that we lay regulations for standardised packaging in this Parliament to allow for them to come into force… in May 2016.’

Professor Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said: ‘I welcome the Government’s backing for this policy.

‘I have reviewed the evidence, and agree that standardised packaging would be a positive move for public health, particularly the role it could play in helping to prevent the uptake of smoking by children.

‘We need to keep up our efforts on tobacco control and standardised packaging is an important part of that.’

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity ASH, said: ‘Every day hundreds of children start to smoke. 

'Standard packs mean that the tobacco industry cannot use glitzy packaging to help addict the next generation. Standard packs are backed by the public… and health professionals.’

But Conservative MP Angela Watkinson said she would oppose the reform: ‘This policy is well-intentioned, but misguided.

'I believe it will do more harm than good.’

Christopher Snowdon, director of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘This is a gross infringement of the right of companies to use their trademarks and design their packaging.

‘There is no need to wonder what will happen next, we need only look at Australia – where the black market has grown and youth smoking has risen. 

'To pursue this grandstanding policy in spite of the Australian experience is sheer negligence.’

Conservative MP Philip Davies said: ‘I’m afraid this is an idiotic decision which is a triumph for the nanny state. 

'It is also completely pointless, given that cigarettes are behind the counter so you can’t now see the packets anyway. 

Public Health Minister Jane Ellison also revealed a ban on smoking in private cars will come into force from October (file picture)

'There will be a fair rebellion from my colleagues, which I would have thought the party could well do without just before an election.’

The issue of plain packaging has become a millstone for the Government, which has been accused of dragging its feet on the issue due to the influence of tobacco lobbyists, including chief Tory election strategist Lynton Crosby.

Downing Street insists David Cameron has not been lobbied by Mr Crosby on the issue, whose lobbying company represents alcohol and tobacco firms in Australia but has not disclosed its UK clients.

Cigarettes already have to be stored behind a screen in supermarkets, and similar rules will soon apply to small shops.

MPs recently voted to make smoking in cars while children are present illegal.

In December 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to insist all tobacco products are sold in standardised packs.
