Police were today hunting two eight year-old muggers who ripped an 80-year-old woman's bag from her hand as she walked down the road.

The elderly victim told police she had just got off a bus in the Sinfin area of Derby when the young thieves struck.

She said the two boys were no older than eight or nine years old and were only around 4ft 6in tall.

Police were today hunting two eight year-old muggers who ripped an 80-year-old woman's bag from her hand just after she got off a bus on this road in the Sinfin area of Derby

Both were wearing hooded tops with the hoods worn up and ran off down a nearby street with her handbag, which contained her purse, keys, bank cards and a Samsung mobile phone.

'She felt someone pull at her handbag,' a police spokesman said. 'She let go and turned around to see two boys running off with her handbag.'

Neighbours living near to where the woman was attacked said a similar incident happened around 18 months ago when teenagers mugged a pensioner in the same area.

Mick Smith, 59, said: 'This is absolutely despicable and a cowardly act. There have been anti-social behaviour problems in the past before but that's not involved children, it's been teenagers.

'I find it disgusting that people at that age can do this. It's always bad enough when people are mugged, but being eight or nine is unbelievable.

'At that age what are they going to achieve by doing this? It's not like they are on drugs.'

Under the law, children under ten cannot be charged with committing a criminal offence, but they can be given a curfew, or subjected to a  child safety order (file photo)

Pensioner Glynne Jones, 73, said he felt sorry for the elderly victim.

'It's hard to take in,' he said. 'Being that age and to do something like that is awful. It's very surprising and terrible.

'It's a nice area here and people do look out for each other and keep tabs on what is happening.

'I can't believe they are walking around unsupervised at their age, that's also what worries me.'

Lorry driver Pete Lambert, 47, added: 'It's normally quiet here 99 per cent  of the time. But this is horrific. At that age it isn't right, it's terrible.

'They should be doing normal things that normal children do at that age. I would love to see them caught as soon as possible and held to justice. You always get the odd incident but not when they are this age.'

Under the law, children under ten cannot be charged with committing a criminal offence. 

However, they can be given a local child curfew, banning them from being in a public place between 6pm and 6am - unless with an adult, or a child safety order where they are placed under the supervision of a youth offending team.

Under tens who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care, or their parents could be held responsible.  

People also took to social media to express their disbelief at the crime. Karen O'Donnell said: 'It's disgusting. Maybe if parents were allowed to chastise their kids, this kind of thing wouldn't happen so often.

'Mine wouldn't because they've been brought up properly. I hope the lady is all right and not too traumatised.'

Daniel Vasile said: 'Obviously the parents have failed in their mission to educate their children. Further inquiries need to be made. Those children need attention and care.'
