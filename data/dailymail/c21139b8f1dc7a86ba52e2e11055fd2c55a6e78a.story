A man suspected of having Ebola who was rushed to hospital in Melbourne has reportedly been given the all clear.

The patient was transported by Victoria Ambulance staff in full hazmat suits to Royal Melbourne Hospital on Thursday morning.

It’s believed the man recently visited West Africa, Nine News reports. 

However, Royal Melbourne Hospital said the patient does not have Ebola after the man was picked up in Port Melbourne with reported symptoms. 

He has not tested positive for the virus.

Paul Holman from Ambulance Victoria said: 'Paramedics were called to treat a man who was suffering from an infection in Docklands this morning. 

'The middle aged man was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital in a stable condition. Paramedics took standard precautions used for infectious diseases, and used personal protection equipment.

'The man is not being treated as a suspected Ebola case.' 

This week Australia became the first Western country to ban visitors from Ebola-hit areas of Africa, amid warnings the restrictions could make it harder to fight the deadly disease.

The government said it would refuse entry to anyone travelling from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leona - the countries most severely hit by the epidemic - despite there being no known cases of the virus in Australia.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament the government's processes were 'working to protect Australians'.

Australia will not issue new visas and will cancel temporary ones. Those with permanent Australian visas yet to arrive in the country will only be allowed to fly after a 21-day quarantine before their departure.
