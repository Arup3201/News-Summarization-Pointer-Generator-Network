A stunned Heather Watson was at a loss to explain her crushing first round US Open defeat after a summer which had promised a decent run at the year's final Grand Slam.

As it was the 22-year-old Channel Islander lasted just 54 minutes of the morning session before going down 6-1 6-1 to world number 81 Sorana Cirstea of Romania, who she had beaten three times before.

Watson served eight double faults and won only three points on her second serve as she heavily punished by Cirstea, who played way above expectations after winning just one match since Wimbledon.

Bowing out: Heather Watson was beaten in round one of the US Open by world No 81 Sorana Cirstea

Far from her best: British No 1 Watson recorded eight double faults as she lost in just 54 minutes 

Breezing through: Cirstea played more like her former world No 21 ranking than her current 81st position

The British number one has risen back to 45 in the rankings following a difficult 2013, benefitting from the more attacking style she has adopted with coach Diego Veronelli. Earlier this month she beat Australian Open runner-up Dominika Cibulkova, but that kind of form was completely absent.

'I didn't expect to play like this,' said Watson, who at one point shouted out 'It can't get much worse!' as she lost eleven of the last twelve games.

'She hasn't been in good form and I've been having a good run and playing well in practice. I've got to try and make sure this doesn't affect me going forward.'

Despite winning the junior title in 2009 Watson has yet to win a senior match at Flushing Meadows after four attempts.

The only consolation is that Watson has no ranking points to defend from last year for the rest of this season, and she will shortly embark on a series of four tournaments in Asia starting in Korea.
