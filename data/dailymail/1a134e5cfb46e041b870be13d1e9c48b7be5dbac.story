The United States has apologized to a man who was wrongly arrested, questioned and humiliated over the 9/11 attacks in a saga that cost him his family and his livelihood,

Kansas-born Abdullah al-Kidd, now 41, was arrested at a ticket counter at Washington's Dulles International Airport as he prepared to board a flight to Saudi Arabia in March 2003 - just 18 months after the September 11 attacks.

The University of Idaho graduate had been on his way to study Arabic and Islamic Law in the Middle East.

Detained, the former college running back was strip-searched repeatedly, left naked in a jail cell and showered for more than 90 minutes  in view of other men and women.

'Ruined my life': Kansas-born Abdullah al-Kidd, now 41, lost his job and his marriage broke down after he was arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport as he  boarded a flight to Saudi Arabia in March 2003

He  was also routinely transported in handcuffs and leg irons - which a federal marshall refused to remove so he could use the bathroom - and kept with people who had been convicted of violent crimes.

After 16 days he was released without charge - but was then forced to surrender his passport, limit his travel to four states, allow law enforcement to search his home regularly, and report to probation officers in Nevada and Idaho once a month.

Twelve years later, following years of court proceedings, he has been awarded $415,000 and an apology. 

Wendy J Olson, Idaho's state attorney, wrote to Mr Al-Kidd on January 15 with the statement: 'The government acknowledges that your arrest and detention as a witness was a difficult experience for you and regrets any hardship or disruption to your life that may have resulted from your arrest and detention.'

But Mr Al-Kidd says the damage is irreparable: his marriage broke down and he lost his job at Nellis Air Force Base, forcing him into cab driving. 

'It put a lot of stress between us,' Mr Al-Kidd said of his marriage in an interview with the LA Times. 'A lot of constraints on us. It led eventually to our demise. 

In court: The case questioned whether former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft was personally liable

'Once a month they came in and searched the home. It was just a really toxic environment.'  

One of the four planes hijacked in 2001 took off from Dulles, where Mr Al-Kidd was detained.

He was one of about 70 men, almost all Muslims, who were arrested and held in the months and years after September 11 under a federal law intended to compel reluctant witnesses to testify to grand juries and at criminal trials.

Mr Al-Kidd was wearing his Muslim clothing and long dark beard at the time, and said he could imagine what people were thinking as he was handcuffed and marched through the airport. 

'I could only assume that they thought I was a terrorist,' he told a court in 2011, describing it as 'one of the most, if not the most, humiliating experiences of my life'.

In a Supreme Court case tabled in 2011 that changed the U.S. law on detaining witnesses, Mr Al-Kidd accused the United States of violating the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.

The case questioned whether former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft was personally liable. 

Mr Ashcroft and other high-ranking officials publicly described the importance of using the material witness law against suspected terrorists, including U.S. citizens.
