BBC News better serves ‘rich, old, white people’ than those from poor backgrounds, according to the corporation's director of news James Harding

BBC News better serves ‘rich, old, white people’ than those from poorer backgrounds and ethnic minorities, its most senior executive has claimed.

James Harding, director of news, said the corporation must ‘redress the balance’ and cater for all licence fee payers equally.

Mr Harding based his claims on research by both the corporation and the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom which says that BBC News, along with other major news broadcasters, fails to attract young, poor, non-white audiences. 

In a speech yesterday, Mr Harding said: ‘There is a real issue of information inequality in this country. Rich, old, white people are getting a better diet of news than poorer, younger, non-white people.’

His comments echo those made by former director-general Greg Dyke, who in 2001 said the BBC was ‘hideously white’ and had worse race relations than some police forces.

However, Mr Harding came under criticism from politicians for declaring that certain audiences have a ‘better diet’ of news than others.

Tory MP Angie Bray, a member of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, called his views ‘patronising’. 

She said: ‘I think he needs to define his terms, what does he mean by better? People get the news they are interested in and that’s why you get such a wide range of newspapers. It’s all different but I’m not going to put a value judgment on it.

‘It doesn’t say much for the BBC, with all its claims that it has by far the widest audience of all. It sounds a bit patronising but I don’t really see what his point is. People take their news from where they get the news they want in the way that they want it.’ 

Mr Harding, who earns £340,000 for his role at the BBC, levelled the criticism at his own organisation during a speech on the future of BBC News and the corporation’s restructuring in the digital age.

Conor Burns, a Conservative MP and also a member of the culture select committee, said the BBC struggles to represent audiences from poorer backgrounds because it is dominated by wealthy men.

He said: ‘I suppose as a BBC executive, [Mr Harding] would be a bit of an expert on older, white males, who permeate and dominate the senior echelons of the BBC. My problem sometimes with the BBC when they talk about diversity is that they talk about diversity through a rather metropolitan, elite prism.

‘They think they will make their organisation more diverse if they can get some black privately educated men as well as some white privately educated men.

‘[These comments] seem to be an all-encompassing caricature of the problem. I think it’s a challenge for all broadcasters but I think the BBC has a particular responsibility because it is funded by the licence fee.’

In his speech, Mr Harding said the BBC is working hard to improve diversity both on and off screen. He said: ‘We are also going to keep on when it comes to diversity, disability and equality in the BBC: We have made real progress in the past year, on screen and off it but, to my mind, it’s not enough. We’re going to have to go further, faster.

‘We need to make sure we’re alive to the interests and concerns of all our audiences. We have to broaden the tone of what we do.’

A spokesman for BBC News said: ‘Internal BBC audience research suggests that BBC news typically reaches more people from higher social grades each week than people from lower social grades and that we also reach fewer younger people and fewer people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. That isn’t patronising, it’s simply a fact – and one that we continually strive to address.’

Former BBC Director General John Birt said the BBC was not tackling 'difficult questions'

The BBC is failing to address the ‘awesomely difficult questions’ facing modern Britain such as the threat of radical Islam, its former chief said yesterday.

John Birt, who was director general from 1992 to 2000, praised the BBC’s day-to-day news operation but said it ‘faces a challenge’ on its current affairs shows which are supposed to give a more considered take on events.

Lord Birt, who oversaw a radical modernisation programme during his time in charge at the BBC, said digital journalism had given people access to more information than ever before.

 However, he warned: ‘What it is not creating is more quality journalism. We get more knowledge of things happening around the world but pulling it all together and addressing the big policy questions – what should we be doing in respect of radical Islam, the National Health Service – that’s what we’re not doing very well and nobody’s doing very much.’

He added that the BBC must ‘get back to those very high purposes which are appropriate to a publicly funded broadcaster’.
