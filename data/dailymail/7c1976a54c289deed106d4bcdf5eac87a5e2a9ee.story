Southampton's players had a first chance to impress Ronald Koeman when they reported back for pre-season training on Wednesday - but Dani Osvaldo failed to show for the first day under their new boss.

The Dutchman cast his eye over his squad after taking over from Mauricio Pochettino in the summer.

A handful of the players also took part in testing at Southampton Solent University, but Osvaldo was absent from the group citing medical reasons.

James Ward-Prowse, Jack Cork, José Fonte, Steven Davis and Paulo Gazzaniga were put through their paces and were clearly feeling the strain if these pictures are anything to go by.

'It was difficult,' Ward-Prowse told the club's website.

'Obviously VO2 max means you run to your maximum and you can’t run anymore, so it’s difficult. It stands us in good stead to go and tackle the rest of pre-season and the season beyond.

'In midfield you’ve got to be able to do a bit of both. You’ve got to get in the box to score goals and get back to defend. It’s a very physical, demanding position but that’s why I enjoy it.'

Jack Cork added: 'It was hard. We do it nearly every season and I thought with the new gaffer coming in we might dodge it this year and get away with not having to do it!

'It’s one thing that keeps me motivated in pre-season to try and do some work because I know the first thing I’m going to do is have something like that to test me straight away. It’s hard but it helps us with all the data.

'I think it’s more just to test what level we’re at. Everyone seems to do alright. Everyone seems to finish on the same level.

'You get some a little bit higher and some a little bit lower. It tests our heart rates to see how we can work through the season.'

However, Osvaldo did himself no favours. The Italian, who is a target for Valencia and Inter, managed just three goals in nine starts for the Saints since his £15million move from Roma last summer and failed to impress out on loan at Juventus.
