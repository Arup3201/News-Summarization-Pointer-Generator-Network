It was a fitting tribute to a Games that has seen Britain claim its  biggest gold medal haul for more than a century.

Just two days after helping to take home the nation’s first-ever dressage medal of any colour, Charlotte Dujardin also became Britain’s first individual Olympic champion in the discipline.

And she did it all to the patriotic strains  of Land of Hope and Glory, I Vow to  Thee, My Country – and even the theme tune to The Great Escape and the chimes  of Big Ben.

The 26-year-old former stable hand, 
who left school at 16 to pursue her dreams of equestrian success, wept 
as her near- perfect score of 90.089 per cent flashed up on the 
spectators’ screens yesterday.

Amid joyous scenes at Greenwich Park, 
South London, the 23,000-strong crowd roared as the new golden girl of 
dressage, which tests the understanding between horse and rider as they 
complete a series of manoeuvres, collected her medal.

Kissing her horse Valegro on the nose,
she revealed: ‘This is what dreams are made of and there are no words 
to describe it.  I am so proud. This is unbelievable.’

Fellow Briton Laura Bechtolsheimer,  
27, the granddaughter of a German billionaire, also brought home the 
bronze after performing to a medley of Lion King tracks including I Just
Can’t Wait To Be King.

It means Britain’s riders have won 
three gold medals in three days, including one for showjumping and 
another for the dressage team event, in which the two women took part 
alongside Carl Hester.

Miss Dujardin’s success is all the more 
remarkable given her humble background, which sets her apart from the 
wealth of the horsey set, and the fact she only began competing at this 
level 18 months ago.

Brought up in Enfield, north-west London, she first became interested in horses after riding her mother’s Shetland ponies.

The emotion gets a little too much for Dujardin after she collects her gold medal

Dujardin received a massive score from the judges and ran straight to her mum Jane to celebrate

She was only able to buy her first grand prix horse after inheriting some money following the death of her grandmother.

Her parents Jane and Ian own a horse  
rug washing business called Mucky Rugs Wash Company at their home in 
Finmere, Buckinghamshire.

She recalls of the £18,000 horse 
called Fernandes: ‘My parents don’t have a lot of money and it was only 
through my mum’s mum dying, and with her inheritance money we managed to
buy Fernandes at a sale.

‘I started in a showing background. I 
was very lucky we had ponies. We had to produce ponies, make them into 
something, because we never had the money for top ponies.

‘Mum was very good at spotting a cheap one that was also a good one, I learned from that, so Mum taught me a lot.’

She later sold the horse to raise the 
funds to buy a house with her fiancé Dean Golding, a decision she said 
was the  ‘hardest thing – saying goodbye to my best friend in the whole 
world’.

Miss Dujardin has won her two Olympic 
gold medals on Valegro, which is owned by Hester, one of the country’s 
top trainers. She asked if she could have ten days’ work experience in 
his yard in Newent, Gloucester – and never left.

Hester allowed her to ride Valegro as 
a  novice because she was unable to buy her own pedigree and the pair 
did so well together that he decided to let her keep him – sparking a 
golden partnership.

Some commentators have spoken of the ‘telepathic’ relationship both horse and rider seem to share.

Miss Dujardin’s sister Emma Jayne, 29, yesterday said the family were  hoping to be able to raise enough money to buy Valegro.

She added: ‘She always said that at her first Olympics she would win gold and she did. It hasn’t sunk in she’s really done it.

‘It’s very emotional for her because 
it could be the last ride on Valegro. We want to win the lottery and buy
him for her. She is a very, very special sister  and we are incredibly 
proud of her.’

Miss Dujardin also admitted to being 
‘naughty’ as a teenager. She dropped out of her comprehensive school in 
Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, at 16 after telling her parents that 
‘school’s not going to teach me to ride any better’.

Yesterday, she told reporters she ‘didn’t really attend school as you can probably tell’.

Hester has also spoken of how he had 
spotted her talent ‘straight away’ and offered to give her a job as a 
stable girl. Sadly, the 45-year-old missed out on his own medal 
yesterday when he came fifth on another of his horses, Uthopia.

Last night, he said he was ‘very proud’ of Miss Dujardin, adding: ‘I always said Charlotte was the gold medallist.

‘Valegro is the best horse in the world, just the consummate professional.’

Miss Dujardin, who lives  with her 
partner and their boxer dog Winnie in a cottage on Hester’s estate in 
Newent, Gloucester, said that the horse ‘means the world to me’.

Yesterday, Miss Bechtolsheimer also burst into tears at the end of  her routine.

She said her performance was  
‘definitely the best ride I have had’ and that her mount, Mistral 
Hojris, whom she calls Alf, had been ‘just on the button’. The wealthy 
heiress said it was ‘the first music Alf had really seemed to enjoy 
dancing to’, adding: ‘He’s 17 years old and he has given me so much. He 
was so beautiful to ride.

‘It’s not a tennis racket, it’s a living animal, and when they fight for you like that it’s very emotional.’

These are the only podium places  
Britain has ever won in the discipline since dressage became an Olympic 
sport more than 100 years ago.

It brings Team GB’s Olympics medal tally in equestrian sports to five, double their previous record.

The British team may now be the reigning Olympic dressage champions but spectators would be forgiven for wondering what this most rarefied of equine sports is all about.

The discipline dubbed "horse dancing" may not look as challenging as the imposing fences on a cross-country course or possess the theatrical element of showjumping, but it is a highly technical test for both horse and rider.

Today's event, the individual freestyle to music, was dressage in its most elevated form.

The contest allows the rider to choreograph a routine which must combine a certain number of complex movements within a six minute time frame.

This is then set to music which should complement the performance.

Edward Gal of the Netherlands competes in the Individual dressage today - the event requires years of practice and an amazing affinity between rider and horse

Each rider is marked on his or her technical and artistic expertise, with judges scrutinising rhythm, harmony and the choice of music.

Higher points are likely to be awarded when riders attempt particularly challenging manoeuvres.

Of particular note is the pirouette - where the animal effectively turns a full circle, with its hind-quarters at the centre - and the piaffe, a highly collected and cadenced trot where the horse remains in one place.

In each case, the rider must put his or her mount through its paces, performing more complex movements than are seen in the team event.

Producing these results takes years of training as a horse must learn to respond to a series of hand and leg signals.

Over time, it will come to associate tiny shifts in the rider's position with certain movements.

The objective is for the combination to work calmly together with top marks going to the most elegant partnerships.

The goal should always be to achieve harmony between horse and rider, with the animal showing a willingness to perform.

A routine should not look forced and riders can use any music they wish - with the competition showcasing everything from Tchaikovsky to The Black Eyed Peas.

The use of sound effects, such as Dujardin's decision to incorporate the chimes of Big Ben - is also encouraged.

Results are determined by combining both technical and artistic marks and the final score is shown as a percentage.

Dressage has been an Olympic sport since 1912. It was a discipline reserved for army officers until 1952 when it became a mixed event.
