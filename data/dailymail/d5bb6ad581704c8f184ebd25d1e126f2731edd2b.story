Cesc Fabregas faces Arsenal as a Chelsea player for the first time on Sunday.

He’s been away in Spain for the past three years and we only hope he hasn’t forgotten the code of conduct which exists on these shores relating to players and their former clubs.

Just in case he needs a refresher, here’s Sportsmail’s quick guide…

Get out, get in… When Fabregas arrives at Stamford Bridge there are sure to be plenty of Arsenal fans in attendance. OK, sign their programme, but do not pose for selfies or engage in lingering conversation about the Invincibles. In fact, have you still got those oversized headphones from the adidas World Cup advert?

It’s all change, but don’t change your changing room… Fabregas has still played at Stamford Bridge more times for Arsenal than he has for Chelsea. So just be careful which dressing-room you end up in. It’s the one marked ‘HOME’.

Warm your muscles, not your vocal chords… It is a familiar sight, former players bouncing around the halfway line waiting for an old pal to chat with. Don’t do it, just get on with the pre-match warm-up. Send them a WhatsApp from the changing room instead.

Cesc, give us a wave… Don’t. Poor Harry Redknapp fell foul of that recently on his return to Tottenham. You’ve got to resist all invites to exchange in-game pleasantries with the fans who once isolised you.

Celebration time… Again, don’t. Don’t celebrate ANY goal – for Arsenal or Chelsea. You’ve got to remain stony-faced throughout. You’re a professional, goals disgust you. No, you’ve got to behave as if 0-0 would be the dream outcome.

I’ve scored, but I wish I hadn’t… Inside you may well be buzzing with your 25-yard rocket in to the top corner, but don’t let it show. You’ve got to make out as if Row Z was your intended target and the shot took a horrible dip in to the back of the net. These new balls, honestly.

The post-match interview… Do not conduct your media duties wearing Jack Wilshere’s shirt. And, when asked the inevitable about the reception from Arsenal fans, reply with the dutiful and well-worn ‘it was nice, I enjoyed my time there, I always look for their result and I wish them all the best for the season ahead’. Back-page stuff, eh?
