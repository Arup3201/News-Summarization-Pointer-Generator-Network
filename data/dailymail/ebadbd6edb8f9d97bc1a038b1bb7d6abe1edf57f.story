'You know, my consultant keeps telling me death could come at any moment,’ Sir John Tavener told an interviewer two weeks ago.

He laughed as he said it, because Tavener - undoubtedly one of the leading British composers of the past century - had been cheating death for more than three decades.

Since June 1980, in fact, when a stroke hit him while driving one of his beloved Rolls-Royces back from the Aldeburgh Festival in Suffolk.

The Lord's Tavener: His work reflected a deep religious belief

It temporarily damaged his left arm and hand, and his vocal cords were permanently impaired.

But he battled on, enduring several major heart operations, until this week the death he had avoided for so long finally claimed him.

I had hoped to see him this weekend at the premiere of three new choral pieces to be given at Southwark Cathedral, but alas it is not to be. The recital by an Icelandic choir will continue as a tribute.

John Tavener, who died at 69, was hugely tall - 6ft 6in - and extremely thin, with long bony arms. He suffered from Marfan Syndrome, a genetic disorder which attacks the heart, and which affects some people with that body shape.

His health had been in terminal decline for months - he had to take 15 pills a day for years. But he kept working, regarding his afflictions as a test of his profound religious belief, which dominated his life and entire creative thinking.

My friend John Suchet, Classic FM’s morning presenter, described to me yesterday how he was speaking at an arts festival in Dorset last June about his favourite subject, Beethoven, when he was astonished to see John Tavener wheeled in by his devoted wife Maryanna.

Early fans: Sir John, pictured here with Sir Paul McCartney, was a friend of the Beatles and released an early work called The Whale on their Apple record label

John rushed over to speak to him. Tavener’s first question was typical: ‘Was Beethoven religious?’

John replied there was no evidence Beethoven went to church of his own volition, but his later music reveals a deep spirituality, perhaps arising out of his own suffering.

Tavener nodded; he knew better than anyone what suffering does to the creative spirit.

Some it destroys; others it enhances. And I profoundly believe that physical suffering was the making of John Tavener as a composer.

For he was a man unrecognisable for the past three decades from the show-off I first encountered in an apartment adjacent to the Dorchester hotel in the late Sixties.

Then in his early 20s, Tavener was kitted out in velvet, looking like a cross between Wilde and Byron.

And it was hard, at first glance, to know on which side of the sexual fence he had placed himself.

But since he was going out with the sister of my hostess, Arianna Stassinopoulos - later the founder of the Huffington Post website - I, not without some hesitation, inclined towards the Byronic.

Royal approval: Sir John was also a friend of Prince Charles - the two are pictured here together in 1998 after a Tavener concert at St Paul's Cathedral

Raised in a Presbyterian family - which ran a building firm - in  Wembley Park, North-West London, he had won a music scholarship to Highgate School before studying at the Royal College of Music.

At the time we met, he had just enjoyed a huge success with The Whale, a bizarre cantata filled with all manner of curious electronic effects, that had so impressed The Beatles, they paid to have it recorded on their new Apple label.

Tavener had befriended Ringo Starr after the composer’s brother had done renovation work on the drummer’s house.

Ringo introduced Tavener to John Lennon, who was very taken by a recital the slender musician gave him of an opera he had written.

It was this unlikely association that led Apple to release The Whale in 1968 - which featured Ringo yelling through a loud-hailer.

Spiritual: Sir John finally found peace and fulfillment in the Greek Orthodox Church

(Tavener himself credited Ringo as being largely responsible for the release of The Whale and another Apple album, Celtic Requiem.)

This, then, was the man I encountered at that party: with his long, flowing blond locks, and beautiful, monk-like visage, he was quite the cat’s whiskers, and preened himself like a prize-winning Persian pussy.

Being myself then a scrofulous undergraduate who thought charisma was December 25, I can tell you I resented him like mad.

A few years after that evening, in November 1974, Tavener married a young Greek dancer called Victoria Maragopoulou, who had been training at the Royal Ballet School.

Though the composer’s father bought the couple a house in North-West London, Tavener refused to move away from his mother.

It was an unhappy union, and just eight months later they parted. Incredibly, the marriage appears to have been unconsummated - and was annulled.

Years later Tavener, said cryptically: ‘I matured very quickly in some ways, very slowly in others. I think I’ll leave it at that.’

Despite this, he developed a reputation as a playboy - largely because he liked to drive a Rolls and mix with famous people. At one point he escorted the actress Mia Farrow, and befriended Prince Charles.

In a 1995 biography, he was described as having an obsession with charismatic older women - and a penchant for nubile ‘Muses’ in their 20s.

Recognition: Sir John was knighted in 2000 for services to music

It was in 1991 that he married again, to Maryanna Schaefer, whom he had first encountered six years before when she was just 20.

In one interview, Tavener revealed he married her only on the condition they had no children. Yet she proceeded to do just that. ‘Yes. She slipped them in,’ he admitted with a smile.

He had been ‘terrified’ that having children would ruin his creativity, but confessed that despite the hurly-burly of family life - he and Maryanna had a son and two daughters - he ‘just carried on writing’.

And carry on writing he did. In 1997, his Song For Athene was played at Princess Diana’s funeral - he later said it was the only good piece played that day.

For my part, the scales really fell from my eyes where Tavener is concerned more than two decades after I met him, when I put on a new recording by that master cellist Steven Isserlis of a new piece by Tavener called The Protecting Veil.

In it, the cello plays continuously at the top of its range throughout this extraordinary 45-minute meditation.

The music has an intensity, an ecstatic brilliance, that could have been composed only by a genius, which is what I now profoundly believe Tavener to have been.

Sadly, I had little or no chance to follow up on that memorable meeting years before. Had I done so, I dare say I would have recognised a very different man from the self-adoring figure I had encountered.

For Tavener, life was a spiritual journey. Though he never quite abandoned his love of opulent cars, French restaurants and red wine. ‘Every time I have a hit, I buy a Rolls,’ he once quipped.

His journey towards spiritual truth began as a teenage organist in a London Presbyterian church, and finally brought him peace and fulfilment in the Greek Orthodox Church.

His profound religious sense was coupled with a range of often extreme and deeply eccentric opinions.

In interviews, he would always sound a bit odd, because he probably was in truth pretty odd. ‘I feel a connection with pine trees,’ he told a recent interviewer, straight faced.

Genius: When composing, Sir John said he went into 'another world, another state'

And his view that serious music ended when it stopped being created for God, was, to put it mildly, eccentric in the extreme.

Happily he lived to repent of that, telling John Suchet about the joy he derived from Beethoven, and other 19th-century composers whom he had once dismissed.

For him, his work was his salvation. And his faith allowed him to work with great intensity. When composing, he said, he went into ‘another world, another state’.

Everything he produced apparently required no rewrites, as if he was a chosen instrument through which heavenly sounds were transmitted.

His faith also gave him the forbearance to endure the endless criticism his music received: Too eclectic... no discernible development...   ‘Holy mush’... Tavener probably saw that one as a compliment.

While writing this, I have spent an agreeable couple of hours listening to some of Tavener’s finest achievements.

I emerge confirmed in my view of his stature, and feeling cleansed by the experience. This is surely the heart of his appeal.

His music is not always sophisticated, but it is totally sincere. Its sense of religious certainty appeals even to those like myself who are not formally religious. All of us long for a spiritual dimension in our lives, and Tavener’s music provides it.

Not only that, anyone with a musical sense can appreciate it. He certainly wasn’t one of those contemporary composers who thinks if his music is popular, it can’t be any good.

Many years ago, Benjamin Britten - an early fan of Tavener - got the younger composer absolutely right. ‘He adores the past, and he builds on the past,’ Britten wrote.

I am sad that Tavener is gone, and deeply distressed at all he had to endure for so long. But it made him the composer he became.

He leaves behind a formidable body of work, one I believe will last. He observed that: ‘I can look back over [my] work and say I’m not ashamed of it. That’s a good feeling.’

I would argue he is part of that great European choral tradition that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This unique and fascinating man would have looked for no higher praise than that.
