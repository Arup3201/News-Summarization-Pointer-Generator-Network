Danny Welbeck will show the full extent of his qualities after his deadline day move to Arsenal, says former England striker Emile Heskey.

The £16 million signing from Manchester United has made the right move, says Heskey, and will have a chance to shine under Arsene Wenger.

'He has got the ability to do well there [at Arsenal],' Heskey told TalkSport. 'I think their style of play will suit him. People don’t realise how good he is.'

'[His ability] on the ball, his movement and his pace, those three things will help you, especially in an Arsenal team.'

Welbeck leaves a squad now stacked with star strikers after Radamel Falcao's deadline day arrival for a side with a critical void - after Olivier Giroud's injury Arsene Wenger's only genuine striker was the raw and unproven talent of Yaya Sanogo.

The 23-year-old will jump ahead of the young Frenchman in the queue and have a chance to show United the talent they have sparingly unleashed in recent seasons.

'He seems like a player who actually listens to what his manager wants,' Heskey says. 'He will be exciting for Arsenal.

'He will get a bit of a run [while Olivier Giroud is out] and then you will see the best of him. There is no reason why he can’t do well at Arsenal.'
