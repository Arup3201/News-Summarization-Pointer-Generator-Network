A Comcast customer grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges.

The man, who declined to give his real name but calls himself ‘Tim Davis’ online, posted his exchanges on YouTube on Sunday and claims the company only refunded him $182 in unnecessary charges after he played them his recording of the exchanges.

The incident came about after Tim moved to a new apartment in Eugene, Oregon, a month ago and installed his modem and set up his Wi-Fi himself.

A Comcast customer, calling himself 'Tim Davis', grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges

The problem started when Tim checked his next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue

Not long after, his internet connection began to stop working for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and so he called Comcast to complain.

Together, Tim and the representative figured out that the problem was caused by the cable outside of the apartment and that it wasn't his fault. 

Based on his previous experience with the cable company, Tim asked the representative to confirm wouldn't be charged for the repair. This assurance was captured on tape.

A Comcast technician then visited the building where Tim lives and fixed the problem.

The problem started when Tim checked his 
next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install
 his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue.

On top of that, Tim was also he was charged another $50 for having Comcast set up his Wi-Fi network - again something that Tim had already done himself.

When he called Comcast to query the charges, Tim was put on hold for an hour before he hung up.

Eventually he spoke with a rep called Daisy who informed him that Comcast had subtracted $100 from his bill for 'service discounts.'

Despite his bill being more than halved, Tim said he was still unhappy about the charges.

Next, he was offered an upgrade to a faster internet service. The offer was worth less than the $82 that Comcast was still asking Tim to pay and so he said no.

Next, Daisy told him that there was simply no way she could remove the charges or reimburse his account.

Tim then revealed that he had a recording of a phone call in which Comcast told him he wouldn't be charged.

Finally, Comcast backed down and gave him back his money.

'Why were you not able to do that before?' Tim asked.

Taking the blame: An internal memo from Comcast COO Dave Watson blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics

'Again, 
that is a valid charge,' Daisy said. 'But since I advised my manager 
that there is a recording, and you were misinformed, then he's the one 
who can approve that $82.'

'You're telling me that if I didn't have a recording of that call, you wouldn't have been able to do it,' he said.

'That is correct, yes.'

Tim, who works as a senior IT analyst for a large company, posted about his experience with Comcast on Reddit and received a deluge of people with similar experiences.

Last
 month, Comcast made headlines after another customer recorded and 
published a phone call with customer service. In that call, a Comcast 
rep refused to let a couple cancel their service when they wanted to 
switch cable and Internet providers.

A
 leaked memo reveals that high-ranking executives at Comcast admit the 
excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly 
their fault.

The company's chief operating officer Dave Watson says in his memo that the nagging, begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by Ryan Block was part of what Comcast paid and trained the employee to do.

'It was painful to listen to this call, and I am not surprised that we have been criticized for it,' Watson says in the document first leaked to Consumerist.

The memo 
surfaced just a week after the call to Engadget founder Ryan Block--who 
recorded it and put it on Soundcloud, where it's now been played over 5 
million times--went viral.

'We
 are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to 
the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote.

Comcast is currently seeking regulatory 
approval to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, a deal that would 
make the largest cable company in the world even bigger.

Critics of the 
deal argue that a telecom so large would have even less reason to offer 
decent customer service.
