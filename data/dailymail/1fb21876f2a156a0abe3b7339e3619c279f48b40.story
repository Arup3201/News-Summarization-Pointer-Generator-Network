A British holidaymaker jailed in Morocco for being gay has had the charges he faced formally dropped following his return home to the UK.

Ray Cole, 70, was imprisoned for four months with his Moroccan friend Jamal Jam Wald Nass after homosexual images were found on his phone.

The pair were left languishing in a crowded Marrakesh jail described as a 'concentration camp', but were eventually granted a conditional release.

Now Mr Cole has disclosed that the charges the pair faced have been formally dropped by the Moroccan authorities.

In a Facebook message to his supporters, Mr Cole, from Deal, Kent, said they could now 'put this horrible episode behind us'.

He added: 'Happy though I am for this, it doesn't take away the memory of the appalling treatment in the police station and the frightening conditions in the prison.

'The overwhelming feeling of fear and isolation will stay with me for the rest of my life, I think.

'Even though I was held for just three weeks, at the time I had no idea of when I would get out and see my loved ones again. It seemed like an eternity, and all for what? Nothing!

'Just because I'm a gay man. And because they could! There are no winners. Morocco's reputation as a safe holiday destination was shattered and inquiries dropped by around 50 per cent, although it will recover.

'And it cost me in the region of £7,000 personally. So that's my travelling days finished! So I'm happy that it's all over, but sorry that the Moroccan authorities haven't yet offered any apology or compensation.

'I'm not holding my breath.'

Mr Cole's son Adrian, 41, said the family were relieved to have finally gained a resolution and to now put the matter behind them.

He said: 'We understand that this is the first time that anyone has had this type of effect on a Muslim society's judicial system.'

The case generated huge interest on social media from supporters who urged the Moroccan authorities to free retired Mr Cole.

As well as a petition, a Free Ray Cole hashtag circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page was set up calling for the release of Mr Cole, who has a minor heart condition.

He struck up a friendship with Mr Nass, who is in his 20s, on Facebook. It was on Mr Cole's second visit to Morocco to see him that they were detained at a bus stop by officers.

Mr Cole was four weeks into a five-week break in the north African country when the pair were held on September 18.

Confusion initially reigned over where he was being held until he was eventually tracked down.

On October 2 his family received a phone call telling them the pair had been jailed for four months. They had feared a six-month jail term as a worst-case scenario.

He was kept in a cell intended for 44 men which was holding 60, forcing Mr Cole to sleep on the ground and live with dangerous prisoners.

The Foreign Office website says homosexuality is a criminal offence in Morocco. It states: 'Sexual relations outside marriage are also punishable by law.'

But Mr Cole's local MP, Conservative Charlie Elphicke, described the charges as 'medieval' and said it showed British tourists were not safe in Morocco.

Former deputy speaker of the House of Commons Nigel Evans also attacked the 'archaic' law that sent Mr Cole to prison.
