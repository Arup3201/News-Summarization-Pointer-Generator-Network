It is an unusual - although many would argue easy - way to make a quick buck.

A U.S. organisation is offering willing volunteers $40 (£25) for every deposit of poo they make - and it's all for a good cause.

The stool samples are being used to fight the superbug C. difficile - in the form of a faecal transplant. 

The treatment is being hailed by many doctors as a 'miracle' cure for patients where all other treatments - such as antibiotics - have failed.

C. difficile is a bacterial infection that most commonly affects elderly hospital patients.

It causes severe diarrhoea, fever and painful cramps. It can also result in life-threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel.

Patients with recurrent C. difficile only have a 75 per cent chance of survival and are often ill for many months.

However mounting evidence shows stool transplants from healthy donors can help restore the balance of 'good' bacteria in the gut to fight infections. 

If successful, the patient starts to feel better almost immediately.

Now, OpenBiome, the only independent non-profit stool bank in the U.S., is on the hunt for regular stool donors - who can earn up to $250 (£156 a week).

The organisation was formed in 2012 after the founder watched a friend and family member suffer for 18 months before receiving a successful, life-changing transplant of faecal microbiota. 

It now provides a service collecting, testing and providing life-saving faecal samples to 122 hospitals in 33 states. 

'Think of us as a blood bank, but for poop,' founder Mark Smith told Boston.com. 'You shouldn’t have to fly across the country to get poop.'

He added that cost-wise, it saves on average  $17,000 per patient compared to treatment with antibiotics.

And each stool sample can treat up to five patients.  

In healthy people the bacteria C. difficile lies harmlessly in the gut.

But the feared infection is caused when antibiotics upset the balance of the intestines.

While natural bacteria that protect against infection are decimated by the drugs, C. difficile multiply. 

Faecal transplantation was first developed in 1958 but rarely used.

However, in 2011, a Dutch study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that 94 per cent of people with recurrent C. difficile could be cured using faecal transplants.

This can be compared to a cure rate of just 31 per cent of people with recurrent infection who are treated with antibiotics.

It is most effective in patients who have recurrent C. difficile and who have been treated with antibiotics so many times that they are no longer effective.

It works because the solution contains 'good' bacteria which fight the infection. If successful, the patient starts to feel better almost immediately.

Mr Smith works with gastroenterologists and various other academics to get stool samples to towns and cities within a two - and even four-hour radius. 

OpenBiome sells hospitals and independent doctors stool samples for $250 a sample. 

This is the price for a transplant via colonoscopy or enema. 

Alternatively, 30ml sample for a nasal transplant can be purchased for the same price. 

In this process, a nasogastric tube runs from the nose into the digestive tract. 

And the criteria to be a donor? Volunteers must be between 18 and 50, have regular bowel movements and make daily trips to the laboratory in Medford, Massachusetts.

At least four donations a week are required, according to the company's website. 

It says: 'Donors receive $40 per sample. 

'If they come in five days in one week, they receive an extra $50. Prospective donors also receive $40 for getting tested.' 

They must also have a body mass index under 30, have taken no antibiotics in the past three months and not travelled or been born outside the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in the past year. 

Strict medical screening is in place. Potential donors fill out a detailed medical questionnaire and their stools are tested for infections, plus the health of the bacteria.

Blood is also screened for conditions such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. 

Donating involves a 30-minute visit, where a sample is deposited into a bowl that rests over the toilet, Boston.com reports. 

The company even tries to inject humour into the process. 

There are incentives - such as becoming a 'super pooper' - or providing the biggest single donation of the month - and dubious-sounding nicknames such as Vladimir Pootin, or Winnie the Pooh.

OpenBiome also encourages donors how to be more productive, so to speak - namely plenty of fibre. 

Just earlier this week, Boston scientists said C. difficile could be treated using capsules of frozen faeces from healthy people.

The idea behind the pills was to avoid a more invasive method of faecal transplant.  

The researchers developed a method whereby they could freeze healthy stool samples, enclosing them in capsules for patients to swallow. 

They successfully cured 18 of 20 patients who took part in the study at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston of their diarrohea, improving their condition.

All the patients had suffered at least three bouts of mild to moderate C. difficile and failed to get better after being given standard antibiotics.

The study is published the Journal of the American Medical Association.

And last year, Dr Robert Porter, at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, treated the man by pumping his daughter's faeces through his nose and down into his small bowel.

The treatment involves mixing stools from a donor - ideally a family member - with saline solution and transferring it by tube through the patient's nose. 

Dr Porter said: 'Even in the medical world, the topic is a bit of an eyebrow raiser and people are surprised to hear it's so effective.

‘But in recent years we've seen a rise in more aggressive forms of C. difficile and higher mortality rates, with standard treatments becoming less effective.’

He added: ‘One of the reasons this has not been particularly popular up until now is that we haven't had good studies to back it up.

‘Then we had an open trial in The Netherlands, which was stopped early because it was so effective compared to normal therapies.

‘An ethics committee ruled that it was doing so well it would be unfair to continue other methods.

‘It has given us the basis to say we have safe, scientific evidence that this is a very good treatment and very safe as well.'
