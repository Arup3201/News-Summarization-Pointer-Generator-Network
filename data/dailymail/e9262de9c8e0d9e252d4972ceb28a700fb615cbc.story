Ronny Deila had his ‘Welcome to Glasgow’ moment three weeks ago. The instant when he realised his life was no longer a private affair. Like most of what passes for social interaction in Scotland’s largest city, it happened late one night in a pub in the centre of town.

‘I was outside waiting for a taxi to go home and decided to go into the nearest pub to get a beer,’ recalled the Norwegian. ‘I realise now I shouldn’t do that.

‘I was there for 15 minutes and everyone was very friendly. People wanted to talk to me about Celtic and have their picture taken with me and things like that.

‘It was okay, you get used to that. It’s fantastic that it’s so positive. Nothing has been negative. People tell me they want me to succeed and the Celtic supporters have been amazing.

‘Everyone was very polite — but it was too much.’

Reality check: Ronny Deila's reign as Celtic manager has got off to an eventful start

Deila is reluctant to cut himself off, but realises now there may be no other way.

Describing himself as a naturally sociable character, he comes across as a man’s man. Personable and likeable, he pitches up for press conferences in jeans, eschewing the formal informality of a club training kit.

As yet, he shows no sign of changing. Two months into the job there is no wariness of the media. No evidence of the Old Firm lobotomy so often performed on Glasgow footballing figures indoctrinated into a life at Celtic or Rangers.

A father of twin daughters, his grounded normality is unusual in a working environment where men have been known to lose touch with reality.

At Stromsgodset, Deila was used to engagement with fans and journalists. It was a relaxed and undemanding affair. In contrast, Celtic are a very different animal. A club where a degree of detachment is usually encouraged to prevent a manager drowning in the goldfish bowl of Glasgow urban life.

‘Before, I was working almost automatically - but now I have to push myself to new limits,’ he admitted.

‘That’s why I am here and I know I can cope with it. It has been hard but every day has been fantastic also. Everywhere I go, it’s new.

‘I don’t want to find I’m just spinning around in the washing machine. You have to come out of it sometimes to reflect. If you are a leader, you need to reflect.

‘You need time by yourself to see the next step, and you have to always be a step ahead. It’s been hard in the beginning but, over time, it will become easier.’

He made sacrifices to move to Glasgow. The money is certainly better, which helps. But, at 38, Deila finds himself adapting to a new country, a new city, a new working environment to anything he has experienced before. All without the foundation and stability provided by his daughters.

‘My family haven’t come over,’ he revealed. ‘I am not together with the mother of my children. I am single now and my two kids wanted to stay in Norway.

‘They will visit me when they have a vacation and I’ll go see them whenever there is an international break. It’s been the hardest thing, it’s very hard.

‘But when you do this, you sacrifice everything. They wanted me to do this, though, and I couldn’t say no.

‘They knew I’d regret it for the rest of my life if I didn’t come here. But ask any big manager if they made sacrifices and they’ll all say, “Yes”. This is not a job, it’s a lifestyle.

Sacrifice: Deila left his family behind at home to take the Celtic job

‘It’s 24 hours a day, thinking all the time. You can say you’re going home but you’re always doing the job, thinking about it in your mind. There are so many decisions to make all the time that it has to be that way.

‘But with my kids, I asked them what they thought about me coming here, I asked them if it was okay with them. They saw in my face, though, that they couldn’t say no. I think I manipulated them pretty well…

‘But they are proud of me, I can see that. They are 14 years old and very active, playing handball and football, too. Their mother is fantastic with them, as well, so I know they will be having a good time.’

A more carefree existence, certainly, than their father.

The opening weeks of Deila’s Celtic career have been a challenge. The doomsday scenario of an early Champions League exit was a reality until a registration error in Warsaw changed everything.

There were dark, sleepless nights after the loss to Poland’s champions. Deila turns a corner in Glasgow and finds the ubiquitous presence of Sky Sports News everywhere he goes – ‘people here are unbelievably interested in football’.

For days, he couldn’t escape the impact of a 6-1 aggregate defeat. He was forced to find his own ways of relaxing.

‘For me, training is important,’ he said. ‘I go out running. I also like being with friends and talking with them.

‘I have people visiting me at the moment and that’s good because I’m a social person. I have also got my golf clubs now and have been trying to use them at the course next to where I am staying.

‘Other than that, I just like to relax and watch television, but that’s something I haven’t done for seven weeks. I also haven’t gone to see a movie.’

Today, he takes a long-awaited trip to the theatre. To the football stadium he wants to fulfil his artistic ambitions for the next few years.

In the aftermath of his unveiling as manager, the Scandinavian had precious little access to Celtic Park.

The Commonwealth Games had the run of the place, the pitch was torn up and the football team were displaced, forced to fulfil a pre-season tour more suited to the Harlem Globetrotters.

On Wednesday, Deila finally wondered on to the newly-laid pitch and stood in the centre circle surveying his surroundings ahead of his first home game against Dundee United this lunchtime.

‘It’s going to be huge,’ he admitted. ‘I walked into Celtic Park for the first time since my press conference on Wednesday - it’s okay to go in there to see what to expect.

‘You come to a new country, a new language, a new city.

‘You come to a new staff and new players and you have to cope with that.

‘Everywhere you go is a new place. Even going to your stadium and playing in front of 60,000 people.

‘These things are what you have to prepare for in your mind and be ready for.

‘I said many times it’s my dream; to play fantastic football against good teams in a full Celtic Park. Money is nothing compared to that. Trophies are nothing compared to that.

‘It’s the ultimate experience and it’s what I have in my mind.

‘Wednesday was the first time I have walked on the Parkhead pitch.

‘I was in the stands for the Barcelona game last year. I had a press conference on my first day. But I hadn’t been since.

‘Now I’m really looking forward to it.’

He travelled to Aberdeen with Football Development Manager John Park to watch Dundee United demolish the home team at Pittodrie last Sunday. He saw nothing to alter some stubbornly held core beliefs.

‘We have better players than the other teams,’ he continued. ‘So we don’t go to Celtic Park and just stay back.

‘If we do, there is something wrong. Then you are afraid to lose. And I am not afraid to lose.

“I would rather lose than play bad football. We are talking about Celtic Park now.’

To call somewhere in Scotland ‘home’ will be a strange, but welcome, sensation. An important step on the road to where he wants to be as Celtic manager.

‘There have been some tough weeks here,’ he admitted. ‘But you feel you are living and learning.

‘You can sit in automatic mode and do everything in remote control.

‘But now I have to push myself to new limits – that’s why I did this. Whatever happens here I know I can cope with this now.’
