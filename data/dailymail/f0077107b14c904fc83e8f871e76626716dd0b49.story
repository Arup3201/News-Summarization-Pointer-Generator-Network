Most of us will have a favourite fast food chain, but this retired couple are taking their love of burgers to the extreme.

Carol, 73, and Karl Hoepfner, 75, of Rockport, Texas, are planning to visit all 722 locations of Whataburger across 10 U.S. states.

The couple have incredibly already managed to eat more than 7,000 meals at their local Whataburger restaurant in Rockport.

Happy couple: Carol, 73, and Karl Hoepfner, 75, of Texas, are planning to visit all 722 locations of Whataburger - and have already done 225

They were named 'Whataburger’s Biggest Fans' and their first visit to a restaurant was almost 50 years ago in San Angelo, Texas.

Mr Hoepfner: 590 calories

Plain Whataburger (beef patty 250 calories) with onions (10 calories), jalapeños (0 calories), and toasted buns (with oil: 330 calories)

Mrs Hoepfner: 280 calories

Justaburger (beef patty 120 calories) with onions (5 calories) and toasted buns (with oil: 155 calories)

The couple decided to visit all 722 restaurants after being awarded the prize in April and have already done almost 3,000 miles across Texas.

The couple were awarded $10,000 in prizes for winning the competition including Whataburger for life.

They asked for 1,000 $7 gift cards in their prize, which they gave to the poor, charity and emergency services.

Next on the list is a trip to Arizona. The couple claim to have visited more than 100 countries but never found anything better than a Whataburger.

‘Whataburger played a part in our deciding to retire in Texas,’ Mr Hoepfner said. ‘That way, we could be near the best hamburger in the world.

‘We have travelled the world over, to more than 100 countries, and have never found a better hamburger than yours.’

The couple have decided to do the burger marathon despite their age and the fact that Mrs Hoepfner finished chemotherapy for eye cancer this year.

The couple’s 225th restaurant on their tour was to the company’s flagship location, Whataburger by the Bay, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Mr Hoepfner is keeping a binder with photos, signatures and receipts entitled ‘Whataburger’s Biggest Fans - Travel Journal’.

His favourite order at Whataburger is for a plain burger with grilled onions, jalapeños, and toasted buns, reported the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.

'We've visited 225 of them so far, but we don't eat at them all or we'd weigh like 300lbs'

Karl Hoepfner

‘It’s a balanced meal,’ he said. ‘You got your salad, bread, and meat.’

Mrs Hoepfner goes for a Justaburger with grilled onions and toasted buns.

Mr Hoepfner bases his assessment of a Whataburger on how many serviettes it requires - six is ‘very good’ and seven is ‘outstanding’.
