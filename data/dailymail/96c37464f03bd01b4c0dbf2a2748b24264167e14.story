A breathtaking video has emerged showing a group of base jumpers throwing themselves from the top of a skyscraper and landing perfectly in a nearby rooftop pool.

The stunt, recorded by a GoPro camera attached to the second jumper's helmet, was attempted from the top of Malaysia's 1100ft-high Kuala Lumpur Tower.

The recording shows base jumpers John Van Horne, Matt Frolich and Andy Lewis walking along the edge of the skyscraper at night with the brightly illuminated city visible below them, before jumping off in succession.

The first base jumper in the group of three readies himself to jump from the Kuala Lumpur Tower

The camera, attached to the helmet of the second jumper, records his initial fall

The second jumper then prepares himself for his leap. His target, a nearby rooftop pool, is not yet visible

During his descent he positions himself to land in the pool pictured on the roof of the building to the right

As he nears the water, the crowd surrounding the pool lets off a large cheer

He makes a perfect landing in the centre of the hotel pool and then pulls himself from the water

He manages to get out in time to see the third and final jumper land in the water a minute after him

The heartstopping stunt begins when the first man visible on camera leaps from the balcony and is filmed falling towards the city below.

It then cuts to footage of the camera-wearing jumper, as he launches himself from the edge of the tower, pulls open his parachute, and begins aligning himself for the approach to the rooftop pool below.

As he nears the water, a crowd can be seen gathered around the water in anticipation of his landing.

He hits the pool successfully to loud cheers.

He then pulls himself out of the water and watches the third base jumper in his group land a minute later.

Base jumpers are renowned for their adrenaline seeking urban stunts.

In August, a pair of thrill-seeking base jumpers leaped from the 48th floor of a London skyscraper. 

The video, recorded by cameras attached to the jumpers themselves, showed the two visiting the Attic Bar at Pan Peninsula in Canary Wharf.

They pretend they are regular customers and even drink a beer before entering the toilets, attaching their parachutes and leaping from the bar's smoking balcony into the streets below.
