Incredible footage has emerged of heat-stricken koalas being cooled down by rescuers as bushfires continue to ravage through South Australia.

One piece of footage shows the tiny bundle of fur  drinking from a red drink bottle of water after a firefighter came to its rescue in the Adelaide Hills on Friday.

Feeding the marsupial water, the thirsty koala looked severely burned as the rescuer is seen stroking and scratching its head in the bushland as it embraces the drink.

Another heartfelt video was posted onto Facebook by local resident Kerry Goldsworthy on Friday after she came home to find a 'very hot and thirsty koala' in her front yard.

'I'm going to remember this forever,' she posted.

'He drank for 15 minutes straight before looking much better and climbing a tree.

'When we first got home he was lying on the hot concrete trying to get shade behind the wheelie bins.'

The woman can be seen pouring a plastic jug of water into the little furry creature's mouth as it drinks and cools down. She also pours the water over its head to cool down the parched koala.

The video has received over 450,000 views, more than 16,500 shares and a significant amount of comments from friends and strangers.

The two videos comes after Sam the koala grabbed global headlines when a photograph had gone viral of her drinking from a firefighter's water bottle during the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria in 2009.

She was a symbol of hope and happiness for the survivors despite the grief as raging blaze swept through killing more than 200 people.

Koalas are particularly vulnerable due to their slow movements and the flammability of their main food source, eucalyptus trees.

As firefighters fear more homed are at risk, they continue to battle against a wave of extreme blaze before hot weather scorches the state again on Wednesday.

A watch and act alert is active for the Sampson Flat bushfire, in the Mount Lofty ranges, which has been burning since Friday, and has claimed almost 13,000 hectares of scrub and farmland. 

At least a dozen of homes have been destroyed and South Australia's premier Jay Weatherill said another 20 are likely to have been lost in the inferno.

South Australia is enduring the state's worst fire conditions since the Ash Wednesday blaze in 1983, in which 28 people died.

The raging fires have significantly affected farms and other private land in the area, causing wide ranging damage to crops and leaving many animals in danger.
