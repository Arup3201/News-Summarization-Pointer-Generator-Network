Three African Union soldiers and a civilian contractor were killed when al-Shabab militants raided a Somali military base which also houses the British Embassy.

The gunmen, some disguised in Somali National Army uniforms, stormed the African Union (AU) camp near Mogadishu Airport, opening fire during the Christmas Day lunch hour.

Five of the extremists were also killed during the raid, around a mile from the British Embassy, while four were captured, officials said.

Terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was targeting a Christmas party at the compound, which also houses the Italian embassy and United Nations offices. 

The men entered the AU base near Mogadishu's airport, spokesman Colonel Ali Aden Houmed said.

'Our forces shot dead three of them, two detonated themselves near a fuel depot,' he added.

'An investigation is under way on how they entered the base.'

In an audio posting on the militants' website, al-Shabab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said the attack was carried out in retaliation for the killing of the group's leader Ahmed Abdi Godane in a US air strike this year.

In the attack, Rage claimed the gunmen killed 14 AU soldiers and four foreigners, but the group often exaggerates the number of people it kills.

The British Embassy in Mogadishu, which opened last year, was unaffected by the attack

A spokesman for the Foreign & Commonwealth Office said: 'For the British Embassy, the first thing to do was to check everyone was safe and accounted for, which they were.

'The attack took place 1.6km (one mile) from the Embassy. Staff are on high alert for this kind of attack.' 

Ali Abdullahi, who lives near the airport, said all roads leading to the airport were closed off following the shoot-out and journalists were also kept away.

AU troops are bolstering Somalia's weak government against an uprising from the al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab extremist group.

A suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into a UN convoy near Mogadishu's airport earlier this month, killing three people just moments after Somalia's president entered the airport. No UN staff were injured. 

Al-Shabab controlled much of Mogadishu from 2007 to 2011, but were pushed out of Somalia's capital city by AU forces.
