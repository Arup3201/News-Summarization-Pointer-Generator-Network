Chris Wood came off the bench to earn a dramatic draw for Leicester on their return to the Premier League after 10 years away. The 22-year New Zealander striker slammed home late on to sent the home crowd wild and install a belief that perhaps this won’t be a campaign of struggle after all.

Everton had threatened to burst the Foxes’ comeback bubble after taking two leads, first via Aiden McGeady and then Steven Naismith, either side of a Leicester goal on his debut from record £8m signing Leonardo Ulloa. But Wood’s strike gave the hosts a point - and a 12th draw with Everton in 17 Premier League meetings now, all-time.

This was Leicester’s first Premier League match after 10 long years in the wilderness. Their last top-flight match was a 2-1 defeat to Arsenal. Their manager was Micky Adams, their scorer was Paul Dickov, netting against the ‘Invincibles’ Gunners team of Bergkamp, Henry, Vieira, Ljungberg et al.

Since dropping at the end of that 2003-04 campaign, Leicester have been as low as League One, have changed owners to become part of a Thai Duty Free empire - and been through 15 different managerial teams, caretakers included.

Nigel Pearson, in charge since late 2011, has been transformative and his team started brightly, not bowed by the occasion. The first chance, albeit speculative, came as Anthony Knockaert floated a long shot from the left. It shouldn’t have troubled Tim Howard but it was dipping just below the crossbar when he grabbed it shakily.

Everton’s John Stones caught the eye at right-back with a decent understanding with McGeady on the flank ahead of him. McGeady’s 11th-minute shot was straight at Kasper Schmeichel but a sign of the danger ahead.

The opener came in the 20th minute, impetus courtesy of Leighton Baines’ low driven shot, deflected out to Sylvain Distin, whose own shot was saved. The ball fell to McGeady on the left, and with one look up he curled a precision shot to the top right-hand corner, going in net off the post.

Leicester were level within two minutes. Everton failed to deal with Knockaert’ s corner and Ulloa, a summer signing from Brighton, slammed home.

The 28-year-old Argentine forward could make a huge difference to whether Leicester sink or swim this season. Certainly he he proved prolific one level down, scoring 23 league goals in 50 games for Brighton after moving from Ameria in Spain in January last year.

Expectations for Leicester are high, among the ownership group at least, who are quite pleased with themselves for their work in getting their club to the Premier League.

 Chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha had a full-page photograph of himself on yesterday’s match programme cover. There was another one filling page four. And page seven. And page eight. There was also a three-page interview with him where he talked about it being especially fitting for Leicester to return to the Premier League in 2014 as it coincides with the 25th anniversary of the club’s Thai parent company, King Power International.

There, in a snapshot, is the modern Premier League: global commodity, meaning vastly different things to vastly different different.

Srivaddhanaprabha’s son, who is Leicester’s vice-chairman, used his own programme notes to opine: ‘We’re a club that can compete in this league, we have a team that has the potential to achieve great things.’

It would be more prudent to have survival as a first priority, although that will become apparent as the season wears on. A tough start continues with league games next at Chelsea, against Arsenal, at Stoke and against Manchester United.

Everton took the lead just before the interval, after threatening again via Stone and McGeady and being thwarted by lack of a finish from Romelu Lukaku. Steven Pienaar’s scuffed shot ended up with Naismith, who his a left-footed rising shot from 12 yards.

Ulloa missed a header in the 54th half, wide, to spurn the host’s best chance to that point of getting back into this but then substitute Jeff Schlupp blazed over with a comic mis-hit to put that in perspective. 

The lively Riyad Mahrez had put Schlupp through and might have elicited a red card later from Gareth Barry for a tough block but referee Mike Jones did not hand out the second yellow necessary.

With four minutes left, Wood picked up a loose ball after a Mahrez run and rushed forward to net. The KP went nuts.
