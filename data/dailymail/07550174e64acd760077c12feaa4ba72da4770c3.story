A teenage girl who was almost struck by an oncoming subway train has been reunited with the hero who rescued her by pulling her from the tracks moments before the impending collision.

Josh Garcia, a New York University food service employee and father-of-three, bravely jumped onto the Union Square station tracks back in May after Stephanie Xue, a Bronx high school senior, fell off the platform.

And last weekend, the 16-year-old got to say thanks to the good Samaritan, and there were hugs and tears all around.

'They just kept saying, "Thank you, thank you,"' Garcia said of Xue and her parents in an interview with DNAInfo.

Last week, Xue's mother contacted Garcia and invited him to lunch so their family could show their appreciation.

Garcia told the news website that the teen's mother nearly broke down, telling him: 'If it were not for you, this could have been horrible.'

But the humble hero told the woman, 'The only thing that is important is Stephanie is alive and well, and we should just be thankful for that.'

Garcia noticed Xue become dizzy at around 6.45 p.m. on May 7 on the northbound Lexington Avenue line platform and then plunge headfirst onto the tracks.

She hit her head so hard on a rail the noise sounded like a gunshot, he told DNAInfo.

Hundreds of commuters looked on but did nothing to help the wounded teen, but Garcia didn't hesitate.

He pushed through the crowd and jumped down onto the tracks as bright lights emerged from the tunnel signalling an arriving train.

But Garcia acted quickly, scooping up the 5-feet-4 inch Xue and putting her on the platform before hoisting himself to safety.

He
 stayed with the teen, and was helped by Justine Omilig, a 23-year-old 
nursing student, until paramedics arrived and rushed her to Bellevue 
Hospital.

Two months later, Xue is still recovering from the 6-inch-deep head injury she suffered in the fall, though she's doing well.

Describing the incident at the time, Garcia said: 'She was 
leaning over the platform like she was woozy from medication, and then I
 saw her fall and I was like, "Oh s**t!."'

Although
 he was about 50 feet from Xue, Garcia pushed through the apathetic 
crowd and without hesitating, jumped onto the tracks to rescue the girl,
 whose body was lying diagonally across the tracks.

Garcia hoisted the petite five-foot four-inch teen above his head.

'You could see her skull,' Garcia told DNA Info of her wound. 'It was terrifying to look at.'

Even more upsetting, Garcia said, were the reactions of his fellow commuters.

As he attempted to deposit Xue safely
 on the platform, he looked up to see that most people on the platform 
were either taking videos or pictures of the incident with their cell 
phones.

'It was amazing seeing all these people doing nothing,' he said. 'It was an eye-opener.'

Thankfully, Omilig ran over and helped stem the bleed from Xue's head would with a wad of tissues.

Together, Garcia and Omilig kept the terrified teenager conscious and talking until an ambulance arrived.

Doctors at Bellevue Hospital needed 50 stitches to close the gash on Xue's head.

She can't remember much about the ordeal.

'I remember I started to feel dizzy and I just blacked out, and then I woke up and Joshua was helping support my neck and this woman was applying pressure to my wound,' Xue told DNA Info back in May.

She said she was deeply grateful to Garcia for his actions that day when she was in need.

'There is a lot I want to say, but it is hard to find the words,' Xue said. 'I am just so thankful he was there to help me.'

For his part, Garcia refused to acknowledge there was anything heroic about his rescue.

'I give all the glory to Lord Jesus,' Garcia told DNA Info. 'I was glad to help and to show her that there are good people out there.'
