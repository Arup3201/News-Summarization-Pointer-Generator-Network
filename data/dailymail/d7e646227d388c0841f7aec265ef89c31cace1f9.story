Buildings were bathed in an eerie red-orange glow as the worst sandstorm in decades swept across northwest China on Wednesday.

The sandstorm - which according to records is the strongest since 1996 - is believed to have swept in from the Gobi desert in the early afternoon before hitting Dunhuang County.

Schools and businesses were closed as the storm made its way across neighbouring counties Guazhou, Subei, Yumen and Jinta counties, which also issued sandstorm red alerts.

'Suddenly it became dark and I can't tell whether it's day or night,' said one resident. 'My nose hurts and I can't open my eyes,' another said.

The Jiuquan City Meteorological Centre issued a sandstorm red alert, the highest level alert, and visibility was reduced to less than 20 metres in some areas.
