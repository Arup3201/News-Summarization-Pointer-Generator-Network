Standing in a warm shower for a few minutes in the morning can be relaxing and reinvigorating.

And for animals, that's no different.

While most dogs are enthusiastic swimmers, they generally dislike being washed, however, this jovial pooch is a notable exception. 

Powerful: Tsubuan raises his head up as the powerful flow of water gushes down on him

The long-haired dachshund, which lives in Japan, appears to be thoroughly enjoying his doggy shower after his owner arranged for him to have one in the bathroom sink.

The cute dog was named Tsubuan after a Japanese dish consisting of a red bean paste - similar to the colouring of his distinctive red fur.

In the footage, posted online by the unnamed owner, the canine looks happy and satisfied as he enjoys the warm flow of water on his head and back.

The dog raises his head up towards the spray, which gushes down his body.
