Reinvention: The new character, called Kamala Khan, has been introduced by Marvel Comics to reflect the growing diversity of readers

Marvel Comics is reintroducuing Ms. Marvel as a 16-year-old Muslim daughter of Pakistani immigrants.

The character, called Kamala Khan, will live in Jersey City and will form part of Marvel Entertainment's efforts to reflect a growing diversity among its readers.

The reinvented character will be able to grow, shrink and change the shape of her limbs and body.

She is being introduced three years after DC Comics launched a new 'Green Lantern' series with an Arab-American Muslim called Simon Baz.

Marvel Editor-In-Chief Axel Alonso said: 'Kamala is not unlike Peter Parker.

'She's
 a 16-year-old girl from the suburbs who is trying to figure out who she
 is and trying to forge an identity when she suddenly bestows great 
power and learns the great responsibility that comes with it.'

Writer G. Willow Wilson, who converted to Islam while studying at Boston University, and editor Sana Amanat, say Khan's story follows her as she learns to deal with superpowers, family expectations and adolescence.

Amanat calls the series a 'desire to explore the Muslim-American diaspora from an authentic perspective' but is also a representation of what it means to be young and lost amid expectations from others.

He said: 'I wanted Ms. Marvel to be true-to-life, something real people could relate to, particularly young women.

Wilson added: 'High school was a very vivid time in my life, so I drew heavily on those experiences — impending adulthood, dealing with school, emotionally charged friendships that are such a huge part of being a teenager.

History: Marvel became a part of youth culture in the United States with comics like Captain America, which they created in 1941 to capture the patriotic spirit during the Second World War

'It's for all the geek girls out there and everybody else who's ever looked at life from the fringe.'

The idea came after a discussion with senior editor Stephen Wacker as he and Amanat, a Muslim-American, compared stories about their childhoods.

From there it germinated into a 'character for all those little girls who are growing up now the way you are growing up'.

Wilson was brought on board to write the series and the team quickly got approval from Marvel's creative committee to develop the idea.

The team said that Khan's upbringing as a Muslim, is an element of the story, but not the critical foundation, either.

Among its other characters, Marvel Comics also has 
Dust, a young Afghan woman whose mutant ability to manipulate sand and 
dust has been part of the popular X-Men books.

DC Comics also introduced Nightrunner, a young Muslim hero of Algerian descent reared in Paris.

While adapting to the diversity of their readers, the company are also aiming to maintain the attitudes that have been in their publications the since the creation of Spider-Man and the X-Men in the early 1960s.

The first Ms Marvel made her debut in the 1960s and had her own self-titled series before becoming associated with the Avengers and the X-Men.

The character has also been known as Binary, Warbird, and Captain Marvel at various points in the company's history.

In 1977, writer Gerry Conway said, about the character: 'You might see a parallel between her quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness, for self-liberation, for identity.'
