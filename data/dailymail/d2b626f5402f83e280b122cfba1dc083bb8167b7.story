It could be the scene of a particularly gruesome murder.

Or it could just be a trail of water left by a dog that's been paddling in the lake.

But this satellite shot from Google maps
 has sparked online speculation that a nasty crime may have taken place and gone 
undetected in the city of Almere, across the water from Amsterdam in 
Holland.

With what looks like a trail of blood apparently leading from a waterside jetty into a park, it's easy to see why eagle eyed readers might have feared a murder had taken place.

Crime scene? A picture posted on Reddit has sparked speculation that something sinister happened and went undetected in the Dutch city of Almere

The picture appears to show at least one shady figure stood at the end of the jetty.

But if the satellite shot has captured a crime in progress the perpetrator is pretty brazen - it's broad daylight.

The shot was posted on Reddit with the caption 'A murder near my house on Google Maps'.

It's not the first time that unusual images have been spotted on Google Earth.

Earlier this year, Fiona Powell of Bristol came across a ghostly image of a man at a house in a village bulldozed to make way for an airfield in South Gloucestershire.

The village of Charlton had been destroyed in 1946 so that the airfield in Filton - owned by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, which is now BAE Systems - could be extended for the giant Brabazon airliner.

Security guard Jason Cook also claimed to have spotted the Loch Ness monster in satellite images.

He claimed that the 65ft oblong shape followed by thin strands is actually the highly contested creature which is famously said to inhabit the open stretch of water in the Scottish Highlands.

The city of Almere where the latest bizarre Google Earth image was captured is Holland's newest city and home to more than 193,000 people.

The first homes were only completed in 1976.
