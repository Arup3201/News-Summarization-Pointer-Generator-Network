New footage has emerged of the final moments of the suicide bomber who killed 17 people at Volgograd's central station in December last year.

Images from CCTV cameras show the man approaching the station, climbing the steps and walking inside to the metal detectors.

Moments later there's a blinding flash and the screen fills with burning debris.

Meanwhile, a new video has surfaced, threatening the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

The video, posted by group Ansar al Sunah on a militant Chechen site, shows two young men who are believed to have been the bombers in the December 2013 Volgograd attacks, ABC News reported.

It's thought that the group were responsible for the railway station attack on December 29 and the trolley bus bombing the following day that killed 15.

The two men warned that as long as President Vladimir Putin occupies the North Caucasus region near Sochi, Russians and Olympic visitors alike will not be safe.

'We'll have a surprise package for you,' one of the men said in the video, according to the ABC report. 'And those tourists that will come to you, for them, too, we have a surprise. If it happens [the Olympics], we'll have a surprise for you. This is for all the Muslim blood that is shed every day around the world, be it in Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, all around the world. This will be our revenge.'
