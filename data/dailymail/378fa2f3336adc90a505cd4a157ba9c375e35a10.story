Missing 11-year-old Kareem Granton, of East New York, found safe in Manhattan

A missing schoolboy has been found safe after spending five days riding the subway with just $10 in his pocket because he didn't want to clean up after his dog.

Kareem Granton, 11, of East New York, was found Monday morning at the Union Square subway station after a woman spotted him and alerted police.

When he was reunited with his distraught family he revealed that he had left home because he did not want to clean up after his dog, Queenie.

Kareem went missing on Wednesday after he got home from school and went to play video games without permission with a friend.

The pair then went to a nearby Chuck E. Cheese's to eat and Kareem disappeared. 

His frantic family launched an appeal to find the schoolboy who disappeared after having 'a tantrum in the moment.'

He was found on Monday by a woman who spotted him at about 7am and notified the K-9 cop on the platform.

The officer, Dennis Grimm, 36, immediately followed with his dog and boarded the car to get Kareem.

Kareem said he survived on just  $10 which had been given to him by his stepfather and admitted he ran off in anger

After asking the young boy some questions, Mr Grimm took Kareem to McDonald's, and bought him some food and drink.

Kareem told CBS 2 said he survived on just $10 which had been given to him by his stepfather and slept on the subway.

He admitted he ran off in anger: 'I just had a tantrum, a type of anger problem. So I just wanted to express it in a different way.'

Officer, Dennis Grimm, 36, immediately jumped into action, with his dog and boarded the car to get Kareem

Mr Grimm said Kareem told him he went to the mall Wednesday at Barclays Center with a friend, but the two became separated. 

'He got lost and has been on the train since then,' Mr Grimm said. 

Authorities said the boy appeared to be in good physical condition. 

His mother Precious Granton said she was grateful to be reunited with her son, but he would be punished. 

'I was happy. I wanted to be jumping like I won a million dollars,' Granton told CBS 2 of the moment she was reunited with her son.
