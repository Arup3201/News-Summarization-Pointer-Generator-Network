She may still be wearing her diamond wedding ring but the widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died two years ago, may have found love again as she has now been romantically linked to former Washington DC mayor Adrian Fenty.

Laurene Powell Jobs, who was married to the famed tech entrepreneur for 20 years, is said to have bonded with Adrian Fenty over a shared passion for school reform after they met at an education conference in 2011.

Their friendship reportedly developed into a romance shortly after Mr Fenty announced he was leaving his wife, sources told the Washington Post.

New love: Laurene Powell Jobs has been romantically linked to former Washington DC mayor Adrian Fenty

Tender moment: Steve Jobs met Laurene Powell when she was a grad student at Stanford, and they married two years later in 1991. They were said to have had 'an exceptionally close marriage' (seen here in 2011, months before his death)

Political family: Fenty- seen holding his daughter Aerin while the couple's twin sons Matthew and Andrew stand behind Michelle on the local Election Day in 2010- has not yet had his divorce finalized

The couple's relationship is not believed to have been behind the break up of Mr Fenty's 15-year marriage.

Mrs Jobs, who has three children, inherited an estate of about $10billion when her husband died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 56 in October 2011.

Despite being one of the richest women in the U.S, the 49-year-old has kept a deliberately low profile as she continues with her charitable work.

In a rare interview in April Mrs Jobs said of her husband: 'His private legacy with me and the kids is that of husband and father. And we miss him every day.'

Grieving: Laurene with her husband and Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011

As she pushes her charity work, Mrs 
Jobs has started to increase her public profile, and friends suggest 
that it is time that she starts to make a name for herself that is 
removed from her husband's legacy.

'She’s been mourning for a year and was grieving for five years before that,' said Larry Brilliant, of Skoll Global Threats Fund, told the New York Times earlier this year.

'Her
life was about her family and Steve, but she is now emerging as a 
potent force on the world stage, and this is only the beginning.'

She married the Apple founder two years after meeting him when Jobs gave a talk to Stanford Business School while she was a student there.

His half sister, Mona Simpson, took a moment during his eulogy to reflect on her late brother's love of Laurene, telling how he called her on the day that he first met his future wife.

One with nature: Steve and Laurene got married at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite Valley in March 1991, and their first child, a son named Reed, was born six months later

Spiritual: Their wedding ceremony was led by a Zen Buddhist monk, Kobun Chino Otogawa, in keeping with Jobs' religious beliefs

Tough times: Laurene and Steve were married for 20 years, though friends said how she was grieving for the final few as he grew more and more sick (seen here together in 2011 months before he died)

'There’s this beautiful woman and she’s really smart and she has this dog and I’m going to marry her,' he reportedly said on that fateful day.

'His abiding love for Laurene sustained him. He believed that love happened all the time, everywhere,' Simpson said.

Their wedding took place in March 1991 at a hotel in Yosemite Valley, and the ceremony was led by a Zen Buddhist monk, Kobun Chino Otogawa, in keeping with Jobs' religious beliefs.

Their eldest child, a son named Reed, was born six months later, and the couple had two daughters in the years following.

Separation: Adrian and Michelle Fenty's 15-year-marriage is said to have ended in January

During Steve's lifetime, Laurene kept her profile extremely low, focusing on raising their three children and running their home while her husband, an infamous workaholic, launched the groundbreaking tech firm.

While she was on the boards of several companies and charities during his lifetime, it was only after he died that she began to speak publicly and use her fame to draw attention to the causes that matter to her- education reform and school accessibility for the children of immigrants being the two biggest passion projects.

Her connection to Mr Fenty increased after he joined the board of College Track, a non-profit program for students that she founded in February last year.

In a statement released at the time she said: 'Adrian Fenty is one of our country’s 
great advocates for education reform. His sense of urgency and record of accomplishment is 
unparalleled.'

In contrast to the privacy courted by Mrs Jobs, Mr Fenty has been a public figure since his election as Washington DC mayor in 2006.

He and his wife Michelle, who have twin teenage sons and a young daughter, were often spotted at high profile parties and events in the city. 

When he was elected to run the nation's capitol, a number of glowing profiles mention his athletic build, with The Washingtonian describing the now-42-year-old as 'an attractive, unstoppable political force, a buff triathlete, a proud father of three, the local mirror image of President Barack Obama'.

Separate lives: Michelle, a lawyer, began spending much of her time in Trinidad and Tobago for work last year

Since his defeat in 2010 Mr Fenty has focused on acting as a consultant to education tech companies and his position as special adviser at Andreessen Horowitz, which led to him splitting his time between Washington and Silicon Valley.

His wife took a job in Trinidad and Tobago with the Inter-American Development Bank in 2012, which led to her also splitting her life between two places, according to the Washington Post.

On January 14 of this year, the couple announced that they were separating and their divorce is said to be close to completion but formally done.

Both Mrs Jobs and Mr Fenty have declined to comment on speculation about their relationship.
