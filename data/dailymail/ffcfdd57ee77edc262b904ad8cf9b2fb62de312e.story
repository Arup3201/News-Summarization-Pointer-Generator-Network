Respite: Motorists in rural areas could be set to benefit from a Government subsidy

Cutting fuel duty for drivers in rural areas could lead to a postcode lottery, ministers were warned yesterday.

Isolated areas of Devon, Cornwall, Herefordshire, North Yorkshire and Wales are among those earmarked to benefit from a 5p discount on their fuel.

The scheme, which already operates in the Scottish islands and Scilly Isles, reflects the increased costs of transporting fuel to remote areas for a small number of people.

But trying to extend it to mainland Britain by drawing lines around certain rural areas will be ‘very  difficult’, AA president Edmund King warned.

He said: ‘On an island you have no other choice of where to buy petrol so there is not a postcode lottery, but this will mean garages on the other side of the B259 (for example) from the designated zone may go out of business. It will be difficult to set up.’

Ministers plan to cut fuel duty for garages in remote areas from 53p to 48p a litre in the hope they will pass the saving on to their customers and help boost the rural economy.

The Treasury has said rural petrol stations can apply for the rebate if they have to charge more than 139p per litre for unleaded fuel and 145.5p for diesel.

However Mr King said drivers in cut-off areas of Suffolk, Norfolk and Pembrokeshire had already contacted him to complain that their areas were unlikely to meet the threshold.

He added: ‘It is certainly welcome for people in these areas, and it is a fact that if you are a garage in a rural area and you get fewer customers then you have to charge more. But you get 5p price disparities along one section of the M4 just outside London.

Variation: People living in rural areas typically pay more for their fuel than those who live in towns

‘It would be better if the pricing was more transparent.

‘And we would like to see the Government publish wholesale prices as they do in other countries.’

A fuel duty cut for some areas is defined as state aid, so the Government needs to persuade the European Commission it will not breach state competition laws.

Rebates have been granted in other islands, including Corsica and some Spanish and Portuguese islands, but offering it to certain areas on the mainland is more complicated.

Determined: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (left) says he will do everything he can to 'make this happen', but AA president Edmund King (right) warned it would be 'very difficult' to extend the scheme

The current rebate scheme currently allows petrol stations in the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, the Islands of the Clyde and the Scillies to claim back 5p per litre relief on fuel.

The Government will collect fuel prices from 1,500 retailers in 36 remote areas over the next five weeks before applying to the Commission in the autumn.

The cost of the new scheme looks set to run to millions of pounds.

Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘The island fuel rebate provides much-needed help to keep down fuel prices in areas where costs of transporting fuel mean prices are much higher.

‘We will need to prove that there are areas which are similar to the islands in terms of pump prices and distribution costs, so I would urge local areas that may qualify to provide the information we need to make the case as robust as possible.

‘As a Highlander, I know that for people who live in rural areas driving is not a choice, but a necessity. So while it won’t be easy to get this agreed with the Commission, I want to do everything I can to make this happen.’
