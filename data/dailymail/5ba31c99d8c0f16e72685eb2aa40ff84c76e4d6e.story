Marine wife Brittany Killgore pleaded for help in the last text message she sent before she was murdered by her date, Louis Ray Perez, prosecutors revealed Thursday.

In Perez's car, Police found the 22-year-old woman's blood and a weapon. The 45-year-old Marine Staff Sergent pleaded not guilty to murdering Killgore, whose naked body was found April 17 near a lake outside San Diego, California.

Perez and his girlfriend were soliciting 'sex slaves' on a bondage website before the Killgore disappeared, though authorities have not publicly commented on whether their kinky lifestyle played a role in the murder.

Killgore had a date with Perez and another woman planned for April 13. However, the other woman never showed up, said Patrick Espinoza, a San Diego County prosecutor.

'She sent a text saying, "Help,"' Espinoza said about Killgore.

'She was missing from that point on.'

Perez told investigators he dropped 
off Killgore in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp District, but he actually 
stayed in Fallbrook, about 60 miles north, authorities said.

Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, has already been charged with the murder after she was found at a San Diego motel room with a 
suicide note detailing what happened to Killgore. Lopez had multiple 
stabbed herself multiple times, but none of the injuries were 
life-threatening.

Lopez lived with Perez's girlfriend 
in Fallbrook, near Camp Pendleton, the Marine base where both Perez and 
Killgore's husband were stationed.

Killgore died less than a week after 
filing for divorce from Lance Cpl Cory Killgore, a Marine who was in 
Afghanistan when she disappeared. She cited irreconcilable differences 
in her divorce filing, which gave no other details.

The couple, who married in 2010, also lived in Fallbrook.

Perez was already in jail after he 
allegedly stole an assault rifle and a motorcycle from the Marine base. 
Prosecutors did not say what kind of weapon police found in his car.

Perez's attorney, Jeff Reichert, said 
the suicide note clearly shows that Lopez killed Killgore and that his 
client was not involved. Superior Court Judge Kimberlee Lagotta ordered 
the note to be sealed.

Perez has been in the military for 16 years, has no criminal history, is married and has lived in the San Diego area for about 10 years, Reichert said in court last week.

Perez made posts on the website BMEHookups.com about wanting to find another 'sex slave' to join his home.

The families of both Killgore and Lopez vehemently deny that the two were linked with Perez's sex ring. Prosecutors have offered no possible motive in the killings.

However, in a posting on another BDSM website, TSRnetwork.com, Perez's girlfriend wrote: 'We have a poly home in which I own two slave girls. Life is good,' the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

Poly refers to 'polyamorous,' an alternative 'open' relationship with multiple sexual partners.

On BME Hookups, a website devoted to matching connecting people with kinky sex fetishes, Perez, who used the online alias 'Ivan' wrote: 'I am lord and master, dom and daddy of my house. My slave, Ms. Dee, is a slave to no one, but myself.'

His 36-year-old girlfriend described herself as 'an alpha slave to master Ivan.'

Perez posted several photos of himself and his girlfriend on the website and said he was looking for another woman to join his home.

Mrs Killgore, it was revealed, maintained a blog years ago where she wrote about fears about marriage and divorce.

In the blog titled 13smyfavoritenumber, Killgore, whose nude body was discovered on Tuesday, wrote about her insecurities and how she suffered from depression, according to NBC San Diego.

‘im so insecure sometimes its not even funny (sic),’ she wrote aged 17, adding that she had recently stopped taking anti-depressants.

She also told how she was worried 
about getting married because of the high divorce rates.

When responding to a question about 
whether she wanted to get married, Killgore wrote in 2007: ‘i want to 
be, but … i want to love that person. the divorce rate is so high its 
sad.’

In other postings, Killgore revealed 
she did not get on with her family and was looking forward to moving out
and going to college.

‘im planning to move out its very 
difficult. i dont get along with my family all that well i think it will
be better when i move out. my sister and i have gotten closer though, 
its actully realy weird,’ she said

However, Lopez's neighbor claims she and Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex ring, playing sex slaves.

Lopez's
attorney Dean Broyles said he didn't know if his client knew Perez or 
Mrs Killgore, who was reported missing Saturday -- one day after Lopez 
turned 25.

'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said.

'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.'

Mr
Broyles said Lopez would ask the judge for a public defender after her 
family sought his help in fielding media questions. Lopez's parents, who
live in nearby Escondido, released a statement saying they loved their 
daughter.

'We pray for the 
family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort them during 
their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said. 'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.'

Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected.

A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring, saying: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.'
