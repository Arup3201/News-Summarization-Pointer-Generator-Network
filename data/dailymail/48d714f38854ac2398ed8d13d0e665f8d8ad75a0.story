Costly: Greater Manchester fire service managers' navy blue shirts have been replaced by white ones, pictured, to distinguish them from firefighters - at a cost of nearly £13,000 to the taxpayer

The fire brigade has splashed out £13,000 on white shirts for bosses - so they look different to blue-shirted firefighters.

Some 475 managers at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service have had their traditional navy blue shirts replaced by white ones to help distinguish themselves from the firefighters.

Bosses say the change will help the public recognise a senior officer but the move has been labelled a ‘vanity project’ by firefighters, while union leaders say it is an ‘unnecessary extravagance’.

Crew managers, watch managers and borough commanders posted at stations and bosses at the brigade’s Swinton HQ will have to wear the new shirts to make them stand out from their colleagues.

Their five blue collared shirts and five blue t-shirts, which are worn underneath, have been taken away and replaced with five white collared shirts and five white t-shirts at a cost of £12,668 to the taxpayer.

Bosses
claim the cost of the total new white kit is from an existing budget 
and actually comes in £1,300 cheaper than the blue equivalent.

Assistant
Chief Fire Officer Paul Argyle said: 'Fire stations belong to the 
community and are proving their value to Greater Manchester more than 
ever by being a hub for many groups and activities.

'Since
stations became much more open and home to larger numbers of local 
groups, we realised people need to be able to identify who is in charge -
and we want it to be just as easy to spot who is in charge when crews 
are out working in the community, which is now how they spend the 
majority of their shifts. So this helps that too.

'The
shirts have been brought in through a staged approach. The unused blue 
shirts that are returned to stores will be reused and issued to 
firefighters when they next need them.

'The
new white ones are more cost effective long term. Other North West fire
and rescue services have already adopted this uniform for managers.'

But the move has been criticised by firefighters who believe the money could be better spent elsewhere.

One officer, who didn't want to be named, said: 'It’s just a vanity project and a waste of money. Crew managers and watch managers still go out jobs and a white shirt is just going to be impractical. They get stuck in as much as anyone else. They’ll just end up in the bin.'

Another added: 'It’s a ridiculous waste of taxpayers’ money that appears to come about on a whim. Senior firefighters can already be recognised because they wear white helmets. It doesn’t make sense.'

Gary Keary, secretary of the Manchester Fire Brigades Union, said: 'At a time when firefighters positions are being lost, this looks like an unnecessary extravagance.'

Last year fire service bosses warned that further cuts to funding could lead to the closure of fire stations and compulsory redundancies. The authority has lost 300 uniformed posts and 100 support roles since implementing budget cuts in 2011.
