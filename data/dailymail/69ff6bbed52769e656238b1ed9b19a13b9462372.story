Vets have been left baffled after a lost Spanish cat was found wandering in the Midlands - 1,500 miles from his home.

The cat, which vets have renamed Dribbler, was brought in as a stray by a woman who found him looking thin and hungry in her garden in Lichfield, Staffordshire - but a microchip revealed he was registered in Spain.

Vets still have no idea how the intrepid cat was able to make his trip across Spain, France and the English channel - a journey which would take 24 hours to drive.

A perfect mystery: Vets in Lichfield have no idea how Dribbler managed to make his way across Spain, France and the English Channel - a journey which would take 24 hours to drive

Feeling better: The woman who found Dribbler said that he looked thin and hungry when she saw him in her garden in Lichfield Staffordshire. He is now fit and healthy again after a month of care

The black-and-white cat, which always drools slightly, was taken to Pool House Veterinary Surgery in Lichfield, where a scan of his microchip revealed that he had come from Spain, though vets were unable to trace an exact address.

Emma Wood, a nurse at the practice, said: 'We have absolutely no idea how Dribbler got to England.

'He was dropped off by a member of the public who found him in their garden and said he looked a bit thin.

'We've checked his microchip which is registered in Spain but there is no way of knowing who he belongs to.

'He's got a blue velvet collar on but there are no contact details on there either.'

The cat, believed to be 10 years old, has
 been given his new name as an old jaw injury means he can't stop 
dribbling when it comes close to mealtimes.Â 

Plenty of cuddles: Veterinary nurse Emma Wood, pictured left with veterinary surgeon Katie Dow,  said that Dribbler is still a 'really friendly feline' - even after his 1,500-mile trip from his home in Spain

Ready to eat: An old jaw injury means that Dribbler's mouth hangs open slightly and leaves him with a little patch of drool on his chin - especially when he gets hungry before mealtimes

It is thought that it was injured in a car accident that left it with a 
fractured jaw which vets believe was never properly treated.

Despite the injury, the intrepid cat hasn't been put off his food and is now back to full health after being cared for almost a month.

Ms Wood said: 'He doesn't seem to be in pain with his mouth. He still eats a lot and it is quite cute when he gets excited before meal times and starts drooling.

'After all he's been through, he's still a really friendly feline. All he wants is cuddles.'
