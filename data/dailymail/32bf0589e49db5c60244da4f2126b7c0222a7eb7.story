Raheem Sterling is reportedly attracting attention from the likes of Bayern Munich and Real Madrid despite being without a goal in 17 games for Liverpool.

The 20-year-old hasn't found the net for club or country since Liverpool's 3-1 defeat against West Ham in September - not a great stat when he looks to be angling for a new deal at Anfield.

After a 10-goal haul last season as Brendan Rodgers' side came second in the Premier League, Sterling has struggled to make an impact this term.

Raheem Sterling should be concentrating on his performances, not a new contract, claims Phil Neville

Sterling also found himself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons at the weekend after missing Liverpool's best chances in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United.

His recent performances have attracted strong opinion from former United defender Phil Neville, who believes Sterling must start proving himself if he is to earn a new deal.

Liverpool are trying to tie the England forward to a new long-term contract and can ill-afford to lose their next potential world-class star, but Neville insists the player must concentrate on his job.

Neville told BBC 5 Live: 'If I was Brendan Rodgers, I would be sitting Raheem Sterling down today.

'It’s a great lesson for younger players: I keep reading about how Raheem Sterling wants a new contract, maybe Real Madrid want to buy him.

'If you want a new contract, and you want to go to Real Madrid, the best way to get that move or that contract is to go out and score a hat-trick at Old Trafford, like he should have done on Sunday. 

Sterling has been attracting interest from Bundesliga champions and Champions League favourites Bayern

Phil Neville has criticised Sterling, saying the player should focus on his performances on the pitch

'I keep saying I think Raheem Sterling is a brilliant talent, a wonderful player, but I think he needs to sit down with his agent and say, You do your job on the contract, I'll do my job on the field" because in football, it's on the field where you've got to start doing your job.'

Rodgers remains relaxed about Sterling's future despite reported interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs.

The Liverpool boss said on Tuesday: 'He is a real talisman for this team. He has been a great example of the progress that a lot of the players have made here.

'He has gone from a youth team player to one of the top young players in European football.

'The club, I am sure, will work very hard (on his contract) and Raheem is happy here, he loves being a Liverpool player.'
