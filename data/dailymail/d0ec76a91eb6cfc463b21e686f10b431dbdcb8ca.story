Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain has warned Barcelona that the Premier League champions 'have plenty of confidence' ahead of a repeat of the Champions League fixture that eliminated Manuel Pellegrini's side from the tournament at the same stage last season.

After a home defeat to CSKA Moscow in November, City were at the bottom of Group E and struggling to see a way of progressing in Europe's most illustrious club competition.

But a hat-trick from Sergio Aguero inspired City to a 3-2 win against Bayern Munich and they followed it with a 2-0 victory at the Stadio Olimpico against Roma  to advance to the second round, where they meet Barcelona again.

But Begiristain believes that the character City showed to reach the knock-out stages ensures that belief is high and Barcelona will have a harder proposition than last season.

'We have plenty of confidence with the way we qualified beating Bayern Munich at home and Roma away, so the players will be working hard to get fit and arrive in confidence for those games,' Begiristain told Sky Sports.

'We have really improved our squad and feel we are more solid, stronger than last season.

'We have the same quality up front, but are more solid behind, and that gives us confidence for the run.'

Barcelona were 4-1 aggregate winners against City last season, following up a 2-0 victory at the Nou Camp with a 2-1 win at the Etihad. 

Begiristain also commented on how City continue to draw the same teams from previous years of involvement in the tournament, after Pellegrini's side also took on Bayern Munich and CSKA for the second time in as many years in the group stages.

'It’s unbelievable – we don’t need to come next year,' he joked.

'Every tie in that draw is the same, it's fantastic, so we're looking forward to it.'

Pellegrini will be hoping City's upward trajectory in European form will continue when they play Barcelona at home in the first leg on February 24, with the away fixture taking place on March 18.
