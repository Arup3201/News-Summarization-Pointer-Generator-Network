It’s quite understandable that the European Tour and other parties with a vested interest should promote Darren Clarke versus Miguel Angel Jimenez for the Ryder Cup captaincy as some kind of heavyweight clash of equals.

But there’s no reason the rest of us need fall for it.

Quite frankly, when the newly-formed five-man committee meet on Wednesday to decide this important matter, they either give the nod to Clarke or they make themselves look ridiculous.

Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez are battling it out to be European captain

Yes, the Spaniard is a wonderful character and it is amazing he’s still competitive on tour at 51. But the idea he could leapfrog Clarke for a post considered the pinnacle of a player’s career should offend anyone who has followed closely the fortunes of the European game these past 20 years.

Haven’t we had too many captains born in the UK and isn’t this a chance to recognise the enormous contribution made by mainland Europe?

Well, it’s an argument. But forgive me if I stick to the idea that the best candidate should get the nod, regardless of where they were born, and Clarke is plainly the best. The most important consideration has to be the views of the players who are likely to make up the next team.

By my calculations, eight who were at Gleneagles last time have said it should go to Clarke, with four undeclared. Are the committee really going to go against the wishes of such men as Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell?

Public relations has become a massive part of the job and it is hard to see how Jimenez would cope, on several levels.

It would be wrong if his fractured English precluded him, but a long-held disinclination to do interviews that don’t suit him ought to be taken into account. Clarke is no angel in this regard, either. He’s had his mad moments; indeed there have been plenty of things he’d probably do differently if he had the chance.

But he’s bursting with pride merely at the thought of getting this job, and would cope far better with all the unspoken demands.

In terms of playing records, there is no comparison. Clarke has won an Open and two World Golf Championship events, achievements that Jimenez cannot get near.

That might not matter anymore, given Paul McGinley’s stellar captaincy last time. Like Jimenez, he had not won a major or any of the WGCs.

Paul McGinley pushed all the right buttons as Europe sailed to victory over the USA in 2014

But Ryder Cup records have to be part of the equation — and here there is no comparison, either. Jimenez’s record is poor, with 5.5 points gained from 15 matches for a win percentage of just 37 per cent. Clarke’s win percentage is 58 per cent from 20 matches played.

There are few men who can better that percentage in the long history of the contest but two of them will decide his fate tomorrow morning — Colin Montgomerie, captain in 2010, and Jose Maria Olazabal, who was skipper in 2012.

Alongside McGinley, David Howell (representing the tournament players’ committee) and outgoing chief executive George O’Grady, they will surely pick the man whose outstanding contribution to European golf deserves the ultimate accolade.

It has to be Clarke.

Dustin Johnson to give Rory McIlroy a run for his money at the Masters

We’ve reached that period in the season when all eyes turn to America and we’re looking for runners and riders who might upset the favourite Rory McIlroy when the Masters comes around in April.

We’ve seen Tiger Woods fall at the first fence. We’ve seen Phil Mickelson pull up lame. And, on the unrivalled Monterey Peninsula in California last week, we saw three gifted performers lengthen their stride to illustrate their legitimate claims.

American Dustin Johnson impressed on his return from six-month leave of absence

There was Australian Jason Day, now blessedly injury-free and following up his win the previous week with a top-seven finish; America’s best young golfer Jordan Spieth, who went so close on his Masters debut last time, putting together four rounds in the sixties to demonstrate fame and fortune will not distract him.

And finally there was Dustin Johnson, back from his six-month leave of absence with rounds of 69, 67, 68, 66 and vowing to put his party lifestyle behind him. 

Rory McIlroy aims to build on his two major wins in 2014 and complete a career grand slam at April's Masters 

Like McIlroy and Bubba Watson, the huge-hitting Johnson should look upon Augusta as a venue where he has been bequeathed an enormous advantage. You might want to get a cheeky pound or two on him now, because my guess is his price will fall dramatically over the next seven weeks.

He looks a man hell-bent on redemption.
