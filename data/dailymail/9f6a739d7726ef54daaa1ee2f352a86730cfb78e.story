A Chinese zoo has been accused of cruelty after forcing a lion into a tiny cage, tying it down and using an angle grinder to cut off its claws.

Staff at the zoo in Zhumadian city in central China's Henan province also admitted that they perform the 'pedicure' without using any  anaesthetics, or consulting a vet.

Images show 13-year-old male lion Xiuxiu being tied down with ropes while four staff hold it in place during the procedure.

The  manager has defended the treatment of Xiuxiu, saying that he was the only large cat out of the zoo's ten  tigers and five lions that undergoes the angle grinder 'pedicure'.

Manager Zhao Yanmei said that while the other big cats regularly stretched and sharpen their claws, Xiuxiu spends all his time lying around meaning that his claws quickly grow too long.

However, local animal rights activist Yan Yan Liu, 37, has accused the zoo of wanting to save money. 

She said: 'Only in China it is operation carried out by this, anywhere else in the world the zoo would pay a vet to give the animal an anaesthetic, making sure that it was a stress free procedure. 

'And they would use a proper tool to trim the claws, instead of mutilating them with something inappropriate like grinder because they needed to get it done quickly.'

The zoo however defended its decision to do away with the vets and said the angle grinder treatment is quick and painless.

Ms Zhao added: 'We decided years ago not to bother with anaesthetics for any of our lions, tigers or other big cats because we found that it tends to make them feel ill afterwards. 

'We do it like this to avoid any side effects.'

'Our way is quick and painless and takes about a minute to do each claw, after which disinfectant is applied.'

If a big cat's claws are not trimmed, Ms Zhao said, they grow inwards and cause pain, swelling and infection.
