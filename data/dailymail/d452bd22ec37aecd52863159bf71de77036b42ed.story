Employment tribunal: James Bagshawe claims he lost his position as chief operating officer at Gatehouse Bank because he wasn't Muslim

A British banker claims he lost his £185,000-a-year job with a Kuwaiti-owned investment bank because he wasn’t a Muslim.

James Bagshawe, 53, was the Chief Operating Officer of the Gatehouse Bank when he was suddenly made redundant while on holiday in August 2011.

He claims he was replaced by the less experienced Twalha Dhunno, who was a Muslim.Mr Bagshawe, from Gravesend, Kent, who was a founding member of the bank, said: ‘I feel that I have been badly treated by Gatehouse and its Board.

'I was a founding member of the executive team when Gatehouse was set up and for over four years I committed a great deal of time and energy to trying to make it succeed.

‘The manner of my dismissal on holiday can only be described as an unnecessary and vindictive, and it leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.’

At an Employment Tribunal in London yesterday Mr Bagshawe, from Kent, admitted the bank had struggled as a result of the credit crunch and staff had been laid off.

Despite Gatehouse never making a profit during the four years he spent at the bank Mr Bagshawe was paid more than £1m in salary and bonuses over the period.

The bank operated under Sharia law, which has strict rules over issues such as charging interest on loans.

He claimed his relationship with his bosses began to turn sour when he raised concerns about a proposed £100m investment from the Kuwaiti Investment Agency (KIA).

He said the deal was done by the bank’s chairman, Fahed Boodai, and Mr Dhunnoo who was at the time his junior. He claimed he and other UK-based executives were kept in the dark about what was going on.

'Race discrimination': Investment banker Mr Bagshawe claims a Muslim employee took over his role at Gatehouse Bank after he was made redundant

He claims he raised concerns about the deal with the Financial Standards Authority which made him unpopular with the bank.

Mr Bagshawe said: ‘I do not make an allegation of discrimination lightly.

‘However the fact remains that Mr 
Boodai, as a Muslim, chose to involve Mr Dhunnoo, another Muslim, in the
 KIA investment, to the exclusion of his UK based executive team, none 
of whom are Muslim.’

Mr Bagshawe who has 25 years of 
experience in banking working for JP Morgan and Flemings, is claiming to
 be whistleblower and so can be awarded unlimited damages if he wins the
 case.

He claims Mr Dhunnoo should also have been considered for redundancy.

Mr Bagshawe said: ‘Based on my 
assessment of our respective experience and skills I did not see there 
was any rational reason for the difference in treatment.

‘I remain of the view that my race, 
nationality, ethnic background or religion or belief may have been a 
factor in my dismissal, and do not believe that Gatehouse has provided 
any evidence to rebut this view.’

Gatehouse Bank deny the allegations 
and say Mr Bagshawe’s position remains redundant a year after he left 
the company and there are no proposals to appoint a successor.

It also claims the FSA did not 
recognise his approach to them as ‘whistleblowing’ and that Mr Bagshawe 
had agreed the KIA investment at a board meeting.

They also say there is no evidence that Mr Bagshawe has been discriminated against because of his race or religion.

The tribunal continues and is expected to last 12 days.

Last night a spokesman for the bank 
said: ‘Mr Bagshawe was made redundant by the CEO a Christian. His appeal
 was heard by a non-executive director, another Christian. His 
redundancy was supported by the Board comprised equally of Christians 
and Muslims.

‘The Bank categorically denies that 
there was any relationship whatsoever between Mr Bagshawe’s religion and
 the decision to make him redundant.

‘As COO, Mr Bagshawe was well paid 
during his 4 year term, earning in excess of £1million. Yet by December 
2010, during his tenure, the company was eroding £1million per month of 
its working capital.

‘The company all but halved its 
headcount from 40 in November 2009 to 25 in June 2011. Nonetheless, Mr 
Bagshawe received an enhanced redundancy package and pay in lieu of 
notice in compensation for his loss of office, equivalent to double the 
average Londoner’s annual salary.

‘He was also entitled to keep over a third of a million shares.

‘Gatehouse Bank had, and has, a 
diverse workforce including individuals who hold the Christian, Muslim 
and Hindu faiths, among others. Claims that Mr Bagshawe has been 
discriminated against or that he “blew the whistle” are strongly 
contested.’
