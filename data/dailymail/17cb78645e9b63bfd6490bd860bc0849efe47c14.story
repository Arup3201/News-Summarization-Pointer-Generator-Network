Pets might soon be able to use pot under a bill introduced on Tuesday in the Nevada Legislature.

Democratic Senator Tick Segerblom is sponsoring the measure that would allow animal owners to get marijuana for their pet if a veterinarian certifies the animal has an illness that might be alleviated by the drug.

Segerblom said he's concerned that some animals might have adverse reactions, but 'you don't know until you try,' he said.

Pot for pets: Companion Cannabis, by Holistic Therapeutics, a Marijuana medicinal tincture for dogs and cats is displayed at La Brea Compassionate Caregivers, a medical marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles

Some veterinarians who have given cannabis to sick and dying pets say it has relieved their symptoms, although the substance hasn't been proven as a painkiller for animals.

Los Angeles veterinarian Doug Kramer told The Associated Press in 2013 that pot helped ease his Siberian husky's pain during her final weeks, after she had surgery to remove tumors. 

Kramer said cannabis helped his dog, Nikita, gain weight and live an extra six weeks before she was euthanized.

'I grew tired of euthanizing pets when I wasn't doing everything I could to make their lives better,' Kramer told the AP. 

'I felt like I was letting them down.'

The proposal is in its earliest stages and faces several legislative hurdles before it could become law.

The pot-for-pets provision of SB372 is part of a larger bill that would overhaul the state's medical marijuana law, removing penalties for drivers who have marijuana in their blood and requiring training for pot-shop owners.

Segerblom said he added the provision after being approached by a constituent.

Senator Mark Manendo, a fellow Democrat and animal rights advocate, said he hadn't heard of the practice of giving marijuana to animals and is concerned about its safety.

'That gives me pause,' he said. 'Alcohol is bad, chocolate is bad for dogs.'

His own dog died in his arms at age 15, and the experience was difficult and emotional, he said.

But 'I don't know if I would've given him marijuana,' Manendo said.

According to the website for Canna Companion,one of several existing marijuana supplement companies for pets, the drug is able to help pets with joint pain, anxiety, digestive issues, end of life care, neurological function, and immune system function. 

Dr. Sara Brandon ans Licensed Veterinarian Lisa Anderson turned to medical marijuana after traditional medicine failed to help their own pain and health issues and they turned to hemp supplements.

Canna Companion is not intended for human digestion but rather is a hemp supplement infused with other vitamins they say they've successfully used to treat animals

One of those pets is Kaley the cat who once suffered from Arthritis and who now is in much less pain, says the company.

Only time will tell how medical marijuana affects pets as the substance hasn't been officially proven to cure or alleviate symptoms of any disease.
