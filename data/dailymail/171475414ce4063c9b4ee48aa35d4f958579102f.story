The Moroccan-born woman, who holds Spanish nationality, has a police record for child neglect and not 
reporting a runaway child, French radio reported.

'When I arrived on the scene, they were 
still trying to revive her. She was in cardiac arrest,' said the 
prosecutor, who said Ms Calmesdied of her wounds soon afterwards.

Benoit Hamon, France's education minister, paid tribute to Ms Calmes. Using her maiden name, he said: 'I want to pay tribute to the memory of Fabienne Terral-Calmes.

'She was 34, a school teacher, mother to two little girls, Romane et Adele, who have lost their mummy. And the national education system has lost a formidable teacher.'

President François Hollande described the killing as a 'horrific tragedy'

The attack took place around 9am at the school in the Lapanouse area of the town which has 284 pupils aged from three to 11.

The murderer fled the scene of the crime, and evaded arrest for 20 minutes before police found her near her home. The victim’s time of death was 11am.

Ms Derens said the identity of the attacker would not be released at present, but that she was aged 47 and had a police record.

The mother was last year spoken to by police about neglecting a child under 15, and attempting to delay a search for a missing child.

She is currently in custody, where she is likely to remain until a criminal trial sometime next year, when she will face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of murder.

France’s Education Minister Benoit Hamon said the whole of France was ‘deeply shocked’ by a crime which came at the end of the school year.

He said it highlighted the need to improve security in schools. President Francois Hollande also condemned a ‘horrible tragedy’. 

President François Hollande described the killing as a 'horrific tragedy' and despatched Education Minister Benoit Hamon to the school.

A government spokesman said: 'All state services will be mobilized to look after the students and the personnel who witnessed this horrific tragedy.'

There have only been four known cases of teachers being killed in class in France over the past three decades.

The last was in 1995 when 51-year-old English teacher Michel Antoine was beaten to death in the south west town of Dax by two students, one of whom had just failed his exams. Both murderers ended up serving ten years in prison.

In October 2012 a father was sentenced to three years in prison, with 18 months suspended, for hitting a Lyon gym teacher with a truncheon.

The latest killing came as France's national statistics agency, Insee, revealed that 12 percent of teachers and other education staff had suffered threats and other forms of abuse in class.A further 0.6 percent reported actual physical attacks.
