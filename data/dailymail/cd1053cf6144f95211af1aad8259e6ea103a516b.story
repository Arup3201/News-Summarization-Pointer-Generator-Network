GP3 driver Konstantin Tereshchenko survived a terrifying crash at Spa that saw his car fly into the air, roll and then burst into flames.

The 20-year-old caught the kerbat turn 18 during a practice session at the Belgian Grand Prix and his car was sent out of control.

Tereshchenko flew threw the air, over the track and on to the run-off area, before his car rolled as it landed.

The car then erupted into flames as it came to rest near a barrier and Tereshchenko quickly jumped out unharmed. 

The young Russian driver was making his debut in the GP3 series for the Trident team.
