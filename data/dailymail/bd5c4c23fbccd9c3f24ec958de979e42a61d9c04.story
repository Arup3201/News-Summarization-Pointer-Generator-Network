Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo didn’t practice on Wednesday ahead of his side’s Wembley clash with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.

Romo sustained a back injury in Dallas’s loss to divisional rivals Washington Redskins two weeks ago, and was absent for Sunday’s 28-17 defeat to Arizona Cardinals.

Speaking at Saracens’ Allianz Park on Wednesday, Dallas head coach Jason Garrett confirmed Romo’s absence from the day’s practice.

‘Romo participated in the walkthrough but he will not practice today,’ Garrett said. ‘He’ll follow a normal schedule and we’ll listen to his body.

‘Getting feedback from the player as to how they feel and how they handle the workload is really, really important. Then you come up with what you need to do during the week to get them prepared to play their best on Sunday.

‘It’s always a medical decision first. It’s always a grey area when you’re dealing with injuries – it’s never black and white. But it seems like he’s moving around well.’

Romo’s injury struggles and Dallas’s shaky form didn’t seem to be affecting Garrett, though - the 48-year-old spoke of his excitement at visiting London and playing in front of a sold-out Wembley crowd.

‘I have been over here a couple of times playing games, and the atmosphere at the old Wembley Stadium was fantastic,’ Garrett continued.

‘It seems like the British fan base for American football is strong. I feel like there’s a real interest in our game, and any time I’ve been over here they’ve really shown that to us.

‘It’s a great opportunity for us to come to one of the great cities and play in one of the great stadiums in the world.’
