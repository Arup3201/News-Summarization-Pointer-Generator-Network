A mother claims to have proof that fairies do exist -  after catching one on her home CCTV system. 

Lucia Cordaro, 37, is convinced that her security system, set up outside her home in Chester, has captured a clear image of one of the tiny mythical winged creatures flitting past the lens.

She said she was getting in to bed when she heard a noisy motorbike revving outside her house.

She later looked at the CCTV footage on her laptop she was shocked to see what she thought was a tiny tinkerbell flying past the camera

After creeping downstairs to investigate the commotion, the mother-of-one heard a bang and thought that somebody had hurled a missile at her window.

But when she looked at the CCTV footage on her laptop she was shocked to see what she thought was a tiny tinkerbell flying past the camera.

Ms Cordaro, a songwriter, said: 'I'm quite a logical person but I think seeing is believing.'

She said she had only woken up to see what the noise outside was about. 

She said: 'It was just after 11pm and I was getting into bed. I live in the end house on my street and I could hear the motorbike on the corner.

Ms Cordaro, a songwriter, said: 'I'm quite a logical person but I think seeing is believing'

'There was this thump on my living room window and I thought someone had chucked something at the window. I thought 'Ha, gotcha' because I knew it would be caught on my CCTV.

'When I looked on the camera I thought 'that's a bit odd'.

'I thought 'if that's a butterfly it looks a lot like a fairy' but I mean, what are the chances? It's very strange.

'I was rewinding and rewinding and rewinding but the more I saw it the more I was convinced.'

While some cynics might say the footage could be simply a moth flying past the camera lens,  one person is a confirmed believer - her four- year-old son. 

He immediately spotted the mystical creature and identified it as one of Santa's little helpers.

She said: 'When I showed my four-year-old son he said "Wow. Do you think he's going to go back to Father Christmas and tell him I'm a good boy?"

'There was no doubt in his mind.'
