Designer Donna Karan suffered an accident during a recent trip which has left her wheelchair-bound.

The 66-year-old arrived at designer Oscar de la Renta's funeral in New York earlier this morning with an Ace elastic bandage wrapped around her left foot and ankle and was seated in a wheelchair which was being pushed by a fellow mourner.

A spokesman for the designer told MailOnline that Donna sustained the injury during a recent trip, but insisted that she is on the speedy road to recovery.

'Oscar was the ultimate Renaissance man, a true visionary, and he made it look effortless,' she wrote, alongside an image of herself posing with the designer.

'He loved and lived life to the fullest. His passing is the end of an era. Thank you, Oscar, for leading the way forward.'
