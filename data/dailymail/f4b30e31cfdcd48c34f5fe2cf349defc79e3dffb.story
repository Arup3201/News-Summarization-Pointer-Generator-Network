A gunman armed with two fully loaded shotguns and a knife has been arrested by French police after he was spotted 'armed to the teeth' and walking towards Cannes city centre.

His arrest comes just hours after the French government ordered an extra 300 soldiers to patrol city streets in an attempt to quell a spate of 'lone wolf' attacks that have rocked the country this week.

The wave of violence began on Saturday with the stabbing of three police officers and was followed by two incidents in which vehicles were driven into groups of pedestrians, injuring dozens.

The French government requested an additional 300 troops to conduct foot patrols after three police officers were stabbed on Saturday and dozens of pedestrians injured when vehicles were driven into them on Sunday and Monday

The latest arrest comes after police spotted the gunman on CCTV 'armed to the teeth' and walking into Cannes city centre in south east France.

While his intentions were not immediately clear, he was arrested near Forville market armed with two loaded shotguns and a 25cm knife, Sky News reported. 

On Monday, after three days of seemingly random acts of violence, France's government implored people to remain calm.

It began on Saturday when a man was shot dead by police after stabbing three police officers.

Bertrand Nzohabonayo was killed after entering a police station in the central town with a knife and seriously wounding two officers, including slashing one in the face.

Nzohabonayo, who had posted an IS flag on his Facebook account, was a French national born in Burundi in 1994.

He was also heard shouting 'Allahu Akbar' during the assault and local prosecutor Jean-Luc Beck said investigators would seek to determine whether 'he acted alone or if he acted on orders'. 

The brother of Nzohabonayo, who attacked police Saturday, was arrested the same day in their homeland, Burundi. The country's intelligence spokesman said both men had links with radical Islam. In an interview Tuesday with French radio, their sister denied it.

The Dijon man, who cried out 'God is great' in Arabic, had been hospitalized 157 times since 2001, the prosecutor said. She described him as having an 'incoherent' motive involving the treatment of Chechen children.

Over the next two days, two men drove vehicles into pedestrians in almost identical attacks.

Officials said they were unrelated, and that the two drivers in particular had no direct links to terrorism or radical Islam. The prime minister lamented 'the ravages of propaganda on fragile minds' before increasing military patrols.

'People were running everywhere,' said Mohammed Bader Ghegate, who was among the witnesses in the Monday night attack at the Christmas market in Nantes.

A 25-year-old man died yesterday of injuries sustained in the attack, local prosecutor Brigitte Lamy said at a news conference. The driver remains hospitalized and police have not been able to question him, Lamy said.

Just a day before, on the other side of France, another driver had done almost exactly the same thing, bumping over sidewalks and into small groups of people throughout the city of Dijon. Thirteen people were injured.

Both suspects, who survived, have long histories of mental illness. The first attack to set France on edge in recent days, the stabbing of three police officers on Saturday, is so far the only one drawing the attention of counterterrorism investigators.

'These three events have no links, but there is a concurrence that requires vigilance,' President Francois Hollande said.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls urged France to avoid overreacting to isolated incidents in a country on alert after repeated threats from Muslim extremists, including one broadcast in a propaganda video on Friday by a masked and bearded Frenchman surrounded by gun-toting Islamic State fighters.

'We want to protect and reassure the French people,' Valls said, announcing that as many as 300 soldiers would be added to patrols already in place.
