A mother has been arrested on murder charges after she allegedly threw her six-year-old autistic son from a bridge.

Jillian Meredith McCabe, 34, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was in custody over the aggravated murder and first-degree manslaughter of her son London, NBC reported.  

The boy's body was found late on Monday night after a woman earlier reported throwing her son off the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Oregon at 6.30pm, police said on Tuesday.

London McCabe was discovered in freezing waters about a mile from the bridge around four hours after his mother said she had thrown him in from about 100 feet up. 

The six-year-old's cause of death is not yet known.  

According to NBC, Mrs McCabe last year set up an online fundraising appeal to help care for her severely autistic son and husband, Matt, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and having a mass on his brain stem in November 2013.

Detectives were questioning the woman who made the 911 call on Monday evening. 

The head of police in the coastal community, Newport's Chief Mark Miranda, was on the scene and said that even if someone survived the fall, the cold water would kill in around 20 minutes. 

The Coast Guard and Lincoln County authorities searched for hours after the call came in about 6.25pm on Monday. Officers found a woman at the scene.

 The body was found floating near a marina after being spotted by a witness from a restaurant close to the Yaquina Bay Bridge. 

The Coast Guard dispatched two boats and a helicopter to search the water. The county sheriff's marine patrol and county search and rescue teams were also involved.

McCabe is being held on $750,000 bail. 

In 2011, Matt McCabe, who works for a marketing firm, posted a message on social media sharing the news that his son was 'severely autistic' but was receiving medication and treatment from therapists.

Jillian McCabe had separated from her husband (pictured right with their son) earlier this year, according to a blog post by him, but later reconciled 

In November 2013, a YouCaring fundraising page called, Help Matt on the long Recovery Road, was set up by Jillian McCabe to help pay for hospital bills and long-term care. 

On the page, she wrote: 'My husband went from being able to walk/drive/work/make money/talk/throw our son in the air to being diagnosed with MS, having a mass in the brain stem, he is now walking with a walker, not being able to drive/work/make money, he now slurs his speech...

'Matt went from the sole bread winner and provider to not in a matter of 2 weeks.'

The blog also mentioned a link to another blog, since shut down, called autisticlondon.com. 

Mrs McCabe went on to write that her husband was deeply worried about not having health insurance and medical bills.

She wrote: 'Matt's laying in a hospital bed talking about the email project he was working on, complaining we don't have insurance, we don't have the money for hospital bills, he has a shopping cart website to work on...'

She closed with the words: 'I NEED YOUR HELP.' 

The family raised close to $7,000 of a $50,000 target.

In a blog post earlier this year by Mr McCabe, he wrote that he and his wife were undergoing a trial separation but appeared to have reconciled a few months later.
