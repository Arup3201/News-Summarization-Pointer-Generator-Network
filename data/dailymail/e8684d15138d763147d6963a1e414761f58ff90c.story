The lawyer wife of movie star George Clooney is set to represent fourteen Irish men who claim they were tortured by the British Army.

Amal Clooney has joined the legal team representing the victims - known as the 'Hooded Men' - who were subjected to horrific treatment, including being deprived of sleep, food and water for days.

Clooney, a 37-year-old international law and human rights specialist, will represent the men at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg as they seek to have their treatment acknowledged as torture.

Distinguished: Amal Clooney will join the legal team set to represent 14 Irish men who claim they were subjected to torture methods by the British Government in the 1970s

Newly married: Amal, 37, with her movie star husband George. She has enjoyed a distinguished career as an international law and human rights specialist

The men were imprisoned under the British government's internment programme in August 1971, when more than 340 men were rounded up across Northern Ireland.

They were then selected for 'deep interrogation' at a specially-built centre at a British Army camp, and subjected to 'five techniques' of torture, which included hooding, being made to stand in prolonged stress positions, white noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink. 

On their way to the interrogation centre in 1971, some of the men were hooded and thrown to the ground from helicopters. 

They had been told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but in fact they were just a few feet from the ground.

None of the men were ever convicted of any offence.

In 1976, the European Commission for Human Rights ruled that the British government was guilty of torture, inhumane and degrading treatment. 

The case was then referred to the European Court for Human Rights, which ruled in 1978 that while the five techniques amounted to 'inhumane and degrading treatment', they did not constitute torture.

Victims: Colm O'Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, (front right) with a number of the surviving victims. They became known as the 'Hooded Men' after revealing details of their treatment

But the case will now be reopened after declassified documents were discovered in the British national archives last year that revealed that the British government had withheld crucial evidence from the European Court during the original hearing.

The files show that the British government considered the 'special treatment' as torture and yet senior Ministers still sanctioned its use in Northern Ireland - both claims they had denied before the European Court.

The Ministry of Defence has consistently rejected allegations that it used torture.

Venue: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where the men will take their case

There was controversy last year when it was revealed that some IRA prisoners were afforded pardons while the Good Friday Agreement was being negotiated.

The government scheme applied to people wanted for paramilitary crimes committed before the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. 

Necessary: Former PM Tony Blair, who described the 'On The Runs' scheme as fundamental to the Northern Ireland Peace Processsw

Recently, then Prime Minister Tony Blair said the peace process in Northern Ireland would probably have collapsed without the 'On The Runs' scheme for fugitive IRA members.

His Labour government sent about 200 letters to republicans assuring them they were not being pursued by the UK authorities for historical crimes. 

Last month, Mr Blair told MPs investigating the scheme: 'The issue of On The Runs was absolutely critical to the peace process and at certain points became fundamental to it.'

The scheme has been in the spotlight after an investigation was launched  when the prosecution of a man for the murder of four soldiers in a bombing in Hyde Park in 1982 was halted after he received one of the letters in error. 

A review last year into the scheme by Lady Justice Hallett's review was ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron. 

The review found the scheme had 'significant systemic failures' in how it operated, but ruled it was lawful.

Lady Justice Hallett's report found the administrative scheme was kept 'below the radar' due to its political sensitivity, but said it would be wrong to characterise the scheme as 'secret'.

She added: 'If there was a lack of clarity and openness, responsibility lies with the UK government.'
