The Seven Network has been forced to abandon plans to 'simulate a car explosion' in the same Sydney suburb where a deadly blast killed three people earlier this month. 

Seven was branded 'insensitive and offensive' by former Leichhardt mayor Darcy Byrne over the planned blast in Rozelle, in Sydney's inner west, which was to be filmed just streets away from the recent disaster as part of a Rebecca Gibney crime drama.

Bianka O'Brien, 31, her baby boy Jude and neighbour Chris Noble, 27, died on September 4 when a massive explosion occurred at a Rozelle convenience store below their homes on Darling St, the suburb's main thoroughfare, in the early hours of the morning. 

Seven's simulated blast was due to occur between 1pm and 5:45pm on Friday but following the uproar a spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the scene had been 'reworked'.

All smiles: Gibney appeared upbeat as filming commenced in Rozelle - without the planned car explosion.

Mr Byrne said: 'Common sense would dictate that an explosion in Balmain or Rozelle at this time is insensitive and offensive.

'Whoever has approved this to take place should think have thought through more carefully the emotional impact of the people in Rozelle'. 

Mr Byrne said the recent explosion had taken a heavy toll on the suburb.

'The buildings were flattened, our economy has been severely damaged but its the human cost of this tragedy that has hit people so hard.' 

Firefighters planned to be present at the scene of the blast, according to emails seen by Daily Mail Australia.

Residents were also notified of the planned explosion, which would have involved a modified car where the fuel tank and all fluids and gases had been removed.

The O'Briens and Mr Noble were asleep in their apartments when the explosion that killed them occurred earlier this month.

Adeel Khan, 44, who ran the convenience store below the apartments where the explosion occurred, has been charged over their deaths.

Over a week ago, mourners gathered on a bright spring day at a Rozelle church to pay tribute ot the O'Briens.

A service was held for Mr Noble in his home town of Canowindra earlier this month. Two others were injured in the blast.
