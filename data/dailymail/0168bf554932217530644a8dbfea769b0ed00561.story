The hotshot executive hired to help turn around the Today show’s slump in the ratings is departing less than three month after taking over.

Former ESPN executive Jamie Horowitz 'was not the right fit' according to a staff memo sent on Monday by NBC News President Deborah Turness.

Once the nation's leading network morning show, Today has fallen behind ABC's Good Morning America in the battle for ratings over the past two years.

When the Horowitz’s hire was first announced in May, Turness said he would push the Today brand and look for new opportunities online and with events.

But show insiders told The Wrap that Horowitz managed to alienate both presenters and producers alike during his brief tenure after he sought to pit staff against each other and create an unsettled environment.

One source said he had invoked the reality show Survivor in conversations with staffers, asking them which producers they think should be ‘voted off the island’ (aka fired).

'There was a lot of insecurity and instability created when he walked in the door. He would pit anchors against anchors and producers against producers and it created a lot of internal problems,' another source told the New York Post.

Overseeing: NBC News President Deborah Turness broke the news of Horowitz's departure on Monday

‘He would ask the staff who they wanted to be their seniors and who were the weakest links in the organization.’

Horowitz wasn't supposed to officially start running the show until December 1, but had been on a 'listening tour' since September. 

His vision to topple GMA was not met favorably by the show's anchors, while producers were left fearing for their jobs. Horowitz was said to be completely caught off guard by the decision to let him go.

In her memo to staff, Turness says Horowitz would be replaced in 'due course' and she will help oversee the show in the meantime.

NBC News declined to comment on Horowitz's departure.

Horowitz was president of original programming and production at ESPN. His TV career started with an entry-level position on NBC's Olympics team.

The Today show continues to be rocked by reports of tensions on set.

Last week it was reported that Natalie Morales is looking for new roles after falling out with fellow co-host Tamron Hall.

Morales joined the Today team in 2006 as a national correspondent but she has missed out on being the top anchor, including when Ann Curry left in 2012.

Following Curry's emotional exit after just a year in the job, she was replaced by Savannah Guthrie.

Morales and NBC News President Deborah Turness have not spoken in months, according to sources.
