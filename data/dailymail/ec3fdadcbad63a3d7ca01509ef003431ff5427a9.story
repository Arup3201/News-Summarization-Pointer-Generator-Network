The right hand man of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in a US airstrike in northern Iraq, according to senior security officials.

Damaging blow: A key aide of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed by a US airstrike over Mosul, northern Iraq according to security sources

Two days after video showing the execution of Steven Sotloff was released, US warplanes struck a damaging blow at the heart of ISIS in Mosul, killing Abu Hajar Al-Sufi.

And at the NATO summit in Wales this afternoon, Secretary of State John Kerry was seen to quietly pass President Obama a note during an address by British Prime Minister David Cameron,.

After Cameron finished speaking, members of the press pool were cleared from the conference hall

While it has not been confirmed if Obama learned of Al-Sufi's death through Kerry's note, the president was noticeably absent for the beginning of a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine commission later-on at the summit.

A senior Iraqi security official confirmed the news of the deadly air strike to NBC News and is the most significant blow against ISIS since the United States began action last month.

Al Arabiya news quoted the Iraqi Defense Ministry to say Baghdadi's aide perished along with an explosives expert and the military chief in nearby town Tel Afar.

It has not been confirmed when the airstrike took place but on Tuesday US military officials said a sortie against ISIS militants in Iraq damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles near the Mosul Dam.

The confirmation of the deadly strike demonstrates that the US is clearly targeting ISIS's leadership and clarifies rumors circulating yesterday that al-Baghdadi himself was killed in the raid.

Indeed, multiple sources, including former Iraqi army officers, told the Daily Beast on Wednesday that al-Baghdadi had died in Syria after being seriously injured in an Iraqi or American airstrike in the north of Iraq. 

While the significance of Al-Sufi's death for al-Baghdadi and ISIS is not yet clear, the loss of his right-hand man cannot be underestimated.

The presence of Al-Sufi in Mosul shows that al-Baghdadi could be worried about losing Mosul to a combination of US airstrikes and Kurdish and Iraqi counter attacks.

Sending his right-hand man there to oversee the fight would go a long way to confirming this, but regardless, Al-Sufi's death is a blow to the ISIS hierarchy.

The strike against the terror groups leadership came as Western leaders at the summit ramped up their rhetoric against ISIS. 

Indeed, world leaders, nervously eyeing a growing threat from Islamic State militants, are seeking to build a united front this week against the violent extremist group and keep it from creeping beyond its borders.

Yet international plans to counter the Islamic State group - with combined military might, diplomatic pressure on abetting partners and economic penalties - still pale in comparison to the extremists' ruthlessness and command of the swath of land it controls across parts of northern Syria and Iraq. 

For the second time in as many weeks, Islamic State militants released a video showing the beheading of an American journalist, and governments from Britain to Saudi Arabia to Australia warned of the potential of their citizens joining the fight - and then bringing the violence back home.

'Our objective is clear, and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so that it's no longer a threat,' President Barack Obama said Wednesday during a visit to Estonia, using an alternate acronym for the Islamic State. He later headed to Wales for an annual meeting of leaders of the NATO military alliance.

Separately, during an appearance in Maine, Vice President Joe Biden declared that the U.S. will pursue the militants to 'the gates of hell.'

In Wales, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was considering joining a nearly monthlong U.S. airstrike campaign in Iraq against the Islamic State group, adding to military aid that London has already approved.

'We'll always ask ourselves what is in our national interest,' Cameron said, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper. 'Not ruling things out, but going forward in a deliberate, sensible, resolute way.'

Cameron and Obama collaborated on an op-ed piece published Thursday in the Times of London, writing, 'Countries like Britain and America will not be cowed by barbaric killers.'

And in the Mideast, the United Arab Emirates called for a coordinated international effort to tackle the 'global scourge' of terrorism, raising particular concern about the threat posed by Islamic State fighters.

Might: The United States began limited airstrikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq in August after the terror group began to exercise control over large swathes of territory 

Mobile: A convoy of vehicles and fighters from ISIS move through Iraq's Anbar Province. The Islamic State group holds roughly a third of Iraq and Syria, including several strategically important cities like Fallujah and Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. It rules over a population of several million people with its strict interpretation of Islamic law

The heightened urgency reflected fears that the Islamic State was growing stronger in its quest to create a caliphate territory in the Mideast and systematically kill any who resist. The group is considered even more merciless toward its enemies than the al-Qaida terror network, and intelligence officials across the world warn that it may soon seek to seed its violence beyond its declared borders.

So far, the Islamic State has beheaded two American journalists it held captive for what the militants called payback for more than 120 U.S. airstrikes on its assets in northern Iraq since Aug. 8. Journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were two of what the State Department has described as 'a few' Americans still being held hostage by the group. The Islamic State also had threatened to kill a British man it is holding hostage.

 In a statement Wednesday, a family spokesman said Sotloff dedicated his life to portraying the suffering of people in war zones, but was 'no hero.'

The Islamic State group spearheaded an offensive in June, seizing vast swaths of northern Iraq, including the country's second largest city Mosul.

In recent weeks the battle has raged between US backed forces and ISIS for the Mosul Dam which controls water and electricity across northern Iraq.

'ISIS keeps trying to take it back,' Rear. Admiral John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said at a briefing Tuesday.

'As long as they continue to pose a threat to the facility we are going to continue to hit them,' Kirby said.

Each day ISIS militants fight Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US airstrikes in the region.

The US has launched dozens of airstrikes around the dam since ISIS abandoned it to Iraqi and Kurdish forces in mid-August.

The United States fears not only the strategic significance of the dam for ISIS, but also the catastrophic threat posed if the terror group attempts to blow up the dam and flood the surrounding region. 

Family spokesman Barak Barfi told reporters gathered outside the family's suburban Miami home that Sotloff 'tried to find good concealed in a world of darkness,' and to give voice to the weak and suffering in the Arab world. Barfi said Sotloff was 'no war junkie,' but was drawn to the stories of the turbulent Middle East, and his family has pledged to 'not allow our enemies to hold us hostage with the sole weapon they possess - fear.'

 Sotloff, a 31-year-old who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines before he was captured in Syria a year ago, was also an Israeli citizen. But his Jewish faith and Israeli citizenship were not widely known before his death - in part because Israel's military censor apparently kept a lid on the story for his safety - and his killers are not believed to have known about his background.

In Washington, Obama administration officials maintained that the U.S. will not launch a ground war against the Islamic State militants. But they stopped short of ruling out airstrikes against the group in its safe haven in Syria, as the U.S. has resisted for years.

Obama has 'been clear that we're not going to be limited by geography,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She described a range of actions being considered against the Islamic State, and noted that decisions and discussions were ongoing.

Over the past day, Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration officials have reached out to leaders from Australia, the UAE, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Israel to discuss how to combat the Islamic State. Psaki said the discussions focused on what each country might contribute - including weapons, humanitarian aid and other resources - and noted that some nations already have.

Obama 'wants to build an international coalition,' Psaki said. 'That's not going to be overnight. We need capabilities from many countries.'

The push also mirrors concerns that the Islamic State will lure foreigners to the fight - who will then return home to launch attacks.

A compilation of government estimates shows more than 2,000 people with European passports have fought or are fighting in Syria and Iraq, with most looking to join the Islamic State group.
