When Lay's announced that it would be launching a chocolate-covered potato chip, the reception was divided. But now that the limited-edition snack has gone on sale, Femail has had a chance to put it to the test.

Proving the doubters wrong, the reaction to the salted Wavy chips dipped on one side in milk chocolate has been overwhelmingly positive.

The five bags distributed across the team disappeared in a heartbeat - despite containing 800 calories each.

Sweet AND salty: Lay's milk chocolate-covered potato chips have proved a unanimous hit on team Femail

Reporter Margot Peppers reflected on this fact afterwards, calling them 'very, very addictive.

'They were the perfect balance of sweet and salty,' she continued. 'Although the chocolate was 
pretty rich. I couldn’t stop eating them!'

Editorial manager Lucy Jones said they were 'like choc covered pretzels, but better,' and photo director Jolie Novak 'loved the smooth chocolate with a crunch and the subtle salty taste at the end.'

Femail deputy editor Olivia Fleming 
hailed them 'the best thing since the Cronut' - high praise indeed - 
while social media editor Taylor Lorenz said that 'they are everything 
I'd ever want in a potato chip and candy bar. I can't wait to pre-order 
them by the box.'

The chips were not without some 
critique though. A couple of tasters remarked that they would have 
preferred more chip and less chocolate - while another mused whether a 
dark chocolate version would be tastier.

What's more, even this snack-loving team felt defeated after eating too many.

One editor admitted that they are 'totally delicious' but 'the bag is too big. Now I feel sick.'

Margot echoed the opinion, but added: 'It was worth it though.'

Success! The positive verdicts indicate that Lay's has struck gold with this unlikely combination

The chocolate chips are a limited-edition, only be available during the holidays and exclusively at Target stores.

If they 
prove popular, however, they could be made a permanent addition to the Lay's product 
line.

'When
 you try something drastically different, you have to walk before you 
can run,'  said Ram Krishnan, vice president of marketing at Frito-Lay. 'We wanted to test our way through this before 
we go big.'

Lay's chocolate potato chips is the latest unlikely product to combine sweet and salty flavors, a growing trend in the $31billion snack market that food manufacturers are keen to cash in on.

Last month Pringles announced that it would be launching a series of holiday-themed flavors including mint-chocolate chip, pecan pie and cinnamon and sugar.

If it proves a success, Mr Krishnan says 'it gives us latitude to offer other
 flavor combinations that we've never done. . . [It] opens a world of possibilities that we haven't explored before.'
