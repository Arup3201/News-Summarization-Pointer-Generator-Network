Police said the 19-year-old driver Alejandro Hernandez was racing two other cars when he lost control and veered into oncoming traffic.

The two victims, Jose Serrano, 43, and his 15-year-old son German, were driving home from a family day out.

The boy’s mother, 42-year-old Carmen Otra, and the couple’s other son, 12-year-old Gabriel Serrano, were in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.

Relatives said the family of four were on their way home from a relative's house when they were hit by a Toyota Scion.

'The impact was so massive that it caused this SUV, just tossed it around,' said Detective Willie Moreno of Miami Police. 'The vehicle continued to rotate an additional three times before coming to a resting point.'

'I have a lot of faith in God that she will get through this,' said Vega with tears in her eyes.

'She is very injured. Her head is open. The boy is also very hurt. His head is open as well. They are operating on him right now.'

The driver of one of the drag racing vehicles, 19-year-old Alejandro Hernandez, was in critical condition.

His passenger Ivan Rodriguez Jr died from injuries caused when the Toyota Scion car they were in 'exploded' on impact.

Clean up: The family had been driving home from a relatives house in the early hours of Saturday when their SUV was struck

Police said Hernandez’ Toyota Scion was drag racing against a Chevy Impala and another vehicle in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The vehicles were racing eastbound at up to 100 miles per hour in an area where the speed limit was 30 to 35mph.

The Scion lost control, swerving into westbound traffic where it struck a Ford Expedition being drive by Jose Serrano.

The impact was so severe, it caused the engine block of the Scion to be torn off its compartment while that of the Expedition to be pushed into its own passenger compartment.

Moreno said the impact tossed the SUV around three times before it came to rest.
