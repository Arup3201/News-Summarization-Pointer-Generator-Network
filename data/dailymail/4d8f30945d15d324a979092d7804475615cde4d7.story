Dead: Cassidy Charette, 17, of Oakland died overnight of injuries sustained during a Harvest Hill Farms hay ride in Mechanic Falls, Maine

A teenage girl has died and 22 others are hurt after a Jeep pulling a trailer with more than 20 passengers careened down a hill in a Maine forest hitting a tree and flipping over, authorities say.

Cassidy Charette, 17, of Oakland died overnight of injuries sustained during a Harvest Hill Farms hay ride in Mechanic Falls, Maine, according to Maine State Public Safety spokesperson Steve McCausland.

Bangor Daily News reports that Charette and seven other students from Messalonskee High School in Oakland were on the hayride at the time of the crash, including 16-year-old Connor Garland, of Belgrade, who is listed in critical condition at Boston Children’s Hospital.

Both Garland and the Jeep's driver, David Brown, 54, of South Paris, are in critical condition.

'It was just kids out on a Saturday night hayride,' McCausland told BDN.

McCausland told the Portland Press Herald that 15 of the injured were taken to Central Maine Medical Center, seven were taken to St. Mary's Regional Medical Center (both in Lewiston), one person was taken to the Maine Medical Center in Portland for treatment, and two people were transported to hospitals by LifeFlight.

The victims were travelling on The Gauntlet Haunted Night Ride trailer at Pumpkin Land in Mechanic Falls when the vehicle overturned. 

All of the victims are reportedly aged 15 or older.

The accident occurred at around 8.30pm Saturday at the top of a hill at Harvest Hill Farms, situated on Route 26, around 30 miles north of Portland, according to the PPH. 

During the ride, which includes 'things that jump and scream in the night,' the driver of a jeep pulling the trailer missed a right-hand turn, said Androscoggin County Sheriff, Guy Desjardins.

The vehicle then flipped over, injuring everyone on board including the driver. 

'The trailer jackknifed and the jeep went off the road,' Desjardins told the PPH, describing the woodland hill as 'very steep'. 

'We're talking about a very narrow dirt road, but extremely steep,' he said. 

He added: 'I’ve never witnessed a single incident that resulted in so many injuries.'

Following the incident, seven fire crews and three police departments - including state police - rushed to the scene, David Clukey, of the Mechanic Falls Fire Department, told CNN.

Jennifer Johnson, a nursing supervisor at St. Mary's in Lewiston, said the hospital had received seven patients from the incident, all of whom were 'stable'.

WCSH 6 reports that investigators believe the cause of the accident may have been a mechanical problem with the Jeep. 

Authorities will inspect the Jeep as part of an investigation into the cause of the accident.  

Hospital: Two people were airlifted to hospital following the crash, while the 21 others - including the driver - were taken by ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston and St. Mary's Regional Medical Center in Lewiston; one was taken to the Maine Medical Center in Portland

On Saturday night, the Portland Fire Department tweeted: 'Thoughts and prayers with the victims, their families, and the emergency crews operating … in Mechanic Falls.'
