A baby has been nicknamed Harry thanks to a thick head of hair that makes him look like  One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles.

Four-month-old Harvey Johnson was born with dark luscious locks, much to the surprise of his parents.

Mother and father Lucy Carter, 26, and Ian Johnson, 32, from Hitchin, Herts., were stunned when his mane just kept on growing.

Little Harvey has gained his nickname from One Direction crooner Harry Style's thick floppy hair which he either wears wild and tousled, left, or teased into a voluminous bouffant as at a Burberry show in 2013

'When Harvey was born all the midwives kept coming in to see him as his hair was so unusual,' said Lucy.

'Usually a baby's hair falls out after it is born but Harvey's has kept on growing and is really quite thick. I haven't seen any other babies with as much hair as him.

His thick brown hair, which, in some pictures, stands straight on end, looks for all the world like singer Harry Styles' voluminous coiffeur.  

Lucy said: 'His nickname is Harry because so many people think he looks like Harry Styles with all his hair.'

Lucy and Ian, who is a postman, said that everywhere they go people are astonished by the amount of hair Harvey has.

'We both have dark hair and had some hair when we were born, but nowhere near as much as him.'

'We already have to shampoo his hair on a regular basis.

Harvey was born with an unusually thick head of hair that didn't fall out as most babies' hair does

Little Harvey's thatch also seems as untamed as 20-year-old star Harry's, whose tousled mane has earned him legions of female admirers and male fans.

From wearing it loose and disarrayed, Harry has also made it okay for men to wear hairbands. He's also joined the man bun trend, scraping his thick locks away from his face.

Lucy and Ian have certainly had fun with Harvey's hair.

When he was born it looked like a long fuzz but since then it's grown inches and his doting parents either brush it on end, give him a mohawk or let it stick out in every direction.

They've even created Superman's distinctive kiss curl on Harvey's forehead.
