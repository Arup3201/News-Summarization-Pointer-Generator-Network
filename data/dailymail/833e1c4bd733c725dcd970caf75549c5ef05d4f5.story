John Boehner, the Republican
U.S. House of Representatives speaker, said on SUnday that he is 'certainly' willing to let
funding for the Department of Homeland Security lapse as part of
a Republican push to roll back President Barack Obama's
executive actions on immigration.

With a Feb. 27 deadline looming for funding the department,
Senate Democrats three times this month blocked consideration of
the Homeland Security appropriations bill, which has already
been approved by the House.

'Senate Democrats are the ones standing in the way. They're
the ones jeopardizing funding,' Boehner told Fox News on Sunday.
Asked if he was prepared to let financing for the department
lapse, he said: 'Certainly. The House has acted. We've done our
job.'

'CERTAINLY': Boehner threw down the gauntlet on Sunday, saying he's prepared to see the Homeland Security Department strapped for cash if Senate Democrats don't agree to a vote on the agency's budget

Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer warns that Republicans will pay a political price if DHS funding runs out, but the GOP gained big at the polls in 2014 following a partial government-wide shutdown a year earlier

Last week in an angry moment, Boehner called on Senate Democrats to 'get up off their a** and do something.' 

Arizona Senator John McCain, a leading Republican voice on
national security matters, told NBC's 'Meet the Press' of his
alarm at the situation.

'The American people did not give us majority to have a
fight between House and Senate Republicans,' McCain said,
referring to Republicans taking control of both the House and
Senate after November's congressional elections. 

'They want
things done. You cannot cut funding from the Department of
Homeland Security. We need to sit down and work this thing out.'

Democrats want to fund the department but oppose House
amendments stripping funding from Obama's 2012 and 2014
executive orders lifting a deportation threat for millions of
illegal immigrants.

The Republican legislation passed by the House put Senate
Republicans in a tough position because not only do they lack
the votes to prevent Obama's fellow Democrats from using
procedural hurdles to block the bill but also some Republican
senators have expressed misgivings about tying homeland security
funding to the immigation issue.

'The House has acted to de-fund the department and to stop
the president's overreach when it comes to immigration and his
executive orders,' Boehner said. 

'The Congress just
can't sit by and let the president defy the Constitution and
defy his own his oath of office.'

Senate Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, warned Boehner that he risked incurring the wrath of voters if the standoff persists into March.

'He knew exactly what he was doing,' Schumer said of the speaker in a staetment, 'saying "Unless I get my way, I'm going to shut down a large part of the government".'

'To now blame Democrats when members of his own party, conservative leaders and others have all asked him to back off this game of chicken is disingenuous at best.'

If Boehner sticks to his guns 'as he did in 2013,' Schumer predicted, 'he will be responsible for shutting down a large part of the government, the American people will perceive it that way, and his party and the country will suffer for it.'

'Senate Democrats are the ones standing in the way. They'rethe ones jeopardizing funding,' Boehner told 'Fox News Sunday' host Chris Wallace (right)

BLAME THE TEA PARTY: Far-left House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Boehner is being held captive by the far right

Voters, however, punished Democrats, not Republicans, in 2014, the national election following the 2013 partial government shutdown. The GOP gained control of the Senate where Schumer is now in a shrinking minority, and added to its majority in the House.

Nancy Pelosi, who lost the speakership to Boehner in the tea party landslide of 2010, added to the carping from the left.

'With only four legislative days left until the Republican
Homeland Security Shutdown, Speaker Boehner made it clear that
he has no plan to avoid a government shutdown that would
threaten the safety of the American people,' Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told Reuters.

'The speaker's reliance on talking points and
finger-pointing was a sad reflection of the fact that (the) Tea
Party continues to hold the gavel as they insist on their futile
anti-immigrant grandstanding.'

Obama has threatened to veto the House-passed measure. 

Democrats insist on a 'clean' funding bill with no immigration
restrictions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a
Republican, said last week that the Senate was 'stuck' and the
next move was up to the House.

'Unfortunately, I don't see exactly how Congress is going to
resolve this,' White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told
CBS's 'Face the Nation.'
