Diego Costa lasted just nine minutes of the Champions League final before his hamstring injury forced him off.

The Atletico Madrid striker was risked by manager Diego Simeone gainst city rivals Real despite tearing his hamstring in the win over Barcelona.

But to nobody's great surprise, Costa did not even make it to the 10-minute mark in Lisbon, being replaced by Adrian Lopez.

Gamble backfired: Starting Costa was a risk for Atletico and the striker blatantly was not fit

The centre forward must now be a doubt for Spain's World Cup squad and Vicente Del Bosque names his party on Sunday.

Costa had been to Belgrade to see doctor Marijana Kovacevic, who uses fluid derived from horse placenta to repair damaged cells.

And he trained with Atletico last week, which presumably convinced Simeone that he was ready for action.

However, he blatantly was not and after a handful of laboured runs, he made his exit.
