It was discovered in 1918 near the temple of Dendera on the west bank of the Nile and acquired by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo – but its significance has only just been realised.

Now researchers believe that a 33-foot sculpture catalogued merely as ‘JE 46278’ actually depicts Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene - the twin babies of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII.

The revelation comes courtesy of Giuseppina Capriotti, an Egyptologist at the Italy's National Research Council.

Ancient: The sculpture, which was found in 1918, depicts Cleopatra's twins

Stone-cold truth: The 33-foot sculpture was catalogued merely as 'JE 46278'

She described the statue’s unusual looks to Discovery News: ‘It shows two naked children, one male and one female, of identical size standing within the coils of two snakes. Each figure has an arm over the other’s shoulder,‭ ‬while the other hand grasps a serpent.’

She added: ‘Unfortunately the faces are not well preserved, but we can see that the boy has curly hair and a braid on the right side of the head, typical of Egyptian children. The girl’s hair is arranged in a way‬ similar to the so-called ‭m‬elonenfrisur‭ (‬melon coiffure ) an elaborated hairstyle often associated with the Ptolemaic dynasty, and Cleopatra particularly.’

Born in Alexandra in 69BC into a Macedonian Greek dynasty that had ruled Egypt for three centuries, Cleopatra was the last pharaoah of Ancient Egypt, acceding to the throne at just 17 years of age.

It’s said she committed suicide in 30BC by holding an asp to her breast after defeat in the battle of Actium.

She has been immortalised in numerous works of art as well as Shakespeare’s Antony And Cleopatra and the lavish 1963 film Cleopatra, where she was played by Elizabeth Taylor.

The fabled Queen also had a child – Caesarion – with Julius Caesar – and another son, Ptolemy Philadelphus, with Antony.
