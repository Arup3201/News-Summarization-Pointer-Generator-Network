The Border Agency is accused of a massive cover-up to hide the number of people let in to the country under a secret relaxation of immigration controls this summer.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in the House of Commons that 'the shredders are on and there is a ban on internal emails,' as she urged Theresa May to investigate attempts to conceal the scale of the fiasco.

Her claims came as the Home Secretary admitted that we will never know how many terrorists and criminals entered Britain in the latest borders blunder.

Mrs May made the admission yesterday as she explained to MPs her role in the relaxation of controls.

The Home Secretary said she ordered a ‘pilot’ scheme to water down passport checks in July for Britons and other EU nationals – without telling Parliament.

Up to five million foreign nationals may have entered the UK during the downgrade, which applied at every port and airport. It will never be known how many were illegals.

Senior Home Office sources conceded Mrs May agreed to extend the pilot scheme in September – even though she did not know whether it was working properly.

As the Home Secretary prepares to face the Home Affairs Select Committee today, one of the committee's members has criticised her 'shambolic' handling of the affair.

Labour MP Alun Michael, a former Home Office minister, said: 'She didn't answer some very straight questions in the House yesterday.'

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, he added: 'The Home Secretary knew of the deep concern about the Border Agency, and yet there doesn't seem to have been a link between ministers and the chief people, particularly in the border force.'

Suspended: Brodie Clark, the head of the UK Borders Agency, has had the blame for the fiasco placed squarely at his door by Mrs May

Last night a
damaging leaked document also revealed that the rule change was brought
in to cut queues at airports, not for security reasons. Home Office 
sources also admitted Mrs May was kept informed about the original 
scheme.

The scandal is hugely embarrassing 
for the Tories, who campaigned at the election on a platform of reducing
immigration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year, after it soared to more than
a quarter of a million under Labour.

UK
Border Agency boss Brodie Clark was suspended on Thursday after Mrs 
May was told a separate round of additional checks on foreigners from 
outside the EU against a ‘watch list’ had also been suspended at Calais 
as well as some Heathrow fingerprint checks.

But
last night the Public and Commercial Services Union – which represents 
hundreds of Border Agency officials – claimed the fingerprint checks 
were actually scrapped months before the pilot scheme was introduced.

Mrs May’s critics, however, have still to produce ‘smoking gun’ evidence that she knew of Mr Clark’s decision to further water down the checks last summer.

Yesterday Labour disclosed an email – circulated on July 28 – which ordered UKBA staff to ‘cease routinely opening the chip’ in biometric passports from the EU.

Downgraded: An extraordinary document says that staff were told to downgrade the checks to ensure there were no hold ups at airports

Officials were also told to stop ‘routinely checking’ children from the EU ‘against the Warnings Index’, which is designed to weed out possible terrorists and criminal gangs.

And staff were told to not routinely question visa holders from outside the EU on arrival in the UK either – though Home Office officials said this was standard practice.

The Daily Mail first reported on the fiasco in Saturday's edition

Crucially, the document also gave the
green light for the border staff to take ‘further measures’ without 
clearing them with ministers.

Extraordinarily,
the document makes clear that the downgrade in checks was carried out 
to ‘ensure good order in the arrival hall, disruption to flight 
schedules’ and prevent ‘passengers being held on the aircraft’.

That
revelation is particularly damaging for ministers as union chiefs say 
the changes were made because ministers are laying off 5,200 staff as 
part of cut-backs and there aren’t enough staff to handle the volume of 
passengers at peak times.

Announcing
no fewer than three inquiries into the fiasco, the Home Secretary 
insisted the measures were authorised on the basis that they were 
subject to a ‘risk-based assessment’ and not used routinely.

But
that claim was in tatters as Border Agency whistleblowers said 
passport controls were relaxed for half of working shifts at most ports 
of entry and ‘almost round the clock’ at some airports like Luton and 
Stansted.

Mrs May placed 
the blame squarely at the door of Brodie Clark, telling MPs he 
‘authorised the wider relaxation of border controls without ministerial 
sanction’.

The UKBA was at the 
centre of another controversy this summer when it emerged officials 
missed six chances to stop a banned Palestinian activist from entering 
the UK.

Mrs May said an
investigation into how Sheikh Raed Salah was able to enter the UK in 
June despite being banned found 'insufficiently robust processes' led to
six missed chances to intervene overseas, on departure to, and in the 
UK.

‘Indeed I told officials explicitly that the pilot was to go no further than we had agreed,’ she said.

‘As a result of these unauthorised 
actions, we will never know how many people entered the country who 
should have been prevented from doing so after being flagged by the 
Warnings Index.’

Around 100,000 foreign nationals 
enter Britain every day. If the rules were relaxed for half of all 
shifts, it is likely that up to five million foreign nationals entered 
the UK while the weaker rules were in operation.

A
briefing note circulated by Tory whips yesterday urged Conservative MPs
to ask the Home Secretary whether those responsible should be 
prosecuted – effectively agitating for Mr Clark to be charged.

UKBA sources, unions and opposition politicians said it was inconceivable that the Home Office did not know what was going on.

Home Office officials admitted Mrs May did receive an update on the operation of the scheme when she signed off a decision to extend it from mid-September to November.

Aides said she would not have seen the ‘operational instruction’ from Border Agency bosses to frontline staff at ports of entry.

Mrs May was supported by David Cameron, but Downing Street made clear he was only informed about the pilot scheme in recent days ‘when it was apparent that there was a problem’.

Ms Cooper accused Mrs May of ‘doing nothing, even now, to find out and assess who has entered the country and what the security risk might be’.

She added: 'We need to know what pressures officials were put under to cut corners as a result and keep queues down with reduced staff.'
