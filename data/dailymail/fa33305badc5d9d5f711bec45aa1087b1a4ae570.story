Ministry of Defence scientists have been exploring the possible use of Ebola as a biochemical weapon, newly released documents confirm.

Staff at the MoD's research centre at Porton Down, Wiltshire, have been assessing the risk of the virus being used by terrorists such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda to attack the UK.

The documents, released under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that scientists have been looking into at least three potential scenarios

The request from an unnamed source was for Porton Down staff to provide 'guidance on the feasibility and potential impact of a non-state actor exploiting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.'

Three potential scenarios are outlined in the document, marked 'UK secret UK eyes only', although the details are withheld.

No information is provided regarding the first scenario, and the only detail revealed about the second scenario is that it would be both logistically and technically challenging for a non-state group to undertake'.

Following the blacked-out scenario, the team concludes: 'Clearly there are practical issues involved with such a scenario that of themselves are often not insurmountable but taken together add enormously to the complexity of successfully undertaking this attack.'

A third, also heavily redacted, scenario 'constitutes the most technically challenging of the scenarios considered here', The Observer reports.

This comes after yesterday's report  that the nurse who became the first Briton to be diagnosed with Ebola in the UK faces disciplinary action over claims she concealed being unwell when she returned from Africa.

Ebola is virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.  

Ebola spreads via direct contact  with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.

The incubation period is 2 to 21 days, but the humans are not infectious until they develop symptoms. 

First symptoms are the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, headache and sore throat.

This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

Laboratory findings include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.

People remain infectious as long as their blood and body fluids, including semen and breast milk, contain the virus. 

The current outbreak in west Africa is the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976. 

There have been more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. 

There are currently no licensed Ebola vaccines but two potential candidates are undergoing evaluation.

Pauline Cafferkey, who spent almost a month in an isolation unit in London earlier this year while her life hung in the balance, is one of five medics having their 'fitness to practise' assessed by regulators.

According to one unsubstantiated report, a temperature test showed that Ms Cafferkey was over the limit – and others present were aware of it – but the result was not reported.

In theory, if any of the five are judged to have broken professional standards, they could be 'struck off'.  

Last year's outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has been recorded as the worst in known history with 22,894 cases and 9,177 deaths reported around the globe so far.

A majority of confirmed cases have been found in Guinea, Libera and Sierra Leone, with the latter the worst affected, with 10,934 cases to date, according to the World Health Organisation.

The steep decline in case numbers has leveled off over the past month and the development is a cause for concern, the WHO said this week.

The United Nations has said ten times fewer people are being diagnosed with Ebola each week than in September. 

Over the past four weeks, however, the line of the graph has flattened out, with the rate around 120 to 150 new cases a week. 

Health officials have expressed optimism in recent weeks that the tide seems to be turning in the fight against the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. 

The presidents of the three worst affected countries, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, this week said they hope to reduce the number of new cases to zero by April 15. 

MailOnline has contacted the Ministry of Defence for comment.
