Germany is mourning the loss of 'mad millionaire' Klaus Zapf - an eccentric tycoon who worshipped socialism even as capitalism made him filthy rich.

Mr Zapf, who passed away this week at the age of 62 on his third honeymoon, made his fortune in the removals business. His distinctive yellow and blue vans were a constant feature in city streets as they packed up and unloaded wares from across the country and the world.

But he shunned the trappings of wealth. He gave most of his cash away, lived in a £400-a-month rented flat, despised ostentatiousness and shopped at discount supermarket Aldi.

'Mad millionaire' Klaus Zapf has died aged 62 from a heart attack on his third honeymoon. He lived a humble lifestyle despite being a multi-millionaire entrepeneur who made his fortune through his removals business

He planted a statue of his hero Vladimir Lenin next to his Zapf Umzüge company yard in the gritty Kreuzberg section of the city that over four decades became one of the largest removal firms in Europe.

He called his business 'West Berlin's best removals collective,' although in reality he was a dictator - albeit a benevolent one.

'Here the delusions of grandeur are healed every day,' he said of his workplace. 

He loved Berlin but he was no native. Klaus Emil Heinrich Zapf moved to the divided, Cold War city from the Baden town of Eppingen at the start of the 1970s because he did not want to be called up to the army.

West Berlin was unique in Germany at the time in that it allowed young men resident within its boundaries to skip military service.

Consequently it was a magnet for thousands like him. He half-heartedly set about studying law, but admitted that he was more fond of studying pubs and their contents.

To finance his legal ambitions he bought a clapped out old Transit van and began undercutting established removal firms. 

He couldn't drive but found people who could and instead set about the 'hard labour' of shifting the furniture during moves. 

Publicans in particular liked using him. He later claimed they were impressed by his three first names which they thought gave him a status he didn't have.

Soon his 'alternative' removal service became the norm. He bought more vans, moved in squatters and doctors, lawyers and anyone who could afford to pay him - or at least promised to. 

Mr Zapf had an estimated fortune of £10million tied up in the company, but never took more than £300 a month

Mr Zapf's company is known across Europe for its yellow and blue vans. Bizarrely he never learned to drive 

'Zapf Removals - Owned by the Employees,' he boasted, with a logo on the side of his vans that read: 'Mens agitat molem - the spirit moves the mass.'

He charged customers in posher parts of the city, like Dahlem and Zehlendorf, more than those in the working class districts like Wedding and Kreuzberg. He split the money between the workers and himself in true socialist style.

When he died he had an estimated fortune of £10million tied up in the company which has 600 employees. He never drew a salary of more than £300 a month.

Dressed like an American beatnik poet of the 1960s, with a long flowing beard and heavy rimmed black glasses to match, it was not unusual to see him on city streets at night picking up beer bottles out of litter bins so he could reclaim the deposit money.

'I don't need money. It just makes us unequal,' he said in an interview last year. 'There are just so many bloody idiots with money around, you don't need another one.'

Married three times, the latest union in June this year, Mr Zapf was on his honeymoon when he died. 

He never bought a flat because he thought it would only contribute to a price-spiral and leave 'ordinary workers' unable to afford decent housing. But he had a sharp business brain and spotted opportunities to expand the business at every turn.

Mr Zapf set up offices in Berlin, predicting when the Berlin Wall fell that the capital would move back to the city

When the Berlin Wall fell he was certain that the capital would move from sleepy Bonn on the Rhine to Berlin - and he was right. 

So he set up a logistics depot there that paid off handsomely when the politicians and civil servants began their great trek eastwards.

He expanded into overseas removals and opened branch offices across Germany. 

He was described by the media as a 'genial despot' who once said at a shareholders meeting: 'The proletarian elite operates well with me!'

Over the past decade he withdrew more and more from public view. Once a frequengter of SPD - Germany's Labour Party - functions, he preferred to sit instead in the Diener pub, meaning servant, in the Charlottenburg section of the city in the evenings and drink a few beers and talk with actors, painters, journalists and lawyers.

On the question of whether he had a role model, he replied: 'Oh, yes, the main character from the August trilogy by Norwegian Nobel Laureate Knut Hamsun. To do this you need to know: August is a tireless navigator and braggart. And the only truly good human being who thinks unselfishly, not like all the others. He satirized the economic world, which was fine by me.'

He died of a heart attack this week, his second in 14 years. 

In his last interview in February this year he said: 'My last move will be to the cemetery in Eppingen.'

And that is where he will be laid to rest, the funeral attended by his sole daughter aged thirteen, friends, former wives and politicians.
