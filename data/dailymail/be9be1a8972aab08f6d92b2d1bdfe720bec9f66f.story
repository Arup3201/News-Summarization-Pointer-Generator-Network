The slaughter of a British family in the Alps could be linked to money found hidden in a Geneva bank account.

The cash was in the name of Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his dentist wife Iqbal, 47.

The couple died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire that also killed Mr Al-Hilli’s Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, and Sylvain Mollier, a passing cyclist.

Policemen investigate the scene of the murder in the forest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps. Money found in bank accounts belonging to the family has now been seized

The couple’s two young daughters survived the attack, although the elder was seriously injured.

Detectives admitted this week they 
were still baffled by the motive for the attack close to Lake Annecy, in
eastern France, on September 5.

But Swiss prosecutor Dario Zanni is 
working on the theory that the secret bank account is linked with the 
quadruple murder – and that Mr Al-Hilli may have been in a Geneva bank 
shortly before the slaughter.

Last night a source close to the case 
speculated that the ‘sizeable amount of cash’ could provide the key to 
the killings, and that Mr Al-Hilli could even have had large sums of 
money from the account on him when he was killed.

One report from Switzerland suggested that Mr Al-Hilli had visited the bank shortly before he was killed.

Victim: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was murdered near the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie region of France alongside his wife and mother-in-law

Geneva is just an hour’s drive from 
where the massacre took place, in an isolated layby on the outskirts of 
the village of Chevaline.

Mr Zanni, who was appointed by French 
investigators, believes the entire family may have been returning from 
the Swiss city when the ambush took place.

The Al-Hillis were shot repeatedly in 
the head and body as they sat in the family’s BMW. The bank account 
seized in Geneva was once in the name of Mr Al-Hilli’s recently deceased
father, Kadhim.

Mr Al-Hilli has been said to have been involved in a dispute with his elder brother, Zaid, 53, over their father’s will.

While Saad was an engineer on 
satellite and electronics projects, Zaid works for the Burhill Group, a 
golf and leisure company, at its head office in Walton-on-Thames in 
Surrey, close to where he owns a home.

The brothers are joint owners of the 
family home, worth about £1million, in Claygate, Surrey, although Zaid 
moved out about a year ago, around the time their father died in Spain.

A legal document appears to show that Saad had attempted to block the terms of his father’s will being carried out.

And the engineer had told a childhood 
friend he had cut links with his older brother after ‘underhand things’ 
took place over their late father’s estate,

The family is said to be worth many millions, with reports of further properties in Spain, France and Iraq.

Zaid has not spoken publicly about the
tragedy but has been interviewed by police on a number of occasions, 
each time denying he was in dispute with his brother.

Poignant: Cyclists ride past flowers left at the scene of the killing outside the nearby village of Chevaline

Concern: The Al-Hilli's home in Claygate, Surrey. Speculation still surrounds the motive for the shootings in which three members of the family died

It has emerged that colour photographs
showing the Al-Hillis minutes before the attack have been found by 
detectives inside the family’s BMW.

All were taken in front of a picturesque house covered in flowers outside Doussard, a town close to the village of Chevaline.

The Al-Hillis’ four-year-old daughter, Zeena, survived the attack unscathed after hiding under her mother’s corpse.

Her seven-year-old sister, Zainab, was badly injured, suffering serious head injuries and a bullet wound in a shoulder.

According to others who have seen the 
photographs, dates and times are shown, meaning they can be placed in a 
series of events which ended up with the quadruple murder.

Detectives fear all were drawn into a suspected ambush by one or more professional hitmen on the outskirts of Chevaline.

As 100 officers on both sides of the 
Channel struggle with the case, Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud said on 
Thursday: ‘We’re investigating everything but it all takes a lot of 
time, trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have 
died.’
