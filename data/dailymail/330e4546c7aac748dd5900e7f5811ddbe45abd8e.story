The owner of Moonlite BunnyRanch - Nevada's most famous legal brothel - describes getting a kiss from Marilyn Monroe and his desire to reclaim the word pimp from its negative connotations in his memoir, The Art of the Pimp. 

Dennis Hof, 68, has become the object of desire for budding 18- to 21-year-old prostitutes through creating a sense of camaraderie in the word 'pimp'. 

At BunnyRanch, which is featured on HBO's late-night reality show Cathouse, he created a brothel where women could set their own prices and deals but still split earnings with the house.

Brothel: Dennis Hof, owner of Moonlight BunnyRanch, writes in his new memoir of his run-in with Marilyn Monroe and includes first-hand accounts from ex-girlfriends that show what it was like to be with a pimp

Life story: Hof, 68, opened his brothel in Lyon County, Nevada, in the early 1990s. His goal was to train prostitutes in investing, sales and negotiating prices for sexual favors

Hof starts his memoir with the story of how he got his first erection - something he can thank Marilyn Monroe for, according to the New York Post. 

He was an eight-year-old boy at the Arizona State Fair when he saw a 'gorgeous, red-lipped blonde' waving at him while filming a movie. 

She kissed him on the cheek and introduced herself as Marilyn Monroe. And from then on, Hof sought out young, voluptuous blondes to fill his fantasies. 

He didn't start out in the brothel industry, however. He owned five gas stations in the early 1970s, but during the gas shortage of 1972, he began a deal with a local massage parlor: He set aside gas for the women so he could use their services whenever he liked. 

'I had always enjoyed sex, sure,' he writes, 'but until [then] I hadn't realized how little I knew about it. So, of course I kept going back, a willing student... I soon realized I had a big problem: I loved f****** and I couldn't get enough of it.'

And he then realized that he 'had fallen madly in love with prostitutes'. 

He moved into real estate and became a regular at the Moonlight Ranch brothel in Mound House Nevada. And when it went up for sale in the early 1990s, he bought it for $1million in Lyon County, one of the only counties that still allows legal prostitution.  

He changed the business's name to 'Dennis Hof's World Famous Moonlite BunnyRanch' and trained all of the women in investing, sales and negotiating prices for sexual favors. 

Entertaining read: The Art of The Pimp will be released for sale on March 17. In the book he describes 'one man's search for love, sex, and money'

Smart money: Hof made sure the prostitutes were independent contractors who could refuse any act or customer. Earnings are split between the women and the house

All the women: Hof started dating prostitutes after realizing monogamy wasn't for him. He made sure all the women were aware that he was having sex with others

Hof made sure the prostitutes were independent contractors who could refuse any act or customer.  

But after realizing monogamous relationships weren't for him, he decided to date exclusively prostitutes and made them all aware of his lack of interest in seeing only one woman. 

According to him, however, all relationships ended when the women found out he was having sex with other women. 

Hof seems to have a realization when during a recent conversation he had with his best friend, porn star Ron Jeremy.

'It's not enough to be a good guy, and it's not enough to buy them s***, and it's not enough to teach them how to make serious money. You have to give them your heart and soul. If you hold back, even a little bit, they know it, and it kills them.'.

'For f***'s sake, Dennis,' Jeremy said. 'You sound like a girl!'

In parts of his memoir he allows people to write pages of their experiences with him, including working girls Krissy Summers and Cami Parker.

Summers's account of their relationship explains the first time they met in person, after corresponding online for years, starting when she was a college freshman.

Narcissist: During a first-hand account of being in a relationship with Hof, Cami Parker says that he tried to change the way she looked constantly, because 'everyone knows Dennis likes skinny little-girl bodies'

'I walked in and he said, "Hi, I'm Dennis Hof,"' she writes. 'And I remember thinking, "I know who you are." And then he said, "Take off your pants." That was it. "Take off your pants." I was absolutely terrified. Dennis was only the second man I'd ever been with.'

Parker calls Hof a 'soulless pimp' and explains the first time she arrived at the ranch, aged 22, after seeing Hof on the Tyra Banks show. 

When the girls met her they told her, 'Daddy's gonna love you!' and asked if she would have sex with Hof. 

'Well, you want Daddy to like you. You won't have a very good time if he doesn't, so if he wants you to, you definitely should,' the women told her.

Parker ended up in a relationship with Hof, but he tried changing the way she looked consistently.

She entered the ranch as a 5ft 4in, 107lb woman with A-cup breasts. But Hof would 'forever tell me to lose weight', and she hit '96 pounds with DDs', which 'led to a very serious - and nearly deadly - eating disorder. Everyone knows Dennis likes skinny, little-girl bodies'. 

Hof eventually broke up with her - through another girl at the ranch - because she was 'too old for him'. She was 23, while Hof was 65.

Psychotherapist Dr. Sheenah Hankin writes a scathing review of Hof, claiming he 'encourages them to be jealous and yearn for his attention' while laughing at 'how they bicker, bitch and fight with each other over him'.

'Dennis uses the women he "loves" for his own desires, loyal companionship and sex,' writes Hankin. 'Like any pimp, he exploits them. This is sadistic behavior, and it is both unrecognized and denied.' 

She calls him a narcissist, with 'no empathy', who's 'clueless about his lover’s hurts and fears or his part in creating them'.
