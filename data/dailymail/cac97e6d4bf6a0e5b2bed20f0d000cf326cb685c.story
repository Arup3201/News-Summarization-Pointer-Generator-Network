A teenager who is facing charges of murdering his mother and younger brother made his first appearance in court today.

Adrian Navarro-Canales, 16, from the Las Vegas area, was shackled on Monday in Henderson Justice Court, Nevada, and nodded to signal that he understood the double-homicide charges against him.

He said little else as a Henderson justice of the peace scheduled a preliminary hearing for October 30.

The prosecutor and the teen's appointed public defender did not comment outside court, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

He is being tried as an adult and could face a possible life-sentence if found guilty. He cannot be given the death penalty due to his age.

Henderson police found the bodies of Elvira Canales-Gomez, 40, and 9-year-old Cesar Navarro on September 20 in the bathroom of their apartment on the 11000 block of S. Eastern Ave. near Sunridge Heights Parkway.

Navarro-Canales was sought for several days before he was found on September 25 sitting alone in a food court on the Las Vegas strip.

The teen was first sought as a possible victim but was then named as the prime suspect in the slayings.

An
unidentified tipster who recognised Navarro-Canales from media 
reports told Henderson police the 16-year-old was at the food court at 
the Showcase mall, police spokesman Keith Paul said.

Navarro-Canales offered no resistance when police approached him at about 10:30am.

'He was sitting at a table,' Paul said. 'The two detectives walked up to him and took him into custody.'

Navarro-Canales
was booked into juvenile detention at the Clark County Detention Center
in downtown Las Vegas to await today's initial court appearance.

Paul said investigators think 
Navarro-Canales walked the 9 miles to the Strip from the suburban 
apartment where the bloody bodies of his mother and brother had been found.

They don't believe he returned to the apartment, and they were still trying to determine where he had been staying.

Canales-Gomez's
niece, Ana Martinez, 23, told investigators her cousin didn't have any 
friends that she knew of in the Las Vegas area, didn't like living in 
the United States and wanted to go back to Mexico.

She described 
Navarro-Canales as anti-social and said he spent most of his time in the
apartment playing video games.

The
mall, next to the MGM Grand casino-resort, is marked by giant M&M 
and Coca-Cola displays, several shoe and apparel retailers, and an 
eight-plex movie theater. It also features a video arcade.

Navarro-Canales was enrolled as a junior
at Coronado High School in Henderson but hadn't attended classes since 
school began in August, Clark County School District spokeswoman Melinda
Malone said.

The
bodies were discovered in the bathroom of their Henderson apartment 
three days after detectives believe they were killed on September 17.

Canales-Gomez still had a butcher's knife lodged in her chest, police 
said.

Navarro-Canales
was nowhere to be found, and police had been searching for six days in 
Nevada and surrounding states as well as the Mexican border for the 
teen.

Henderson police investigators think 
the killings happened Tuesday, but the bodies weren't discovered until 
Friday — the fourth time a relative and the mother's boyfriend called to
say they were worried about whether he, Elvira Canales-Gomez and Cesar 
Navarro were OK.

Henderson police spokesman Keith Paul said officers 'found no cause to break in' during the first three visits.

'On Friday, we had family members saying they tried several times to contact (Canales-Gomez) and couldn't reach her,' he said.

Search: Police had launched a national manhunt for Adrian Navarro-Canales, pictured, in Nevada, surrounding states and the Mexican border. He was found Wednesday after a tip off

A
Henderson police officer fetched a key from property managers and was 
hit as he entered the apartment by the pungent smell of decomposing 
bodies, the police report said.

The
mom was found dead on the bathroom floor with multiple stab wounds and 
Cesar, 9, was found in the bathtub. He had been stabbed once.

Adrian Navarro-Canales — who 
celebrated his 16th birthday on September 16 with his mother, brother 
and mother's boyfriend at the apartment — was missing.

Paul said investigators think Navarro-Canales acted alone.

Despite being
a minor, Navarro-Canales has been named because of the seriousness of 
the crime and to assist in the manhunt for him, which has now come to a close.

The police spokesman said 
Navarro-Canales' name had been entered in a national crime database and 
authorities on the Mexico border had been notified during the search.

The police report said the teen's 
passport and border documents were found in the apartment in the quiet 
complex off Eastern Avenue and Sunridge Heights Parkway.

The mother's 
vehicle was found parked outside.

Police went to the apartment 
on September 18 and twice on September 19 — after calls from 
Canales-Gomez's boyfriend, Carlos Rubio-Villanueva, and the niece.

Paul 
said officers found the front door locked and windows secure.

Killed: According to the police report, investigators think the mother and boy were stabbed to death September 17, after Canales-Gomez, pictured, drove home from work about 3:40 p.m.

According
to the police report, investigators think the mother and boy were 
stabbed to death September 17, after Canales-Gomez drove home from work 
about 3:40 p.m., and Cesar was last seen at school.

Police said Navarro-Canales might have stayed in the apartment at least one night before fleeing.

Rubio-Villanueva
told investigators he noticed a kitchen light was off when he visited 
the apartment late September 17; when he stopped on his way to work 
Wednesday afternoon and summoned Henderson police to the apartment.

The light was
off again when he checked after work shortly before midnight on Wednesday.

Police
said it appeared Navarro-Canales texted his father the day after the killing, 
telling him the others were fine and couldn't talk because they were 
asleep.

The
teen's father, Adrian Navarro Soto-Mayor, flew from San Jose, 
California, to Las Vegas and issued a plea in Spanish for his 
son to contact him or other family members.
