The world's most expensive cocktail went on sale in London yesterday - costing the same as a new family car at almost £9,000.

Called Gigi's (pronounced 'gee-gees') the cocktail is aimed at the loaded frequenters of Mayfair, where properties regularly fetch more than £40million.

It was created especially for singer Grace Jones at the star-studded opening of Gigi's restaurant as the owners wanted to give her special thanks for attending.

A flute is filled with a vintage Champagne and an ultra-rare Armagnac that pre-dates the Boer War with the result described as 'liquid gold'.

The price is £8,888, which is equivalent to a brand new Mitsubishi Mirage, a Rolex Submariner, or renting a private jet to fly a family of five to the Mediterranean and back.

A  regular Champagne glass holds 150mls, so even if they fill it to the brim that's £60 per 1ml.

Due to the fact it contains some of the most expensive Champagnes and cognacs on the open market, the drink 'must be paid for in advance' to prevent the 'rather embarrassing' situation where a patron's debit or credit card is declined. 

Gigi's manager adds a sliver of gold leaf to the cocktail with an eye-watering price tag

Makers claim the Gigi's drink tops the world's most expensive tipples - beating Melbourne's £8,167 Winston into second place.

Restaurant manager Cesare Papagna said he wanted to give the iconic film star something 'truly special' to mark the occasion and used two of his most expensive drinks.

The Gigi's has the appearance of a traditional Champagne cocktail which usually includes bubbly laced with cognac and bitters. But unlike them it is made with a bottle of 1990 vintage Cristal and a bottle of 1888 Samalens Vieille Relique Vintage Bas Armagnac.

It also has 'lashings' of gold leaf to give it extra bling. Only the Angostura Bitters and sugar are bought 'off the shelf'.

The cocktail's hefty price tag includes the market value of each full bottle of alcohol, which will produce approximately 12 flute servings worth £708 per glass - or about £177 per glug based on four large mouthfuls.

Cesare said: 'We did not set out to create a cocktail for the fabulously rich but rather to give Ms Jones something memorable to thank her for coming.

'The taste was magnificent, as you would imagine.'

He said the Gigi's - described as tasting 'like liquid gold' - will not be added to the restaurant's drinks menu but will be available to other 'discerning' guests from today.

He added: 'The Gigi's isn't the kind of cocktail that you display on a blackboard - if you have to ask the price, you won't be able to afford it.'  

The price is £8,888, which is equivalent to a brand new Mitsubishi Mirage or a Rolex Submariner

It held the crown for world's most expensive cocktail for little over 18 months, but it's now been beaten to the top spot.

With a dash of Grand Marnier, a soupçon of Chartreuse, a hefty dose of cognac and a dash of Angostura Bitters, the Winston cocktail at Melbourne's Club 23 sounds like a delicious treat for liqueur fans.

But there's a catch that might just make patrons choke on their drink: it costs a staggering £8,167.

The hefty price tag is thanks to the ultra-luxe ingredients, which include Grand Marnier Quintessence and Chartreuse Vieillissement Exceptionnellement Prolonge.

Most expensive of the lot is the 1858 Croizet cognac, which costs £99,000 a bottle.

The cocktail is served with garnishes that include chocolate nutmeg dust, poppy seed essence, rose essence and a little coconut.

Along with deep pockets, those who wish to sample the cocktail will need to place their orders well before they arrive, as the drink takes two days to make, thanks to the labour intensive garnish.
