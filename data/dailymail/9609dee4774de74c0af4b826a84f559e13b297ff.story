A baby boy who was born with his bowel on the outside of his body has finally been allowed home after spending his first three months in hospital.

Joshua O’Callaghan, from Widnes, Merseyside, was born five weeks in November last year.

His mother Lynsey, 26, was told at her 12-week scan that there was potentially something wrong with her baby, but the extent of Joshua’s condition was not discovered until he was born.

Joshua was rushed to the operating table for emergency surgery and had to spend his first months in intensive care as he recovered.

He was finally allowed home to Lynsey and his father John Rankin, 30, in February and was christened last week.

‘When he was born I could tell by the look my mum’s face that Joshua wasn’t right,’ said his mother, a shop worker, who already had another son Jackson, two, from a previous relationship.

‘It was such a shock to see my baby in that state. We were allowed a quick cuddle before he was whisked off to the intensive care unit.

‘Throughout our stay in hospital it was just one thing after another. It’s fantastic to finally get him home and start living as a normal family with Jackson and my partner John’s daughter Courtney.’

Acting fast: Little Joshua was just two days old when doctors rushed him into emergency surgery to treat his condition

Shock: Lynsey was told early in the pregnancy that something might be wrong with Joshua but did not know the full extent of his condition until he was born

Hope: Joshua was given two stomas in surgery, seen in the picture, and a colostomy bag, and his parents were told he would recover within two weeks

Joshua was suffering from a condition called Gastroschisis - a type of hernia - which affects around one in 2,000 births.

This meant he was born with his bowel trapped in his umbilical cord.

He was just two days old when he had emergency surgery to place his organs back inside his body.

His mother said: ‘It was very scary. My tiny baby was surrounded by wires and machines all the time.

‘We thought after the surgery it would take him two weeks to recover and then we would have him home - but it didn’t work like that.’

Joshua was given two stomas - openings on the abdomen which allow stools and urine to exit the body - and a colostomy bag,.

His parents were promised he would be better by his first birthday.

Family: Despite the second operation and a longer recovery time, Lynsey and John have been told their son will go on to live a normal life

However, a short while later, his stomas became blocked and Joshua was rushed in for more surgery. He was finally allowed home last month.

Despite being five months old, Joshua still weighs just 10lb, but no longer has a colostomy bag, and is expected to live a normal life.

His mother said: ‘Some women get chance to enjoy their pregnancy, but not me. Knowing from 12 weeks that there was going to be something wrong with my baby made it hell.

‘Now we’ve finally got him home I can concentrate on making up for that.’

A spokesperson from the Luey Jacob Sharp Foundation, the UK’s only Gastroschisis charity said: ‘It is usually picked up by week 14 in the pregnancy and is a condition for which the cause is unknown, yet seems to be on the rise.

‘Awareness for the condition needs to be raised to achieve prevention. We would also like to campaign for care of pregnant mothers carrying gastro babies.’
