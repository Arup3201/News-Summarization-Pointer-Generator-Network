£110 fine: Mark Buckley has been allowed to go and live on a yacht in Greece after paying off a community order

A drink-driver has been allowed by a court to go and live on a luxury yacht in Greece after paying off a community order in the same way as Carlos Tevez.

Mark Buckley, 34, agreed to pay a paltry fine of £110 instead of serving the rest of his sentence.

His lawyer Kieran Henry cited the case of Argentina striker Tevez, who last month paid a £3,000 fine to avoid the rest of his 250-hour community service order for motoring offences so that he could leave Manchester City and join Italian club Juventus.

Mr Henry told Stockport magistrates that ‘what goes for the rich, goes for the poor’ and suggested that the two cases could  lead to many more court punishments being ‘swapped’ because they are inconvenient.

Mr Henry said: ‘What happened with Carlos Tevez could open the floodgates. Maybe people with  minor issues could get orders revoked on the grounds of ill-health or change of residence.’

Buckley, from Reddish, near Manchester, was stopped in his Citroën C2 in nearby Bredbury on May 16.

A breath test found he had 94 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath – almost three times the legal limit.

On May 29, he admitted drink-driving and Stockport magistrates sentenced him to a six-month community order – including alcohol rehabilitation and a supervision requirement.

They also imposed a two-year driving ban and ordered him to pay £85 costs.

On Tuesday, however, they agreed with Buckley’s plea that he should not have to serve the community order because he wants to live with his parents on their yacht moored off a Greek island.

The community punishment was withdrawn, with magistrates ruling that the order was ‘revoked in the interests of justice’.

Mr Henry said: ‘The magistrate said it was an unusual application.

‘I mentioned the Tevez case in  the hearing and said, “If you can  do it for the rich, it can be done for the poor”.

‘What a case like that does is heighten the profile of something that is already there, but not been used in a while.

'The Tevez case opened up a window of opportunity for people like my client to exercise the court’s discretion.

Precedent: Mr Buckley's lawyer Kieran Henry told Stockport magistrates that 'what goes for the rich, goes for the poor'

'His mum was prepared to take him to Greece and thought it was better for him to be abroad without an order, away from influences making him drink.’

The basis for the defence is that the defendant is not responsible in law for their inability to comply with  the order. It is only used on rare occasions and has to be paid for privately because it is not available on legal aid.

However, Mr Henry said: ‘It is a defence I would consider using again if a client approached me and asked me to. It is being used more often now due to the Tevez case as people know it is available to them.’

In April, Tevez, 29, was banned from driving for six months and ordered to do community service after he admitted driving while disqualified and without insurance.

Tevez completed only 28 hours of his punishment, which he was carrying out at Macclesfield’s Community Garden Centre, where he helped adults with learning difficulties.

Last month, District Judge Bridget Knight, sitting at Macclesfield magistrates’ court, accepted that there were circumstances beyond Tevez’s control in his inability to fulfil the terms of the order.

She said: ‘This is only a technical breach. It is not, I repeat not, a case of a footballer thumbing his nose at a court order.’

It is thought Tevez’s legal team argued that because he was sold by Manchester City, he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order.

Tevez is believed to have been earning £250,000 a week with Manchester City, making his £3,000 fine the equivalent of half an hour’s work.
