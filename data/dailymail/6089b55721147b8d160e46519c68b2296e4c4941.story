Outspoken politician Fred Nile has compared childcare centres to day orphanages just one week after he caused outrage when he said the only man in the Sydney siege was the gunman.

Reverend Nile, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, tweeted: 'Stay-at-home parenting is superior to 'day orphanages' (childcare). We need to reform our tax/welfare system to support parenting #teamnile.'

While some have taken offence to his comments, Rev Nile argued it was a key election promise from his party, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Outspoken politician Fred Nile has compared childcare centres to day orphanages just one week after he caused outrage after the saying the only man in the Sydney siege was the gunman 

While some have taken offence to his comments, Rev Nile argued it was a key election promise from his party

'We favour mother care rather than childcare. We prefer children are cared for by their parents, and there should be financial assistance for stay-at-home mothers,' he said. 

'A lot of things children learn they learn from their parents, they learn from their mothers.' 

He again defended his stance again on Wednesday, tweeting: 'More childcare places & job vacancies would be created if stay-at-home parenting was a viable option'.

David O'Byrne, the national secretary of United Voice - the union representing childcare workers - told Daily Mail Australia Rev Nile's comments were 'offensive'.

'He is breathtakingly ignorant about the role childcare plays,' Mr O'Byrne said. 

'This outdated view that only women care for children in the home is offensive to early year educators and it's offensive to women and families. 

'The guy really does not reflect the values of our communities... and he does not understand the needs and aspirations of families wanting to give their children the best start in life.

'He should take his role more responsibly as a member of parliament.'

Reverend Nile argued on live television that the male hostages who fled the Sydney siege should not receive bravery awards

It comes just a week after people called for Rev Nile to resign after saying on live television the only 'man' inside the Lindt Cafe siege in December was the gunman.  

The Christian Democrat MLC told Sunrise: 'Usually men try to protect the women but it looks like the men were trying to protect their own skins.

'Where were the men? The only 'man' really there was the man with the gun.' 

Asked about his remarks in an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Rev. Nile said he 'misspoke'. 

'I wanted to say he was a cowardly man. I left the word cowardly out. 

'(He was) hiding behind the shotgun. I was certainly not complimenting him.' 

'Even the men who fled leaving women behind': This tweet posted by Fred Nile's team sparked controversy earlier this week. He later expanded on his remarks in an interview with Fairfax Radio

In a follow-up tweet, he said: 'The terrorist was a coward. The real Man was the man WRESTLING with the gun.'

Rev Nile also sparked controversy when he declared that the men who fled the Lindt cafe in Martin Place after being held hostage should not receive bravery awards.

Two people, barrister Katrina Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson, were killed after the 17 hour siege on December 15.  

Mr Nile told Fairfax Radio earlier this month that Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson should be the only hostages given awards.

He said he didn't think the other hostages should receive bravery awards. 

'Maybe they could have done something more to protect the women.

'Normally bravery awards are given for an act of bravery - that somebody actually does something. They haven't done anything.' 

Mr Nile also argued that it would only lessen the worth of bravery awards to provide them to those male hostages who fled.
