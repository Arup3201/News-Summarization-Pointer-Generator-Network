Ministers have pledged to close a ‘nonsense’ anomaly that has seen more than 5,000 children – some as you as 11 – banned from driving even though they are not yet old enough to legally drive.

Alerted to the scandal exposed by their own figures,  Ministers promised to act to crack down on what they admit is a serious threat to road safety.

In total some 5,333 under-age driving offenders have been ‘banned’ from driving since 2009 - including five 11-year-olds - analysis of Government figures obtained from a Freedom of Information request to the DVLA by motoring magazine Auto Express.

Presented with the alarming data by Mailonline, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘This strikes me as a nonsense and I will be talking to my colleagues at the Department for Transport about this.’

Roads Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘I agree that this sounds like nonsense and an anomaly. I will be looking at this urgently.

‘We are fully committed to keeping Britain’s roads among the safest in the world and this means taking a tough line on anyone who breaks the law regardless of age.

‘Young drivers already face sanctions – 
under current legislation disqualifications are endorsable offences, 
which means points can be carried onto provisional licences and used by 
courts under the totting up system for future bans.

‘I will take a careful look at 
circumstances where very young drivers whose points or disqualifications
have become spent before they are eligible to drive to make sure they 
are effectively dealt with.’

The AA said the law must be changed 
so that  most serious and prolific offenders should face an extended 
driving test and be subject to social reports before they can take their
first test. And offenders banned for a period that goes over their 17th
birthday should not be eligible to take the test.

AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ‘It is good that the government has been stirred to look at this. 
‘I think the average motorist will be horrified by these figures. 
Motoring lawlessness is a real problem in this country, Thankfully only a
small minority of young people behave in this way.’

For the future he stressed: ’Prolific
and repeat child offenders should have these offences  etched into 
their driving record and have them taken into account should they ever 
commit an offence after the age of 17.

‘The most serious offenders should 
face an extended driving test and be subject to social reports before 
they can take a proper test at 17.  And offenders banned for a period 
that goes over their 17th birthday should not be eligible to have a 
licence  unless they too take  an extended test with social reports.’

Mr Watters added: ‘It might be better 
for the original under-age  bans to be suspended and subject to being 
re-invoked – but not automatically – if the they re-offend after the age
of 17.’

The Ministry of Justice confirmed that currently young people convicted of  driving offences will be  subject to penalty points and disqualification even if they are not yet old enough to hold a driving licence, and that the bans come into force from the time they are imposed by a court, rather than from the age when the offender reaches driving age.
