Back-row forward Julien Bardy will answer a charge of striking England No 8 Billy Vunipola with his knee in Clermont's 30-23 defeat at Saracens on Saturday.

The 29-year-old will appear before a European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) disciplinary panel in Dublin on Thursday.

Bardy is alleged to have struck Saracens loose forward Vunipola with his knee in the 78th minute of the Champions Cup Pool One match at Allianz Park.

Saracens eased past Clermont in north London to open their cup campaign with a hugely-creditable victory.

Mark McCall's men thrashed Clermont 46-6 in the semi-finals of last year's Heineken Cup, with Chris Ashton claiming a brace of tries at Twickenham in April.

The England wing helped himself to two more against the same opponents at the weekend, with back-three partner David Strettle claiming a double for himself as Saracens climbed to the top of Pool One.

Match citing commissioner John Charles brought the charge against Bardy, while Simon Thomas has been appointed as the independent judicial officer for Thursday's hearing.

Bardy will face a minimum three-week ban if found guilty, while mid-range punishments start at eight weeks and top-end sanctions open at three months.
