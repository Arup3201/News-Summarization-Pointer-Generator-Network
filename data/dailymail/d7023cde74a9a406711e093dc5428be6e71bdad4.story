President Barack Obama's 'flippant dismissal of the Constitution' is 'utterly beneath the dignity of the office,' House Speaker John Boehner said in a op-ed on Sunday explaining why the House is suing the president.

'I know the President is frustrated. I'm frustrated. The American people are frustrated, too,' Boehner wrote on CNN.

But that irritation doesn't give the president the right to enact his own laws, the Republican leader argued.

'That's why, later this 
month, we will bring legislation to the House floor that would authorize
 the House of Representatives to file suit in an effort to compel 
President Obama to follow his oath of office and faithfully execute the 
laws of our country.'

House Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans are taking Obama to court. Boehner is pictured here last month at the press conference

When Republicans took over the House in 2011, the first-term Democratic president and Republican congressman embraced the split party control over Congress and pledged to work together to resolve the issues plaguing the nation.

As a display of his willingness to work with and not against Republicans, the president even allowed the newly minted House Speaker to play golf with him, an invite usually reserved for close friends and aides.

Boehner and Obama's once friendly relationship has deteriorated throughout the past four years, however, as the president has grown increasingly impatient with the opposing party's reluctance to pass bills addressing his favored issues.

With no end in sight to congressional gridlock, and the final term of his presidency nearly half way over, Obama has taken on a more aggressive approach to moving forward his legislative agenda, using executive orders to make reforms when and where he sees fit.

The president says he has only used powers afforded to him as the country's executive to make changes to administration policies.

Republicans claim only Congress has the authority to make changes to U.S. laws, however, and the president is playing fast and loose with the Constitution.

In a memo to fellow members of Congress last month, Boehner said Obama is in violation of Article II Section III of the Constitution, which says the president 'shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'

'Under the Constitution’s separation of powers principle, only the Legislative Branch has the power to legislate,' Boehner wrote.

'On one matter after another during his presidency, President Obama has circumvented the Congress through executive action, creating his own laws and excusing himself from executing statutes he is sworn to enforce – at times even boasting about his willingness to do it, as if daring the America people to stop him.

'On matters ranging from health care and energy to foreign policy and education, President Obama has repeatedly run an end-around on the American people and their elected legislators, straining the boundaries of the solemn oath he took on Inauguration Day,' the Speaker of the House continued.

In response to Boehner's lawsuit the president definitely told ABC's George Stephanopolous, 'I'm not going to apologize for trying to do something while they're doing nothing.'

A few days later he mockingly told Republicans who think he's acting outside the law: 'So sue me.'

In an op-ed that appeared on CNN's website over the weekend, Boehner took on the president's comment, calling his behavior 'disappointing.' He also defended House Republicans' record, saying they'd passed more than 40 bills aimed at creating jobs that have died in the Senate, along with other House-led legislation.

'I don't take the House 
legal action against the President lightly. We've passed legislation to 
address this problem (twice), but Senate Democrats, characteristically, 
have ignored it,' Boehner wrote.

'There must be accountability,' he said. 'When there are conflicts like this -- between the legislative
 branch and the executive branch -- it is my view that it is our 
responsibility to stand up for this institution in which we serve, and 
for the Constitution.'

Boehner's lawsuit is perfectly timed to coincide with a previously scheduled congressional recess that will last from the first week of August through the first week in September. 

While the president and Democrats are out campaigning against Republican obstructionism, Republicans will be able to use the certain-to-pass suit as proof of the president's malfeasance.

Republicans are expected to keep the House after this year's elections, but there's still four months on the clock. The president plans to actively campaign for his party in the coming weeks and is making trips to both Colorado and Texas for fundraising events this week.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also pledged to come out for Democrats this fall after she finishes her book tour this month. Clinton still enjoys a high approval rating, and candidates who receive the potential 2016 candidate's public support could see a bump in the polls.

President Obama says Republicans in Congress are keeping vital legislation from becoming laws and so he must go around Congress to make reforms himself

Boehner and his Republican colleagues say the president doesn't have the authority to change laws passed by Congress, and in doing so, he is violating the Constitution

The House is now suing the president for what it sees as lawless behavior, and the president doesn't seem to care

The president's nonchalant attitude about the House's suit stuck a nerve with Boehner, and the House Speaker took the president on over the weekend in an op-ed
