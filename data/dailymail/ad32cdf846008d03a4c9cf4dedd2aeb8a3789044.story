On New Year's Eve two years ago Glamsquad
 co-founder Victoria Eisner was preparing for a party. She ordered 
dinner to her home using Seamless, rented a dress via Rent the Runway, 
and booked a car using Uber. The one thing she couldn't outsource from 
her phone? Hair and make-up.

Glamsquad
 aims to fix that. Book an appointment using their free 
iPhone app, and a professional hairstylist will be on your doorstep in 
an hour with all the equipment needed to create the perfect blow-out. 
They'll set up anywhere with an outlet and all they ask is that you wash
 your hair beforehand for easy styling.

It seemed too good to be true, so, on behalf of Femail, I decided to put the service to the test.

The perfect blow-out: Taylor's stylist Crystle arrived at her apartment promptly at 7.30am - and in just 45 minutes, had transformed her damp, straight hair (left) into a waterfall of curls (right)

I had imagined that the construction of a pop-up salon
 in a New York City shoebox apartment would be overwhelming, but in reality it is anything but.

My stylist, Crystle, 
arrived promptly at 7.30am like a Mary Poppins of hair care and within three minutes of arrival, she was looping and smoothing my hair
 with a blow dryer. Between sectioning off pieces she dispensed helpful 
styling tips, and explained how certain products can help or harm a 
style. 

'A little volumizing mousse is good!' I learned, 'but don’t tease
 your roots.'

After fully drying and pinning my usually poker-straight hair into curls, she doubled back with a curling iron for 
extra hold. All products and tools she used were salon quality - I 
winced at the sight of my own $12 metal curler in the corner.

Finally, she gave my 
hair a quick spritz of hairspray, shook my head back, and turned me 
toward the mirror. I was completely astounded by the results. In just 45 minutes she had transformed my damp, straight hair into a waterfall of 
curls - barely the time it takes me to get ready.

Easy: The effortless booking process is largely thanks to the app, which features a menu of ten hairstyles including an up-do, two braided looks, and several other options aimed at accommodating different hair types

By the time I took my
 eyes off the mirror, she had packed back up her things and gave me a 
warm hug goodbye. 

'Some women are nervous to let a stylist 
into their home because they don't want to create a mess,' Crystle explained, 'so we try to make it as easy as possible. We don't 
leave you with any clean-up.'

Given this hyper-efficiency, the service is already proving popular among new moms. Mothers can quickly schedule a Glamsquad blowout during a child's nap time (my roommate slept soundly through my 
entire appointment), or squeeze it in between play dates.

Glamsquad stylists will also happily travel to your office for a blow-out between meetings.

'We definitely have a strong group of business professionals who are dedicated to the service,' Victoria says. 'High powered women can get Glamsquad dry styling in the privacy of their office before a big meeting or important business lunch.

'Just as some women book their exercise classes online, they book a Glamsquad appointment three times a week. It’s one less thing to worry about.'

The effortless booking process is largely thanks to the app, which features a menu of ten hairstyles
 including an up-do, two braided looks, and several other options aimed 
at accommodating different hair types. Basic blowouts cost $50 (plus a 
20 per cent tip), braids are $75 and up-dos start at $85.

'From the very beginning we wanted to 
make this an app because it’s for an on-the-go women,' co-founder and 
executive chairman Jason Perri told MailOnline.

'It’s for the busy woman who needs a last
 minute blowout, or needs to get ready in a pinch for a last minute 
date. We wanted to make booking and payment easy to use on your phone.'

But quality is not lost in the name of efficiency, says Giovanni Vaccaro,
 a former senior stylist at Frederic Fekkai and current Glamsquad 
creative director.

'As we roll this out it will be as seamless in LA as in New York. We consider ourselves a real urban delivery business'

'We
 want to make it a personalized celebrity type of service. This is not a
 factory environment, all our looks are very wearable, never too 
overdone and coiffed,' he told MailOnline. 'Glamsquad stylists come with
 talent and many years in the industry, we do not hire stylists straight
 out of beauty school.'

Though the company currently only‬ operates in New York, they hope to expand to other urban areas such as Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago, and even London. Glamsquad also plans to offer a make-up service and perhaps even other beauty fixes.‬

'Our technology is very scalable,' says Jason. 'Geolocation and dynamic booking allow us to get to your door in just over an hour's time, so as we roll this out it will be as seamless in LA as in New York. We consider ourselves a real urban delivery business.'

Victoria added that she is surprised that this concept didn't exist before.

'If we can make getting ready much easier people will have more time and fun and that’s our mission,' she says. As one stylist put it, 'Good hair does everything. You can put on a track suit, but if your hair and make-up look great, you'll look like a star.'
