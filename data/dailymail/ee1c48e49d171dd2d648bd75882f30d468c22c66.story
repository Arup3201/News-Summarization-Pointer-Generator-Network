A four-wheel drive has collided with a freight train, causing it to be dragged along the train tracks for more than a kilometre. 

A 23-year-old man driving a four-wheel drive was following a friend through bushland as they both tried to cross the Adelaide to Darwin rail line, 315 kilometres south of Darwin, in the Northern Territory at 1am on Sunday.

The area that the young men drove over was a 'non-designated crossing', according to Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen.  

A four-wheel drive has collided with a freight train, causing it to be dragged along the train tracks for more than a kilometre

'One car has made it across, but the vehicle driven by the 23-year-old has become stuck on the tracks,' Superintendent Jorgensen told ABC.

'The men attempted to free the vehicle but were unable to do so.'

Despite both men trying to get the attention of the train driver by shining torches and waving, the kilometre-long freight, which was carrying manganese to Darwin, could not slow down in time and hit the four-wheel drive.

The vehicle was pulled under the locomotive before hanging over the Katherine rail bridge.

Thankfully both men were able to jump from the vehicle, leaving them uninjured. 

Superintendent Jorgensen said the train driver suffered from shock and was taken to Katherine Hospital. He was released at 6am.

'It's happened before, people trying to cross at non-designated crossings, which people should never do,' Superintendent Jorgensen said. 

Superintendent Jorgensen has confirmed no alcohol was involved. 

Both men are reportedly from Katherine, Northern Territory, and are expected to be charged over the dangerous incident

Greg Pauline, the train operator Genesee and Wyoming general manager said the accident has upset him greatly. 

'These young idiots could have killed themselves or my crew,' he said. 

The incident caused a delay for the train, which was carrying groceries to Darwin, behind the freight train.  

'It shouldn't affect our network too much,' he said.

According to Mr Pauline, the four-wheel drive was uninsured. 

Both men are reportedly from Katherine, Northern Territory, and are expected to be charged over the dangerous incident.
