Tottenham have announced that both Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey have left their respective coaching positions at White Hart Lane.

In what was a widely-anticipated move, Ferdinand and Ramsey depart as new head coach Mauricio Pochettino looks to build his own backroom staff.

Ferdinand was brought into the club by Harry Redknapp and, alongside Ramsey, was selected by Tim Sherwood to help him in his first-team duties before the former Spurs player was sacked the end of the season.

The duo were also wanted by Sherwood at West Brom, with the Baggies' offers to the coaches apparently a sticking point which saw the former Blackburn midfielder eventually turn down the chance to return to Barclays Premier League management.

'The club can announce that Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey have left the Club," a statement on Tottenham's official website read.

'Les returned to the Club in a coaching capacity in 2008, initially working with the strikers before linking up with Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey coordinating the Development Squad and most recently working with the First Team.

As a player, Les scored 39 goals in 146 appearances in our colours between 1997 and 2003.

'Chris joined the Club in 2004, working within our Academy set-up, before running our Under-21 side and Development Squad in conjunction with Tim and Les, stepping up to a First Team coaching role in December.

'We should like to thank them for their contribution and wish them well for the future.'

Pochettino was appointed on May 28 after an impressive stint at Southampton and has already taken assistant manager Jesus Perez, first team coach Miguel D'Agostino and goalkeeping coach Toni Jimenez to north London with him.
