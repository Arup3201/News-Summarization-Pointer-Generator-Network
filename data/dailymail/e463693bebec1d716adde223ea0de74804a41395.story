Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher were just two of the stars at the 'One Night in Istanbul' movie premiere on Wednesday night.

The duo were integral for Liverpool in Turkey when they dramatically beat AC Milan in the Champions League final.

'It goes to show how big the night was,  there's still a buzz about it today,' he said. 

'Every day I have conversations about it, in and around the city I still get asked about it and get thanked for my individual performance

'It will be in my memories until the day i go, that's because I love Liverpool just as much as the fans.

'The feeling when Jerzy [Dudek] saved the last pen, I still get goosebumps now. It was a surreal feeling.'
