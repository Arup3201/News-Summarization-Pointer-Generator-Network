Tragic: Soldier David Collins stabbed to death at an Ayia Napa night club

A soldier was murdered in a brawl with British tourists in Cyprus yesterday – less than 24 hours before leaving for Afghanistan.

David
 Lee Collins was stabbed in the early hours after becoming embroiled in a
 row. Three men – all British passport holders with Pakistani and Somali
 backgrounds – will appear in court this morning in relation to the 
incident.

Last night there was growing concern the 19-year-old may have been targeted by anti-Western fanatics.

Mr
 Collins, from Manchester, had left his base at Dhekelia, with three 
other off-duty soldiers from 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers,
 for a final night out after their mission was delayed.

But
 the infantryman was stabbed in the chest following a row with three 
Britons aged 17, 18 and 19 at the popular Black & White Club, in the
 resort of Ayia Napa, an area off-limits to British troops. Mr Collins 
was given first aid but was pronounced dead on arrival at Famagusta 
General Hospital in nearby Paralimni.

The tourists, two of Pakistani and one of Somali origin, were arrested by Cypriot police and were last night in custody.

A fanatical attack on off-duty British soldiers is one motive being considered.

Patrick
 Mercer MP, the former chairman of the House of Commons 
counter-terrorism committee, said: ‘The possibility that off-duty 
British soldiers have been targeted by fanatics is extremely worrying. I
 hope this does not prove to be  the case.’

Last
 night one Cypriot TV station speculated the row which led to the 
stabbing was over race. Cypriot police spokesman George Economou said: 
‘Today at around 3.30am (01.30am GMT), while a group of British soldiers
 from Dhekelia garrison were enjoying themselves at a club in Ayia Napa,
 they had a confrontation with three of their compatriots.

‘During the confrontation one of the three drew what is believed to be a knife, injuring the 19-year-old soldier in the chest.’

A knife was recovered at the scene and it has been sent to a forensic laboratory for tests.

Mr Collins’s family have been informed of his death, the Ministry of Defence said.

Scene: The stabbing took place during a fight between four soldiers and three British tourists at this nightclub

A source close to the battalion
 described the soldiers’ anger that their comrade had been murdered and 
frustration at the delay that led him to be at the nightclub.

The source said: ‘The whole of the base is on lock-down. Feelings are running very high.

‘No
 one is allowed out because it is feared that his comrades would take 
matters into their own hands and track down the culprit. It’s absolutely
 tragic. The battalion was meant to leave for Afghanistan on Saturday 
but the mission was delayed for 24 hours.

‘If they had left on time the lad would be alive today.

‘David was not drunk. He got into an argument with these three guys and when he walked away he got stabbed.

‘You have got to ask yourself, who goes to a nightclub with a knife in their pocket?

‘They
 are not supposed to go to Ayia Napa but it’s got to be wrong that he 
would have been safer in Afghanistan than in a nightclub in Cyprus.’

Ayia Napa Square, where the 
stabbing occurred, is off-limits for British soldiers because of past 
trouble. The ban was imposed by military authorities on all army 
personnel and their relatives stationed on the island following the rape
 and murder of 23-year-old Danish tour guide Louise Jensen in 1994.

Three
 soldiers – Allan Ford, Justin Fowler and Geoffrey Pernell – were 
sentenced to life imprisonment but were freed on appeal in 2006 after 
serving 12 years.

The 
ban was partially lifted in 2009 allowing troops to visit the bar-filled
 square during daylight hours. British Military Police patrol the resort
 at night.

The 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, are currently the ‘theatre reserve battalion’ for Afghanistan.

Based
 at Camp Bastion, the battalion will undergo training to orientate 
troops for potential deployment into the field of combat.

In
 Cyprus the battalion is based in Dhekelia, one of two bases Britain 
retained after the former colony was granted independence in 1960.

There are currently 9,000 British troops and their dependants stationed in Cyprus.
