Citing a police report, WBPF reported the boy told police he got drunk and passed out at the Southwest 6th Street home.

He said that when he woke up, someone told him to go outside and fight. When he refused, Wheeler was allegedly called to kick him out.

The attacker is seen in the video repeatedly punching and kicking the boy, before dragging him by the hair across the room.

The boy told Okeechobee City police that Wheeler then followed him out to the street where he choked him until he passed out.

Police found the boy lying in the middle of the road just after midnight.

He was rushed to hospital with a 
concussion and facial and scalp contusions. His condition is unknown.

WPTV reported
 that an officer at the hospital learned video of the attack was posted 
to Facebook. A detective identified Wheeler as 
the attacker.

Wheeler was arrested on Sunday and charged with child abuse without great bodily harm.

A woman also seen in the video, Evadean Lydecker, has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor.

Lyedecker, reportedly the mother of the boy who threw the party, was at home during the alleged attack.

The victim claimed Lyedecker bought the teens alcohol and drank with them. Lydecker denied giving alcohol to minors and witnessing the fight.

Police
 said that Wheeler admitted losing his temper, but told cops he was 
called to the house because the victim was pushing and punching another 
person.

Wheeler, who has previously been convicted of car burglary, multiple thefts, and resisting arrest, claims the victim tried to hit him.

The disturbing video has caused outrage online, with a Facebook group and a hashtag, #JusticeForAaron (reportedly the name of the victim) springing up quickly.

The people behind the accounts claimed the victim had had been invited to the party under false pretenses so that he could be beaten.

They also accused police of a 'cover-up' for failing to arrest Wheeler soon after the alleged attack - a claim police deny.
