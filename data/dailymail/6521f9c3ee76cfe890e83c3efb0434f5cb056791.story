The northern New Jersey go-go bar that served as the backdrop for strip club scenes in The Sopranos was robbed of $30,000 on Sunday, police said.

Two men with shotguns entered Satin Dolls, a nightclub located along New Jersey Route 17 in Lodi, taking $30,000 early Sunday morning.

Lodi police said in a notice posted to Facebook that the gunmen fled the scene.

The club earned notoriety for being used as the Bada Bing - or sometimes simply The Bing - on the HBO series, with some of its dancers even playing the part of strippers in the show.

Mob boss Tony Soprano, played by the late James Gandolfini, owned the strip club and conducted business from the side of the stage or in the back office.

When Gandolfini died in 2013, CBS reported that the phones at Satin Dolls were ringing constantly with calls. 

'He actually made this bar, you know, people know it by "The Bada Bing,"' said Satin Dolls manager Lance Lyons of Gandolfini.

The mob ties at Satin Girls run deeper than The Sopranos.

Anthony Cardinalle, 62, whose family owns the  property for Satin Dolls, was alleged to be an associate of the Genovese crime family during a federal mob crackdown.

The New York Daily News reports that Cardinalle took a plea deal last December and agreed to cooperate with the feds in a criminal case against organized crime involvement in waste hauling.

Another defendant in the case, Howard Ross, was described by William Pepe of Satin Dolls in a document filed in court as 'holding court at the bar' of the club playing up mob ties.

'Ross was always bragging about his mafia connections and how he knew everybody in the five families,' he stated in court filings.

Pepe made those statements at a time when Cardinalle was asking for a psychiatric evaluation to be performed on Ross, who had dished to an agent posing as a waste hauling company owner.
