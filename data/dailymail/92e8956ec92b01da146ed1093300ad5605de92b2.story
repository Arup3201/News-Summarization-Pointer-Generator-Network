Ronny Deila insisted on Wednesday that Aleksandar Tonev did not make the racist comments attributed to him by Aberdeen’s Shay Logan - and said the Celtic winger was not ‘wasting any energy’ over the matter.

But the Parkhead manager’s unequivocal backing for his player seems certain to anger the Dons as the SFA are still carrying out their investigation into the controversy.

Defender Logan alleged that Bulgarian Tonev called him a ‘black c***’ during Celtic’s 2-1 Premiership win at Parkhead last Saturday. Referee Bobby Madden included the claims in his match report and Logan, Pittodrie boss Derek McInnes and Tonev himself are being interviewed by the governing body.

Tonev is accused of calling Aberdeen's Logan a 'black c***' during the Premiership match at Parkhead 

It’s understood that Sky’s cameras failed to pick up any evidence of abuse and Tonev, on a one-year loan from Aston Villa, vehemently denies the claims. As the player flew to Salzburg in Austria with Celtic for Thursday night's Europa League clash, his version of events were emphatically backed by Deila.

‘That has been no trouble for him,’ said the Norwegian. ‘We made a statement and I trust my players. I know he didn’t do it.

‘He is an honest player and I believe in what he is saying. He has not wasted any energy on that at all. He seems very comfortable. We are in a good mood with the whole squad and it is nothing we have used energy on.’

Logan has declined making a complaint to police, but Parkhead striker Leigh Griffiths is currently the subject of a report to the Procurator Fiscal after he was filmed joining in allegedly racist chants before a Hearts-Hibs clash earlier this year.

Asked if he had felt compelled to remind players of their responsibilities under the club’s code of conduct, Deila added: ‘We haven’t talked about it because it hasn’t been an issue. Everybody knows we don’t want to be associated with those words. I trust my players and he hasn’t said it.

'Aleksandar needs games. He hasn’t played for a long, long time and that’s the problem with a lot of the players we have. They have been in and out for a while. But he is mentally good.’

Deila is missing Charlie Mulgrew, Adam Matthews and Mikael Lustig for tonight’s clash with under-pressure Salzburg, but is able to call on Ghanaian loan signing Wakaso Mubarak for the first time.

‘He was training this week and looks good,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘He is a quick player, a hard working player so we’re looking forward to seeing him in the match.

‘Could he make an impact for us? Sure, he could do that. Again, he hasn’t played many matches in a while but we have a lot of games coming up so we need everyone in the squad.’

Deila believes points away from home will be the key to success in Group D.

Salzburg have lost three games on the trot, but assistant coach Zsolt Low travelled to Glasgow to watch Celtic in action on Saturday.

And coach Adi Hutter said: ‘We have carefully analysed the video of Celtic’s 2-1 win over Aberdeen.

‘They have an experienced squad of international calibre. They are very strong.

‘Kris Commons and Scott Brown are their key players in midfield. However, I also admire Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer.

‘Getting an early goal will be vital. That could solve a lot of problems.

‘It is important that we attack Celtic from the very first minute.

‘We have to press offensively against Celtic. They are very sturdy and strong in the tackle. But I’m not sure if they are accustomed to teams pressing them in the Scottish League.’
