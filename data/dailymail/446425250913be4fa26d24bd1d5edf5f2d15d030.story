Denials: Physiotherapist Leith Brown, pictured, says Patient A's husband wants to 'ruin' him

A hospital physiotherapist had an affair with a married female patient – and the couple spent nights together while the woman’s husband was sleeping in the same house, a disciplinary hearing has heard.

Leith Brown could be struck off the professional register if allegations of misconduct are proved.

The affair ended when the husband found out about it and confronted senior managers at the private Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in North London, which has previously treated Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jerry Hall and Kate Moss.

The woman, known as Patient A, told the hearing that Mr Brown had seduced her when she went to see him for treatment. She said he had been ‘charming and professional’ – until he touched her inappropriately during one session.

A similar incident occurred at another consultation, but she told the tribunal she had not complained because her ten-year-old niece was in the room at the time.

The affair began in 2012, soon after she attended a course he ran in ‘Mindfulness’.

The couple would meet at an annex of her home. Over a period of six months, Brown would stay most nights while the husband was in the main part of the house.

Brown also benefited from thousands of pounds that Patient A spent on restaurant trips and taxis, while in exchange she had not paid for some treatment sessions.

‘We were having an affair, we were not having a relationship,’ she told the tribunal. ‘We couldn’t have a relationship. I’m a married woman.

‘He might have wanted a relationship but he was having sex with other women anyway.

‘He wanted us to live together but it wasn’t going to happen. He was delusional.’

Their trysts ended just over a year later when the woman’s daughter discovered emails between her mother and Mr Brown, and told her businessman father.

Patient A told the panel that the 59-year-old physiotherapist had been ‘very seductive and persuasive. He bombarded me with texts.

‘I was pursued and seduced. I was under his spell. I deceived my husband. I feel awful about it... It’s what he [Mr Brown] wanted.’

But Mr Brown’s barrister, Sue Sleeman, said the sexual relationship started only after her treatment had ended. Asked why she hadn’t complained earlier about his behaviour, Patient A said: ‘I didn’t tell my husband because I wanted to protect Mr Brown.’

The physiotherapist, who is from New Zealand, told the conduct committee of the Health and Care Professions Council that he often met the woman at her home: 

‘She would cook meals for me, we would watch TV together. We enjoyed the sort of relationship you enjoy with anyone you were in love with. I was not particularly interested in some sort of brief sexual affair. I fell in love.’

He said the allegations of inappropriate touching were ‘monstrous’ and that Patient A and her husband, who wanted to ‘ruin’ him, had invented them

Natasha Price, who organises physiotherapy services at the hospital in St John’s Wood, told the tribunal: ‘This relationship was not forced upon this lady. It was a consensual relationship. He should not have been treating her at the time he was in a relationship with her.’

Mr Brown, who no longer practises at the hospital, denies all the allegations against him. The panel will announce its decision in December.
