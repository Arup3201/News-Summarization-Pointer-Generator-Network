An MP is furious after a pole dancing club owned by international porn baron Larry Flynt offered Pippa Middleton £100,000 - to become a stripper.

The club, which is owned by the proprietor of Hustler magazine, is trying to tempt Prince William’s sister-in-law with the six-figure sum to become a 'Hustler Honey'.

In a letter posted this week to the website of Hustler Club UK, based in Croydon, south London,  the clubs states she could be 'exempt' from on-stage performances and could instead 'entertain' her guests in its VIP rooms.

A South London pole dancing club is offering 'exceptional beauty' Pippa Middleton, pictured at this month's British Heart Foundation's Roll Out The Red Ball, £100,000 to become a stripper

It reads: 'We at Larry Flynt’s world famous Hustler Club cordially invite you to become an honorary member of the Hustler Honeys.

'If this should become a reality, I hope very much that you would accept our offer of £100,000 in addition to the gratuities afforded to our top-tier entertainers.'

The club believes her qualities such as 'strength', 'bravery' and 'exceptional beauty' make her the perfect candidate for the role.

The letter, penned by club executive Lily Carousel, believes the role is an 'opportunity to have a little fun' and 31-year-old Pippa would be the 'most exceptional Hustler Honey to date'.

Hustler Club UK, based in Croydon, south London, states she could be 'exempt' from on-stage performances and could instead 'entertain' her guests in its VIP rooms

It continues: 'Exempt from stage performances you could focus solely on entertaining your guests in our luxurious private VIP rooms.

'Your experience in the event planning industry is an asset that would ensure your comfort in entertaining in your new environment whilst our ever-exciting parties would surely benefit from the flair of a professional party planner.

'Nothing would give us greater pleasure than if you were to accept.'

The staunch royalist and Conservative MP for Romford, Andrew Rosindell, blasted the club’s invitation to the sister of Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge.

The letter goes on: 'Your experience in the event planning industry is an asset that would ensure your comfort in entertaining in your new environment'

He said: 'It’s a free country and she can choose to do what she wants to do but I’m sure she wouldn’t accept such an invitation. That would not look good for the royal family.

'Anyone close to the royal family should be above that kind of thing.

'I think it’s pretty gutter stuff really. It’s disrespectful and is the sort of thing that would turn most people off his clubs.'

The letter comes with a caveat in case Pippa doesn’t fancy joining multimillionaire 72-year-old Flynt’s club.

The club believes her qualities such as 'strength', 'bravery' and 'exceptional beauty' make her the perfect candidate for the role

It proposes that if someone proposes to her, she should hold her hen do there.

It reads: 'We would include bottle service and entertainment in our private VIP rooms, including time with some of our amazing Hustler Honeys and their tantalizing performances on three stages.

'We’ll guarantee you the most fun you’ve ever had.'

MailOnline has contacted Pippa Middleton and Hustler Club UK for comment.

Pippa was spotted showing off her Mustique tan last week at the British Heart Foundation's Roll Out The Red Ball fundraiser hand-in-hand with Nico Jackson on Tuesday evening.

Also in attendance was her brother James Middleton and his partner Donna Air, with whom Pippa seemed extremely close to at the event, held at The Park Lane Hotel in Piccadilly, London.

The 31-year-old, who is an ambassador for the charity, wore a striking scarlet lace dress by CH Carolina Herrera to attend the important event with a matching slick of ruby lipstick and heels.

Carrying a box clutch and accessorising with a wide diamond bracelet, the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge wore her brunette locks in delicate curls which framed her pretty features.

Pippa arrived on the arm of her handsome boyfriend Nico Jackson, with whom she hadn't been pictured since last year. The pair have been pursuing a long-distance relationship after he moved to Switzerland for work.
