Online TV giant Netflix is rumoured to be in talks with cable companies in a bid to launch a TV service.

Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, has allegedly met with some of the biggest cable companies in recent weeks to discuss plans which could present a rival to HBO.

Three people who claim to be close to the talks said the service would come through set-top boxes, with a fourth adding that it could be an extra option added to a viewer's bill.

Leading online TV company Netflix is rumoured to be in talks with cable companies about a deal which could see it become a paid on-demand service to rival HBO

The move would represent a major about-face in relations between the company and TV providers, who initially saw the internet giant as a big threat to their $100billion-a-year (£62.5bn) industry.

Hastings has strongly hinted at investor conferences in recent weeks about the possibility of Netflix one day being a cable channel rival to premium networks such as Time Warner's HBO.

He said: 'It's not in the short term, but it's in the natural direction for us in the long term. Many (cable service providers) would like to have a competitor to HBO, and they would bid us off of HBO.'

While many played off the remarks as general speculation about the future, others have suggested that at least one cable provider could experiment with the service by the end of the year.

Talks are though to involve Comcast Corp and Suddenlink Communications, though Netflix will not comment on the rumours.

The move would give Netflix more room to expand its subscriptions as internet capabilities stuggle to keep up with demand.

The service already accounts for a third of all peak US internet traffic, using almost twice as much bandwidth as YouTube.

The market potential is clear too, as in a recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers 70 per cent of those polled said they still subscribed to cable, while 41 per cent said they used Netflix.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers poll in June showed that, while 41 per cent of people use Netflix, a whopping 70 per cent still subscribe to cable TV

However, the world's most popular streaming service still has some way to go in order to compete in the TV market.

Despite producing the award winning show House of Cards, its original content falls way behind the likes of HBO, who are behind dozens of hit series including Game of Thrones, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes famously dismissed the idea that Netflix was a serious threat by equating the service to the 'Albanian Army.'

It must also face down stiff competition online from the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon who are thought to have major plans in the works.

Even if a deal is reached in the near-term, actually receiving Netflix through a cable provider could still take months to launch.

Hastings would first need to rework his licensing deals with programmers since most existing contracts will not allow Netflix to deliver their shows on a cable box, according to a senior programming executive.

Netflix is currently the world's leading internet television network with more than 37 million members in 40 countries watching more than one billion hours of TV programmes and films every month.

On the back of the news Netflix shares gained almost 8 per cent in trading yesterday closing at just under $325 (£203) per share.
