Liverpool could be facing a Champions League nightmare draw on Thursday, with a group containing Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Roma a possibility.

The Reds are only in pot three after a five-year absence from the competition, and so will be pitted against the continent's heavyweights.

The best case scenario for Liverpool would be a group containing Porto, Basel and APOEL or BATE Borisov.

Pot 1: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Benfica, Atletico Madrid, Arsenal, Porto

Pot 2: Schalke, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Shakhtar Donetsk, Basel, Zenit St Petersburg, Manchester City

Pot 3: Bayer Leverkusen, Olympiakos, CSKA Moscow, Ajax, Liverpool, Sporting Lisbon, Galatasaray, Athletic Bilbao

Pot 4: Anderlecht, Roma, Apoel, Bate Borisov, Maribor, Monaco, Malmo, Ludogorets

New signing: Mario Balotelli will hope to inspire Liverpool to Champions League glory this season 

Champions: The galacticos of Real Madrid are the Champions League holders and could face Liverpool

Old boy: Liverpool could be drawn in a group with Barcelona, which would mean a reunion with Luis Suarez

Glory days: Liverpool last won the Champions League in 2005, and are desperate to win the trophy again

Dare to Zlatan: Paris Saint-Germain, led by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, are the strongest side in pot two

Should Liverpool avoid Real Madrid, they would still be paired in a group with one of the top seeds, including Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid. 

A group with Barcelona would mean a possible return to Anfield for controversial striker Luis Suarez. 

Liverpool failed to make it out of the group when they were last in the competition, in 2009-10, and will be hoping for as kind a draw as possible to help them progress. 

Wilcards: Roma, captained by Francesco Totti, are in pot four and look to be a team to avoid 

Outclassed: Liverpool were  beaten 3-1 by Manchester City on Monday and will need to improve
