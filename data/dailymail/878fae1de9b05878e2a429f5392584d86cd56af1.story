The first picture has emerged of the bride-to-be who turned up to her wedding venue only to find it swarming with police after the groom had made a hoax call pretending explosives were hidden there.

Amy Williams arrived at St George's Hall, in Liverpool, wearing her white dress on her wedding day, but found bomb disposal units and police officers searching the venue from top to bottom.

Neil McArdle sparked the bomb scare because he did not want to tell Miss Williams he had failed to finalise their wedding plans.

He was jailed for a year yesterday at Liverpool Crown Court, which was told the couple are still together but, six months on from the incident, have 
still not tied the knot and have no plans to do so.

Miss Williams, who is still living at the couple's address in Kirkby, Merseyside, today refused to comment.

A neighbour said: 'They had both been very quiet over the last few days and I hadn't seen them since before the weekend.

'What he did was very stupid and it's a shame because she's a lovely young girl.

'Amy's devastated at everything that's happened and I think she just wants some time to herself to try and take it all in.'

The couple had pencilled in a date at the iconic building but the groom realised he had not filled in the 'right to marry' forms to legalise the marriage.

Miss Williams is believed to have no plans to marry McArdle, although she is still living at the couple's address in Kirkby, Merseyside,

Threats: McArdle called the Grade II-listed St George's Hall in Liverpool and told staff that there were explosives hidden inside the famous building

The 36-year-old admitted making a hoax call in a panic, from a phone box near his home.

He told a receptionist: 'There’s a bomb in St George’s Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes.'

Following the call the building was placed on lock down while bomb disposal units and police officers searched the venue from top to bottom.

However, when the building was re-opened later in the day, the venue confirmed that no booking for the wedding had been made.

McArdle had planned to marry Miss
Williams at Liverpool Register Office, which is situated within the 
listed St George’s Hall, on April 24.

He pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information with intent at an earlier hearing at Liverpool Crown Court.

Sentencing
McArdle yesterday, Judge Norman Wright said: 'I just don’t accept that 
the penny dropped on the night before the wedding.

'You
are an intelligent man with a degree. Maybe there was an ambivalence in
your mind about the wedding and suddenly you got yourself into quite a 
predicament.

'It seems that you buried your head in the sand until the day of the wedding.'

The judge said that the hoax call had 
been made just days after two explosions went off at the finish line of 
the Boston Marathon, leaving three dead, and that the tragedy 'must have
been at the very forefront of peoples’ minds'.

Plans: McArdle and his fiancée had pencilled in a date to get married at the hall, but he never filled in the 'right to marry' forms to legalise the marriage

He
added: 'Your call to St George’s Hall must have struck sheer terror in 
the heart of the person that received the call and fear in the minds of 
the people who are charged with the responsibility of the safety of 
people inside the building.

'You knew that the wedding couldn’t take place and you didn’t try to level with your partner.

'Instead, you tried to weasel your way out of the situation.

'It
seems there was a betrayal of trust in your relationship. I hope you 
learn from this experience but you have to understand that bomb hoaxes 
are extremely serious.'
