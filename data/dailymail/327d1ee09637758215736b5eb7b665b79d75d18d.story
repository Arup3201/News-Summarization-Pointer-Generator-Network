A man who had been reported missing turned up at a Burger King drive-through on Friday and shot himself in the head.

Samuel Teran, of Las Vegas, Nevada, who had been reported missing since Wednesday, shot himself after employees at the Burger King called authorities to report they had seen the car that Teran and his stepdaughter, Susana Villalvalzo, had last been seen in when they went missing.

Teran died when his family took him off life support, and at the same time became a suspect in the murder of his stepdaughter.

Murder-suicide?: After Samuel Teran (left) committed suicide in a Burger King drive-through, he became a suspect in the death of his stepdaughter, Susana Villalvalzo (left)

Police discovered blood at Teran's house and a missing suitcase, and now suspect he may have killed his stepdaughter, dismembered her, and put her in the suitcase.

Eyewitnesses also say they saw Teran put a suitcase in the truck of his car earlier in the week. 

Family members are saying that while the two did not get along, they did not believe Teran would ever kill Villalvalzo.

'We know that they never got along but not to a point where it would get physical,' Juan Villasenor, Susana's cousin, told KTNV.

'There was some verbal altercations but that was it.' 

Now, Villavalzo's mother has submitted DNA to see if ti matches the blood in Teran's hosue and may be that of her daughter.
