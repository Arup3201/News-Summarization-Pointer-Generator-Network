Catching the bus home, a group of bemused passengers were shocked when they spotted a four-legged friend hopping aboard.

The black miniature pony was booted off the Canterbury-bound bus after trotting on at Folkestone bus station on Wednesday.

The pet was accompanied by its owner, who is believed to have tied it to a post while he visited the toilet, but the cheeky equine slipped its leash and made a dash ending up on the Stagecoach service.

Shocked passengers brandishing their smartphones snapped pictures of the unusual spectacle as the pony stood next to the driver, seemingly asking for a ticket home.

When its owner returned and spotted his pet pony aboard the bus, the mischievous equine was hoofed off.

Passengers took to Twitter to share their shock, @emzii said: 'Only in Folkestone - a damn pony on the bus.'

Meanwhile local Shane Ferguson, 24, said he joked with other passengers about the pony getting the bus to Canterbury - 18 miles from Folkstone - adding: 'The thing just got on the bus like it was the most natural thing in the world.

'It stood by the driver waiting for him to drive off, but had to get off in the end when its owner came back.

'It was a funny sight - you don't see a pony on a bus everyday.'

A spokesman for Stagecoach confirmed the pony had made its way onto a bus on Wednesday, but said it was soon escorted off.

He said: 'The pony didn't actually travel on our bus. It was on board whilst the bus was stationary at Folkestone Bus Station. We do not allow horses to travel on our buses.'
