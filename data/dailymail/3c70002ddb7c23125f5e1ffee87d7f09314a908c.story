The pressure on under-fire TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson intensified today after it emerged that communications watchdog Ofcom is investigating his motoring show Top Gear to see if a recent episode that sparked a race row breached broadcasting guidelines.

The episode, filmed in Burma and Thailand and shown in March, featured a scene where the motoring show’s stars built a bridge over the River Kwai and as an Asian man walked over it Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there’s a slope on it.'

Slope is seen by many as a derogatory term for people of Asian descent, and the show’s producer had to step in 
and apologise for what he called a 'light-hearted' joke.Scroll down for video

Controversy: Comments made by Jeremy Clarkson, pictured during the series finale of Top Gear with co star Richard Hammond, are being investigated by a media watchdog

The segment on Top Gear, which is fronted by (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, may have counted as a breach of 'content standards' 

The Ofcom investigation will look at whether the clip counted as a breach of 'content standards'.

Somi Guha, an actress who complained to the BBC, said the language used was an example of 'casual racism' and 'gross misconduct'.

Clarkson used his Twitter account to respond to the allegations after they first came to light, and said: 'I'm not a racist. I am currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives quite near Wales.'

But in contrast, Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman  said he regretted the 'light-hearted' wordplay and realised 'that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas'.

Andy Wilman made the statement after Indian-born Ms Guha instructed lawyers to make a formal complaint about the use of the word, which she described as 'casual racism'.

In a statement, Mr Wilman said: 'When we used the word "slope" in the recent Top Gear Burma special it was a light-hearted wordplay joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local Asian man who was crossing it.

'We were not aware at the time, and it has subsequently been brought to our attention, that the word "slope" is considered by some to be offensive and although it might not be widely recognised in the UK, we appreciate that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas, for example in Australia and the USA.

It comes after a troubled few weeks for the show and its most famous presenter who is reportedly getting divorced from his wife after 21 years of marriage.

Clarkson was embroiled in controversy last week when it was claimed he used the n-word while reciting the nursery rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe during filming of BBC2’s Top Gear.

The Daily Mirror saw unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two similar sports cars and claims the word 'n*****' can be heard.

Warning: The presenter, pictured apologising, said he is now on his final warning from the Corporation

Clarkson said he 'mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur' in two takes, and used the word 'teacher' in its place in a third.

He claims the BBC has put him on his final warning for 'appearing' to use the racial slur in unaired Top Gear footage - and he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again.

The 54-year-old admitted 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy.

And despite begging for forgiveness less than two days ago for the clip, Clarkson also claimed the Corporation had forced him to apologise and he did not want to.

Writing in his weekly column in The Sun, the presenter compared the apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian civil war because they were both things he had not done.

'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that,' he wrote.

'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one.

'An apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's shirt... But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and hoping the story would die down as a result?'

The pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer, he claimed.

Ms Goha is also 
suing the BBC for up to £1million. Ms Guha claims that broadcasting 
Clarkson's comment amounts to unlawful discrimination by a public body.

Her
 lawyers, Equal Justice, claim her action could cost the BBC £1million 
in punitive damages under equality laws unless it apologises and takes 
the hit motoring show off the air.

They
 say she is one of a group of people who were offended by the term - and
 so sought legal advice from the firm, who previously worked on racism 
allegations surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother.

A BBC spokeswoman for Top Gear said the Corporation had no comment on Miss Guha's action.

May 1: Clarkson denied allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series.

In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

May 2: Clarkson releases a statement saying it was 'inevitable' the BBC would eventually sack him but ‘begged’ for public forgiveness after the footage was aired.

May 6: Reports emerge that Clarkson and his wife, Frances, are getting divorced.

May 6: Ofcom announce investigation into Top Gear episode featuring 'slope' remark

In April Clarkson was accused of racism for naming his dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba.

The 54-year-old Top Gear host was criticised after tweeting a picture of his black West Highland terrier and revealing he had named it after the striker, a prolific goal scorer from the Ivory Coast.

Clarkson, who often mocks political correctness, asked: ‘Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’

Today, Jeremy Clarkson's ex-wife added to claims the BBC presenter is getting divorced - and insisted his current partner deserves a large chunk of his estimated £30million fortune.

Alex Hall, 
who was married to the Top Gear star for six months, came out in support
 of his current wife, Frances, from whom he is said to be getting 
divorced.

Miss Hall said Frances had supported Clarkson throughout his lucrative TV career and so deserved a generous divorce settlement.

Top Gear has been at the centre of a number of controversies. In
 2008, the show was rapped by the BBC Trust for showing Clarkson and 
fellow presenter James May sipping gin and tonic at the wheel during a 
stunt.

During
 a press conference in Australia in February 2009, Clarkson branded then
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'

In
 2011, Hammond was discussing a Mexican sports car and suggested that 
vehicles reflect the national characteristics of the country they are 
from.

He
 said: 'Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, 
leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a
 hole in the middle on as a coat.'

The
 Mexican ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza did make a formal 
complaint to the BBC and called on the presenters to make a public 
apology for stirring 'bigoted feelings against the Mexican people'.

'Ordinarily I don't respond to newspaper allegations, but on this occasion I feel I must make an exception.

'A couple of years ago I recorded an item for Top Gear, in which I quoted the rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny Moe.

'Now,
 of course, I was well aware that in the best known version of this 
rhyme, there is a racist expression that I was extremely keen to avoid.

'The full rushes show that I did three takes.

'In
 two I mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the 
third, I replaced it all together with the word "teacher".

'Now
 when I viewed this footage, several weeks later, I realised that in one
 of the mumbled versions, if you listen very carefully with the sound 
turned right up, it did appear that I'd actually used the word I was 
trying to obscure.

'I was mortified by this, horrified, it is a word I loathe.

'And I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted.

'In fact, I have here the note I sent at the time to the production office.

'And
 it says, "I didn't use the n-word here but I've just listened through 
my headphones and it sounds like I did. Is there another take that we 
could use?"

'Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word.

'And as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough.

'Thank you.'
