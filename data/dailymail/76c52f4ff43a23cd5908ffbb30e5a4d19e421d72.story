Josh Elliott has revealed that when he was a teenager his father's revelation that he was gay caused him to question his own sexuality.

The Good Morning America anchor told how he was struck with loyalty and confusion when his father came out when Josh was 13-years-old.

'My first feeling when my father told me was loyalty- thinking "I guess I have to be gay too. Maybe I'm gay,"' he said on The View this morning.

Historic: The conversation turned to homosexuality in relation to college football star Michael Sam's announcement that he is gay

'It's a lot to work through as an 8th grade boy.'

Elliott's father died suddenly two years after coming out, but the newscaster said that he was happy to have that short period of openness before his father's death because he could see him for who he really was.

'For two years I got to see him complete and out and proud,' Elliott said on The View.

'Thank you for letting me tell my father I Love you dad, and thank you for everything,' he said at the end of Monday's show.

He was inundated with positive messages on Twitter after the broadcast, including one from The View cohost Jenny McCarthy.

'Thanks, Jenny--especially for the chance to share a bit of the man to whom I owe everything. And: great to see you today,' he wrote.

His sister shared a picture of their father, thanking Josh for 'giving dad a voice so powerful'.

This was not the first time that the 42-year-old journalist has spoken about his father, who adopted him at birth with his wife before they split when he came out.

Elliott also spoke about his father at a GLAAD awards dinner in 2012.

Groundbreaking: Michael Sam came out over the weekend, and he is expected to be a top NFL draft pick meaning that he will be the first openly gay professional football player

The subject came up this morning because of the announcement by college football player Michael Sam that he is gay.

Elliott, who worked for ESPN before transferring to Good Morning America, said that Sam's announcement shook him because his 'two worlds collided'.

'I really didn't sleep last night,' Elliott said after hearing Sam's announcement.

Because Sam is expected to be one of the top NFL draft picks, he will inevitably become the first openly gay professional football player.

Elliott likened Sam to Jackie Robinson, the first professional African American baseball player.
