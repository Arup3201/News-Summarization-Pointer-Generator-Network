Probe: Michael Gove is said to have told Ofsted inspectors to fail any schools that appear to be involved in the 'takeover'

Fifteen schools are now being investigated over an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to teach extremist beliefs to children.

Michael Gove is said to have told Ofsted inspectors to fail any schools that appear to be involved.

Following accusations of complacency from MPs, the Department for Education last night confirmed that 15 schools in Birmingham are being inspected.

The results – to be published next month – are expected to show conservative Islamic views being taught, it is claimed.

The Education Secretary is said to 
have told inspectors to fail schools where ‘religious conservatism is 
getting in  the way of learning and a  balanced curriculum’.

It means headteachers and governors judged inadequate on these grounds can be immediately dismissed.

If
 enough schools are rated inadequate, Mr Gove will call for further snap
 inspections. The allegations surfaced last month in a leaked letter 
referring to a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot to take over schools.

The
 letter’s authenticity is unclear, but it led to a flood of claims from 
parents and staff, including takeover of governing bodies by 
fundamentalist Islamists, harassment of non-Muslim headteachers, female 
staff being bullied and gender segregation in lessons. A DfE official 
told the Sunday Times: ‘Extreme religious conservatism often acts as an 
entry to later problems.

‘A 
child who is brought up, age eight, nine, ten, believing that you should
 segregate the sexes and hand out Islamic textbooks is more likely to be
 radicalised in later life.’

Ofsted inspectors were sent into Park View school last month after documents identified it as being targeted by extremists, but now 15 more schools are being probed

Lindsey Clark, the headteacher of Park View school, said she was not aware of any plot but welcomed the investigation and said she would act against anyone plotting against the school

One of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from Father Christmas last year.

Teacher Vicky Hubble, who organised the event at the secular Ladypool Primary School, was allegedly told to cancel it by the new Muslim headmaster, Huda Aslam.

He is said to have told her there would be no presents and ‘no mention’ of Jesus being the son of God.

According to a fellow teacher, Mr Aslam wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing-alongs to songs such as Jingle Bells, but was forced to reinstate the Christmas assembly by Birmingham Council. However, Santa remained banned.

David Cameron has promised ‘swift action’ to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology.

Birmingham
 city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week. 
But MPs said change should have come sooner. Liam Byrne, Labour MP for 
Birmingham Hodge Hill, which covers several of the schools, said the 
probe was moving at ‘glacial’ speed.

Tristram Hunt, Labour’s  education spokesman, said Mr Gove had shown ‘a shocking degree of complacency’.

Birmingham
 MP Khalid Mahmood said that the council has known of the claims for 
‘eight years at least’ but had failed to act for fear of ‘appearing 
anti-Muslim’.

Fresh claims 
have also emerged in Manchester and at two schools in Bradford, 
Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College and  Carlton Bolling 
College.

An Ofsted spokesman said it had not begun inspections there, but did not rule it out.

At
 the centre of the scandal is Birmingham’s Park View Academy, where it 
is alleged that £70,000 was spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to 
Islamic prayers.

A DfE 
spokesman said: ‘We are investigating all evidence put to us. It is 
absolutely vital these investigations are carried out impartially, 
without pre -udgment.’
