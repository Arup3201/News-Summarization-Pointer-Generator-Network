With its 18-carat rose gold casing and a stunning sparkle that comes courtesy of 395 white diamonds, it's safe to say that the Savelli Champagne Diamond phone isn't your average handset.

The £35,000 phone is part of a collection so luxurious it leaves Apple's slick new iPhone 5 looking thoroughly cheap and not at all cheerful.

Designed by Switzerland's Alessandro Savelli, other phones in the range are crafted from precious metals, jewels and exotic skins.

Other luxury features include an ultra-bombé sapphire crystal screen and high-tech android-powered connectivity.

But not every phone in the range is sparkling with diamonds. Among the 11 models available is the sleek Black Sport which has a simple inky leather cover, albeit one crafted from alligator skin.

And should you have the cash to spare, the phones have gone on sale in the UK at - where else? - luxury department store, Harrods.

'We carefully select the best diamonds 
and set them using the ‘serti neige’ or ‘snow setting’ technique,' reveals the brand on its website.

'Stones of differing diameters sit side-by-side, covering the precious metal to enhance the organic curves of each piece.

'Where baguette diamonds are 
used, Savelli employs a seamless setting technique for an immaculate 
finish.'

Expensive though 
they might be, the Savelli range, which is based in Geneva and made its 
debut at Paris Couture Week last summer, isn't the only mobile phone 
range that will leave you at risk of a serious talking to from your bank
 manager.

Swiss watchmaker 
Tag Heuer has also created a range of luxury phones, including models 
that come encased in exotic skins and decorated with jewels.

The Meridiist range, which is sold at Selfridges, includes the Jewellery Pink Sapphire, which is covered in rose alligator skin and is embellished with 47 precious stones.

Even more luxurious is the Jewellery Full Diamonds model, which along with white alligator casing, is decked with 211 shimmering white diamonds.

Each of the phones in the Meridiist range also comes with a complimentary concierge service, which, according to the brand, can get everything from reservations in the world's most exclusive restaurants to tickets to sold out shows.

Precious stones: Tag Heuer's phones come embellished with white diamonds and pink sapphires

Over recent years, pink sapphires have become an increasingly popular part of the jewellers' repertoire.

But not everyone is sold on the stones. In her book, Buried Treasure: Travels Through The Jewel Box, author Victoria Finley reveals that the gems aren't quite what they seem.

Chemically rubies and sapphires are identical and are both a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide).

But while sapphires get their colour from trace amounts of other elements such as titanium, copper and magnesium, only rubies contain traces of chromium - the only material to impart a pink or red colour.

As a result, writes Finley, while its perfectly possible to get purple, yellow or even green sapphires, there is no such thing as a pink or red one.

For jewellers, this creates a problem, as rubies are graded by their colour. Dark 'pigeon's blood' red is considered the most valuable while pale pink is virtually worthless - so much so that unscrupulous dealers will attempt to heat them in a bid to darken the colour, despite a 50 per cent chance that they'll explode instead.

So what do you get when you buy a pink 'sapphire'? The answer is a low grade ruby - a classification endorsed by trade bodies such as International Colored Gemstone Association which doesn't recognise pink sapphires.

Like brown diamonds, pink sapphires might be pretty, but in reality, they aren't nearly as valuable as you might think.
