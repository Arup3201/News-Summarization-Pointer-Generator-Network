A mysterious clown has been showing up in public places across Staten Island for several days and residents of the New York City borough are reacting on social media with everything from laughter to fear to outright anger.

The clown has thus far been known to hang out near train stations, in front of bank in broad daylight and behind trees at dusk, where he smiles and slowly waves at passersby while holding little balloons.

While the clown hasn't broken any laws, he's caused a ruckus from Staten Islanders who can't help but associate it to the blood-thirsty killer clown of  Stephen King's It.

Creepy: A mysterious clown has been terrifying residents of Staten Island since nearly two weeks ago

'I'm driving home from the gym and this is what I see,' wrote Instagram user Robert Privitera with a particularly creepy shot of the yellow-clad clown. 'Guess who ain't sleeping tonight.'

The haunting trickster first started cropping up on Staten Islanders' newsfeeds in the last week or two.

Last Sunday, comedian Vic Dibitetto posted a video he took of the clown to Facebook.

It shows the clown waving and pointing at drivers in broad daylight as they pass a TD Bank drivethru.

'Funny, how?' Dibitetto wondered.

Scary either way: The clown's appearances, which are thus far unexplained, come at both night and during broad daylight

Boo! One man posted this photo of the clown as it waved from behind a tree in a residential area  

While Dibitetto's experience was creepy, the clown appears to be at his scariest in the dark.

Michael Leavy learned this the hard way.

'Ok so I'm a little freaked out right now. I was driving home from Buffalo Wild Wings and saw this waving at me,' wrote Leavy on Instagram after snapping the clown, which appeared from behind a tree.

Vincent Innocente also saw the clown at night, near a train station waving to cars as he was caught by their high beams.

'He was just kinda standing there waving,' said the confused Innocente.

The
 reason behind the bizarre appearance of the Staten Island clown remains
 unexplained, but if a similar story from across the Atlantic is any 
indication, the man behind the white makeup is little more than a 
prankster.

Last year, 
residents of the English town of Northampton started being spooked by a 
very similar clown, who turned out to be a college student named Alex 
Powell.

The same clown?
