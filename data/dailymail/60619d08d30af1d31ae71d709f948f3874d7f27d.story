A Louisiana man who wears a tinfoil helmet to stop signals entering his head was arrested after threatening to torch four high schools.

Shane Kersey, 35, was tracked to a friend's house in Lafitte by detectives after he left a message making the threat at four Westbank schools.

Sherriff's spokesman Colonel John Fortunato says the phone threats to burn down the schools were received early Wednesday morning. The threats led to lockdowns and the evacuation of one school, reports WWL.

Threat: Louisiana man Shane Kersey, wearing his tinfoil hat, threatened to burn down four schools. Police tracked his phone and arrested him

'Upon reviewing the numerous recordings left on Fisher High and Marrero Academy's phone answering systems, our investigators were able to determine a phone number from where the calls originated,' Fortunato said.

'Shortly thereafter, our investigators called the phone number and in turn were greeted by a subject who identified himself as Shane Kersey.

'When questioned relative to the threatening phone calls at the schools, Kersey admitted making the phone calls to four schools this morning, two in Jefferson Parish and two in Plaquemines Parish.'

He told officers he was at friend's home in Gretna, where he was then arrested.

Fortunato says Kersey told investigators: 'The foil wrapped around his head secured by a baseball cap was there to prevent microwave signals from entering his head.'

Authorities say a search found no threatening devices at the schools.

According to police, Kersey has an extensive criminal record with multiple arrests for possession of narcotics, simple burglary, aggravated battery, criminal trespassing, theft, illegal possession of a weapon and numerous traffic offences.

Kersey was charged with two counts of terrorising, along with being a fugitive from Plaquemines Parish on a burglary warrant.

A notice on Marrero Academy's website read: 'A threatening call was recorded by our answering machine at 5:56 A.M. The proper authorities were notified, including the fire department and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office.

'As per our crisis plan, all carpool and bus students were diverted from campus. Out of an abundance of caution the school was locked down, giving the authorities time to complete an assessment.

'After we received clearance, the bus students returned and normal school operations resumed. All precautions were taken because the safety of our Marrero Academy students is of utmost importance.'
