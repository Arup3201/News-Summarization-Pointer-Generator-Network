The Iranian lawyer for two American men sentenced to eight years in an Iranian prison said Sunday that he will appeal the verdict.

Masoud Shafiei, who represented Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, said his clients did nothing wrong and he would appeal the verdict and sentences.

He said: 'I will use entire legal capacity to defend them.'

Under Iranian law, a conviction of espionage can carry up to a 10-year prison sentence.

However, a sentence for illegal entry can run from six months to three years in jail.

The terms are often significantly reduced upon appeal.

Bauer and Fattal, both 28, were sentenced to 
three years each for illegal entry into Iran and five years each for 
spying for the United States.

Shafiei said the men were notified about the ruling by Iranian authorities.

Iranian state TV first reported the verdict Saturday.

On Sunday, Tehran's chief prosecutor Jafari Dowlatabadi confirmed the sentences and said the Americans have 20 days to appeal.

Relatives of Bauer and Fattal said the sentences have hit them hard, but they remain hopeful the men will eventually be released.

The two men were arrested in July 2009 on the Iran-Iraq border.

A third American who was taken with them, Sarah Shourd, was released in September 2010 on $500,000 bail and returned to the United States.

Mr Dowlatabadi said Shourd's case 'is still open and she will be tried in absentia.'

The Americans say they mistakenly crossed into Iran when they stepped off a dirt road while hiking near a waterfall.

While other parts of Iraq remain troubled by violence, the semiautonomous Kurdish north has drawn tourists in recent years, including foreigners.

The case has added to tensions already high between the U.S. and Iran over other issues, including Tehran's disputed nuclear program.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the U.S. is 'deeply disappointed' by the sentences and the men have the nation's and President Obama's 'unflagging support.'

'We continue to call and work for their immediate release - it is time for them to return home and be reunited with their families,' she said.

Samantha Topping, spokeswoman for Bauer and Fattal's families, sent a statement Sunday, saying relatives had been notified of their sentences.

'Of the 751 days of Shane and Josh's imprisonment, yesterday and today have been the most difficult for our families,' it said.

'Shane and Josh are innocent and have never posed any threat to the Islamic Republic of Iran, its government or its people.'

But the statement also said the families still hoped the two would be released, based on remarks from Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi.

He said earlier this month that he hoped the trial 'will finally lead to their freedom.'

The families had been hoping that meant the men would be freed in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when pardons are usually handed down.

Their Sunday statement appealed 'to the authorities in Iran to show compassion and allow them to return home to our families without delay.

'We also ask everyone around the world who trusts in the benevolence of the Iranian people and their leaders to join us in praying that Shane and Josh will now be released.'

The gap between words by Salehi and the verdict indicates increasing rift between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration and hardline judiciary, controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters.

Ahmad Bakhshayesh, a professor of 
politics in Tehran Azad University, said the sentences are a 
message to the U.S. that 'Iran is trying to relay a tit-for-tat message 
to Washington that we sentence Americans as you did it against Iranian 
nationals in the U.S.'

Over the past months, Iran has 
brought up the cases of several Iranians being held in U.S. custody, 
particularly Shahrazad Mir Gholikhan.

The mother of twin girls was 
sentenced in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 2009 to serve more than five 
years in federal prison for her role in a scheme to smuggle 3,500 pairs 
of military night-vision goggles to Iran in violation of the U.S. 
embargo.

Iran also has demanded an investigation into the alleged mistreatment of its own citizens in U.S. custody.

The two countries have no direct 
diplomatic relations, so Washington has been relying on an interests 
section at the Swiss Embassy in Tehran to follow the case.
