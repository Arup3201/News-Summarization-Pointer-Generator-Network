The deaths of two law students in  an apparent murder-suicide has stunned their  classmates, who never expected the couple's tragic end.

Wajih Mazloum, 28, and his girlfriend Sara LaMont, 25, were found dead in their apartment near Tulane University in New Orleans, where both were in their second year of law school.

Investigators believe that Mr Mazloum shot Ms LaMont before turning the gun on himself.

Wajih Mazloum, 28, and Sara LaMont, 25, were found dead Sunday morning after an apparent murder-suicide near Tulane University

Their bodies were found Sunday morning by the couple's roommate, along with a handgun near the suspected shooter.

The university released a statement saying it is mourning the loss of the boyfriend and girlfriend, who were from Rhode Island and New Jersey respectively and had lived together since last year.

Neighbors said that they did not notice or hear the couple fighting and that Mr Mazloum never acted aggressively towards Ms LaMont.

They were most well known for sitting on their porch balcony, smoking cigarettes and keeping an eye on the happenings of their block.

Friends and professors of Ms LaMont said that the young woman, who was planning on going into sports law, was 'enormously talented' and one of the sharpest at the school.

Students at Tulane Law School made a memorial for the couple, who were described as smart with bright futures

The student previously worked with the New Jersey Nets and the New York Yankee affiliate Trenton Thunder before entering law school.

She served on the Tulane Law Review, which required outstanding academic achievement, according to the New Orleans Advocate, and the school's Student Bar Association described her as 'brilliant'. 

Law school dean David Meyer said that both students had bright futures ahead of them, making the incident 'inexplicable'.

Mr Mazloum, who worked with disadvantaged youth, was also described as 'positive and upbeat'.

The couple had lived together in their New Orleans apartment (above) since last year and neighbors had never heard them fight or act aggressively

He had previously worked in finance and was a student attorney at Tulane's environmental law clinic. 

The student was known to have a love of gummy bears.

However one friend said he wondered when he heard about the student's purchase of a firearm at a recent gun show but was not too worried, according to The Times-Picayune. 

There will be no record of Mr Mazloum's buying the weapon if he did in fact by it at a gun show, according to firearms authorities. 

Students placed flowers at a memorial outside the law school on Monday to remember their classmates. 

The Tulane community has suffered from seven untimely deaths so far this academic year, four of which were suicides.

University president Michael Fitts said it had been an 'extraordinarily difficult year'.
