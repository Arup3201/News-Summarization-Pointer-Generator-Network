BT is to launch its own mobile phone service along with free access to Premier League football on the go starting at £5 a month.

The move has been welcomed by consumer groups as the telecoms giant attempts to spread its empire from home telephone, internet and pay TV into mobile phones.

This so-called ‘quad play’ service is seen as key by the likes of BT and its rivals Sky, Virgin and TalkTalk to future growth and profits.

BT hopes that it will be able to sign up millions of households to packages that include the four services to cement its place as Britain’s dominant media company in the 21st century.

The company’s move comes ahead of its purchase of the UK’s largest mobile phone network EE in a deal worth £12.5billion.

It has unveiled three SIM card deals, where customers buy a SIM and simply fit it to their existing handset in order to get access to calls, texts and 4G internet services, including video streaming.

The service will operate across the EE masts as well as the wi-fi network offered via more than five million BT Wi-fi hotspots.

The 12-month contracts will appeal to people who want to keep their existing handset but add a relatively cheap bundle of 4G data, minutes and texts. Alternatively, they can buy a new 4G phone from the BT Shop from as little as £99.

The cheapest SIM card deal offers 500 MB of 4G data, unlimited texts and 200 minutes of calls for £5 a month if you are an existing BT Broadband customer and £10 a month for everyone else.

The monthly charge for 2GB of data on 4G, unlimited texts and 500 minutes of calls is £12 for BT customers and £17 for others.

At the top end, customers can take an enormous 4G data allowance of 20GB, with unlimited texts and minutes, for either £20 a month for BT customers or £25 for other customers.

The cheapest deal will be for existing customers, at just £5 per month for 500 MB of 4G data, unlimited texts and 200 minutes of calls

BT is sweetening the offer by giving away free BT Sport on the BT Sport App, which offers live Barclays Premier League football matches. There is also a spending cap on all tariffs.

Executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, suggested the BT move will boost competition and so could be good news for consumers.

‘BT entering the quad play market could lead to stronger competition but consumers need to be able to easily compare prices of the services offered. Any impact on competition in the mobile market will depend on the terms of BT’s agreement with EE,’ he said.

‘BT should use its entry into this market to drive improvements in customer service and to innovate for its customers. Any positive changes must not be set back by the merger of BT and EE.’

Mobile expert at the website broadbandchoices, Dominic Baliszewski, said: ‘BT’s 4G SIM-only launch is exactly the kind of shake up that was needed.

‘Starting at just £5 per month, the pricing is very competitive for existing BT customers and confirms BT’s ambitious plans to dominate quad-play before anyone else can get a foothold.

‘TalkTalk and Virgin Media have both had their own mobile offering for a while now, yet people have so far remained hesitant to sign up on a quad-play basis.

‘Broadband, TV and phone is still very much seen as a household purchase whereas a mobile phone service is considered a personal one. Bringing about a shift in perception will not happen overnight but if BT are willing to put the marketing muscle so badly needed behind these packages, quad-play could completely change the bundles market.’

John Petter, chief executive of BT Consumer, said: ‘Offering BT customers the UK’s best value 4G data deal is a great way to start our journey towards re-establishing ourselves as a major player in consumer mobile.

‘We are offering 4G on the UK’s biggest network along with unlimited access to the most extensive wi-fi coverage via our 5m BT Wi-fi hotspot network.

‘Our customers are consuming increasing amounts of data and they want the best possible connection wherever they are. It’s our ambition to meet this demand by combining the power of our fixed fibre service with wi-fi and the convenience of mobile.’

TalkTalk hit back by claiming it already offers cheap mobile tariffs starting from £3.75 a month.

Spokesman, Tristia Harrison, said: ‘Our mission is to make Britain better off, that’s why TalkTalk homes make significant savings compared to other providers, while also getting more for their money. We offer better value tariffs with a great range of handsets. The rapid growth of our mobile base is proof that more and more homes are reaping the benefits of Britain's best value quad-play services.’
