Convicted IRA member John Downey, 62, walked free from court after it emerged he was one of 187 terror suspects who have a letter giving immunity from prosecution

The secret deal that let suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downey walk free from court means that 187 IRA terror suspects will now be off the hook, too.

Downey was just one of 200 suspected terrorists, known as 'On The Runs' or OTRs, sent a letter guaranteeing that they would not face arrest or have to stand trial if they returned to the UK.

Other high-profile terrorism suspects thought likely to have similar letters include Maze Prison escapees and three IRA members wanted in connection with murders of British soldiers.

Today Prime Minister David Cameron described the actions that led to the collapse of the Downey trial as a 'dreadful mistake', while Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson indicated he was prepared to resign unless there was a judicial inquiry into the trial's collapse.

He said: 'I have to say quite frankly that I am not prepared to be the first minister of a government that is kept in the dark on matters that are relevant to what we are doing.'

Meanwhile Attorney General Dominic Grieve stood by his decision to allow the prosecution to go ahead in the first place and said the allegations faced by Downey were 'of the utmost seriousness'.

The effective amnesty for the fugitives was granted in a secret deal between Tony Blair's Labour government and Sinn Fein as they worked towards a peace deal in Northern Ireland.

The Old Bailey heard how Blair, the then Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson, and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams conducted secret negotiations to deal with the OTRs - an issue said to be a crucial stumbling block to the decommissioning of weapons.

Under the project known as 'the administrative scheme', an estimated 200 suspected IRA fugitives were sent letters by the Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) assuring them they were free from potential prosecution, despite there being outstanding warrants against them.

The court judgement revealed that in 2000 there were an estimated 200 On The Runs, and allowing for those who have died in the 14 years since, it suggests that possibly every IRA member on the run has a letter like Downey's, which he received in 2007.

Sinn Fein politician Gerry Kelly told the Old Bailey in Downey's trial: 'It is impossible to overstate the importance of the assurances given to the 187 recipients, which included John Downey, being maintained.

'These were essential in the achievement of the series of agreements that began with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and were consolidated in... the commencement of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2007', the Belfast News Letter reported.

Downey, a convicted member of the IRA, was on the list of OTRs because of his suspected involvement in the 1982 Hyde Park bombing that killed four Household Cavalry soldiers and four horses and left 31 others injured.

He became a suspect three weeks after the attack on 20 July, when his fingerprints were found on parking tickets in the stolen car used in the bombing, but denied responsibility for the attack.

Lieutenant Anthony Daly, 23, Tropper Simon Tipper, 19, Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, 19, and Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, 36, all of the Blues and Royal, died in the attack as they rode from their barracks at Knightsbridge to Horse Guards Parade when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails went off.

Other IRA fugitives likely to have been sent letters reassuring them they would not be prosecuted include Kevin Barry Artt, PÃ³l Brennan, and Terrence Kirby, three of the 'H-Block four' who escaped from the notorious Maze Prison in Northern Ireland in 1983.

They fled to the US, from where they have resisted extradition attempts.

In September 1983 38 prisoners broke out of the notorious Maze prison in Northern Ireland - some of those who are still on the run may be in possession of a letter giving them amnesty from prosecution

Victim: Captain Robert Nairac of the Grenadier Guards, pictured in beret, was murdered by the IRA in 1977

Sinn Fein general secretary Rita O'Hare, who was arrested in Northern Ireland in 1972 for the attempted murder of British Army officer Frazer Paton, has been on the run since fleeing when she was released on bail and is suggested as one of the highest profile people likely to have been given secret amnesty.

And Patrick Maguire and Terry McCormick, wanted in connection with the murder of British Army officer Robert Nairac in May 1977, are also names believed to be on the list. 

Captain Nairac, 28,was abducted from a pub in Co Armagh and killed by the provisional IRA.  His body has never been found but he was awarded the George Cross posthumously in 1979.

Today a Sinn Fein spokesman refused to talk about the names of those who have letters of immunity and told MailOnline it was a 'personal issue'.

He said: 'It's a personal issue for those involved. I don't want to be listening to any names. I don't want to hear any names.'

Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, left, said the news about the secret amnesty revealed 'the rotten skulduggery behind the peace process', while Attorney General Dominic Grieve, right, who said he stood by his decision to prosecute Downey, was due to answer MPs questions on the collapsed trial this afternoon

It emerged today that Attorney General Dominic Grieve would answer MPs' questions after Downey's trial collapsed because of a blunder described by victims' relatives as 'monumental'.

Tewkesbury Tory MP Laurence Robertson, who chairs the Northern Ireland select committee, has been granted an urgent question on the matter by Speaker John Bercow, to take place after Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon.

In a written statement ahead of the Commons' proceedings, Mr Grieve said: 'Before he was charged my consent was sought, as the law requires, for him to face a charge of causing an explosion. I gave that consent.

'I believed then that it was right to do so and I remain of the same view today.

'The allegations faced by Mr Downey were of the utmost seriousness. The bombing was an attempt by the Provisional IRA to bring their terrorist campaign to London and to attack armed forces personnel who were on ceremonial duties.

'Whatever the circumstances in which the letter had been sent, and it is now clear that its assurances were wrongly given, it is right that the matter should be tested in court.

'Neither I nor the CPS were prepared to accept that the letter and the circumstances in which it had been given were such as to automatically prevent Mr Downey's prosecution.'

Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson said the collapse of Downey's trial yesterday was 'an outrage'

After news of the letters granting immunity emerged yesterday, relatives of the four soldiers killed in the 1982 Hyde Park terror attack said in a statement: 'It is with great sadness and bitter disappointment that we have received the full and detailed judgement and that a trial will now not take place.

'This news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down, even more so when the monumental blunder behind this judgement lies at the feet of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.'

Northern Ireland chief constable Matt Baggott apologised to the families, saying: 'I deeply regret these failings, which should not have happened.'

Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson said yesterday's decision was 'an outrage', adding that it was 'a sad day for victims of terrorism', while TUV leader Jim Allister said it showed 'the rotten skulduggery behind the peace process'.

Downey has declined to comment.
