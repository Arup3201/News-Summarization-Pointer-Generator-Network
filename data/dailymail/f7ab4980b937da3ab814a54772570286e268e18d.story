Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has vowed to stay at the club after seeing his Gunners side end their nine-year wait for silverware by beating Hull City in the FA Cup final

Hull stunned the expectant Gunners supporters, astonishingly taking a two-goal lead within eight minutes, but Wenger's side eventually clicked into gear, with Aaron Ramsey the eventual hero in extra time.

Wenger had insisted the result at Wembley would have no bearing on his decision to stay at the club but confirmed after the victory he would be remaining at the Emirates.

'I always said my future doesn't depend on this but I always wanted to stay,' Wenger told ITV when asked if he was staying before saying, 'Yes, I will.'

He added: 'We wanted to make history tonight and win the game and we did that in both ways - how not to start the Cup final and how to come back,' Wenger said.

'I think it was a turning point in the life span of this team - to know they can win in that way was really important today.

'It would have been terrible [to lose] but we came back. I've praised the spirit of this team and they showed that today. Congratulations to Hull they played fantastically the whole game.'

Match-winner Aaron Ramsey had trouble keeping his emotions in check after the thrilling game and admitted he feared the worst when Hull raced into a two-goal lead.

'I am getting a bit emotional and I am not usually,' the Welsh midfielder said. 

'I get emotional thinking about it. We have conceded early in lots of big games this season, but we showed great strength of character to come back and to score the winner is something I have dreamed off.

'This one is for the manager and the fans who have already believed in us, even when things have not gone well for us.'

Jack Wilshere revealed Hull's quick-fire start to the match caused him to feel sick but was glad the team could win the cup for their long-suffering fans.

'We never do it easy. In the first half, I was sitting on the bench, and I felt sick,' he said.

'Second half we were in control but this 
win is for the Arsenal fans. Kieran Gibbs pulled his calf at the end but that 
shows his character as he stayed on, it's fantastic.'

Losing Hull manager Steve Bruce was proud of his players' efforts but was disappointed with some refereeing decisions which cost the team.

'I couldn't ask more from my players. The vast majority are ones that got us out the Championship,' Bruce said.

'It could have been a memorable season. In terms of effort and determination you couldn't fault them, we didn’t have enough but I'm proud, they were magnificent.

'Their first goal wasn't a free-kick, the second one wasn't a corner. But now is not the time to whine. We had a wonderful opportunity.
