Senior German officials are set to travel to the U.S. 'shortly' for talks about allegations the NSA bugged Angela Merkel's phone.

The heads of Germany's foreign and domestic intelligence agencies will participate in high-level discussions with the White House and National Security Agency, government spokesman Georg Streiter said.

He did not give a specific date for the trip, saying it was being arranged on 'relatively short notice'.

Unhappy: Merkel suggested at an EU gathering that she was not placated by talks with President Obama

News of the talks signals an escalation in the diplomatic tensions between America and her allies after it was claimed the NSA had monitored the calls of 35 world leaders.

Brazil and Germany earlier announced that they have joined forces in an attempt to pile pressure on the United Nations to rein in the snooping activities of American spies.

The two nations want a UN General Resolution that promotes the right to privacy on the
internet in the first major international response to the National Security Agency's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners.

The step comes after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the recent US espionage scandal has shattered international trust in Barack Obama following claims her phone may have been tapped by American agents.

A month earlier Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff branded the NSA's clandestine activities 'a breach
of international law' in a speech to the UN General Assembly and demanded steps be made to stop 'cyberspace from being used as a weapon
of war'.

Brazilian and German diplomats met in
 New York yesterday to thrash out a draft resolution that demands the 
strengthening of privacy rights in the International
Covenant Civil and Political Rights.

While
 the UN has no real power to reign in the NSA, there are fears among 
security experts that the effort alone could signal a growing consensus 
to freeze the US out of future international security dialogues.

'The
 worst case scenario I think would be having our European allies saying 
they will no longer share signals intelligence because of a concern that
 our SigInt is being derived from mechanisms that violate their privacy 
rules,' Ray Kimball, an army strategist with policy experience on 
European issues, told The Cable.

The International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights was written in 1966 and came into force in 1976, long before the internet was invented.

Article 17, says 'no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honor and reputation.'

It also says that 'everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.'

Germany and Brazil want the UN to apply those protections to online activities as well.

Meanwhile,
 Mrs Merkel's stern remarks at the EU gathering indicated she was not 
placated by talks yesterday with President Obama, or his personal 
assurances that the US is not listening in on her calls now.

‘We need trust among allies and 
partners,’ she told reporters in Brussels, Belgium. ‘Such trust now has 
to be built anew. This is what we have to think about.’

'The
 United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are 
allies. But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I 
repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be

'It's
 become clear that for the future, something must change - and 
significantly. We will put all efforts into forging a joint 
understanding by the end of the year for the cooperation of the 
(intelligence) agencies between Germany and the U.S., and France and the
 U.S., to create a framework for the cooperation.'

The
 White House may soon face other irked heads of state and government. 
The Guardian said it saw a confidential memo suggesting the NSA 
monitored 35 world leaders' communications in 2006.
