It is a charity shrouded in as much mystery as that of the organisation it supports.

A charitable trust set up to support Britain's spies and spooks has been registered, but the listing, unsurprisingly, is rather short on details.

The Cinquefoil Trust supports serving and former members of the domestic spy agency MI5 - specifically helping members and their families who have come across 'financial hardship'.

The Cinquefoil Trust's only available contact detail is the post box it shares with its domestic spy agency MI5

The charity's cloak and dagger listing lacks almost all details other registered charities provide, such as financial records and trustee names - for which it has received special dispensation by the Charity Commission to keep secret.

Registered in June, The Cinquefoil Trust - named after the leaf that appears on the MI5 logo - cites a trust deed dated May 30 that is not listed.

Its existence has long been known of, but only lately has it been registered with the Charity Commission.

It does state, however, it is used for the relief of 'financial hardship amongst serving and former members of the security service, the dependants of any such member and those in a family relationship with any such member'.

The Sunday Times reported fundraisers such as book sales, raffles and snooker tournaments were being held to pay for wheelchairs and house alterations for members injured in the line of duty.

While book sales are a far cry from the often glamorous exploits associated with MI5, a source told the Times the trust had made a 'real difference' to many members' lives.

'The trust has been able to make a real difference to people when they most need help and support.

'It is a great example of the close-knit community.'

With no registered address or contact number, The Cinquefoil Trust's can only be reached via the MI5 post box, for which correspondence can be addressed to 'The Secretary'.
