The £100million cocaine yacht stormed by Irish marines was skippered through its weeks-long Atlantic voyage by an old-age pensioner from West Yorkshire, authorities say.

The 70-year-old British suspect was arrested aboard the 60ft Makayabella along with two other men, aged 35 and 28, allegedly with bales of cocaine so big they used them as makeshift furniture.

All three are from West Yorkshire, where police have arrested two other men, aged 45 and 47. A sixth man is being hunted on suspicion of involvement in a smuggling operation.

The yacht has been tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, stopping off in Trinidad, before being stormed by an elite Navy squad 200 nautical miles off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point

The 70-year-old skipper is believed to have been an experienced sailor. The smugglers are believed to have planned to transfer the cocaine onto a smaller boat at sea before ferrying it to shore in North Wales.

Under armed guard today, the one tonne haul was offloaded from the yacht onto the docks at Haulbowline naval base in Cork harbour, where it was towed to last night.

The yacht was tracked by authorities in several countries as it left Venezuela, stopping off in Trinidad, before being intercepted by the Irish navy 200 nautical miles off Mizen Head - Ireland's most southerly point.

During the tense night-time sea raid, two teams set off from the coastal patrol vessel LE Niamh on smaller inflatable boats, armed with pistols and batons.

'It was a particularly dark night,' said Captain David Barry of the Irish Navy. 'We believe they had no idea we were there until we were actually on board.'

Members of the navy stand with the haul of cocaine thought to be worth in the region of £100million. If that value is confirmed it will be one of the biggest drug seizures in Europe this year.

The crew put up no resistance and no arms have been yet found on board. They were said to be in reasonably good condition for being at sea for so long.

They were literally sitting on the bales of cocaine when they were intercepted.

The yacht was in reasonable condition but the sails had been damaged and it had developed engine problems and it had to be towed into Cork harbour by the naval ship LE Roisin.

The three Britons arrested on board the vessel are being questioned at Bridewell Garda Station in Cork under drug trafficking laws. They can be held for seven days.

The UK National Crime Agency, French and Venezuelan authorities as well as the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre based in Lisbon were all involved in the international effort.

Security sources in Britain believe the consignment was destined for the north of England.

Details of the naval operation were kept secret for more than a day-and-a-half.

The National Crime Agency confirmed a 43-year-old man had been arrested in the Leeds area.

He was detained in the early hours of yesterday on suspicion of conspiring to import Class A drugs in an operation assisted by officers from West Yorkshire Police. He was subsequently bailed until January.

Earlier, today a 47-year-old man from Leeds was arrested also arrested and is being questioned at a police station in the West Yorkshire area.

Detectives said they are still seeking another individual from the area.

Hank Cole, Head of International Operations for the National Crime Agency, said the investigation is ongoing.

'Thanks to the co-operation between the NCA and our Irish, French and Venezuelan colleagues, we have managed to prevent this cocaine reaching our streets and causing damage to communities,' he said.

'I pay tribute to all those involved.'

Investigation: Customs officials aboard the Makayabella

The passage around the south-west coast of Ireland has been well used in recent times by drugs smugglers bringing shipments from South America and Africa into Europe.

Authorities describe it as the western frontier of Europe.

In 2007, a record £344 million of cocaine was seized in Dunlough Bay in west Cork when a UK gang botched an attempt to bring the massive haul ashore on a smaller boat and capsized in rough weather.

Most of the group, including two Englishmen, were arrested in follow-up operations and eventually given lengthy prison sentences.

Just a year later, a £312 million haul was intercepted on the Dances With Waves yacht about 150 miles off Mizen Head.

Three British men on board were later jailed for 10 years each for their part in the plot.

The mastermind, John Alan Brooks, was jailed for 28 years for the plot to bring the massive haul to England from Venezuela.
