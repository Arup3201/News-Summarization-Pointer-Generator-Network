They had sprayed champagne, talked excitedly about a shopping list of cars and mansions and made generous promises to help friends in need.

But as Dave and Angie Dawes were flown away by helicopter after being unveiled as ecstatic £101million Lottery winners, a  rather less jolly picture emerged.

Not everyone, it seems, is lining up to wish them well.

Angie’s ex-husband, John Leeman, could barely contain his anger as he claimed she had left him and her son with £20,000 of debts after having a secret affair with Mr Dawes.

Sweet and sour: Dave and Angie Dawes' celebrations were marred by allegations that she had thrown her husband and son out of the family home after a string of affairs

And her teenage son Steven claimed his mother abandoned him when she walked out on the family to start a new life.

Mr Leeman, married to her for 12 
years until the alleged affair was exposed, told the Daily Mail last 
night: ‘She’s talking about making 20 of her friends millionaires – but 
what about her son?’

The bitter allegations surfaced 
within hours of the couple starring at a press conference to tell the 
world that Mr Dawes’s single line of numbers in the EuroMillions lottery
had scooped the massive prize.

They spoke of their plans to buy a 
new engagement ring to replace the £800 model Miss Dawes already has.

They also hope to buy a home in 
Portugal, where they plan to marry next year in a ceremony which Miss 
Dawes said would be a ‘bit more glamorous now’.

Then came gifts for friends. ‘We’ve 
drawn up a list of about 15 to 20 people that we’re going to sort of 
make millionaires,’ said Dave, in much the same tone as someone 
distributing a couple of fivers from of his wallet.

‘Anyone that’s 
helped us through our life.’

The winning line was a selection of randomly chosen numbers and the ticket was bought from WH Smith in Market Place in Wisbech.

He
told the press conference in Hatfield Heath, Hertfordshire: 'We were 
watching TV and the EuroMillions draw show came on so we kept watching, 
not thinking we would win anything.

'We got our tickets out and watched in shock as, one by one, the numbers came up on the line I'd chosen.

'We couldn't believe it! It was too 
late to call Camelot so I kept the ticket on me all night until the 
morning but we didn't sleep a wink.'

But Back home in Wisbech, 
Cambridgeshire, where the couple shared a £70 a week one-bedroom flat, 
the bile was already beginning to surface.

Last night Miss Dawes released a 
statement saying she was saddened by her ex-husband’s claims and that 
she loved her son and would like to rebuild their relationship.

Mr Leeman, a lorry driver, accused 
his 43-year-old ex-wife of ‘abandoning’ their son Steven after 
conducting a secret affair with her lover in the family home.

Big winners: Dave plans to buy Angela a new engagement ring before they tie the knot next year. She changed her surname to Dawes after getting divorced

Shopping spree: Dave and Angela are planning to buy properties in London and abroad, and are looking forward to a trip to Las Vegas and a skiing holiday in Switzerland in the coming months

Big winners: Dave and Angela's windfall catapults them into 703rd place in the UK's rich list

Mr Leeman said he returned home one night to find his clothes thrown outside in bags.

Steven, now 17, claimed when he  had 
arrived hom from a school trip to France he found his father had gone.

When he asked his mother where he was, he claimed:  ‘She packed my bags 
and told me if I didn’t like it I should go’.

While the couple have been catapulted up the rich list they are only Britain's third biggest jackpot winners.

Colin and Chris Weir (pictured), from Largs, Scotland, won £161m in July while another single ticket holder collected £113m a year ago.

The biggest ever win was £195million won in 2002 by Andrew Whittaker, from West Virginia.

Elaine and Harold Messner from New Jersey shared the world’s largest lottery prize of £250m when they won the Mega Millions draw in March 2007. However, the prize was shared further with an anonymous truck driver from Georgia.

A single ticket claimed by eight co-workers from a Nebraska meat processing plant won £234m in February 2006. Larry and Nancy Ross from Michigan and Joe and Sue Kainz from Illinois shared the £232m jackpot from The Big Game in May 2000.

A £154m Mega Millions prize pool was shared by two winners from Georgia and New Jersey in January 2011.

Mr Leeman accused his ex-wife, who 
had told reporters of her work at a British Heart Foundation shop, of 
‘preaching on TV about doing charity work’.

He added:  ‘I don’t want her
money, but I want her to do right by her son.

‘Angela loved going out clubbing and drinking, having a child just got in the way of her fun.

‘During his school holidays, she 
would force me to take Steven in the lorry with me so he would be out of
the way when she went out to have fun.

‘She has neglected her own son very 
badly. It is not right. She needs to recognise her son, rather than 
trying to change her identity in the way she has. Instead she is rubbing
this in our faces.’

Miss Dawes, who has changed her name 
to that of her fiance, said: ‘I’m saddened by these reports - a lot of 
what has been said since my divorce has been untrue and very hurtful.

‘I’ve always wanted to be in contact with my son, who I love dearly, and very much still want to rebuild our relationship.’

The
biggest ever EuroMillions prize won in Britain was a £161million 
jackpot won by Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Scotland, back in 
July.

The second largest was claimed by a 
single ticket-holder, who chose to remain anonymous after scooping £113m
in October last year.

The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK won £84million last May.

In
February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, 
broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest 
prize in the history of EuroMillions. 

The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009.  

The millionaires will now be able to 
buy six of the world’s most expensive watches – a diamond-encrusted 
timepiece from Chopard costing £15millon each.

Or they could treat themselves to 720
pairs of the world’s most expensive shoes – the £140,000 
diamond-encrusted heels made by the House of Borgezie.

They could also buy 600 top-of-the-range sports cars – the Ferrari 458 Italia costs a mere £170,000.

For a party to celebrate the win, they could easily afford Barbadian singer Rihanna, who charges £500,000 for a performance. But
if they wish to avoid long-lost family members who are no doubt set to 
come out of the woodwork, the winners could escape to their own private 
island, such as £100million Rangyai near Phuket in Thailand.

The 110-acre private island boasts white beaches as well as tropical forests.
