Bill and Hillary Clinton are making the most of their downtime in the Hamptons.

The former U.S. President and his ex-Secretary of State wife were pictured this morning enjoying a stroll on the beach in Amagansett, where they are paying $100,000 to rent an $18million five-bedroom property for three weeks.

The couple, who were accompanied by their dogs as well as a Secret Service agent, were dressed in very casual clothes, with President Clinton decked out in black SoulCycle shorts and green sneakers and his wife in a bright blue muumuu and slippers.

Mrs Clinton, 66, kept her eyes shaded from the sun with oversized dark sunglasses and a straw visor.

The political pair have sparked a bit of controversy recently after it was revealed that they are paying $100,000 for their three-week stay - just weeks after Mrs Clinton claimed that they were 'dead broke' after leaving the White House in 2000.

But they didn't look as if they had a care in the world as they enjoyed the seaside fresh air.

The former President held onto a cup of coffee and kept a leash dangling from his neck as their dogs happily ran free in the sand.

The property that they are staying in for the remainder of the month is owned by Republican donor Andre Nasser and his wife Lois.

It is situated on the top of a bluff, 200 feet up, overlooking Gardiners Bay and Gardiners Island in what's known as the Bell Estate.

Located at 44 Broadview Road, the home is next door to movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is a noted Democrat supporter and longtime close friend of the Clintons.

And they 
may well run into Mr Weinstein at the upcoming Clinton Foundation 
fundraiser on Saturday at the home of George and Joan Hornig in Water 
Mill.

Tickets start at $5,000 a person and soar up to $50,000 a couple for a seat at the head table and an invitation to the Clinton Foundationâ€™s annual spring briefing in 2015.

Mrs Clinton, who has just finished an international book tour to promote her tome, Hard Choices, will also be at the bookshop Bookhampton on August 16 to sign copies of the new memoir (fans will have to buy copies before being allowed in).
