An innocent 15-year-old girl, Leanne Walters died when she was shot in the face in broad daylight, when a Milperra carpark was turned into a savage battleground during the 1984 'Milperra Massacre.'

The brutal battle remains the world’s worst ever outbreak of bikie violence – yet it was all for ‘nothing, really,’ according to the man many believe is responsible for the bloody showdown that claimed seven lives.

Seven people were killed, 28 injured and 43 men charged with murder.

That man, the founder of bikie gang the Comancheros, William George ‘Jock’ Ross insists he expected ‘nothing’ would happen that day, despite leading his heavily armed men to meet their arch rivals.

'We came to be seen, not to fight. We were armed only for defence,’ Ross told 60 Minutes, breaking his silence of 30 years.

‘(The Bandidos) attacked us, they had the choice. We didn’t have the choice. What was I meant to do, put my arms in the air and be cut to bits?’

This Tuesday marks 30 years since the horrific Father’s Day massacre, when two bikie gangs, the Comancheros and the Bandidos used guns, knifes, lead pipes and various other weapons to wreak havoc on a quiet suburb, invading a ‘part swap’ at Viking Tavern in Sydney’s south west.

The case's crucial witness, Linda Motten, has come forward for the first time to tell her story – revealing the lasting trauma she experienced after witnessing the destruction of the bikie war.

‘It was just a family day that turned to hell,’ Ms Motten told 60 Minutes.

‘There were so many children there. People were throwing children over the fence. There was a pregnant woman lying in the middle of the car park.’

From underneath a car, Linda Motten took photos of the crime that were crucial evidence that led to the conviction of the bikies from the two gangs involved in the massacre

Ms Motten, who was 22-years-old at the time of the murders, was sitting in her car when the bikie gangs began their battle.

She witnessed the scene unfold and provided the key witness account and only photographic evidence of the crime, which led to the conviction of 43 men.

‘The noise was incredible, not just the shots. There were people smashing each other with lead pipes, baseball bats, chains, anything.

‘People were screaming in agony. It all happened so quickly, you’d blink and there’d be three people lying in the middle of the carpark,' said Ms Motten.

After Ms Motten’s windscreen was shattered by a bullet, covering her in shards of glass, she fled for safety behind a caravan.

It was at that moment that she had the ‘clarity’ of mind to grab her camera and, from beneath a van, take photographs of the barbaric scene – with the explicit purpose of exposing those responsible.

‘I thought, “I’m not going to let them get away with this”’

‘I tried to get photos of men with firearms still in their hands so I could later say, “that man shot that man with that gun,”’ said Ms Motten.

The brutal scene was something that 'noting could have prepared us for,' according to Senior Constable John Garvey, who worked on the case and witnessed the shocking violence

She took seven photos which were damning for the suspects, who underwent a 13 month trial – the longest in NSW history.

‘It was the only weapon I had and I was going to shoot back,’ Ms Motten told 60 Minutes.

Detective Senior Constable John Garvey witnessed the indescribable scenes and managed to finally stop the bloodshed.

‘Nothing on the trip over (to the carpark), nothing, could have prepared us for what we walked into,’ Constable Garvey explains.

Constable Garvey worked on the investigation that put 43 of the bikies culpable behind bars.

Ross received a life sentence but served only 5 years 3 months, as his murder charge was downgraded to manslaughter and his sentence was shortened due to good behaviour.

Garvey is certain that Ross knew exactly what was going to unfold that fateful day, and believes the 71-year-old grandfather has blood on his hands today.

‘Jock Ross is a very intelligent, very calculating and very dominant figure who is responsible for what happened that day.’

Ross maintained his control of the gang during his time in jail, and only retired as their leader in 2003. He still wears his gang colours.

Ross returned to the scene of the massacre for the first time since the killings with the program.

Ross insists that when he arrived at the fateful car park, he did not expect for any violence to erupt, despite he and his gang all arriving heavily armed to meet with their arch enemies

Ms Motten says she no longer lives in fear after spending 25 years ‘looking over shoulder.’

She could not escape the horror of the bikie war, as bikies made threats on her life, leading to repeated moves and jobs changes, to remain inconspicuous.

However, she knew she had no option but to expose the bikies’ crimes and every detail she could possibly recount during the trial.

She believes the victims have been forgotten as time has passed.

‘It was important to remember the innocent people that were out there. I think the victims have been lost in this,’ Ms Motten said.

For Leanne’s father, Rex Walters, his daughter will never be forgotten. He also spoke with 60 Minutes to honour his daughter’s memory.

Mr Walters has been left with nothing, except the clothes his daughter was wearing on the day she was killed and the Father’s Day present, a photo frame, that Leanne had planned to give to Rex that day.

Thirty years later, his mind still wanders. Looking at her clothes, he says ‘I can imagine what she would have looked like that day.’

For Leanne's father, there is no forgetting.
