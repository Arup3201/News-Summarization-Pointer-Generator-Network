It is the dilemma faced by thousands of shoppers when searching for a new gadget for the home.

Whether buying a camcorder or coffee maker, a DVD player or dishwasher, is it a good idea to plump for the most expensive brand, stick with the names you trust, or take a chance on the cheapest model and hope for the best?

The average price of a festive basket of food and drink is a hefty 19.5per cent higher than last Christmas.

Asda came out best value for a trolley of 33 festive essentials, which totted up to £127.40 - £4.32 less than second-placed Morrisons, £9.85 less than biggest chain Tesco, £21.60 less than Sainsbury's and a whopping £40.04 less than upmarket Waitrose.

Asda also had the cheapest offers on festive drinks though, Morrisons has the cheapest small turkey at £8.33, compared with Asda at £10, Sainsbury's for £13.24 and Tesco £15.00 while at Waitrose they were £17.01.

But the basket compiled annually by trade magazine The Grocer, while not strictly comparing like with like, cost on average £142.36 this year, a staggering 19.5per cent hike on last year's average across the five major chains of £119.18.

However the cost of alcohol was down, along with the Alka Seltzer for the cost festive hangover.

Asda was selling champagne for £12 a bottle, merlot for £4 and sauvignon blanc for £6, Bailey's Irish Cream for £10 and Ruby Port for £6.32.

Own-label Christmas puddings were just £5 at Asda, matched only by Tesco, and along with Sainsbury's the cheapest mince pies at £1.

But now there’s no excuse to be baffled as the country’s consumer experts have produced a list of the 50 best buys of the year.

The top household products have been compiled by Which? magazine after researchers tested 2,700 makes and models under strict laboratory conditions.

Which? says everything from headphones, laser printers, vacuum cleaners and baby monitors were put through their paces before they could be deemed a best buy.

The list is based on the goods being the most efficient, the best value for money, the least likely to go wrong, and the most likely to do the job properly. For customers looking to replace a broken-down washing machine or buy a present for a loved one, it could take the guesswork out of the dazzling array of items on the shelves.

The winners range from a 55in Samsung television priced at £2,500 to a pack of Energizer rechargeable batteries worth £8.

The best toaster costs just £28, compared with some models on sale for twice as much. In contrast, the top tumble dryer, from German manufacturer Miele, costs £1,269, which is considerably more expensive than rival machines.

Most brand names on the list, including Apple, Bosch and Bose, are well known to British consumers, while those such as Rancilio, the Italian-based coffee machine maker, are less so.

The list may prompt householders to check which makes and models they own themselves, or perhaps act as a reminder about what they should get next time.

But be warned: buying the best doesn’t come cheap.Purchasing every item on the list contained in the panel would cost almost £19,500.

Some categories, such as fridge-freezers, were omitted from the list because no particular model was deemed a best buy.

‘They either didn’t make the grade, or lacked sufficient reliability data,’ said a Which? spokesman.

Meanwhile, Cyber Monday last week saw Amazon.co.uk receive orders for over three million items, which is the most amount of items ever to be ordered in a single day.

The £89 Kindle was the best selling product of the day.
