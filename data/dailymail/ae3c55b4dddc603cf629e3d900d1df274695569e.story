Morocco have appealed against sanctions levied by the African Football Confederation following the decision to withdraw from hosting this year's African Nations Cup.

The Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FMRF) announced in November that it would not be going ahead with the tournament which started in January due to fears over the ongoing ebola outbreak in West Africa.

Equatorial Guinea eventually stepped in as replacement hosts but CAF came down hard on the Moroccan governing body, banning its national side from the next two editions of the competition and imposing fines and compensation orders totalling almost £7million.

The FMRF has taken the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, requesting the penalties be rescinded by the end of next month.

A statement from CAS read: 'The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has registered an appeal filed by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation against the sanctions which were imposed on it by the African Football Confederation (CAF) following the decision of the FRMF not to organise the 2015 edition of the African Cup of Nations due to the Ebola virus epidemic.

'In its appeal to the CAS, the FRMF requests the annulment of the challenged decisions and that a final award be issued by the end of March 2015.

'An arbitration procedure has been opened and is being conducted according to the Code of Sports-related Arbitration.'

The FRMF last week posted a statement on its website registering its shock at the measures taken by CAF.

'The executive committee is said to be greatly surprised by the decisions taken by CAF,' it read.

'They do not correspond in any way to the conclusions of the first meeting in Cairo with the president of CAF.

'(We will) take all necessary measures to uphold the rights and interests of Moroccan football and provisions.'
