Tragic: Jena Dolstad,14, died after being injected with heroin

A 14-year-old Alaskan girl has died six days after she was allegedly injected with heroin by a 26-year-old.

Jena Dolstad of Anchorage had been critical since she was taken to the hospital last Friday with a drug overdose. 

The teenager died shortly after noon today (Thursday), police spokeswoman Anita Shell said.

On the tragic night which would lead to her death, Navy Veteran Sean Warner and two other men picked Jena up and took her back to Warner's home to hang out, according to police reports. 

Warner was sharing a gram of heroin with two men when the Jena said she was willing to try something 'new' but did not want to inject herself, the court papers report.

Warner tried to inject Jena, but 
failed, so he had her lie down on his bed and hold out an arm, then used
his belt as a tourniquet and shot 25 to 30 units of heroin, taking 
several times to find a vein, the papers say.

The two witnesses told authorities they 
left the Jena on the bed and 
found her the next morning, face down in her own vomit.

'They felt for her pulse, sat her up, 
and grew concerned at her condition and upset at Warner's ambivalence,' 
the documents state.

Warner initially did not want to call 
911 because of fears authorities would find drugs, and instead gave the 
teen Suboxone, a prescription drug used to treat opiate addicts, according to the court papers.

He only called
911 after Jena began to convulse a couple of hours after he gave 
her the Suboxone, the papers say.

Sean Warner is under arrest on charges of delivering a controlled substance to a minor, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and evidence tampering.

With the death, Warner now faces additional charges, including manslaughter, said assistant District Attorney Regan Williams.

The case is still in the "investigatory stages," he said.

When emergency services attended his address to tend to Jena, Warner locked his bedroom door, and responding officers did not search it when he told them it was his roommate's room, the documents state.

After police left, Warner and one of the witnesses put needles and other "related evidence" into a box then dumped it behind a trash bin at a nearby business, according to the papers, which police later recovered.

Dolstad was found to have heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine in her system when she was brought to the hospital, charging documents said. 

Medics told authorities she had sustained damage to her brain and heart.

Authorities have said the heroin used is known on the street at "China White," considered more potent than common tar heroin.

Warner also is charged with theft, accused of stealing a $900 surveillance system from Costco on the same day he took the girl to his home, according to the documents. He is being held on $100,000 cash bail.
