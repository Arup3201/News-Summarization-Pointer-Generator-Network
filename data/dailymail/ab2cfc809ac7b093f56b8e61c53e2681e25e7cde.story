Caretaker Rangers boss Kenny McDowall insists his side can cope without Lewis Macleod.

The promising midfielder is on the verge of a £1million move to Brentford.

The 20-year-old underwent a medical with the SkyBet Championship outfit on Tuesday but is expected to agree terms later on Wednesday.

The Scotland Under 21 international's exit would be a major blow for McDowall with his side desperately short on creative options.

But with the club in a deep financial crisis, the seven-figure price tag has proved too good to turn down.

McDowall, though, insists he has enough in reserve to manage without Macleod.

Speaking at the pre-match press conference for Saturday's Scottish Championship clash with Dumbarton, he said: 'I believe Lewis went down yesterday and had a medical and [the transfer] is pending a medical at this time.

'It would be naturally a blow to see him go. He is a talented lad and he's got the opportunity to move on, which looks like it may now be the case.

'It's disappointing to lose him but that is football. You have got to move on.

'Lewis is one of our top players but it is also an opportunity for someone else to come into the team and stake a claim. So nothing has changed. We are still a good team.

'It's not one player which makes our team. We have a lot of good players in that changing room.

'We're sorry to lose him if that is the case but we will move on.'
