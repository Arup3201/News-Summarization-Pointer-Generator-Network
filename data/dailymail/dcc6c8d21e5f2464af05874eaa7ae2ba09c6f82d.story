A massive European night at Anfield – surely every football lover can’t wait for these games?

You’ve got to be a hard-boiled hater of Liverpool Football Club if you’re not wildly excited about the prospect of the European champions Real Madrid, featuring arguably the world’s finest player in Cristiano Ronaldo, turning up at the historic and celebrated home of England’s finest European ambassadors over the years.

The truth is that those massive European nights are only remembered if they are successful.

The Champions League semi-final against Chelsea in 2005, the group win against Olympiacos before that, St Etienne and super-sub David Fairclough in 1977, 4-0 against Real Madrid in 2009 – all great European nights at Anfield, all victories.

And Brendan Rodgers desperately needs a big European performance this week. Liverpool stumbled past Ludogorets, and then failed miserably in Basle. The Reds need to breathe life into their European adventure, and what better stage to do that than when the football world’s eyes will be watching – at Anfield against the continent's finest.

Rodgers’ team might not win the Champions League this season, but he needs to have a competitive European campaign.

Bill Shankly built the Anfield empire, Bob Paisley and then Joe Fagan carried it on. Kenny Dalglish continued the domestic domination. Since that long period of glory, only Rafa Benitez qualifies as a great Liverpool manager, and that’s because he won the Champions League.

Rodgers is a student of the game, and he has been smart enough to fully acquaint himself with Liverpool’s history and tradition. Rodgers knows what makes this great club tick, and he knows what will feed the fervour of the fans. He’s immersed himself in all things good about Liverpool past and present.

Last season won Rodgers a lot of friends.

The title looks a long way off, so he can only enhance his reputation with a memorable European campaign.

Six points from two games against Ronaldo and Real is exactly what Liverpool need. It’s a big ask.

But taking his team into the top four last season was also a big ask for Rodgers. And he almost won them the title.

This is Rodgers’ big stage. He’s travelled the world educating himself about football. He’s dreamed of nights like these. Let’s see what he’s got.
