Newcomers to Northern Territory roads might be surprised to find themselves overtaking BIGNOSE, tailgating YOLO, or feeling inferior to ADONIS.

Cars just have more personality in the NT, and one woman was so taken with the personalised number plates that she has collected a gallery of almost 10,000 and published a book displaying some of the best.

Number Plate Stories of the NT was launched in Darwin on Wednesday by Irish-born Vivien Joseph, who moved to the top end in 2011 after a redundancy and immediately began tracking the plates.

Ms Joseph has launched her book, Number Plate Stories of the NT, after spending three years documenting the wildly popular form of self-expression

'It was the first thing that caught my attention. It's one of the most loveable things about the NT,' Ms Joseph said. 

Personalised plates in the NT only cost about $178, a fraction of the $500 or so they cost in other states.

Ms Joseph thinks affordability is a key factor, as well as the quirky, non-conformist attitude of Territorians.

'The stories are always surprising,' she said.

Many plates are references to family in-jokes and nicknames, such as the multi-generational plates of the Butt family: Dad is HEDBUTT, Mum is MYBUTT and their son is, simply, BUTT.

Businesses also exploit the advertising potential: Look no further than SMILEDR the dentist, HITMAN the pest controller, or POOGURU the plumber.

Even the NT Police are on the bandwagon, with WATCHNU.

Ms Joseph has spotted ASUWISH, from a Princess Bride fanatic, and BADNANA, whose grandchildren bought her the plates after she snuck alcohol into an Elton John concert.

Deciphering the plates has become a fun way to pass what are often long stretches in the car.

There's the coffee-loving CAFIEND and the resigned YESDARL.

You might see the Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy fan who reminds motorists of the ultimate answer to all questions in the universe with LIFE 42.

There are the ultra-macho, such as PWRFUL, GOTNADS, and REDBALL, a ute which proudly dangles a set of red plastic testicles.

There's the pink Hyundai TICKLED, and the red Suzuki jeep PUNKROK, which incongruously bears a Team Edward Twilight sticker.

Cruising the streets of Darwin, one might be exhorted to COPTHAT, COMEON, CRANKIT, JAMIT, or be charmed by FULISIK and BOGAN.

'Is it that when you move up here you become a bit bolder, a bit more creative? Is it that the spirit of things up here makes you feel freer to do things that are more fun? I don't know,' said Ms Joseph, aka PL8LADY.
