David Cameron's advisor on child abuse Claire Perry said there was a 'chumocracy' in Westminster looking to protect itself from paedophile claims

David Cameron's advisor on child abuse has lashed out at the Westminster 'chumocracy' that has protected itself from allegations of paedophilia.

Tory junior minister Claire Perry said Parliament was full of 'too many people with the same interests and the same out-of-touch sense of entitlement coming together to protect their own'.

Her damning remarks come amid allegations that a paedophile network was operating in Westminster and was being protected by senior politicians.

Home Secretary Theresa May this week launched an inquiry into organisations including churches, the security services and the BBC.

A separate review will also examine the failures in Westminster to properly investigate allegations of sexual abuse.

It came after it emerged last week that an explosive dossier of papers allegedly naming high-profile child abusers in Westminster had been handed to the Home Office in the 1980s - but had since gone missing.

Miss Perry, the MP for Devizes, questioned why it has taken so long to take the allegations seriously.

Writing in her local newspaper The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald she said: 'Why has it taken so many years for allegations to be believed and action to be taken?

'Part of the problem can be traced, in my view, to the ‘chumocracy’ that for too long has been at the heart of the so-called Establishment, consisting of too many people with the same interests and the same out-of-touch sense of entitlement coming together to protect their own.

'It is this sort of persistent ‘otherness’ that so many of us are determined to change, to make the system more representative, more real and more normal. Some may say we have not succeeded yet but we will keep on trying.'

Miss Perry added: 'The other, and more worrying part of the problem is the way that the voices of victims were ignored for so long – children told to keep quiet, ridiculed, or threatened – with tragically the most vulnerable of all being more likely to be targeted for abuse.

'That, to me, is the real scandal and we must do all we can to make sure that when victims speak out they are heard and action is taken.”

Home Secretary Theresa May last week unveiled two investigations into allegations of historic child abuse

Miss Perry also raised concerns about cyberbullying and online grooming.'

She said: 'There are not just historic cases to be considered and for many it is the replacement of the ‘known’ worries with those that are less quantifiable in the modern world, like cyberbullying or online grooming where children are flattered, cajoled and sometimes threatened into meeting predators online or in the real world with serious and damaging consequences.

'The new raft of online safety measures and better education of parents and children about cyber dangers will help, but it is a reminder that technology amplifies the threats to children that have existed in the offline world for a very long time.'
