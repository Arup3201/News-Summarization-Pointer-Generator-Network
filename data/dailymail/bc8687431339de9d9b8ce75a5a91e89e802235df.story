It is a statement on the size of Sir Ben Ainslie’s challenge that the Duchess of Cambridge’s husband is the great, great, great, great-grandson of the Queen who first watched Britain lose what became known as the America’s Cup.

That was on the misty Solent in 1851 when Queen Victoria asked who was in second place. ‘Your Majesty, there is no second,’ she was told.

The schooner America, which saluted the Queen by dipping its ensign three times, beat the Royal Yacht, winning a victory for the new world over the old and ending Britain’s supremacy of the seas.

Will to win: Sir Ben Ainslie is desperate to win the America's Cup for Great Britain

Patriotic: Ainslie turned down more lucrative offers to lead a team representing Great Britain

We have not won the America’s Cup from that day to this.

So on Tuesday in Greenwich — in the appropriately august setting of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, and accompanied by the Duchess of  Cambridge, herself a keen sailor — Ainslie launched his team for the 35th America’s Cup by saying: ‘We want to right a wrong and bring the Cup back to British waters for the first time. That is our goal.

‘As a country we have won the World Cups in rugby and football, Wimbledon, the Tour de France, but this is the last great historic prize never won by Great Britain.’

Ainslie’s desire to win the Cup for Britain caused him to turn down lucrative offers — potentially worth £2million — to compete as a hired hand for one of the other competitors, as he did when he helped Oracle Team USA to their astonishing 9-8 victory from 8-1 down last year.

‘There were other teams on the markets and we did have a few discussions,’ he  said, ‘but I wanted to do this as a British skipper, not for any other country.’ He also feels a deep personal motivation. He has been entranced by the America’s Cup since, when aged 12, he saw Victory 83, the yacht owned by Peter de Savary, ‘I dreamed about doing this and read all the books about it,’ he said.

The prize itself, the 4ft tall silver Cup, which is known as the Auld Mug and is kept in the New York Yacht Club, was flown to London in its own first class seat. A guard even slept with it overnight. In the Greenwich sun, it was handled carefully by two men in white gloves and placed between Ainslie and the Duchess for the photographers to capture.

To try to win it for Britain, Ainslie is pulling together an £80million bid drawn from private and  commercial sources. Part of that fortune is in place or underwritten; the rest, he hopes, will follow.

Sir Charles Dunstone, the Carphone Warehouse founder, and Sir Keith Mills, the entrepreneur who was instrumental in bringing the Olympics to London, have  contributed to the fund. Both are avid sailors and were involved in the last — aborted — British bid in the guise of Team Origin.

Ainslie’s cache as the most decorated Olympic sailor in history, has helped him to poach some impressive crew members. They include the powerful Kiwi Jono Macbeth, who has won the Cup three times — the first man Ainslie phoned as he assembled his star cast.

As well as another New Zealander, Andy McLean, British sailors David Carr and Nick Hutton, both of whom competed in the event last year, and Matt Cornwell, the world match race champion, are in place.

Carr was particularly pleased that the Duchess complimented him on his thick-rim glasses.

‘She said it was a good look,’ he reported afterwards.

The protocol, as the rules are known, stipulate that 25 per cent of the eight-man crew must be  British. That is at least an improvement on the last staging of the event, when there was no eligibility regulation at all.

‘I’d like as many British guys involved as possible,’ said Ainslie, though he is aware — as are  Dunstone and Mills on the  commercial side — that to succeed they must embrace the inter-national possibilities open to them.

The design team is crucial for an AC62 wingsail catamaran.

Ainslie will draw heavily from Formula One to get every aerodynamic advantage he can. These boats travel 10 miles in 25 minutes. In 1851 it took them 11hr 37m to circumnavigate the Isle of Wight. What next? The British bid is likely to be based in Portsmouth. Their racing programme in the America’s Cup World Series in 2015 and 2016 will include about six events a year.

There will then be a qualifying series in 2017, from which a challenger will emerge to take on Oracle in the America’s Cup Match itself.

And the name of the boat?

Ainslie said he will write Rita —the moniker he gives to all his crafts — in Tipp-Ex somewhere  unobtrusive for tradition’s sake, but the official name is likely to be grander. The Duchess, perhaps.
