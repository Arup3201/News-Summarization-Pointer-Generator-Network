Two councillors who failed to pay their council tax have been granted anonymity – because naming and shaming them in court would violate their human rights.

The pair owe a total of £4,660 but a senior judge said unmasking them risks causing ‘unnecessary and unjustified damage and distress’.

Campaigners yesterday condemned the ruling as evidence of a worrying culture of secrecy – saying the public must know the identity of elected politicians who don’t pay the tax they help to set.

Failure to pay: Two councillors from Bolton Council (pictured) failed to pay a total of £4,660 in council tax. But they have been granted anonymity - because naming them in court would violate their human rights

The councillors, one Labour and one 
Conservative, had been summoned to court in Bolton and arranged to pay 
their arrears in full for the periods 2011/12 and 2012/13.

While their names would have been given on the day of the hearings, the cases were not reported at the time.

The matter only came to light last 
year when local newspaper the Bolton News made a Freedom of Information 
request to Bolton council.

But when the Labour-controlled 
authority refused to identify the duo, citing data protection laws, the 
paper complained to the .

Criticism: Andy Silvester (pictured), of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said Bolton taxpayers would find the judge's ruling 'thoroughly depressing'

The newspaper argued that there was a
 strong public interest in disclosing the pair’s names as both could 
have been standing for re-election in May.

In his ruling, the commissioner said 
it was ‘reasonable’ for someone in elected office to expect that failure
 to pay would be made public.

But he added that council tax was a 
‘private matter’ between residents and the local authority, and said the
 personal circumstances given by the councillors as mitigating factors 
were such that naming them would be ‘unfair’.

A First-tier Tribunal, which hears appeals against the decisions of public bodies, later backed the anonymity ruling.

Unusually, the council’s lawyers even asked if they could contribute to the decision-making process.

In a written judgment, Judge Robin 
Callender Smith said the circumstances of the councillors’ cases put 
them in a position where they could ‘significantly and legitimately have
 expected not to be named’.

Citing the European Convention of 
Human Rights, he added: ‘Releasing the information could potentially 
cause unnecessary and unjustified damage and distress to the 
individuals.’

There are now no further appeal 
stages available, so the councillors’ identity will remain a secret. 
While their mitigation has not been disclosed, personal information 
covered under data protection laws includes confidential medical issues.

Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, blasted a lack of ‘transparency and accountability’, adding: 
‘Bolton taxpayers will find this whole episode thoroughly depressing. 
Those who have paid their fair share deserve to know which of their 
councillors aren’t doing the same.’

Councillors in Bolton receive a basic
 annual allowance of £11,082, with additional payments for chairing 
committees or cabinet duties.

Christine Melsom, of anti-council tax
 campaign group Is It Fair?, said: ‘When they’re getting allowances of 
more than £11,000 a year, the least people can expect is for them to pay
 on time.’

Bolton Council declined to say 
whether the pair were among the two councillors who lost their seats in 
May’s elections. It also refused to say how much it spent fighting the 
case.

But it said the tribunal ruling was correct, adding: ‘We take our responsibility to protect personal data very seriously.’

The ICO said the decision struck the ‘right balance between openness and accountability and personal privacy rights’.
