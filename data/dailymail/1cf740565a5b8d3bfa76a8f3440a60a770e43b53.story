After more than six months at sea, a 67-year-old Polish adventurer paddled his kayak into New Smyrna Beach on Saturday to mark the end of a 6,000-mile trans-Atlantic journey, looking like a castaway.

Aleksander 'Olek' Doba kissed the ground after he landed. He was greeted by hundreds of cheering supporters. A flotilla of fellow kayakers joined him as he paddled into the marina.

His skin was bronzed and weathered, his beard long and tangled, but his mood was triumphant after completing a journey across one of the world's roughest oceans.

Triumphant: To the cheers of hundreds of supporters on the water in kayaks and on land holding signs, Polish adventurer Aleksander Doba paddled into New Smyrna Beach Marina on Saturday after a more than 6,000-mile journey across the vast Atlantic Ocean alone in a kayak

What a trip! Doba left Lisbon, Portugal on October 5, with the goal of making the more than 6,500 mile crossing, however he was forced to stop in Bermuda for repairs to his 21-foot kayak from February 13 to March 23 after harsh weather damaged his rudder

The Polish explorer should arrived at New Smyrna at the weekend. He told the crowd that completing the trans-Atlantic voyage was his dream.

'The feeling I had when I (arrived) here in New Smyrna Beach was fantastic, so many people, so friendly,' he said.

Doba left Lisbon, Portugal on October 5, with the goal of making the more than 6,500 mile crossing, however he was forced to stop in Bermuda for repairs to his 21-foot kayak from February 13 to March 23 after harsh weather damaged his rudder.

He also experienced equipment issues and was unable to send messages for 47 days. But he reached Bermuda, where he spent a month while repairs were made.

Castaway: Sporting a beard he said that he had barely slept on the six-month long crossing

Heroic journey: He said the most-difficult part of his trip was navigating through the choppy waters of the Gulf Stream just days before he reached the Florida coast

Home for six months! Aleksander Doba sailed 6,000 miles across the Atlantic in this tiny kayak

While in Bermuda he still managed to live off the rations that he packed in Portugal — before setting out again to complete the journey.

His paddle from Portugal to Bermuda is believed to be the longest open-water kayak crossing in history.

He said the most-difficult part of his trip was navigating through the choppy waters of the Gulf Stream just days before he reached the Florida coast.

In December, he refused a rescue attempt by members of a commercial tanker after issuing an SOS signal, about midway across the Atlantic.

He told the crew that his satellite navigation equipment wasn’t working properly, but that he was proceeding anyway.

According to Canoe & Kayak magazine, even the last few days of fighting the Gulf Stream proved extremely challenging.

Back on dry land: The 67-year-old Polish adventurer paddled his kayak into the record books as he landed at New Smyrna Beach on Saturday to mark the end of a 6,000-mile, trans-Atlantic journey

'For five months we worried about crossing the Gulf Stream,' Piotr Chmielinski, who has helped manage Doba’s expedition and served as translator, told Canoe & Kayak. 'If he got northerly winds, the current and winds fight each other and you get choppy, breaking son-of-a-gun waves'

Among those who greeted Doba on Saturday was Marianne McCormick of Port Orange. McCormick said she has followed Doba's adventure since November.

'I wouldn't miss this for the world. My husband wanted to play golf. I said, 'I'm coming here,' ' said McCormick, who took pictures of the celebration with her iPad.

Mary "Snookie" DeMarce, of Edgewater, brought a sign that read "Olek, you're my hero.'

'Yes, he's an inspiration because I'm 65,' she said.

New Smyrna Beach Mayor Adam Barringer shook Doba's hand, calling him 'Aleksander the Great.' Barringer read a proclamation in Doba's honor and presented him with a bottle of champagne on behalf of the city.

He was also presented with honorary membership into the Smyrna Yacht Club.

Doba started paddling at the age of 40 and, according to his son, lived by this motto: “It’s better to live one day as a lion than a thousand years as a lamb.”

He completed his first trans-Atlantic expedition in February 2011 when he kayaked 3,900 miles from Senegal, Africa, to Brazil — a 99-day journey.
