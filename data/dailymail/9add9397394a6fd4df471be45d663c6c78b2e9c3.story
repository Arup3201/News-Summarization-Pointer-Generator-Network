An autopsy was inconclusive, the medical examiner’s office said on Monday, and the cause of death is still being investigated.

'I want someone to please speak up,' said Shaniesha’s sister, Shanah Forbes, reported New York Daily News.

'She didn’t deserve this.'

An unidentified law enforcement source told the Post that the deceased girl was the niece of an NYPD sergeant.

The schoolgirl's friends said she had recently suffered at the hands of school bullies.

'Almost every day in science class, they would ask her the same questions . . . like why she would wear the same weave over and over again,' her friend Tanasha Searls, 14, told the newspaper.

'I felt it was wrong for them to do. She was a really sweet person.'

Another friend, Jonathan Ho, 16, said the teenager, who vanished on her way to school, had a boyfriend and had relationship troubles.
