A thug who brutally attacked six women - including his own sister and a girl who refused to kiss him at a party - has got off with a 14-month sentence.

The judge said Sam Brownless, 22, deserved longer behind bars but he was restricted by official sentencing guidelines after the attacks were charged lower-level common assaults.

Victims groups have criticised the sentence, saying it shows how rules need to be changed to allow the justice system to impose the punishments criminals deserve.

The court heard Brownless, of Hartlepool, County Durham, attacked four women in a late night attack in September, before beating up his sister in November, and punching another victim at a party in February this year.

He admitted six counts of common assault and breaching a suspended sentence.

But Judge David Hatton said Brownless could only be jailed for a maximum of six months for the attacks as they were classed as low level 'summary offences', which he pleaded guilty to before magistrates.

Brownless was only jailed for the longer term of 14 months because the judge activated a previously suspended prison sentence from when Brownless crashed a car into a care home.

Sentencing rules also mean that, 
providing he behaves behind bars, Brownless could be released on licence
 after serving just half of his prison term.

Domestic violence charity Harbour hit
 out at the sentence and called for the system to be changed so the 
punishment can fits the crime.

Teesside Crown Court heard that the judge was limited in the sentence he could impose because the attacks were charged as 'summary' common assaults

Spokesman Denise Chadwick: 'It is really worrying. The justice system needs to be reviewed in individual cases like this so the courts can actually give out sentences that reflect the catalogue of abuse that he has obviously carried out.'

Guidelines state that the 'summary offence' of common assault has a maximum sentence of six months.

They encourage judges to impose a community order unless the offence involves a 'greater degree of harm'.

Longer sentences of up to five years can only be imposed if the attack is charged as an 'assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH)'.

Guidelines tell prosecutors to decide upon a charge based on ' the level of injuries that have resulted'.

Last September, Brownless lashed out at four young women at 3am after a run-in with one of the group.

He landed punches on each of the women's faces, leaving them with nosebleeds, swelling and pain which lasted for several days.

One said she was 'shocked that such a large man would assault girls in such a way'.

He had previously attacked his sister when she and his mum refused to hand over his six-month-old baby when he came home drunk from the pub.

Sue Jacobs, prosecuting, said: 'He grabbed his sister from behind and dragged her to the floor by her hair.

'He punched and kicked her about the body and stamped on her several times.'

Brownless' final attack was committed on a girl he tried to kiss at a house party.

When she rejected him, he ran at her and punched her to the mouth, nose and forehead causing her to fall to the floor, the court heard.

She suffered a burst lip, black eye and bruising around her mouth.

One of his victims said in a statement: 'I think it's disgusting that he would do that to girls. He's a bully and needs to learn he can't do that.'

Paul Cleasby, mitigating, said: 'When sober he's straight forward and rational. His family speak well of him when he is not in drink.'

Judge David Hatton said: 'I'm limited in the sentence that I can impose unfortunately because the appropriate sentence would be considerably higher and greater than that which I'm allowed to impose.'

Brownless's case is just the latest in recent weeks to spark anger among campaigners.

Earlier this month, killer Colin Noddings (pictured) walked free from court despite threatening the son of his former wife, Deana, after he was released from prison having served less than four years for her manslaughter.

Campaigners Civitas branded the six-month suspended sentence the 63-year-old was given 'a scandalously feeble response.'

The group's David Green said: 'The suspended sentence might as well have been an absolute discharge.'

It came after a judge apologised to the latest victims of armed robber Derek Rossi after he was released on licence from a second life sentence.

Rossi was given his third life term for a robbery of a London bookmakers last month, but Judge Peter Clarke admitted she should never have been freed at all.

He said to the victims: 'I wish to apologise to them on behalf of the criminal justice system for placing them in that position.'

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said of the judge's comments: 'This is a rare and brave example of a judge pointing out that soft sentences put the public at huge risk.'

It was also revealed last month that four out of five serial burglars now avoid prison or get off with short sentences.

Of the 993 serial burglars who were dealt with by the courts in 2011, only 214 were jailed for three years or more, figures show

The soft punishments were handed out despite a statement by then-Lord Chief Justice Igor Judge in 2009 urging judges to recognise the seriousness of burglary.

He said: â€˜Something precious is violated by burglary of a home and those who perpetrate this crime should be sentenced and punished accordingly.'
