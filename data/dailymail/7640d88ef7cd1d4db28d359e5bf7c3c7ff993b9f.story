Mario Balotelli will prove he is one of the best striker's in the world after ending his goal drought on Tuesday night, according to Liverpool team-mate Kolo Toure.

The Italian striker has come in for criticism having failed to impress since arriving at Anfield from AC Milan in the summer but managed to find the net against Swansea to help the Reds progress to the Capital One Cup quarter finals. 

Toure believes Balotelli's first goal in nine matches will give the frontman a boost and told the Liverpool Echo: 'Mario needs to feed himself by scoring goals. Now he's got that one he will do that now, definitely.

'Getting that goal will be fantastic for his confidence. He is a great player, he has just been lacking goals.

'We all know he's a top player. I always tell him 'you need to get out there and show you are one of the best players in the world'.

'He is one of the best. He has just been missing goals but they will come now.'
