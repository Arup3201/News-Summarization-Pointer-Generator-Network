Bernie Madoff’s widowed daughter-in-law today launched an explosive attack on how the disgraced financier ruined her family and told her mother-in-law she will never see her grandchildren again.

Stephanie Madoff Mack - whose husband Mark Madoff committed suicide last year, 18 months after his father was jailed for life - said their two children Audrey, 4, and Nicholas, 2, still miss their dad.

She said her late husband relentlessly followed news coverage about his father and failed in a 2009 suicide attempt, leaving a note saying his life was 'destroyed' and telling his dad: ‘F**k you’.

Stephanie, 37, of New York, told People magazine she feels ‘betrayed’ and has not forgiven her mother-in-law Ruth Madoff, or her husband’s brother Andrew, for allegedly abandoning Mark.

Earlier this week she became the first member of the family to grant an interview, telling ABC News she holds her father-in-law 'fully responsible for killing my husband’ and she would ‘spit in his face’.

She said her daughter Audrey sometimes shouts ‘I love you, daddy!’ in the sky and recently asked her: ‘Why didn’t daddy take his cell phone with him when he died?’, reported People magazine.

The couple wed in 2004 after meeting on a blind date when Stephanie worked in fashion and Mark worked in finance. But she said his ‘handsome face aged overnight’ when Bernie was jailed.

‘The smile that made me fall in love with him disappeared altogether,’ she wrote in her new book, adding that Mark would obsessively follow news reports in fear of being implicated in the scandal.

She said her husband was ‘in pure shock’
about his father’s lies. ‘He was enraged as well,’ Stephanie told ABC. 'Furious
that his father could've done this - destroyed so many lives and destroyed his.’

Stephanie said her husband physically 
changed as the charges against his father unravelled and he even grew a 
beard to disguise himself.

Mark described himself as ‘beyond devastated’ when he emailed her an article entitled ‘Madoff’s kin eyed as probe grinds on’, reported People magazine. She replied: ‘I cannot take this anymore!’

Mark hanged himself just hours later - and Stephanie, who is now studying childhood development at graduate school, said her daughter Audrey cried when she told her about his death.

Book: Stephanie is promoting her autobiography

Mark was found 
dead in his New York loft apartment on the second anniversary of his 
father's arrest last year - as their young son Nicholas slept in the 
next room.

Her mother-in-law Ruth was banned from 
Mark’s funeral by a furious Stephanie after flying from Florida to 
Connecticut to attend the service following his death last December.

She told ABC that she wrote Bernie a letter when he arrived in prison, describing his life without his two grandchildren - but he wrote back saying he was being treated like a celebrity in jail.

Stephanie has now made clear in interviews that her husband was tormented by the prospect of being locked up like his father, who is serving a 150-year sentence for masterminding a $60billion scam. She changed her surname to distance herself from 
the scandal.

‘(Bernie) stood there in the corner at my wedding watching
everyone dance, and he knew that everyone in that room was going to get screwed,’
she told ABC in an interview to be broadcast on Friday at 10pm Eastern Time.

After her husband's Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008, Ruth was warned by her sons Mark and Andrew to leave him or lose contact with them. At the time she chose her sons.

But after Bernie was attacked in prison in 2009 she returned to his side and her furious sons severed all ties with her. But Ruth has now stopped visiting in a bid to salvage a relationship with Andrew.

Stephanie is promoting her autobiography
‘The End Of Normal: A Wife’s Anguish, A Widow’s New Life’, which is 
coming out this week and is serialised in the latest issue of People magazine.

She told ABC she is determined to live the rest of her life
without ‘deceit, lies, betrayal and sorrow’.

An astonishing home video has been released of Stephanie and Mark Madoff’s wedding in 2004.

It shows Bernie showing his wife Ruth to her seat, then a smiling Stephanie walking down the aisle with her father. She is seen wearing a beautiful white dress and holding orange flowers.

She is accompanied by gospel choristers wearing purple, who enter singing: 'How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)' by Marvin Gaye.

Stephanie is then seen saying her wedding vows with Mark in front of a floral arch.

They are later videoed walking back down the aisle together and the wedding continues the Marvin Gaye theme with 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'.

The video then shows their first dance to Love's Divine by Seal, before Stephanie is seen dancing with Bernie as guests cheer them on to disco music.
