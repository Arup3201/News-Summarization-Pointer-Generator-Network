Sadly for the pensioner whose account received hundreds of millions of euros more than the intended transfer amount, the funds were quickly swept away again.

And the boss of the bank clerk who made the error was fired for letting the mistake slip through.

A court in the state of Hesse, central Germany, heard that the clerk was supposed to transfer just €62.40 (£53) from a bank account belonging to a retiree.

But instead 'fell asleep for an instant, while pushing onto the number 2 key on the keyboard'.

Error: The boss of a clerk who fell asleep while making a transfer - adding millions to a pensioner's account - was unfairly dismissed, according to a German court

That 'instant' resulted in a multimillion-euros transfer instead. In fact the pensioner received a huge €222,222,222.22 that day, according to the Telegraph.

The bank discovered the mistake shortly afterwards and corrected the error, but the clerk's boss was fired.

The case was taken to court by the 48-year-old female colleague - who was fired for the error last April.

At that time she said she had examined more than 800 documents, most were checked in less than two seconds.

The bank, which was not named in the ruling, published online, claimed the supervisor had tried to deceive her superiors by failing to properly check transfer payments.

The Hesse Labour court ruled, however, that the plaintiff should have received a warning and not a dismissal and said she should be reinstated in her job.

Although it was a 'terrible mistake' there was no evidence she had sought to cause deliberate harm to her employer, and she should be reinstated, the ruling said.
