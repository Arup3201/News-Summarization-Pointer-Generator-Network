Another body part has been found at a Melbourne river where two severed limbs and a bag of flesh have already been discovered.

A member of the public found the remains at the Maribyrnong River about 11am on Saturday.

Police won't confirm what the body part is, and it's not known whether it was found in the water or on the river bank.

It comes  after police released an image of a devil tattoo yesterday, hoping it will help identify the body of a man.

Police released the image after a forearm - severed at the elbow and wrist - was spotted floating in the Maribyrnong River in Melbourne by diners at a nearby restaurant on Thursday afternoon

The body part found on Saturday was in a plastic bag, police say.

Detectives believe the latest find is linked to the other male remains found so far.

A severed arm with a red devil tattoo was spotted near the Boathouse restaurant on Thursday, while the other remains were found further upstream.

The part found on Saturday was near Oakland Street, which is about 1km away from the restaurant.

Water police revisited the river on Saturday morning and remain at the scene.

Part of a limb and a black plastic bag of human flesh were found further upstream when police divers searched the area.

Detectives continued searching the river by boat on Friday morning and will focus on a bridge about two kilometres from the restaurant where the forearm was spotted

Detectives searching the river by boat on Friday morning focused on a bridge about two kilometres from the restaurant where the forearm was spotted. 

Missing person records are now being scoured by police as the body parts undergo forensic testing. 

Police say they hope a picture of the devil tattoo found on the inner forearm will help identify the man. 

'It was really deemed to be suspicious when a second body part was found,' homicide squad detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey told the ABC.

'I'm not sure exactly what part that is, we do know it's a limb but certainly seeing we've seen a second body part, we do believe it's suspicious.' 

It isn't clear how long the body parts had been in the river or where they were dumped.

'The examination that'll be conducted by the pathologists we are hopeful will assist in that regard,' Sgt Bailey said.

'We've looked through missing persons records and there's nothing obvious to us at this point in time.
