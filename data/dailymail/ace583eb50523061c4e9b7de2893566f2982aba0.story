A mugshot is perhaps the least likely beauty inspiration there is.

But a writer at XOVain has taken it upon herself to show readers how they can recreate the looks sported in Lindsay Lohan's six mugshots.

From the troubled starlet's first brush with the law in 2007, to her most recent mugshot last year, Annie Kreighbaum describes Miss Lohan's beauty evolution using herself as a model, demonstrating how she appears to have become ever-more prepared for the brutal flashbulb and harsh gray backdrop of a booking photo.

'You can clearly see a progression,' she writes. 'In her first, she’s a little bewildered, a little bleary-eyed. Totally understandable. . .

'By 
her sixth, almost six years later, she’s totally serving it! False 
eyelashes, perfectly contoured cheeks, smug brows like she’s been there 
before - because she had, like five times.'

Miss Kreighbaum calls Miss Lohan's first mugshot look, taken after she was arrested for DUI in July 2007, 'almost beach-y', with particular praise for the tousled hair and freckles.

She says 'abused eye make-up' is the way forward if one would also like to look 'upset and distraught', recommending a creamy pencil around the lash line. But to really elicit sympathy from one's booking officer, 'tweak out on an iced red eye.'

This would appear to mean applying powder kohl to your waterline on a moving train 'so you'll really start to tear up', then removing it with a baby wipe.

The next mugshot, from November 2007 
when Miss Lohan, now 26, served just 84 minutes in jail and began 
community service for her two DUI convictions, sees her with far more 
make-up. She has a heavy layer of fake tan, black kohl around the eyes 
and blonder hair.

The real Annie: 'I'm actually mega attractive when I'm not impersonating Lindsay Lohan's mugshots,' she says

Miss Kreighbaum
doesn't rate the look on herself though. After using an orange-tinted 
spray foundation, she writes: 'I think I look like Katie Price and 
Sylvester
Stallone's secret love child. . . You don't want a tutorial anyway. 
NEXT.'

Not much appears to have changed by the next mugshot though, in July 2010, when Miss Lohan served 13 days at California's Lynwood jail for violating her probation. Self-tan and eyeliner still seem to be integral to her look.

Her hair is sleeker and more groomed, however, and the eyeliner is less heavy. To achieve the look, Miss Kreighbaum turned to Urban Decay's 24/7 Glide On Pencil in the appropriately-named shade 'Delinquent'.

September 2010's booking photo was taken
after the actress failed a drug test and was ordered to return to jail 
for 30 days. She appealed and posted $300,000 bail before checking into 
rehab.

In this, we saw a completely different look altogether. Her hair, albeit greasy, was back to its natural red and her skin looked clear. Our writer suggests caramel-tinted brows and white eyeliner in the waterline to make you look awake.

She adds that while a matte light pink lip has 'never worked' for her, she recommends Sephora's Color Lip Last in 
Life in Pink to get Miss Lohan's look.

In October 2011 Miss Lohan was subject 
to yet another mugshot for failing to do her community service morgue 
duty hours. She was sentenced to 30 days in jail and 400 hours of 
community service, but spent just five hours behind bars due to overcrowding.

The actress at this point was back to platinum blonde, her lips look swollen and her skin looks pale. Regardless, Miss Kreighbaum
declares this look a winner because it looks 'somewhat ethereal' and in
her recreated version, she looks barely recognizable.

Back to red: In the most recent of Miss Lohan's mugshots, in March of this year (left), she looks her best to date, with healthy-looking skin and her natural hair color restored. Miss Kreighbaum says the look is 'so hot'

She achieves the pale skin using FACE Stockholm's Liquid Mineral Foundation 
in Synlig, with Too Faced's Chocolate Soleil
Matte Bronzing Powder for contouring. For the full lips, she uses Too 
Faced Lip Injection EXTREME gloss.

It is the most recent of Miss Lohan's mugshots, in March of this year, that appears to be her most successful to date though. The actress, who turned herself in to police for reckless driving and lying to police, looks her best to date, with healthy-looking skin and her natural hair color restored.

Miss Kreighbaum, who says the look is 'so hot', used  Sephora's cream blush in Coral Flush to recreate it, and mink false lashes.

'I sincerely hope that I’ll never have to recreate another 
Lohan mugshot because all this self-tanner and bronzer is WRECKING my 
complexion'

The writer acknowledges that though she addresses the subject of Miss Lohan's mugshots with humor, there is nothing amusing about being arrested.

'I don’t think it's funny when anybody’s going through a tough time. It sucks to be arrested!' she writes. 'I’m 
looking forward to [Lindsay] completing treatment and getting back on the 
grind.'

Nor, she insists, does she really look like Miss Lohan in real life and in fact 'I'm actually 
mega attractive when I'm not impersonating Lindsay Lohan's mugshots.'

She admits though, that Miss Lohan has the edge when it comes to mugshots, as she can neither pull off a full face of make-up so well, nor can her skin handle it.

'In reality, Lindsay is great at 
taking mugshots because she’s beautiful. . . [but] I sincerely hope that I’ll never have to recreate another 
Lohan mugshot because all this self-tanner and bronzer is WRECKING my 
complexion.'
