A young woman critically injured in Britain’s worst ever motorway pile-up – a crash that claimed the lives of her father and sister – has given birth to her first child.

For Emma Barton, 21, the arrival of son Gianni ten days ago is a Christmas miracle, as surgeons said her chances of becoming a mother after the horrific smash were ‘remote’. 

She was left in a coma following the crash on the M5 in Somerset on November 4, 2011. Seven people died and 100 others were hurt in the incident.

Emma Barton gave birth to Gianni ten days ago. The 21-year-old lost her father and sister in last year's crash

When Emma regained consciousness, her first question to medics was: Will I still be able to have a baby?

After being told her injuries – bruising on the brain, two collapsed lungs, five broken ribs, two fractures of  the pelvis and a crushed foot after being cut free from the wreckage – were so severe that the chances were remote, Emma was left heartbroken.

But, defying the odds, she gave birth to her healthy 8lb 11oz son on December 12 by caesarean section, and Gianni’s birth has been a blessing for a woman whose life seems to have been stalked by tragedy.

Her mother, Teresa, was diagnosed with a brain tumour when Emma was just a year-old, and died aged only 46 in 2005.

Ms Barton's car was trapped under a lorry in the pile-up which has been described as the worst in Britain's history

Then the motorway pile-up robbed her of her 67-year-old father Michael and her elder sister Maggie, 30.

‘Gianni means Christmas is back on the agenda,’ she says. ‘Having a baby is the start of a new family and new life for me.’

Emma and husband Chris Burbell, 25, hope the tragedies  of the past are now behind them.

Emma and her family were driving back to their home in Windsor from a funeral in Cornwall at the time of the accident. Earlier this month Geoffrey Counsell, who was  in charge of a fireworks display close to the motorway on the night of the crash, was cleared of breaching health  and safety laws.

‘When I saw Gianni I thought he looked just like my dad, which was a wonderful. We’ve given him the second name Michael in memory of him,’ says Emma.

‘The past years have been full of pain. Now Gianni has wiped away the sadness. Christmas is going to be good  – it is my turn to be happy.’
