The crack-smoking mayor of Toronto was supposed to enter rehab after announcing a leave of absence last Wednesday.

Ford reportedly got on a private plane bound for Chicago but he was turned away at the border, the Globe and Mail is reporting.

Neither Ford's brother Doug Ford or his lawyer Dennis Morris will say where the exactly the mayor is, but insist he is seeking treatment as promised.

Ford was last seen leaving his house the morning of May 1 to board a private plane at Buttonville Municipal Airport.

He landed in Chicago but never formally entered the country.

'He voluntarily withdrew his application to enter the USA,' Ray Norton, Canada's Consul General in Chicago, told the Globe and Mail. Norton added that Ford 'was not declined entry, per se'.

Norton didn't learn about the incident until after the fact, when he was notified by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.

CBP spokesman Kris Grogan wouldn't comment on Ford's application, because of the privacy act, but pointed out that foreigners attempting to enter the U.S. can be barred on the grounds of 'criminality, security reasons and documentations, among dozens of others'.

Ford's lawyer Dennis Morris wouldn't comment on where the plane went after the fact, since he wasn't on board.

He maintains that Ford is in rehab, but when asked where, Morris said: 'I think it is close to Timbuktu.'

'The bottom line is he’s in rehab, he’s getting rehab and he’ll be there for a number of weeks – and that’s the answer. It’s not like he’s at a baseball game in Los Angeles or something,' Morris said.

The mayor's brother Doug wouldn't even say which country he was in. He previously announced that Ford was seeking treatment at one of the best facilities in North America.

'The most important thing, everyone who is concerned if he's in rehab, the answer is yes. As for his whereabouts that's personal and that should stay with Rob,' Doug Ford said.

But that's not enough for politicians in Toronto, who are demanding answers for Ford's whereabouts.

'The mayor should explain where he's going to be and how long he anticipates being there,' Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti told the National Post. 'I think everybody will leave him alone if he does that.'

'Right now nobody in this city believes him and trusts him on any of this. If a plane landed and he didn't get off, he better tell this city where he is going for treatment.'

While the U.S. has barred foreigners from entering the U.S. before for noted drug use, such as when celebrity chef Nigella Lawson wasn't allowed to enter from the UK because she admitted to taking cocaine in a court case, Ford was allowed into the country as recently as March for an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

But that was before news broke of yet another tape in which the mayor appears to be smoking crack-cocaine.

The same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26.

Ford made headlines last year when another group in Toronto was trying to sell a different video of Ford smoking crack, and he refused to step down.

The new video also corresponded to reports that Ford got drunk at a Toronto bar Sullie Gorman's on April 28, making lewd comments about mayoral competition Karen Stintz.
