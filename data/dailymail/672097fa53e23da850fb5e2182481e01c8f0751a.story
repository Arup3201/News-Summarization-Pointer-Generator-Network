John Terry, the Chelsea captain that was banned and fined by the Football Association in 2012 for using racist language towards Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand, deemed the Paris Metro incident 'unacceptable' on Saturday.

Footage from Tuesday showed Souleymane S, a 33-year-old born in Paris, twice being shoved back on to the platform at Richelieu-Drouot station before a group of Chelsea fans chant: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it, we like it, we like it.'

Terry condemned the actions of those involved ahead of their Barclays Premier League match with Burnley in his match programme notes.

'This is our annual Game for Equality, when we show that this club stands against all forms of discrimination,' Terry said. 'Football is a sport for everyone, that is one of the main reasons why we love and what happened on the Paris Metro on Tuesday was unacceptable. The club has reacted quickly to deal with the situation and will continue to do so.' 

The club captain's comments came on the same day as Chelsea's second annual Game for Equality, in which they celebrate their diversity.

It sees Chelsea join forces with Kick It Out, Football vs Homophobia, Show Racism the Red Card, the Premier League and the FA to tackle discrimination. 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho added in his match programme notes: 'Today is our Game for Equality, when we celebrate this club's diversity and also the work we do to show that football is for everyone and that Chelsea is dedicated to tackling all forms of discrimination.'

Bruce Buck, Chelsea's chairman, met Kick It Out's Lord Ouseley previously to discuss how the club were tackling the Paris Metro incident, and he also took time to write in the match programme.

'I would like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of everyone at Chelsea Football Club, our disgust with regards to the incident that took place on the Paris Metro on Tuesday evening,' Buck said.

'We were all appalled by what we saw and the club would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Soulemane S for the behaviour of a group of individuals and their unforgivable actions towards him.

'We have been cooperating fully with the Metropolitan and Paris police forces in their ongoing investigation and will continue to do so. We have also been conducting our own investigation and all information from that is being shared with the police.

'The people involved in that incident in Paris do not represent Chelsea Football Club and they do not stand for the values of this club and they have no place at this club. This has been echoed loud and clear by the vast majority of Chelsea supporters and we would like to thank the many fans who have come forward with information on this case.

'Chelsea FC is proud of its diversity. I can assure you that Mr Abramovich was disgusted with Tuesday night's scenes in Paris and like all of us he absolutely does not tolerate any form of discrimination.'
