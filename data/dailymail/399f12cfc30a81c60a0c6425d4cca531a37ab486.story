It has been decades since a California socialite was buried in the front seat of her Ferrari in one of the country's most eccentric burials, but the grave remains a spectacle in Texas after nearly 40 years as thousands have visited the woman's grave.

The burial of oil heiress and Beverly Hills socialite Sandra Ilene West drew 300 onlookers to San Antonio's Alamo Masonic Cemetery in May 1977, according to an original report in a 1977 edition of The Register-Guard.

West was buried in the front seat of her light blue 1964 Ferrari 250GT - which would cost $2million if bought today - wearing a white nightgown 'with the seat slanted comfortably.'

Following the death of her Texas oil tycoon husband, Ike West, in 1968, West received his $5 million estate and promised it to her brother-in-law Sol West if he granted the burial request she had written in her will four years earlier, according toMy San Antonio.  

West died on March 10, 1977, according to an obituary. While some reports say West overdosed on prescription pills, others say she died due to complications of a car accident.

West and her Italian sports car were flown to San Antonio to be buried next to her late husband in the historic cemetery which boasts the graves of those who helped shape San Antonio, according to My San Antonio.

Death: West died on March 10, 1977. While some reports say West overdosed on prescription pills, others say she died due to complications of a car accident

The car carrying West's body was placed in a crate which was then lowered into the ground by a large crane. The grave was 19 feet long, 10 feet wide, and nine feet deep, the Houston Chronicle reports.

The large grave was then covered with cement to prevent vandalism and looting. 

Though few friends and no known members of West's family attended the 24-minute burial, according to the Guard, many went just to see the unusual burial for themselves.

'I just wanted to see how it was done,' one man told the United Press International, as reported by the Guard. 'If you can afford it, why not?' 

Husband: West and her Italian sports car were flown to San Antonio to be buried next to her late oil tycoon husband, Ike West Jr. 

West's coffin has since been covered by a grassy patch with only a tombstone commemorating the heiress and her extraordinary burial. 

However, thousands of tourists and history buffs have visited the historic cemetery since the burial took place to catch a glimpse of the cite that once gained national attention.

The historic cemetery is also a stop on many San Antonio tours and West's plot is featured as one of the cemetery's notable graves with a fascinating tale, My San Antonio reports. 

Other prominent graves in the historic cemetery include John Kampmann, a builder; John Lang Sinclair, composer of 'The Eyes of Texas'; and Clara Driscoll, who is credited by historians to have helped save the Alamo, according to a San Antonio tour website.
