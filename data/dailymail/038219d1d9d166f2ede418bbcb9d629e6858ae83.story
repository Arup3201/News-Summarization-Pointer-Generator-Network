When the BBC Breakfast show decided to do an item about being bitten by mosquitoes, the programme's producers took no chances.

A sealed box of mosquitoes was brought in with a small hole cut in the side, covered by some protective gauze netting, through which each presenter could put their arm to see who the insects preferred.

Unfortunately, as presenter Louise Minchin tried to put her arm through the netting into the box, she managed to rip it off entirely, leaving the way clear for the whole swarm of bugs to fly free into the studio.

Oops! As she pulled her arm away, the protective sleeve detached from the box, leaving the hole unguarded

The presenter was reduced to helpless laughter and had to mop her eyes after realising what she had done

The popular blonde host, 44, shrieked with laughter when she realised what she'd done, as the insects swarmed out of the box and up into the rafters.

Minchin had been interviewing Dr James Logan from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine about how the recent muggy weather had been perfect for mosquitoes.Â 

She and co-host Bill Turnbull, 57, had asked the doctor how best to avoid being bitten, and they'd discussed whether mosquitoes preferred some victims to others, putting their arms into the box of bugs.

But when Minchin pulled her arm away, she ripped the protective sleeve, leaving the doctor with an empty box where the insects had been.

Minchin gasped and said: 'Me and mosquitoes have a very bad relationship,' while Turnbull added: 'Anyone got any fly spray?'

The camera then cut to the newsdesk where newsreader Simon McCoy flapped his hands, mimicking swatting the pests away.
