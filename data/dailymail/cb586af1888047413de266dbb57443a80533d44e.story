Britain could be forced to hand an extra £2.5billion to Brussels to help plug a massive black hole in the EU budget, it emerged last night.

In a dramatic admission, EU Budget Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski said Brussels overspent its budget by an astonishing £20billion last year.

Mr Lewandowski, who blamed the situation on late invoices, said the cash would be taken from this year’s budget in the short term. But officials conceded it was almost certain to lead to a request for a bailout later this year, making a mockery of claims that the EU budget has been brought under control.

Britain faces paying another £2.4billion to plug the latest shortfall in the European Union's spending

A request on this scale would cost 
British taxpayers about £2.5billion this year – more than the entire 
annual budget of the Foreign Office.

The revelation prompted an angry response in Britain, where David Cameron claims he has curbed EU spending.

Tory
 MEP Marta Andreasen, a member of the European Parliament’s budget 
committee, said it was astonishing that the EU was asking for more money
 just three months after it was granted an emergency £10billion top-up 
to allow it to balance its books.

Miss Andreasen, a former chief 
accountant at the European Commission, condemned the EU’s ‘utter 
incompetence’ and ‘continued disdain with which it treats taxpayers’ 
money’.

She said European 
taxpayers ‘should not be throwing more money away on failing policy 
areas’, and added: ‘It seems  the European Commission is not only 
unwilling but is also completely unable to live within the means agreed.
 It repeatedly comes back, blaming others and looking for more cash.’

Brussels bureaucrats are fighting the introduction of a system to monitor how many hours they actually spend at their desks each week.

The claim a proposal forcing European Union officials to clock in and out of the office is ‘unsuitable’ in any ‘dynamic, modern organisation’.

Union officials claim that rather than ‘excessive’ checks, working time in the Brussels institutions should instead be based on ‘trust’.

Officials are unhappy that their working week has been increased from 37 hours to at least 40 hours in order to extract more value from their generous taxpayer-funded salaries.

Tory MEP Syed Kamall said: ‘I really don't think it is some sort of imposition to ask people to establish that they actually work the hours their contract says they do.

'It's what ordinary people do every working day in factories and offices across Europe."’

Bill
 Cash, Tory chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, 
described the situation as ‘completely unacceptable’, and said Britain 
should refuse any demand for more money.

He added: ‘They are stretching 
the patience of the British taxpayer beyond breaking point.

‘We cannot go on just paying up every time they come back with their begging bowl.’

Pawel
 Swidlicki, of the think-tank Open Europe, said it was time Brussels put
 its affairs in order rather than demanding even more cash from Britain.

He
 added: ‘This highlights the shocking lack of long-term planning or 
adequate controls in the EU budget. Any shortfall should be made up from
 future EU budgets rather than via a fresh top-up from member states.

‘The
 budget needs to be radically slimmed down and overhauled – ending the 
pointless recycling of regeneration funds among the EU’s richest members
 would be a good start.’

The UK Treasury is expected to oppose any extra cash for Brussels, as it did with last year’s demand for £10billion.

But
 the decision is made by qualified majority voting and Brussels sources 
say the UK is likely to be out-voted, as it was last year.
