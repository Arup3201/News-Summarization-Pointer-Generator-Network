Prime Minister Tony Abbott has gone on the offensive to win back voters by making a strongly-worded statement about Australia's fight against terrorism and visiting small businesses to market his proposed tax cut.

On Sunday Mr Abbott made it clear that Australia would no longer be taken ‘for mugs’ in the war against terrorism.

He may have been on the defensive over the past few weeks as his position as Prime Minister came under increased scrutiny, but he went on the attack on his official YouTube channel to reaffirm his government’s pledge to strengthen national security.

And on Monday during a visit to a sportswear factory in south Sydney Mr Abbott posed with a green and gold 'Abbott 1' shirt while flagging his new small business and jobs package.

'Small business is where our creativity most flourishes. Small business is where jobs creation gets going strongest and quickest,' he told reporters. 

In his national security address on Sunday, Mr Abbott was adamant that from now on there would no longer be any ‘benefit of the doubt’ given to those who were possible threats to the security of the nation.

‘It's clear to me that for too long we have given those who might be a threat to our country the benefit of the doubt,’ he said on the video.

‘There's been the benefit of the doubt at our borders, the benefit of the doubt for residency, the benefit of the doubt for citizenship and the benefit of the doubt at Centrelink.

‘And in the courts, there has been bail, when clearly there should have been jail.'

Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis was out on bail at the time of his attack at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place last December where he and two others died.

‘We are a free and fair nation. But that doesn't mean we should let bad people play us for mugs, and all too often they have. Well, that's going to stop,’ the Prime Minister said.

Mr Abbott made it clear that a review of the siege is being considered by the federal government, and that and the government's response would soon be released.

He also said that his government planned to pass data retention legislation as soon as possible to help counter terrorist activities.

‘We pledge to keep our country as safe and secure as we humanly can,’ Mr Abbott said.

‘As a nation we are responding to this threat. We’ve provided our security services with more powers, more resources and stronger laws.

‘I give you this assurance, as a country, we won’t let evil people exploit our freedom.’

Earlier this week Mr Abbott backed up his words with actions when on Tuesday police arrested two immigrants - Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25 - in Sydney for allegedly plotting an act of terror involving a machete attack in the name of Islamic State. 

Mr Abbott also condemned a 'brutal' shooting in Denmark as an affront to free speech. Twin attacks shook Copenhagen over the weekend. 

On Sunday Mr Abbott attended a community event in Castlereagh, western Sydney. He later condemned a 'brutal' shooting in Denmark as an affront to free speech

One man was killed when a cafe hosting an event where a cartoonist who had caricatured the Prophet Mohammed was speaking was sprayed with bullets, and another fatally shot in the head just hours later at the city's main synagogue. 

In a statement issued on Sunday, he said the thoughts of all Australians were with the Danish people.

'As with the Charlie Hebdo atrocity in Paris, the Copenhagen attack is an affront to one of our most fundamental values - freedom of speech,' Mr Abbott said.

'We stand with the people and government of Denmark in confronting this cynical attempt to undermine that fundamental right.' 

Mr Abbott reaffirmed his government’s pledge to strengthen national security across the board
