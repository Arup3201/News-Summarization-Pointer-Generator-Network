Audacious: Reece Scobie, pictured at an earlier hearing, duped travel companies and defrauded credit cards to pay for a globe-trotting travel spree

A teenager who enjoyed a jet-set 
lifestyle by conning his former bosses at a travel agent today admitted a
 further series of frauds with stolen credit cards.

Reece
 Scobie, who was 19 at the time of his original conviction, is currently
 serving a 16-month prison sentence in Scotland for swindling his way to
 a globetrotting lifestyle.

But
 today he admitted a further nine charges which included using stolen 
credit cards to book trains, flights and hotel accommodation online.

Scobie used the cards on popular websites like trainline.com and ebooker.com to pay for himself to travel the globe in luxury.

The
 teenager, who lived with his mother in Rait, Perthshire, at the time of
 the allegations, spoke only to confirm his name and to plead guilty 
when he appeared at Southwark Crown Court today.

Kieran
 Moroney, defending, said that Scobie is currently appealing his 
conviction for his previous fraud offences which netted him travel and 
accommodation worth more than £70,000.

‘Your honour is aware of the outstanding matters in Scotland,’ he said.

‘I
 would ask him to be granted bail in this matter so that he could be 
sent back to Scotland to serve the remainder of his sentence and for his
 appeal to be dealt with.’

Judge
 John Price told Scobie: ‘You are serving a sentence in Scotland, you 
are appealing against that sentence and we don’t know what is going to 
happen with that so I am going to grant you technical bail to get you 
back to Scotland and to help you get things sorted out as quickly as we 
can.

‘As soon as you are released in Scotland you must notify this court of your date of release’.

Travel's booking system to arrange business-class flights to a number of destinations, 
including Singapore (pictured), New York, Atlanta and Abu Dhabi

Dubai: Scobie used both his own name and a series of aliases to book the rooms at locations including Dubai

Scobie
 is currently in prison for conning his former travel agent bosses at 
Thomson Travel, a rival travel company and even Scottish court officials
 as he went on a travel spending spree worth tens of thousands of 
pounds.

During the six-month
 crime spree, the teenager, who has been diagnosed with Asperger’s 
syndrome, used a series of aliases to book business-class flights to 
destinations around the world, including Singapore and Los Angeles.

The
 lavish proceeds of his frauds inspired comparisons with Leonardo 
DiCaprio’s character in hit movie Catch Me If You Can, in the actor 
portrays Frank Abagnale jr, who posed as an airline pilot to travel the 
world.

Despite working at 
Thomson Travel for just two months, he continued to use the company’s 
passwords long after leaving his job, an earlier hearing was told.

He enjoyed round-the-world trips taking in such exotic destinations as Dubai, Auckland, New York and Vancouver.

And
 he even managed to dupe court staff into returning his passport which 
had been removed as a condition of bail by producing false documents 
that showed he worked for a new travel agency.

A
 court heard how Scobie used both his own name and a series of aliases 
to book the rooms. On one occasion, he treated two of his friends to a 
night in a luxury hotel.

On 
another occasion, he was in a British Airways airport lounge and spotted
 that the previous user of a computer there, who worked for Cambridge 
Business Travel, had not properly logged off.

Scobie
 was able to gain access to the company’s booking system and used it to 
arrange flights to LA, New York, Atlanta, Abu Dhabi and Singapore.

It
 was while Scobie was in Los Angeles that irregularities came to light 
and his return flight was cancelled, forcing him to borrow cash to pay 
for a flight home.

Scobie admitted two charges of fraud by obtaining services, flights and accommodation while employed at Thomson Travel in Perth.

He
 also admitted that between July 2011 and January 2012 he booked an 
unspecified number of flights and hotel rooms on the company’s account 
using company passwords.

He also admitted accessing the accounts of Cambridge Business Travel and booking numerous flights in January last year.

The court was told that Thomson Travel had been conned out of £11,256, while Cambridge Travel was duped out of £59,878.

Scobie was finally arrested early in 2013 and had his passport taken by Perth Sheriff Court as a bail condition.

However, he returned to court on April 18 and falsely said he had a new job in the travel industry and would need his passport.

The passport was returned after he produced a series of faked documents relating to his ‘new’ post.

Today
 Scobie admitted new three charges of fraud, two of possessing articles 
for use in fraud and four of unlawful interception of emails from 
laterooms.com to the Lerryn Hotel and the Denehurst Hotel.

No date has yet been set for his sentence in the English court.
