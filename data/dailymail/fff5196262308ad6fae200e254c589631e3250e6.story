All eyes will be on Little Mix, Marcus Collins and Amelia Lily next Saturday night to see which finalist will win X Factor and go on to have the Christmas No1.

However, if choirmaster Gareth Malone has it his way, a different song may be topping the charts.

The Bafta-winning star is hoping his group Military Wives will triumph over the festive period, with the 100 vocalists currently smashing pre-order records.

Coming together: Military Wives look set to rival The X Factor Christmas No1

Wherever You Are - a tribute to soldiers with lyrics taken from 
love letters written by the women to their partners in Afghanistan - has stormed Amazon’s bestseller chart, two weeks before its release.

The overwhelming response has led bookmakers to 
slash the odds on it beating the X Factor winner.

Paddy Power have slashed the odds to just 5/6 and the unknown X Factor singer is the second favourite in the betting at 11/10.

Chris Evans is supporting the single, saying: 'With a fair wind it’ll be a Christmas 
No1, one that actually means something.'

The radio presenter is even urging Simon Cowell to do his bit for charity and let the wives perform on the X Factor final this weekend and the odds of them doing so are currently 3/1.

The 100 singers, from military bases in Devon, touched the nation’s hearts on BBC2 show The Choir.

Malone, 36, has even been plugging the song across the Atlantic, writing on Twitter: 'Hello America. UK Military Wives are singing to raise money for military charities (whilst taking on XFactor!)...'

The Royal Academy Of Music graduate first appeared on reality series The Choir in 2007, with the series teaching choral singing to people who had no experience or were reluctant to learn.

How tweed! Gareth Malone will bring some fierce competition to the charts against the winning X Factor star

Last month, The Choir Military Wives was
broadcast with Malone visiting Chivenor Barracks in Devon to meet women
at a 'family day' before the troops were deployed to Afghanistan.

He later recruited more wives from Plymouth and 42 Commando Royal Marines, before the final group performed at The Royal British Legions Remembrance parade at the Royal Albert Hall.

Gareth asked the ladies to donate parts of letters to their loved ones to become a song, with Paul Mealor (who also wrote for Prince William and Kate's wedding) to come up with an appropriate track.

Profits from the single will go to the Royal British Legion and Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Forces Help.
