A Family Feud contestant managed to shock both their opponent and host Steve Harvey on a recent episode when they have what might be the most awkward answer ever to a survey question.

Steve Harvey asked contestants Darci and Manny; 'What does a doctor pull out of a person?'

Darci buzzed in almost immediately, and then shouted out; 'A gerbil.'

Darci said that a 'gerbil' (above) is something a doctor might pull out of a person

Darci cringed (above) immediately after she answered the question

Harvey stood stunned and in silence for almost a full minute, while Manny could not control his laughter.

'I didn't say that,' said Darci, as she both laughed and cringed.

Making matters worse, a gerbil was not one of the popular responses to the survey question.

Manny however fared slightly better with his guess - a baby. 

As for that gerbil response, it would seem Darci may have heard that Richard Gere rumor from years ago.
