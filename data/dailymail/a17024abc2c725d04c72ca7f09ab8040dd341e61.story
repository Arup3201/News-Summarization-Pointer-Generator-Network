Two drug gangs who attempted to launch a 'vast' cocaine smuggling operation by targeting a dock worker have been jailed for a total of nearly 150 years.

Ten men - nine gangsters and the worker at Portsmouth Docks, Shaun Wilson - will serve between eight-and-a-half and 20 years each for conspiring to smuggle in millions of pounds of the Class A drug in exotic fruit containers.

Investigators at the National Crime Agency (NCA) said two organised crime groups targeted Wilson, 46, so they could exploit his knowledge of security procedures.

The gangs met him separately on several occasions in service stations, pubs and parks to plan cocaine imports.

Each shipment was to be timed to coincide with Wilson's shifts so he could remove the drugs from the docks without detection.

However, NCA officers were watching the meetings and swooped when the first shipment - 26kg (57lb) of the drug hidden in a container of pineapples on a boat from Costa Rica - was on its way to the UK in November 2010.

The drugs would have had street value of around £3million.

All of the first gang members were arrested and the apprehension of Wilson stopped the second group from succeeding with their plan to bring in another huge haul in a container of bananas.

The full extent of the plots was disclosed today when reporting restrictions were lifted after Audley Powell, 56, became the tenth defendant to be sentenced. He was jailed at Winchester Crown Court for eight-and-a-half years.  

Wilson was found guilty in September 2011 of the first conspiracy to import cocaine and was jailed for 14 years.

He admitted involvement in the second plot and received a concurrent eight-year sentence.

Gerry McGowan, of the NCA, said:'Wilson abused his position of trust by providing the crime groups with details of suitable ships, routes and times. He was going to ensure he was on duty to guarantee safe removal of the drugs.

'The long term plan was to import vast quantities of cocaine on a regular basis.

'Protecting our borders is a priority for the NCA. We will be relentless in pursuing criminals who try to bring drugs into the country, however long it takes, and wherever they try to hide.'

Powell, of Catford, south London, was part of the second group. He was on the run until November last year, when investigators traced him to Jamaica and brought him back to the UK. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine in January this year. 

Two of the gang members involved in the 26kg plot absconded during their trial and fled to Malta, but were convicted in their absence and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

The men, Roy Godber, 64, from Rainham in Essex, and David Roberts, 61, from Romford, Essex were tracked down and extradited to the UK in 2013.

Others sentenced were Jason Flisher, 43, from Folkestone, Kent (16 years), Richard Edwards, 51, from Barking, east London (20 years) and Eric Ward, 51, from Portsmouth (10 years).

Those involved in the second gang who were sentenced were Errol Heibner, 69, from Bow, East London and Norman Burton, 57, from Catford, south London, who were both jailed for 14 years.

Donald Chambers, from Charlton, was jailed for 13 years.

The total of all the men's sentences was 149-and-a-half years.

A further two men were convicted of money laundering offences after being arrested at the Channel Tunnel as part of the wider operation. They were handed suspended sentences.
