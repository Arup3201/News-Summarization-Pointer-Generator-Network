Need that little bit of extra motivation to hit the gym? A new piece of research may get you running to your next yoga class.

According to a new study, more and more women are experiencing exercise-induced orgasms.

An ‘exercise induced orgasm’ (EIO) or ‘coregasm’, as it is known by the leagues of gym-addicted fans on the internet, has gained both recognition amongst the fitness world and scientific backing.

Rise of the coregasm: Research has revealed that more and more women are experiencing exercise-induced orgasms, and yoga, favoured by Miranda Kerr, is one of the top sports for causing one

Get The Gloss writer Ahmed Zambarakji investigated the growing trend and discovered the most orgasm-inducing exercises.

He writes: 'A recent study conducted by the 
University of Indiana published in the journal Sexual and Relationship 
Therapy suggests that the most orgasm-inducing exercises are 'climbing 
poles or ropes, biking/spinning and weight lifting. Anything that involves engaging your 
abs, basically.'

And the most effective 
workout? An exercise that works the abdominal muscles using a piece of 
gym equipment called the 'captain's chair.'

To perform the exercise you stand with your forearms resting on the padded armrests of the chair, which are positioned at right angles to the body.

Fitness fanatic: Of the women who came clean in the study, 45 per cent held abdominal exercises responsible, 26.5 per cent weight lifting, 20 per cent yoga, 15.8 per cent cycling and 13.2 per cent running. Fitness fan Millie Mackintosh better watch out!

You then squeeze your abdominal muscles 
(which support the trunk of the body) to help you lift your knees to 
your chest before lowering the feet to the floor again.

Of the women who came clean in the study, 45 per cent held abdominal exercises responsible, 26.5 per cent weight lifting, 20 per cent yoga, 15.8 per cent cycling and 13.2 per cent running.

A lucky - and, one assumes, shockingly sensitive - 9.6 -per cent could even experience an orgasm by going for a brisk walk.

And it seems that the trend is growing; 40 per cent of respondents had experienced an EIO on more than 10 occasions.

But the majority of women aren't enjoying these experiences in the gym perhaps as much as they may in the bedroom. A fifth of women who experienced them 
said they had no control over the experience and most of them felt 
self-conscious as a result.

Debby Herbenick, co-author of the study, said: 'These data are interesting because they suggest that orgasm is not necessarily a sexual event, and they may also teach us more about the bodily processes underlying women's experiences of orgasm.'

While Hebernick claims the mechanics of the coregasm are still to be confirmed, an earlier study - and a bit of common sense - offers a relatively simply explanation, writes Ahmed.

'Exercise revs up the sympathetic nervous system and, for women who are already quite sensitive, an increased heart rate, constricted blood vessels, and elevated blood pressure might just be enough to tip them over the edge.

'A study entitled Sympathetic Nervous System Activity and Female Sexual Arousal (the clue is in the title) was the first to suggest that the female orgasm could be a “purely physiologic” phenomenon.

'This fits nicely with Hebernick’s statement that  “Most women reporting EIO said they were not fantasising sexually or thinking about anyone they were attracted to during their experiences”.'
