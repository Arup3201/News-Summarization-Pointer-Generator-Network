Nearly 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians applied to work in Britain in the first three months of this year, dramatic new official figures showed yesterday.

A total of 34,904 Romanians and 10,445 Bulgarians registered for National Insurance numbers in January, February and March – the first three months after the lifting of employment restrictions on migrant workers from the two countries.

The new statistics severely undermine claims made last week that the number of Romanians and Bulgarian workers in the country actually fell in the first months of this year.

Nearly 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians applied to work in Britain in the first three months of this year. Among the first to arrive earlier this year was Romanian Victor Spirescu. Landing at Luton Airport on New Year's Day, he was greeted by Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee

In the run-up to the European elections, the BBC claimed there were 4,000 fewer Romanian and Bulgarian workers in Britain in March than in January, and its political editor scoffed: ‘So much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants coming from Romania and Bulgaria once the door to the UK was opened.’

However the evidence used by the BBC and others was drawn from Office for National Statistics (ONS) surveys widely regarded as being flawed.

The National Insurance number record – which provides an accurate count of exactly who has applied to work in this country – told an entirely different story when published yesterday, the day of the elections.

In the year to March, 46,890 Romanians applied for the National Insurance qualification, up by 163 per cent on the 17,820 who applied in the previous 12 months.

Bulgarian applications went up by 71 per cent over the 12 months to 17,750. National Insurance registrations by Romanians in the first three months of this year are nearly double those for the whole of 2013.

The ONS said 30 per cent of those registering in 2014 had been in Britain for more than a year and 22 per cent had registered within three months of arriving in Britain.

‘This indicates that the January to 
March registration figures are actually reflecting migration over an 
extended period,’ it said.

However it may also indicate that 
Romanians and Bulgarians who had been working illegally in Britain 
seized the chance to become lawfully employed in January.

The 
MigrationWatch think-tank, which projected that 50,000 Romanians and 
Bulgarians would arrive each year now that their citizens were free to 
work in this country, said the National Insurance figures backed up its 
analysis.

The
 ONS figures claimed that a total of 140,000 people born in Romania and 
Bulgaria were employed in Britain in the first three months of the year 
and Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said its 
findings ‘give the lie to Ukip’s scaremongering on immigration’.

However, the National Insurance figures show that between the spring of 2002 and the spring of 2014, there were nearly 300,000 numbers issued to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria.

Overall, the immigration statistics yesterday said that net immigration – the number by which immigration swelled the population after emigration has been taken into account – was 212,000 last year. This is double the 1990s levels that David Cameron is pledged to reach by the time of the election next year.

Among the first to arrive when controls on migrants from the two impoverished countries lapsed  earlier this year was Romanian  Victor Spirescu. Landing at Luton Airport on New Year’s Day, he was greeted by Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs committee.

Mr Spirescu, 30, told reporters: ‘I don’t come to rob your country. I come to work and then go home.’

Days after arriving, he found work with a team of fellow Eastern Europeans washing cars at a supermarket in the Bedfordshire town of Biggleswade – but he  lasted only one day before disappearing.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘While recent net migration levels remain stable, the figures show that it has fallen by a third since its peak in 2005 under the last government and that this Government’s reforms have cut net migration from outside the EU to levels not seen since the late 1990s.

‘We are focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement between EU member states and addressing the factors that drive European immigration to Britain.’

But Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘David Cameron has broken his solemn promise to the British people on one of the most important political issues. And he has done so because he refuses to take back control of our borders in respect of more than 400 million people from more than two dozen countries on continental Europe.’

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘David Cameron and Theresa May promised “no ifs, no buts” to get their net migration target down to the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament, and the actual figure is over twice that.’
