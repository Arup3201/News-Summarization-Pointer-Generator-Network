Afghanistan has suffered more than most as a country after decades of war and civil unrest.

With the country now appearing on a more stable footing politically, the same cannot be said of its once flourishing silk trade which it was so proud of.

Cheaper, foreign imports are threatening generations of silkmaking families, as well as there being a decreasing lack of support for silkworm farmers.

Dying trade? An Afghan handles cocoons at a silk factory in Herat competition from cheaper synthetic silk from China and Pakistan has put the industry at great risk

Proud: An Afghan man shows raw silk ready to be woven into fabric - but the question is can it flourish in a day and age of cheaper imports?

Tradition: Skills which have been passed down through the generations of families in Herat are at serious risk of being lost in time

'In the past, our handicrafts were very valuable, and businesspeople and wealth customers used to go to those who were producing silk handkerchiefs, shawls and turbans,' said Mohammad Hussain, speaking to The Institute of War And Peace Reporting, 75, his body bent after more than half a century as a silk weaver.

'Owning silk products was then a sign of nobility, but now the good customers are gone, along with our high wages.'

Cheaper, synthetic silk is being bought as an alternative, but as with any material which is cheaper to produce and buy, the quality is also lessened.

Career path: This young boy may have to re-evaluate whether it is a safe option to work in the silk industry

Sad: In Herat, once an important stop on the famous Silk Route, a few famlies are struggling to keep a once-splendid silk industry alive

Show of support: An Afghan woman buys raw silk to be woven into fabric in a market place in Herat - supporting the local industry

A pure, silk scarf might cost around 400 Afghanis (£5), whereas a synthetic version which could be imported from nearby Pakistan or China would only cost 150 Afghanis (£2).

The major products of Herat silk weaving industries include shawls, scarves, turbans and other silken fabrics.

Speaking to the Pahjwok Afghan news, Ghulam Sakhi, 75, who learned the trade from his father when he was 10 said: 'Thirty years ago there were 1,000 silk weaving looms in Herat city, all of which were using pure silk, but now most of the weavers use synthetic silk.

'I learned weaving from my father when I was 10 and for the past 65 years I have never used synthetic silk.'

He has been weaving ever since and only with natural fibres.

The price of natural threads has 
doubled, and a once thriving stop on the 'Silk Road' now faces its 
biggest challenge yet, not only to keep family tradition going, but to 
also make a profitable business out of it.

One kilogram of pure silk costs more 
than 3,000 Afghanis while synthetic Pakistani silk can be bought for 420
Afghanis per kilogram.

However,
if the Afghan government stepped in and offered a fairer deal to 
support the silkworm farmers and weavers, the industry could compete 
with its synthetic opposite.

'Silk
weaving is a halal craft and it reveals the native art of Herat 
province', said Abas Azami, head of silkworm producers and silk weavers,
to the Pahjwok.

'The government should not let this art vanish,' Azami said.

A long stretch: A map showing the traditional 'Silk Road' or 'Silk Route;' however with the growth of free trade, a country's individual industry is threatened

Worrying: The Herat region of northern Afghanistan has historically been the centre of silk production, textiles, and a burgeoning garment industry

Herat, to the west of Kabul, was once an important stop on the Silk Road - but now their once-proud industry faces a serious threat

Cheaper, imported, synthetic fibre could see Afghan silkmakers as well as silkworm farmers out of business

A synthetic scarf will cost half as much as a genuine silk product
