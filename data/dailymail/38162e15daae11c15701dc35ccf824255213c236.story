When Gordon told me he saw Ed Miliband as a potential Labour leader, I was incredulous.

It was the party conference of 2007, and Gordon — now in No 10 — wanted something to distract the media from speculation about a possible snap election.

‘Build up the young guys,’ he said. ‘Turn it into a beauty contest about who’ll take over from me.’

I asked him who he wanted me to mention to the media as potential contenders.

Game of thrones: Gordon Brown keeps Ed Balls close at the 2009 Labour Party Conference but secretly favoured Ed Miliband

He reeled off surnames like a football manager naming his line-up: ‘Purnell. Miliband. Kelly. Burnham. Cooper. Balls. Miliband.’

I replied: ‘You’ve already said Miliband.’ ‘Both of them,’ he said.

‘Really?’ I said, surprised. ‘You want me to say Ed Miliband?’ Gordon was adamant: ‘You need to watch Ed Miliband, he’s the one to watch.’ 

I could understand Ed Balls being on the list, because the only thing he lacked was confidence in public speaking which — while it was clearly a very big deal — was something he could improve.

But for all his academic and emotional intelligence, his confidence and good humour, I’d never seen Ed Miliband as a potential leader until then.

First, because I’d never seen the drive and ambition it’s now clear he possessed, and second because he’d have to get past his brother, the guy who used to send him curt emails from No 10 saying: ‘Get this sorted.’

But when I thought about it — more than once when deliberations were going on about a snap election in 2007, and what that would mean for the timing of the next one — I’d heard Ed Miliband say: ‘I’d fancy a post-Olympics election in 2012.’

Whether that was ‘I’ speaking for the Labour Party, or for himself, or indeed for both, was never quite clear.

So it wasn’t too incongruous to hear Gordon talking up Ed Miliband’s chances. Then he added: ‘You know you’ll have to choose between them one day. Who will you back?’

‘I’m closer to Ed Miliband,’ I said, which was undoubtedly true at the time — I didn’t send Ed Balls text messages about football or gossip to him about which Treasury civil servants might have the hots for each other.

‘Don’t base it on who you’re close to,’ Gordon said. ‘Base it on who you believe in.’

Looking back, I think it was a mistake for Gordon to say to people that we’d one day have to choose between the Eds. 

People like me who’d always seen them as indivisible began seeing them as separate entities, and — over time — camps grew up, with the inevitable rivalry, distrust and sniping that followed.

The team around Gordon, which had always been remarkable for its unity, suddenly developed fissures. 

The
 fact that Ed Miliband zealots later used my sacking as an opportunity 
to give anonymous and aggressive briefings against Ed Balls — despite 
the damage that would do to Gordon as well – was a sign of how bad 
things got.

It would not 
have been unreasonable for Gordon to say — much as the Milibands’ mother
 did during their contest — that he would never take sides between the 
two Eds, or expect his advisers to do so.

So why didn’t he? Because deep down, he knew one day he’d probably have to choose himself.

If
 David Miliband emerged as a leadership front-runner, determined, as 
Gordon would see it, to take the party down routes he had resisted for 
more than a decade — creeping privatisation of public services, closer 
integration with Europe — he would have to try to stop him.

That
 would mean backing the candidate that he felt was best able to set out 
an alternative, Brownite vision — and ultimately the candidate most 
likely to win.

When that contest materialised almost as exactly as feared in 2010, Gordon, however uncomfortable it felt, was forced to pick a favoured candidate between the Eds, and use whatever influence he had to try to secure them votes.

By that stage, I was long gone from Downing Street, but people try everything and everyone when the leadership is on the line.

That September, rumours began to circulate that Ed Balls might cut a late deal with David Miliband, where David would accept Ed’s position on the pace of deficit reduction and proclaim his attributes as a potential shadow Chancellor, in return for which Ed would withdraw from the race and urge his supporters to switch allegiance to David.

My mobile, usually silent those days, started to ring again: Gordon and others close to him urged me that — if I had any influence over Ed Balls or his team — I should tell him he had to reject any deal offered by David, and instead pursue the same deal with Ed Miliband.

It would be ‘madness’, they said, if he backed David to be leader, not Ed. I said I wasn’t in a position to help even if I wanted to.

As it was, Balls made clear he wasn’t interested in any deals, and neither Miliband brother was inclined to offer one.

So it came to nothing, but did very clearly expose where Gordon had his colours nailed.

And just as Ed Miliband can very cogently justify why he felt compelled to challenge his brother, I’m sure Gordon could equally well explain why he felt obliged privately to back Ed Miliband over Ed Balls, while remaining publicly neutral.

Both saw their decisions as means to the most important end — victory in the battle for the soul of the Labour Party.

That was all that mattered, even if it meant Ed Balls limping away from the field feeling just as bruised as David Miliband.

If Labour is in power after the 2015 election, either in its own right or in coalition, with Ed Miliband installed as Prime Minister and Ed Balls as Chancellor, I’m sure they’ll invite Gordon to the first Downing Street Christmas party, and get him to tell his ‘Japanese Admiral’ joke for old time’s sake.

Perhaps the three will reflect on how far they’ve come since they first started working together in Gordon’s opposition office 21 years before.

And perhaps they can all shake hands then, and let all the fissures of the past be healed, and every bygone be bygone.

The key to Ed Miliband’s personality is his father. Indeed, few fathers have influenced their politician sons as much as Ralph Miliband, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Belgium who rose to become one of the top academic analysts on modern socialism. 

The policies of New Labour would probably have appalled Ralph, who died in 1994, and his younger son would doubtless have sympathised — though he was in no position to change things. Now, of course, he is.

It’s hard to listen to any of Ed Miliband’s occasionally tortured, over-academic speeches without hearing his father’s voice, especially when he talks about recasting the capitalist model and re-shaping society through the empowerment of ordinary people.

And that’s not just about Ed’s politics; it’s also undoubtedly central to how he explains to himself and to the rest of his family why he challenged his older brother for the Labour leadership.

Inspiration: Ed Miliband with his father Ralph in 1989 at home

What better reason than needing to achieve his father’s vision and ensure David Miliband did not traduce it? An act of supposed disloyalty to his brother becomes transformed in his mind into the ultimate act of tribute to his father.

At the Treasury, the two Eds were a double act. The idea Miliband was ever made to feel subordinateto Balls is baloney, along with the myth of him bringing Balls his morning coffee.

However, Ed Miliband often found himself acting as confidant for some of the more sensitive Treasury ministers and advisers who occasionally felt ignored or dismissed by Balls, and it was natural for Miliband to sympathise and say he knew what they were going through; it was the same for him.

Whether that was just good management, or artful bolstering of his clique, it worked. When the two stood against each other for the Labour leadership, it was interesting to watch how many of those who had cried on Ed Miliband’s shoulder joined his camp, while the more robust types were firmly with Balls.

But if Ed Miliband did snipe about Ed Balls behind closed doors, it was never reciprocated.

The first time I ever heard Balls say anything remotely negative about Miliband was at the end of 2008, when the latter effectively threatened to resign from the Cabinet if a decision was made to build a third runway at Heathrow.

Balls was genuinely outraged that Miliband could ignore the need to expand airport capacity just for the sake of his reputation with the green lobby and his own political positioning.

He was also angry that Gordon had been made to look weak in front of his Cabinet at a time when he was already so vulnerable, by having to kowtow to a supposed ally.

A clear subtext to Ed Balls’s irritation that day was seeing his former junior partner so brazenly betraying his political ambitions. Doubtless David Miliband felt the same way.

You could see that same irritation again and again during the leadership hustings in 2010, Balls and David regularly exchanging looks of incredulity when they’d hear Ed Miliband distance himself from New Labour.
