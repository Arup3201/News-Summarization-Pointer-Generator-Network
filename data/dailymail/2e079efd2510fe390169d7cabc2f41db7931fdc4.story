Some of Bristolâ€™s most familiar landmarks have been recreated using just balls of wool and knitting needles.

More than 100 volunteers got together at the Paper Village arts and craft shop in Bedminster to knit well-known city sights.

The project, dubbed Briswool, has been overseen by Vicki Harrison, and has taken more than a year to complete.

And now they have a woollen replica of their city to show for all of their hard work.

Some of the sights that have been immortalised in wool include the famous Clifton Suspension Bridge, the SS Great Britain and the Hippodrome.

The harbour and city centre have also been knitted along with the Bristol crocodile, which was reported to be on the loose in the city earlier this year after several reported sightings.

In order to depict a busy centre, the knitters also created cars to give the impression of a traffic jam
