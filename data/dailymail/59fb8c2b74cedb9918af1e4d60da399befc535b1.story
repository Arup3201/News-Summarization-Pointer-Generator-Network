A mother whose baby had a heart attack after being given contaminated feed in hospital has spoken of her anguish at being suspected of poisoning him.

Frances Blacklock, 27, was caught up in a police investigation before her son was a week old after he went into cardiac arrest while on a drip feed and in an incubator at University College Hospital in London (UCLH).

He had been delivered by Caesarean section on February 7 2012, and was taken to another hospital to have surgery to correct a bowel problem diagnosed while he was in the womb.

But soon after he was brought back to UCLH, he suffered the heart attack, which investigators later found was due to excessive magnesium in his IV feed.

After the incident, hospital staff phoned Ms Blacklock, who rushed in only to discover her son in a weak and dire state - which nobody could explain.

She said: 'I was told to come to 
the hospital as soon as possible, as Mason was back on an incubator. 
When I got there, he was also on a ventilator and looked grey. It was 
horrific but no one could tell what had happened.'

The new mother was then told that police would investigate the incident amid fears her son was poisoned.

Mason survived and is now two years old - but it took a year-long probe by police and medical investigators to conclude that the feed had been to blame.

Ms Blacklock said: 'The investigation was awful, even my partner and I had to be 
eliminated from suspicion. To be involved in something like that was 
just heartbreaking, especially when all we cared about was Mason getting
 better.

'Mason
 is now two and a half and, while he needs regular appointments at UCLH 
to check his progress, he is on his way to what we hope will be a full 
recovery.'

In danger: Mason suffered a heart attack just days after having emergency surgery

Ms Blacklock - who says her partner was also under suspicion - is now taking legal action against the Quest Healthcare - the company which produced the feed.

She has also called for safety regulations to be overhauled.

She said: 'We want to know how these problems happened and what is being done to 
prevent them from happening again.

'The recent problems outlined by 
Public Health England brought all of the bad memories back from our 
experiences. No one else should have to face what we have been through 
and lessons must be learned.'

David Body, a lawyer at solicitors Irwin Mitchell, who represent Ms Blacklock and her son, said: 'The recent reports linking feed contamination to the death of a child have shone a spotlight on this issue and the products that vulnerable patients are administered during hospital treatment.

'Our work on behalf of Mrs Blacklock means we understand the ordeal undergone by parents when an event like this happens and the uncertainty about the long-term consequences this can have on affected children.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that the 2012 investigation took place, which concluded that no crimes had taken place.

A UCLH spokesman said: 'Mason came to us as a very sick baby and when he was six days old his condition deteriorated rapidly.

'Due to the astute intervention of our clinical team, this was discovered to be due to high levels of magnesium in Mason’s blood.

'We are pleased that our swift intervention saved his life. We are in regular contact with Mason’s family - who have nothing but praise for our care - and are delighted that he has grown into a healthy two-year-old boy'.

A legal representative for Quest Healthcare said: 'There was no issue raised at the 
time of any liability on the part of Quest Healthcare for any medical 
issues concerning Mason Blacklock; nor was any such issue raised at the 
time by the Blacklock family or their solicitors who expressed 
satisfaction with the outcomes.

'Fifty five bags of the same batch of the
 food was supplied by Quest Healthcare and no problems of any kind were 
reported, and no subsequent issues have been raised about any of their 
products.’
