Animal cruelty: Khalid Undre's restaurant boasted green credentials, but he was convicted of failures in rearing cows on his own smallholidng

The owner of an upmarket vegetarian restaurant has been accused of 'appalling animal cruelty' after he some of his cows died by the leader of Harrow Council.

Khalid Undre failed to give enough food and water to a 20-strong herd of Red Poll cattle on his smallholding in the middle of winter.

RSPCA inspectors were tipped off and found one cow dead in heavy snow alongside its calf.

Another died after giving birth, though its calf survived and now lives on a petting farm in Sussex.

The other cattle were underweight and dehydrated after being left exposed in sub-zero conditions without enough food or water.

The shocking case came despite Undre's restaurant Down to Earth, in west London's Kensington High Street, boasting of its 'environmentally sound, sustainable and animal friendly' credentials.

Located in one of London's wealthiest areas and including a cafe and shop, it sold dishes like organic scrambled eggs with herb-sauteed mushrooms for £7.50 and a 'raw food' vegan terrine for £8.50.

Other animal-friendly dishes included a Shepherd's pie made from lentils and a burger made from mixed nuts and vegetables.

The restaurant's website even claimed that 'by-products from our kitchen go to feed the cows in our Harrow farm.'

It added: 'Our organic food is produced using the purest methods; no synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, radiation, industrial solvents or chemical food additives allowed.

'By its nature environmentally sound, sustainable and animal friendly, we work hard to ensure that the organic produce we offer always meets the highest of standards: Our own.'

Willesden Magistrates' Court heard RSPCA officers visited the smallholding in Harrow, north London, last January after a tip-off from a worried member of the public.

He denied five charges of animal mistreatment but was found guilty after a trial.

After the investigation the dehydrated herd was then sold to another farmer.

Some calves which had been born at the site were left untagged contrary to the law, and were slaughtered at Undre’s request, the court heard.

The surviving cows were found dehydrated and underweight, the court heard. Undre denied five charges of animal cruelty but was found guilty, handed 120 hours' community service and made to pay £2,500

Undre, 50, from Kenton, north London, was sentenced to 120 hours of community work and ordered to pay £2,500 towards prosecution costs.

He was found guilty on five counts: failing to feed his cows a wholesome diet, failing to feed them at regular intervals, failing to provide adequate access to drinking water, failing to tag four calves and failing to dispose of a carcass.

Harrow Council leader Susan Hall said: 'This was an appalling offence of animal cruelty, made all the more grotesque by the cynical way in which this man paraded himself as a champion of ethical food standards.

'Our officers work extremely hard to prosecute these complex cases, and it is down to their hard work that these animals’ suffering is over, and their owner brought to justice.'

MailOnline was unable to reach Undre immediately. However, he told the Evening Standard he intended to appeal against his conviction.
