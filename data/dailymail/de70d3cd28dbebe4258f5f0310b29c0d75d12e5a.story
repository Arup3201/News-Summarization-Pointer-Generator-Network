Meet the world's smallest lamb - weighing in at just 2.2lb and only just as tall as a pint glass.

Tiny Bobby, the runt of triplets, is 10in long and stands just 9in tall - so the other lambs in his flock dwarf him.

He is so small he needs round-the-clock care to build up his strength - and sleeps cuddled up to a labrador in the home of Rebekah Kennedy, 26, manager of Fishers Farm Park, in Wisborough Green, West Sussex, where he was born.

Tiny: Bobby, the runt of triplets, is 10in long and stands 9in tall - so the other lambs in his flock dwarf him

Smallest: He is thought to be the world's smallest lamb - weighing in at just 2.2 pounds and only as high as a pint glass (seen here with one of his normal-sized peers)

Care: Bobby is miniscule he needs round-the-clock care to build up his strength - and sleeps cuddled up to a labrador

Bobby's vital statistics have been sent 
to the Guinness World Records and staff are confident he will soon be 
recognised as the world's smallest lamb.

Ms Kennedy said: 'I've worked here for seven years and I've never seen a lamb so small. I took Bobby home with me to help him get a bit stronger and he's improving. On the day he was born he barely bleated but now he's calling and calling to me around the house.'

Ms Kennedy said Bobby is 'a bit wobbly on his feet'Â  but that he can walk to her across a room now.

'He's a bit like a tortoise, keeping it slow and steady,' she said. 'I've hand-reared a few lambs but none as tiny as Bobby. It's a bit like looking after a premature baby at the moment and I've been giving him antibiotics to clear his lungs up.'

Fighter: Little Bobby is quarter of the size of other lambs. He has already beaten the odds as he was only given a 50 per cent chance of surviving

She said lambs should normally be three or four times Bobby's size by now.

'I've called him Bobby because I love the name, said Ms Kennedy, 'I have to feed him every two hours so 
he's sleeping in a dog bed in my bedroom and I've set an alarm to wake 
me up when it's time for his milk.'

Bobby accompanies Ms Kennedy everywhere now and has 'made friends' her chocolate labrador Bruce.

'They even slept next to each other last night and looked so sweet cuddled up together,' she said. 'I'm really hoping we can get Bobby fit and healthy so he can get back to the farm and meet all of our visitors soon.'

Kelly Bowers, an assistant at the farm, said she could not believe her eyes when she found Bobby shortly after his birth.

'We came in in the morning and Bobby had just been born. He was so small - I couldn't believe how small he was.

'His mum had licked and cleaned him and was busy pushing out the other two babies. We left her to it but once Bobby's brother and sister had entered the world we took him away because he wasn't suckling.

'All the visitors to the park have been marvelling at how tiny Bobby is and saying how cute he is and that they have never seen such a small lamb. I have a pet chihuhua and even he is bigger than our lovely Bobby.'

A regular lamb in the Fishers' Farm flock weighs around 11.2 lbs. The park's 27 ewes started lambing a month ago and all but two of them have already given birth. Bobby's brother and sister have not yet been named.

Little: A normal-sized lamb should normally be three or four times Bobby's size by now. His measurements have been sent to the Guinness Book of Records to see if he is the world's smallest lamb

Attention: Bobby is now being cared for at the home of Rebekah Kennedy, farm manager at Fishers Farm Park, Wisborough Green, West Sussex, where he was born
