The Duchess of Cambridge couldn’t make it – nor could Prince Harry’s girlfriend, Cressida Bonas. So it fell once again to Pippa Middleton to steal the spotlight at yesterday’s big society wedding.

Both William and Harry were there to witness James Meade and Lady Laura Marsham tie the knot in Norfolk, but both came unaccompanied.

It had been rumoured that Kate was due to attend as the newlyweds are part of the couple’s ‘inner sanctum’, but instead she was said to be looking after baby George.

Pippa Middleton looked beautiful in blue as she attended the wedding of Lady Laura Marsham to James Meade at St Nicholas Church, Gayton, Norfolk

Prince William played the role of usher at the wedding of two of his close friends, James Meade and Lady Laura Marsham, and was joined by his brother Harry

William was among 15 ushers who set 
off for a pre-wedding pub lunch from Lady Laura’s family home at Gayton 
Hall opposite St Nicholas Church church.

They travelled the five miles to the Dappling Duck in a shooting party 
trailer, looking like a gazebo on wheels, pulled by a Land Rover.

In
 2011, Mr Meade, son of equestrian gold medallist Richard, gave an 
unofficial  speech at William and Kate’s wedding reception, while the 
bride is the daughter of Julian Marsham, the eighth Earl of Romley.

They were taken by tractor trailer to the church ahead of the bride, who walked from the neighbouring country home of her father, Julian Marsham, the 8th Earl of Romney, who was at her side.

Where's Nico? Pippa looked in high spirits as she walked through the grass and chatted to guests - but her boyfriend was nowhere to be seen

Harry, pictured at the wedding of James Meade and Lady Laura Marsham in Norfolk, yesterday, is expected to mark his 29th birthday with his girlfriend Cressida Bonas and close friend Guy Pelly, among a few others

But despite the ride in the back of a 
tractor, Pippa Middleton still managed to look elegant in a teal lace 
dress by Tabitha Webb, which neatly fitted her toned figure. 

She finished her outfit with a complementing hat, which was adorned with a peacock feather.

The 30-year-old columnist highlighted her tanned skin with a metallic clutch, chunky gold watch and bracelet, and a collection of rings adorning her fingers.

Like her sister's enviable bouncy locks, Pippa's hair was perfectly teased into loose curls.

The glamorous socialite, who wore pink blush and lipstick, was seen chatting to other guests, but there was no sign of her stock-broker boyfriend Nico Jackson.

Pippa was rumoured to have got engaged to the 35-year-old during a recent holiday to Mustique - but there was no sign of a ring on her engagement finger at the wedding.

Lady Laura Marsham married James Meade this afternoon - and were watched by friends and family and cheered on by wellwishers

All smiles! The couple looked overjoyed after tying the knot in the beautifully decorated church, whose entrance was elaborately covered in cream flowers

The Princes and Pippa avoided getting soaked at the ceremony, as the early morning rain gave way to sunshine during the couple's vows at the rural church late this afternoon.

The happy couple have a good friendship with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge that has lasted for years.

The son of Olympic gold medallist equestrian Richard, James Meade is a friend of William's from his days at Eton and is so friendly with Kate that he took her to Badminton Horse Trials during ‘The Split’ when the couple separated for a while in 2007.

Along with Prince Harry, he made a speech at the Royal Wedding. Meade is engaged to Lady Laura Marsham, daughter of the Earl of Romney.

Small crowds of wellwishers and royal fans gathered at points outside the churchyard, with cheers and screams for Harry as he arrived and left the service with friends.

Guests, including Miss Middleton, were taken by tractor trailer to the church ahead of the bride

Hymns could be heard from outside the church, including Jerusalem.

The married couple led the congregation from the church after the hour-long ceremony and they all walked back across a field to the Romney estate, where it is believed the reception is being held this evening.

Like her polished sister, Kate looked dazzling on Thursday evening.

The Duchess beamed as she accompanied husband William to the Tusk foundation gala dinner at The Royal Society in London.

She wore a glittering floor-length Jenny Packham dress covered in sequins with her brunette hair carefully curled over her shoulders and simple, pretty make-up.

Kate finished the look with sparkling stiletto heels and diamond jewellery.

Just last month, Kate made her first public appearance since the birth of Prince George when she attended the Anglesey ultra-marathon with William.

Back in her skinny jeans just five weeks after having her son on July 22, Kate looked sensational - without the slightest sign of baby fatigue - in a green tweed hacking jacket, Zara top and J Brand jeans.

Then, Prince William had revealed that Kate was bearing the brunt of the night duties - and that their son was proving to be quite a nocturnal little fellow.
