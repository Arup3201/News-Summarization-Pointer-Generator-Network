Found dead: Kalbir Dhillon, 44, was discovered in the water near San Francisco airport in January

A woman found dead, floating face-up in the San Francisco Bay after vanishing from her home is yet to be given a cause of death, distressing her grieving family and prompting a hunt for the truth.

Kalbir Kaur Dhillon, 44, had reportedly been arguing with her husband on the night of January 17, when she took off in her silver Mercedes.

Her car was found in the parking lot of the parking lot of the Marriott hotel just outside San Francisco airport.

Joggers found her body floating in the bay not far away. The spot is not far from the runways of the busy, waterside airport.

She reportedly left her home in Fremont, California, after arguing with her husband. It is unclear whether that had anything to do with the death.

Investigators recovered the body, and officials later confirmed her identity. But, according to community newspaper India West, her cause of death is yet to be determined. 

Officers also have yet to say whether the death is being treated as a suicide or a homicide, the paper reported.

Local news station KRON-4 reported that police said there were no immediate signs of foul play.

Dhillon, who was a project manager at Macy's, was born in Leicester, England, and grew up in California.

She had two children from her first marriage. After her husband died in a 1996 car accident, she married again, to Bobby Dhillon, who had two children of his own.

Before the remarriage, in 2012, she had been a single mother for 16 years. Family members spoke of how she made sacrifices for her two daughters, who are now both college students. 

Writing on a Facebook tribute page, her sister wrote: 'Her work history shows her hard work ethic as well as her ambition to continue to grow and surpass personal goals.

'She faced numerous obstacles in life: the death of her first husband, raising two daughters as a single mother, and she pushed through it, and not once did she complain

'She stayed strong with her upbeat personality and remained positive, always focusing on her goals ahead. My sister would never give up. She was the one to fight.'

Fremont Police Department officers reportedly first told the family that Dhillon had only died very shortly before being found, based on forensic evidence. They later decided she could in fact have been dead much longer, raising suspicions.

Distraught family members are now calling on police to investigate more thoroughly.

Dhillon's cousin, Kalbir Pahal, told India West: 'Not knowing the manner of death or the cause of death is very frustrating for us... Things aren’t adding up; there are holes in the stories.' 

A GoFundMe page has been started to raise money for attorney fees to research her death privately. It has raised more than $10,000.

According to family members, there were no signs of injury on Dhillon's body. Her husband told police he had argued with her before her disappearance, according to family sources.

However, Pahal said she did not believe the accident contributed to her death.

The GoFundMe page described her death as 'a complete shock to her family and friends'.

It added: 'she showed absolutely no indication of being upset or having any issues in her day to day life.'
