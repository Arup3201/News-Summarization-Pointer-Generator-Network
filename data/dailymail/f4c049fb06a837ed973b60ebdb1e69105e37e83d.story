Greek Island hopping has traditionally been the preserve of those willing to jump on ferries to sail between different outposts, but one Greek aviation company is hoping to change all that.

Hellenic Seaplanes is hoping to launch a service as early as next year, allowing tourists to hop between different Greek islands by seaplane.

There are currently just 50 airports across the country's 6,000 islands, meaning travellers rely on a ferry service to explore the Mediterranean, but the airline hopes to create affordable flights and offer a whopping 100 connections by 2016.

Successful: Seaplanes are hugely beneficial in other tourist destinations such as Quebec and the Maldives

Making travelling easier: Guests might not have to endure long journeys, changeable timetables and seasickness for too much longer

The company, which is based in Athens
 and was founded in May 2013, recently got the green light to build a 
seaplane waterway at the port of Volos on the mainland.

Their
 next, more ambitious launch, has already been delayed. But all being 
well Crete, Skyros and Pelion should be serviceable by air next May.

Southern Crete is also a focus, allowing travellers easier access to locations such as Frangokastello castle.

Windsurfing
 spot Lefkas, Egkremnoi, Kathisma and Porto Katsiki, which have amazing 
beaches, are also going to linked by seaplane.

It's hoped the plans will attract more visitors and boost tourism in a country emerging from recession.

So beautiful: The stunning Navagio beach at Zakynthos island is surrounded by crystal clear waters

Boss Nikolas 
Charalambous said: 'The creation of a waterways network and development 
of seaplane transport in Greece is now a fact and we will try to cover 
all destinations.

'The 
Maldives and Virgin Islands have shown how seaplanes can contribute to 
the growth of tourism and we have more islands, a longer coastline and 
are close to large European tourist markets.'

The firm currently has a 12-seater Dornier Seastar and 19-seat Twin Otter amphibious aircraft.

The
 seaplanes will not need any costly infrastructure as they are already 
able to land on water; a necessity to reach the smaller islands.
