Britain's Susie Wolff became the first woman to drive at a Grand Prix for 22 years this morning.

But, judging by these pictures, the 31-year-old Scot wasn’t quite as pleased with her results as she might have liked.

After spending just 24 minutes on the famous Silverstone race track, Wolff left the circuit, emerged from the car and was seen wiping tears from her eyes.

Frustrated: Judging by these pictures, 31-year-old Wolff wasn't quite as pleased with her results as she may have liked

She had completed just four laps and was supposed to drive for an hour and a half in total.

The car – a Williams - broke down during the free practice, ahead of this weekend's Formula 1 British Grand Prix, due to oil pressure dropping.

‘The engine has gone - terminal,’ she was told by her race engineer.

The open practice was ahead of the British Grand Prix on Sunday.

Wolff, 31, joined the Williams FI team in 2012 as a development driver, which involves aerodynamic testing, simulator work and track tests.

The high-pressure job involveS test-driving and collecting data before the big races, in a largely male-dominated profession.

The last woman to enter the F1 world championship was Italian Giovanna Amati, who failed to qualify for three races at the start of the 1992 season with Brabham.

Five women have entered F1 races in the past, the most prolific being Italian Lella Lombardi, who started 12 grands prix in the 1970s.

Wolff, who is married to Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, drove this year’s car during in-season testing in May.

She told Mail Online before her turn at Silverstone: ‘If there were just a handful of little girls who saw me driving and suddenly realised they could do the same, that would be the biggest positive to come out of it.

Happy: 'I want to say a huge thank you for all the support - it means a lot and really helps,' she said. 'It was wonderful'

Wolff began karting as a child and in 1996 - at the age of 13 - was named the British Woman Kart Racing Driver of the year.

In 1997, she competed in a number of different karting categories, coming out on top in almost all of them.

In 1999, she competed in the British Formula A Championship and was placed 13th overall.

She then came an impressive 34th in the overall Formula A World Championships and was named British Woman Kart racing driver of the year in 2000.

Speaking to Paul Weaver at the Guardian today, Wolff said: 'It was a really tough day but that’s Formula One sometimes.

'We had an oil pressure problem which cut the engines – the guys are looking at getting it fixed for free practice two.

'I want to say a huge thank you for all the support - it means a lot and really helps. It was wonderful.'
