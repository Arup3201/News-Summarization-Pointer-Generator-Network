Zero turbulence, food service whenever you like and the ability to move about or recline as you wish are some of the benefits to be enjoyed by the lucky few aviation enthusiasts who land one of the Boeing 747 seats up for sale by All Nippon Airways. 

Japan's ANA is selling a total of seven seats from one of its decommissioned Boeing 747-400D planes and is expecting bumper interest from flying fans keen to have a slice of aviation history in their living rooms.

Such is the demand the sale of the seats via the Japanese airline’s online shopping website will be made through a ballot, with registration open from Christmas Day to February 28.

Ryota Isomura, ANA’s trading company, decided to go with a ballot so the seats went to an enthusiast rather than just the highest bidder.

But the seats are by no means cheap, so are certain to go to someone who really wants them.  

The successful bidders will pay 647,000 yen (£3,458 or $5,405) for each of the three single seats and 747,000 yen (£3,992) for one of the four double seats available. The prices include tax and shipping in March, though the sale restricted to domestic sales in Japan.

The plane the seats have been stripped from was taken out of circulation in March this year and will come with the electronics dismantled, a disappointment for those hoping to have their own service button in their living room.

The Boeing 747-400 is one of over 1,400 747s to have been built by Boeing, with this model concluding production in 2009. 

The last of the 747-400D planes, of which 19 were built, was delivered to ANA on February 11, 1996, with the airline retiring the last of its 747s on March 31, 2014.
