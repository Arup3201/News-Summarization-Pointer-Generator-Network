Six men were shot dead in western Pakistan while protecting a Spanish man travelling through the country by bike, police said.

Javier Colorado, who is attempting to cycle around the world, had crossed into Pakistan's western province of Baluchistan from Iran.

Although police reported that he suffered minor injuries, his family posted on his Facebook page that he was unhurt.

Dangerous ride: Cyclist Javier Colorado was being escorted through a violent area of Pakistan when the escort was attacked and all six guards were shot dead

Mr Colorado arrived in the town of Dalbandin, about 220 miles from Quetta, provincial capital of Baluchistan, on Tuesday evening after biking from the Iranian border, said the provincial Home Secretary, Asadur Rehman Gilani.

Local authorities asked him to stay overnight out of concern for his safety and then arranged a police escort of more than a dozen officers to take him to Quetta on Wednesday morning, Gilani said.

When they were in the Mastung district, about 45 miles from Quetta, unidentified gunmen opened fire. The attack came one day after a bus bomb killed 28 Shi'ite 
pilgrims in the same area, and police believe the attack was carried out by the same ground

Six policemen were killed, while Mr Colorado and another nine police officers were wounded, according to police official Mohammed Ibrahim.

Contrasting stories: Pakistani police reported that Colorado was hurt in the attack, however his family were told he was not injured

He was assigned the escort by security
 forces because the province is plagued by kidnappers, Taliban 
militants, a violent separatist insurgency, sectarian killers, 
paramilitary death squads and drug traffickers.

According
 to Mr Colorado's Facebook page, he was planning to cycle around the 
world. Early on Wednesday, he posted ‘Adios Iran, Hola Pakistan’ on his 
page.

Mr Colorado's family also posted a message on his Facebook several hours after the attack:

‘This
 is a message from Javier Colorado's family. In the first place we want 
to thank the Spanish consulate in Pakistan for all their help.

'We've 
received a call from the embassy and they have informed us that Javier 
is well and not hurt. Today he will fly to Lahore, on the border with 
India. His initial intent is to continue his trip.’

Police said they did not know why Mr Colorado had chosen to cycle through such a dangerous area.

In a statement, the Spanish Foreign Ministry reached out to Pakistan over the death of Colorado's guards.

‘The
 government of Spain wants to transmit to Pakistani authorities its 
profound concern and grief’ over the deaths, said the statement.

Two young Czech women taking the same route by bus were kidnapped in March and are still being held.

Shafqat Anwar Shawani, the assistant police commissioner for Mastung district, said six security men and one attacker were killed on Wednesday.

In the same district on Tuesday, a bomb targeting a bus killed 28 Shi'ite pilgrims, many of them women and children. Such sectarian attacks are increasingly common in Pakistan, where Shi'ites make up 20 percent of the 180 million people.

On Wednesday, hundreds of Shi'ites protested against the bus bombing by sitting in the road alongside the bodies of the dead in the provincial capital of Quetta.

The community held similar protests demanding protection after bombings in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, killed around 200 people, mostly Shi'ites, last year.
