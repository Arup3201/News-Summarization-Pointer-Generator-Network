The silent half of illusionists Penn & Teller has revealed the truth behind his wordless stage presence.

Teller, 66, who legally dropped his first name years ago, explained this week that by not speaking at all on stage and communicating with a series of shrugs and gestures, he creates a greater intimacy with his audience.

He was a high school Latin teacher in New Jersey and part-time magician when he met Penn Jillette, a clown college graduate, in the mid-1970s.

Their act turns on contrasting stage personas - Penn is large, loud and brash while Teller is shorter and maintains a mime-like presence throughout the tricks.

In an interview aired on Sunday, Teller told CBS: 'Not speaking is just about the most intimate thing you can do.

'If we just stop and look, that gets intimate fast. That's what I feel when I'm on stage.' 

Penn & Teller have been the headline act at The Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for the past 14 years.

The magic duo are also behind TV shows Wizard Wars and Fool Us which encourage up and coming magic talent.

In 2013, they were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame in honor of their long career. 

The unlikely duo admit that their longevity and success is down to the fact that they don't have a 'cuddly friendship'.

Penn said: 'We were carny trash... we would take any gig we could get. But all of our confrontations happened in the first couple of years.'

Teller added: 'Opposites do sometimes compliment.'

And it's the simplest illusions that keeps Teller hooked on magic. He explained  one of his most beloved tricks - where a red ball seems to move of its own accord towards and around a hoop - really is just a ball, thread and a hoop, which took years of practice to perfect.

'It's a long bit of juggling with me, a ball and one piece of thread,' he said. 'There's no mechanisms off stage.'

Teller explained that being able to draw from his own imagination to entertain is what keeps him returning to the stage after four decades.

He said: 'That great line from ''Sunday in the Park with George'' - it makes me tear up - ''Look I made a hat where there never was a hat''. 

'That pretty much summarizes anybody who makes something artistic - there was nothing there and now something that was in my head is out there.'

In a rare interview, Teller revealed one of his favorite tricks with a red ball and a hoop was one of the most simplest - with no mechanics and years of juggling practice
