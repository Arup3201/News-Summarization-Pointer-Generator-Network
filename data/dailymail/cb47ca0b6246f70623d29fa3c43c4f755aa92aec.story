Facebook is developing its own in-house equivalent to Snapchat, the controversial photo messaging app that has been accused of promoting 'sexting' among youngsters.

Snapchat allows users to send pictures with a time limit - meaning that they automatically delete themselves after a predetermined time has elapsed.

The messaging service has reportedly become popular for sending flirtatious pictures, with recipients unable to hang on to the embarrassing evidence and leak it online.

However, it has come under fire for 
promising more privacy than it can guarantee, since it remains possible 
to take a screengrab of the picture before it self destructs.

Facebook, the world's most popular social network, reportedly plans to launch its own Snapchat-like service in the coming weeks, before the end of the year.

The new app will be standalone and separate from the main Facebook app, AllthingsD reports, bringing the social network's app count up to four including Messenger and Camera - five if you count Instagram.

Snapchat has risen to notoriety over the past year with many commentators accusing the service of promoting irresponsible sexual behaviour among teenagers.

Launched in September 2011, it was reportedly inspired by the the humiliation of New York politician Anthony Weiner, who was caught sending explicit pictures of himself to a woman online.

The service allows users to send pictures to a recipient, while stipulating a time limit during which they can view the images.

This would allow a user to send a 
naked picture to another, but give the recipient, say, only five minutes
 in which to view it before it automatically erases itself.

Facebook could use location metadata to make money from Instagram, the cult photosharing service it acquired for $715million in September.

There have been rumours adverts would soon appear on Instagram's thus far uncluttered user interface but a senior executive for the social network would recently only confirm plans to 'monetise Instagram'.

Facebook's vice president of global marketing Carolyn Everson told Business Insider: 'Instagram continues to grow incredibly fast and we're still a very small team when you think about the amount of people they are reaching.

'There are many brands that use Instagram right now to try to get a feel for how to engage with their followers. We will definitely be figuring out a monetisation strategy.

'When that will happen, I can't comment, but it's going to happen.'

Ms Everson pointedly avoided confirming that adverts would appear on the service, implying that the company may choose to use the wealth of data about Instagram's users to make money.

All photos uploaded from users' mobile phones contain geotagged location data that reveals exactly where the picture was taken. That, combined with Facebook's own facial recognition technology, gives the company a rich seam of data to mine.

According to The Next Web, recent policy changes within the company mean that Instagram user data can be directly passed on to Facebook's corporate customers.

The Next Web comments: 'Facebook could just clutter Instagram with ads, but why would it ever risk that when Instagram can instead serve as a data miner’s wet dream?'

Given the nature of the service, even Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has acknowledged it seems inevitable to be used for explicit pictures, admitting: 'The minute you tell someone that images on your server disappear, everyone jumps to sexting.'

Facebook's version of the app offers pretty much the same service, allowing users to send messages to others that are viewable only for a set period.

The move to come up with their own Snapchat-like app is just the latest in a string of aggressive moves by Facebook to dominate the friend-to-friend communications market, AllthingsD says.

It's just a fortnight since the social network giant updated its Messenger app for Android to allow people without a Facebook account to send messages, in what was seen as an attempt to challenge to messaging service WhatsApp.

The new service is likely to further worry parents who see the proliferation of Snapchat-like services as a potential lure to underage children to distribute explicit pictures of themselves.

The website for the now controversial app features two young, pretty girls and the downloadable program is described as being rated for users over 12 years due in part to 'mild sexual content or nudity.'

However, despite Snapchat's glossy promise to make photo retention harder than before, it has been shown that the program is not foolproof and is open to abuse.

When a user attempts to take a screenshot of another person's picture, Snapchat automatically notifies the sender but it does not stop the recipient from taking a screenshot nor can it prevent another phone or camera taking a picture of the original image.

This has led to worries that the files sent via the service could nonetheless find their way on to the Internet where the original sender quickly loses control of who can get their hands on the explicit images.

Mr Spiegel has denied that his social media tool could promote sexting among youngsters.

'I’m not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be,' he said. 'I just don’t know people who do that. It doesn’t seem that fun when you can have real sex.'

Nevertheless, he has told BuzzFeed that the Snapchat team is 'trying to do a better job educating our users and their parents,' and that he was looking to add more guidance materials to their website soon.
