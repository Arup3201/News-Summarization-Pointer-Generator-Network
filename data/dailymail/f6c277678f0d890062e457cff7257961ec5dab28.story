There is a 43-year-old, 5ft 5in Brazilian that wears the nickname ‘Pe-de-anjo’, or the ‘foot of the angel’.

The name Marcelinho Carioca emerged in conversations after David Luiz earned a garland for his latest artistic execution with one swish of that side-foot, sending the ball swerving at a searing velocity into the top right-hand corner of David Ospina’s goal to defeat Colombia.

Carioca was revered for his unique technique when he approached the dead-ball during a glittering career largely spent in his native Brazil, and this was the reference point for Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari in the aftermath of David Luiz’s strike: ‘We had a player who played in Corinthians, Marcelinho Carioca. He used to kick like that — like no one else. I think (David) watched many videos.'

Now, Brazil has a new angel, in the 
form of Luiz, who hopes to elevate the nation into the heavens by 
inspiring his team with another performance of quite remarkable 
competitive courage – decorated with moments of individual majesty – 
against Germany in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night.

Luiz has emerged as the unmistakeable 
embodiment of this Brazil team, and the guttural release that greeted 
his extraordinary free-kick, hair bouncing, veins bulging and eye 
boggling as he charged towards the Brazilian support, kung-fu kicking 
the corner flag, was the moment of the World Cup so far.

Local pulses are racing, as a nation 
bristles with pride and passion and Luiz is the on-field conductor, 
stirring the emotions of a frenzied Brazilian crowd at every 
opportunity.

He glides forward for set-pieces, 
gesturing at the sea of yellow in the stands, beckoning more devotion 
from the Brazilian congregation.

An awful lot of noise has surrounded Neymar at this World Cup but it is Luiz who 
characterises the Brazilian determination and drive most vividly. He, 
perhaps more than any other player, is riding the tidal wave of emotion,
 seemingly immune to the expectations of hundreds of millions of 
Brazilians watching on, from the Copacabana to the Amazonian jungle.

Luiz etches his name into every game 
at this World Cup, beginning with his visceral rendition of the Hino 
Nacional Brasileiro.

Even the mascots follow his lead, staring into the 
distance, belting out every word, as though it would be an insult to 
sing along at a normal volume.

His performances answer the noise, the
 colour and the endless stream of banners and songs cascading down from 
all sides of the stadium, responding with crashing challenges, forward 
bursts, wonder goals and joyous celebrations.

At times, you do worry whether it will
 all become too much, whether he will lose the sense of himself at a 
pivotal moment, storming into a challenge with excessive haste, 
gallivanting over the half-way line without due regard to his defensive 
duties.

These were the concerns that so 
bothered Jose Mourinho, the inherently cautious coach rarely likely to 
indulge the defender’s more impulsive tendencies. It is why he so 
readily instructed Chelsea to accept the millions of petrdollars on 
offer form Paris Saint-Germain earlier this summer.

Luiz remains a maze of contradictions,
 veering from the sublime to the ridiculous in a moment, and it would be
 no more surprising to see him crowned man-of-the-match against Germany than it would be to see him lose his marker, or a play a loose pass at a
 crucial moment.

You wonder whether Luiz, as a young 
boy, spent anywhere near as much time watching the defending of Aldair 
as he did the free-kicks of Carioca.

For all the defects though, his 
enthusiasm is infectious, his nature incredibly likeable and he is 
perhaps the only member of the 2014 incarnation of Brazil that could 
belong to any era, allaying the dark arts and competitive courage with a
 free-spirited adventure, utterly determined to not only win but also to
 entertain.  

And as he steps out wearing the 
captain’s armband at the Estadio Mineirao, Brazil could hardly wish for a
 better representative to demonstrate all that they wish to represent on
 the global stage.
