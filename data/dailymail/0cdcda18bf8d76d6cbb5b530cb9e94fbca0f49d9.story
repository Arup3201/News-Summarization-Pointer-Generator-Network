The best-selling author Kathy Freston
has flatly denied she is having a lesbian affair following her 
separation from her husband, former Viacom chief Tom Freston.

Page Six reported the nationally
celebrated self-help guru who counts Ellen DeGeneres as a friend, 
embarked on the affair after splitting up with the MTV founder last 
June.

A source told the New
York Post: 'Kathy has appeared on Ellen’s show and has become very 
friendly with her crowd. It is well-known in those circles that Kathy 
embarked on a relationship with a woman called Pam.'

Denial: The best-selling author Kathy Freston has denied she has been having a lesbian affair since splitting up with her husband Viacom chief Tom Freston

But Mrs Freston responded to the claims in an email to the publication saying: 'As flattering as that is, it’s not true.'

The couple met at a Grammy Awards after-party in 1996 and were together for 17 years and married for 14 years.

Last year the media power couple announced their split year in a joint statement which read: 'We've mutually agreed to a 
period of separation. We love each other very much, and are moving 
forward with good will and kindness.'

Claims: Page Six claimed Mrs Freston met the woman called Pam on Ellen DeGeneres's show

Publicity: Kathy Freston appeared on the show last year to promote her book

Their divorce has still not been finalised and Page Six reported a source said that 'negotiations are getting thorny'.

In
2006 Mrs Freston penned a tome entitled The One: Finding Soul Mate Love
and Making it Last and is adored by talk show hosts like Oprah and 
Ellen for her sage insights into spirituality in life and love.

Over
the past few years the enviably trim and youthful Forty-something has 
gradually become vegan and has shared her in depth knowledge of 
nutritional well-being in a series of books and dietary guides.

Mrs Freston, who has nearly 60,000 
followers on Twitter, has not alluded to the claims on the social 
networking site and instead tweeted about animal research.

Mr
Freston, became president of Viacom when it split from CBS, but he was 
forced out of Viacom in 2006, walking away with $60-$85 million in 
severance.

He's since worked as a consultant to Oprah Winfrey as well as chairing the board of Bono’s ONE Campaign.
