David Cameron's aim of slashing the number of people coming to Britain recovered a major boost today, with new figures showing net immigration fell by a third in just a year.

The Prime Minister and Home Secretary Theresa May want to cut net migration from non-EU countries to less than 100,000 before next election in 2015.

New figures show the net flow of migrants to the UK in the year to June 2012 was 163,000, down 34 per cent from 247,000 in the previous year.

A net immigration fell from 247,000 in the year to June 2011 to 163,000 in the year to June 2012, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said

The decline was driven by a drop in 
the number of immigrants coming to Britain, which fell from 589,000 to 
515,000, while the number of migrants leaving the country rose from 
342,000 to 352,000, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.

There
was a ‘significant’ decrease in the number of immigrants arriving from 
New Commonwealth countries, which includes African countries such as 
Botswana, Kenya and Malawi and Indian subcontinent countries such as 
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

A group of influential MPs reacted angrily today to the Government's refusal to remove foreign students from its target.

Despite ministers trumpeting a fall in net migration, the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee said it was wrong that international students were included in the target to reduce non-EU migration to the tens of thousands by 2015.

‘The Government should listen, think again and change course,’ the committee said.

The decline in net migration was driven by a drop in the number of immigrants coming to Britain, which fell from 589,000 to 515,000, while the number of migrants leaving the country rose from 342,000 to 352,000.

Some 197,000 foreign students arrived in the period, down 17% or 42,000 from 239,000 in the previous year, while the number of visas issued for study - 209,804 - was 20% lower.

In a report last year, the BIS Committee said the inclusion of international students in net migration figures risks undermining a world-class export market.

But in an official response released yesterday, the Home Secretary said all the UK's major competitors include students in their net migration figures.

The BIS Committee said: ‘The Government's response was late, woefully short on detail and fails to take account of recent developments.

‘It seeks to underplay the urgency of the problem and thus excuse the failure to act decisively to address this serious matter.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'We are bringing immigration back under control, with net migration cut by nearly a third since the general election.

'But Labour have opposed all the tough reforms which have achieved this.'

He added that under Labour immigration was 'out of control' with net migration into the UK topping 2.2 million.

He added: 'The fact they oppose all the steps we are taking to reform the routes of migration shows that they have learned nothing from their past mistakes.

'Our tough reforms are having an impact in all the right places - we 
have tightened the routes where abuse was rife and overall numbers are 
down as a result.

‘We
will continue to work hard to bring net migration down from the 
hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this 
Parliament and to create a selective immigration system that works in 
our national interest.’

Some
117,000 immigrants from New Commonwealth countries arrived in the UK in
the year to June, down 30 per cent or 51,000 from 168,000 in the 
previous year.

A total of 62,000 immigrants arrived 
from countries which joined the EU in 2004, including Poland, the Czech 
Republic and Lithuania, down 27 per cent or 24,000 from the previous year.

The
most common reason given for migrating to Britain remains study, the 
ONS said, with 197,000 foreign students arriving in the period, down 17%
or 42,000 from 239,000 in the previous year.

The number of visas issued fell 10% or
57,106 to 507,701 in the year ending December 2012 - the lowest 
12-monthly total since comparable data was first published in 2005.

Within the figures, this included 209,804 visas issued for the purpose of study, a fall of 20%.

And 173,000 people migrated to the UK for work, which was down 10% from 194,000 in the previous year.

Immigration minister Mark Harper hailed the figures as proof tough reforms were working

The figures come as the Government toughens its stance on immigration with a range of new measures as it aims to bring down net migration to the tens of thousands.

UK Border Agency officials will conduct interviews with more than 100,000 student visa applicants from ‘high-risk’ countries outside the EU to crack down on bogus students.

And a ‘genuine entrepreneur’ test has been introduced to tackle the rising number of foreign nationals attempting to enter Britain by fudging their bank accounts and setting up fake businesses.

Sponsored visa applications rose 3 per cent in the university sector, but fell 62 per cent, 69 per cent and 14 per cent for further education, English language schools and independent schools respectively.

Labour's Chris Bryant, the shadow immigration minister, said: 'Net migration is falling but public concern is rising. Labour supports strong controls to bring immigration down.

'But these figures demonstrate that the Government is not focussing on the kind of immigration that worries people the most.

'The Government is doing nothing to tackle illegal immigration. The data today shows another fall in deporting people who have broken the rules and another reduction in people being stopped at the border.

'And they are not doing enough to tackle the impact of migration on jobs and housing. Until the Government addresses what most concerns people, anxiety will continue to grow.'
