Nine West millionaire Vince Camuto and his former beauty queen wife Louise have listed their historic Water Mill, New York estate for $49.5 million.

The 21,000 square-foot pile sits on 7.6 acres of prime waterfront land complete with manicured gardens, a tennis court and a 68-foot-long pool.

The opulent mansion has luxurious features including a climate-controlled wine cellar, elevators and a 60-foot-long salon that used to be the grand ballroom.

Passion for property: The Camutos love restoring historic properties to their former glory

The house was originally bought by 
shipyard magnate Edward P. Morse in the late 1910s. Following a few very
 successful years, Morse and his wife expanded the property to its 
current proportions, but sold just a decade later.

The Camutos bought the manor in 2005 from Catholic nuns who had possessed it for 70 years, dubbing the house Villa Maria and using it variously as a school, retirement home and monastery.

When the Camutos acquired the property, its once-luxurious rooms had been divided into dormitories and practical additions such as aluminum-frame windows and asphalt roof tiles as well as extensive water damage had turned its once-sumptuous facade into a shadow of its former self.

The Camutos saw the property's potential, though, and committed themselves to returning the manor to its Jazz Age glory.'There was something magical about the place. Though the nuns couldn’t afford the upkeep or the taxes, they wanted a buyer who would take care of it,' Camuto told Architectural Digest.Camuto, who launched Nine West in the 1970s, is now CEO of the Camuto Group and runs the company with his wife Louise, a former Miss Sweden and interior designer.

The couple told the sisters they wanted to restore the property, 'no matter how long it took.'

Salon: What was once the grand ballroom has become a living area with three different seating areas breaking up the 60-foot-long space

Despite its palatial proportions, the house has managed to retain the character of a beach house - light, airy and relaxed.

The couple called in archtect Andre Tchelistcheff, whose four-year restoration involved modernizing the house but 'without touch screens everywhere.'

The result is elegant simplicity that draws attention to the elegant architecture and stunning natural light that pours through the windows and reflects on the muted, mostly white palatte.

Despite having a 60-foot long living room, a dining room as well as a breakfast room and a master bathroom with a custom-made marble bathtub, Tchelistcheff says the house isn't over-the-top.

'What’s interesting about Villa Maria is that although it’s big, it feels summery, not ostentatious,” he told Architectural Digest.

The incredible a architectural features include the three-storey wrought-iron spiral staircase with a custom-designed chandelier from Mecox and faux-limestone walls painted by a decorative artist.

Sweeping stairs: The staircase spirals up three floors with a custom-made chandelier hanging through its center

A floor to ceiling marble fireplace dominates the 1,682 grand salon (also known as living room) which is divided into three separate seating areas  According to Architectural Digest, the kitchen is painted in a Benjamin Moore white, features custom-made holophane lights by Ann-Morris Antiques and cabinetry by Eppley Building & Design; the oak bench and ebonized bobbin chair are antique.

The library has a domed atrium with abundant greenery adding a further sense of calm, perfect for quiet contemplation.

A solarium connects a family room with heated limestone floors to an adjacent carriage house.

Lap it up: The 68-foot-long pool is perfect for laps and the sun-loungers provide for those who prefer to laze away sunny afternoons

Second to nun: The incredible property was inhabited by Catholic nuns who used it for various purposes for 70 years before the Camutos bought it in 2005

'Vince and Louise wanted to keep the atmosphere light and comfortable because it’s a beach house,' Carol Egan, a Manhattan interior designer who worked closely with the Camutos once the architectural phase of the restoration was complete, said.

The home's grounds and outdoor areas are no less magnificent than its interior.

The deep-green lawn stretches for acres, punctuated by a 68-foot pool and a full-sized tennis court.

Landscape architect Edmund D. Hollander designed the gardens to be lush and abundant but not over-manicured.

From any of the house's patios, panoramic views extend over the Mill Creek and Mecox Bay.

The Camutos, who bought the home for $35 million, are reportedly selling Villa Maria in order to take on a new restoration project.
