Vincent Kompany believes his Manchester City team-mate Yaya Toure is 'not far off' signing a new contract with the Premier League champions.

The City captain penned a five-year deal with Manuel Pellegrini's side in the summer and is confident Toure will be following in his footsteps.

Kompany told the Sunday People: 'What matters most is not that I signed. It is that David Silva, Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov did the same. Now, it’s not far off for Yaya as well.

'This is a very strong sign. All of these players could play for one of the three biggest clubs in the world and they decided to have faith in City.'

Toure's City future was in doubt during the summer following bizarre claims that the Ivorian was upset that his side didn't give him a birthday cake.

The 31-year-old is contracted to City until 2017 but looks set to extend his current deal at the Etihad.

Kompany added: 'I‘ve had a strong relationship with City for years and the decision to extend was normal. I’m looking to the future.'
