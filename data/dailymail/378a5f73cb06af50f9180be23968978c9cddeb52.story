Prince Harry celebrated a marathon charity trek to the South Pole with a group of injured servicemen yesterday, declaring: ‘I think we’ll be having a few whiskies tonight!’

Sporting a fulsome ginger beard after his three gruelling weeks on the ice, the royal was full of praise for his teammates, all of whom have suffered terrible injuries fighting for their country, including one soldier who lost both his legs in Afghanistan.

‘It will just prove to everybody that there’s so much that can be made possible when you think that nothing is left,’ said the prince.

Prince Harry and fellow adventurer Ivan touch 
the South pole today: After more than three weeks pulling sleds across 
the frozen wastes of Antarctica the group stood at the bottom of the 
world at midday

Heroes: The adventurers include 12 servicemen 
and women from the UK and other nations who have suffered terrible 
injuries, including the loss of limbs

Achievement: Their trek took them more than 200 miles across the continent to the geographic South Pole

'The feeling is incredible,' said Ed Parker, the
 expedition's director and co-founder of the Walking With The Wounded 
charity that organised the challenge

The
 Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied challenge saw three teams of
 servicemen – from Britain, the Commonwealth and the US – racing to 
reach the bottom of the world.

The
 teams travelled a distance of 208 miles across some of the most 
inhospitable conditions known to man, with temperatures of up to minus 
50 degrees and biting winds.

Every
 man and woman was also forced to carry a custom built arctic sledge 
known as a pulk, weighing in excess of 11 stone, carrying their kit.

The
 terrain was so challenging that last weekend organisers were forced to 
suspend the race element of the trek and group all the competitors 
together for safety.

Such 
was the camaraderie, however, the men and women linked hands as they 
walked the last few yards of the route to stand together at the bottom 
of the world at 12.48pm.

Army
 air corps pilot Harry, who was also patron of the expedition, said from
 the ice afterwards: ‘Every single one of these twelve deserves it. All 
twelve of them have different reasons for being here….but I’m so proud, 
I’m so chuffed, I’m so privileged to be here with all these guys and 
girls. What an amazing accomplishment.

‘I think we’ll be having a few whiskies tonight and then everyone’s looking forward to getting home. Mission success!’

He went on: '[The team] has dug out blind to get here, 
Duncan you know, it’s just remarkable the fact that someone with no legs
 has made it here, and to have done it in record breaking time, no 
doubt.

'And Ivan as well, when I look across I
 see him being guided around you know, totally blind, from America, and 
absolutely hates the cold, and you know he’s not doing it for himself, 
he’s doing it for his buddies back home, and that goes for everybody, 
every single one here.

'It’s not just 
for the small minority that are here but hopefully in time to come 
through the documentary, and all the stories back home.

'It will just 
prove to everybody that there’s so much that can be made possible when 
you think that nothing is left.'

The
 teams will spent another two nights camping out on the South Pole 
before they can be flown out back to base camp. Harry aims to be back in
 the UK on December 23, just in time for Christmas.

The teams encountered difficult terrain which forced organisers to suspend the competition last weekend and make the expedition a group effort over safety fears, as some competitors were becoming very tired

Victory:
 Prince Harry and his fellow adventurers have reached the South Pole, 
organisers of the Walking With The Wounded charity trek have announced

It
 is hoped their remarkable achievement will raise £2 million for the 
Walking With The Wounded charity, which supports injured ex-servicemen 
and women.

Ed Parker, the 
expedition's director and co-founder of the charity, said: ‘We always 
knew that this wasn't going to be easy, but that is what makes the 
challenge so exciting.

‘Our aim was to show that, despite injury, young men and women from our armed forces can still achieve great things.

‘We
 came down here, determined to get 12 men and women, all injured in 
conflict, to the South Pole, and this is what we have done. The feeling 
is incredible.’

Harry and 
his team mates were accompanied by two other celebrity supporters, 
English actor Dominic West, star of The Wire, and Alexander Skarsgard, 
of hit US series True Blood.
