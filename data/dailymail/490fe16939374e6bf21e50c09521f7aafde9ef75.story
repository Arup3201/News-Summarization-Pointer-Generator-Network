Louis van Gaal says the recently signed contract extension of Manchester United defender Tyler Blackett is an example of the club's enduring faith in their academy set up.

The 20-year-old penned a new deal at the club until 2017 on Thursday, with the option of a further year on Thursday.

Blackett, who can play at either in central defence or at left back, has also seen his weekly wage increase by 1,000 per cent from £2,000 to £20,000.

The highly-rated youngster is the last of three priorities from the club's academy to sign a contract extension after Jesse Lingard and Patrick McNair.

And Van Gaal has cited the new deals of the trio as part of the club's strategy to promote more academy graduates into the United first team.

'Yes, it is the strategy of the club. When I came here there they told me that they wanted to have more youth academy players in the first team,' he said on Friday at the club's press conference ahead of their weekend clash at home to Sunderland.

'Also the rule in the Premier League that you must have a certain amount of players in your own squad is also important.

'I am happy that we can sign players from our youth academy and our players are very popular as we also have a lot of youngsters out on loan and we can pick and select the clubs where the players can play every week, that we have seen also with Reece James, Michael or Will Keane – that is also a strategy.

'I believe in players that you have educated in your own youth academy, maybe that is the reason I am sat here.

Blackett has made 10 appearances this season although his last came on January 11 when United lost 1-0 to Southampton at Old Trafford.
