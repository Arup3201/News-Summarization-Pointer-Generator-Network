A banker's son who was found to have cocaine in his car when he was stopped for jumping traffic lights was let off by magistrates without penalty for the drugs.

Massimo Agostinelli, 26, whose billionaire father Robert Agostinelli, 60, once tried to buy Liverpool FC, sped through an amber light in central London in his girlfriend's black Mercedes.

Officers who pulled him over found he was disqualified from driving and also discovered a biscuit wrapper containing cocaine in the passenger footwell.

Banker's son Massimo Agostinelli, 26, escaped punishment for having cocaine in his car after he was caught jumping traffic lights in London

Agostinelli, of Cadogan Gardens, Chelsea, passed a drugs test and told police he didn't use drugs and that the cocaine must have belonged to a passenger, whom he refused to name.

Today he appeared before magistrates in Hammersmith, west London, for sentencing after he was charged with driving while disqualified and without insurance and possession of Class A drugs.

The court heard Agostinelli was stopped just after 6pm on 30 January after he jumped traffic lights in Sumner Place in South Kensington.

Prosecutor Jade Adenubi said: ‘He was questioned about the drugs in the car and he said in relation to that, that he didn’t use drugs himself.

‘He said they asked him in relation to the item that was seized, the white powder, "Were you aware of what it was?" and he said "I’m not going to lie, I knew what it was".’

Agostinelli said the drugs were left by a ‘degenerate’ and a recreational drug user, the court heard.

The court was told that in interview, the financier's son said: ‘I would rather not say, I don’t want to involve someone else right now.

'He is a recreational drug user who doesn’t really do it that often.'

He said: ‘I was scared, I am not a criminal, I don’t want to be in that world or associated with it.’

Mark Haslam, defending, said that receiving a drugs conviction would have significant consequences for the student who survives on a ‘modest allowance’ from his family.

‘His financial position is that he is a student, he is supported by his family which in turn has given rise to difficulties for him,’ he said.

‘His family live in the US including his dying grandmother, who is dying of cancer,’ added Mr Haslam.

He said Agostinelli accepted the blame for both driving offences, saying that the defendant had not been notified of the ban by the DVLA because he had moved house without notifying the DVLA and thus had not received correspondence from them.

And he said the defendant pleaded guilty to the drugs charge on the basis that the cocaine was in the car, although he said it did not belong to him.

District Judge Quentin Purdy told Agostinelli: ‘I am prepared to treat the drugs matter as being possession in a very technical sense - but not as a drug user or abuser and not with intent to supply.’

'I'm going to make no separate penalty as far as [the cocaine] is concerned - it is an unusual disposal'

‘I’m going to make no separate penalty as far as that is concerned - it is an unusual disposal,’ he said.

But he said it was Agostinell’s responsibility to notify the DVLA of his change of address and issued £200 fines for each driving offence.

Agostinelli was disqualified from driving for eight weeks, and ordered to pay a £40 victim surcharge and £85 prosecution costs.

His father owns private equity firm Rhone Group and is the 416th richest man in the US, according to Forbes.

Earlier this month Mr Agostinelli launched a legal battle against his former fiancee, Charlotte Lucas, to force her to return a £400,000 engagement ring he bought her.

The tycoon has been branded ungallant for making the legal demands of his PR executive former lover, with whom he was in a relationship for six years.
