Robert Hayes-Danson groomed the girl for three years

A paedophile was caught 20 years after abusing his victim when the woman realised she had been groomed after watching a similar storyline on Eastenders. 

Robert Hayes-Danson spent three years grooming the victim, now in her thirties, without being brought to justice. 

But when the woman watched an episode of the soap in which a 12-year-old is sexually exploited by her mother's boyfriend, she realised she had been abused and was not, as she thought, having an 'affair' with the man. 

Her abuser was found guilty of nine counts of sexual assault and two counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child at Preston Crown Court on Thursday. 

The court heard how Hayes-Danson took the girl to local shops and bought her perfume which he told her not to tell his wife about.

The pair watched videos together while Hayes-Danson offered her lifts in his van and invited her to his home in Preston, Lancashire when she was 12, 14 and 15. 

The victim put distance between them when, after his first attempt to have sex with her, Hayes-Danson's wife 'almost' interrupted. 

'I never thought he groomed me. I just thought I was having an affair with him and betraying his wife,' she said. 

When the man had a breakdown in 1993, the woman blamed herself. 

'I thought it was my fault.'

'All this was going on before and I was petrified.

'I thought I had caused him to have this breakdown. I was so scared someone would find out.'

Years later the woman was watching Eastenders when a similar storyline, in which 12-year-old schoolgirl Whitney Dean was exploited by her mother's boyfriend, Tony King, emerged. 

After contacting police the woman appeared in court to face her abuser who shook his head as verdicts were returned.

Judge Jacqueline Beech told him: 'You have been convicted of some very serious sexual offences.

Hayes-Danson from Newton-with-Scales, Lancashire, was told to expect a lengthy prison term when he returns to court next month.'

'You have effectively stolen her childhood and you should be ashamed of yourself.

'You will be sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment. Put your affairs in order for that sentencing hearing.' 

A spokesman for the victim said she was 'relieved' with the outcome of the trial.
