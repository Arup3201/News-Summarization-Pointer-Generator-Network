Undercover footage allegedly shows a woman trying to hire a hit man to kill her ex-husband and his new wife, according to recordings due to be used as evidence at her trial.

Elizabeth Stakelbeck was arrested within a week of meeting an undercover FBI agent who she believed with a contract killer.

The Kentucky mother is heard in the recording saying she wants to make sure her child doesn't get hurt during the hit, and claimed her ex-husband had abused their daughter.

Evidence: Footage of Stakelbeck, above, allegedly hiring a hit man is due to be used at her trial

She allegedly added that she wanted the killing to take place before the couple's next custody hearing.

Stakelbeck was filmed handing over prescription drugs in part payment for the alleged hit, after being told by the undercover agent that it would cost $2,000 for the double killing, the Courier Journal reported.

'Once
you give me that money, that man is dead and she is dead,'  the 
undercover agent said in the footage. 'Ain’t no going back. You won’t have any way of 
getting ahold of me.'

Stakelbeck, who has pleaded not guilty to two charges of criminal solicitation of murder and trafficking a controlled substance, was arrested on August 20 a week after the meeting and recorded phone calls.

She was arrested after handing an undercover agent pills in a container with her name on it, according to Whas11.

At the meeting, she accused her ex-husband of physically and sexually abusing her daughter, and added: 'I just want to make sure my little girl doesn't get hurt.'

She also said in the video Child 
Protective Services had questioned her about coaching her daughter to 
make allegations against her father.

Caught: Elizabeth Stakelbeck was arrested at her Louisville home after the FBI allegedly recorded her trying to hire a hit man

Custody: A judge set Stakelbeck's bond at $250,000 and an emergency protective order was made for her child

As officers swooped in to arrest Stakelbeck at her Louisville home, her ex-husband was taken from his office to FBI headquarters where he was told about the plot.

An emergency protective order was put in place and the ex-husband was told to pick up his daughter and take her to a safe place, because his ex-wife had told police she would rather take the child's life than let Mr Vaughn have custody, WLKY reported.

Stakelbeck is currently being held on $250,000 bond as she awaits trial, according to court records.
