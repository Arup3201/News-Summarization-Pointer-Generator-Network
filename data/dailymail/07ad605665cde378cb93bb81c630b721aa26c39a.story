Astronauts are often thought to be superhuman, defying death every day while they hurtle around Earth at 17,500 miles per hour

In reality, however, the day to day life of an astronaut on board the ISS can, for long stretches, be mind-numbingly dull.  

From reporting food packaging mistakes to tackling problems of urinating, what occupies an astronauts mind is often less exciting than you might think.

Anonymous journal entries, released by Nasa, have been described as similar to 'gossip columns' rather than the serious issues discussed in Star Trek’s Captain’s Log.

One of the clearest topics that occupied the minds of those on board the ISS were frustrations with everyday tasks.

‘It was a frustrating day,’ wrote one astronaut. ‘The urine collection started disastrously first thing this morning.

‘I think I got about 75 per cent in the bag; the rest was all over me. Not a good way to start the day.’

'Interesting, how you can be on top of the world one moment (literally) and then be completely demoralised the next, because of what is said on the ground.'

'Sunday is meant to be a day of rest, but somehow Houston managed to make it feel like Monday.'

'I was awakened in the middle of the 
night by the ground telling me to close the shutter on the lab window. 
It is beyond me why it couldn't wait until wake-up time.'

An analysis by journalist Aviva Rutkin of New Scientist identified several major themes from these entries, including complaints about Houston, an obsession with food and homesickness.

But what really stuck out was the banality of day to day activities.

‘One
 last funny story – during the first month of our stay, I noted that the
 labelling on two types of food packets were backwards,’ said one 
entry. 

‘Today I wanted 
chicken teriyaki. So, I gambled that the labelling problem had not fixed
 for the new batch of food that came up recently, and selected “Beef 
Tips with Mushrooms”.'

‘I was rewarded for not having overestimated Nasa! The chicken was in the packages labelled beef.’

The crew writings, however, were more than just an exercise in maintaining a diary of daily thoughts and events.

By looking at their entries, researchers were able to gain insights into the mental and emotional well-being of the astronauts.

'It comes out looking like a gossip column, I'm sure,' said astronaut Sunita Williams before she arrived at the space station. 'But the point is to identify characteristics that will make expeditions successful.'

Jack Stuster of Anacapa Sciences in Santa Barbara, California, was the first to suggest astronauts keep a diary as part of a scientific experiment.

He was inspired by the logs and journals of polar explorers and diaries from occupants in the South Indian Ocean and in Antarctica.

‘Studying small groups living and working in isolation and confinement is much like studying social issues with a microscope,’ said Professor Stuster.

‘There is much that can be learned from the approach that is relevant to nearly all human experience.’

It also proved to be a cathartic experience for many of the astronauts on board.

‘With time on my hands for half an hour, I feel slightly melancholy, for some reason,’ one astronaut wrote.

‘This happens quite often in space, among astronauts in general (and cosmonauts), and space seems to somehow amplify our emotions, positive or negative, however they might be.

‘Maybe it is the remoteness, or the beautiful scene outside, or a consciousness that we are in a unique situation, benefiting from the work of others.’

The thoughts and experiences contained in the writings remained anonymous; only the individual keeping the journal and the investigator had access to the documents.

But while they may reveal the banality of life on the ISS, they also highlight its incredible beauty.

‘I think I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to understand what I saw here every day for six months,’ wrote one astronaut.

‘The view is awe-inspiring and beyond comprehension.’

The concept of a 'day' aboard an orbiting spacecraft is a abstract: every 24 hours, astronauts on board the ISS will experience 15 dawns as the station speeds around the world.

In a blog post while he was onboard the ISS< astronaut Don Pettit addressed the topic of timekeeping and the 
challenge of balance.

'When humans venture into a harsh wilderness, the fraction of time on 
task shrinks, while the effort to simply be there grows,' said Pettit.

'You are lucky to log six hours of mission tasking and six hours of 
sleep. The rest of the time is spent simply trying to stay alive.'

When there are no immediate dangers, the crew focuses on scheduled 
workloads and daily routines.

The breakdown may vary from day-to-day, 
but in general includes a 1-hour meeting with mission control, a 12-hour
 workday, a second 1-hour mission control tag up, and an hour to 
finalise tasks before dinner. S

leep and personal time fall within the 
remainder of the 24-hour day. 

Within the 12-hour working day, there is a further breakdown of tasks. 
In general, this comes to 6.5 hours on primary mission tasks, such as 
research, operations, and maintenance.

The crew members also spend 2.5 
hours on physical training for both research goals and their own health.
 What time remains is quickly consumed by preparations for the primary 
tasks, unplanned repairs, and general upkeep to maintain smooth 
conditions throughout the mission.
