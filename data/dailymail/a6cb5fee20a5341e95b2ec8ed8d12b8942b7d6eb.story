In his immaculate 
blue dress uniform, Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair stood ramrod straight
 before a judge Thursday and pleaded guilty to three charges that could 
send him to prison for up to 15 years.

It was a
 remarkable admission sure to end the military career of a man once 
regarded as a rising star among the U.S. Army's small cadre of trusted 
battle commanders.

Sinclair, 51, still faces 
five other charges stemming from the claims of a female captain nearly 
20 years his junior who says the general twice forced her to perform 
oral sex. But by pleading guilty to the lesser charges, Sinclair's 
lawyers believe they will strengthen his case at trial by potentially 
limiting some of the salacious evidence prosecutors can present.

Adulterer: General Jeffrey Sinclair pleaded guilty yo committing adultery, which is a crime in the military

The
 former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne could be sentenced to life
 in prison if convicted of the sexual assaults. Opening statements were 
expected Friday.

Asked by judge Col. James 
Pohl whether he clearly understood the consequences of his admissions, 
the decorated veteran of five combat deployments answered in a clear 
voice, with no emotion: 'Yes sir.'

Pohl 
accepted Sinclair's plea after nearly three hours of often intimate 
questions about the married general's flirtations and dalliances with 
four women - three military officers and one civilian.

Repeatedly,
 Sinclair turned to his lawyer before answering, prompting the judge to 
say: 'It's important that you tell me the truth as you recall it.'

'You'll get nothing but the truth from me,' the general replied.

The
 case against Sinclair, believed to be the most senior member of the 
U.S. military ever to face trial on sexual assault charges, comes as the
 Pentagon grapples with revelations of rampant rape and sexual 
misconduct within the ranks. The U.S. Senate on Thursday blocked a bill 
that would have stripped senior military commanders of their authority 
to prosecute rapes and other serious offenses in the ranks. The bill was
 firmly opposed by the Pentagon.

The general 
pleaded guilty to having improper relationships with two female Army 
officers and to committing adultery with a third, the captain who was 
his longtime mistress. Adultery is a crime in the military.

When
 asked by the judge if he was aware of the prohibition against senior 
officers having relations with subordinates, Sinclair replied, 'Oh, yes 
sir.'

He then described how the affair began 
during a war tour in Iraq when his primary accuser asked if he wanted to
 watch a movie. Once they were alone in his quarters, the general said 
the young officer made sexual advances that he initially rebuffed.

Pohl asked how Sinclair knew the woman wanted to have sex with him.

'Probably when she took her top off, sir,' the general said with a nervous chuckle.

Sinclair's
 wife of nearly 30 years has remained with him through his legal 
troubles and served as a staunch public defender, though she was not in 
the courtroom Thursday. The couple has two children.

The
 general admitted to violating orders by possessing pornography and to 
conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. After he knew he was 
under investigation, Sinclair also said he deleted nude photos from a 
personal email account sent by a civilian woman with whom he was 
childhood friends.

Sinclair's lawyer Richard 
Scheff has said the plea will strengthen the general's legal position. 
By admitting guilt on the charges for which there is the strongest 
evidence, the married father of two hoped to narrow the focus of the 
trial to charges that rely heavily on the testimony and credibility of 
his former mistress.

In pleading guilty to 
possessing a cache of porn on his laptop in Afghanistan, a violation of 
orders for soldiers in the socially conservative Muslim country, 
Sinclair's defense hopes to limit the ability of prosecutors to use 
those graphic images to shock the jury.

Prosecutors
 also have evidence Sinclair asked two female officers to send nude 
photos of themselves to him. By conceding his guilt, the defense lessens
 the relevance of the messages they exchanged. The primary accuser is 
the only one alleging assault.

Scheff said 
Sinclair had long offered to plead guilty to the three charges as part 
of a plea agreement, but the Army refused to make any deal without an 
admission on the alleged assault.

'What 
remains of this case really rests on the damaged and tattered 
credibility of an individual who's not been truthful, who has lied 
before the court, who has given inconsistent statements,' Scheff said 
outside the courthouse. 'Frankly, I think it's an embarrassment that 
this case will go forward. But it's going forward, and we'll have not 
guilty verdicts at the end.'

The defense will 
present evidence that the female captain lied under oath during a 
pretrial hearing in January about her handling of old iPhone containing 
messages between her and the general. Lawyers for Sinclair have painted 
the woman as a scorned lover who only reported the sexual assault 
allegations after the general refused to leave his wife.

The
 captain testified that on Dec. 9, shortly after what she described as a
 contentious meeting with prosecutors, she rediscovered the iPhone 
stored in a box at her home that still contained saved text messages and
 voicemails from the general. After charging the phone, she testified 
she synced it with her computer to save photos before contacting her 
attorney.

However, a defense expert's 
examination suggested the captain powered up the device more than two 
weeks before the meeting with prosecutors.

The Associated Press generally does not identify those who say they were sexually assaulted.

During
 a pretrial hearing this week, a top Pentagon lawyer testified that the 
lead prosecutor assigned to the case for nearly two years, Lt. Col. 
William Helixon, had urged that the most serious charges against 
Sinclair be dropped after he became convinced the captain had lied to 
him about the cellphone. Helixon was overruled by his superiors and 
removed from the case last month, after suffering what was described as a
 profound moral crisis that led to his being taken to a military 
hospital for a mental health evaluation.

The 
new lead prosecutor, Lt. Col. Robert Stelle, said in court this week he 
doesn't care what his predecessor thought about the weakness of the 
evidence.

It is highly unusual for an officer 
of flag rank to face criminal prosecution, with only a handful of cases 
in recent decades. Under military law, an officer can only be judged at 
trial by those of superior rank.

Sinclair's jury is comprised of five major generals.
