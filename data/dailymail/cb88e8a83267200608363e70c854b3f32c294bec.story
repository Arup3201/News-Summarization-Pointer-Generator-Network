An astronaut aboard the International Space Station has become the first person ever to control a robot on earth from space.

Flight engineer Chris Cassidy remotely controlled the K10 rover based in California from space to simulate deploying a radio telescope.

The mini mission was designed to test how well a crew member in space can remotely control a robot, whether it is on the surface of a moon, planet or asteroid.

Cassidy took the rover, based at the Ames Research Centre in California, on a remote test drive before using it to deploy the simulated antenna.

Aboard the space station, he used live video from the rover and virtual terrain displays to give him a view of the rover's activities on Earth.

The technology demonstration aimed to explore how communication delays over vast 
distances affect an astronaut’s ability to take supervisory control of 
an automated rover if it gets into a difficult area.

Terry Fong, director of the Intelligent Robotics Group at Ames said: 'We successfully conducted the first "surface telerobotics" test session with the International Space Station.

'Cassidy used K10 to perform a surface site survey and to begin deploying a simulated Kapton film-based radio antenna.'

Fong told Space.com that further test drives between the rover and the space station will take place in July and August.

They will concentrate on completing and inspecting the antenna deployment as well as studying the interaction between the human and the robot.

The test is the first simulation of a human-robot 'waypoint' mission, which involves an idea to deploy a telescope on the far side of the moon.

The concept is proposed by experts at the University of Colorado and Lockheed Martin, which is building the multi-purpose Orion spacecraft for Nasa.

The K10 rover carries out a surface study using its cameras and on-board laser system. Such a robot could be used to deploy a radio telescope on the far side of the moon in the future

The proposed mission to the Earth-moon L2 position, would see astronauts on board an Orion spacecraft remotely place a low radio frequency telescope on the far side of the moon, using robots.

The aim of the mission is to track down the 'cosmic dawn' of the universe that followed within 100 million years of the Big Bang.

The location has been chosen as it is a 'radio quiet place' in the inner solar system, which will allow sensitive observations to be made about the first stars and galaxies.

Cassidy was one of the astronauts to make a rare, hastily planned space walk from the International Space Station in May this year.

He helped to replace a pump outside the station to plug a serious coolant leak.

Ammonia coolant was leaking from the power system on board the International Space Station.
