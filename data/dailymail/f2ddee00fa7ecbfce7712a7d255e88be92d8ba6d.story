Two prisoners today appeared in court charged with murder after a child killer was found dead at the high-security Long Lartin jail in Worcestershire

Fomer salesman Subhan Anwar, 25, was sentenced to 23 years in prison for torturing and battering his partner’s two-year-old daughter to death.

Two fellow prisoners, Gary David Smith, 47, and Lee William Newell, 44, appeared at Worcester Magistrates today accused of his murder.

Both men were remanded in custody to appear at Worcester Crown Court on Tuesday February 19.

Cruelty: Subhan Anwar, left, was jailed for 23 years for murdering partner Zahbeen Navsarka's, right, daughter

Horrific: Sanam Navsarka suffered 107 injuries during a month of 'unbelievable' cruelty before she died

West Mercia Police said Anwar’s body was found at 8pm on Thursday by 
prison officers at the category A jail, which houses some of the 
country’s most dangerous criminals.

A post mortem examination found his neck had been broken.

Anwar was jailed for life in 2009 after being convicted of murdering his partner’s toddler, Sanam Navsarka.

The youngster suffered 107 injuries during a month of ‘unbelievable’ 
cruelty in which she was battered with metal poles and had all four 
limbs broken.

Horror: Two 'tramline' bruises showed where Sanam had been hit with this metal pole

The child, who was afraid of the dark, was ‘disciplined’ by being 
repeatedly locked in an unlit cupboard, while Anwar also put her in a 
tumble drier and dumped her in a bin for his amusement.

Sanam suffered further agony when aftershave was splashed on her nappy 
rash and open sores. She was not taken to a doctor, so her fractures 
remained untreated.

In her final days she was suffering so much from her injuries that she 
could not walk and died when fat deposits from her broken bones entered 
the bloodstream, Bradford Crown Court heard.

A post-mortem examination revealed that along with her broken arms and 
legs, there were 36 bruises to her head and neck, 26 to her arms and ten
to her abdomen.

Her death came only three months after married mobile phone salesman 
Anwar met the child’s mother Zahbeena Navsarka at the shop where he 
worked in Huddersfield.

Anwar had sex with Navsarka in the back of the shop on the day they met
and he swiftly left his pregnant wife to move in with his new lover. To
cover their tracks after the child died in 2008, they told detectives 
she was left alone in the bath for ten minutes and was found dead.

But Anwar, described as brutal and domineering, was convicted and jailed
for a minimum of 23 years.

Navsarka was cleared of her daughter’s 
murder but found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years in 
prison.

Judge Peter Thornton QC said it was a ‘truly terrible case’ and told the
defendants: ‘It is almost unbelievable the pain and anguish she must 
have suffered, not just once or twice, but repeatedly and persistently 
over weeks at your cruel and selfish hands.’

He added: ‘Your deliberate cruelty is beyond belief. Humanity has let her down.’

In 2011, social worker Judyth Kenworthy was suspended for failing to 
pass on vital information about Sanam’s abuse a week before she was 
murdered.

She was found guilty of misconduct by the General Social Care 
Council.
