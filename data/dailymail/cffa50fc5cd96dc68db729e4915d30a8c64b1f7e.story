They are the equivalent height of a 90-storey building.

But these Chinese power grid workers don't seem too fazed by the dizzying heights of the world's tallest pylons.

The men are required to work at a height of 885ft (270 metres) as they install a crossing tower for a new line of ultra high voltage cable stretching from Anhui province to Shanghai - a distance of 268 miles.

The tower is just one of 1,421 starting west from Huainan. The men have until the end of 2013 to finish the ambitious project.

A head for heights: The men work on one of 1,421 electricity pylons that will stretch from Huainan, Anhui province to Shanghai

Tall order: The length of pylons stretches 268 miles. The project is due to be finished next year

Stiff neck: The Chinese men are working at a height of 885ft - the equivalent of a 90-storey building

By comparison: Big Ben, left, is 316ft high while the UK's tallest pylons are a mere 164ft in comparison to China's monster towers

The workers are strapped into safety harnesses but use flimsy rope ladders to go up and down the pylons.

More than 500billion KWH of electricity per year will travel along the cables.

The workers have now reached the most important section across the Yangtze River.

Long journey: Driving the route of the proposed pylons would take around six hours

Terrifying: The men all wear safety harnesses but go up and down the pylon on flimsy rope ladders

Vital power source: More than 500billion KWH of electricity per year will travel along the cables
