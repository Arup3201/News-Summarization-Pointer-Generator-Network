A gang of Asian men were arrested during pre-dawn raids yesterday on suspicion of being part of a Home Counties paedophile ring.

The eight suspects were hauled from their homes at around 5am by 100 officers after a three-month investigation into child exploitation.

Police carried out the raids after a teenage girl told them how she had been raped and abused for five years from the age of 12.

Search: The Buckinghamshire home was one of eleven targeted in the series of dawn raids yesterday

Although only one victim has come 
forward so far, detectives believe the paedophile ring could be 
responsible for abusing several other girls.

Officers are understood to be 
investigating claims that one of the 10 homes in High Wycombe, 
Buckinghamshire, which were raided was used to host parties where girls 
were abused.

The victim who has come forward is 
understood to have told a social worker how she was ‘handed around among
 the men’ for five years.

Three months ago the girl, now 16, 
felt confident enough to give police an official statement revealing the
 extent of the abuse she suffered.

She told how she was groomed by a man 
who she believed to be her boyfriend before he callously passed her to 
other men in the paedophile ring.

Detective Superintendent Rob Mason, of
 Thames Valley Police, said the nature of the allegations were ‘at the 
most serious end of the sexual abuse scale’.

‘She was sexually abused by that male 
but he also subsequently introduced her to a number of his associates 
and the sexual abuse continued,’ he said.

‘We are anxious to identify the full scale of the abuse that has occurred.’

Last night neighbours living next to 
one of the homes that was raided claimed it was often used for wild 
late-night parties by Asian men.

The modest terrace home in a quiet cul-de-sac was broken into using a police battering ram at 5am yesterday.

Forensic experts spent most of the day collecting evidence from the house while a van of uniformed officers remained nearby.

One neighbour, who asked to remain 
anonymous, said: ‘There were groups of them, Asian men, who would drive 
up in nice cars - BMWs and Mercedes - and have parties there.

‘They didn’t live there. I don’t think anyone was living there. They just used the house for parties. The men looked well off. I feel sick 
thinking about it.’

All 10 men, aged between 20 and 28, were arrested on
 suspicion of committing various sexual offences against the girl.

The investigation, codenamed Operation
 Ribbon, was led by Detective Chief Inspector Vince Grey who made an 
appeal for other victims of abuse to come forward.

He said: ‘With this particular victim,
 she’s mainly discussed actions involving herself, not going into any 
great details in terms of other persons, but we believe in terms of what
 she told us that there will be other victims.

‘She’s been extremely brave and 
courageous in coming forward in the first place. Obviously we can’t 
imagine what she and other victims have gone through.

‘She’s come forward and she’s 
indicated what offending has happened to her, who’s been involved in 
that, and over what time period.’

The officer added: ‘We will not 
tolerate child exploitation in Thames Valley and today’s warrants are 
part of a lengthy investigation spanning many months.

Warning: Residents in High Wycombe were given this letter from police telling them about the sex abuse gang arrests

‘We believe that it is likely that 
there are more victims who have not yet spoken to the police and would 
like to encourage anyone who is a victim to come forward and speak to 
us.

‘Our number one priority is to protect
 the victims, both their identities and wellbeing in such cases.’ The 
teenage girl at the centre of the alleged paedophile ring has now been 
taken into care.

'The alleged offences are utterly vile and I’m sure everyone will join me in condemning them. The whole of Wycombe will stand against these despicable crimes irrespective of the ethnicity of the offenders'

 said: ‘The alleged offences are utterly vile and I’m sure everyone will
 join me in condemning them.

‘The whole of Wycombe will stand against these despicable crimes irrespective of the ethnicity of the offenders.

‘But we must remember that people are innocent until proven guilty.

‘And it must not be forgotten that we 
have learnt from bitter experience in the past weeks, months and years 
that paedophilia is not confined to one segment of society.’

The arrests
 are the second high profile investigation into suspected child sex 
gangs which Thames Valley Police has conducted.

In March officers from the force made a
 string of similar arrests in Oxford during an investigation called 
Operation Bullfinch. Nine men are expected to face trial next year.
