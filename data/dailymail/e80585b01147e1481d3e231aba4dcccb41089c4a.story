A chance find in a  thrift store has awakened a whirlwind of emotions for one World War II veteran.

Bill Moore, 90, was brought to tears recently when he read a long-lost love letter he sent his future-wife Bernadean Gibson 70 years ago, when he was a strapping young soldier, fighting with Patton's Third Army in Europe.

The letter was discovered tucked inside an old record purchased at a thrift store by  Ilene Ortiz of Westminster, Colorado, who worked to reunite the letter with Moore's family.

Memories: Bill Moore was brought to tears as he read a long-lost letter that he sent his future-wife Bernadean Gibson 70 years ago, while fighting in World War II

Surprise: The letter was discovered recently by a woman in Colorado who found the note tucked into a album case she bought a thrift store 

Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in all my life as I am for you,' the letter ends

 'When you're apart for that reason, not knowing if and when you'd ever see that person again, every chance you got to communicate was just wonderful,' Moore said of the letter. On the left, a picture of Bernadean from the time, and on the right, a picture of her future- husband in his uniform 

The discovery took Moore completely by surprise, and he both cried and laughed as he read the flowery note to the girlfriend he met on furlough. 

'My darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean,' the letter reads. 'I ran out of space, but I could have written a lot more adjectives describing you. You are so lovely, darling, that I often wonder how it is possible that you are mine. I'm really the luckiest guy in the world, you know. And you are the reason, Bernadean. Even your name sounds lovely to me.'

The letter dated 1945 was a preface to the Moore's 63 years of marriage, in which they raised three children. 

'When you're apart for that reason, not knowing if and when you'd ever see that person again, every chance you got to communicate was just wonderful,' Moore told KMGH. 

However, it is also a painful reminder of Mrs Moore's passing. Bernadean died in 2010, and her husband currently lives in a care home for veterans.

Meant to be: Moore sent the letter to is then-girlfriend Bernadean who he met on furlough. When he returned from war, the two got married and stayed together for 63 happy years of marriage. Bernadean died in 2010

Today: Moore now lives in an assisted-living home for veterans. He says the letter was difficult to read because it's a reminder that Bernadean is no longer with him 

'It's difficult talking out loud about it to other people,' Moore said. 'But I loved her, and she loved me. That's all I can tell you. It’s a heartache not being with her all the time.'

Last month, Ortiz spoke out about the search to find the rightful owner of the loving letter. 

Ortiz purchased the album at a local thrift store and later found the letter back at home - though she can't remember exactly which album the letter was hidden away in.  

Ortiz contacted ABC affiliate KMGH for help in finding the relatives of the subjects of the letter and together they located the deceased mother Bernadean and elderly father Bill's  daughter Melinda Gale, 48. 

Melinda Gale held back tears as she read the touching letter from her father to her mother 70 years ago.  

She told ABC she never could have imagined her father, a mechanical engineer, would use the flowery and loving language that he did.  

'It's just when I get so horribly, terribly lonely for you that I write letters like this,' the letter continues.

'I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you.'

'My hands were shaking when I finished reading it,' Gale said emotionally.

'It’s truly was a window into how deep their love was. And obviously, they were married for almost 63 years. We knew they loved each other very, very much, but as children you don’t see that. Where it came from, that deep connection, and this was a window into their story. He was a mechanical engineer. I cannot believe he shared these deep emotional words with her,' she shared.

Gale and her history teacher sister always had a fascination with their father's experience in the war and in 2000 took a trip to Europe to retrace his steps.

True loves: Bill and Bernadean Moore raised three children, now all grown 

'Mom had never gotten to see everywhere he had been. We did this amazing trip so I can picture exactly where he was on December 29 of 1944, sitting in this miserable, cold, dark forest in the northern region where France, Germany and Belgium all meet.'

Gale told ABC she thinks her mother may have slipped the letter into the record for safe keeping because it was special to her.

Even though Ortiz says she can't remember which record she found the letter in, Gale has her own theory.

Gale explained that her mother and father's special song was 'I'll be seeing you,' from the Broadway musical Right This Way.

Mom’s song for dad was ‘I’ll Be Seeing You,' she said. 

'I’m sure it was in there.'

'What a sweet, wonderful Valentines gift to give our family,' Gale said.

'I didn’t get to meet this wonderful lady who found the letter, but I just can’t thank her enough.'

Gales plans to give the letter to her father who lives in a veteran's assisted care facility.
