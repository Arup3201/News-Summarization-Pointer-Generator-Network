Whatever the upshot from that New York lawyer’s bizarre appeal against his own report into allegations of World Cup bidding corruption – and don’t hold your breath on that one – England’s claim to the moral high ground has been blown from under their feet.

Whether or not FIFA’s ethics committee have finessed – twisted even – Michael Garcia’s findings with regard to Qatar 2022, the Football Association are in the dock for the way they went about campaigning to host the 2018 finals instead of Russia.

Of all people, the custodians of our national game crawled into bed with the disgraced Jack Warner who FIFA, none other, have kicked out of their vice-presidency and who has been cited for fraud by the governing body of football in the Americas, of which he used to be president.

Warner told Prince William and David Cameron and David Beckham he would vote for England - then reneged

England bid team could be punished over 2018 World Cup efforts... but Qatar are cleared to host 2022 event!

Russia 2018 bid's computers and emails 'destroyed', say FIFA

Who is Michael Garcia? Sportsmail's lowdown on FIFA investigator 

They granted lavish favours and squandered millions on this treacherous figure who did not even vote for England when it came to casting his ballot.

In so doing the FA dragged their own president, Prince William, two of this country’s Prime Ministers, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, our ultimate Olympian Lord Coe and even poor old unsuspecting David Beckham, among many, into the mire with them.

It used to seem that the FA were merely naïve and incompetent when it came to international football affairs.

Now, with this shabby business following their reneging on the gentleman’s agreement not to bid against Germany for the 2006 World Cup, they appear at best stupid, at worst as dodgy as those they have presumed to impugn.

While it may seem disproportionate for England’s dubious dealings to catch most of the back-draft from an investigation into something as serious as how over-heated Qatar came to be awarded a World Cup, there can be no escaping the FA’s sorry reality now.

After the humiliation of receiving only two votes for 2018 this, the mother country of the global game, is now a broken off-shoot from the world football community, bereft of even the slightest influence.

After all the English ranting at FIFA, long is it likely to remain so.

As for the tin pot MPs who have done nothing about bent bankers, failed to indict Tony Blair for going to war under false pretences or call their own House to order for fraudulent misconduct - but have been falling over themselves to jump on the populist anti-FIFA bandwagon - they are left clinging to an American lawyer’s coat-tails.

Good luck with that, since Garcia will be perceived in many quarters abroad as trying to distance himself from the backlash on social media following Qatar’s absolution from wrong-doing, in case it damages his ambition of high office in Washington.

And as for the backlash itself – whipped up as it is here by jingoistic resentment of England not being given the 2018 World Cup – the most popular remedies being suggested are impractical.

Resign from FIFA, they cry. Boycott the World Cup.

Former FIFA vice-president Warner has been kicked out of the organisation

Quite simply, the FA cannot afford to do that. Already grappling with the financial implications of the new Wembley and the centre of coaching excellence, they need not only big England international matches to avoid the risk of going broke but – like it or not – their share in the financial windfall from World Cups.

And even if they did pull out, they would find themselves isolated. There is a notion that the US, if no-one else, would walk with us. That founders on their understanding that FIFA will take the World Cup back to North America soon, perhaps in 2026, the successor to Qatar.

There are few echoes abroad of the uproar in this country. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is a racing certainty for re-election in May because the overwhelming majority of national federations appreciate the billions he generates for the sustenance and development of football around the planet.

As for Garcia’s protest, the FIFA appeals committee is manned mostly by representatives of the countries in most urgent need of that income.

Our hitherto invisible MP have started demanding examination of the World Cup bidding process by governments and their police forces.

They seem unaware that the most relevant national state, given that FIFA is based in Zurich, recently completed an exhaustive criminal investigation. Their principal target was Blatter, whom they ultimately cleared of all suspicion. Nor did they find anything to indict in FIFA’s governance of football.

The Sir Alf Ramsey statue in Ipswich

Not only that but the ghastly Warner is only one of half-a-dozen or so officials who have been rooted out by FIFA with far greater alacrity than our government have ousted the crooks in the City and in Parliament.

Wherever the Qatar fandango leads it won’t be England sign-posting the direction – or hosting a World Cup in most of our lifetimes.

Cheers to Sir Alf Ramsey - help save this local pub 

The locals are revolting.

Patrons of The Sir Alf Ramsey in Tunbridge Wells are fighting to prevent the demolition of the only pub named after England’s World Cup-winning manager.

They are asking football lovers around the country to help them lobby politicians in Kent and the editor of the local Courier newspaper, as well as taking to social media.

Pressure is mounting against planning application by the owner for the building to be sold, knocked down and replaced by four homes.

There are two notable monuments to Sir Alf, a statue in Ipswich which became his home town during his successful time there as manager and a bust of his head in the players’ tunnel at the new Wembley Stadium.

Both are impressive.

But the pub stands alone in preserving a priceless World Cup memory, that of how he used to buy his players ‘just one beer’ at the England team hotel on the evenings before their big matches.
