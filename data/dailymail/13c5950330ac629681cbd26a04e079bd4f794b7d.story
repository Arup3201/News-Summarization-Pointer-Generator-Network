A collection of surgical equipment that belonged to a Nazi concentration camp commandant is being put up for auction this week.

The wooden box of tools
belonged to Anton Burger, a major in the SS who worked at the Theresienstadt concentration camp between July 1943 and February 1944, where 140,000 Jews were held  -  and 33,000 of them died.

News of the sale has provoked outrage in the Jewish community. Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies, the main representative body of British Jews, said that 'to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects is deeply troubling'.

Other Jewish groups, including the Anne Frank Trust and Holocaust Educational Trust, said that the collection should be placed in an educational context, such as a museum.

Theresienstadt was used as a propaganda tool during the Second World War, with the Germans trying to fool the world that it was a 'paradise camp'.

Disturbingly, given the contents of the box, there is no evidence that Sturmbannfuhrer Burger ever received medical training. A separate layer above the forked hooks reveals a sinister set of scissors

The case is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed instruments'. This has led to the theory it may have been part of the deception to fool the Red Cross into thinking it was for musical instruments

They even made a film showing happy 
workers shoeing horses and making handbags, while children played 
football or ate sandwiches to add to the deception.

Burger played a key role in covering up the true horrors of the camp during stage-managed visits by the Red Cross - which were used to
help conceal the sickening purpose behind it and other camps from the watching
world.

The mostly monogrammed equipment - which has a guide price of
£2,000 to £4,000 - has been
put up for sale at a small auction house in Bude, Cornwall, by an anonymous
seller.

Grace Cloke, from Villa Hall Auctions, explained that the husband of the vendor
was Jewish, and his parents met and married at a concentration camp in Austria.

Ms Cloke said: 'This set was always in
their home while they were married. 

'He wouldn't talk about his history but he
used to spend a lot of time researching the Second World War.'

The vendor's husband passed away
some years ago and she lost contact with his family so she still does not know
how he came to own the instruments.

Ms Cloke added: 'The father [of the vendor's husband] used to deal during the war in the black market so we don't
know whether they were in the camp and were able to take it or whether it came
through the black market somehow,' she said.

'It is something we are never going
to know.'

Theresienstadt, near what is now the town of Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000 dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as Auschwitz and murdered

Gillian
Walnes, executive director of the Anne Frank Trust UK

'Inexplicably there are those who
have a grotesque fascination with Nazi memorabilia and instruments used to
inflict suffering on innocent adults and children. 

'I
therefore hope that this item will be acquired by a respected museum or
academic institution that will use it for educational purposes.'

Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies

'There
is understandably a continuing fascination with this tragic part of our recent
history, and along with the countless books and films on the subject, from time
to time artefacts emerge that testify to the horrors of the Holocaust. 

'These things serve to remind us of the terrible events that happened, and
incontrovertibly show the claims of Holocaust deniers for the lies that they
are. 

'However, to seek to profit from such ghoulish objects, and to risk
that they might fall into the hands of admirers of the Nazis, is deeply
troubling. A more fitting home would be in a museum or suitable historical
archive somewhere.'

Karen Pollock, chief executive
of the Holocaust Educational Trust

'Wherever possible we believe
Holocaust-era items should be presented in an educational context, so that as
many people as possible can learn about what took place during that appalling
time.'

The camp, near what is now the town of
Terezin in the Czech Republic, acted as a ghetto for 140,000 Jews, with 33,000
dying there during the war and 88,000 taken from it to extermination camps such as
Auschwitz and murdered.

Just 1,900 were still alive when the
ghetto was liberated by Soviet troops on May 7, 1945.

Burger was ordered by SS leader Heinrich
Himmler and Adolf Eichmann, the orchestrator of the mass movement of Jews to camps
in Eastern Europe, to change the appearance of Theresienstadt to fool Red Cross
members who had requested access to a Nazi concentration camp.

Many inmates were temporarily removed from
the overcrowded camp and cosmetic changes made to fool the inspectors.

Fake shops and cafes were erected to give the
false impression that inmates had a life of relative comfort.

The Red Cross representatives seemed to
fall for the deception and the Nazis went on to make a propaganda film at the
camp.

The fact that the wooden instrument case
is marked 'instrumente gemischte', German for 'mixed
instruments', has led to the theory that this may have been made as part
of the deception, to suggest it was for musical instruments.

'Anton Burger was charged with
changing the appearance of the camp, and a lot of the Jews there were musical
so it is possible it was made to look like a musical instrument case,' Ms
Cloke said.

Austrian-born Burger was sentenced to
death after the war but fled and lived under an assumed name, eventually dying
in Germany in 1991 at the age of 80.

It was only three years after his death,
in 1994, that anyone found out who the dead man really was.

Ms Cloke said that the auction house was
aware of the sensitive nature of selling an item that once belonged to a Nazi
war criminal.

Museums and other institutions across the
world have already shown an interest in the sale and Ms Cloke said they hoped
it would go to an organisation that would be able to use it in a positive,
educational setting.

The collection is due to go on sale this Saturday.
