Alex Neil's post-match summary was as cutting as his impressive team had been in destroying and relegating a fragile Hibs.

After
 watching his goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert clinch promotion to the 
Premiership by saving a tame penalty by teenager Jason Cummings, the 
Hamilton Accies manager declared this famous and thrilling victory to be
 a triumph of hope over fear.

'Over the two legs, we were 
desperate to win and Hibs were terrified to lose,' said Neil. 'I can 
understand (the fear factor) because I've been relegated with Hamilton 
before but I just thought that was the difference between the two teams 
over the two legs – we were determined to win the game while Hibs looked
 terrified to lose.'

Neil's assessment was spot on. From the moment Jason Scotland capitalised on some typically miserable Hibs defending to put Accies into the lead, nervous tension spread across Easter Road, infecting players and fans alike. It had been exactly the same when Kris Boyd scored against the run of play to consign Hibs to the play-offs in the first place.

Yet, to focus solely on the deficiencies of Hibs would be to do Hamilton a major disservice. Neil's team were a credit to themselves and despite the sneers about their low following, from a footballing perspective on yesterday's evidence they will be a fine addition to the top flight. 

While Hibs were hopeless, and reliant on aimless hoofed balls forward, Neil's players admirably stuck to their passing principles.

Even three minutes into injury time, and needing a goal to level the tie, they refused to panic and passed the ball up the park until Jason Scotland's cut back was swept home by Frenchman Tony Andreu.  From first to last they left absolutely everything out on that pitch. And after 120 stamina sapping minutes, each player who strode forward to take a pressurised spot kick – Grant Gillespie, Andreu, Mickael Antoine-Curier and Scotland – showed no sign of fatigue.

On a day that the Edinburgh Marathon was also in town, it was a stunning feat of endurance by Hamilton, whose manager was one of the few not to fancy himself from the spot.  'When it went to penalties, I was thinking "Please, five guys put up your hands because I don't want the pressure",' Neil admitted. 'Thankfully we had six hands going up.

'I  asked which ones were not quite sure but they were all sure they 
would score. That was great for me. I wasn't taking the fifth one, no 
chance. Being player and manager and fifth penalty taker would have been
 too much for me. The goalie was on one before me.' 

Hibs had not won
 at home since February 15 and it's largely due to the kind of defending
 that saw them go behind yesterday. Ryan McGivern's slack ball out of 
defence was sent forward by Ali Crawford to Andreu, who played in 
Scotland.

The Trinidad international striker spun the awful 
Michael Nelson quite beautifully before smacking a ferocious low shot 
goalwards from the edge of the box. The ball hit Ben Williams and 
bounced up into the back of the net for Scotland's ninth goal of the 
season. It was game on and rather appropriately the heavens above Leith 
opened to spit their fury on the Hibs players.

The biggest 
reflection of the crisis of confidence in the home ranks came when Paul 
Heffernan ran clear on goal, only to hit a shot that was so poor and so 
lacking in power that it failed to go out for a throw in. Accies, 
meanwhile, were zipping the ball confidently about the Easter Road turf 
as if it were their own manor.

As 17,000 Hibees held their breath, 
at the other end it took a good save with his feet to stop Louis 
Longridge making it 2-2 on aggregate. A good Alan Maybury block stopped 
Longridge pulling the trigger minutes later after fine build-up work. 

'Going down with the Jambos' came the prescient cry from Accies fans, sensing blood.

Decisive strike: Jason Cummings missed penalty meant Hibernian's 15-year Scottish top flight stay is over

Saved: Kevin Thomson also saw his penalty stopped as Hibernian lost 4-3 in the shootout at Easter Road

Man of the moment: Hamilton goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert saved two penalties in the play-off shootout

Hibs
 were truly pitiful and by the half hour mark their fans were jeering 
each misplaced pass, of which there were many. Their well-remunerated 
players were being given the run around by Longridge, signed from junior
 outfit Bo'ness United, and outfought by Darian MacKinnon, plucked from 
non-league Clydebank.

Cummings did have a header kicked off the 
line by Routledge but it was Hibs' only threat all afternoon and Andreu 
hit the side netting just before the break. In the second half, Williams
 saved to stop Scotland levelling the tie on aggregate.

As Accies
 chased the second, McGivern could have seen red for fouling Scotland as
 he burst through on goal. Accies boss Neil then sent on Antoine-Curier,
 Andy Ryan and himself but in rain of almost biblical proportions, it 
looked like Hibs had weathered the storm. 

Still, there was a strange
 sense of inevitability when, with just 75 seconds remaining, Scotland 
set up Andreu to take the tie into extra time. The final 30 minutes saw 
two big and correct calls by referee Willie Collum, refusing to award 
Hibs a penalty for a foul on Craig then booking Ryan for diving at the 
other end 30 seconds later.

And so to penalties. Up stepped Kevin
 Thomson, whose poor kick was save. The former Rangers and Scotland star
 had chosen the wrong day to declare in the newspapers that Hibs won't 
find a better midfielder than him.

With Accies scoring with ease,
 the final kick fell to Cummings. He of the self-proclaimed left-foot 
that could 'open a tin of beans' failed and Hibs were sent down. The 
mood turned poisonous around Easter Road. 

For Accies, though, this was a famous and deserved victory. And for Neil, it was one he had foretold.

'I
 think people in general had written us off but I always believed we 
would win,' he smiled. 'I just had a feeling. I don't know what it was. I
 was actually going to play myself from the start but then I got that 
feeling and took myself out of the team again. 

'I changed it about 
and to a man we were unbelievable. The effort we put in was incredible. 
I'm pleased for the players. They've put in so much this season and I 
felt we should have won the Championship.

'We didn't, Dundee did, and that was difficult to accept.

'But
 I heard (English striker) Kevin Phillips saying recently the best way 
to go up is through the playoffs. Now that we've done it I know what he 
meant. It' s incredible.'
