A rancher involved in a tense stand off with federal agents has warned that he will never back down down from his fight.

Cliven Bundy said he expects officials with the Bureau of Land Management to make another attempt to seize his cattle.

'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline.

'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.'

He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada.

He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.'

Bundy, 67, won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada.

Fears of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call off their operation on Saturday.

Supporters of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at any moment.

Many of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared to take on the federal agents in a fire fight.

One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down.'

With the threat of violence so close federal officials took the decision to pull out their agents and return the estimated 300 cattle they had rounded up back to Bundy.

The move diffused the situation, but on Sunday more than 100 people were still at a roadside command center where a banner read: 'The West has now been won.'

An emotional Bundy thanked a small crowd of 50 people who sat in blustery conditions with desert sand swirling around the small encampment.

Bundy, a Mormon father of 14, said he had been 'humbled' by so much support.

'What we did was necessary but we are just at the begriming. This fight will go on.'

Around him banners proclaiming hatred towards the Federal Government flapped wildly in the wind.

The noise from flapping flags was often so loud in drowned out the procession of speakers who came to pledge their support to 'fight for freedom.'

One banner read: 'Putin took Ukraine. Obama couldn't be outdone, so he had to take Nevada.'

Others had quotes from the US constitution and warnings for the Government not to interfere with the rights of people.

One car parked at the site had a warning that anyone born after 1980 could have had a chip implanted in their body by the US Government.

Almost all of those attendance at the open air prayer service were armed.

Despite not a single police officer being present when Bundy got up to speak he was flanked by two armed bodyguards.

When MailOnline attempted to reach Bundy's ranch they were stopped by four heavily armed members of a militia.

One carried an AR-15 rifle with telescopic sight and a hunting knife strapped to his chest.

Others in full camouflage clothing patrolled the road seemingly on the alert for an unseen enemy.

Asked why Bundy needed armed bodyguards, a militia member said brusquely: 'The Government are out to get him. We do not know what they are capable off.'

When it was pointed out that all federal agents had left the area 24 hours ago he replied: 'They could be spying on us from a drone.'

At the prayer service members of a so called 'Anonymous Security' milled around.

Their faces were obscured by masks taken from the film V- for Vendetta. Others wore T-shirts with the words: 'Tyranny Response Team.'

As Bundy left the service a procession of people lined up to shake his hand and thank him.

One woman with tears in her eyes hugged Bundy and said: 'It is a privilege for me to be here.'

Most of those who had turned out in support of Bundy appeared to be from Arizona. Others had traveled from Montana and Utah.

Among them were several politicians, including state representative David Livingstone.

He said: 'Make no mistake this is just the beginning. This is not about Mr Bundy and his cattle but about the Federal Government and their land grab.

'For many people this was the tipping point. The Government will be back here in two weeks and so will be. This issue is not going away.'

Mr Livingstone, who represents Peoria, Arizona, said he estimated the cost of the Bureau of Land Management round up operation to have cost between $2m and $5m.

'That is just ludicrous,. They say Mr Bundy owes $1m yet they have just spend almost five times that in a failed operation to seize his cattle.

'Where is the sense in that. It is just federal government wasting more of the taxpayers money.'

Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years

The dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave Desert tortoise.

Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years.

The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle.

Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support.

Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy.

It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2m he owes to the Government.

The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region.

The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals.

The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.
