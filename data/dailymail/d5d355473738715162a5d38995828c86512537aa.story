Concern: New figures reveal a one-year-old baby was among more than 5,000 children in Wales to have been swabbed for DNA over the last three years

A one-year-old baby is among thousands of children who have had their DNA taken by police, it was revealed last night.

The baby is believed to be among the youngest ever to undergo the procedure as part of a criminal inquiry.

New figures revealed he was among more than 5,000 children in Wales to have been swabbed for DNA over the last three years.

They mirror the activities of police across the rest of the nation who insist they follow the law on the taking and retention of personal samples.

Campaigners are growing increasingly concerned that young people could be traumatised by the experience and left on police databases for life.

Helen Wallace, who leads Genewatch, said she fears the taking of a child’s DNA is not always necessary or proportionate.

‘The police do need to be able to take samples from children in cases sometimes to eliminate samples,’ she said.

‘So a one-year-old would have been present in a house where a crime has taken place and they will need that data.

'But our concern is about the large numbers of children who are ending up with records on the DNA database.

‘The process a child can go through can be quite traumatic if a child is arrested for no reason, if it is a false accusation or misunderstanding.

‘It can be traumatic to be photographed and fingerprinted and have your DNA taken.’ 

The latest figures revealed 5,561 children were swabbed by the four forces in Wales as part of their investigations since 2010.

South Wales Police took the most, 2,866 samples, but Dyfed-Powys Police, which took 1,080 samples, swabbed the youngest children.

The latest figures revealed a staggering 5,561 children were swabbed by the four forces in Wales as part of their investigations since 2010

Among them were the one-year-old, a two-year-old in 2010, a seven-year-old in 2011, an eight-year-old in 2012 and a nine-year-old in 2011.

A total of 1,132 children have been swabbed by North Wales Police since 2010. The youngest was 10. Since 2010 they have taken 16 samples of kids that age.

This year Gwent Police took 120 samples from under 15s. The youngest was ten. Since 2010 they have sampled 483.

The Protection of Freedoms Act, due to be introduced soon, will mean the DNA of children can be removed from databases if they are innocent or only convicted of a minor offence.

Under current legislation, police retain DNA samples taken with consent if they could be used in court proceedings, including any possible appeal.

Nick Pickles, of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘I’m stunned that someone thought it was acceptable to take a DNA sample from a one-year-old baby. On what possible grounds is that reasonable or necessary?

The UK DNA Database has grown to become the largest in the world and yet there is little evidence to suggest DNA profiling results in a higher sense of public safety.’ 

Andrew Neilson runs the Howard League for Penal Reform. He said: ‘These figures show the worrying extent to which children are drawn into criminal investigations.

‘It is a cause for concern that more than 5,500 DNA samples have been taken from under-16s in only three and a half years.’ 

Dyfed-Powys Police said: ‘A total of five DNA samples were taken from children between the ages of zero and nine.

‘These were volunteer DNA elimination samples which were required in order to assist in the investigation of crimes.'

Earlier this year, it emerged that police in England Wales collect a DNA sample from a child every ten minutes.

Officers took nearly 54,000 swabs of genetic material from under 18s in 2012.

On average, 27 primary school children had their DNA taken by the police every week to put on the national database.

Figures obtained using the Freedom of Information Act revealed 53,974 DNA samples were taken from children during 2011.

Police in England and Wales collected samples from 368 ten-year-olds and 1,030 11-year-olds.

The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said: ‘DNA may be taken from children in a number of circumstances. The taking and retention of DNA from people of all ages is set out clearly under law.’
