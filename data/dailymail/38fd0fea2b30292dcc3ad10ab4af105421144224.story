Arrested: Cynthia Watson, 51, was arrested Monday after accidentally giving her 2-year-old granddaughter a cup of tea laced with methamphetamine

A 51-year-old woman was arrested Monday after accidentally giving her 2-year-old granddaughter a cup of tea spiked with methamphetamine. 

Cynthia Ann Watson of Aloha, Oregon was visiting family near Hemet, California Sunday night when she made a cup of tea laced with the drug 'to get herself high'. 

However, the drink was left unattended and the toddler ended up drinking some of it.

The young girl's mother sought help Monday morning because her daughter 'was talking rapidly, scratching her skin, could not sit still and was very agitated,' a Sheriff's department statement read.

'Thinking there might be some medical issue with her daughter, the reporting party took her to a local hospital to be examined.'

Doctors ran tests on the little girl and found traces of methamphetamine in her system.

The toddler was later released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

Watson was arrested at the family's home on the 31000 block of Pine Street and is being held in lieu of $35,000 bail on charges of felony child endangerment and possession of methamphetamine.

She is being held at the Larry D Smith Correctional Facility in Banning and is expected to appear in court for the first time Monday morning at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta.
