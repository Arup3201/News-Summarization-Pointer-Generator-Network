Leanne Wertheim, 24, was caught running the highly-profitable make-up scam from her bedroom

A woman who sold toxic imitations of well-known make-up brands online has been spared jail.

Leanne Wertheim used four separate eBay accounts to sell £40,000 worth of fake products – including copies of Max Factor and Bobbi Brown – to unsuspecting customers.

The 24-year-old posted out the poisonous Chinese-made copies from her bedroom.

Some, which she claimed were from high-end companies such as MAC, Benefit and Lancome, contained three times the legal amount of lead, which can cause brain damage.

Wertheim, a mother-of-one, offered online buyers what seemed like amazing bargains, claiming to sell products worth up to £30 on the high street for as little as £3.99.

But in reality the care worker had bought the fake make-up from China on the internet. When buyers complained about the quality, she insisted the items were authentic, Cardiff Crown Court was told.

After a complaint, Trading Standards investigators posed as customers to buy the make-up from Wertheim.

Tests on the imitation cosmetics revealed they contained more than three times the legal amount of lead, a metal linked to side-effects including brain damage, a lowering of IQ in unborn babies and behaviour problems. 

One, a counterfeit Max Factor mascara, was found to contain 68mg/kg of lead, the legal level being 20mg/kg.

Prosecutor Lee Reynolds said: 
‘[Wertheim] was running large eBay accounts selling make-up. When test 
purchases were carried out [the] mascara and foundation were found to be
fakes.’

Officers then raided her house and 
found unsold items waiting to be put on the internet. By the time 
Trading Standards closed down her scheme, Wertheim, from Gilwern in 
Monmouthshire, south Wales, had sold £25,000 of fake make-up, with 
£15,000 worth waiting to be sold.

Online shoppers offer an easy market for cosmetic fraudsters.

There is a ‘big trade in fakes’ as criminals seek to cash in on the popularity of leading brands.But for customers tempted by the cheaper prices and convenience of shopping online, there are some golden rules to follow to avoid being ripped off.

The consumer website spotcounterfeits.co.uk advises:  ‘Know the products before you shop. Check them out in a reputable store, look closely at the names and packaging.’

The site warns shoppers buying Chanel cosmetics online to be aware the genuine items ‘invariably come only in black cases’ and always carry the ‘simple Chanel double C’ logo.

It warns fans of MAC make-up that ‘real items have the barcode as a sticker on the box, as well as having the colour name and finish on a sticker on the top of the box’.

She admitted five charges under the 
Trades Mark Act 1994, claiming she was ‘more naive than calculated’ and 
didn’t realise what she was selling was fake.

But Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told 
her: ‘I don’t think you are naive, I think you set up to deliberately 
make money from customers, many of whom were very gullible.

‘You assured them the items were 
authentic, furthering your deceit, and you opened extra eBay accounts to
cover your tracks.

'You sold items for £3.99 which would have sold [for]
between £20 and £30 on the high street.

‘These genuine businesses can expect the courts to deal with people who exploit customers.’

As for online customers, he warned, they ‘would do well to remember the 
saying if something is sold at a price that seems too good to be true, 
it probably is’.

Wertheim was given an eight-month 
suspended prison sentence, told to carry out 160 hours’ community 
service and pay costs of £2,000.

She has already spent most of the money
she earned through the scam so there will be no proceeds of crime 
hearing. The remaining make-up will be destroyed.

The court did not hear whether her 
customers received refunds. However eBay users who pay via PayPal are 
covered by the eBay Buyer Protection scheme, under which they can apply 
for refunds.

An eBay spokesman added: ‘eBay does not allow the sale of counterfeit 
goods. We have an established programme... to remove items from sale 
that cause concern.’

£15,000 worth of fake make-up and cosmetics were seized from Leanne Wertheim's home
