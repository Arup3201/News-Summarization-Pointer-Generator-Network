President Obama has refrained from picking favorites in the race to succeed him and paid Vice President Biden a strong compliment without issuing anything close to an endorsement.

‘I've got somebody who I think will go down as one of the finest vice presidents in history, and he has been, as I said earlier, a great partner in everything that I do,’ Obama said in an interview with CBS released Thursday.

The President will continue to walk a proverbial tightrope for the near future as all eyes are cast on Hillary Clinton, waiting to see if the former Secretary of State decides to formally announce her second presidential bid.

Looking for the handoff: Vice President Joe Biden has not decided whether or not he will run for President in 2016 but Obama has refused to take the normal move of endorsing his number two (pictured together on Wednesday)

‘I suspect that there may be other potential candidates for 2016 who have been great friends and allies. I know that we've got an extraordinary Secretary of State who did great service for us and worked with me and Joe to help make the country safer,’ Obama said.

‘Whoever the Democratic standard bearer is going to be continuing to focus on jobs, making sure that our kids our getting a great education, making sure that we're rebuilding prosperity from the middle class out in country, and I am very much interested in making sure that some of the stuff we've gotten started continues.’

Clinton is widely seen as the Democratic frontrunner in 2016 and has been trouncing Biden in both the early polls and early fundraising efforts.

In spite of Clinton’s hefty lead- the latest Fox News poll completed Tuesday has Clinton beating Biden by 53 per cent in the race for the Democratic nomination- has not deterred Biden from keeping the door open for his third presidential run.

He has repeatedly said that he has not decided on his 2016 prospects, rotating his answers between saying that he will decide after the midterms, he hasn’t been focusing on it, or leaving the final decision to his wife Jill.

‘There is nothing I would do differently if I absolutely knew I wasn't going to run or I absolutely knew I was,’ Biden said most recently.

The President’s decision to hedge his bets in the CBS interview does not come as a massive surprise to political analysts, as this is just the latest in a string of signs that he is staying close with Clinton even after she left his administration.

One of the most telling moments came shortly after he was sworn into office for a second term, when he chose to have Clinton by his side for the first televised interview of the term rather than his running mate, Biden.

According to a lengthy Politico profile of 'Scranton Joe' that ran in February, trouble began brewing during the 2012 re-election campaign as there were rumors that the Obama team was considering replacing Biden with then-outgoing-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

When questioned about it by Biden, all involved parties denied any truth to said rumor and said so publicly, but not as forcefully as Biden wanted.

Not only were they not being as strong in their denials as Biden wanted, they were also lying. There was some truth to the speculation as pollsters from the campaign had begun slipping in questions about what the public would think if Clinton was brought in as number two.

For her part, Clinton has not done anything to tamper the mounting speculation, launching a speaking tour and repeating how she hopes that- while she hasn’t decided what her next formal role witll be- there will be a female president within her lifetime.
