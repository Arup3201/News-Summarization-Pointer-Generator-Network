A man who lost everything in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan and claimed over 15,000 lives, is finally getting back one of his prized possessions - his jet ski.

Tomo­mune Matsu­naga, who lived in Fuku­shima, lost his home and almost all of his personal possessions back on March 11, 2011, including, he assumed, his yellow Yamaha personal watercraft.

Then,  in May of this year, a young intern for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Danielle Lampe, found the craft while doing research on the Johnston Atoll, roughly 700 miles southwest of Hono­lulu.

Good find: A man who lost his jet ski (above) in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated Japan is getting it back after it washed ashore in Hawaii

Long journey: The craft traveled approximately 3,300 miles, from Fukushima, Japan to the Johnston Atoll in Hawaii

The craft, while badly damaged and no longer in working condition, had traveled approximately 3,300 miles.

Lampe was conducting a bird survey back on May 21 when she discovered the jet ski. 

'He's lost everything,' Lampe, 23, said of the craft's owner while speaking with the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.

'Getting something back, even if it can't be used, means a lot.'  

And now, thanks to some help from Chris Woolaway, the Hawaii coordinator for a global event called International Coastal Cleanup, Matsunaga is getting his jet ski back free of charge.

Woolaway called on a friend who reached out to the captain of a Japanese boat, the Fuku­shima Maru, that docks in Honolulu three times a year.

Heading home: The jet ski was transported back to Honolulu (above) in May, and this Sunday put on a boat to return to Japan

Devastation: The craft's owner, Tomo­mune Matsu­naga, lost his home and most of his personal possessions as a result of the natural disaster (above), which occurred on March 11, 2011

The captain, Shigeki Kuwabara, agreed to transport the jet ski and, on Sunday, when the boat left Honolulu for Japan, the craft was hoisted aboard, set to reunite with its owner on November 11 after another long trip across then Pacific Ocean.

There is no word yet on what Matsu­naga, who lives in temporary housing in Iwaki City, plans to do with his craft when he gets it back.
