The Jaguar E-Type has been voted the greatest car of all time - and is one of eight British cars to feature in the top ten.

New research revealed the E-Type, launched in 1961, is the most iconic car ever, topping a top ten list including the Mini, Rolls Royces and the VW Beetle.

Aston Martin also had four cars in the top ten - the DB5, the DB9, the V8 Vanquish and the Vanquish.

Most iconic car ever: The classic E-Type Jaguar, which was manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd between 1961 and 1975

The research, by Discovery Channel's motoring series Wheeler Dealers, marks its new season, when it will feature its 100th car on the show.

When asked to choose the best cars of all time, 32 per cent of Brits said the E-Type, with one in five opting for the Mini and 18 per cent the Porsche 911 - making up the top three.

From a list of 100 classical cars spanning the decades, the Porsche 911 and the VW Beetle were the only non-British cars in the top ten.

Meanwhile, the highest ranked Italian car was the Ferrari F40 which came in 11th place, a poll of 2,000 British drivers found.

Ford had four inclusions in the top 25, headed by the Ford Capri (17th), Ford Mustang (19th) and Ford Cortina Mk 3 (20th).

Mike Brewer, the show's car trading expert, said: 'This underlines the incredible heritage of British car manufacturing, where originality, style and performance have been the hallmarks of many of our greatest cars.

'As the classic car market continues to boom, we're seeing many popular productions being snapped up as future classics.'

The German Volkswagen saw the Beetle - made famous through the 'Herbie Goes' films - ranked above the highest placed Mercedes or BMW models.

Indeed, the high performance sports grand tourer Mercedes SLR McLaren was in 44th place and the BMW 3 Series in 61st.

Of the four French models in the 100-strong list, the Renault 5 Clio Williams (58th) pipped the Peugeot 205 GTI (63rd).

The Jaguar E-Type topped two other polls, with the Roadster version being voted the greatest ever convertible and the E-Type named the best classic car of all time.

Wheeler Dealers has seen presenters Mike Brewer and Edd China transform many run down classics into sleek and gleaming beauties.

Edd said: 'It's good to see the Capri and the XR3i now joining the pantheon of classic popular production cars.

'As we unveil our 100th car in the series, we'll be aiming to return another hidden gem to its former glory.'
