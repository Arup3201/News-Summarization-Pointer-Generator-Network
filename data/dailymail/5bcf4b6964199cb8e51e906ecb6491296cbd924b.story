Thierry Henry says he wants to manage Arsenal one day. He talks of getting his badges and qualifications. In the meantime, he is working for Sky.

‘I have to be able to make sure I have everything on board to be able to go back,’ he says.

What, a nice set of exams? Why would Arsenal appoint a novice to steer them through the difficult task of succeeding Arsene Wenger?

Thierry Henry may be an Arsenal legend but he needs to prove himself as a manager, not a pundit

By joining Sky, while doing his coaching badges, Henry has weakened his chances of managing his old club

Arsene Wenger signed the French forward in 1999, but it seems unlikely he will be replaced by Henry

We saw what happened at Manchester United when Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down and what was needed to replace him: one of Europe’s most experienced elite coaches, Louis van Gaal.

How can Henry prove Arsenal-worthy from his Sky studio? Jamie Carragher talks a good game, too — but the guys at Fenway are not about to ditch Brendan Rodgers for him, no matter how many badges he has. Ultimately, the test is to get out there and do it — at academy level, youth level, in the lower leagues, as an assistant.

A former Highbury hero, Patrick Vieira, is doing just this at Manchester City, and if Henry was genuinely on the road to being Arsenal manager, his first appearance before the Sky cameras would involve having a microphone poked up his nose by Geoff Shreeves.
