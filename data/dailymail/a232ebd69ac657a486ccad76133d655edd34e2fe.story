Rupert Murdoch has claimed all Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of jihadists

Rupert Murdoch has sparked outrage after saying all Muslims should be held responsible for the actions of jihadists. 

The controversial media mogul took to Twitter after three days of terrorist atrocities in Paris.

The News Corp boss suggested that even peaceful Muslims must take responsibility for the actions of terrorists until the 'jihadist cancer' is destroyed.

He wrote: 'Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.' 

He then maintained his stance, telling more than 500,000 followers that 'political correctness' made for 'denial and hypocrisy'. 

He added: 'Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US.

'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy.'

His words sparked a storm on the social network, with many Muslim users outraged as Murdoch appeared to lay the blame for the terrorist attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket on an entire religion, which has more than a billion followers. 

One user blasted his sweeping generalisation, and said: '"they" as in most Muslims????? You can't hold an entire religion of billions responsive [sic] for the actions of a few' 

Erwin Renaldi said: 'I'm really sad reading this. Insulting my faith and I have nothing to do with the extremists and I can do nothing.'

Simon Edhouse added: 'Rupert, is West responsible for our extremists, Anders Breivik? etc' 

Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling condemned Murdoch's comments, writing: 'I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate.' 

She then added: 'The Spanish Inquisition was my fault, as is all Christian fundamentalist violence. Oh, and Jim Bakker.'

Bakker is a disgraced pastor and televangelist who resigned amid a sex scandal, and later served five years of an original 45-year prison sentence for fraud and conspiracy, after stealing millions from charitable donations.  

Others questioned Murdoch's own morals, and referred to the phone-hacking scandal at the now-defunct News of the World newspaper.

Michael Monan replied: '@rupertmurdoch In the same way that you must be held responsible for ordering the hacking of the voicemails of dead school children?'

Murdoch's words also prompted ridicule - with white men, journalists, Australians and men called Rupert apologising on his behalf. 

The creator of BBC sitcom Citizen Khan, Adil Ray, who said: 'I think all of Australia should be held responsible for Rupert Murdoch.' 

Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch thinks all Muslims should apologise for terrorism. So on behalf of white people I'd like to apologise for Rupert Murdoch.' 

Richard Robbins said: 'Am I to be held responsible for the rantings of octogenarian media moguls because we're both Caucasian?' 

Another user joked: 'Maybe most Ruperts peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy cancerous media dinosaur @rupertmurdoch, they must be held responsible.'

To which, Rupert Franklin replied: 'I'd like to offer an apology on behalf of us all. Murdoch's comments don't represent the views of mainstream Rupert community.' 

And Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch wrote a tweet. As someone who uses Twitter I would like to apologise on his behalf.'
