With the Baftas taking place this Sunday, we’re all looking forward to seeing the stars in their finery on the red carpet.

Everyone always talks about the dresses, but no one sees the hard work that goes into creating the make-up and hairstyles that provide the sparkling finishing touches.

Shehla Shaikh, head make-up artist for Lancome, has worked with countless celebrities, including Sienna Miller, Rosamund Pike and Brenda Blethyn.

As a celebration of Sunday’s ceremony, Shehla met readers Annie Poulter, 54, a nursing home administrator, and her daughter Rachel, 24, a vascular nurse.

With a big family anniversary coming up, they were thrilled at the chance of a makeover to suit the red carpet.

Annie is a lipstick lover, but doesn’t normally wear foundation as she prefers to go barefaced. She sometimes wears brown sparkly eyeshadow and mascara for a special occasions.

Rachel, meanwhile, doesn’t usually wear make-up — only moisturiser — because she has dry skin. Her favourite cream is Waitrose’s Baby Bottom Butter (£3.09, waitrose.com).

EXPERT TIPS FOR ANNIE

Choose matte shades in flattering tones such as taupe, brown, bronze or khaki to give a smokey eye. Use the medium tone all around the eyes to frame, and add definition into the lash line by smudging it with kohl pencil.

For Annie, Shehla recommended Maybelline's Lash Sensational to define your eyes

Try Lancome Hypnose Star Eyes Palette, ST7 (£37, boots.com). A good budget alternative is the new Collection Eyes Uncovered Palette in Nude Bronze (£3.99, superdrug.com).

Emphasise the eyes with mascara — take time to get perfect lashes rather than rushing this, as it gives a lift to the eye.

It’s best to avoid messy, glittery eyeshadow, as it falls down into fine lines on your face.

Also, steer clear of black — use it only to define inside the water line or with your mascara.

Try Lancome Grandiose (£23.50, lancome.co.uk) or the new Maybelline Lash Sensational (£7.99, boots.com).

Keep your lips and cheeks neutral, but warm with rosy pink shades. Teaming a warm nude lip with rosy pink cheeks is brightening for the face. Lancome Rouge In Love 240m (£21.50, lancome.co.uk) is perfect.

The Lancome Blush Subtil Palette (£28.50, lancome.co.uk) is also a good multi-tasker, as it can be used for eyes as well as contouring and highlighting your cheeks.

EXPERT TIPS FOR RACHEL

For Rachel, Shehla recommended L’Oreal Paris Infallible 24H Lip Colour in Red Infallible for a bold lip colour

When you are in your 20s or 30s the rulebook is there to be broken — why not try a bold lip and eye?

For subtle glamour, don’t over-do the cheeks. Lancome Limited Edition BAFTA L’Absolu Rouge 160 (£23.50, lancome.co.uk) is a perfect red-carpet choice.

Or try L’Oreal Paris Infallible 24H Lip Colour in Red Infallible (£9.99, boots.com). It’s important to use the right brushes, but it’s imperative to make sure you have the right products, such as primer for the skin. Use a primer underneath your foundation to give you an understated dewy finish.

Disguise any dark circles by applying concealer in a triangle formation. This will reflect the light and lift your eyes.

The new Lancome Miracle Cushion Foundation (£29.50, lancome.co.uk) is great to use when you are trying to do your base in a rush, as you can dab it on to problem areas when you’re on the go.

Opt for a taupe matte or peachy bronze eyeshadow, and smudge a waterproof kohl pencil into the lash line. Try Bourjois waterproof Color Band Eyeshadow crayon (£5.99, boots.com) in Beige Minimaliste.

THE VERDICT

After: both Annie (left) and Rachel (right) were over the moon with their transformations

Annie says: ‘It’s amazing! I will definitely start to use browns and coral. I often wear blue and grey — but these shades have made my skin look radiant, without looking too sparkly. I love the warm pink lipstick too.'

Rachel says: ‘Nobody will recognise me! I love it. I have tried to wear red lips, but they never look this good.’
