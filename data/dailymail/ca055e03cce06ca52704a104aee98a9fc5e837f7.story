'It is clear the IRS cannot operate with even a shred of the American peopleÂ¿s confidence under the current leadership,' Rubio wrote to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew

Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio demanded the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven T. Miller on Monday, as President Barack Obama seemed to apologize for the tax agency's targeting of Tea Party organizations and other right-wing groups for special scrutiny before granting them tax-exempt nonprofit status.

Americans, Obama said, are 'properly concerned' about what, if true, would be 'outrageous' IRS conduct, and said the bureaucrats responsible would be 'held accountable.'

'You don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased, and anything less than neutral, in terms of how they operate,' Obama said during a White House press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron.

'I've got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we will make sure we find out exactly what happened on this,' he told reporters.

In a letter to Treasury Secretary 
Jack Lew, however, Rubio upped the ante and raised the possibility of 
criminal charges being brought against IRS personnel who probed tea 
party groups that applied for the right to promise tax deductions to 
their financial contributors, or for the right to lobby on a not-for-profit basis.

'The
American people deserve answers about how such seemingly 
unconstitutional and potentially criminal behavior could occur, and who 
else was aware of it throughout the Administration,' Rubio wrote.

'If
investigations reveal that bureaucrats or political appointees engaged 
in unconstitutional or criminal targeting of conservative taxpayers, 
they must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'

Obama was faced with questions about the performance of his administration's IRS on Monday, allowing that targeting groups for their political views was 'outrageous'

Rubio wants a scalp from Acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller (L). A source told MailOnline that Lois Lerner, Director of Exempt Organizations for the IRS, is under investigation.

Alan P. Dye, an attorney in 
Washington, D.C. who represents nonprofit clients in tax proceedings 
with the IRS, told MailOnline that at least six of his clients have been
caught in a 'ridiculous' situation that has delayed their applications 
for as long as 30 months.

'They're very pissed off,' he said, 'and they have every right to be pissed off.'

Dye, a partner with the firm of Webster, Chamberlain & Bean and a member of the Committee on Exempt Organizations of the Section of Taxation of the American Bar Association, called the situation 'clearly more than just bureaucratic idiocy.'

'Someone made a decision that certain groups should be subject to special scrutiny because of their political views,' Dye alleged, 'The IRS actually has a manual that they are supposed to follow, that says you can't do this.'

Dye was referring to questions his clients received from the IRS, after they filed applications for tax exempt status, which demanded the names and contributions amounts of all their financial donors.

'Congress has already decided, in the Internal Revenue Code, that donors shouldn't be disclosed to anyone except for the IRS,' he told MailOnline, 'but everything these groups tell the IRS is open to public inspection once their exempt status is granted.'

Tea party protesters demonstrated in 2012 against the US Supreme Court's ruling upholding the constitutionality of Obamacare. Dozens of individual organizations have complained that the IRS treated them differently from liberal or politically neutral groups

Hundreds of small protests, like this one involving The Tea Party Immigration Coalition, have cropped up in 2013 in opposition to the president's immigration reform package - a topic on which Rubio has himself been an approving leader in the Senate

'With respect to donors, they should 
never ask that question. When they ask me for that information, I tell 
them they're not getting it. The donors have a right to privacy.'

'Regardless of who's in the White House,' he added, 'I find it personally offensive that anyone in the IRS would do this.'

Granting or rejecting tax-exempt status to a nonprofit group should take no more than nine months, Dye said. When the IRS discovered in June 2011 that it was applying a special standard to right-wing groups, he explained, the agency failed to address problems with applications that were already in process.

That has left some groups waiting for more than two years.

Rubio wrote to Lew that those in the IRS who targeted conservative organizations 'have committed a violation of the public trust that has already had a profoundly chilling effect on free speech. Such behavior cannot be excused with a simple apology.'

A Treasury Department source with knowledge of internal matters at the IRS told MailOnline that Lois Lerner, director of exempt organizations for the IRS, is under investigation by the agency's Office of Inspector General.

Dye called Lerner 'a relatively low-level person.' She did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Washington, D.C. nonprofit attorney Alan P. Dye (L) said his tea party clients are 'pissed off' at the IRS for making tax decisions according to politics, not by the law

Rubio's spokesman said the senator was traveling and did not have an immediate respond to a questions about whether the senator would accept Lerner's resignation as a sufficient government response to the scandal, which first broke Friday.

ABC News has published online a draft timeline that the Office of Inspector General released to selected media outlets. It shows that the IRS began targeting conservative groups for a special level of investigative scrutiny in early 2010.

Tea party organizations played a major role in the 2010 midterm congressional elections, turning the tide of dozens of House races and a few Senate contests toward Republicans, and assisting the GOP with ousting Democratic then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in favor of Ohio Republican John Boehner.

Yet Obama said Monday that 'if, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that's outrageous and there's no place for it.'

'And they have to be held fully accountable,' the president added, 'because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity.'

'And you should feel that way regardless of party. I don't care whether you're a Democrat, independent or a Republican. At some point, there are going to be Republican administrations. At some point, there are going to be Democratic ones. Either way, you don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased and anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate.'
