It's rare that one experiences such beauty - but Prince Charles had a double whammy at Buckingham Palace last night. 

The Royal College Of Music president hosted a concert at Buckingham Palace and after being entranced by soprano and cellist Taryn Fiebig's performance, he almost seemed to be moved to tears as they talked in person. 

The Australian musician looked stunning in a tight-fitting green satin dress with a sheer lace shrug, fastened at the neck with a pearl collar.

The prince, who is the president of the Royal College of Music, attended a joint concert by young members of Opera Australia and the RCM in a grand hall in Buckingham Palace.

He also hosted a reception for the Australian singers and supporters at the Palace. 

Wearing pristine black tie with a spotted pocket square, Charles laughed and joked with guests including the orchestra's conductor and Australian soprano Kiandra Howarth, who looked stunning in a belted red V-neck dress.

The talented young opera singers  earned rave reviews from Prince Charles after a 'once in a lifetime' performance in the historic Buckingham Palace ballroom. 

He was joined by 200 other guests and watched three stirring performances from  Taryn Fiebig, including her rendition of Song To The Moon from Rusulka in which a cello he formerly owned and played in the 1960s was played.

After the concert, he said: 'I must say, having heard my own cello played after such a long interval ... I have never seen somebody play the cello and sing so divinely at the same time.

'It's not fair really. It was a most astonishing performance.

'I think [tonight] makes all of us hugely proud of the immense talent Australia has in music and opera singing and so many other things.'

Ms Fiebig, who flew from Sydney for the concert, has a wealth of experience, including more than 200 shows on a national tour as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady.

Of her royal performance, she said: 'To sing in such a prestigious place is once in a lifetime really,' of the  ballroom, which was built in 1856 in the reign of Queen Victoria.

'There's something about the history of it and the grandeur of it and singing for a future king, it's amazing.'

As president of the Royal College of Music, he presents the recital from Australia's finest musical talent

Charles  attended Opera Australia's 50th anniversary Gala Recital in 2006 and visited the Sydney Opera House during a tour of Australia in 2012.

He has been president of the RCM for more than two decades.

'I promise you, nothing could give me greater pleasure than to (support) this because I am one of those people who so admires the talent of young people,' he said.

Charles attended without the Duchess of Cornwall.

While Prince Charles has highbrow taste in music and adores Bach and Hubert Parry, he also once revealed that he thought Leonard Cohen was 'wonderful' and as a bachelor he famously danced on stage with the Three Degrees.

He and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, regularly attend theatre and opera performances and symphony concerts. 

Earlier in the day, Charles attended the UK's largest Jain temple in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Institute of Jainology.

Charles wore a navy blue suit with a patterned tie to the religious event in Potters Bar, Herts.,

He opened the refurbished Assembly Halls of the Oshwal Association of the UK, where he was presented with a special Ahimsa Award by the Institute of Jainology.

In his speech yesterday the Prince appealed for religious tolerance and said jihadists had 'monstrously distorted' the message of their faith.

He praised the ancient Indian religion which preaches 'ahimsa' or non-violence towards all living beings 

Charles, who was given a garland on his arrival at the temple in Potters Bar, Herts, praised the ancient Indian religion for its belief in non- violence and compassion.

He added: 'At a time when horrific violence is being inflicted upon so many innocent people, it is of even greater importance to appeal for greater understanding between those of different faiths or of none at all.'

Jainism is an Indian religion that  and practitioners believe that peace and self-control will help them achieve liberation.

It is one of the oldest religions in the world and is a minority faith in India with only 4.2million adherents.
