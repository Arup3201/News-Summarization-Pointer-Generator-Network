Hillary Clinton made an unexpected visit to The Colbert Report on Tuesday night for a name-dropping contest with show host Stephen Colbert.

After Colbert did a bit about her recently released book Hard Choices being '656 pages of shameless name-dropping,' the former Secretary of State made a 'surprise' visit to the show to defend her honor.

As Clinton seated herself, a shocked Colbert said, 'Hillary Clinton!' to which Clinton responded: 'Now who's a name-dropper, Stephen?'

'Oh? Really? Name-dropper? That's not what my good friend Tom Hanks calls me when we're hanging out at George Clooney's place,' Colbert retorted.

Name dropper in chief: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stopped by the Colbert Report on Tuesday night for a name-dropping contest with show host Stephen Colbert after Colbert joked that her book is '656 pages of shameless name-dropping'

The two proceeded to recite canned dialogue about who knew more celebrities, including Oprah and former President Bill Clinton.

'I will have you know, Madame, I once did an entire show with President Bill Clinton,' Colbert said.

'I hate to break this to you, Stephen, but I've met him, too,' Clinton teased.

'God, you know everyone. What kind of a loser do you have to be to not be included in your book?' Colbert asks, just to find out moments later that he's not in Hard Choices.

Through with the name-dropping contest, Colbert says his other problem with Clinton's memoir is that there's no 'real' Hard Choices described in it, 'like which would you rather fight: one horse-sized duck or a hundred duck-sized horses.'

Clinton then explains how she'd resolve a duck-horse war, including meeting with Old McDonald, who owns the farm where they both grew up and creating a 'timetable to achieve meaningful horse-duck dialogue.'

'And Stephen, I'm convinced with patience and a strong commitment from our allies - the pigs and the geese - we'd have peace, peace, here, peace peace there, here a peace there a peace everywhere a peace!'

Clinton eventually tricked Colbert into telling his audience to buy her book by saying she won't 'appear' on his show without her face being blurred out if he doesn't promote her book.  

As Clinton appeared on set for her surprise drop in, a 'shocked' Colbert excitedly said, 'Hillary Clinton!' 'Now who's a name-dropper, Stephen?' Clinton said

'Don't you dare!': 'You were chanting my name four minutes ago, you two-timers,' Colbert said as the audience ecstatically clapped for Clinton and cheered her name

Colbert kicked off the segment by talking about Hillary's potential presidential candidacy, noting that the former first lady-turned senator-turned Secretary of State who is currently self-employed 'is the current frontrunner, which is surprising, since it sounds like she can't hold down a job.'

Mocking her star power and a tidbit in the book about Clinton sitting at a piano with Bono, Colbert said: 'Big deal. Bono sit with everybody at the piano.

Call me when you're sitting with David Bowie at a didgeridoo,' he added, as a picture of the Australian wind instrument popped up on screen.

'I just don't buy any of this. There is no way on earth one woman can be in so many places at once,' Colbert said as Clinton joined him on the set.

As the crowd clapped and chanted, 'Hillary!' The faux news show host told the audience: 'Don't you dare! You were chanting my name four minutes ago, you two-timers.'

Clinton, who has not formally announced her candidacy for president in 2016, is in fact the most well-traveled Secretary of State in U.S. history.

The former Obama administration official visited 112 countries during her four years in the position, prompting a one journalist to suggest she name her book The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries And It’s Still All About The Hair, a throwback to both Clinton's travels and her affinity for wearing outdated scrunchies.

In the author's note of Hard Choices, Clinton playfully acknowledged the recommendation.

'In the end, the title that best captured my experiences on the high wire of international diplomacy and my thoughts and feelings about what it will take to secure American leadership for the 21st century was Hard Choices,' Clinton wrote.
