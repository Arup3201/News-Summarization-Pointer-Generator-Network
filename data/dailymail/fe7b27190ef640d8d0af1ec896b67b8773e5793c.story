Britain is set for heavy downpours and a wet weekend after basking in the hottest day of the year yesterday.

The Met Office have issued yellow weather warnings for the south-east and south-west with up to half a months rainfall expected in the space of three hours today.

In London and the south-east up to 40mm of rain could fall compared with an average June rainfall of 73mm.

Poor visibility: Downpours across the South East has led to poor driving conditions on the A130 at Chelmsford, Essex

Weather warnings: The Met Office warned of electircal storms and heavy rain today. Cars are pictured in Essex

Thunder warning: Heavy rain and storms are expected in the south-east and south-west today. Here lightning bolts can be seen in Kingsdown, Kent, yesterday morning

Wet weather alert: The Met Office have issued a yellow weather warning for the south-east and south-west with heavy rain expected. Up to 40mm could fall in places

However, although some areas of the country will have thunderstorms, it will be highly localised with many places staying dry.

The outlook is no better for the weekend, with more downpours expected ahead of the Wimbledon championships which start on Monday.

Met Office forecaster Tim Thorne said: 'There has been a light band of rain across parts of Wales this morning but nothing too substantial with around 5 or 6mm of rain.

'Heavier showers will hit later and the south-west will probably see the worst of it this morning and until mid-afternoon. The south-east will also see some heavy stuff moving up from the continent.'

A warning on the Met Office website said that in the south-east, East Anglia and the Midlands there could be some heavy rain.

'These could give 15-20 mm of rain within an hour and 40 mm within 3 hours very locally. However many places could stay dry,' it said.

Wet weekend: Forecasters are warning of heavy downpours today - with the rain lasting into the weekend

Yesterday was the warmest day of the year, with temperatures peaking at 26.4C in Herstmonceux, East Sussex.

Forecaster Mr Thorne added: 'It is a rude awakening - back to what we have seen in the summer at this time in the last few years.'

He added: 'Tomorrow there will be rain which will be heavy in places with thundery showers. Yesterday saw the warmest day of the year but temperatures will start to go down.

'It will be 21C at best tomorrow with 18C or 19C in most places.

'On Saturday an Atlantic weather stream comes in from the west and it is all change. A band of rain goes through central parts and the south-east during the morning.

'It is quite a windy day with showers and longer spells of rain. It is likely to be 16C in the north and 18 in the south, south-east and East Anglia.

'Looking ahead to Sunday, it is very windy and probably gales in parts of western Britain. There will be longer spells of rain across Scotland and in England there will be a blanket of showers across the south.

'Temperatures will be similar to Saturday with around 17C or 18C in the south.'

However, forecasters said tennis fans can look forward to largely pleasant weather for the opening week of Wimbledon.

With
the mercury due to hit highs this week, sports fans will be hoping they
will be spared rain for the two-week championship, which starts on 
Monday.

Rain stopping play 
has become a well-known feature of the grand slam, and last year saw the
centre court roof deployed a number of times when the heavens opened.

But visitors to SW19 can expect only a few showers next week, with even some hope of sunshine, forecasters said today.

Downpour: the south-east, Wales, the north-west and Scotland are hit by rain shortly after midday today. There are isolated pockets of rain elsewhere

Brendan Jones, senior forecaster at Meteogroup, the Press Association's weather division, said: 'At the moment based on our forecasts, it's not actually too bad for the opening week.

'I don't think we're going to have any hot weather like we are this week, the temperatures will be close to average.

'There is likely to be quite a lot of dry weather but there will be some rain interruptions no doubt - at least next week we can be reasonably confident there won't be any huge deluges.'

He said there could be a few showers on Monday as they drift across the country, but the chances of catching one at the All England club would be fairly small.

'It should hopefully be generally dry with just a few showers coming through,' he said.

'People will see some tennis, and they might well see some sunshine if they're lucky.'

Temperatures are likely to be in the low-20s, possibly the high teens, he said, with the second week of the tournament looking at the moment like it could be quite similar.

'The week after, at this stage, there's not a great deal of change, it will be quite similar to next week.'
