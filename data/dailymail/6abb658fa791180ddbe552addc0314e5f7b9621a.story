A virus that spreads through wifi networks as effectively as a human cold moves through densely populated areas has been revealed.

The experimental virus, called Chameleon, was able to spread quickly between homes and businesses.

It could avoid detection and identify the points at which WiFi access is least protected by encryption and passwords.

The researchers say their virus could spread through cities as effectively as the common cold virus

The chameleon virus can travel between WiFi networks via Access Points (APs) that connect households and businesses to WiFi networks.

It was able to avoid detection and identify the points at which WiFi access is least protected by encryption and passwords, using them to hop between networks.

Chameleon was able to avoid detection as current virus detection systems look for viruses that are present on the internet or computers, but Chameleon is only ever present in the WiFi network

The University of Liverpool team simulated an attack on Belfast and London in a laboratory setting, and found that Chameleon behaved like an airborne virus, travelling across the WiFi network via Access Points (APs) that connect households and businesses to WiFi networks.

The team say major cities are at risk of attacks from similar systems created by hackers.

Areas that are more densely populated have more wifi access points in closer proximity to each other, which meant that the virus propagated more quickly, particularly across networks connectable within a 10-50 metre radius.

Alan Marshall, Professor of Network Security at the University, said: 'When Chameleon attacked an AP it didn’t affect how it worked, but was able to collect and report the credentials of all other WiFi users who connected to it. 

'The virus then sought out other WiFi APs that it could connect to and infect.'

Chameleon was able to avoid detection as current virus detection systems look for viruses that are present on the internet or computers, but Chameleon is only ever present in the WiFi network.

Whilst many APs are sufficiently encrypted and password protected, the virus simply moved on to find those which weren’t strongly protected including open access WiFi points common in locations such as coffee shops and airports.

Although the virus is currently experimental, researchers warn it could be used by hackers to collect and report the passwords of users who connect to infected networks.

Professor Marshall continued said: 'WiFi connections are increasingly a target for computer hackers because of well-documented security vulnerabilities, which make it difficult to detect and defend against a virus.

'It was assumed, however, that it wasn’t possible to develop a virus that could attack WiFi networks but we demonstrated that this is possible and that it can spread quickly.

'We are now able to use the data generated from this study to develop a new technique to identify when an attack is likely.'
