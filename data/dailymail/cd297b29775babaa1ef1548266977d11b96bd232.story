The Dean of Undergraduate Education at Harvard University, Jay M. Harris, announced on Tuesday that the most commonly awarded grade at Harvard is, 'actually a straight A.'

Shockingly, the median grade is lower than the most common grade at an A-.

Harris addressed the faculty on Tuesday in response to a question from government professor Harvey C. Mansfield '53 regarding the college's apparent grade inflation, reported The Harvard Crimson. 

At Harvard University the most commonly awarded grade is an A

Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield (left) confronted The Dean of Education Jay M. Harris (right) on Tuesday about the rise in A's and the lowering of educational standards

During the meeting's question and answer period, Mansfield piped up and said, ' a little bird has told me that the most frequently given grade at Harvard College right now is an A-'

He called Harvard's grading practice 'indefensible.'

'If this is true or nearly true, it represents a failure on the part of this faculty and its leadership to maintain our academic standard,' he continued. 

Harvard University is an Ivy League school known for academic excellence

Mansfield told The Harvard Crimson that he was 'depressed' upon hearing that an A was the most commonly awarded grade but said he was not 'surprised.'

'I thought the most prevalent grade was an A-minus, which is bad enough,' Mansfield said Tuesday to Boston.com. When I asked the question [about the most frequently given grade], it was worse,'he said.

'Nor was I surprised at the embarrassed silence in the whole room and especially at the polished table (as I call it),' Mansfield said in regards to the table at the front of the room where high-ranking administrators sit.

Terrell Woods class of 2011 gave their opinion to MailOnline. 'In regards to the grade inflation scandal at the moment I would say I personally never felt my grades were inflated. I think that’s something everyone might say.

I 'd say if there were any credence to the story it would have to do with departmental differences. In larger departments, students are more able to choose course work they’d be better at succeeding in. Economics, for instance, is one of the largest departments at Harvard. I studied visual and environmental studies which are much smaller departments.’

Harvard's grading policy was also criticized in 2001 but little has been done to curb inflation

Mr Mansfield believes that the grade inflation takes away merit from the University's most talented students.

He told Boston.com that he actually awards students two separate grades: the one that will go on their transcript and the one that they 'deserve.'

'I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade,' he said, adding that administrators must be the ones to change the grading methods.

Boston.com spoke to students who didn't necessarily recognize the grade inflation.

'I just find that hard to believe because it’s pretty hard to get an A in any class,' said Connor Mangan, 20, a junior neurobiology major.

A Harvard economics major Seiste Goffard, 20 said,'I think it [grade inflation] definitely exists.'

'I think students and faculty, the data they have all point to the fact that it’s an issue here more than elsewhere,' she continued.

This is actually not the first time Harvard went under fire for a lackadaisical grading policy.

In 2001, John Stossel did a story for ABC on how grades, 'don't mean what they once meant' at Harvard.

Mansfield was quoted as saying back then, 'To a give a student a C is like plunging a sword into his vitals.'

Mansfield said he's been fighting the inflation battle for years--years before 2001.

One student named Jimmy Davis told Stossel that he knew students who were awarded a B  or B- for doing less than 5 per cent of the coursework.

Grading measures have drastically changed over the years at Harvard. In 1969, 25 per cent of students got C's and lower. Only 7 per cent got A's back then. In 2001 only 9 per cent got a C or lower and over 26 per cent got A's.

One cheeky Harvard student told Stossel that perhaps students are smarter now than the Harvard students in the 1960s. 

Yale University wants to tackle its grade inflation problem but fears that toughening standards will sway students towards attending other schools

Is this Just a Harvard problem? Apparently not.

Schools such as Princeton and Yale have openly discussed their schools' own grade inflation.

Yale Daily News reported that last spring, Yale's ad hoc committee found that 62 per cent of Yale College grades between 2010 and 2012 were in A range.

There was a similar grade inflation problem at Princeton. When the school took measures to implement a new policy, It wasn't an entirely positive outcome. Critics call Yale's attempts to lower grades, 'grade deflation.'

The New York Times reports that when Princeton implemented a stricter grading policy to curb A's, less students applied/ enrolled in the school for fear that an overly competitive school (more so than equally regarded schools with more lenient grading policies) would hurt them in the future Job market

Princeton students reported that they were unhappy due to lower grades and fear that they will have trouble competing against Ivy League peers (at equally regarded schools) in the job market

In 2009, students in the A range at Princeton fell below 40 per cent.

In 2010, 32 per cent of students said the grading policy was their top source of unhappiness followed by lack of sleep at 25 per cent.  

The dean of the undergraduate college at Princeton in 2010, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, said that the goal was to have no more than 35 per cent of grades in classes be in the A range.

The Yale Daily New reports that ever since Princeton implemented the strict grading policies, Princeton's admissions yield dropped from 73.1 per cent for the class of 2007 to 68.7 to the class of 2013.

When the Mail Online tried to contact several Ivy League schools about their mean and median grade point averegages, all of the schools said that they could not 'disclose that information.'

Gradeinflation.com had some scattered data about grade inflation at Ivy League schools. Data was measured based on a scale of 4.0 being the highest--or an 'A'.

The average G.P.A at Dartmouth in 1931 was 2.33. There was a dramatic increase over the years. In 2007 it went up to 3.42.

At Columbia university the average G.P.A was 3.20 in 1982 and went up to 2.42 in 2006.

Cornell saw an increase in G.P.A in more recent years.  In 1990 the average G.P.A. was 3.13 and in 2006 it went up to 3.36.

Perhaps grade inflation is not a Harvard problem, but a problem of the current generation of college students at Ivy League Schools and beyond.

Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield '53 was so upset about grade inflation, he started giving students two grades--one for their transcript and one for what they 'deserve'

'If this is true or nearly true, it 
represents a failure on the part of this faculty and its leadership to 
maintain our academic standard,'said Mansfield

When Princeton attempted to stop grade inflation by giving out less A's, the schools yield rate declined and so did student's happiness rating
