Drummer Lee Rigby, of the Royal Fusiliers, was brutally murdered by extremists as he walked along a street in Woolwich, south-east London last May

Work has begun to engrave the name of Lee Rigby and 16 other forces heroes killed on duty in 2013 on Britain's largest military memorial.

The Fusilier, killed by Islamic extremists in a street in Woolwich, south-east London last year, will be immortalised alongside 16,000 other military personnel at the Armed Forces Memorial in the National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire.

Stonemason Nick Hindle began producing the tribute yesterday morning and is expected to take several weeks to chisel the name of the murdered soldier, and 16 others killed last year, into the Portland stone walls.

The 17 armed forces personnel killed on duty in 2013 is the lowest annual total since 1946.

Mr Hindle said: 'It's painstaking work, but given the scale of sacrifice it represents, it's a job I'm hugely honoured to do.

'Carving around ten letters per hour, I expect to be working on the memorial for several weeks.

'Visitors are always moved at seeing me add so many names and I'll regularly stop and answer their questions about the process.

'I have done some military work before, but this is one of the biggest monuments in the country.

'You really are concentrating on what you are doing, but at the same time you cannot help but think of the stories behind each and every name.

'Everything has been double checked, cross checked and signed off to make sure there are no mistakes and it is all measured out very carefully.'

Father-of-one Lee Rigby was just 25 when he was brutally murdered outside Woolwich Barracks on May 22 last year.

In February this year, Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, were jailed for life for hitting the dad-of-one with a car before attacking him with knives and a meat cleaver.

Lee Rigby's name is now being etched into the Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire by engraver Nick Hindle

His name will appear alongside those of 16 other servicemen and women killed on duty in 2013 and 16,000 other armed forces personnel whose names are already on the memorial

The names of three army reservists who died from overheating on an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons are also due to be engraved.

L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, L/Cpl Edward Maher, 31, and Cpl James Dunsby, 31, collapsed on July 13 after a 40-mile hike in 29.5C temperatures.

Andrew Baud, spokesperson for The Royal British Legion, added: 'The Armed Forces Memorial has got the names of 16,000 men and women killed since the end of World War Two.

'The names will be dedicated in a special services of commemoration later in the year.

'Many families tell us that they feel great pride that their loved one's name is etched forever on the memorial's Portland Stone walls.'

The Armed Forces Memorial, opened by the Queen in 2007, is the nation's tribute to the personnel who have died on duty or through terrorism since 1948.

The 150-acre Staffordshire arboretum is also home to more than 250 other memorials.

They include tributes to the police, fire and ambulance services as well as those of a number of other organisations.
