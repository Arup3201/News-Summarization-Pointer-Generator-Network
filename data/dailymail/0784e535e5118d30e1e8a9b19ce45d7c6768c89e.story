Deadpool is a fantastic character trapped in an average game. And no matter how many times he sends the fourth wall crashing down, repetitive, uninspired gameplay stops the title from fulfilling its potential.

There’s no denying that High Moon Studios (behind the respectable Transformers: Fall Of Cyberton) have done Marvel’s ‘Merc with a mouth’ justice.

Likeable: There's no faulting High Moon's efforts in bringing Deadpool to life, however gameplay is very dull

The disfigured and mentally unstable anti-hero’s screen presence is infectious from the outset – helped by Uncharted actor Nolan North’s efforts.

Crude, vulgar, frequently offensive and packed with one-liners, North illustrates Deadpool’s volatile unpredictability with aplomb (bar the odd tasteless gaffe). It’s no surprise, then, that parts when he’s allowed to take centre stage (or share it with some welcome X-Men) are the game’s highlights.

Sadly, it’s when Deadpool plays second fiddle to the bread and butter gameplay that cracks start to appear. Most levels – although featuring some ingenious Deadpool-orchestrated mini-sections – involve running through linear levels taking out as many baddies as possible.

Gameplay is wafer thin – propped up with a simple upgrade system that isn’t as enjoyable as it could have been. Upgrading weapons, for example, sounds good in theory but shooting is so clunky you’ll be sticking to Deadpool's blades for the most part.

Sadly, Deadpool’s hand-to-hand repertoire soon becomes as repetitive as his one-liners, with most combos following the ‘hit, teleport, hit’ pattern. Chances to show off his creative stealth kills are few and far between, too.

Graphically, it’s hit and miss. Levels are drab and lack detail, enemies all look the same and Deadpool’s animation is inconsistent.

Far from a blast: There are plenty of weapons available but most of the time you'll stick to melee moves

Still, cutscenes are well-realised, while comic-book-style movies that give you certain characters’ backstories, will please hardcore fans.

Deadpool proudly boasts that this is ‘HIS’ game. It’s ironic then that such an interesting, zany and unpredictable character has delivered such a run-of-the-mill hack and slash bore.

Deadpool is out now.
