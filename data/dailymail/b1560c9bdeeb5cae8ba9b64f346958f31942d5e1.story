A groom was forced to drink his wedding breakfast through a straw after being punched while on his stag do so hard that he broke his jaw in three places.

Philip Bagnall, 33, was celebrating in Wigan, Greater Manchester, while dressed in an Elvis costume when he was hit in the face by Joshua McCormick, then 19, as he waited for a taxi.

The unprovoked attack, which happened on November 15 last year, left father-of-three Mr Bagnall in hospital for five days, and meant he had to cancel his honeymoon and take time off work.

Philip Bagnall, 33 (left and right with bride Vicky), was punched so hard by Joshua McCormick, then 19, while out on his stag do that he was left with fractures on both sides of his jaw.

Mr Bagnall was forced to stay in hospital for five days afterwards and was released just in time for his wedding, but had to have the expensive breakfast liquidized and fed to him through a straw

Mr Bagnall was released from hospital in time to attend his wedding day, but had trouble saying his vows and making his speech, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

The celebrations began as Mr Bagnall and his friends went to a dog racing track before heading back to his hometown of Ashton-in-Makerfield to continue the party.

It was late in the evening, as Mr Bagnall was waiting for a taxi home, that McCormick struck.

Graham Pickavance, prosecuting, said McCormick had drunk an 'astonishing' amount of alcohol before the assault, including five cans of lager, six Jaeger bombs and six vodka red bulls.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Mr Bagnall had to take unpaid time off work because of his injury, forcing his wife to pick up extra shifts to make ends meet, and forcing the couple to cancel their honeymoon

He then lashed out at Mr Bagnall for no apparent reason, sending the plastics factory worker falling to the floor, and leaving him with a total of three fractures on either side of his jaw.

McCormick, now 20, was sentenced to two years in a young offenders' institution after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm 

He had to take unpaid time off from his job because of the injuries, forcing bride-to-be Vicky to pick up extra shifts to make ends meet.

He was also unable to enjoy his wedding day properly, and had to have his expensive wedding breakfast liquidized and fed to him through a straw.

He struggled to read his vows and speech, and had to watch how much he was drinking because of the painkillers he was taking. 

He also said he had trouble looking after the couple's three children, because he was afraid they would touch his jaw. 

The court heard that McCormick, now 20, waited at the scene for a taxi to take Mr Bagnall away. 

He also handed himself in to police after a local newspaper ran CCTV images of him alongside an article detailing the extent of Mr Bagnall's injuries.

After his arrest he told a probation officer 'I could have killed him', and showed genuine remorse and shame for his actions, according to his lawyer Steven Swift.

He admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and was handed a two-year custodial sentence in a young offenders’ institution.

Sentencing McCormick, Judge Brian Lewis said: 'This was completely unprovoked violence which people are sick of seeing on our streets.

'You hit him hard to the face for reasons which aren’t really clear. It was completely unprovoked, he went backwards onto the ground where he hit his head.

Father-of-three Mr Bagnall said his injuries meant he had difficulty reading his vows and giving his speech, and also had to watch how much he drank on his big day because of medication he was taking

Mr Bagnall began celebrating with friends at a dog tack on November 15 last year before going back to his home town of Ashton-in-Makerfield to carry on celebrating when the attack took place

'You said to the probation officer “I’m lucky I didn’t kill him". You never said anything truer.

'This court is only too familiar with manslaughter cases that arise in the same way.'

The judge also commended a stranger, Kayleigh Williams, who was also waiting for a taxi home and voluntarily went with Mr Bagnall in a cab to hospital.

He praised her public-spirited action and awarded her £300 from public funds.
