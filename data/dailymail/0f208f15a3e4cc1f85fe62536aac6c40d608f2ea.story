They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and the owners of the SUV in this video clip would probably agree.

The shocking footage shows two couples engaged in a heated argument over a parking spot close to the shopping district in Serris, France last Saturday.

After a few moments, the man who lost the parking spot storms back to his car and drives off, leaving his angry, well-dressed female companion to follow on foot. 

Meanwhile, the elderly couple who claimed the parking spot walk off looking bemused by the altercation.

Fast-forward a couple of minutes, and the angry woman returns to the parked car, and appears to be keying the far side of the vehicle, before beating a hasty retreat.

As the elderly couple walk away, the angry woman can't resist continuing the argument

The video - which was shot by an onlooker from a building overlooking the road - then cuts to a close-up of the car which has a key scratch mark stretching all the way along one side.

Unfortunately for the owners, there's nothing to identify the woman, who keeps her sunglasses on throughout the incident.

There's no footage of the owners returning to the keyed car, but it's likely to have been  a very expensive shopping trip for the pair.

A few minutes later, the angry woman returns to parked car, checking around her to see if anyone is looking

The scorned woman can be seen walking closely along the side of the car before running off moments later
