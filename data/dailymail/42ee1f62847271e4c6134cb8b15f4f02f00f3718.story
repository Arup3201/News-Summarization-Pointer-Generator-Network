A skull dating back to the 1600s has been found in Australia, casting doubt over whether Captain Cook really was the first European to land on the east coast of the country.

In preparation for a murder investigation, police ran carbon dating tests on the intact human skull  but results showed it was a lot older than first expected.

Results found that the skull, found near Taree a large town about 200 miles north of Sydney recently, could date back to the mid-1600s, 120 years before Captain Cook landed in Australia.

Here before Captain Cook? Carbon dating of this skull found in Australia recently suggested that the person, a white male, was born in the mid-1600s, almost 100 years before Captain Cook arrived in the country

Expert Stewart Fallon from the Australian National University, who did the carbon dating, was shocked to discover the age of the artefact, which tests confirmed was the male skull of a white European.

He told AFP: ‘We didn't know how old this one was. We assumed at first that it was going to be a very young sample.

‘When we first did it we weren't really thinking about people coming to Australia and things like that until we started to look at the dates and say, “Oh, that's becoming intriguing”.’

Dr Fallon said that carbon dating for dates after 1950 was very accurate but anything earlier was less clear. Two samples for the skull indicated two different dates but both were within the error range. He suggested there was a good chance that the man was born in the mid-1600s.

'Intriguing': Dr Stewart Fallon said carbon dating results suggested, with 80 per cent probability, that the skull was of a man born in the mid-1600s which came as a shock because he thought the remains were much younger on first inspection

He said: ‘Using [the dates] together we can do some modelling as to what we expect the calendar age to be ... and the way it works out by using those two dates is that we get about an 80 per cent probability that the person was born somewhere around the 1650s and died somewhere between 1660 and 1700.

The other possibility, which Dr Fallon gave a one-in-five probability, was that the man was born between 1780 and 1790, and died between 1805 and 1810.

Historians have been cautious about the discovery, suggesting it does not necessarily refute Captain Cook’s claim.

Archaeologist Adam Ford said that because the skull was found without other remains, it could have been imported as part of a private collection.

He told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph: 
‘Before we rewrite the history of European settlement we have to 
consider a number of issues, particularly the circumstances of the 
discovery.

Don't rewrite history just yet: Historians have been cautious with one suggesting that the skull (right) may have been imported to Australia as part of a private collection because it was found without other remains. Captain Cook (left) reached the east coast of Australia in 1770

‘The fact the skull is in good condition and found alone could easily point to it coming from a private collection and skulls were very popular with collectors in the 19th century.’

Cassie Mercer, an Australian historical researcher said: ‘If the skull does pre-date British settlement, it may be a tragic yet fascinating clue to the little-known history of early interactions between First Australians and the outside world.’

Detective Sergeant John Williamson said: ‘The DNA determined the skull 
was a male and the anthropologist report states the skull is that of a 
Caucasoid aged anywhere from 28 to 65.’

Captain Cook is thought to be the first white person to reach the east coast of Australia when he reached shore in April 1770.

He declared the east British soil, four months later. Dutch explorers reached the north and west coasts in the early 1600s.
