Snow baby: Anna the fox has lived with Russian scientist Irina Mukhamedshina since she was a cub. She understands as many commands as a pet dog

Like any well-behaved pet, she understands words such as 'sit', 'stand up', 'lie down' - and knows her own name.

But Anna is no ordinary domesticated animal. She is an endearing and impeccably mannered fox who has been trained to live alongside humans.

The woman responsible for her unlikely transformation is Irina Mukhamedshina, a 22-year-old Russian scientist who adopted her and another fox called Elma from  the Novosibirsk of Cytology and Genetics, which has studied how animals evolved from their feral ancestors to live alongside humans.

She saw animals at the institute,
 which began taming foxes in the 1950s and now has more than 50 
generations in its breeding programme, waggling their tails and 
clamouring for human attention in the same way as dogs and wondered if 
they could also be trained like them.

Both her subjects were tiny cubs when they came to her but quickly grew into a companion that Irina views as halfway between a cat and a dog.

'I needed them to be young, because then I could use food motivation to train some basic commands,' Irina, an experienced dog trainer, told The Siberian Times.

Her first task was getting the animals to come close to her, a process she found easy.

After
 this she moved on to basic commands, which took the foxes three weeks of 15 minute sessions 
to master. They soon began to recognise their own names and would come to her for affection.

Her
 work attracted international fascination. A Japanese film crew recorded
 Irina's work with foxes and were amazed at her achievements.

She has now written an essay on her experiences and hopes to continue exploring the ways that foxes can be trained.

Some
 of the foxes, like Anna, have been sold to curious animal lovers.

Others have been sold to fur farms because they are less distressed in captivity.

She
 said: 'Psychologically I understand them better now. Tamed foxes are 
not quite like dogs, they are more in between dogs and cats in how they 
respond to humans.'

The Cytology and Genetics farm is in 
Akademgorodok, the academic region of Siberia's largest city, 
Novosibirsk. It is unique in the world as it has several hundred tamed 
foxes.

Its groundbreaking work began in the 
1950s, when Soviet biologist Dmitry Belyaev gathered foxes from fur 
farms and bred the friendliest and least ferocious animals. He wanted to
 test a theory by Charles Darwin that domestication physically changes 
animals.

By the mid-1960s, the foxes had gone 
from wild to not fearing humans to actively seeking to befriend them. 
His team started to notice not only behavioural changes such as wagging 
their tails and licking their human caretakers to show affection, 
but also physical changes, such as spotted coats, floppy ears, and 
curled tails.

The effect has been dubbed the domestication phenotype. His
 research drew the ire of Cold War politicians, who saw genetics as a 
western science, and he was lucky to be able to continue his work until 
his death in 1985, when it was taken over by Irina’s mentor Dr Lyudmila Trut.
