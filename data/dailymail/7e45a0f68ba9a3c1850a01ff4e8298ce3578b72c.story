A daughter who was abused by her mother when she was seven years old is calling for more help to be given to the 'forgotten victims' of paedophiles.

Kelly Whitfield, from Tyne and Wear, was still a schoolgirl when she stripped naked by her mother Martha Owens, who watched on as she was abused by her step-father Frederick Dixon. 

Now, in the wake of several high profile sex abuse trials, the 42-year-old - who waived her anonymity to talk about her ordeal - is demanding more is done to help those whose lives are ruined by paedophiles.

Kelly Whitfield, 42, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, who was abused by 
her mother and step-father when she was a schoolgirl, says more need to 
be done to help the 'forgotten victims' of paedophiles

She said: 'All too often the emphasis is on the abuser and the victims are forgotten about.

'They are children and they need help and support because they often don’t understand what’s happening to them - how could they?'

Miss Whitfield suffered in silence for decades as she struggled to come to terms with the abuse.

But she says the wave of recent sex abuse allegations - including an alleged paedophile ring in Westminster and trials involving well-known defendants - gave her the strength to speak out.

Miss Whitfield said: 'I’m coming to terms with the abuse now but I don’t know if I’ll ever come to terms with the abuser being my mum.

'A mum is supposed to protect you, to look after you, to make sure this never happens. But she gave me to him.

Martha Owens, from Sunderland, stripped her daughter naked before watching as Miss Whitfield's step-father abused her

'My mother got a nine-month suspended sentence for what she did. I got a life sentence.'

Owens, 63, of Goodwood Road, Grindon, Sunderland, pleaded guilty to four charges of indecent assault last year at Newcastle Crown Court.

She was given a nine-month jail term, suspended for two years.

The court heard Owens carried out the offences out of a desire 'not to cross' Dixon.

Dixon denied the allegations and committed suicide on New Year’s Eve that year, before his trial.

Miss Whitfield said: 'When all of this was happening to me my mam kept telling me it was OK - they both did.

'I was a child, I didn’t know what was happening. It was only as I got older that I realised this wasn’t right, that it wasn’t happening to other people.'

Miss Whitfield, now a mother herself, believes more education is needed and that more support should be offered at an earlier stage to those who are affected.

Her calls come after Children’s Commissioner Maggie Atkinson, former Gateshead Council’s director of Children’s Services, launched a national inquiry into sexual abuse.

The two-year probe will look specifically at sexual abuse within the family environment.

She said: 'Most of our children are raised in secure, loving homes but I’m sure many of us will be disturbed by how much abuse within the family goes unreported and how little is done to support the children who suffer.'

Miss Whitfield kept her abuse a secret for more than 30 years.

But, after years of counselling, she finally felt able to speak out over what had happened in her family. Her mother and step-father were arrested in 2012.

Owens, 63, last year pleaded guilty at Newcastle 
Crown Court to four counts of indecent assault. Her step-father Frederick Dixon, who
 denied the allegations, committed suicide before his trial

After the court case, she told the Sunderland Echo: 'Growing up, I couldn’t wear certain clothes, no make-up, no perfume. It was his way of making sure no one else would look at me.

'When I asked my mother about what he was doing to me, she’d just says “he’s doing it because he loves you”, and I believed her.

'I know it was him who abused me, who did all this stuff, but it would never have happened if it wasn’t for her.'

Sentencing Owens after last year's court case, Judge Paul Sloan QC said he accepted Owens herself suffered abuse at Dixon’s hands and that he was 'manipulative and controlling'.

He said: 'His influence explains your involvement in the commission of these offences and I accept, as is evident, you are truly remorseful and truly ashamed of what you did.'

Defending Owens, Tony Hawks said: 'The guilt and shame is something she will never get over.'
