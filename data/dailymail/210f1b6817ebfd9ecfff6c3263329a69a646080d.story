Miku the daredevil moggy is back in the arms of his loving owner after getting stuck on a 90ft high railway viaduct for three days.

The two-year-old grey and white cat was spotted on the viaduct above Stockport, Manchester, less than 300 metres from his home, on Wednesday afternoon.

The fearless feline was finally captured in a humane trap after he took the bait on Thursday night and was brought back down to earth on a cherry picker on Friday.

Terra fur-ma: Miku the moggy is back in the hands of owner Steven Jackson after getting stuck on a railway viaduct sparking a three day rescue operation

Perilous: The grey and white cat was spotted on the viaduct ledge 90ft above Stockport by an eagle-eyed worker sparking a three-day rescue attempt by RSPCA and firefighters who used a cherry picker to get him

Miku's owner Steven Jackson only 
realised adventurous Miku was the stricken cat when a friend posted an 
appeal for the owner on Facebook.

Mr Jackson, 20, said: 'Miku had been missing for three days and he is never normally gone that long.

'I was worried where he had gone when one of my friends posted an article on Facebook.

'I saw the picture and recognised Miku immediately. I could tell by his tail and he has a bit of an attitude.

'I was amazed, I can see the viaduct from my house but I would never expect to look for my cat up there. I was shocked.

Gotcha: Firefighters use a cherry picker to finally bring Miku back down to earth

'You always hear about these mad stories but you don't expect it to be your own cat.'

Following his rescue Miku was treated
to a luxury chicken liver pate dinner and taken to the RSPCA's hospital
for a check-up before he was reunited with Steven.

Mr Jackson,
an IT support worker, added: 'This is Miku's biggest adventure to date.
You usually find him in weird places but I think he has now found his 
limit.

'I want to thank 
everyone who has helped, there has been a lot of fuss and I really 
appreciate it. We have a few cats but he is my favourite.

'We always chill out together. I will have to lock the doors now and be a bit more protective - I think he needs a GPS collar.'

How did you get up there? The cat's tiny figure can be seen in the middle of the viaduct 90ft from the ground and five foot from the top of the viaduct. RSPCA and firefighters used a hydraulic lift to get up to the cat

Heather
Morris, the RSPCA inspector who rescued Miku, says she thinks he must 
have got on tracks at Stockport station and wandered down to the ledge.

She
said: 'It is an absolute miracle he was not hit by a train, 
electrocuted or fallen off the viaduct. He is the luckiest cat I have 
ever met.

'He has used up one of his nine lives, hopefully he has a few left.'

Huge: The viaduct is a landmark in Stockport but posed a challenge for RSPCA officers and firefighters who had to try to reach the cat safely. They stopped as darkeness fell on Thursday but returned today to catch it

Stockport
fire station manager Chris Mycock said: 'We worked with the RSPCA and 
used our hydraulic platform to bring the cat down to safety.

'We
generally don't attend cat rescues unless there could be potential risk
to life, whether that be a member of the public, someone from the RSPCA
or another partner agency.

'Although
the RSPCA is more than capable of rescuing animals, sometimes, like in 
this case, they don't have the right equipment to be able to reach 
them.'
