Britain has started spending again, fuelling the economic recovery.

Household spending leapt by the highest level for more than three years, as the nation was buoyed by a return to strong growth.

But there were warnings that the economic upturn is too reliant on on consumer spending while trade struggles.

Household spending rose by 0.8 per cent in the three months to September, the highest rate since mid-2010

The Office for National Statistics confirmed that the economy grew by 0.8 per cent from July to September.

However the overall economy remains 2.5 per cent below its pre-recession peak of early 2008.

Latest figures show household spending rose for an eighth successive quarter, with the 0.8 per cent increase the highest since the second quarter of 2010, as the recovery took hold.

Households spent £237billion in the third quarter of 2013, up from a low of £229billion two years ago.

The ONS said: ‘The growth in household consumption may reflect improving economic conditions over the year-to-date that would be supportive of this growth.’

While families returned to spending, exports dropped by 2.4 per cent - the sharpest fall since the second quarter of 2011 - while imports increased by 0.4 per cent.

The economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter of this year, bolstering signs that the recovery is taking hold

The net trade deficit increased from £5.5 billion to £8.9 billion over the period, the highest level since the third quarter of 2010.

Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said: ‘Growth in the UK continues to be driven onwards by private consumption, house building and investment. These elements have had to make up for a violent slip in exports.’

Wage rises lagging behind inflation meant the consumer growth behind the recovery was at risk, he said.

Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said: ‘The 2.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter fall in exports is extremely disappointing and net trade is currently a major drag on overall activity.

‘If the recovery is to be sustained at a healthy pace, it really does need a marked, extended pick-up in business investment and for exports to improve.’
