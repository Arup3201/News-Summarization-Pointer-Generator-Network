Cartoonists across the world have flooded the streets and the internet with powerful drawings in defiance of the armed gunmen who attempted to silence the satirical French newspaper, Charlie Hebdo.

Three men stormed the publication’s building in Paris on Wednesday, where they shot dead 12 people and injured 11. Amongst the victims were 10 journalists and at least four cartoonists.

Charlie Hebdo was well known for its controversial images which regularly satirised Islam amongst other religions, while the newspaper’s latest tweet featured a cartoon of Abu Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State. 

As tens of thousands of people gathered on the streets across the world to show support for those who were slaughtered, cartoonists everywhere took to their drawing pads in an effort to prove that pens are far mightier than swords.
