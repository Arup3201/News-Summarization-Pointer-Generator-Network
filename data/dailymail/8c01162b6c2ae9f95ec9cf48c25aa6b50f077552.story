Myrella Ikeda went into J. Sisters in New York's Midtown district - a favorite among celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Cameron Diaz - as a model for a story about the salon, showing a step-by-step transformation.

Eight hours later, she claims she left 'terrorized' looking like an 'ugly, horrible monster'.

The Brazilian national said her hair was in her hands after the treatment, with her scalp burned, stinging and itching, and part of it numb, according to The New York Daily News.

She is now suing the co-owner of the W. 57th St. parlor, Jonice Padhilha, and the hairdresser that worked on her, Antonio Luis Rosa, who she claims was on drugs at the time.

Ikeda is seeking $3 million in damages.

The incident is alleged to have occurred in 2011 and destroyed her potential modelling career and left her with depression, according to the personal injury lawsuit filed in Manhattan Federal Court.

'Ikeda arrived at the salon with anticipating that in a few hours she would have spectacular hair that would help launch a modeling career,' the lawsuit says.

'Ikeda went into J. Sisters normal, smiling, happy, with beautiful hair, thinking that she would leave beautiful, with a fantastic appearance to be featured in a magazine,' the lawsuit says.

“But eight hours later, she left the salon with physical and emotional trauma: her scalp and hair were burned, her modeling plans were in ruins, and she could not show herself publicly.”

She was leaving ugly, horrible, a monster, with a terrible appearance and a scary face, crying, desperate, feeling physically and psychologically destroyed, with her hair in her hands, her scalp burned, stinging and itching, and part of it numb,” the lawsuit says.

Ikeda’s hair grew back thinner, uneven and less lustrous than before, the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit claims Ikeda lost two years of her life as a result, refusing to leave the house

“She could no longer think of a career in cinema, television or photography.

'She had to give up work, study and opportunities, all her life became completely disorganized,” the lawsuit claims.

'Time passed, and Ikeda lost more than two critical years of her life, with no way to bring it back.'

J. Sisters have not commented.

In the lawsuit, Ikeda says that Padhilha called her after the incident and apologized, saying Rosa was on drugs.

The state of her hair caused her caused her to 'lose motivation for everything'.

J. Sisters is located at 41 W 57th St in New York's Midtown district

Glam: The salon is popular among celebrities like Cameron Diaz, Vanessa Williams and Naomi Campbell

'She had always been a normal person, healthy and happy,' it claims.

'Suddenly, she was depressed and unhappy, with no motivation to do anything.

'She had no will to groom herself.

'To groom herself for what?

'She could not eat, she was crying all the time ... Ikeda was ugly and nothing was going to change that, much less her self-esteem.'
