An Illinois mother told she was not allowed to breastfeed in public at a local YMCA fought back against bungling staff and won.

At the Two Rivers YMCA, in Moline IL, on Wednesday, a woman identified only as Nicole took a break from swimming with her family to breastfeed her 7 ½-month-old daughter only to be told by a male lifeguard to take it to the ladies bathroom, she instead took her story to local media and forced them to change their policy.

After subsequent media attention raised by the woman’s fit, the facility set aside a separate nursing area the next day, they also apologized to the infuriated mother.

Outraged: Nicole doesn't feel it's right for her to have to feed her toddler daughter in a bathroom

Nicole was approached by the lifeguard just as she was finishing feeding her daughter, she told WQAD.

‘You can’t do that here, but if you want to feed her you can go into the restroom over here and I will watch your kids for you,’ she told the station he said.

‘I thought, ‘I’m not going to take her into the bathroom and feed her, because I don’t even eat in the bathroom,’ she added.

She subsequently asked if there was a law prohibiting her from breastfeeding public, which there isn’t in Illinois.

Not against the law: Nicole contended the YMCA was violating her rights by forcing her into the bathroom

‘Um, I think there is,’ the ham-fisted lifeguard shot back.

Enraged, Nicole stormed off to find a supervisor to demand an explanation.

After the higher-up asked if the baby was covered, Nicole explained the baby doesn’t like to be covered, but that she feeds her very discreetly.

Nicole also noted this wasn’t the first time she breastfed her baby at the YMCA, and that she ‘never had anybody say anything to me so this was really awkward,’ she told the station.

In the wrong: The Two Rivers YMCA has since apologized to Nicole and set up a separate breastfeeding area

The YMCA announced on Facebook that they had set aside a specific area for breast feeding that it felt was a fair compromise for all after the outraged mother told her story to local media.

‘We created a nursing area (not in a bathroom) that we thought was comfortable and appropriate,’ read the post. ‘Our policy will change as the law dictates, as, of course, we do not want to violate anyone's rights.’

The facility also apologized to Nicole for the incident, according to WQAD.

This action was not enough for locals.

Not the first time: Nicole had previously breastfed her toddler at the YMCA multiple times without incident

‘Everywhere is fair game as far as I’m concerned,’ Julie Houk, of Davenport, IA, told the station.

Complaining that society has ‘over-sexualized breasts,’ Ms Houk also mentioned multiple instances of persecution while breastfeeding her young son at a local mall.

‘My issue in the mall happened just a few stores down from Victoria’s Secret, where you have these monster sized breasts in the window, so it really is a double standard,’ she griped.

Saying that she will not become a shut-in or give her baby formula just to be able to leave home, Nicole added that ‘until people are coming up harassing moms with a bottle, I don’t expect to be harassed either.’
