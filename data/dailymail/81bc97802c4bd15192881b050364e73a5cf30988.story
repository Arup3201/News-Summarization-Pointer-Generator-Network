Trouble is brewing at OId Trafford as Louis van Gaal continues to struggle to haul his stuttering Manchester United side into form.

Criticism is intensifying on the terraces as tactical decisions, including pushing Wayne Rooney into midfield, have come under scrutiny from the United fans as their richly talented side is still stalling in a crucial period of the season, having labored to a 1-1 draw at West Ham at the weekend.

Despite spending heavily in the summer, results have not consistently arrived. Here are the stats that shame Manchester United's season so far...

It's just like watching Moyes! 

Is Van Gaal getting off lightly compared to David Moyes? The stats would certainly suggest so. His United side currently have the same number of wins as Moyes’s team at this stage last season.

Rooney can't get involved

In his new deep midfield role as United’s quarterback, Wayne Rooney has yet to register a single shot on target in 2015 despite playing for 450 minutes. He is already a fair way behind the midfielders with the most shots on target this calendar year:

The last time United came from behind to win in the Premier League was a 4-1 win against Aston Villa last season. They have conceded the first goal nine times this season — they drew five and lost four of those games.

Under Sir Alex Ferguson, United won an average of 3.5 games a season from losing positions, and managed four last season under Moyes.

Playing matches on the hoof

United have played the second most long passes (35 yards or more) in the Premier League this season.

Shot-shy strikers are failing

For all the money spent on United’s attacking players, they have attempted a relatively low number of shots this season.

3 - United have kept just three clean sheets in their last 11 Premier League games.

26 - United have started 26 players in the Premier League this season (a joint league-high).
