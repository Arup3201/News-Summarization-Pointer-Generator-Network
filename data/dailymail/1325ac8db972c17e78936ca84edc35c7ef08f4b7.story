An Arizona landscaper has been arrested for branding his girlfriend's genitals with his initials.

Christopher Lynn Jackson, 49, of Chandler, is accused of drugging the unidentified woman at a baseball game, who later awoke in pain to find him with branding equipment and a butane torch.

She then found the letters 'C' and 'J' branded onto her 'vaginal area', Gawker.com reported.

Arrested: Christopher Lynn Jackson, 49, of Chandler, Arizona, has been arrested for branding a former girlfriend's genitals with his initials

Jackson, the owner of a landscaping business called Lawn Tamers, apparently bragged to his now ex-girlfriend about having done the same thing to other former girlfriends, according to court documents obtained by New Times.

He told the woman 'her vagina was his', after the incident in May.

The incident was only reported last week when the woman finally built up the confidence to come forward.

She claims the former couple were at a baseball game when Jackson asked her to go out dancing afterwards.

The victim told Jackson she was too tired, so her offered her 'energy pills', which actually made her pass out.

She awoke to find the assault taking place.

Jackson was arrested on a felony aggravated assault charge and booked into jail.
