On the up: UKIP party leader Nigel Farage can expect a strong performance in the European elections

Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party is on course for further success in next year's European elections, according to the latest poll.

In the 2014 contest 27 per cent of prospective voters would support UKIP, with Labour on 23 per cent and the Tories on 21 per cent.

The rise of Mr Farage's party has caused major headaches for the Conservatives and this will be the latest challenge from the right for David Cameron to contend with.

The poll for the Open Europe think tank also found that 39 per cent of those who had voted Tory in 2010 would back UKIP if the European election were held now.

In a general election, the poll suggested Labour would take 37 per cent of the votes.

This would give Labour an 11-point lead over the Conservatives on 26 per cent, with UKIP on 20 per cent.

The Liberal Democrats would be trailing behind on 9 per cent.

There was some good news for David Cameron though.

Widespread support was clear for his policy of renegotiating the UK's relationship with Brussels before putting the new settlement to a public vote by the end of 2017.

If a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU were held now, 37 per cent say that they would vote to remain in the EU compared to 41 per cent that say they would vote to leave.

However, if there was a significant return of powers to Westminster followed by a referendum, 47 per cent would vote to stay in the EU, while 32 per cent would still vote to leave.

Main parties: UKIP is a headache for David Cameron, left, as the party is attracting Tory voters and forÂ  Ed Miliband, right, as Mr Farage is only 2 per cent behind him on trust for the new EU negotiations

The Prime Minister was still rated as 
the party leader most likely to succeed in negotiating a better deal 
with 29 per cent backing him to win back powers, with Ed Miliband on 14 
per cent, Mr Farage on 12 per cent and Nick Clegg on 4 per cent.

Open Europe's director Mats Persson said: 'Whilst the Conservatives may be heading for a perfect storm in the EU elections, their overarching goal of a renegotiated position for the UK in the EU still enjoys substantial support from across the political spectrum.

'Most voters would clearly prefer to stay in the EU but on new membership terms, over withdrawing altogether.

'However, unless a new relationship can be negotiated, the UK electorate could well vote to leave the EU - which should also be a wake-up call for Labour and Lib Dems.'

Trusted: David Cameron, pictured talking to European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, was still voted the favoured party leader to lead EU negotiations on membership

'It's rather surprising that Mr Cameron, despite everything, is still the most trusted party leader to negotiate a better deal for the UK in Europe.

'However, it's obvious that all parties suffer from a major credibility deficit on EU issues.

'For this exact reason, Mr Cameron must press ahead with a robust reform agenda now. Waiting until 2015 will risk losing the public support he still enjoys.'
