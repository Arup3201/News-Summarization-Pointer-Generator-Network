The threat many families face of losing their home has been
starkly highlighted, as the towns and cities most at risk are revealed.

The list shows the risk is spread across England, and not
just confined to the north of the country where public sector austerity and
weak economic growth has hit areas hard.

The hot spot table shows homeowners in London and the east of England are also
struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and are issued repossession warnings.

But a separate study
showed that those in the south of the country were more likely to survive from the repossession claim, and cling on to their home.

Housing charity Shelter compiled the list of possession claims
using figures recorded by the Ministry of Justice. A possession claim is the
first step in a property being taking away from its owner, though not all cases
end in repossession.

Topping the bleak list is Barking and Dagenham in London,
where more than twice as many homes face repossession as the national average - as many as eight in every 1,000 properties.

Knowsley in the North West and Thurrock in the East of
England followed closely behind the top two, while Lewisham in south London and
Rossendale, also in the North West, came in at fourth and fifth place
respectively.

Chief executive of Shelter, Campbell Robb, said: ‘Most
people think that repossession will never happen to them, but rising
unemployment, rising living costs and high house prices mean that many people
are living close to the edge already, and risk falling into a spiral of debt
and repossession.

‘The journey from being a homeowner to becoming homeless is
frighteningly swift, with just one small thing like a wage cut, a health
problem or a job loss meaning that a family can no longer meet their mortgage
payments.

'When repossession happens, the impact on families is
devastating - research shows people think repossession is worse than having to
fight a child custody battle.'

However, further research shows that those in the north of
the country are less likely to survive the risk, and will lose their homes.

An analysis of court-ordered repossessions in the second
half of 2011, by chartered surveyors e.surv, found that the North East and the
M62 corridor were the regions where repossessions are rife.

Richard Sexton, business development director of e.surv,
said: ‘Spending cuts, negative real wage growth, falling house prices and
public sector unemployment have hit the North much harder than the South.

'This has opened up a gaping geographical divide in
repossessions levels.’

Researchers said they found a strong link between rising
unemployment and repossession claims, with the towns and cities facing the
highest risk also suffering a faster rate of unemployment .

Housing minister Grant Shapps said he is determined to help people facing the frightening possibility of loosing their home

As well as facing tougher criteria to take out a mortgage,
borrowers have also been hit by a steady rise in rates for new mortgages in
recent months, despite record low interest rates, as lenders deal with the
increased cost of funding a mortgage amid the weak economy and the ongoing
eurozone crisis.

More than a million existing mortgage borrowers also saw
their rates rise last month as a string of lenders put them up.

Mr Robb added: ‘Housing is the largest monthly cost for many
homeowners, yet the affordability of housing is not getting the same government
attention as the monthly costs of other essentials such as food or energy
bills.’

He said those struggling with mortgage arrears should
contact their mortgage provider to avoid repossession and seek advice from
bodies such as Shelter.

Housing Minister Grant Shapps said: ‘By tackling the record
deficit we inherited we’ve prevented the need for rapid rises in interest rates
that would have put pressure on hard-working families, meaning repossessions
are at their lowest level since 2007.

‘But I’m determined that help is available to those facing
the real and frightening prospect of losing their home.

‘That’s why I’ve given £19 million to councils so they can
offer short-term loans to struggling homeowners, and over £3 million to the
National Homelessness Advisory Service, run by Shelter and Citizens Advice, to
ensure help is on hand to families when they need it most.

‘Like Shelter, I would urge anyone struggling with their
mortgage to seek early help, so that repossession is always the last resort.”
