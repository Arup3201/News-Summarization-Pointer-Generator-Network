Kyle Minogue has quit The Voice UK after one series.

The pint-sized popstar – who replaced Jessie J as a coach on the singing competition for its third series – has decided to bow out from her role after just one year due to a schedule clash with her upcoming Kiss Me Once tour.

She wrote on her Facebook page: 'Hi Lovers, thanks to all of you for your incredible support throughout this past season of The Voice UK.

'I’m sad to say that, due to the timing of my European tour, I won’t be back for Season 4. I absolutely loved my time on the show, and I’ll miss all of the incredible people who were a part of my experience.

'I hope to see you all on my Kiss Me Once tour, and wish continued success to everyone at The Voice!'

She added on Twitter: #Lovers, due to timing of my tour I won’t be back next season for The Voice UK. Thanks to all who supported! Hope to see you on my KMO tour!'

The 45-year-old singer joined the panel with fellow newcomer Ricky Wilson, sitting alongside veteran coaches will.i.am and Sir Tom Jones.

The Voice producer Moira Ross said: 
'Kylie has brought her own very special magic to The Voice UK and we 
have loved having her on the show. We wish her well for her tour and 
hope to welcome her back in the future.'

Kylie performed on the final night last weekend with her act Jamie Johnson, but the contest was eventually won by Jermain Jackman.

Her decision not to return for the next season comes after the final of the UK show earned the lowest ratings to date - averaging 6.6 million viewers
across its two hours, which was down over 600,000 viewers on last 
year’s figure of 7.2 million and 2012′s 7.1 million.

The good news though 
was that the final of the series was significantly up on last week's 
series low which only managed to attract 5.9 million viewers.

Yet
 that's still almost two million viewers down on the figure that the 
show started with during the blind auditions of this year's 
Minogue-powered series of The Voice.

Kylie stunned fans when she announced last year that she would be joining the judging panel for the BBC talent show - after previously having turned down roles on other similar programmes.

However, explaining her decision to take part in the show, Kylie said: 'The producers told me all the statistics about how being on the show would boost my record sales, but I’d heard it all before. I said, "That’s great, but my question is
 to Will – how has the experience of being a coach on The Voice impacted
 on you?"

Boost: The addition of Kylie, seen here in London earlier this month, to the judging panel helped boost ratings on this year's show, but they were still disappointing

'He said he learned a lot about himself and how 
he reacts with his audience, and it’s true. You have no option but to be
 yourself, and it’s kind of liberating. At the end of a 13-hour day, 
when there’s still all those cameras about, there’s nowhere to hide. You
 have to let go.'

It
 remains to be seen whether will.i,am, Sir Tom and Ricky will follow in 
Kylie's footsteps or stay on the show for the next season.

Although she’s quit the British version, 
Kylie is expected to be a coach on the Australian version of The Voice 
with will.i.am this year.

The BBC is committed to a further two series of The Voice. Kylie's Kiss Me Once tour kicks off in Liverpool on 24th September this year.
