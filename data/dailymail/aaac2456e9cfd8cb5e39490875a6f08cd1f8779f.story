A bronze bust of former dictator Saddam Hussein which was found in debris in war-torn Iraq is being sold for a jaw-dropping $10million (£6million).

The 40kg war trophy was spotted by former US Army soldier Earl Torres, 47, from Las Vegas, as he cleared Baghdad International Airport in 2003.

The bust, which is around 17 inches in height, formed part of a 15ft statue of Saddam and was picked up by Torres who brought it back to the US after a 13-month tour of duty.

The statue was partially-destroyed after an intense battle in the airport which became the hub of American operations during the war in Iraq for seven years.

Torres, who served in the army for 14 years, has already attracted interest from potential buyers - but he says he is yet to agree on a price.

He said: 'I think it's something that will attract collectors and museums.

'It's one of many statues of Saddam that was found in Iraq at the time.

High value: The bust is expected to sell for around $10million

'It was in pieces so I was able to take the head and get documentation to take it through customs.

'I decided to wait for a while before trying to sell it so my children could grow up and see it.

'I believe it is the only one if its kind in the USA and it means a lot to me.

'I served my country and served it well and to be able to bring something home to show my family, show my friends, show them what was taking place was important.'
