Louis van Gaal got off to a perfect start as Manchester United manager with a 7-0 victory.

New boy Ander Herrera, signed from Athletic Bilbao for £24million this summer, stole the show with an impressive display in midfield as he created chance after chance for his new team-mates.

Danny Welbeck opened the scoring from distance before Wayne Rooney scored a brace to give Man United a 3-0 lead at half-time.

The second half saw 20-year-old defender Reece James score twice before Ashley Young also scored two in the final minutes courtesy of Herrera assists.

Louis van Gaal lands his first trophy as Manchester United manager... the Chevrolet Cup!

What a performance from the Red Devils and in particular Ander Herrera.

The Spaniard was the star performer in the middle of the park with some exquisite passing. What a signing he could prove to be!

The 24-year-old deserves his Man-of-the-Match award.

 

Great finish by Young but once again it's Herrera with a wonderful through ball.

Ashley Young latches on to a perfectly-timed through ball from Herrera and places the ball into an empty net after the goalkeeper rushed out.

James may be a defender but he certainly knows how to shoot.

The 20-year-old was first to react after Kagawa was denied by the onrushing Galaxy goalkeeper and passed the ball into the net from outside the area with his left boot.

The Japan international did well to control the ball and turn in the box to beat his defender but was unable to curl his shot on target.

The defender looks to have hurt his shoulder and has been replaced by Charlie Rugg.

After claiming the second 45 minutes hadn't really got going Manchester United score right on cue through 20-year-old defender Reece James.

Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: In traditional pre-season fashion, United made a host of changes at half-time with only Herrera and Fletcher surviving from the starting eleven.

Indeed such were the changes that Fletcher – captain for the night – found himself pushed in to the centre of defence so that Van Gaal could persist with his three-man back line. Not that any of this has done much to change the pattern of play.

United are still dominating the play and scored their fourth goal on the hour when Ashley Young crossed low from the left and young left-back Reece James marked his debut with a goal from 12 yards.

As is the case with many of these friendly matches when both sides make a host of changes at half-time.

Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler: David Beckham and Patrice Evra were surprise guests at Manchester United’s Los Angeles training base on Tuesday.Beckham, who has returned to live in London with his family after five-and-a-half years in California, is back in town for United’s first game on their pre-season tour of the United States against another of his former teams, LA Galaxy.He met up with new United boss Louis van Gaal and some of the players and is expected to attend the Chevrolet Cup match at the Rosebowl on Wednesday.Click the above link to read the full story.

Great start to Louis van Gaal's tenure at the club as the Red Devils lead 3-0 at the break.

Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: Tommy Meyer has somehow managed to fall over when trying to clear a routine low cross from Welbeck which has allowed Rooney to score his second, and United’s third, from just six yards.

Half-time here in California and United’s pre-season is up and running in some style.

Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: Lots of love on social media tonight for Ander Herrera and United’s new signing is having a nice game.

It was Antonio Valencia advancing from wing-back who won the penalty that has just given United their second goal, however.

Valencia worried AJ DeLaGarza and when he went past him and crossed from the right the Galaxy player lifted his arm to concede a penalty.

There were plenty of complaints from Galaxy players but it was a clear handball and Wayne Rooney converted the penalty with his right foot.

New boys Shaw and Herrera also made an appearance.

Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman: Robbie Keane is playing for Galaxy tonight and he has looked to operate in the spaces in between United’s back three.

He hasn’t really had much joy but he did get in behind Phil Jones in the 30th minute, only for the United central defender to get a toe on the ball as Keane was about to shoot. Keane thought he was being held by his opponent and appealed for a penalty but from where I am sitting he was never going to get it.

This really is a superb setting for a football match, by the way. The stadium isn’t quite full but there seems to be well over 60,000 in the ground.

...and if the game ends in a draw then both clubs will share the trophy.

Very old school like with the Charity Shield.

Galaxy left-back AJ DeLaGarza (what a great name) marauds forward and lets fly from 25 yards out but Man United's Spanish goalkeeper gets down to his right to deny the Guam international.

It may only be a friendly but the Red Devils look lively.

Herrera has been particularly impressive with his neat, tidy passing.

Only fifteen minutes gone here at the Rose Bowl in beautiful Pasadena and already Manchester United have their first goal under Louis van Gaal.

A bustling run from Juan Mata saw the ball break 20 yards from goal and Danny Welbeck swept it in off the post with a first time shot with his right foot.

United had started brightly before that, Juan Mata bringing a save from Galaxy goalkeeper Jamie Penedo from a similar distance.

Interesting also here that Van Gaal has sent United out to play with three central defenders, as he did with Holland in the World Cup.

Juan Mata lays the ball off to Welbeck who shoots from 20 yards out and sees his effort canon off the post and into the back of the net!

The first goal of the Van Gaal era!

Just two players who start tonight under Louis van Gaal appeared in David Moyes' first friendly as manager - Danny Welbeck and Jonny Evans.

 

but the Spaniard's shot is tipped over the bar.

Bright start from the £24million midfield man.

Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera both starting with midfielder Darren Fletcher preferred as captain over Wayne Rooney.

Manchester United starting XI: De Gea, Smalling, Jones, Evans, Valencia, Fletcher (c), Herrera, Shaw, Mata, Welbeck, Rooney.
