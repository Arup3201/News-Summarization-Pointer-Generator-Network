Companion: Michael Jackson, pictured, had an Eastern European lady friend whom he'd hug and kiss in the back of his chauffeur-driven car, his former bodyguards have claimed in a tell-all book

Michael Jackson had an Eastern European lady friend whom he'd hug and kiss in the back of his chauffeur-driven car, his former bodyguards have claimed in a tell-all book.

The bodyguards - Javon Beard and Bill Whitfield - write that the eccentric pop star sent them to pick up the mystery woman, referred to only as 'Friend,' as well as another woman, and he even sent them to buy presents for her from Tiffany.

In an excerpt from the book, 'Remember the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days,' obtained by New York Daily News, the former staffers describe the King of Pop's slender 5-feet-4 gal pal as 'drop-dead gorgeous.'

The men reveal how Jackson would allegedly visit her at night at a nearby Hampton Inn, after his kids went to bed.

But 'Friend' was not his only fancy.

The singer had another female visitor nicknamed 'Flower,' the bodyguards write.

'Flower' visited a few days after 'Friend' and while she and the pop star were close, Jackson was more fond of 'Friend,' Whitfield claims.

He says it was a big deal when 'Friend' came to town and the bodyguards had to ensure everything was ready for her arrival.

In the book, the men also claim Jackson was a strict father to his children and recall one instance when he disciplined Prince, now 17, when he failed to clean up after a dog he'd received as a gift.

Jackson moonwalked right into the dog's poop, the men claim, and then he 'chewed Prince out, big time,' ensuring his son followed the animal around with a dustpan and brush from then on.

Beard and Whitfield also gained a glimpse of the King of Pop's money woes while acting as his muscle, they claim.

The bodyguards write that they would sometimes go months without a paycheck from the world famous performer and witnessed Jackson splurge on a $10,000 shopping spree that ended when his credit card was declined.

Despite dishing out such insider info, a source told the Daily News that the duo do not intend to embarrass Jackson in the book, and were in fact 'very fond of him and loved his kids.'

'Remember the Time' will be published in June.
