Addressing the issue: Teenager Chris Whitehead wore his sister's skirt to class in protest at his school's ban on shorts which he said was unfair

A 13-year-old boy who wore a skirt to school in protest at a 'discriminatory' uniform ban on shorts was today given a prestigious human rights prize.

Chris Whitehead made headlines in May when he turned up for class in his younger sister's black skirt.

He was taking stand against a rule at Impington Village College near Cambridge which allowed girls to change into skirts during hot weather, while boys had to swelter in long trousers.

The Year 9 student said wearing trousers in the heat affected concentration levels and an ability to study in class.

His campaign made it onto national television when ITV's Daybreak presenter Adrian Chiles showed his support by wearing a floral skirt live on air.

Now the teenager has become a runner-up in Liberty's human rights young person of the year competition held at the Southbank Centre in London today.

Chris, who is a member of the school's student executive, said: 'I didn't think it would be that influential, but I'm really happy. It was a good surprise to be nominated.'

He had decided to take advantage of a 'silly loophole’ in the school's uniform policy which meant boys could wear skirts because the school would be guilty of discrimination if it tried to stop them.

He said at the time: ‘Wearing a skirt is just like wearing shorts with a gap in the middle. I don’t feel silly at all. I don’t embarrass easily.

‘I will be wearing the skirt at school all day in protest at the uniform policy and addressing the assembly with the school council.’

Backing: Chris, who sits on the school's student executive, with supporters at Impington Village College. The school later vowed to review the uniform ban

The 1,368-pupil school, which was classed as good in its last Ofsted inspection in 2006, imposed the ban two years ago after a consultation  with parents and teachers.

Its ‘Look Smart’ dress code stated students must wear ‘plain black tailored trousers or knee-length skirts without slits’ – but did not specify gender.

The school later promised to review its decision.

Chris, of Histon, Cambridgeshire, was the youngest nominee on the Liberty awards shortlist which includes Cerie Bullivant, who fought against government control orders, journalist and activist Zin Derfoufi, and Abigail Stepnitz of the Poppy Project for women.
