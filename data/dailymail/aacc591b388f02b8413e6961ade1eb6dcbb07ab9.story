Predatory: Paedophile Gavin Shaw, 54, has been jailed again after he tricked his way into shop jobs so he could meet children

A predatory paedophile whose identity police once tried to keep a secret has been jailed again after he tricked his way into shop jobs so he could meet children.

Gavin Shaw, 54, was arrested after he ignored a ruling banning him from mixing with children by moving from town to town, getting jobs in shops so he could meet young customers.

While working on a voluntary basis at one shop, Shaw, from Nelson, Lancashire, gave one little girl a toy and money as he sat her on his knee, and later became friendly with a boy.

Shaw, who has a history of child abuse spanning almost 40 years, was caught after officers visited him at home during a routine risk assessment and found out about his job.

As he was being arrested Shaw began to damage his computer and hurled an illegally held CS gas cannister at police, saying: 'You might as well lock me up for that as well.'

It emerged the shopkeeper who gave Shaw a job knew nothing of his background.

Burnley Crown Court heard Shaw had convictions for sex offences dating back to 1975 and had been sent to prison seven times. He had previously tricked another shopkeeper into giving him a job in a different town

Four years ago, Shaw was made subject of a ten year Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) after it emerged he was pretending to be a council officer, dressing up in a high-visibility jacket with his name on it to win the trust of children.

At the time police backed a legal application made by Shaw's defence team to keep his identity a secret amid fears he would fall victim to vigilante attacks.

The application was turned down when sex abuse victims argued that the public had a right to know about his activities.

Background: Burnley Crown Court heard Shaw had convictions for sex offences dating back to 1975 and had been sent to prison seven times

Shaw,
 once described as a 'clever child predator', is now starting an 18 
month prison sentence after he admitted breaching the SOPO and 
possessing a prohibited weapon for the discharge of noxious liquid or 
gas.

The court heard he had
 convictions for gross indecency, indecent assault and attempted serious
 sexual offences, and had previously been sentenced to prison terms of seven years, six years, four years and 41 months.

The SOPO was imposed in Shaw’s former hometown of Blackpool in 2010 just weeks after his release from jail when it emerged he had been adding children as young as 12 as friends on his Facebook page.

Breach: In 2012 Shaw was arrested again after he was spotted persuading children to get into the back of his van at the seaside resort of Morecambe

At the time police found Shaw with a bag of cuddly toys, which he said were for friends who had children.

The
 children - all under sixteen - were present when he went to their 
homes, leaving parents - who had been friendly with him - 'horrified' 
when they found out about his background. The order banned Shaw from 
working or associating with anyone under 16 unless supervised, with the 
prior approval of social services officials.

However,
 in 2012 Shaw was arrested again after moving 40 miles to Morecambe 
where he was spotted persuading youngsters to get into the back of his 
van.

1975: Shaw is first convicted for a sexual offence.

2004: According to his defence lawyers, this is the last year Shaw was convicted of molesting a child.

2010: Following his latest release from jail, Shaw is subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order after it emerges he has befriended children on Facebook. He is also accused of dressing in a hi-vis jacket to gain children's trust as they think he is a council worker.

2012: Shaw is arrested after moving to Morecambe where he was seen persuading children to get into his van.

He is jailed for 16 months in October and on his release the following year moves to Nelson.

April 2014: Shaw is arrested for breaching his SOPO

May 2014: Shaw is jailed for 18 months

He had befriended the 
children after getting a job at a shop in the seaside resort without 
telling his employers about his criminal record.

A local support worker, who had some concerns about Shaw, saw three or four children getting into the back of his van and called the police. It emerged he had taken a child to the beach and had bought him a Manchester United money box. as well as taking pictures of him.

In October 2012 Shaw was jailed for 16 months, but after his release moved 54 miles to Nelson and got a job at a shop in the town - again keeping his criminal history a secret from his new employer.

Although he was not paid, he regularly worked at the shop and would look after it unattended.

Charles Brown, prosecuting said: 'The prosecution would say there are elements of grooming in these particular circumstances.'

Robert Elias, mitigating, said Shaw had not been convicted of molesting a child for 10 years, and that he had 'moved on' from adolescent boys to gay men.

'He robustly denies having any sexual motive with the two children,' said Mr Elias.

'He didn’t seek them out. They came into the shop when he was there. He does have a human need to seek companionship and friendship.

'He knows and is resigned to a custodial sentence. He doesn’t consider himself to be a threat to children, but that is not the view of the probation service.'

Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said Shaw was assessed as 'high-risk' and told him: 'Court orders are there to be obeyed.

'The sexual offences prevention order is there to protect children.'
