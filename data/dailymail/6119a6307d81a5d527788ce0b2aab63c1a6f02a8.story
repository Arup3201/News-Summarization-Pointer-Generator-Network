Boxer and former Birmingham City and Sheffield United striker Curtis Woodhouse has caused uproar on Twitter for messages on his profile ridiculing the Oscar Pistorius trial.

Now retired from football at the age of 34, a post on Woodhouse's Twitter account read: ‘5 years for shooting your mrs, I’ve got a serious decision to make’, leading to a barrage of messages both in support and criticism of the Englishman.

Many in defence of Woodhouse said the Tweet was in criticism of the sentence length given to Pistorius, rather than the glamourisation of domestic violence.

Boxer and former Premier League striker Curtis Woodhouse caused uproar on Twitter on Tuesday

Woodhouse played three times in the Premier League for Birmingham City in 2002-03

Woodhouse had initially wrote this tweet appearing to ridicule the sentencing of Oscar Pistorius

He then retweeted several messages discussing whether Pistorius, who was jailed for five years on Tuesday for the manslaughter of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, would play for Sheffield United on his release.

This is thought to be in reference to the debate as to whether former Blades striker Ched Evans, released last week after being jailed for rape, would play for the club again.

He later tweeted: ‘With oscars pace and cheds goal scoring ability I think the blades will go up this season now.’

Woodhouse also told some female followers on Twitter to ‘take your crying elsewhere please love’, ‘get kettle on’ and ‘go and burn your bra’ when they objected to his tweets.

Woodhouse is now a professional boxer after 15 years in football. His record is 22 wins (13 by KO), 7 losses and no draws.  

He then joked that both Pistorius and Ched Evans could be playing for
