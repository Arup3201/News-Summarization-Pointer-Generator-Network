Hugo Lloris admits he was wrong to risk his health by demanding to play on during a game when he had been knocked unconscious and has applauded new rules protecting footballers against concussion damage.

The injury suffered by Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris last November proved the catalyst for changes in the Barclays Premier League this season which give doctors the right to overrule players and coaches where head injuries are concerned. There is also an independent doctor in the tunnel area to assist club doctors in making these decisions.

‘It is definitely a good thing,’ said Lloris. ‘We don’t have to play with our health and someone in the profession had the good sense to find something better.

Lesson learned: Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris realises it was wrong to play after being knocked unconscious

Sparko! The France No 1 was knocked out after a challenge by Everton's Romelu Lukaku in November 2013

‘I was a subject of that and so it is easier for me to understand the decision. I realise now that I had taken a risk with my health. It will not happen again.’

Lloris was knocked out in a collision with Romelu Lukaku at Everton last season, but recovered quickly and insisted upon playing on, even though Tottenham’s medical team wanted him to be replaced.

A week later, he was deemed not fit to play against Newcastle and manager Andre Villas-Boas was criticised for failing to protect his player. In the backlash, the Premier League decided it was time for change.

It was not the only high-profile head injury in football last season. Lukaku was also knocked out and played on against West Ham, as did Robert Huth, playing for Stoke against Manchester City. There were other incidents at the World Cup, involving Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira and Argentina’s Javier Mascherano, who both continued after being briefly knocked unconscious.

Lloris explained: ‘When you are on the pitch you don’t want to leave the pitch, you want to stay with your team-mates and help them get the best result. Now the rules are very clear and it will be better for everyone.’

It proved an eventful season for the Spurs and France keeper, who committed his future to the club, agreeing a new five-year deal before the World Cup and signing it on his return in July.

‘The decision was made before the World Cup,’ said Lloris, who faces QPR today. ‘I had some good chats with the chairman about the ambition and future of the club. The conditions were good for me.

‘We found an agreement and I’m happy for that. It was about ambition, definitely, not money. I am a competitor and I know that in the Premier League it is difficult to get trophies because there are a lot of top teams, but I know Tottenham has ambition to grow and improve year on year.’

He added: ‘I think everything is done for players to improve at Tottenham. We need maybe some stability after two years with two managers and we have to work together, keep a good spirit in the changing room and get some great performances, because last season we know that we did not do enough against the top teams in the League.’

Mauricio Pochettino took over as boss from Tim Sherwood, who replaced Villas-Boas soon after the incident at Goodison Park.

‘He (Pochettino) has a good CV as a manager and as a player he was an international with Argentina,’ said Lloris. ‘I know him because he played in France and he has a good philosophy about football. Somehow we have to work together and go in the same way, keep our ambition high and try to improve.’
