The White House has been put on lockdown after an unidentified man was caught trying to jump the fence Friday afternoon.

Secret Service officers apprehended the suspect and he is now in custody.

The man was said to be carrying two large bags but the agency has not released any further information about the incident.

They stressed to NBC News that they are not especially worried about the bags now that the man is in custody but they are following standard protocol.

That included a call to Washington's Metro Police Department's Explosive Ordinance Division and they are said to be investigating the bags now.

The Secret Service reported that the man did not make it over the fence before he was apprehended initially by Park Police and Uniformed Division officers.

President Obama was not in danger as he is currently on a trip to Michigan, which was timed to coincide with the signing of the new farm bill.

Shortly after the news broke about the lockdown, the press pool reported that the President had boarded Air Force One headed back to Washington, but that appeared to be just the trip staying on schedule rather than a reaction to the events at the White House.

Because the climber was caught in the early afternoon, the first daughters would not have been home at the time. MailOnline's calls about Michelle Obama's and her mother's locations at the time of the incident. The First Lady's mother Marian Robinson lives with the first family.
