The night before the legendary rapper has escalated his online vitriol into outright name-calling and apparently veiled threats. Snoop told Iggy to check herself before he did in an Instagram video posted late Tuesday night.

Hitting out: Snoop Dogg appeared to threaten Iggy by telling her to check herself before he did in an Instagram video posted late Tuesday night

Soon after the blonde singer's boyfriend Nick Young tweeted, 'Ain’t nobody worried about no SnoopLion .. This dude Just goin thru a midlife Crisis you Go get convertible yet . OG’s out here losin.'

Snoop originally said that the Australian rapper looked like man without make-up on as he posted various cruel memes.

But on Tuesday things clearly got a bit more ugly, as Snoop says in his short video: 'Say, b****, you’re f****** with the wrong n****, and your n**** better check you before I do.'

He has her side: Nick Young, with Iggy in August at the MTV Video Music Awards, stood up for his girlfriend with a tweet on Wednesday

Adding: 'You funky b****. Yeah, you. F****** c***.'

In what appeared to be a response to the video, as it was posted soon after, Iggy tweeted: 'its like the guy that asks for your number and then says you ugly and a b**** when you say no…' 

After Snoop initially blasted her online Iggy, 24, used Twitter to voice her displeasure at the comments, saying: 'Why would you post such a mean pic on insta when you send your body guards to ask me for pictures every time we are at shows?' 

She then added: 'I'm disappointed you'd be such an a** for no reason.'

Hitting back: Iggy responded to Snoop Dogg's Instagram post on Monday, suggesting she looks like a man without make up - she Tweeted the rapper saying: 'I'm disappointed you'd be such an a** for no reason'

The photo that started it: Snoop posted this shot which he said looked like Iggy with no makeup

TMZ reported the singer had made the post, but then deleted it from her account. 

The social media stoush started when the veteran 42-year-old rapper Instagrammed a picture of a blonde, long haired male on Monday with the caption 'Iggy Azalea no makeup.'

 It's not the first time he has taken pot shots at others in his sphere of work - he  previously feuded with legendary rapper Eazy-E and at one point called out America's entire East Coast.   

Many of Snoop's 3.5million-plus followers were also tickled by the derisive picture, as it scored thousands of likes and comments within hours.

It comes days after the Australian rapper was spotted sporting minimal makeup after she arrived at LAX airport last week.

Iggy looked a natural beauty, wrapping her enviable figure in a black thigh high slit maxi skirt and a dark greens sweater - but the Gin N' Juice rapper jested otherwise.

And while Snoop, who famously burst onto the hip hop scene over 20 years ago with a song dissing rapper Eazy-E, poked fun at Iggy, other American rappers have been harsher. 

Brushing it off: It's not the first time another performer has mentioned her name in recent months, as MC Rah Digga called Iggy out for 'not being real'

The rapper endured her share of controversy last month after fans perceived Nicki Minaj's BET Award acceptance speech as a dig at Iggy.

'What I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it,' she said - prompting many to assume that the Anaconda rapper was criticising her fellow female artist.

Nicki would later clarify her comments on social media and deny that any insult was meant by her comments, but another female rapper, MC Rah Digga, called Iggy out, saying her music 'is not real to me.'

But The New Classic in unperturbed, Tweeting 'Its definetly funny seeing people get so emotional over it all. What does it matter? Music is music and many enjoy mine, no need to feel upset.'
