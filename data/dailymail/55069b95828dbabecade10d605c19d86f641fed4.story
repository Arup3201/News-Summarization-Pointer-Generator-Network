A New York taxi driver who hit and killed a nine-year-old boy will not be charged because of 'two strikes' loophole in the law.

Cooper Stock was crossing West End Avenue with his father in front of their apartment building in January when police say driver Koffi Komlani failed to stop, hitting them both and crushing Cooper under the wheels.

But now his mother has revealed Komlani of West Harriman will not spend a single day in jail because of a bizarre gap in the law which requires two separate citations to prove criminality, reports Eyewitness News.

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance concluded he could not charge him with vehicular homicide and police cited Kolmani with just one citation - failure to yield to a pedestrian.

He will get a couple of points off of his license and possibly pay a $300 fine. The TLC has now revoked Kolmani's license to drive a cab.

The news has devastated Cooper's parents. 'I felt like I was living on Mars all of a sudden," says Dana Lerner, 'like how is this possible? This makes absolutely no sense.'

The accident happened when Cooper and his father were coming home from dinner on January 10 at about 8:30pm.

Komlani turned left from 97th Street onto West End Avenue, striking both as they crossed the avenue.

Ramon Gonzalez was driving just behind the yellow cab and tried to save Cooper told the New York Daily News: 'He had to be distracted because there’s no way he could not see them, if I did.'

'The father grabbed his son. They were both on the hood of the car for a second. The father fell off the passenger side. The son went underneath the driver’s-side tire, first the front one, then the rear.'

His father, Dr. Richard Stock, a radiation oncologist suffered a minor leg injury

Gonzalez dialled 911 and an ambulance took Cooper to St. Luke’s Hospital, where he died.

His father, Dr. Richard Stock, a radiation oncologist whose patient list includes former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, suffered a minor leg injury.

On Thursday, the DA's office told Eyewitness News that the state law makes it much harder to prosecute fatal crashes as homicides even if the driver is at fault.

Dana Lerner is now pushing a new law in Cooper's name - to suspend cab drivers automatically if they seriously hit a pedestrian, until an investigation clears them of any wrongdoing.

'If a life is saved because of my son, that is the best thing I can have,' she said.

'It keeps him alive and gives him a legacy.'

Lerner told the New York Post that she struggles when leaving her apartment as want to pass the place less than a block away where her son was killed.

'If I have to go out that way, I cover my eyes. I can’t look there. When I do, I see what I saw that night . . . which was this stillness about him,' she said.

Earlier this year in a letter to family and friends, the family had expressed sympathy for Komlani.

'We cannot even find in our hearts at this time to feel anger toward the cab driver, who we know must be suffering too,' the family said in a letter to friends.

'It would give some meaning to this senseless nightmare if it serves as a reminder to people to drive extra carefully and give extra hugs to their children.'
