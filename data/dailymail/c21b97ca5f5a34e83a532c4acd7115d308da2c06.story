A police officer has described the horrifying moment his colleague lost control of a patrol car and careered into a cyclist.

Jurors were told that British Transport Police Pc David Lynch, 31, was driving ‘dangerously’ at more than twice the speed limit when his van hit talented musician Joseph Belmonte, leaving him seriously injured.

The court heard he was driving the marked police vehicle at speeds of up to 68mph in a 30mph zone as it approached a hump-backed bridge in Hackney, east London.

On trial: Pc David Lynch, 31, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court, has previously admitted careless driving but denies the more serious charge of dangerous driving

Eyewitnesses described seeing the vehicle ‘taking off’ and all four of its wheels leaving the ground as it sped over the bridge before slamming into Mr Belmonte on March 31 last year.

Southwark Crown Court heard that Mr Belmonte, known as Pepe to his friends, was thrown on to the bonnet of the Mercedes Vito van before hitting a tree.

A statement from Pc Gary Thomas was read out in which he described how the police vehicle had its lights and sirens on as it responded to the incident it was going to at around 3.40pm.

As it approached the bridge which crosses Regent’s Canal he said it was not possible to see what was on the other side and whether there were any other road users or pedestrians beyond it.

He said: ‘I believe we were approaching the bridge too quickly as I couldn’t see over the bridge and whether there were any hazards on the other side.

‘I was about to tell Pc Lynch we were going too fast and needed to slow down but we were already going over the bridge.

‘I believe all four wheels of the vehicle left the ground and we landed heavily in the middle of the road.

‘It caused me to panic as I thought something could be coming towards us.’

Pc Thomas said he then became aware of a cyclist who was travelling in the same direction as the police van, around one metre away from the kerb.

His statement described a ‘loud bang’ as they hit him and he was thrown on to the bonnet and carried along until the van came to a halt and he was then propelled into a tree.

He went on: ‘The cyclist had no chance of avoiding impact with us as he was facing in a forward direction.’

Pc Thomas said he had gripped the handle of the door as it had sped along.

After calling for an ambulance and further police assistance, he went to Mr Belmonte, who was lying on the ground groaning with visible facial injuries.

Mr Belmonte remained in hospital for two weeks and has no recollection of the incident.

Lynch, of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, has previously admitted careless driving but denies the more serious charge of dangerous driving.

Mr Belmonte, 31, who was not wearing a helmet, was cycling to his girlfriend’s house in Newington Green and had travelled the route on many occasions before, the court heard.

Lynch and his passenger PcThomas were on their way to an incident in the Old Street area when the collision occurred on Queensbridge Road on what was a dry and bright sunny day.

Opening the case, prosecutor Sam Brown told jurors that Lynch had pleaded guilty to the careless driving charge.

He added: ‘Through that admission he accepts that his driving on this day in March fell below that of a competent and careful driver.

‘The prosecution however allege that his conduct amounts to more than careless driving but that of dangerous driving.

‘And what is alleged in this case is that the defendant’s driving was to fall far below the standard expected of a competent and careful driver and that it would be obvious to a careful and competent driver that driving in that way would be dangerous.

‘These allegations represent serious, avoidable and ultimately criminal failures by a police officer.’

Witness Kathleen Coyle, who was standing on the pavement nearby, said she heard the police van as it approached with its sirens blaring.

In a statement read out to the court, she described how the van lifted 18 inches above the ground as it went over the bridge, then landed heavily in the middle of the road and swerved left to avoid a traffic island in the middle.

She said: ‘It looked as though the driver lost control.

‘It swerved first towards the middle of the road and then in the other direction.’

She said she saw the cyclist end up ‘wrapped around a tree’.

She added: ‘He looked like a ragdoll. He looked like he was dead.’

A statement was also read out from Mr Belmonte.

He said he had no recollection of the incident as he was heavily sedated.

But he added that he was an experienced cyclist, was fully aware of the road at the time and did not have any headphones in.

Sergeant Paul Tydeman, a senior collision investigator with the north-east London road collision unit, said he attended the scene of the accident at 4.20pm that day.

He told jurors the police van had been travelling at 68mph as it approached the bridge but had then braked to 63mph as it went over it and reduced to 45mph as it hit Mr Belmonte.

He also pointed to evidence that the vehicle’s wheels had left the ground as it went over the bridge and said that two gauge marks in the road indicated where it had then scraped the ground as it came back down.

He said: ‘I’d say the driver was having to fight quite hard to control the vehicle at the point that contact was made with the cyclist.

‘Pc Lynch was responding to this call for assistance but in my opinion he misjudged the severity of the hazard that was presented by the bridge, approaching as he did at 68mph.

‘It was because of that speed he was unable to retain proper control of his vehicle as he approached the brow of the bridge.

‘It was while he was trying to keep or retain control of the vehicle that the collision occurred with Mr Belmonte.’

No details of singer-songwriter Mr Belmonte’s injuries were given in court.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
