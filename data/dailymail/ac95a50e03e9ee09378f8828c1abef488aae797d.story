Britain's oldest father of twins has spoken of his heartbreak after doctors diagnosed him with terminal cancer.

Richard Roden, 75, beat bladder cancer when he was originally diagnosed with the disease in 2011.

But he learned last month that the cancer has returned and is now incurable.

He has vowed that he will battle the 
disease for as long as he can so that he can spend time with his 
four-year-old twin girls and his two-year-old daughter.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I'd always been such a strong man and I thought I'd be around for a long time to see our babies grow up.

'Now I am battling cancer and may not be around as long as I'd hoped. Lisa is worried at the thought of having to bring up the children on her own.'

Richard made headlines back in 2009 after his now 28-year-old wife Lisa gave birth to Emily and Ruby.

The couple had met at an adult 
education centre in Walsall, West Midlands, in September 2005, and 
married after four years together.

As well as the twins they later had another child, Maddison, now aged two.

Mr Roden, a retired welder, told the Sunday Mirror how people used to assume that he was the twins' grandfather and that they didn't believe him when he tried to correct them.

Wife Lisa's family said that the pair's marriage wouldn't last, but she said that the pair proved all the doubters wrong.

Richard was originally diagnosed with bladder cancer when Maddison was just six months old after he suffered bleeding.

But rounds of grueling chemotherapy and surgery at Walsall Manor Hospital looked to have been successful, with Mr Roden initially beating the disease.

But the pair received the devastating news that he has four more tumours on his bladder last month.

Despite another operation on the tumours, doctors have told Mr Roden that this time the cancer is incurable, but they say they will treat him to prolong his life for as long as possible.

Mr Roden, who has ten other children from his previous marriages, has vowed to carry on being a good father for as long as possible in spite of the illness.
