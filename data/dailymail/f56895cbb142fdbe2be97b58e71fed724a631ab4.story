Though trains have wavered in and out of fashion over the past few decades, a bold plan seeks to relieve train traffic on the ever-crowed Northeast Corridor by building a new route –under the Long Island Sound.

Bullet trains would race between Boston and Washington and pass under the Atlantic Ocean estuary in an 18-mile underwater tunnel. 

But the construction would not come cheaply, at an estimated $151billion.

Expansion: Amtrak is looking into expanding on the Northeast Corridor, adding to its Acela fleet

Fast times: In a design by students at the University of Pennsylvania, new high speed tracks - seen in red - would be added to pre-existing routes on the Northeast Corridor

In a plan proposed by design students from the University of Pennsylvania in conjunction with Robert Yaro of the Regional Plan Association, students mapped out a design that would connect major cities along the Eastern Seaboard – including Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston – with a high-speed bullet train.

Students estimated the entire construction would cost around $100billion, with $20billion dedicated to the new segment connecting New York City and Hartford, Connecticut. 

Similarly, Amtrak’s plan, which was released in July, is for a $151billion expansion.

In either proposal, finances are a major concern. The rail company would need significant public and private funding to get the project on track.

Speaking with the New York Times this summer, Amtrak president and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said: ‘We can worry about where the money is coming from, but we need to have a plan in place so when it does, we’re ready.’

The students write in their proposition, entitled ‘Making High-Speed Rail Work the Northeast Megaregion,’ that the new high-speed rail tracks could cut existing travel times in half, making a commute between New York and Washington only one hour and 45 minutes.

Current route: Amtrak's Acela service passes from Washington to New York in less than three hours, but with the proposed route, that time would be just over an hour

A commute between New York City and Boston would be a little over three hours. 

As the Hartford Courant notes, the proposed plans has ‘at least a bit of bipartisan appeal,’

mentioning that faster train service along the Northeast Corridor would allow hundreds of thousands of passengers to travel more quickly and cheaply from city to city.

In fact, by 2040, ridership is expected to reach a staggering 43.5million annual riders.

Many high-speed rail propositions made by President Obama and Vice President Biden have been touted by conservatives in Congress that the plan was too costly.

Members of the GOP said in 2011 after they turned down the president’s $8billion bill that the busy Northeast Corridor was where the future of high-speed trains lay.

Last year alone, Amtrak transported 11million passengers along the corridor.

Commuter network: More and more people along the Eastern Seaboard are relying on fast trains; here, travellers are seen in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station

Big plans: Amtrak plans a $7billion expansion of D.C.'s Union Station, pictured, with the goal of making it a high-speed rail and commercial hub

Train spotting: People walk in front of the Amtrak departure board at New York's Penn Station; train service from Washington to New York would be cut in half by the new bullet trains

The feat to build an 18-mile tunnel under the Long Island Sound, while certainly an ambitious undertaking, does not make it the longest underwater tunnel.

That title belongs to the Channel Tunnel, which runs 31.4 miles under the English Channel.

Likewise, the Seikan Tunnel in Japan, which runs 33.5 miles, with a 14.5-mile segment under the sea bed, holds the record for the longest stretch of underground tunnel.

The Federal Railroad Administration has launched an intensive study on the corridor, examining the current route from Washington, D.C. to Boston.

Included in its study are the metropolitan regions around Washington, Baltimore, Wilmington, Philadelphia, New York, New Haven, Providence, and Boston.

The bullet trains, much like those in Europe and Asia, could skyrocket across tracks at speeds up to 220mph.

Record holder: The Channel Tunnel holds the record for longest underwater tunnel at 31.4 miles of track
