Colonel Gaddafi’s wife and three of his children have fled to Algeria after a dramatic escape across the desert to avoid rebel forces.

Safiya Gaddafi, her sons Mohammed and Hannibal and daughter Ayesha were smuggled out in a cloak-and-dagger operation, arriving yesterday morning.

Algerian authorities refused to reveal if the dictator was with his family, sparking furious accusations that they had allowed the ‘Mad Dog’ of Libya to escape justice.

However the Italian news agency ANSA said that Gaddafi and his sons Saadi and Saif al-Islam were in the town of Bani Walid south of Tripoli.

It cited ‘authoritative Libyan diplomatic sources’ which also confirmed the Algerian development.

The foreign ministry in Algiers previously denied reports that a motorcade of six armoured Mercedes cars had entered the country.

It is now believed those vehicles contained Gaddafi’s wife with Mohammed, 41, Hannibal, 35, Ayesha, 34, plus their partners and children.

They left Tripoli on Sunday afternoon and would have had to dodge rebel patrols to reach the safety of the Algerian border at least 300 miles away.

They finally arrived – according to Algerian authorities – at 8.45am yesterday.

Gaddafi’s youngest son, Khamis, 28, 
was not amongst the escapees, and there were reports yesterday he may 
have been killed in a Nato air attack.

Rebel
 leaders in Tripoli immediately accused the Algerians of supporting the 
ousted regime and said sheltering the Gaddafi family was an ‘act of 
aggression’ against the new Libyan government.

The
 rebel-led National Transitional Council (NTC) said it would try to 
extradite any Gaddafi relatives from its North African neighbour.

Algerian
 Foreign Minister Amar Belan said in a statement that his country had 
adhered to a policy of ‘strict neutrality’ throughout the Libya crisis 
and respects ‘the decision of every person under its sovereignty’.

He added that Algeria has no intention to ‘interfere in any manner whatsoever in the internal affairs’ of Libya.

The NTC’s military spokesman Ahmed Bani said he  was unsurprised to hear Algeria had welcomed Gaddafi relatives.

Rebels
 have previously accused Algiers of providing the dictator with 
thousands of mercenaries in his battle to halt the revolution.

Reports from the front line suggested Khamis Gaddafi was dead.

Sky
 News reported that a man claiming to be Khamis’s bodyguard said he was 
in a Toyota Land Cruiser which was hit by a missile fired from a Nato 
Apache helicopter.

Separately,
 a rebel official said the rebels had ‘almost confirmed’ Khamis’s death 
in fighting on August 27 near Tarhuna, 50 miles southeast of Tripoli.

Khamis, a Russian-trained military officer, commanded an elite battalion dedicated to protecting his father.

Earlier
 reports that rebels had captured three of Gaddafi’s sons proved to be 
false. His heir apparent Saif al-Islam was among those said to have been
 captured, only to emerge on state television on the streets of Tripoli.

Rebels
 say they want to take Colonel Gaddafi alive so he can face a trial in 
Libya. The International Criminal Court has said it also wants him to 
face justice there for war crimes.
