Jane Bartholomew, 39, was discovered at her house. Scott Ellis, 42, was later arrested on suspicion of murder at Ipswich Hospital where he was being treated for injuries to his wrists

The body of a 39-year-old mother was found by police after a neighbour raised the alarm because her family was worried about her.

Jane Bartholomew was discovered at her house in Martlesham Heath near Ipswich, Suffolk, on Friday night.

A post-mortem by a Home Office pathologist confirmed she had died of 'significant head injuries'.

Scott Ellis, 42, was later arrested on suspicion of murder at Ipswich Hospital where he was being treated for injuries to his wrists.

He was charged last night after being questioned at the Suffolk Police Investigation Centre in Martlesham, around a mile from Ms Bartholomew's home. He will appear before Ipswich magistrates tomorrow.

Ellis was earlier found injured at 6.35pm on Friday at his home in Tunstall near Woodbridge, Suffolk.

He lived at the modern detached house in a cul-de-sac with his mother Josephine Ellis, 63, who was widowed around four-years-ago.

Suffolk Police said officers had gone to the house after being told that paramedics were treating a man at the address for injuries to his wrists.

Ms Bartholomew's home and a garage area at the rear was cordoned off by police yesterday while scenes of crime officers searched for forensic clues.

It is believed the woman’s parents live in the U.S, and she has three young daughters.

One man, who did not wish to be named, told the Ipswich Star: 'Very friendly, always laughing, always said hello to us. I just saw her about a week ago and she was ever so friendly.'

He added: 'It’s ridiculous. It’s horrible, terrible. Of course her parents are in America, they’ll have to come back. You can’t think about it, it’s horrible.'

Another neighbour said: 'I know a mother lived there. I think she had children. We heard a big bang during the evening and it must have been the police breaking in.'

Forensic officers were also gathering possible evidence from the home of Mr Ellis ten miles away in Tunstall.

A grey Seat Leon car parked outside the house and is believed to belong to him was also being examined.

Police are asking anyone with information to contact them on 101 quoting CAD 503 of 13/6/14 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
