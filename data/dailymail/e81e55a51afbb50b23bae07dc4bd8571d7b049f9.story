Outside the simple apartment building where the Democratic Republic of Congo are staying, the team's warm-up bibs are hanging out on a fence to dry. Inside, a kit man is ironing Cup of Nations badges onto the sleeves of each shirt.

It is a long way from the fancy hotels and perfect preparation of the Premier League. But upstairs one of the top flight's rising stars is doing his best to cope with the testing conditions of Ebebiyin, a tiny jungle town in north eastern Equatorial Guinea.

'When we came, there was no TV and only cold water,' says Yannick Bolasie, the Crystal Palace winger who is fast making a name for himself as one of Africa's finest players.

'The internet wasn't set up until two hours later, and there's never enough food. They have to serve us at the buffet, otherwise they'd run out before the staff have eaten, and the portions are tiny. I'm getting up in the morning crazy hungry.'

It could have been worse. Several teams have had to move hotels amid the hastily planned tournament, and Monday's opponents Tunisia arrived at their base to find no electricity, running water, soap, bed sheets or towels.

'I guess we weren't that bad off then,' laughs Bolasie. 'Because I thought we were having a terrible time until I heard the other stories.'

Ebebiyin is about as far as you can imagine from where Bolasie hopes to end up – at the pinnacle of European football.

'It's any player's dream to play in the Champions League,' he says. 'I think it's normal, and for myself I want to be at that level. If I get a chance to take the step up, I'd like to.'

That might ring alarm bells for Crystal Palace fans and their new manager Alan Pardew, but with the form Bolasie is showing it can only be a matter of time before one of the big boys come knocking, especially if his game continues to develop at its current rate.

It is only six years since the Congolese star was playing for Hibernians in Malta, a chance he took because it meant the opportunity to play full time. From there he turned down a contract at Sturm Graz to sign for Plymouth, going out on loan twice before moving to Bristol City, and then on to Palace.

'The journey has made me stronger as a person and a footballer, because I didn't have it all my way,' he explains. 'I had to go out on loan to the Conference, League Two, then come back and play. Then we got relegated, so I had to play in League One to try and get back in the Championship. I learned a lot.'

Just when he was starting to make a name for himself two years ago, the Cup of Nations came around, leaving the winger a difficult decision – stay and keep up the momentum, or represent the country of his parents' birth. In the end he chose the former, helping Palace win promotion.

The timing is less than perfect this time around too. Three weeks ago, Bolasie's fiancé gave birth to their second child, just before the player had to leave for the tournament.

'It's been very hard,' he admits. 'I'm going to go back and she might not even know me.'

On top of the personal upheaval, it's also not an ideal time to leave for footballing reasons, with a new manager in place.

'He's a top manager,' says Bolasie of Pardew. 'He's not come from being sacked, he's come from another team. I think he's been aware of me for a while because his assistant at Newcastle, John Carver, worked with me at Plymouth.'

But after three wins in Pardew's first three games, Bolasie admits his team-mates have been messaging him suggesting he might struggle to get back in the team.

'It's going to be interesting,' he laughs. 'I guess, when everyone's doing well, that's when you leave it to the manager.'

Such is Bolasie's form, both at home and here in West Africa, that dropping him seems a remote possibility. Congo's left winger was undisputedly the man of the match in the first game against Zambia, and despite a disappointing performance against Cape Verde, is unquestionably his side's star man, and their only goalscorer so far in Equatorial Guinea.

The curling effort from the edge of the box on Monday took his international goals this season ahead of his club tally, and it's something the player knows he has to work on.

'The only thing people are saying right now is that I don't score enough goals. But I'm pretty confident that's going to come, and when it comes it's going to be really interesting.'

Things could have been very different for Bolasie, who was eligible to play for both England and France, but instead picked Congo two years ago. Had he waited, his domestic form this season might well have led to a call up from Roy Hodgson.

'England are like that,' he reflects. 'I think there's a lot of people that get called up.'

'At the time I remember Wilfried [Zaha] getting called for the England team, and I did think it could be possible. But I thought, 'I can do something for Congo, something a bit special.'

That special something could be achieved in the next few weeks. The Leopards haven't won a Cup of Nations since 1974, but a win against Tunisia on Monday night would take them into the knock-out stages, and they have a squad capable of progressing further.

'Getting out of the group was always the target,' says Bolasie. 'Then anything can happen. The way the tournament's looking, it's really tight, anyone can go through, and if some of the bigger teams don't qualify then anyone can win it.'

If Bolasie can lead his team to victory, he will confirm his status as a new legend of African football.

Bolasie's teammates have joked that he will struggle to get back into the team following Pardew's arrival
