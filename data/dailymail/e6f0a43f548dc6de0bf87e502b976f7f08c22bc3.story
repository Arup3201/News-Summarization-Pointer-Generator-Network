Guests at a theme park hotel in Japan will be checked in and have their luggage delivered to their room by robots as well as use their faces to access their rooms. 

Henn-na Hotel at the  Huis Ten Bosch theme park is situated just outside Nagasaki, and will be offering cutting edge technology that could set a precedent for the future.

Interestingly, the Japanese word 'henn' translates into English as change. 

Robots, or androids, will check in guests at the Henn-na theme park hotel in Japan

It is believed 10 robot staff will be sourced for jobs within the hotel, ranging from check-in to room cleaning.

The hotel will offer guests the choice between using traditional hotel keys or face recognition to open their rooms.

The robots are from the company that licenses Hello Kitty.

The Japan Times reported company president Hideo Sawada as saying: 'We will make the most efficient hotel in the world. 

'In the future, we'd like to have more than 90 percent of hotel services operated by robots.'

And surprisingly the chance to see a whole new world of hotel service comes at a reasonable price.

With lower staff costs due to using robots, rooms will become more affordable at the theme park hotel

The robots will also be used to clean guests' rooms as well as deliver up their luggage

A single room will cost around £40 (7,000 Japanese Yen) while a twin room will come in at £50 (9,000 Japanese Yen).

However, with the expected interest, especially in peak season, set to book out the hotel, guests will be invited to 'bid' for a spot in the venue.

But bidding for a single room will be capped at around £80 (14,000 Japanese Yen).

There is expected to be a great deal of interest in rooms at the tech-savvy hotel, so guests will have to bid for a place especially in peak season

Due to the operating costs being lower, prices in the Henn-na Hotel will be lower than the other hotels there

That's still some way behind the prices of the other hotels in the theme park, but this has been offset against the use of solar panels, lower staff rates and other power-saving equipment. 

July has been pencilled in as to when the first building containing 72 rooms will be opening, with plans for a second wing already being discussed.

The theme park is modelled in typical Dutch style in terms of its architecture and framework giving visitors a taste of the Netherlands.
