Police forces across the country will investigate officers for dealing with criminals to buy steroids and abusing their power for sex, a chief constable said today.

Mike Cunningham said the top risk factors for corruption of police officers are inappropriate relationships -  including to buy bodybuilding drugs, abuse of power for sexual gratification and misuse of information systems.

He said most forces across the country will be running investigations into officers who associate with criminals to get steroids, or use their position to sleep with people.

The Chief Constable of Staffordshire was speaking as the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) published a report on how to tackle corruption.

He said: 'We do our own assessment of corruption threats, one of them is steroid abuse and gym use by officers.

'What that starts off is very often officers going to the gyms, beginning to dabble in steroids, then the relationships they form when they’re using steroids become corrupt and corrosive.

'There is good evidence of officers getting way out of their depth with serious criminals who they are beholden to.'

He said that dozens of officers across the country are caught up in this kind of situation.

'We do know that most forces would be investigating an issue which relates to an officer with steroid abuse,' he said.

'In most forces there will be a police officer who is into bodybuilding and the gym and who would abuse steroids.

'There would be an investigation in most professional standards departments in the country in relation to an allegation of steroid abuse.'

Abuse of power for sex is also occurring across forces in England and Wales.

Mr Cunningham said: 'We found that when we asked force professional standards departments that again most forces were investigating allegations against individual officers abusing their position for sexual favour.'

Chief constables will discuss plans later this week on how to tackle allegations of corruption.

Plans under discussion include making details of gross misconduct hearings public, and revealing the details of chief constables’ pay packets and the extra perks they might receive.

Officers could also be made to wait for a cooling-off period before leaving the service and taking a job at a private company.

Ethics committees could also be set up to monitor each force, independently of the police and crime commissioner.
