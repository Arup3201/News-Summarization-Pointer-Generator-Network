A former MI6 spy is being investigated by police on suspicion of defrauding a woman involved in one of the most costly and toxic divorce cases in British legal history. 

Michelle Young, 50, fought her ex-husband Scot, for eight years through 65 separate court hearings, at a cost to her of £6.5million, to try and secure a share of his fortune which she claimed exceeded £770million.

Mr Young, a former property and telecoms tycoon, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle with his former wife but said he lost his entire fortune in a disastrous property deal that left him £28million in debt. 

At the conclusion of Michelle and Scot Young's marathon divorce case, she was awarded £20m

The couple once socialised in a super-wealthy league that included Sir Philip Green, Simon Cowell and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. 

As their relationship was played out in court it was claimed Mr Young spent up to £5,000 a night eating out, that they went to a Raymond Blanc restaurant twice a week, that Mr Young paid up to £4million for 'a flash gin-palace, Sunseeker-type boat' and she had jewellery which Mr Young said cost a million pounds.

It was also said that they went on three to four foreign holidays a year, staying in villas and presidential suites.

The couple were married in 1995 but it resulted in one of the most toxic and bitter divorces battles

But the tycoon's empire went into meltdown and he was declared bankrupt in 2010 and last year, after repeatedly refusing to produce financial documents, was jailed for six months for contempt of court. Ms Young maintains that he has squirrelled his assets offshore.

In the end, the judge, Mr Justice Moor, agreed with her that 'he is not a penniless man of straw'. 

He decreed that Scot had a net fortune of £40 million and should therefore give Ms Young £20million.

However one year on, she has yet to receive a penny and continues to fight for it. As such, she was forced to draw on the help of outside agencies to enforce her judgement order. 

Ms Young has yet to receive any of the money she was awarded and so paid £14,000 for information on her ex husband from Mark-Hill Wood, who worked for 25 years for GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service

She was contacted in July by Mark Hill-Wood, who worked for 25 years for GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service before setting up his own private detective agency, Full-Proof Intelligence. 

His LinkedIn page describes him as a 'highly respected operative who formerly worked in the Intelligence Services' and he specialises in cyber investigations, firearms training and 'suspect interrogation.' 

According to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Hill-Wood told Ms Young that he had come across some of her former husband's hidden wealth in a Swiss bank account while working on an assignment in Russia.

He therefore persuaded Ms Young to pay him £14,000 for the information, which she managed to raise through one of her previous litigation funders. 

Ms Young - who says she cannot work because running her legal case is a full-time job - is currently surviving on benefits to support her two daughters, Scarlet and Sasha. 

At one point Ms Young begged Mr Hill-Wood to hand over the information he claimed to have regarding her ex husband's hidden wealth in a Swiss bank account, saying 'I feel like crying, I'm under so much pressure' 

Mr Hill-Wood, who attended Marlborough College and Oxford University, said he would travel to Russia himself to recover the documentary evidence. 

However, suspicions were raised when another employee of FullProof Intelligence emailed Ms Young to say Mr Hill-Wood had been captured by the Russian authorities who were going to hold him until another £15,000 was raised.

Ms Young refused and Mr Hill-Wood eventually emailed to say he had been released. 

By the end of July, Mr Hill-Wood claimed he had returned to the UK with 'two lever-arch files' of material that supposedly detailed Mr Young's offshore wealth.

However he repeatedly cancelled meetings with her and her QC where he was supposed to hand it over. At one point, Ms Young emailed, begging him to hand it over, saying: 'I feel like crying, I'm under so much pressure.'

However, the information never materialised and eventually Ms Young reported Mr Hill-Wood to the police. 

A senior Surrey Police source confirmed an investigation into alleged fraud was under way, but refused to comment, citing operational reasons. 

The divorce battle between Michelle and Scot Young was one of the most high profile in British legal history
