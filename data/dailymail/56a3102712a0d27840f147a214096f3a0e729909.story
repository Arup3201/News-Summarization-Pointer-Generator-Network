Baron Hill of Oareford, Britain's EU Commissioner, will take charge of EU financial services regulation

David Cameron secured a rare victory in Europe today after Britain’s Brussels commissioner was given a top finance job.

The Prime Minster had been bracing himself for a fresh snub, amid suggestions that former House of Lords leader Christopher Hill would be handed a junior role in the European Commission.

But the European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker this morning announced that Lord Hill would be given a new ‘Financial Services’ portfolio – giving him key powers to protect the City of London from Brussels regulations.

The Tory peer was put forward by the Prime Minister to serve on Mr Juncker's new European Commission earlier this summer.

But it was feared Britain would miss out on an economic role because the commission president - whose appointment was fiercely resisted by Mr Cameron - had indicated he wanted a woman to be Britain's top representative in Brussels.

Mr Juncker, announcing his Commission team this morning, said: "In these unprecedented times, Europe's citizens expect us to deliver.

‘After years of economic hardship and often painful reforms, Europeans expect a performing economy, sustainable jobs, more social protection, safer borders, energy security and digital opportunities.

‘Today I am presenting the team that will put Europe back on the path to jobs and growth.’

The new ‘Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union’ portfolio run by Lord Hill will be in charge of introducing new regulation for European banks.

Ministers will hope to use Lord Hill’s influence in Brussels to limit the amount of EU regulation over Britain’s financial services industry.

Mr Juncker wrote to Lord Hill to announce his new position.

He said: 'You are becoming a Member of the new European Commission at a particularly challenging time for the European Union.

'With the start of the new Commission, we have an exceptional opportunity, but also an obligation, to make a fresh start, to address the difficult geo-political situation, to strengthen economic recovery and to build a Europe that delivers jobs and growth for its citizens.

'I want the new Commission to be a strong and political team. And I want you, with your political skills and experience, to fully play your part in this team.’

He added: 'Following our recent discussions, I would like you to be the Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union.

'In this mission letter, I set out what I expect from you as a Member of the Commission as well as specific goals for which you will be responsible for reaching during our mandate.'

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker received  David Cameron at the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, with a high five in July - despite the PM trying to block him getting the job

Chancellor George Osborne claimed Lord Hill's appointment was 'great news' for Britain.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘Look forward to working with Lord Hill, EU financial services commissioner, to build safer & more competitive sector. Great news for UK.’

Downing Street also welcomed the announcement. The PM's spokesman said: ‘We welcome president-designate Juncker's announcement of the new European Commission-designate.

‘We have made the case for an economic portfolio for Lord Hill and I think that is what we have seen in today's announcement.

‘What we see here - unlike in the previous Commission - is a stand-alone financial services portfolio that also brings with it elements of financial stability that were previously in another portfolio. It will be this portfolio that is looking at financial services issues in the single market, but also issues such as banking union, which have always been thought of as having particular relevance to the eurozone.

‘We are seeing that being led by a Commissioner from a non-euro member-state. I think that speaks to the point that the Prime Minister and others have been making about the importance, as we go ahead with reform of the EU, of ensuring that the voice of countries that are not in euro and will not join the euro - such as the UK - are fully represented.’

But Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘What a coup for Juncker - he has got an Englishman to be hangman for the British financial industry, a huge contributor to our national tax revenue.

‘Mr Cameron transferred control of Britain's financial services industry - our biggest industry - to the European Union in 2010. That process has now been completed by the appointment of a British commissioner to make sure that everything is done on an EU level.

‘It is vital to note that Lord Hill will not be acting in the interests of the British Government or the British people; he will be making a solemn pledge to act in the interests of the European Union.’
