Hearts remain unbeaten at the top of the Scottish Championship after earning a 1-1 draw against Edinburgh rivals Hibernian.

The Jambos' impressive league record appeared to be in danger when Jason Cummings fired the visitors into the lead midway through the first half.

But his ninth goal of the season was cancelled out in style by Jamie Walker who grabbed a superb equaliser to ensure the derby clash ended all square.

The outcome at Tynecastle means Hearts have still not lost a league match this season after 19 games.

Unsurprisingly, Hibs named an unchanged side following their emphatic 4-0 win over Rangers, with Martin Boyle on the bench after joining on loan from Dundee.

Hearts made two changes from the side who defeated Livingston, with Miguel Pallardo and Walker both drafted into the starting line-up.

The visitors almost snatched the opener within seconds of kick-off amid a raucous atmosphere inside the Gorgie ground.

A poor ball from Alim Ozturk was pounced on by Cummings but his 20-yard shot was straight at Neil Alexander and comfortably blocked by the Hearts goalkeeper.

Hibs were threatening again when they were handed a free-kick after Scott Allan was fouled by Morgaro Gomis.

Liam Craig's low effort took an awkward deflection but Alexander did well to get down and smother.

Hearts were not too far away when Walker picked out Danny Wilson from a corner and the skipper nodded just wide of the upright.

But it was Hibs who sparked wild celebrations among the travelling support when they surged into the lead in the 24th minute.

A lovely cross from Allan from the right picked out Cummings at the back post and he slotted home his third goal in as many games.

Cummings then almost helped himself to another moments later, collecting unmarked from Lewis Stevenson only to nod just past the post.

Hearts tried to haul themselves back into the game but Walker succeeded only in smashing his shot into the side-netting.

However, he was celebrating five minutes before half-time thanks to a fantastic ferocious strike from 25 yards into the top corner that left goalkeeper Mark Oxley with no chance.

Buoyed by the leveller, the home side could have edged in front shortly after the restart but Adam Eckersley failed to keep his close-range header on target.

Hibs fans then screamed for a penalty when Danny Handling went to ground under pressure from Pallardo but there was no spot-kick award from referee Steven McLean.

Moments later, it was Hearts' turn to appeal, with Gomis and Walker both hitting the turf in quick succession but, again, the match official declined to point to the spot.

Boyle was thrown into the action for his debut with seven minutes to go but it was fellow sub Callum Booth who was denied a late winner when his volley was cleared off the line by Callum Paterson.
