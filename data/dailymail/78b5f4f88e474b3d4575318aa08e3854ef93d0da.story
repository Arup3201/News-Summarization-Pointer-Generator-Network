Robin van Persie left Holland's training camp with his left thigh taped up after their hour long session in Rio today.

The Manchester United forward, who is crucial to Louis van Gaal's hopes of winning the country's first World Cup, was heavily taped up around his left thigh as he left their Flamengo training base. 

Holland play Costa Rica in Salvador in the quarter-final on Saturday and need van Persie to be fit.

Arjen Robben did not complete yesterday's session and instead completed some stretching exercises on the sidelines.

One
 of Robben's exercises included speed resistance training in what 
appeared to be a novel way to stop the flying forward going to ground.

The
 30-year-old has scored three goals already in the tournament and Van 
Gaal will be hoping to let him off the leash once again at the Arena 
Fonte Nova.

After
 dramatically progressing past Mexico 2-1, thanks to two late goals, the 
Dutch looked relaxed in training ahead of their quarter-final clash 
against Los Ticos before the injury scare to Van Persie.

In
 their last 16 dramatic win against Mexico, Robben admitted to diving 
during the game in which he earned his side the winning penalty in 
theatrical fashion.

With van Persie a doubt, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar could be given his first start of the tournament.

The
 Schalke striker featured as a second-half substitute against Mexico, 
making just seven touches in the match which included producing an 
assist and the winning goal from the spot.

Injured midfield Nigel De Jong began his rehabilitation as the Dutch trained at the Flamenco Football Stadium in Rio.

Holland’s
 official twitter account announced that the AC Milan midfielder would 
be out for two to four weeks after sustaining a groin injury, but it 
could be sooner as he steps up his recovery.

On the ball: Wesley Sneijder will be hoping to weave his through the Costa Rica defence on Saturday

Out on their feet: Holland are one of the favourites to win the World Cup having scored 12 goals so far

Fighting fit? Nigel de Jong could return for Holland sooner than expected at the World Cup from his groin injury
