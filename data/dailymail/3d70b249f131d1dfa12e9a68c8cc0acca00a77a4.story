A British man has been sentenced to 20 years jail in Peru for pushing his pregnant girlfriend to her death from their home after a Valentines Day row.

Financial trader Owen Arthur Goddard, 35, was convicted on a single charge of femicide by a court in the capital Lima.

Part-time dental assistant Lidia Maribel Mendoza Riquez, who was nearly four months pregnant with their child, died in the early hours of February 14 2012 after falling near 30 feet from the third-floor flat they shared in upmarket Lima neighbourhood San Isidro.

Goddard survived despite throwing himself from the same apartment in an apparent suicide attempt.Detectives found the pair lying side by side by a wooden fence near the block when they arrived.

Local TV stations later showed grisly pictures of the injured Brit lying unconscious in hospital taken on a mobile phone.

Police
 initially treated the incident as an alcohol-fuelled accident but soon 
started to suspect foul play after neighbours said they had heard the 
pair rowing shortly before the tragedy and they discovered his victim 
had reported him for assault months earlier.

Prosecutors, who had demanded a 30-year jail sentence, are now expected to appeal.

He was charged with his girlfriend's murder after coming out of a coma and dubbed the 'English killer' by local papers.

Lidia's sister Flor claimed at the time her pregnancy and Goddard's increasing reliance on drugs had led to her death.

She said: 'That man pushed her because he didn't want to have the baby.

'He threw himself on top of her afterwards to make it look like an accident.'

The
 three judges who decided Goddard's fate after a stop-start trial which 
began last September ruled in a written judgement the Brit expat was 
'conscious of his actions' and suffered from no psychological problems.

He was ordered to pay his victim's family more than £42,000 in compensation.

Prosecutors,
 who had demanded a 30-year jail sentence and more than double the 
amount of compensation he was ordered to pay, have already said they 
will appeal.

In a 
separate move judges also ruled a male friend who was with Goddard and 
his girlfriend in the flat when the incident occurred, should face 
further investigation over claims he may have acted as an accomplice.

The unnamed friend told police at the time he saw nothing and could not help them with their inquiries.
