Kell Brook is giving Amir Khan 48 hours to commit to a Battle of Britain at Wembley Stadium on June 13, or else he will find another big name to be given the Special K treatment this summer.

Khan says sorry but he will be fighting in America next month, although he will oblige Brook in due course.

Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn does not believe Khan is scared of his man but said: ‘Amir’s family are not certain he would win the fight and realise that if he were to lose it would be game over for their boy.’

Kell Brook celebrates after beating Jo Jo Dan during their IBF World Welterweight Title Fight in Sheffield

There was a whiff of Mayweather-Pacquiao in the Saturday night air in Sheffield after Brook flexed the vivid scar in his left leg and vexed his six months of anxiety since that machete attack on an inadequate challenger for his IBF world welterweight title.

By keeping the world waiting for five years, the Money Man and the PacMan have built their rivalry into a half-a-billion-dollar bonanza in Las Vegas on May 2.

By keeping the United Kingdom on tenterhooks for another 12 months, Brook and Khan can crank up the ante way beyond what Hearn describes as ‘the biggest pay-day of their lives.’

Brook has called out Amir Khan for the 'Battle of Britain' and gave the boxer 48 hours to commit

Just so long as neither of them is beaten in the interim.

That risk will be difficult to evaluate until they each identify their next opponent.

Brook is going to Vegas to celebrate his 29th birthday by watching Floyd and Manny contest - the richest fight of all time. He will throw down the gauntlet to the winner but has more realistic alternatives.

They include Mexican legend Juan Manuel Marquez in front of 40,000 of Brook’s neighbours at Sheffield United’s Brammall Lane football ground or Tex-Mex slugger Brandon Rios in the Manchester Arena or London’s 02.

Khan is hoping to announce a foe for somewhere in America sometime next month. Ideally Puerto Rican icon Miguel Cotto at catch-weight, maybe controversial Adrien Broner, or the less compelling recent Pacquiao victim Chris Algieri.

In truth – impressively though Brook proved his full recovery from that bizarre machete attack in Tenerife six months ago – any of the above would provide sterner opposition than the Canada-based Romanian he employed as a punch-bag in the Motorpoint Arena this weekend.

The welterweight knocked Dan around the ring like a rag doll and wants a big one against Khan

Jo Jo Dan became Yo Yo Dan as he went down and up four times in the four one-sided rounds which ended in the inevitable stoppage.

As a homecoming party for Brook after winning his world title in the US then almost losing his life in that deeply scarring assault, it was fun for all concerned except the hapless gent in the other corner.

Desperate Dan reeled around like a drunk as Special K had him for breakfast, lunch and dinner at one sitting.

Brook sends Dan flying for a third time and then knocked him down a fourth before it was stopped

Brook’s first right-hander wobbled him. More of the same dropped him in the second round. He somehow stayed upright in the third but the punishment was unrelenting and down he went twice more in the fourth.

The final knock-down came a split-second before what proved to be the final bell. American referee Earl Brown conducted the required standing eight-count before ushering Dan into his corner and then refusing him permission to come out again.

Not Brook’s fault since this was his mandatory challenger and he was right to point out that Dan had not been stopped before.

Wembley Stadium has been booked for the fight by Eddie Hearn but its remains to be seen if Khan accepts

Although that does beg serious questions of the IBF rankings procedures.

Dan reeled around like a drunk in the ring and it is arguable that Brook might have found a tougher rival in the pub round the corner.

Brook now rates himself up there with Mayweather, Pacquiao and Khan among welterweight royalty. Hearn concurred with that opinion, saying: ‘When Kell first came to me his father told me he would beat Mayweather one day. Now he is just one more big win away from fighting Floyd.’

That victory will be easier to realise than the super fight in Vegas, since anything other than an anti-climax on May 2 seems certain to result in a second-fortune rematch for Mayweather and Pacquiao in the autumn.

Dan had no answer to the power and speed of Brook whose recovered well from his stabbing

But against whom?

Marquez is easing his ruptured knee back into training but is not certain to box again and will be expensive to bring to Sheffield if he does.

So the greater likelihood is Rios.

Brook and his towns-folk would prefer it to be his fellow Brit. When he took the microphone to ask who they wanted him to beat next, the packed crowd roared: ‘Khan, Khan, Khan.’

Hearn would love that, too, and he believes it is also what the British fight fans desire. But he says: ‘If we don’t start talking for real in the next couple of days it will be too late for June 13. And I’m not expecting my phone to ring within 48 hours. They have already said that our fight will happen – but not next.’

Brook can rest easy on his world title and a left leg repaired by nuclear medicine.

Having done all that was required of him to stay unbeaten all he needs to do now to bring the big bucks rolling in is stay out of trouble.
