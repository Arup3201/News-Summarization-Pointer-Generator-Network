A young couple and their four-month-old baby have disappeared from their home in a small town leaving their belongings behind, authorities said.

Timothy Medsker, 33, wife Sabrina, 34, and baby son Joshua have not been seen since February 12 in Petoskey, Michigan.

Mr Medsker runs a successful cleaning business in the town and was known to work 70 to 80 hours a week. He had failed to show up for client meetings on February 16.

Mystery: Timothy Medsker, wife Sabrina and four-month-old son Joshua haven't been seen in their home town of Petoskey, Michigan since February 12

Such behavior was extremely out of character for Mr Medsker as he was never late and did not miss work appointments.

Petoskey Director of Public Safety John Calabrese told MailOnline that the case 'is very frustrating and the family is obviously very concerned'.

Director Calabrese said it appeared that the family had left home in a hurry when their residence was investigated for clues of their disappearance.

Although the new parents have not been in contact with anyone they know, there was no evidence of foul play and their silver Ford pick-up truck was also missing. 

'There's not a whole lot we can do because as far as we know at this point, there has been no crime committed,' he told MailOnline.

Relatives reported the family missing on February 23 after being contacted by concerned customers. The Medskers, who were described as 'very private', reportedly have family in Orlando, Florida.

The family also has connections in Chicago and Gary, Indiana. At one time, the Medskeys may have lived in Arizona or Florida.

'We need Tim and Sabrina to contact their family,' Mr Calabrese said.

The town of Petoskey has a population of around 6,000 and sits on the northeast shore of Lake Michigan.

Mr Calabrese told The Orlando Sentinel that 'It looks like they left in a hurry,'  noting the family did leave behind some belongings in their home.'

'Nobody knows where they're at.'

'It appears the family left the Petoskey area by choice, however, family members and friends are requesting the public's help in locating them,'
