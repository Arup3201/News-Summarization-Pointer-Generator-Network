Death: Adam Cullen is believed to have accidentally hanged himself by his hoodie in a 'rare' incident

A 17-year-old boy accidentally hanged himself by his hoodie in a ‘rare and freakish’ incident, an inquest has heard.

Adam Cullen is believed to have died within seconds after the bow he had tied on the drawstring on his hooded top caught on a latch of his rear garden gate.

The teenager’s family found his lifeless body outside his home in Beeston, Nottingham, and his death was said to have left an ‘enormous gaping hole’ in the lives of everyone he knew.

Adam was a ‘very happy and fulfilled young man’ and there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death, Nottingham Coroner’s Court was told yesterday.

The talented photographer was wearing a sports hoodie with lacy-type threading and had been suffering from a stomach bug.

Detective Inspector Elizabeth Rogers, who investigated the incident for Nottinghamshire Police, said it was a ‘tragic accident’.

She added: ‘The fashion is currently to have [the hoodie strings] tied in a bow at the neck. Adam and his friends were all wearing their hoodies like that.’

Nottinghamshire Coroner Mairin Casey said: ‘What appears to have happened is that after he had entered the gate of this property, he’s either tripped or - because he was unwell - fainted in some way.

‘In the most rare and freakish event the string of his hoodie caught the latch of quite a high gate, which is about six or seven feet tall.’

A post-mortem examination found he died on February 6 by asphyxiation, caused by hanging.

Adam - described as an 'exceptional' roller skater - was a student at Bramcote College, where flowers, pictures and personal tributes were left after his death.

Miss Casey, recording a verdict of accidental death, said: ‘This is a most unusual situation and probably even more especially tragic on account of this. He was a popular, healthy and happy young man with a fulfilled life, close family and very close friends.

‘His death has left an enormous gaping hole in his community and school environment - all have expressed positive feelings and memories about Adam.'

Remembered: Adam, described as a talented inline-skater, was a student at Bramcote College in Nottingham, where flowers, pictures and personal tributes were left after his death last month (above)

Adam - who was the son of Jim, 71, and Trish Cullen, 55 - previously attended Beeston Fields Primary School and Alderman White School. He was due to finish college this summer.

Bramcote College headteacher Paul Heery said: ‘He was clearly a boy of many talents. In particular he was an exceptional roller skater who had a reputation for excellence that had spread far and wide, and a keen and talented photographer who had built up an impressive portfolio of work.

‘However, as well as this, he was funny, generous, and a true and loyal friend. Everyone who knew him spoke of the pleasure he brought to those around him and how he lit up every group he joined, and everyone is conscious of the empty space that he leaves behind.’
