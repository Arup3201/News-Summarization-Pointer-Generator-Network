Former Premier League footballer El Hadji Diouf was arrested and fellow soccer star Anton Ferdinand quizzed by police after a nightclub brawl left a man seriously injured.

Diouf, 31, was held on suspicion of violent disorder while Ferdinand was interviewed under caution following the trouble at Manchester’s exclusive Circle Club in the early hours of yesterday.

The victim, 33, suffered injuries to his head and neck and was found close to the Barton Arcade club in the city.

Star: Diouf has played for Premier League clubs Liverpool and Bolton in his 
career, and is pictured here with a young woman and ex-escort Jenny Thompson, right, who claims she had sex 
with Wayne Rooney

He was taken to hospital where his condition was described as ‘serious but stable’.

The trouble is thought to have spilled
outside of the club and onto nearby Deansgate where blood stains 
remained on the pavement yesterday.

Police are investigating whether a bottle was used.

Five other men were also arrested and expected to be released on bail.

Error: Known for his flash lifestyle, Diouf previously parked his vinyl wrapped Mercedes super car on double yellow lines outside Rio Ferdinand's restaurant in Manchester. He was having a meal with former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye

Attack: Police at the scene gather evidence from the pavement splattered with blood

Shocking: Cleaners use sand to soak up and brooms to scrub the pavement in an attempt to get rid of all the blood

Disturbance: A bloodied footprint and splattered concrete is shown outside the nightclub

Diouf, who lists Bolton Wanderers and Liverpool among his former clubs, was held at the scene.

Ferdinand, 27, who plays for QPR and is the brother of United star Rio, was interviewed by appointment later yesterday.

A witness said that tensions had been 
high between two groups in the nightclub, which was also hosting stars 
of TV show Geordie Shore throughout the evening.

happened on Saturday night

He added: 'It wasn’t very nice.'

The scene remained cordoned off until yesterday afternoon.

A
spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'Six men have been 
arrested and another man is helping police inquiries, which are 
ongoing.'

Incident: El Hadji Diouf, pictured, playing left for Doncaster Rovers, was charged with violent disorder by Greater Manchester Police. Anton Ferdinand, right, was interviewed by officers yesterday

One worker at a nearby shop said: 'It was a mess when I arrived.'

Diouf currently plays for Doncaster 
Rovers, who were relegated from the Championship on Saturday after 
losing 4-3 at home to Portsmouth.

Ferdinand’s QPR went down 1-0 at West Brom in the Premier League.

No-one at the Circle Club wanted to comment about the incident.
