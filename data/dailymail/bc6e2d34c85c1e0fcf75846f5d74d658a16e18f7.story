Taking action: German high jumper Ariane Friedrich posted her stalker's personal details to 'defend herself'

A sleazy Internet stalker who sent explicit photos to a world high jump star got more than he bargained for - when she posted his personal details to her thousands of fans.

German athletics star Ariane Friedrich - who also works as a police officer - named and shamed her online stalker after being emailed photos of a man's genitals.

The 28-year-old star, who will be gunning for high jump gold at the London olympics, posted the man's name, email address and home address on her Facebook page 'as a way of making clear that I am prepared to act'.

Friedrich, a bronze medalist a the 2009 World Athletics Championships, said she posted the man's details to 'defend herself' from the many inappropriate emails she receives.

In her role as a police officer, the German is also thought to be planning to bring charges against the man.

In one post on her official Facebook page, Friedrich, from Frankfurt, told her fans: 'I’ve been offended in the past, sexually harassed and I’ve had a stalker before.

'It’s time to act; it’s time to defend myself. And that’s what I’m doing. No more and no less.'

High profile: Friedrich said her status did not justify her being 'attacked, insulted or sexually harassed'

She defiantly insisted in another post that just because she has a higher profile than others, she does not believe she should be the subject of those who want to 'attack, insult, or sexually harass'.

Friedrich's manager, Günter Eisinger, attempted to play down the incident amid concerns it could affect her preparations for London 2012.

Mr Eisinger told The Local on Saturday: 'The issue has nothing to do with the public.

'We can do without any stress factors.'
