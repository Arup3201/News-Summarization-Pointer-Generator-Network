Plans to end years of dumbing down in schools by replacing GCSEs with rigorous new O-levels rocked the Coalition yesterday.

Nick Clegg erupted with fury and vowed to block Michael Gove’s proposals – revealed exclusively in yesterday’s Daily Mail – to toughen up exams taken at 16, saying they would ‘turn back the clock’ and should not be allowed to ‘cater to the few at the top’.

The Deputy Prime Minister accused the Education Secretary of seeking to send schools back to the 1950s and throw children on ‘the scrap heap’ by proposing a new simple CSE exam for less able pupils alongside the tough new O-levels.

Determined: Education Secretary Michael Gove said he will publish a consultation document in mid-July setting out plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with 'world class exams'

Criticism: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said
the school system 'must be for the many not the few' while Labour 
schools minister Kevin Brennan said Mr Gove's plans would create a 
two-tier system for pupils

Mr Clegg said the reform was ‘not Government policy’, and added: ‘Any exam system, any school system, must be for the many not the few.’

Labour accused Mr Gove of wanting to bring back a ‘two-tier system’, and teaching unions called the plans ‘a hugely backwards step which will harm social mobility’.

David Cameron threw his weight behind the main thrust of the plans, with his aides revealing that the Prime Minister is ‘100 per cent behind Michael’. But the Prime Minister was also incandescent at the way the story was leaked to the Mail before Mr Gove had even discussed it with the Lib Dems.

A source said: ‘Of course David likes this idea. He’s totally behind Michael on these ideas.

'But he’s furious with the way it’s come out because it makes getting the policy through more difficult because it has allowed the Lib Dems to publicly entrench themselves.’

A defiant Mr Gove made it clear that despite Lib Dem objections he will publish a consultation document in mid-July setting out plans to scrap GCSEs and replace them with ‘world class exams’.

It will also outline plans to scrap the National Curriculum and end the requirement that pupils obtain five good GCSEs graded A* to C, which would allow schools to ditch the discredited exams.

British pupils have slipped down international league tables in key subjects over the past decade.

The most authoritative comparison is the Programme for International Student Assessment carried out by the OECD. It is based on tests given to 15-year-olds in up to 65 countries.

When first carried out in 2000, the UK was ranked fourth in science, seventh in literacy and eighth in maths. The science ranking fell to 12th in 2003, 14th in 2006 and 16th in 2009.In literacy the country sank to 11th in 2003, 17th in 2006 and 25th in 2009.

The most dramatic slump is in maths, where the ranking was 18th in 2003, 24th in 2006 and 28th in 2009.

Critics point out that the sample in the survey has grown across the years, from 43 countries in 2000 to 65 in the last study in 2009. But, even when this is taken into account, the UK has still slipped proportionately down the tables.

Under Michael Gove’s plans for a revival, pupils will be able to sit the new O-levels at 16 or 17 and the best pupils will be allowed to bypass the exams and go straight to A-levels.

Schools will be given the freedom to enter pupils for the exams when they are ready, rather than forcing everyone to sit them at 16.

Modular study will be abolished, with emphasis put on in-depth work and end of year exams rather than coursework that can be redone until it passes muster.

Pupils studying English literature will be banned from taking the text of plays into exams and maths pupils will be expected to learn complex subjects such as calculus in order to obtain an A grade.

Mr Gove believes the exams need to be tougher to prepare pupils for A-levels, which are also being made more rigorous.

Meanwhile, businesses will be asked to draw up a new CSE-style qualification for less able pupils – around one quarter of pupils struggle even to get D or E grades at GCSE.

Mr Gove thinks it is pointless to make those children sit the same O-level as those who are preparing to read a rigorous academic subject at Oxford or Cambridge.

Mr Gove can push that change through with a stroke of the pen and without legislation – limiting the Lib Dems’ leverage unless they are prepared to walk out of the Coalition.

The consultation paper will also outline plans to end the scandal of ‘competitive dumbing down’ where exam boards advertise their papers as the easiest to pass. Instead, contracts will be awarded  to just one exam board for each subject.

The reforms would see pupils starting to study for new O-levels in English, maths and science in September 2014, crucially before the next general election.

But Lib Dems made clear that the package of reforms and timetable envisaged by Mr Gove are untenable. Mr Gove may have to settle for including it in the next Tory election manifesto.

A volcanic row erupted when the plans leaked because Mr Gove had not even discussed his ideas with Sarah Teather, the Lib Dem minister in his own department, let alone Mr Clegg.

After a tense transatlantic call with the Deputy Prime Minister – who is in Rio for a climate change summit – Mr Clegg’s aides accused the Education Secretary of trying to ‘bounce’ them into the reforms.

Mr Clegg himself said: ‘This was self-evidently not policy that has either been discussed or agreed within the Coalition government.

‘I’m not in favour of anything that would lead to a two-tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrapheap. What you want is an exam system which is fit for the future, doesn’t turn the clock back to the past and works for the many and not just for the few.’

Lib Dem president Tim Farron called the plans ‘madness’ and said: ‘Let’s kill off immediately any talk of returning to the divisive two-tier system that Mrs Thatcher wisely ended in the late 80s.’

Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘This was not an idea I’d heard about until I saw it on the front page of a newspaper. This might not be an ideal way to form policy.’

But Tories accused Mr Clegg of ‘jumping in’ before he had bothered to examine the details. They pointed out that Mr Gove’s plan would see 75 per cent of pupils taking O-levels.

‘Three quarters is “the many”,’ one source said, referring to Mr Clegg’s ‘many, not the few’ comment. In the Commons, Mr Gove made a robust case for new rigour in secondary education.

He said schools already operate a two-tier system because 42 per cent of pupils currently fail to get the five good GCSEs which employers demand.

He added: ‘Some of our most impressive schools have already left the GCSE behind and opted for the IGCSE or other more rigorous examinations.

'The sad truth is that at least 40 per cent of children have been left behind under the current system. There is no excuse not to act.’

Labour’s schools spokesman Kevin Brennan said: ‘They want to bring back a two-tier exam system designed in the 1950s which will separate children and close off opportunity.’

Dr Mary Bousted, leader of the 
Association of Teachers and Lecturers, described Mr Gove’s plans as 
‘ludicrous’, adding: ‘Where is the evidence that this will be an 
improvement?’

Christine Blower, general secretary 
of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘Michael Gove’s continual 
criticism of GCSEs as a “dumbed down” examination is not only incorrect 
but also very offensive to those pupils and teachers who achieve great 
results every year.

‘Getting
rid of GCSEs and replacing them with the old O-level and CSE 
qualifications could easily lower aspirations and exacerbate 
inequalities in society.’

Chris
Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: ‘There is no evidence 
that the current system is broken, that examinations are getting easier 
or that our qualifications are trailing behind the best in the world. 
Michael Gove’s arrogance is breathtaking.’
