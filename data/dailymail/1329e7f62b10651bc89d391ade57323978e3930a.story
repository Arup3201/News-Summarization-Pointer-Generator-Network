The final straw in John Edwards' doomed marriage with his wife Elizabeth was when he asked to see his love child Quinn, the disgraced politician's mistress has revealed in her tell-all memoir.

Rielle Hunter, who met Edwards in February 2006 and had his daughter two years into their affair, wrote that he promised his wife he would not speak to Hunter again after admitting the child was his.

But in December 2009, more than a year after he finally admitted to being Quinn's father, he told his wife he needed to see the child before she underwent sedation for dental surgery.

Revelations: In her tell-all memoir, John Edwards's mistress Rielle Hunter tells of his love towards his daughter Quinn. The father and daughter are pictured at the beach in North Carolina this weekend

Love child: Edwards denied he was the father of Quinn, pictured left with her mother Hunter, for two years. In her lurid memoir, Hunter reveals her shock at his public denials

'Elizabeth screamed at him, "If you go to be with her at the hospital, we are done!"' Hunter writes in her memoir, What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me.

'He said, "She is my daughter, and I am going",' Hunter added, to which Elizabeth responded: 'I am going to divorce you!'

After 32 years of marriage, the couple signed a separation agreement and Edwards moved out of the home - only to return to following year before Elizabeth lost her battle with cancer.

In the memoir, due out next week and excerpted in People Magazine, Hunter provides an unwavering defense of Edwards and documents his love for Quinn, now four.

The father and daughter were pictured
 together for the first time since 2008 this weekend. Images show 
Edwards at ease with Quinn, as he laughs and plays with her on the beach
 in North Carolina.

'Johnny was so sweet with our daughter,' Hunter writes about the first time he met his daughter.

'She looked right at him with a look of 
love that she still gives him. I have never seen her look at anyone the 
way she looks at her dad.'

The
 love he showed for his daughter came at odds with his public denials of
 his paternity. For two years, he denied the child was his and asked his
 aide, Andrew Young, to pretend to be her father.

When
 the National Enquirer broke the story that Quinn was in fact Edwards' 
daughter, Hunter said she was stunned to hear him continue to deny it.

'Nothing - nothing - prepared me for that,' she writes. 'I watched the man that I loved deny our child. How could he do that?'

Fatherly love: After his acquittal last month, Edwards called his daughter 'precious' - even though he publicly denied she was his for two years

After
 the interview with the National Enquirer, she told him how much his words had hurt her, she wrote.
 He simply responded: 'Sorry, but it didn't mean anything.'

Last month, when Edwards was hauled before a judge on charges that he had used campaign funds to cover up his affair with Hunter, he publicly acknowledge his love for his 'precious' daughter.

After he was acquitted of one count 
of corruption and a mistrial was declared on five other counts, Edwards 
emerged from the court house saying he was grateful to all his children.

He said: 'My precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so grateful for.'

In her memoir, Hunter also gives insight into her pregnancy, which she claims had been unplanned.

'I couldn't imagine I was, given I was 43 and had never been pregnant,' she writes. 'Johnny
 and I never used birth control but I was mindful of my cycle and I was 
certain that I had never been ovulating during any of my visits with 
Johnny.'

Day at the beach: The trio were pictured together at a beach house on Figure Eight Island, North Carolina this weekend, in a sign that Hunter and Edwards are still very much involved

When she told 
Edwards of the pregnancy, he paused and said kindly: 'I want to be clear
 that whatever you decide, this is your decision, and I support you.'

The excerpts, published in People Magazine, provide the latest revelations from the book, which is due out on June 26.

She claims she wrote the juicy book for 
Quinn and is part of her 'duty' Edwards' three other children, Cate, 
Emma Claire and Jack, that he had with Elizabeth.

It offers lurid details about the
 couple's sex life, especially the 'extraordinary' sleepless night she 
'surrendered' to Edwards just hours after meeting him at a reception in a
 New York City hotel.

The 
memoir also provides a scathing attack on Edwards's wife, who lost her 
battle with cancer in December 2010. She was battling the disease when 
her husband's affair became public.

Despite
 these horrific circumstances, Hunter shows only scorn for Elizabeth. 
She says she was controlling and abusive toward her husband, which drove
 him into the arms of other women.

Hunter calls her lover's late wife 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels'.

'Many people invested their hearts, their time and their energy into the image of John and Elizabeth Edwards,' she writes.

'While this image wasn't exactly true, I did play a role in destroying this myth, and many supporters ended up feeling hurt, betrayed, and disillusioned.'

The excerpts also describe Elizabeth's tortured reaction to learning that her husband was having an affair with Hunter, his campaign videographer.

'Elizabeth requested all the tapes (Iâ€™d made of the campaign). She locked herself in a room to watch,' Hunter writes.

Loved up: The couple appeared at ease on the beach break, which came after Edwards' corruption trial

'On one tape she saw Johnny walking 
into a room and his reaction to seeing me. She apparently told him that 
he never once looked at her the way he looked at me. So she took that 
bit and put it on her computer as a screen saver in order to watch it 
over and over again.'

Hunter added she is still in love 
with Edwards and that they're still together as a couple, even though he
 lives 140 miles away and sometimes only visits once every two weeks.

The mistress likened their 
relationship to that of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn - the A-list 
Hollywood couple who have been together for nearly 30 years but never 
married.

She added: 'Marriage? I have no idea. I'm not a big fan of the institution, but never say never.'
