You may think you can outsmart the road authorities, but soon it won’t just be their speed cameras keeping an eye on your driving.

General Motors is set to become the first car manufacturer to install eye-tracking technology in its vehicles, according to a recent report.

The feature will allow cars to track drivers’ eye movements to ensure they keep their attention on the road.

GM will install around half a million cars with eye-tracking devices over the next three to five years, according to unnamed sources speaking to the Financial Times.

The Detroit car manufacturer is using technology made by Seeing Machines, a Canberra-based company who specialises in driver fatigue technology.

Cameras fitted in the cars will be backed by algorithms that can identify features of drivers' faces.

The technology will then impose this information on a three-dimensional map of the interior of the car to determine what the driver is looking at.

It will also be able to measure the rotation of the head so they can alert drivers if they are not spending enough time looking in areas such as the rear-view mirror.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one of every ten fatal crashes in the US involves distraction.

Meanwhile, statistics provided by the RAC reveal that 20 per cent of Australian drivers involved in crashes admit they were staring at the object they ended up hitting, because they were distracted.

As well as safety, the technology could allow drivers to communicate with their cars, without having to press a button or turn the wheel.

However, it could raise privacy issues over how manufacturers and insurers deal with the data.

Seeing Machines' devices said, initially, it will not keep the information it records. 

GM has been contacted for comment by MailOnline, but has yet to respond.

While GM may be monitoring eye movements, a new car hopes to solve the problem of driver distraction by using a brain waves to start the engine and keep it going.

The concept, developed by the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia and Emotiv, is currently being tested in a Honda i40.

The Attention Powered Car features a neuro headset that connects brain activity to the car’s engine through customised software.

The headset has 14 sensors detecting electrical activity from the frontal, temple, parietal and perceptual areas of the brain.

The amount of activity in these areas registers what the driver is processing, or if they are zoning out. When the driver is distracted, the software sends a cut-off signal to the car and the accelerator switches to idle safely slowing the car down.
