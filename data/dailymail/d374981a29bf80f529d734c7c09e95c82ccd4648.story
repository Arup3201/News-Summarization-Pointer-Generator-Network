The eldest siblings in a large family face the best chance of scoring something serious when it comes to online dating.

Their confidence, leadership skills and high achievements set them up for great chances of relationship success, compared to middle children who face the worst prospects, say researchers.

Only children fall somewhere in the middle, with just less than half walking away from online dating with a partner, according to a new study.

Sociologists have debated for decades the impact birth order has on lifestyle, relationships and leadership.Â 

And now a comprehensive study of online dating singles brings perspective on how it impacts our ability to find love.

Data involving 7.6 million PlentyOfFish users was compiled and analysed
 by a team of PhD researchers who looked for trends.

They discovered middle children are the least likely to find a relationship, in comparison to their eldest and youngest siblings.

Eldest children are increasingly more likely to find love online the bigger the family, reaching 10 per cent more likely if there's four siblings.

Meanwhile younger children in a family are consistently less likely to end up in a real relationship than older ones.

However, these figures switch slightly when the family expands to five siblings on more.

The
 eldest in the situation is 4.4 times more likely to find love online, 
but the youngest beats them with a 5.5 per cent chance.

While eldest kids are more likely to 'looking for someone to marry' on the website, youngest children were found to be most likely to be 'looking for a relationship'.

Sex and relationship expert Tracey Cox says: 'Birth order personality theories are either in or out of favour in psychology, depending on the latest research.

'You're
 not fated to live out your life dominated by the random timing of your 
birth. The stereotypes are more based on our role in the family which is
 something we are free to change.

'The first result - that younger siblings find it harder to find love online - is surprising and goes against the evidence we have about birth order. The youngest usually has great social skills and is popular, which would make it easier for them to flirt and find love online.

'It's not surprising the firstborn (oldest) is successful since they're the most likely to assume a leadership position and be high achievers.

'This usually makes them good communicators - a big plus when you're connecting to people through a written profile.

'Only children falling bang in the middle also didn't surprise me. Only children often feel like they're living their lives in a goldfish bowl because they tend to be the focus of their parents lives.

'Some people enjoy the attention, so would embrace the let's show off factor which can make you successful at online dating. Others hate it, so would either avoid going online or do it reluctantly because of the public attention factor.'

Researchers highlight that just because middle children don't leave the site in a relationship doesn't mean they haven't found what they're looking for.

A spokesperson for PlentyOfFish said: 'Our
 best educated guess based on the results of the study, is that middle 
children have an increased sense of independence and desire to break 
from conformity.

'This may lead them to feel less inclination to be in a relationship and follow a traditional life path.'

Adding to their unconventional reputation, middle children were found to be 20 per cent more likely to own a bird as a pet.
