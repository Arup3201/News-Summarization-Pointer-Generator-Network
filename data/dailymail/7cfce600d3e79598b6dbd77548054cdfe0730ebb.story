Tiny and vulnerable, these puppies would melt even the hardest of hearts.

But just hours after they were born, the pups were cruelly abandoned in a gas station bin with their umbilical cords still attached.

The litter of ten were discovered when someone went to throw something away in the Lake Tahoe dumpster - and were taken to a rescue centre.

Sadly, four of them died after their harsh start to life, leaving their six siblings to battle on.

Now, two weeks after they were found, the adorable youngsters have made a swift recovery after volunteers from Pet Network Humane Society in Incline Village, Nevada, worked around the clock to feed and care for them.

The centre's executive director Becky Goodman said her group of volunteers were 'traumatized' when they discovered that the newborn dogs had been taken from their mother and dumped in the bin, TribTown.com reported

'All of us are having a very hard time wrapping our minds around that someone was willing to do that,' she said.  

The animals will be put up for adoption in about two months, said Becky Goodman, executive director of the Pet Network Humane Society

'That's someone who didn't care to give them a chance. In that respect, based on the helplessness of the animals involved, it's one of the worst cases we've dealt with.'

The director said that the remaining pups 'are doing very, very well,' the Reno Gazette reported.

'It's blind luck that someone went to the dumpster to toss something away and found those puppies,' she said.

The puppies spend days at the shelter and nights with several foster parents, who feed them every two hours, KOLO TV reported.

The shelter has informed the police and animal control but believe it's unlikely they will find out who dumped the young dogs

The organization is accepting donations for care of the puppies and applications to adopt them

Pet Network Humane Society have been keeping its followers up to date eon Facebook with the puppies' progress

Foster parent Diane Finegan said. 'They are so sweet and they deserve a chance in life and we're hoping they get good homes.'

The shelter has informed the police and animal control but believe it's unlikely they'll find out who dumped the dogs.

The litter will soon be ready for adoption and a loving home, and the organization is accepting donations for care of the puppies and applications to adopt them.
