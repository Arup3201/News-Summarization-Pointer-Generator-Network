Chelsea do consider their sponsorship interests when the club buys a new player but the Blues would never sign someone who isn't good enough, insists manager Jose Mourinho.

The west London club, who agreed a £200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturers Yokohama Rubber in February, are believed to have made an offer for FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto.

The 22-year-old international would be the first Japanese player to sign for Chelsea if he completes a move to Stamford Bridge this summer, although Mourinho is adamant that commercial deals would never fully dictate his transfer policy.

Asked about Muto in his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's game against QPR, Mourinho said: 'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo.

'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 

'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play.

'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.'

FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane claims that Chelsea have made a bid - understood to be around £4m - for Muto, who has 11 caps and one goal for his country.

Speaking to Sports Nippon, Ogane said: 'It is true that Chelsea sent us an offer for Muto.

Muto admits it is an 'honour' to receive an offer from Chelsea although he has not yet decided to join the club

'It is a formal offer with conditions. They want to acquire him in the summer.'

Muto, who only graduated from Keio University a fortnight ago after completing an economics degree, admits that he isn't sure if he will join the Premier League title chasers despite being pleased with their bid.

He said: 'I have not decided yet at all. It is an honour for me to receive this offer from a great club.'

Asked about the influence of the Yokohama Rubber deal on his moves in the transfer market, Mourinho said: 'That's modern football. That's modern management. You cannot close the door completely to commercial interests. 

'A football club is always a football club. We would never bring a player if the player has no capacity to be in a Chelsea football club squad.'
