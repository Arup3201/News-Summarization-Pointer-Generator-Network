An Australian mother has been left struggling to make ends meet and she claims it is because her partner left her for another man, took her possessions and left her with nothing but bills.

Leeann Maker says that after ten years and one child together, she is 'living in misery' after her de facto husband Dan Raja walked out on their family, allegedly for a man.

Around 12 months ago, Mr Raja reportedly left began a romantic relationship with Lorenzo Kirisome, a man who refers to himself as a ‘gay man of God’, according to A Current Affair. 

'This is every woman’s worst nightmare. He’s left me for a man. I gave him ten years of my life,' Ms Maker said in an interview with A Current Affair.

‘They are constantly financially crippling me.

‘I’m not sure how I keep on going, I just know I have to, so I do.’

Ms Maker says she has been left with nothing but bills and her entire lifestyle has changed. Before the break-up, 'if I wanted to see my botox lady, I could just go and see her'

To add to her heartbreak, she claims Mr Kirisome is now using her iPhone and driving her Mercedes after her husband took them from her during their break up.

 Meanwhile, she is left struggling to pay for basic necessities.

'(Before the break up) if I wanted to see my botox lady, then I could just see her,' Ms Maker told A Current Affair.

'I can't take the kids to theme parks during the holidays like I used to. 

I can't take them out for take away.'

She laments the impact it is having on her and her children's happiness. 

'We used to go to a restaurant or get take away two, three nights a week every week,' she said.

'Now I can't do that.' 

She cannot believe the cheek of the pair, fuming because she is being sent toll fines that are in her name, but a result of Mr Kirisome's antics in her car.

Mr Raja and Mr Kirisome deny being in a relationship. Although Mr Kirisome is an openly gay man, they both deny that Mr Raja is involved with men

Mr Kirisome defends his behaviour by explaining that 'the vehicle is in Dan's name. It was paid for by him a couple of days ago.' 

Ms Maker, who was a stay-at-home mother, has suddenly found herself unable to make ends meet.  

She has been left without any source of income, explaining: 'I was the home-maker, the child raiser. I would do the cooking and all the errands. I was basically his personal assistant.'

'(Dan) stopped paying everything, I've been left with electricity and gas bills,' Ms Maker claims. 

Asked if she had any inkling that her husband was interested in men, the mother admits that there were a signs in recent years that had started to concern her.

'There was a certain way he would dance, the way he would speak sometimes, the way he would hold himself,' she explained.

Mr Raja and Mr Kirisome both deny allegations that they are in a romantic relationship.

Ms Maker's ex-partner is also adamant that he is not involved with men. 

Mr Kirisome rang Mr Raja during an interview in a carpark with A Current Affair. While on loud speaker, Mr Raja insisted 'you obviously don't know the full story'

Mr Kirisome denied all allegations and argued that the belongings were in Mr Raja's name, so it was his right to remove them from Ms Maker and give them to Mr Kirisome

When asked 'if Mr Raja is gay' by an A Current Affair reporter, Mr Kirisome responded explosively, using many expletives during their conversation.

'Oh yeah (Dan's) very, very happy. He's f***ing gay as can be. He's happy,' said Mr Kirisome sarcastically in response.

He then became serious, clarifying, 'He's not gay at all, no he's not.'

'We have absolutely nothing to hide. We're not in a romantic relationship.' 

However, despite Mr Kirisome and Mr Raja's argument that the items are in Mr Raja's name, Family Law in Australia states that Mr Raja's ex-partner has legal entitlements. 

Mr Kirisome was angry and defensive when confronted by reporters, who asked him why he is now using Ms Maker's iPhone and driving her Mercedes

'When you're in a relationship or in a marriage, the property is owned by each of you, irrespective of whose name it's registered in,' family lawyer Deborah Avizzio told A Current Affair. 

'That’s the benefit of the family law in Australia.

'For people who don’t make a financial contribution, like a typical home maker type role, their contributions are still recognised as a home-maker or a parent.’ 

Ms Maker is determined to make sure that she and her family are given the money and respect she feels they deserve.

'My children and I don't deserve this.'
