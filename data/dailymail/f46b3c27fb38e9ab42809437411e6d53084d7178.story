A mother-of-three has completely shunned modern life in favour of 1940s glamour, ensuring her clothes, house, car, food, and even her friends match the style of the era.

Forensic psychiatric nurse Christine Edun, 55, who lives in Formby, Merseyside, has dedicated her whole life to emulating the style of the decade since she was a teenager, when she began spending hours scouring vintage markets looking for authentic pieces of clothing from the decade.

Christine loved the style of the fashion, the music and the films, and though her childhood obsession started with dresses and handbags, 
when she moved into her own home Christine started looking for 1940s style furniture,
and now says her house is like a treasure trove for vintage goods.

Christine Edun from Formby, Merseyside is a 55-year-old psychiatric nurse who loves the 1940s so much that she only ever wears vintage clothes

Christine has spent her entire life scouring vintage markets and antique shops in order to dress and live in a way that harks back to the 1940s

She and her supportive husband Ray have even spent thousands restoring an original 1946 Rolls Royce. And she has now launched a business selling Forties underwear.

Her family, including husband Ray, 58, 
and grown up children Jay, 28, and twins Yvette and Gemma, 25, support 
her lifestyle but it is just Christine who shuns the 21st Century.

She even wears 1940s period clothing at work. And when she comes home she walks 
into her 1940s home, slips into her vintage underwear and 1940s clothing, 
and is suddenly transported back to the decade she adores.

She says she feels as though she is 
living in a time warp and her home, in Formby, Merseyside, is a safe 
haven away from the complications of modern life. She doesn't even mind that she sometimes gets 'funny looks in the pub'.

When she comes home she walks into her 1940s home, slips into her vintage underwear and 1940s clothing, and is suddenly transported back to the decade she adores

'When I left school and started earning money, I started going around vintage markets and looking for one-off pieces. I wanted to look different to the rest of my friends and I started collecting really special pieces'

Every morning Christine sits at her Edwardian dressing table and fixes her hair in classic 1940s Victory rolls and keeps her make up looking retro with foundation, powder and red lipstick.

And the obsession doesn't end at clothes and home furnishings.

Christine and her husband Ray a mechanical marine engineer, have started attending vintage inspired events, such as lindy-hop tea dances, where they have met couples just like themselves who turned up dressed head-to-toe in vintage finery.

Christine said: 'I was born in 1958 in London. My dad was bombed out of his home in West Ham during the war so the realities of the decade were very real to my family.

'It was a time when people worked together to get through the depression. People worked together to get up on their feet after the war. It showed what the British were made of.

'I love the gentility of the period. Men would hold doors open for women, and the clothes women wore were so feminine and pretty.

'I'd always admired the traditional dresses with nipped in waists and delicate stockings. The clothes were just so smart and stylish.'

Christine loves the fine underwear of the Forties that she has launched her own business selling beautiful pieces online, Femme Fatale

But it was only when Christine began earning her own money that her obsession could really take off.

'When I left school and started earning money, I started going around vintage markets and looking for one-off pieces,' she said. 'I wanted to look different to the rest of my friends and I started collecting really special pieces.

'I wear my hair in Victory Rolls and stick to foundation, powder and red lipstick.

'One of my favourite parts of dressing the way I do is the lingerie and nightwear, and I have even launched my own business selling beautiful underwear online called Femme Fatale.

'The vintage knickers, camis, corsets, stockings and suspenders are so feminine and they feel so beautiful under your clothes.

'The nightwear is also so beautiful. I have gorgeous silk dressing gowns that make me feel like an on-screen goddess!'

'A lot of our friends we meet up with at weekends also dress in 1940s clothes. Sometimes we get some funny looks in the pub, but we just love to embrace the bygone era'

And as for her best vintage buy?

'My favourite ever vintage buy is a 1940s suit. I bought it from a dealer about 2 years ago.

'We even go to 1940s style events such as fairs and dances. We do the jive, the lindy-hop and have met similar couples to ourselves in doing so.
