In the last Prime Minister’s Questions before the Scottish referendum, David Cameron was given a stark warning.

Tory grandee Sir Edward Leigh told the PM he had been 'complacent' about the risk of Scotland leaving the UK which would trigger a 'national humiliation of catastrophic proportions'.

Four days later, the Westminster party leaders – and much of the London-based media – were jolted out of the assumption that the Union was safe, when a YouGov poll put the Yes campaign ahead.

It triggered extraordinary panic, saw Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg rush north to campaign, and led to the offer of increased tax and spending powers to Scotland which will reshape the whole of the UK.

For months the No campaign had been ahead in the polls. In the year to August, Better Together had enjoyed a lead on average of 22 points.

But as referendum day approached, and Alex Salmond triumphed in the second live TV debate with Alistair Darling, the polls narrowed dramatically.

Late on Saturday September 6, details of a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times emerged, putting Yes on 51 per cent and No on 49 per cent.

It was a huge boost for Mr Salmond, and a wake-up call for complacent politicians in Westminster.

While there had been a trend of the polls narrowing, as more and more ‘undecided’ voters fell to one side or the other, it came as a huge shock.

Mr Cameron cancelled Prime Minister’s Questions to fly to Scotland, where he urged voters not to use the referendum to give ‘the effing Tories a kicking’.

Labour’s Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg also took to the campaign trail.

But it was the dramatic revival of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown which proved to be the most significant consequence of the YouGov survey.

Building up a head of steam during a series of public meetings and rallies, Mr Brown appeared to bounce the Westminster parties into a new timetable for increased powers for devolution.

He announced his cross-party package of measures giving Scotland greater control over spending, welfare and taxation could be in place by the end of next month and in operation by the end of January.

Now there are growing doubts about whether the package was necessary, and offered in a rush to reverse one opinion poll.

Eminent elections expert Professor Michael Thrasher said: 'I doubt the Yes campaign were ever ahead.'

And Andrew Hawkins, from polling firm ComRes, said: 'The move to afford Scotland greater powers looks like a knee-jerk reaction - opening a Pandora's box in Westminster that creates problems for both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband in the run-up to the General Election.'

An overnight survey carried out by Lord Ashcroft reveals more details about how Scots actually voted.

The poll of 2,000 people shows that the No campaign won among men (by a six-point margin) as well as women (by twelve points).

It contradicts earlier surveys suggesting men were split 50:50, with women overwhelmingly against independence.

Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of those aged 65 or over voted No, while 51 per cent of 16-24-year-olds back Yes, along with 59 per cent of 25-34-year-olds.

Lord Ashcroft said: ‘As the recent tightening in the polls suggested, those who made up their minds late in the campaign were more likely to choose independence.

Alex Salmond claimed the Scottish people were moving in their droves to the 'Yes' campaign and confidently predicted that they would back independence but only his party's supporters backed separation

The under 55s in Scotland backed independence but were out-voted by the older generation of Scots

Alex Salmond's campaign against the Union dramatically increased support for independence - but was not quite enough

‘Two thirds of those who decided in the last few days voted Yes; No voters were much more likely than Yes supporters to say they decided more than a year ago or always knew how they would vote.’

Mr Brown’s offer of more powers to Scotland now risks overhauling th whole of the UK.

In a statement in Downing Street this morning, Mr Cameron said he would use the opportunity to pursue ‘English votes for English matters’.

Mr Brown said new powers could be voted on in the Commons by March next year.

Alex Salmond said Scotland expected the new deal to be agreed by this date.

However, Conservative and Labour MPs are at odds over how the new settlement will work, throwing the future of Scottish devolution into doubt.

Mr Cameron said it was 'crucial' to give England the same powers over tax, spending and welfare as Scotland.

He pledged to make this happen at the same time as devolving powers to Scotland, following his last minute pledge for further devolution during the referendum campaign.

Mr Cameron said: 'The people of Scotland have spoken. It is a clear result. They have kept our country of four nations together. Like millions of other people, I am delighted.'

He said it was now time for the United Kingdom 'to come together and to move forward'.
