Edward Snowden has denied stealing co-workers' passwords to illegally access the National Security Agency's database and leak its secrets to the world.

The 30-year-old refuted the claim during an online  Q&A session yesterday, adding that while returning to the US would be the 'best resolution' for everyone, doing so is impossible because he has 'no chance' of a fair trial.

The whistleblower is currently living under temporary asylum in Russia after revealing U.S. government secrets on surveillance programs and other activities last year.

No fair: The 30-year-old refuted the claim during a Q&A session on the 'Free Snowden' website yesterday, adding that while returning to the US would be the 'best resolution' for everyone, doing so is impossible because he has 'no chance' of a fair trial

'I'm not a spy': Snowden in October 11, 2013 during a WikiLeaks press conference. He has denied stealing co-workers' passwords to illegally access the National Security Agency's database and leak its secrets to the world

A Reuters 
report in November that quoted unnamed sources as saying Snowden used login 
credentials and passwords provided unwittingly by colleagues at a spy 
base in Hawaii to access some of the classified material he leaked to 
the media.

But Snowden branded that report 'simply wrong,' adding, 'I never stole any passwords, nor did I trick an army of co-workers.'

And yesterday he claimed the nearly 100-year-old Espionage Act, under which he is charged, 'forbids a public interest defense.'

'This is especially frustrating, because it means there’s no chance to have a fair trial, and no way I can come home and make my case to a jury,' he said.

'Returning to the US, I think, is the 
best resolution for the government, the public, and myself, but it's 
unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower 
protection laws, which, through a failure in law, did not cover national
 security contractors like myself,' he told the 'Free Snowden' website.

Earlier, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that if Snowden wanted to return to the U.S. and enter a guilty plea, the Justice Department would 'engage with his lawyers.'

'Of course if Mr. Snowden’s lawyers informed us their client was prepared to take accountability by pleading guilty to the charges filed against him, we would engage with his lawyers on that, as we would with any other defendant,' a Department of Justice spokesperson echoed later.

Snowden has denied the accusations of the House Intelligence Committee that he worked with the Russian security services to leak documents about U.S national security

It comes after Snowden denied 
accusations that he worked in cahoots with the Russian government to 
leak secrets, calling the theories 'absurd'.

Before
 that, the House Intelligence Committee chair, Rep. Mike Rogers, who is 
in charge of an ongoing investigations into Snowden's relationship with 
Russia, said: 'I believe there's a reason he 
ended up in their hands, the "loving arms" of an FSB (Russian security) 
agent in Moscow. I don't think that's a coincidence.'

In response to the allegations, Snowden 
said: 'I clearly and unambiguously acted alone, with no assistance from 
anyone, much less a government.

'It won't stick, because it's clearly 
false, and the American people are smarter than politicians think they 
are. This Russian spy push is absurd.'

In addition, a top member of the the House's Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Rachel McCaul, said: 'I personally believe that he was cultivated by a foreign power to do what he did.

US President Barack Obama speaks about the National Security Agency (NSA) and intelligence agencies surveillance techniques in the US, reacting to leaks by former N.S.A contractor Edward Snowden

In the speech Obama said more could be done to protect the civil liberties of his citizens, and also pledged to end spying on friendly heads of state

'I can't give a definitive statement 
on that, but I've been given all the evidence I know Mike Rogers has 
access to. I don't think he was working alone.'

Speaking in an interview with the New Yorker,
 Snowden pointed to the forty days he spent trapped in Sheremetyevo 
Airport in Moscow after he fled the U.S., as evidence that he had worked
 alone.

He said: 'Spies get treated better than that.'

This
 is not the first allegation against Snowden claiming he is a spy. Last 
July he was accused of working for the Chinese, and has come out against
 the media for reporting the allegations both last year, and today.

He
 said: 'If I were a Chinese spy, why wouldn't I have flown directly to 
Beijing? I could be living in a palace petting a Phoenix by now. The 
media has a major role to play in American society, and they're really 
abdicating their responsibility to hold power to account.'

In danger: Snowden took refuge in Moscow to evade treason charges after disclosing U.S. state secrets on NSA intelligence gathering, and now fears for his life and wants to increase security

The allegations have come only days after President Barack Obama spoke last Friday about the trimming the power of U.S. intelligence services, reacting to the leaks by Snowden.

Speaking at the U.S. Department of Justice on January 17, he called for new privacy safeguards and said he had stopped the NSA spy taps on friendly world leaders.

The president said he would be ending the NSA's hoarding of telephone "metadata", informaion that shows the detail and destination of calls, but not their content, agreeing with critics who said that the program could open the door to more intrusion. 

However, Obama has decided that he 
will allow bulk phone data sweeps of the citizens living in the U.S. to 
continue as an anti-terror tool.

He said: 'I believe we need a new approach. I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists, and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk meta-data.

Since Obama's long awaited speech, Snowden has had fears for his life according to his Russian lawyer.

Explicit threats to kill him were made anonymously by Pentagon and National Security Agency officials, alleged Anatoly Kucherena.

In an interview with Russian news channel Vesti, he said: 'There are real threats to his life out there that actually do exist.

‘These statements call for physical retribution against Edward Snowden.’
