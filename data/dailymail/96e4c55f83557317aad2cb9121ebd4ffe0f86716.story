In Steven Gerrard’s dreams, Wednesday night ends with him celebrating like it is 2009. Liverpool blow Real Madrid away, their stuttering season catches fire and more memories are created to last a lifetime.

His nightmares, however, involve an embarrassment, of Liverpool finding themselves on the receiving end of a scoreline similar to the 4-0 drubbing they administered to Real, when these teams last collided five years ago.

The first scenario, he believes, is possible, particularly if Brendan Rodgers’ side are swept along on a wave of emotion. If Liverpool use the energy that a highly-charged Anfield crowd will give them, Gerrard hopes they can swarm all over Los Blancos.

Steven Gerrard has told his Liverpool team-mates not to shy away against Real Madrid on Wednesday night

Cristiano Ronaldo and his Real Madrid team-mates braved stormy conditions during a training session at Anfield on Tuesday evening.

The Portugal international was well prepared for the adverse weather and wore a snood on his head as cover for the duration of the session.

But the second picture, Gerrard recognises, is also possible, especially if one member of Liverpool’s starting line-up approaches this contest with the mindset that they can coast through 90 minutes, not pushing themselves to the limit.

For Liverpool to defy the odds, no passengers are permitted. ‘That applies to me personally as well,’ Gerrard said.

‘Everyone who is picked to play — from the 11 in the starting line-up to the subs on the bench — everyone has to be on their game. We are playing against the best side in Europe and if we have two or three passengers, we get beat convincingly.

‘It can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly away from home on the counter-attack. We need to be right on it. But when big questions get asked of this team — especially last year when big hitters came to town — we raised our game.

‘The fans raised their game, we raised ours and put in some really good performances. I think a (big) performance is due now. QPR wasn’t good enough, everyone knows that, but everyone will respect that when Real Madrid come into town it’s a different game to get up for.

‘Every player in the dressing room realises we can’t have any passengers or we will get beat convincingly. I can understand that (many people are predicting a Madrid win). Most places they go, with the current players and the form they are in, they are expected to win most games they play.

‘I understand those opinions but shocks are there, upsets happen. Yes, we understand we are the underdogs but with the atmosphere we have here and the players raising their game for a night like this, I think it is possible to cause an upset.’

Given the way Liverpool played at Loftus Road on Sunday, many would find it difficult to see why the captain has such optimism. Liverpool’s play has been scruffy and inconsistent this season and logic dictates that it should be no different, especially against a side of Madrid’s undoubted class.

But this, remember, is Anfield on a European night. This is the stadium where logic is often defied on such occasions, when the improbable has been made possible. Gerrard has been a key protagonist in the drama since the turn of this century, not least on March 10, 2009.

‘Looking back at the game, the reason we came out on top was because we were aggressive with and without the ball,’ said Gerrard, who scored two of Liverpool’s four goals.

‘We pressed from the front and had a world-class talent in (Fernando) Torres and we forced them into mistakes. I can’t give away tactics but with due respect to the team in 2009 individually Real Madrid have improved so we have huge respect for their current team.

‘We need to enjoy the game but you only enjoy games like this when you play as a team. We’re looking to shock a few people.’

There were times during a five-year absence from the Champions League when Gerrard admitted to being consumed with envy towards those who had taken Liverpool’s place and it is why he makes a point of re-emphasising this is not simply an occasion to enjoy.

‘I think all the hard work Brendan has done and the lads have done (means) we deserve nights like these,’ said Gerrard, for whom this will be a 127th European appearance.

‘I just hope no-one from the outside thinks we are just going into these games to enjoy ourselves. I hope nobody thinks we are settling for being in the Champions League.

‘Madrid are top opposition and probably the best side in Europe but we want to give a good account of ourselves. This is a great opportunity for us to put in a really strong performance.’

It is time, then, for Liverpool to prove that the spellbinding play of last season was not a flash in the pan. 

They might be comparative novices in this competition but, as 34-year-old Gerrard points out, that will count for nothing when the whistle blows.

Gerrard and manager Brendan Rodgers spoke to the press ahead of Liverpool's clash with Real Madrid

Arsenal's new striker Danny Welbeck sent Steven Gerrard a message on Instagram ahead of Real Madrid's visit, writing: 'Good luck for tomorrow!' 

‘I don’t think any of us expect a year’s leeway,’ said Gerrard. ‘In the time I’ve been here I have never experienced supporters saying “oh it is just nice to be in Champions League; it doesn’t matter how you do, you will get judged next year”.

‘We will get judged against the best side in Europe. The message to the players is simple: we need a performance.

‘I am pretty confident that we can surprise a few people but that is how I am. I go into games with optimism, rather than fearing individuals and the opposition.’

His team-mates must follow suit if Gerrard’s dream is to come true.
