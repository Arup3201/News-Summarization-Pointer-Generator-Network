Sydney may boast acclaimed restaurants like Tetsuya’s and Sokyo, but there’s one Japanese dining experience the city has been sorely lacking-until now.

For two nights in February, the sensory-overloading Robot Restaurant is appearing in Australia as a popup experience. Leading travel brand Contiki is organising the surreal dinner-and-show in a bid to bring a unique taste of Japan down under.

The event, titled Robots Unrivalled, will be a theatrical barrage of neon-lights, fembots and cabaret performances that transports diners into a mind-boggling robotic future.

The sci-fi eatery has amassed a cult following in Japan for its out-of-this-world appeal, and with good cause; where else can you enjoy a meal watching bikini-clad women dance with robot pandas?

Maybe you’d prefer the transformer-esque robots going toe to toe in a boxing? Or android dinosaurs dancing to techno amid a bombardment of lasers?

In another segment, girls dressed as rave bunnies play along to the frantic music in a synchronised drum line. To help immerse diners in the experience, LED bikini-clad waitresses will be serving cocktails to your tables.

There truly is something for everyone, though a word of warning: epileptics should probably not be touching the event with a ten-foot pole.

The official website for the Sydney event has the following description: 'Expect amazing dance routines set to thumping J-Pop beats, more fluorescent lights and lasers than should ever be allowed in one place and of course… HUGE FREAKING ROBOTS doing battle in an attempt to destroy mankind once and for all!'

It’s being hosted by popular travel brand Contiki in conjunction with their 13 day Japan Unrivalled trip, a bid to bring a unique taste of Japan down under.

The Robot Restaurant was launched in 2012 in Shinjuku’s Kabukicho area, a prominent red-light district. With reports it cost some $10 million to construct, nearly every surface of the club is decorated in lights, mirrors, or flat panel monitors.

It has since earned a reputation with locals and tourists alike as being an otherworldly experience. While it is deemed a restaurant, the food reportedly takes a backseat to the performance, with diners being served a simple bento box akin to what is found in Japanese convenience stores.

It's unclear what food will be served at the Sydney event, but some reports have claimed there will be 'authentic Japanese street food'.

With a barrage of laser lights and reflective surfaces, epileptics should probably not be touching the event with a ten-foot pole.
