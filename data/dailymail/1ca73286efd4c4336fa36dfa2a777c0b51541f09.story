‘I wanted to let her know how much I missed her," Lafferty told People Magazine, ‘No daughter should ever have to do that on her wedding day.’Planning for the wedding was one of the last things the two women did before the horrific December 2012 shooting that claimed Hochsprung’s life, along with dozens of others. The heroic principle saved the lives of countless children and teachers by confronting gunman Adam Lanza while the public address system broadcasted the sounds to the whole school, alerting them to the danger, according to media reports.

Planning for my wedding was actually one of the last things my mom and I did together before she was killed,’ Lafferty told the magazine.Lafferty and longtime boyfriend Christopher Smegielski were married at her Hochsprung’s upstate New York lake house in the Adirondacks, according to the magazine.As a tribute to her mother, Lafferty wore custom sneakers as part of her bridal ensemble.
