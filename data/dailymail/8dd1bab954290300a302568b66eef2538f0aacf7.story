Hundreds of Hammers turned out to meet new Hammers signings Mauro Zarate, Diego Poyet and Cheikhou Kouyate ahead of their Upton Park debuts against Sampdoria on Saturday.

The trio were at the club's Romford store to sign autographs, chat with fans and pose for photographs as they took time out to meet fans before Saturday's Marathonbet Cup match.

Argentine striker Zarate also gave fans a first glimpse of the Hammers' new third kit, which will go on sale to at 9am on Saturday from club stores and their official website.

Midfielder Kouyate was taken aback by the numbers present at the signing session, and the Senegal international was thrilled to meet the supporters.

He said: 'It was great to see the fans on Thursday. It was a natural environment and it's nice to see them enjoying themselves.

'We enjoy it too because it allows us to create a relationship and a link with them, which is very important. It was a lot of fun.

'Before I came to the club Mo Diame told me that I would really enjoy it here and that the crowd is fantastic.

'I'm looking forward to getting started playing for West Ham.'
