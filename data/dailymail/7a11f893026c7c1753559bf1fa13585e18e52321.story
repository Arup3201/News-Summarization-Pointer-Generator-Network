A homeowner has become the first person  to win a payout from Npower for harassment and breach of contract after being mis-sold a tariff by a doorstep salesman.

David Osborn, 59, won his four-year legal  battle against the energy giant after the cheap rate he signed up to failed to materialise.

The 59-year-old was instead put on a tariff that would potentially cost an extra £2,000 over the two-and-a-half year contract.

When he refused to pay the difference, Npower began chasing him for payment, hiring ten debt collection agencies to pursue him.

Mr Osborn took his case to the small claims court, which awarded him £1,000 compensation for breach of contract and harassment.

Yesterday, the safety and environmental consultant said that the company’s tactics had been ‘truly frightening’.

‘We were threatened that people may come to our house with a magistrate’s warrant and forcibly enter our home to disconnect our gas and electricity,’ he said. ‘This was a truly frightening prospect.

My wife and children were scared to open the front door in case bailiffs came bursting in. We were so concerned we were going to be left in the dark without power or heating.’

Mr Osborn originally signed up to a price plan named Price Fix 2011 when a doorstep salesman called at his house in Longwell Green, Bristol, in 2008. Under the terms of the deal, he would pay just 7.5p per kilowatt of electricity and 2p per kilowatt of gas until 2011.

Strong-willed David triumphed over npower in a landmark legal wrangle, after a four-year battle over a door-to-door sales contract

Father-of-two David said: 'I don’t 
normally give doorstep salesmen the time of day but I was very 
dissatisfied with my supplier as they always seemed to be holding 
several hundred pounds of my money in credit.

'I told him that I would take the npower package provided I could pay my bills by online banking, rather than direct debit.

'He agreed, we shook hands and I signed up.'

However, he was later told this tariff had been withdrawn and that he had been placed on the standard rate, which was twice as expensive.

David refused to pay the extra and instead only paid what he should have been under the terms of the Price Fix 2011 plan.

But
by February 2009 he had received a letter from npower demanding he pay 
£332.93 or they would enter his house and cut off his gas and 
electricity supply.

Mr Osborn contacted the Energy Ombudsman before launching civil proceedings. He claimed Npower had breached its contract and Section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act.

David eventually accrued a ‘debt’ of 
£2,000 and the family received over 60 letters from npower and were 
repeatedly threatened with bailiffs.

The father was informed that the Price Fix 2011 had been withdrawn and 
he had instead been placed on the company's standard tariff

In his witness statement submitted to Bristol County Court in July, David said he felt 'bullied and intimidated' by npower.

He said: 'At no time in my life have I ever been in debt to anyone or any organisation.

'I have never used credit or hire purchase arrangements to acquire any goods or services (apart from my mortgage).

'I most certainly have never been on the receiving end of debt collection activities.

'I
can confirm that it is a horrible, demeaning and stressful experience 
to go through - and it is particularly frustrating when you know you 
have done nothing wrong and are not actually in debt, simply standing up
for a point of principle.'

Deputy District Judge O’Neill ruled at Bristol County Court in July that the contract was binding and Npower should pay £1,000 compensation.

A spokesman for Npower said it considered the court’s decision over the issue of harassment ‘to be in error’.

‘We settled with the customer, taking into account the time it took to resolve his complaint,’ he added.

'All issues have been reported back to the business to review its procedures.'

But David, who is the first person to successfully take npower to court, is still unhappy.

He said: 'They state that they consider the court’s decision to be in error.

'Well, if they didn’t like the court’s judgement there’s is a well-established mechanism in this country for appeal.

'It’s
disgraceful that a large organisation like npower can just cock a snoot
at a Court of Law and tell them that they’re wrong.'

He is now with First Utility, and is 'over the moon' with their services and his £143 monthly bill for their detached home.

Npower was fined £1.8million by watchdog OFGEM for mis-selling doorstep policies in December 2008.

After
originally saying that they believed the court's decision was 
erroneous, a spokesperson for Npower said in a statement: 'This was a 
genuine dispute over the tariff he originally signed up to npower with.

'We're pleased that the matter is now resolved and Mr Osborn has been compensated for the mis-selling of the tariff.

'We
always try to do the best by our customers and so we're sorry if we 
have upset Mr Osborn as this certainly was not our intention.'

A
spokeswoman for industry regulator Ofgem said: 'We aware of Mr Osborn's
dispute with npower and the Bristol County Court's judgment that, in 
that case, npower's behaviour amounted to a breach of the Protection 
from Harassment Act 1997.

'Under
Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, Ofgem has the power to take 
enforcement action in relation to failures to meet certain obligations, 
where there is harm to the collective interests of UK consumers.'
