When Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Jourdan Dunn stomped down the Burberry catwalk in THOSE blanket coats - a new AW14 style staple was born.

The wool blanket ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned with Apache-style zig zags were monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it. 

Since then, Sarah Jessica Parker, Olivia Palermo and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have been spotted in the luxurious  blanket scarves emblazoned with their initials.

Big, cosy scarves are big news this season - Chloe, Prabal Gurung, Sacai and DKNY's models all wrapped up warm in theirs on the runway. 

Vogue's catwalk edit describes them as the new 'wrap stars', with Helen Hibbird advising: 'Exquisite fabrics take this trend from sofa to street; look for double-faced cashmere and silk blends for the perfect drape.' 

Fashion editor and stylist Lisa Haynes mused: 'When I saw Cara and co. storming the Burberry Prorsum AW14 catwalk, I had instant bespoke blanket envy. The monogramming, showcased by CD (Cara Delevingne) and SW (Suki Waterhouse), gives the piece massive trophy appeal.

'If you can't afford the £895 Burberry price tag, look to the high street for a homage.' 

Men can wear them, too! Wayne Rooney, left, and Mark Wright show us how to work the look in red
