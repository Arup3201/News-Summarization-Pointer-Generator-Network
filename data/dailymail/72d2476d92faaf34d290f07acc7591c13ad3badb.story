Every little girl loves a doll’s house. But few are quite as exquisite as this miniature of a 19th Century building on Boulevard St Germain in Paris, occupied by a luxurious store and designer apartments. 

With dolls’ houses like this costing up to £100,000, it isn’t one you would want to let your toddler loose on.

The doll’s house boasts hand-made Venetian glass goblets and birch and lime wood interiors.

Proud creators: Art historians Susie and Ken spent a year working on the miniature, using a team of specialists from Italy, France and Spain to recreate the French store

Made by art historians Kevin Mulvany and Susie Rogers, it was commissioned by a private collector and recaptures a magical time in French history.

At 5½ft high by 3ft wide, the four-storey replica has silver and gold mouldings and fixtures, while everything from the tiny Prada and Chanel shoes to the marble table tops are faithful copies.

The couple, who live in Holt in Wiltshire, have been making miniatures and dolls’ houses for 30 years.

‘It took a year to complete,’ says Susie. ‘We like to leave our “calling card”. Our snaps are in some of the frames.’

Cut-glass accent: The miniatures glassware which fills the house is made of real Venetian glass - and can be seen on the tiny table next to a normal-sized goblet

Store windows: Left is a dummy in a designer dress topped with a pink, feathered hat; centre is a jumble of artefacts which make an artistic display; right a model poses in elegant clothes from a high mattress - the fabrics are hand-painted and the small basket contains miniature cutlery

Detailed: Pictured above is an ornate table - complete with pictures frame, a vase of flowers, a brush and a perfume bottle
