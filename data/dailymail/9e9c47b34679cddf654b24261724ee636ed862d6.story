He travels the world on official royal duty and sees more in a year than most do in lifetime. 

But could it be possible that the Prince of Wales does not know what a skip is?

Prince Charles was visiting the National Heritage Garden in the ground of Raymond Blanc's country house and restaurant yesterday when the subject of skips arose.

Prince Charles, pictured with Raymond Blanc, was visiting the National Heritage Garden in the ground of Raymond Blanc's country house and restaurant yesterday when the subject of skips arose

The Prince was shown the garden's compost heap, made out of old pallets, and was 'very interested' in the design - according to David Love Cameron, who won a competition to work in the garden for a year.

Mr Love Cameron told The Times: 'He loved the fact that we use shipping pallets, and wanted to know where you get them from.

'I said you could probably find some in a skip if you looked hard enough but I'm not quite sure he knew what a skip was.'

During his visit Prince Charles admired the way in which the garden's compost heap was constructed. 

He was told the design was made using old shipping pallets - but would he have known what a pallet was? 

When Dragons' Den star Hilary Devey appeared on The Graham Norton Show in 2011, she was forced to explain to bemused guests including Mcfly member Dougie Poynter what a pallet was.

The businesswoman, 57, made her fortune from pallet company, Pall-Ex.

During the visit the Prince enthusiastically inspected the vegetables growing in the garden and also revealed his favourite mushroom was the birch boletus.

The National Heritage Garden at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, has almost 140 rare specimens of vegetable including the Delicata squash and the Carruthers pea. 

The site was opened last June to showcase rare varieties of vegetables and educate people about gardening. 

It is run in partnership with garden Organic, and their Heritage Seed Library, which conserves vegetable varieties that would otherwise have disappeared.

The Prince, who has been a patron of garden organic for more than 25 years, was given some peas from Northern Ireland which had all but died out before being saved by gardeners.

Perplexed: Gardener David Love Cameron suggested Prince Charles appeared to not know what a skip was

He planted an organic fruit tree to commemorate the visit and was heard telling Raymond Blanc 'you're a genius' as he inspected the specimens, the BBC reports.

During the visit Prince Charles was also persuaded to taste the leaves of a plant called Stevia, a natural sweetener.

'He was completely amazed a plant could be so sweet.' said restaurateur Mr Blanc.
