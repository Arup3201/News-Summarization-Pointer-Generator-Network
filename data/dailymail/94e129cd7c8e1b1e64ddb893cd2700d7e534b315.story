A survey has found there has been a rekindling of a sense of British identity in Scotland - a blow to Alex Salmond, pictured, ahead of the Scottish independence referendum

More people in Scotland are describing themselves as British - and fewer as Scottish - as the campaign for independence turns off voters.

The Scottish Social Attitudes survey found that the number of people who say they are British has increased from 15 per cent in 2011 to 23 per cent, while those who say they are Scottish has dropped from 75 to 65 per cent.

The rekindling of a sense of British identity is the latest blow to Alex Salmond’s independence bid, just five weeks before the referendum on September 18.

It appears to be most pronounced in women, just 27 per cent of whom back separation, compared to 39 per cent of men. This 12 point gap between the sexes is double that of 2013.

The First Minister was routed in a TV debate against former chancellor Alistair Darling last Tuesday and has been struggling to turn around opinion polls that predict Scots will vote against breaking up the UK.

When respondents to the survey were presented with a range of options from ‘Scottish, not British’ to ‘British, not Scottish’, the most popular choice was ‘equally Scottish and British’ (32 per cent) – its highest level since 1999.

The number of people who said they were ‘British, not Scottish’, fell to 23 per cent, its lowest level in 15 years.

The annual survey of 1,339 people saw a small increase in support for independence in the last year, from 36 per cent to 39 per cent, but revealed growing anxiety about how a Yes vote would affect Scotland..

Some 38 per cent fear its voice in world would be weaker – up from a quarter in 2013 and 22 per cent in 2012.

While 44 per cent believe the economy would be worse – up from 34 per cent in both 2013 and 2012.

Mr Salmond’s blokeish attitude has been widely cited as a reason that women have been put off voting for independence.

John Curtice, co-director of the survey at ScotCen Social Research, said: ‘Although support for a Yes vote has increased during the last 12 months, more voters have in fact become nervous about the consequences of leaving the UK.

‘There are still insufficient voters who are of that view to deliver a majority for independence.’

Rachel Ormston, research director at ScotCen, said: ‘In the final weeks of the campaign, capturing women’s votes remains a key challenge, particularly for the Yes campaign.

‘Put off by uncertainty and less likely to be persuaded by patriotic arguments around “pride”, women still need to be convinced that independence will deliver on the economy and other areas.’

Mr Salmond yesterday predicted the independence referendum will attract the biggest turnout in Scotland’s history and draw people who have never voted before and do not feature in opinion polls.

The SNP leader, a former racing tipster, urged political punters to put their money on an unprecedented 80% turnout. 

In a wide ranging interview at Edinburgh Book Festival, Mr Salmond, a former RBS economist, pinned much of the blame for the collapse of the bank on English workers in its capital markets division.

‘There hasn’t ever been a single employee of that division working in Scotland,’ he said. ‘Every single person works in the market division in London.

‘Now I’m not saying that therefore the headquarters in Gogarburn (Edinburgh) are absolved of all the craziness that they engaged into. I’m just pointing out that to see RBS’s failure as a particularly Scottish matter is also wrong.’

While discussing the popularity of Scottish nationalism through history, he told how his father wanted Winston Churchill hanged.

He said: ‘My mum used to think Winston Churchill was the greatest man that ever lived.

‘My dad, of course, wanted to hang him. It was about what he did to the miners and things like that.

‘I remember once, and I’ve just done it again, when I was younger and more foolish as a politician I actually said that to a journalist and there was a headline saying: Salmond’s father wants to hang Churchill.

‘So I phoned my dad and said: “You probably saw the headline, I really shouldn’t have said that.”

‘He said: “No you shouldn’t, did I teach you nothing? Hanging was too good for that man.”’
