Christmas is for kids and the giant retail stores are using to that to their advantage with fuzzy heartwarming commercials to tug at the heartstrings of both the youngsters and their parents who are filling their stockings this year.

Australian retail giant David Jones has just released an ever-so-cute commercial that will soften the hardest of festive Scrooges with the marketing ploy being compared to the fuzzy ad by U.K. department store John Lewis which has already amassed 15 million hits on YouTube.

Although, the DJ's video has only attracted a mere 100,000 views so far - they both have a similar theme of emotions running through the two campaigns with both telling an adorable story about a little boy's innocent imagination in the lead-up to Christmas.

The new David Jones Christmas commercial tells of a boy who is concerned his house doesn't have a chimney for Santa to go down on Christmas Eve

He wakes one morning to discover his loungeroom has a makeshift fireplace - thanks to his parents

He was even more delighted to see a chimney on his roof in the The Things We Do For Love campaign

David Jones tells the story of a little boy concerned that Santa won't visit his house on Christmas Eve because there isn't a chimney for him to go down. 

He makes his own out of collecting sticks and tying them together before innovatively placing the chimney on top of his cubby house but – alas it falls and crashes to the ground.

But never fear - The Things We Do For Love campaign - ends with his parents making him a fireplace and chimney out of cardboard – much to his overwhelming delight.

The adorable factor is on par with the John Lewis commercial - Monty the penguin – who is the best friend of a little boy.

The inseparable pair watch TV, play Lego, jump on the trampoline and go out on day trips together.

But Monty starts to notice many in love couples and begins to pine for his own partner.

However, all is not lost as his bestest buddy buys Monty a penguin mate which pops out of a present from under the tree on Christmas morning.

Mumbrella is putting the two warm and fuzzy campaigns head to head to see which commercials makes viewers the most gooey on the inside by using a piece of technology called RealEyes tool to monitor the level of emotion felt by the viewer while watching the ad
