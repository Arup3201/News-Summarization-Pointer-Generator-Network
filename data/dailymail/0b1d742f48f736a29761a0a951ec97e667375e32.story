These distressing pictures show a skeletal lurcher found roaming the streets just days from death in one of the worst neglect cases ever seen by an RSPCA inspector.

The dog, whose rib cage and spine can clearly be seen, was completely emaciated, had suffered fur loss and was covered in fleas when she was found with a Jack Russell.

The mismatched pair, who both appear to have been abandoned, are believed to have stumbled across each other in the wild where they formed a close bond.

Neglect: This skeletal lurcher was found roaming the streets just days from death alongside a Jack Russell

The dog, whose rib cage and spine can clearly be seen, was completely emaciated when she was rescued by the RSPCA

Neither the lurcher (pictured) or the Jack Russell were microchipped or wearing collars, suggesting they may have been abandoned

The dogs were discovered in Bransgore, in New Forest, Hampshire, earlier this week and were not microchipped or wearing collars. 

RSPCA Inspector Patrick Bailey said: 'I have come across some pretty poorly dogs in my time as an inspector but I can safely say there have been few that have been as thin as this poor lurcher.

'She was completely emaciated, and looked to be just skin stretched over bone.

'She had fur loss from her shoulders down, was absolutely covered in fleas and her claws were long and overgrown.

'From her body condition I really don't think she had many days left had she not been found.

'We dread to think what would've happened to these dogs had they not been found.'

The lurcher was found with a Jack Russell (pictured) in New Forest, Hampshire, and the pair have formed a close bond

Recovering: It may be some weeks before the poorly lurcher is in a fit enough state to be re-homed

An RSPCA inspector said he had never seen a dog as thin and emaciated as the lurcher, which was found earlier this week

The dogs, who are both female, are now recovering however it could be some time before the lurcher is in a fit enough state to find a new family.

Because of their bond, the canine companions could be re-homed together, but this may not be the possible because the Jack Russell is likely to be healthy enough to be re-homed sooner.

Mr Bailey added: 'We don't know how long these dogs have been straying and we don't know how they got there or where they came from.

'It seems unusual that the two dogs were so polar opposite in their health and wellbeing and as such I am keen to hear from anyone who can offer information regarding them, especially the lurcher. 

'It is possible that these dogs have been straying independently before joining up to form this mismatched pair and it could be that the lurcher has been fending for herself for quite some time to arrive in this poor condition.

'However she is extremely affectionate, enjoys fuss and attention and seems very keen to be around people.

'She has clearly been socialised but I cannot rule out the possibility that she has been neglected before straying or possibly even being dumped.' 

The RSPCA is appealing for the owner or owners of the duo to come forward so they can be reunited, or for anyone with details about where they may have come from to contact them.
