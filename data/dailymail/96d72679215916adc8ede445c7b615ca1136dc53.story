Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

In Spain, AS leads with the news that Real Madrid are set to announce the signing of goalkeeper Keylor Navas.

The 27-year-old shone for Costa Rica at the World Cup as the surprise package of the tournament reached the quarter-finals in Brazil.

AS reports that the transfer from La Liga outfit Levante has been agreed and that Navas could be presented as Carlo Ancelotti's latest signing on Thursday.

Navas' signing means the Bernabeu club will have three goalkeepers  - but that may change with Iker Casillas and Diego Lopez both linked with moves away from the Spanish capital.

Fellow Madrid-based publication Marca leads with an interview from Real midfielder Luka Modric.

The Croatian believes the 10-time European champions are even better than last season following the additions of James Rodriguez and World Cup winner Toni Kroos.

Following the death of Real legend Alfredo di Stefano earlier this month, the 28-year-old added that 'there is no better way to honour Di Stefano than maintain his winning philosophy' next season.

Elsewhere Mundo Deportivo focuses on the £15.8million signing of Jeremy Mathieu to Barcelona from Valencia.

The defender, who hailed the Nou Camp outfit as the 'best in the world' is the fifth purchase of new boss Luis Enrique's reign.

The 30-year-old will meet his new team-mates on Friday, Mundo adds, as the Catalan outfit continue their pre-season preparations.

Over in Italy, the inquest in their disappointing World Cup campaign continues as candidate for FIGC President Demetrio Albertini has run through his plans to change the face of Italian football.

The Azzurri are reassessing their football philosophies after they exited at the group stage of the World Cup for a second successive tournament with one of the former AC Milan's proposals being a reform of the the leagues.

Elsewhere Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport focus heavily on the transfer rumours that are sweeping through Italy's top flight.

Tuttosport report that Verona midfielder Romulo is set to sign for Serie A champions Juventus as the two clubs agree a £7.9million fee for the 27-year-old.

Corriere dello Sport headlines that Roma are set to swoop for Davide Astori.

The Cagliari centre-back had been in advanced with their bitter rivals Lazio about a move to the Stadio Olmpico but instead signed a new contract at his present club.

However, in a shock twist Sky Sport Italia claim the contract extension is just so that Roma can take Astori on loan for £1.6million with an option to buy at the end of the season for a further £4.7million.
