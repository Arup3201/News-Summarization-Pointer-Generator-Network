Victim: Police have identified Vaibhev Loomba as the man who was found dead at Zeta Psi house in Berkeley, California, Sunday

A 20-year-old man was discovered dead at a fraternity near University of California at Berkeley following a party Saturday night.

Police said they got a 911 call at around 12.10pm Sunday about an unresponsive male at 2728 Bancroft Way, the home of the Zeta Psi Greek organization.

The victim has been identified by police as 20-year-old Vaibhev Loomba, an engineering student at University of California at Davis.

The young man was found unresponsive in one of the upstairs rooms inside the frat house. 

Paramedics who responded to the address pronounced him dead at the scene.

Loomba was said to be one of about 100 guests who attended the party organized by Zeta Psi Saturday night. He was not a member of the fraternity.

Lt Ed Spiller said police have classified the death as 'suspicious.' Drugs and alcohol have not been ruled out as contributing factors.

‘We err on the side of caution, so we deem it suspicious until we can prove otherwise,’ Spiller told KTVU, adding that homicide detectives are looking into the case.

No time of death has been given since investigators are not sure how long the 20-year-old had been dead before officers arrived.

A witness told the local independent news site Berkeleyside that Vaibhev Loomba was discovered lying face down on the floor with vomit around his mouth.

Sad end: The victim's body was removed by the coroner's office after a four-hour investigation 

Loomba's friends have been posting tributes on Facebook in memory of the seemingly popular engineering student.

'One of the most genuine guys I know, gone far too soon,' wrote Michael Riel. 'Save me a spot up there.'

Loomba's high school friend Aidan Maguire shared a photo of himself posing with Loomba dressed as the Disney character Aladdin, writing on his Facebook page: ‘One of the greatest guys I may ever know. Always making me laugh and radiating positivity wherever he went. May he rest in peace and be forever remembered.’

According to his LinkedIn page, Loomba studied engineering at UC Davis and was expected to graduate in 2016. He was also the founder and CFO of a non-profit organization he had started with a relative last year.

The Zeta Psi fraternity is not recognized by UC Berkeley. According to students and police, it has a reputation for throwing large, often very rowdy parties attended by hundreds of people.

Police say they have been called to the off-campus fraternity house in the past.

As recently as October, officers shut down an out-of-control gathering hosted by Zeta Psi.

Following the incident, city officials posted a notice outside the frat house door warning of a $750 fine if there were additional violations.

On Monday, Zeta Psi released a statement addressing the fatality near the UC Berkeley campus.

‘The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated by the appropriate authorities. Until the investigation is complete, Zeta Psi will not comment on the details of this incident. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of this young man.’
