Colette Wilson, 48, stole £788,340 from IT solutions company Boxing Orange Limited in Leeds

A woman stole more than £750,000 from her employers and used it to fund a luxury lifestyle, splashing out on a horse arena, a Range Rover and £25,000 on her daughter's 16th birthday party.

Colette Wilson, 48, from Otley, in West Yorkshire, stole £788,340 from IT solutions company Boxing Orange Limited in Leeds to pay for her extravagance.

She was jailed for four years at Leeds Crown Court today after admitting theft through falsifying the company's accounts.

A court heard how Wilson blew the company's cash on regular beauty treatments, an extension to her home in Pudsey, bought horses costing more than £50,000 and spent £71,000 on a horse arena.

Wilson also spent thousands on designer clothing for herself and bought a Range Rover for £40,000 which she later part exchanged for a more expensive model. She also bought a car for her daughter and both enjoyed treatments at various salons.

David Dixon, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court that her lavish living was financed by her dishonesty while employed as company secretary and financial controller for Boxing Orange Limited.  

She worked for the IT company for eight years in 'complete control of the finances', earning £37,000 a year, but her theft came to light in 2011 when the company was taken over by another firm, Accumuli PLC.

An audit revealed that documents had been manipulated to hide her dishonesty. 

She initially tried to blame others and put the former company directors under suspicion, but enquiries revealed money had been paid into both her and her daughter's accounts.

It then emerged she had got the job in the first place in 2003 through the recommendation of a friend as honest and trustworthy, neither that person nor the directors were aware Wilson had previously been to jail for fraud.

Mr Dixon told the court in 1997 she received 12 months in prison for dishonestly taking funds belonging to her then employers.

When she was arrested by police in 2011 at her home in Pudsey, she claimed to think the money was rightfully hers because she had been one of the top employees. 

Inquiries into her finances showed a total of £44,000 had been paid to a builder for work on her home and for her daughter's 16th birthday party at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Leeds.

Mr Dixon told the court: 'She had also spent £71,000 on a horse area. No expense was spared on the project. She bought horses including one for £20,000. Her total horse related purchases ran to £139,141. 

'She also had an extension on her home at the price of £25,000. 

'She became a customer at a shop called Rag Doll spending £100,000 on designer clothing and bought a variety of cars including a Range Rover.'

Mr Dixon said Wilson also spent the money on home interiors, cash and foreign currency and trips to salons with her daughter. She also spent  £25,000 on a birthday party for her daughter at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Leeds.

Mr Dixon said she had repaid £119,000, but £668,347.50 remained outstanding.

However, because she had now been declared bankrupt, no further money could be recovered.

He said: 'Her criminal proceeds were used to fund a high lifestyle and seem in part to be because she believed herself more worthy than the company was paying her. This is a clear case of greed.'

Gillian Batts, representing Wilson, said she was remorseful and realised she had let people down. She had not felt able to tell her family the details of what she had done.

Wilson initially failed to turn up to court today, claiming she couldn't find anyone to look after her dogs, and so a warrant was issued for her arrest.

Recorder Tim Gittins told her during sentencing: 'The face is what you gave with one hand you took surreptitiously with the other on a grand scale.

'It's clear from what I've seen from the forensic enquiries that it was spent on high living - nothing more and nothing less.

'You took an obscene amount of money to spent on your daughter's birthday party. No doubt she was delighted at the time but would be horrified to learn of your dishonesty.

'Following your conviction there will be publicity which means you will be shamed with all eyes on your family and friends.' 

The successful investigation was led by City of London Police, which takes the lead in many of the most high profile fraud cases.

Det Insp Heather Dalton said Wilson abused her position of trust and conned some of those closest to her.

She said: 'They trusted her completely and she betrayed that. It is amazing she got so far.'
