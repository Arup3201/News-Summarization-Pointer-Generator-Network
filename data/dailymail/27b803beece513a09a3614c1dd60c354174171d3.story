An eyewitness account of Lawrence of Arabia’s Arab revolt is among an archive of previously unseen papers about the expedition due to go under the hammer in London next month.

In one letter never sent, the British officer leader immortalised by Peter O’Toole in David Lean’s epic film about the crusade, is congratulated by his superior officer for 'your tremendous results and no one else could have done it.'

The historical collection written by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe is expected to fetch up to £30,000 and consists of three Army Field Service Correspondence Books issued to officers to record their activities, enemy positions and deployments.

It also includes a wealth of papers and letters to colleagues including T. E. Lawrence who remained close friends with Newcombe, up until his death in a motorcycle accident in Dorset in 1935.

Book specialist Matthew Haley, of Bonham’s in London where the stash is due to go under the hammer on March 19, said: 'The Newcombe diaries have never been seen before and are a major addition to understanding both of Lawrence and of the relationship between the British and the local leaders of the Arab Revolt at this crucial period.'

They cover the guerrilla operations in 1917 to disable the strategically important Hejaz Railway and to tie up Ottoman troops in its defence.

The Ottoman Empire had entered the First World War in November 1914 on the German side in the hope of recapturing lost territories, including parts of modern-day Jordan and Saudi Arabia

The British, fearful of the impact on oil fields in the Middle East, fought alongside Arab nationalists, most notably Prince Faisal, who wanted to drive the Turks from his land in modern Saudi Arabia, specifically from the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.

Faisal went on to become king of Iraq, while his brother Abdullah was the first king of Jordan.

A letter dated July 10 1917, which provides an insight both into Newcombe’s style and the type of war he was waging, read: 'I’m just back from a stunt with Joyce & Davenport: we had to go 32 miles to the railway without water & of course return at once. We broke 450 rails on 6th night 7th morning at kilo 1027, just N. of Seil Matran.

'Davenport has now gone to a well we dug in W. Jezzil, nearer the railway & should destroy 3 to 400 rails more or less nightly.'

Bonham’s spokesman Andrew Currie said Joyce and Davenport would have been fellow British officers working with Newcombe.

Reflecting on those times in his autobiography Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Lawrence, who was an intelligence officer with the rank of captain at the time, wrote of his friend and colleague: 'Newcombe had constant difficulties from his excess of zeal, and his habitual doing four times what any other Englishman would do, and ten times what the Arabs thought needful or wise.

Newcombe is like fire... he burns friend and enemy.'

According to Lawrence, Newcombe wore out Prince Faisal’s best camels with his constant to-ing and fro-ing.

A letter written to Lawrence by Newcombe but never sent shows the closeness between the two men.

It read: 'I’ve always regretted just having missed you when you first went to Abdulla’s and again early in May: and it made a great difference to my shows not having you with Faisal to back me up and buck him up.

'Anyway I very sincerely congratulate you on your tremendous results and no one else could have done it. We others can’t disguise the fact that we are British & its no use trying to be unnaturally Arab when one can’t: and I’ve not succeeded.'

Mr Currie said Abdullah was a 'significant figure' as he was among the leaders of the Arab revolt, and later became the first King of Jordan.

He said: 'We do not know why the correspondence praising Lawrence was not dispatched by Newcombe.

'He could have thought better of it. But they would have been moving around the whole time and it may just be he never got around to it. But for whatever reason, Lawrence never actually saw it.'

Mr Currie said the auction is expected to attract bids from British and overseas collectors because Lawrence was such an important figure, as well as museums eager to get their hands on the material.

But the death of Peter O’Toole who shot to fame playing him in the 1962 Oscar winning movie Lawrence of Arabia was unlikely to attract additional interest.

Mr Currie said: 'He is so famous I do not think that will play any part in increasing attention around the auction. He is like Churchill, there will be alot of international appeal, especially in the Arab world.'

Stewart Newcombe and TE Lawrence first met in 1913. Lawrence was godfather to the Newcombes’ first child and Newcombe was one of the pall bearers at Lawrence’s funeral.

The archive has remained with the family since Lt Col Newcombe’s death in 1956.
