A 58-year-old Nebraska woman was sentenced to 30 days in jail after admitting killing her own family dog.

Judy Lloyd, from Columbus, was sentenced on Friday for animal mistreatment.

Prosecutors said Lloyd intentionally ran over the 15 to 20 pound dog last July.

How could she? Lloys told the judge she was fearful of the family dog getting loose. The 15- to 20-pound dog had a history of attacking children and behaving aggressively on previous occasions

Lloyd apologized at her sentencing saying she was worried the dog would attack a child.

She told the court the dog had a history of behaving aggressively.

'I just want to tell the court I'm very very sorry. I couldn’t cope,' she said, wiping tears from her eyes. 'I just didn't know what else to do.'

She said she knew her actions in killing the pet had caused pain to the members of her extended family.

Lloyd is the owner of several dogs including a black cocker spaniel, but that pet apparently did not show anywhere near the same level of aggression as her other white cross-bred dog.

Does this dog look aggressive? The defenseless pooch was tied to a wooden pallet in the woods and then deliberately run over. Lloyd ran over the dog multiple times with her car, put the body in a sack and disposed of it in the Lost Creek drainage canal

Apology: 'I couldn't cope', Lloyd said. 'I just didn't know what else to do.' Here Judy Lloyd is seen holding one of her other dogs which is still alive

An investigation by Platte County 
Sheriff’s Deputy Tom Brandl described Lloyd as being 'very concerned' 
about the dog’s aggressiveness and that the city woman decided to 
euthanize the animal herself.

Prosecutors said Lloyd took the 15-to-20 
pound dog to a rural area and tied it to a wooden pallet before running 
over the dog several times. She disposed of the body in a drainage 
canal. 

The dog's body was never found.

Lloyd could have been sent to jail for up to year along with a $1,000 fine so her 30 day sentence is light when compared to the possible maximum penalties she could have faced.
