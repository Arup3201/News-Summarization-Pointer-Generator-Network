Laboour branded the Tories 'the political wing of the hedge fund industry'

Labour branded the Tories ‘the political wing of the hedge fund industry’ as the latest figures underlined their dependence on donations from City figures.

Almost £2 million of Tory donations in the last quarter of last year came from hedge fund donors – and three Tory donors were named last week as having previously held accounts at the Swiss branch of HSBC.

Hedge funds have defended themselves against criticism from Ed Miliband, arguing that they contributed £4 billion in British taxes last year. But Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘The Tories are now the political wing of the hedge fund industry.

‘The Tory election campaign is increasingly reliant on those who dine exclusively at the Prime Minister’s top table and a select few from the world of finance. The Tories’ plan is failing working families because their priority has been to help a few at the top.’

The biggest Conservative donors were Michael Gooley, founder of travel company Trailfinders, who gave £500,000; Lord Glendonbrook, the former owner of BMI (£334,000); and David Rowland, a property magnate (£322,000). The three donors named as having had accounts with the Swiss Branch of HSBC were Georg Von Opel, who gave £105,900; Edward Lee (£17,200) and Anwar Pervez (£8,000.

Being a client of a Swiss bank is not against the law, and does not prove tax avoidance or evasion. There is no suggestion that any of the individual donors did anything unlawful.

The Electoral Commission figures also reveal that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has donated more than £500,000 to the three main political parties through one of his companies.

Bloomberg TradeBook, a British-registered financial markets broker, has given £240,000 to Labour, £210,000 to the Liberal Democrats and £100,000 to the Conservatives since January 2011. Including gifts in kind, the company has almost doubled its political donations in the past four years to £640,704, compared with £369,567 in the four years ahead of the 2010 election.

Mr Bloomberg, whose ex-wife is from England, has called Britain his second home. Mr Bloomberg declined to comment last night.
