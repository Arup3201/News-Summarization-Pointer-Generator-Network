A letter from the man accused of opening fire on a Pennsylvania State Police barracks - killing one trooper and injuring another - to his parents has been revealed.

Eric Frein admitted killing a trooper because he was dissatisfied with government and wanted to 'wake people up,' according to court documents filed Thursday that provided the first indication of a possible motive.

Frein spoke of wanting to start a revolution in the letter to his parents and called the slaying of Cpl. Bryon Dickson an 'assassination' in a police interview after his October 30 capture, the documents said.

Court documents filed Thursday also included a letter, which authorities say was written by Frein and was addressed to 'Mom and Dad.'

The letter says 'Our nation is far from what it was and what it should be. I have seen so many depressing changes made in my time that I cannot imagine what it must be like for you. There is so much wrong and on so many levels only passing through the crucible of another revolution can get us back the liberties we once had. I do not pretend to know what that revolution will look like or even if it would be successful. 

Suspect: Eric Frein (seen in this October 30 mug shot) has been charged with terrorism. Authorities have said that Frein wrote a letter to his parents, in which he spoke of wanting to start a revolution 

Charged: Frein, seen on October 31, is charged with the murder of Pennsylvania State Trooper Cpl. Byron Dickson and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass

'Tension is high at the moment and the time seems right for a spark to ignite a fire in the hearts of men. What I have done has not been done before and it felt like it was worth a try.

'If I am dead I would like to be buried in a wood casket (no lead lined casket!) so that my remains can return to where they came from. I realize that this may not be possible though, laws and what not, so don't sweat it. Also, light a candle for me at the Russian or Greek Orthodox church in Stroudsburg from time to time. It doesn't need to be during a liturgy, just whenever they are open. I am sure you can figure it out.

'I do not have a death wish but I know the odds. I tried my best to do this thing without getting identified, but if you are reading this then I was not successful. If I am still alive and free know that I will do my best to remain as such. And as time goes by, if circumstances change, if my spark hit good tinder, then I may be able to return one day.

'I am sorry. You guys are great parents, I am just not a good son. I squandered so much opportunity and support and rarely tried my best at anything. God knows I do not deserve the things I had, maybe He knew I would be sacrificing all of it in the end, or maybe this is just the final squander. Who knows.

'I love you. Please forgive me of my many faults. And thanks for putting up with me for so long.'

Scene: Debris is strewn about the main room inside the airport hangar on November 4 on abandoned Birchwood Resort grounds in Pocono Township, Pennsylvania where Eric Frein was arrested

Search: Authorities launched an extensive manhunt to find Frein 

State police charged Frein on Thursday with two counts of terrorism. He already faced first-degree murder and other counts in the September 12 ambush, which killed Dickson, seriously wounded another trooper and sparked a 48-day manhunt in the Pocono Mountains.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Frein, who appeared by video at a brief hearing at which state police filed the additional charges. He has not entered a plea.

On the night of his capture, Frein waived his right to remain silent and told police in an interview at the barracks that he had shot the troopers 'because he wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was inefficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for,' according to a criminal complaint. 'The defendant further acknowledged taking action (shooting the troopers) to wake people up because it was all he could do.'

Police found the letter on a storage drive inside an abandoned airplane hangar that authorities believe Frein used as a shelter. The letter was created on December 29, 2013, and was last accessed on October 6, 2014, while Frein was on the run, the documents said. Police have said Frein had a laptop with him.

Authorities, meanwhile, say they're not worried that Frein's confession could conceivably be challenged by defense attorneys.

Police refused to tell Frein that his family had hired an attorney for him the night he was captured, according to defense attorney James Swetz, who said he was prevented from seeing Frein at the barracks.

'I was told, "He's an adult and has not asked for a lawyer,"' Swetz recounted earlier this week.

District Attorney Ray Tonkin has cited Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent that says police aren't required to tell a suspect that an attorney is seeking to speak with him or her. A more recent state court decision, however, said the Supreme Court had not 'eliminated the possibility' that a defendant's due-process rights could be violated under similar circumstances.
