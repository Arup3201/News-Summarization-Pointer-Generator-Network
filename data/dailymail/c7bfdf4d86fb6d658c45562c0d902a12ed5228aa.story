A Romanian MP was stunned after a family of millionaire gypsies moved into his mansion after he was late paying back a loan secured on a 20 percent share in his property, and the bank sold it off to the gypsies to recover the debt.

It meant that the gypsies who snapped up the 20 percent stake in the property in the north-eastern Romanian city of Iasi moved into part of it overnight, and since then have allegedly made MP Ionel Agrigoroaei's life hell.

He said: 'It was bought by an 18-year-old gypsy and his family and nobody seems to be asking where he got the money from to pay the bank.'

Intimidation: Members of the gypsy family that have moved in to the MP's house. It's not clear if all of those pictured have been involved in the alleged campaign of terror

And if the 53-year-old MP was unhappy about seeing the gypsies move into a wing of his property, he was even more unhappy when they started a catalogue of what he describes as terror and intimidation in a bid to get him to move out so they could occupy the rest of the building.

Details of the case were revealed in papers filed by Agrigoroaei at court and with local police from which he also requested protection. He said he also made the same request to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Gabriel Oprea.

The intimidation included the discovery one morning that the gypsies had made a hole as a grave in his back garden, and warned him that he would soon be filling it.

Violent: Alleged ringleader Vandam Constantin was apparently filmed on CCTV attacking representatives of a car service

Vandam is said to have posted pictures of his son online with what looks like a handgun

Bragging: Vandam apparently also posted a picture of his baby covered in money on the internet

Agrigoroaei said: 'I feel very much that my life is in danger and that of my wife. Only last week they told my wife Antonela it was a shame she was going to die so young. And they told my brother Danut they would paralyse him and that he should stay away from me.

'In the past few weeks I've been threatened with death or I was told I would be left paralysed at least 30 times. It is clear they want me to leave the house so they can use the whole building.'

MP Agrigoroaei said that the grave and the other threats were being coordinated by 18-year-old gypsy Vandam Constantin. According to locals his family wanted to name him after Jean-Claude Van Damme, but because none of them could spell properly the baby had ended up with the name Vandam.

The Piraeus Bank that sold the stake in the property has declined to comment on the case. There is also currently no investigation as to where the teenager, who apparently has no income, managed to find 37,000 euros (£29,000) to pay for it.

He said: 'The police don't have to look very hard for proof of the intimidation, they are even conducting the campaign online.'

For example, Vandam recently posted on Facebook: 'Any beginning has an end, but for some people the end will be tragic.'

He also posted snaps of his son with what looks like a real handgun and with bundles of cash.

It is not Vandam's first brush with the law. The 18-year-old was in the middle of another scandal in March when he attacked the employees of a car service firm with an axe after they asked him why he had crossed into an employee only service area and was rummaging through things.

Even though a complaint by the car firm included CCTV images backing up the allegation, the complaint was later withdrawn after the manager suddenly changed their mind and police were forced to drop the matter.

And last year he reportedly attacked a barber with a knife because he did not like the haircut he got.
