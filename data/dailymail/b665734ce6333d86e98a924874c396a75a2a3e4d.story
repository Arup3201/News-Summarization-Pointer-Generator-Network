Casey Anthony has broken her almost year-long silence to conduct the first interview since her acquittal in July last year for the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee by declaring that 'I didn't kill my daughter...but I'm ashamed of the person that I was.'

Talking to CNN's Piers Morgan before he spoke to her attorney J. Cheney Mason on his 'Piers Morgan Tonight' show, the most reviled mother in America denied murdering her child and acknowledged that, 'The public perception of me is bad, absolutely horrible.'

Reading aloud the transcripts of his 'world exclusive' chat with hated Anthony, Morgan revealed that the 26-year-old denies reports she has put on massive amounts of weight and refuted any suggestions she was moving to Costa Rica.

Casey Anthony's last public appearance was in October in a YouTube diary she posted online. She spoke today to CNN's Piers Morgan

'I do not weigh 500 pounds and I am not moving to Costa Rica,' said Anthony to Morgan in a telephone conversation that Mason was present for prior to his appearance on CNN.

'It's doubtful she weighs 120 pounds,' said Mason.

Telling Morgan that she was 'not a party girl' and that she had, 'never done drugs apart from marijuana in my early 20's,' Anthony was keen to set the record straight.

Telling Morgan that she 'had gone through hell' since her July 2011 acquittal, the 26-year-old impressed the CNN host with what he called her new-found maturity.

'Obviously, I didn't kill my daughter. If anything in this world I was 
more proud of was my daughter. She was my greatest accomplishment. I 
didn't kill my girl,' explained Anthony to Morgan.

Heading off any suggestions that CNN might have paid Anthony for the interview, Morgan sought clarification from her.

'I'm not making gazillions dollars,' said Anthony.

'I don't give an expletive about money... I may have in past... I was a stupid kid. I am 
26 now. I have gone through hell.'

However, her attorney Mason did add: 'We are sitting back watching. ... When the time comes she will have her story to tell.'

During the aired twenty minute segment, Morgan revealed a snapshot of Anthony's life since she was acquitted of the murder of her two-year old daughter Caylee in July 2011.

Cut off from everyday life, Anthony told Morgan that she spends each day at home cooking, cleaning, exercising and watching television.

Admitting to Morgan that she has come to love old comedy shows such as 'The Three Stooges' and 'I Love Lucy', Anthony also said that she enjoys reading fiction, especially 'The Hunger Games' trilogy in which children fight to the death in televised contests.

'She doesn't watch the news. She doesn't watch these so-called reality 
shows that are about as real as wrestling.,' said Mason.

'She's reading a trilogy of 
books called 'Hunger Games.' .. She's very interested in photography, 
works out a lot, likes 'I Love lucy,' 'The Three Stooges,' travel.'

Granting the exclusive telephone conversation to CNN's Morgan, Anthony was explicit on how she feels about the public's perception of her during and after the trial.

'It's horrible. It looks absolutely horrible, and I'm ashamed in many ways of the person that I was," Anthony said over the phone. 'Even then, that wasn't who I am.'

Responding to these comments, her attorney was keen to say Anthony has not had the chance to explain herself.

'Casey had a bad background. Lot of problems with her history that don't need to be talked about now,' said Mason.

'Indeed, she didn't trust anybody.

'In Casey-world she made things up, she denied things but she just closed in. She just had a very difficult time dealing with it.

'She is now trying to emerge from that.

'She learned at the same time a lot of the world did how she grieves differently after her child disappeared and an expert explained that.'

Mason made it clear that despite earning her freedom, Anthony's life is not free.

'She is in a different prison,' said Mason.

'She can't go outside.

'She spends the day in the house, cooks, cleans, exercises, watches programs on TV, movies mostly.'

Discussing his conversation with Anthony to Mason, Piers Morgan said that he was struck by her self-awareness of her situation.

'She accepts reality,' said Mason.

'She knows that the hate mongers are out there in their legions.'

'She has to accept that people hate her.

'She gets a lot of favourable mail too.'

Asking Mason if Anthony would ever consider becoming a mother again, her attorney was equivocal.

'She probably would. It would take a long time [though] for her to be accepted.'

Anthony is currently on probation in Florida as she awaits a check on a fraud conviction, but the
court has ordered her exact location to be kept a secret because of death threats.

Since going into hiding, Anthony has appeared only occasionally in online video diaries that have been leaked.

In one online posting, she discussed her new blond bob hair style, having her 
nose pierced, and her new pet dog.

Other images on the Internet showed 
Anthony in a bar.

In none of these appearances was her daughter mentioned.

It was initially speculated that Anthony
could command up to $750,000 for her first exclusive interview 
following her trial, but the big four national networks and cable news 
declined to pay that sum.

The infamous Florida mother, had teamed up with Los Angeles-based TV producer Scott Sternberg to pitch an interview to all the networks.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the interview had a price tag of $500,000 to $750,000, but CBS News, ABC News and NBC News all stated they would not pay for an interview with Anthony.

Recent reports have revealed that Anthony has been forced to leave her South Florida hiding place and go on the run after her location was discovered by private investigators.

It has also been reported that 26-year-old Anthony has lost her looks because she has put on so much weight that she has become virtually unrecognisable.

The private investigators who discovered where she has been hiding were said to have been hired by Zenaida Gonzalez, who is suing the 'tot mom' for defamation.

A source told RadarOnline: 'Casey absolutely flipped out when she found out that private investigators hired by Zenaida Gonzalez, discovered where she was.

'The private investigators were attempting to serve Casey with a subpoena to appear at the trial, which is expected to begin in January.

'Casey had been venturing out at night and the investigators had been tipped off by people who had seen her.'Casey is a smart girl and quickly determined that she had been found and refused to leave the house or accept service of the subpoena.

'The P.I.s weren't stalking her or doing any surveillance, they just wanted to serve her and move on.

'Casey was extremely upset that she had been found because she had settled into a routine and felt safe in South Florida.

'Casey's lawyer advised her that she needed to move though and they worked together over the past two weeks to move yet again. She is hopeful this will be the final move before her probation ends, at which time, she doesn't have to stay in Florida.'

After her dramatic acquittal, Anthony spent months in hiding where she reportedly just sits indoors on the computer while comfort eating - and so has piled on the pounds.

But a source has revealed that this new look - including a 'puffy face' - has apparently given her fresh courage as she has been leaving her home regularly.

'Casey has been venturing out on a much more frequent basis recently because she is almost unrecognisable,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She hasn't needed to wear a disguise because of the physical transformation.'

The source added that she has turned to comfort eating and pops out at night to rent films and collect food from restaurants - but won't stay anywhere too long.

'Casey doesn't feel safe anywhere and just wants to leave the country and begin a new life,' the source added.

It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning.
