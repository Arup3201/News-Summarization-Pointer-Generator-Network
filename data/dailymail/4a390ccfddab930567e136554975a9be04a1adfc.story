Surfing was virtually non-existent in Iran when Easkey Britton first traveled to the 'ultra-conservative' country in 2010.

The Irish surfer expected to face anger and disapproval in the Muslim nation where televising female sports is forbidden. Just last year,  a woman was jailed simply for watching a men's volleyball match.

But the 29-year-old was shocked to discover a welcoming country as eager to learn the sport as she was to teach them.

Overwhelmed by the reaction she returned three years later with filmmaker Marion Poizeau and two female Iranian athletes - professional snowboarder Mona Seraji and diver Shahla Yasini.  

Marion's documentary 'Into the Sea' charts their incredible journey to the shores of Baluchistan, an area considered so deadly 'even Iranians don't go there'.

Champion: Easkey Britton (pictured) was introduced to surfing by her father at the tender age of four and won the Irish National Surfing Championships four consecutive times by 2008

Marion told MailOnline: 'In Tehran, people were saying you're crazy to go to Baluchistan because it's considered a very dangerous place.

'So when I screened my film in the capital, people were saying we didn't know you could go to Baluchistan and come back alive.'

Despite its fearsome reputation as a site of brutal secular fighting between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, there is little alternative to the region's 60-mile stretch of sand and five foot waves. For the country's surf-obsessed, it is becoming a necessary pilgrimage.

A large crowd began to gather during Mona and Shahla's first lesson under Easkey's expert guidance.

They predicted some opposition in the remote section of a largely male-dominated country, but the locals in Chabahar were simply intrigued.

Women are allowed to wear bathing suits in Iran's female-only swimming pools and baths, but traditional head-coverings are mandatory on public beaches where men are present. 

Hundreds stormed the beach to watch the three women riding the waves in their wet-suits and hijabs. And soon the Baluchi locals were begging to take part themselves. 

The growth of the sport means 'Baluchi girls and women are no longer on the sidelines' according to Easkey, a five-time national champion in her native Ireland.

She added: 'Fathers are asking me to take their daughters surfing. 

'What is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here, with the young women playing an important change-making role, leading the way in a new frontier sport, writing a new narrative full of possibility despite being ignored by the world outside and limited by the constraints of their own country.' 

Parting gift: Easkey (pictured) presented her surfboard to local lawmaker Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'It (sport) is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors'

But her first surf with Mona and Shahla caused quite a stir and when the village elders and a 'powerful' member of parliament requested to meet them Easkey expected the worst.

She was again overwhelmed by the tolerance shown by Yaqoub Jadgal, who said: 'Islam recommends sports, which are beneficial both physically and spiritually. It is not just for men, women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors.

'We will ask female instructors to teach women this sport so they can benefit from this art.'

The 'thumbs up' from the community's senior figures mirrored the government's acceptance when they allowed for Marion's film to be screened at the Tehran Film Festival last year.

It had such a wide-reaching impact she's now involved in a bid to launch the country's first female surfing federation.

She said: 'Hopefully we can organise an international event in the future and convince more Iranians to come with us... but we don't know when it's going to happen because the administration is tricky.'

The sport's growing popularity has surprised Easkey, who 'never could have imagined' a religiously devout nation could adopt such a progressive sport into their hearts.

Big hit: Marion's film 'Into the Sea' (pictured) was screened at the Tehran Documentary Festival last year

Change: The film was received wonderfully by critics after being screened in a country where even televising female sports is forbidden 

She says during 'Into the Sea': 'I came here three years ago and there was nobody surfing and now look at it. More and more people are on the beach every day - boys, girls, everyone joining in.

'People say surfing is a selfish pursuit, it becomes kind of like an addiction and all you care about is finding the next perfect wave, but I really don't believe that anymore. 

'I think the most powerful thing about surfing is being able to share that passion and connecting people. This is unbelievable.'

Marion added: 'It was very exciting the last day, half the village came to watch the girls surf and the kids were very enthusiastic.

'A lot of them were very shy at first, but by the time we got into the water, that was gone. 

'It really breaks down the barriers when we go into the water, it's totally different from the beach. It makes people forget about the rules.'

Inspired by their own success, Easkey and Marion also set up the non-profit organisationWaves of Freedom.

In its own words, the charity 'uses surfing as a medium for empowerment, transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society, especially women and girls'.

Through their first project Surf Seeds, they are trying to establish surfing in Baluchistan through the donation of equipment, formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards.

The two women also created the 'We Surf in Iran' group within the local community in Baluchistan.

Now, Iranians travel from all over the country to get lessons in the region they were once afraid of.
