Julia Gillard has hit out at the sexism encountered by female leaders and revealed she has discussed the issue with other female heads of state, including Hilary Clinton.

'I have had the opportunity to talk to Hillary about [the challenges that women face] and I was grateful for it,' she said in a radio interview yesterday in Washington DC.

The comments come just after the release of Hillary Clinton's new book, Hard Choices, in which she singled out Ms Gillard, whom Ms Clinton says suffered 'outrageous sexism which shouldn't be tolerated in any country' during her time in office.

Ms Gillard is currently in the U.S. in her role as chair of the Global Partnership for Education.

While Ms Gillard acknowledged there were some female leaders, such as Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany and Christine La Garde, head of the IMF, it was important that women share their experiences because they were still greatly outnumbered in public positions.

'One of the things about being a leader in today's world as a woman is that there aren't many others… and I think because of that, when we do get the opportunity to say: "What's it like for you?", even across party lines… there are some common and shared experiences,' she told the Diane Rehm radio show.

Among the struggles often encountered by female leaders, said Ms Gillard, was the fact they are often judged on appearance, the struggle of often being the only woman in the room, and not being treated 'instinctively with the same sense of seriousness or the view that you will have the same gravitas as a male leader'.

She also said that there was a different approach to female and male leaders.

'I think for men, that conversation starts with: "What kind of leader will he be? Strong? Weak? Compassionate? Strident?" And for women it starts with: "Can she lead?" and it's a subtle but significant difference.'

'Yes we have talked about those things, Hillary and I, and I've had the opportunity to talk to some other leading women around the world about them.'

The former Prime Minister also addressed the famous 'misogyny speech' she delivered to parliament in October 2012, saying that her initial approach to sexism she encountered as the country's first female prime minister was to brush it off, but it got to a point she saw that she needed to shine a light on the issue.

'I think for me, the sense that after everything that I as the first woman prime minster had seen happen around me about gender and to me in that position, I was not going to stand there and get lectured about sexism.'

The former prime minster said female leaders suffer 'common and shared experiences' of sexism, such as being judged for their appearance and not being treated with the same respect as male leaders
