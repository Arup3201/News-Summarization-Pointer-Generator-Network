Eden Hazard may be supporting Arsenal's opponents for the rest of the season as the Gunners mount an improbable title bid, but for now the Chelsea winger is on Arsene Wenger's side.

Hazard says he is backing Arsenal to beat Monaco on Tuesday night, because them reaching the quarter finals would be good for English football.

The Gunners, who go to France attempting to overturn a daunting 3-1 deficit from the first leg, need to score at least three times to progress, after Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco's stoppage-time goal renewed Monaco's two-goal advantage.

But Hazard, a friend of the young Belgian forward, is backing the country of his employers rather than his compatriot in Tuesday night's clash.  

'I have a friend Ferreira-Carrasco over there [at Monaco] and I wish him the best,' Hazard told Canal Plus.

'But for English football, I hope Arsenal go through.'

England are currently second in UEFA's country coefficients, which determines how many clubs qualify for the Champions League, only narrowly ahead of Germany in third.
