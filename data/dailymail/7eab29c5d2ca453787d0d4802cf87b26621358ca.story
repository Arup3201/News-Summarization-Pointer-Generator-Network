Rupert Murdoch wined and dined three senior Tory Cabinet ministers and the Mayor of London during two nights in London.

It emerged today that Education Secretary Michael Gove met the media mogul for a private dinner, also attended by Foreign Secretary William Hague.

The night before Mr Murdoch had been joined by Boris Johnson, Chancellor George Osborne and Homeland star Damian Lewis.

Rupert Murdoch held two dinners with senior Conservatives last month, including with Education Secretary Michael Gove, it emerged today

The revelations will raise fresh questions about the relationship between senior Conservatives and the Murdoch media empire.

Publicly politicians have distanced themselves from media groups in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

The Leveson Inquiry into media ethics criticised how close politicians had got to senior media executives.

‘Over the last 30-35 years and  probably much longer, the political parties of UK national Government and of UK official Opposition, have had or developed too close a relationship with the press in a way which has not been in the public interest,’ the report said.

This included spending a ‘disproportionate amount of time, attention and resource on this relationship’ often at the expense of other more important issues.

It found that there was no specific ‘deal’ between David Cameron’s Conservative party and Rupert Murdoch News International empire.

But the Prime Minister is accused of undermining public confidence in politicians because there was a perception that he was too close to media executives.

On Tuesday January 22 Mr Johnson and Mr Osborne met Mr Murdoch for a private dinner at the newspaper tycoon's Mayfair home.

Old Etonian Lewis, who stars in the Homeland series made by Mr Murdoch's production company fox21, was also there.

Critics said Mr Johnson had to be more transparent about his meetings.

The following night the media mogul hosted another dinner, attended by Mr Gove, who used to be a columnist in The Times which is owned by Mr Murdoch’s News Corp.

A source close to Mr Gove said: ‘There was a separate dinner that Michael went to that William Hague was also at.’

The Leveson Inquiry recommended that senior politicians should publicly record all contact with media bosses, including through advisors.

Ministers and opposition frontbenchers should also publish a ’fair and reasonably complete’ outline details of letters, calls, texts and emails with press executives.
