Almost 100 years after they were sent, telegrams declaring the sinking of the Titanic have been put up for sale.

The eight messages were sent by Bruce Ismay, head of the ship’s  owners White Star Line, after he was rescued in the 1912 disaster.

The first telegram to the shipping company’s New York office was set at 1pm on April 15 – 11 hours after the Titanic sunk with the loss of 1,517 lives.

First word: Bruce Ismay's telegram, the first following the disaster, will go on sale in New York

In it, Mr Ismay wrote: ‘Deeply regret [to] advise you Titanic sank this morning fifteenth after collision [with] iceberg resulting serious loss [of] life. Further particulars later.’

The world's largest passenger liner of the age sank 400 miles south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland after it struck an iceberg on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.

Ismay wrote: 'Deeply regret [to] advise you Titanic sank this morning fifteenth after collision (with) iceberg resulting serious loss (of) life. Further particulars later.'

Bruce Ismay was dubbed 'Brute Ismay' by the press after claims that he deserted the Titanic while women and children were still on board

Soon after he wrote the telegrams Ismay - who was later dubbed the Coward of the Titanic - had to be treated with opiates to help him cope with the shock of the sinking.

Ismay was the managing director of White Star Line and he was depicted in the 1997 Kate Winslett movie Titanic encouraging the liner's captain to go faster.

He later told the official enquiry into the disaster that he had to turn and look away in the lifeboat at the moment the Titanic sunk at 2.20am on April 15.

The Carpathia arrived at the scene of the sinking in the north Atlantic at 4.10am and began picking up the 711 survivors.

Following the disaster Ismay was 
savaged by both the American and the British press for deserting the 
ship while women and children were still on board.

Some papers called him the 'Coward of the Titanic'.

In the hours that followed a radio operator in Philadelphia picked up signals broadcast by Carpathia that listed the nams of the survivors and this news of the disaster was then dispatched to the world's press.

It is thought Ismay's was the first official telegram that broke the news of the disaster.

The first message has Ismay's full name at the top and the rest bear the name 'Yamsi' - Ismay spelled backwards.

His second message stated: 'Most desirable Titanic crew aboard Carpathia should be returned home earliest moment possible / propose returning her myself please send outfit of clothes including shoes for me to Cedric [a ship]/ have nothing of my own.'

The telegrams are printed on paper headed 'The Marconi International Marine Communication Company Ltd' and were retained by the staff at the White Star Line's New York office.

Also included in the sale are replies sent by White Star Line officials in New York.

One reads: 'So thankful you are saved but grieving with you over terrible calamity...

'...accept my deepest sympathy horrible catastrophe.'

And: 'Concise marconigram account of actual accident greatly needed for enlightenment public and ourselves / this is most important.'

Marsha Malinowski, from auctioneers Sotheby's who are selling the telegrams, said: 'The owner thought with the 100th anniversary of the sinking coming up it was a good time to sell.

'They have been kept in an album and are in beautiful condition. They are actually quite chilling because they are very matter-of-fact.

'They had to be written as such because they were telegrams and they are pretty much a statement of facts.

'Ismay sent the first shortly after he was rescued by the Carpathia on April 15 and the others followed until the 18th.

'They discuss getting Titanic staff back home and also mention George Widener, a Philadelphia streetcar magnate who was lost in the sinking."

After he was rescued Ismay was led to the cabin belonging to the ship's doctor, which he reportedly did not leave for the entire journey to New York.

Miss Malinowski added: 'The disaster had a profound affect on Bruce Ismay who resigned from White Star Line and lived as a recluse in Ireland.'

Ismay died in 1937 aged 75.

The auction takes place in New York on December 13.
