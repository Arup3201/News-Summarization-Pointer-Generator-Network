Two days ago she was lifted up in the air in a gesture of triumph after her aunt won her first ever match at the Wimbledon Championships.

But slumped over the railings with her hand clasped over her mouth, five-year-old Lola Rose looked distraught last night as she watched Naomi Broady crash out in the second round.

Tennis fans had been championing for Miss Broady, 24, after it emerged she had funded her own career since being dropped by the Lawn Tennis Association over a risqué photograph when she was 17.

But last night the player was defeated after a hard-fought match against her doppelganger, Danish Caroline Wozniacki.

Afterwards, the humble player, who is 163rd in the world, said she apologised to her opponent, who is 16th, ‘for not giving her a very good match for her next round’.

Miss Broady has had no coach, physiotherapist or nutritionist since she was stripped of her funding by the LTA in 2007 when she posted a photograph of herself on a social networking site posing provocatively in front of a condom machine on a night out.

After her victory on Monday, she said it was ‘really satisfying’ to know she had done it on her own and only had herself to thank.

She also spoke about her young niece watching in the stands, whom she had hugged and kissed after her win, saying: ‘She just turned five.

‘We are very close  she let me give her kisses today.

‘Normally she wipes them off.  But I was allowed to give them today.’

Miss Broady and Miss Wozniacki, 23, looked near-identical on the court yesterday with matching long blonde plaits, white sun visors and gold necklaces.

The similar outfits caused confusion for some tennis fans, with one tweeting: ‘It really is a shame that Wozniacki and Broady look exactly the same in the wide shots.’

Both women smiled on court when fans screamed ‘I love you Naomi’, followed by ‘we love you too Caroline’, during a quiet moment in the match.

Wozniacki split from her fiancée Rory McIlroy last month just days after they had sent out their wedding invitations after the golfer got cold feet.

Miss Broady paid tribute to her opponent last night, saying: ‘She’s very sweet, such a nice girl inside and out.  She’s been through a rough time recently, and I’m super happy for her to go through the next round.  Even if she had to beat me.

‘Damn her.’

Naomi Broady last night claimed a last-minute change of court had effected her composure during the match she to Caroline Wozniacki.

She said: ‘It was a bit of a rush that we were moved on to Court One.

‘We weren’t sure if we had been moved to Centre or One, and then it was sort of, ‘Oh, you’re going to be on One literally now. ‘So I was only really half ready to get ready in five minutes to go on court.

‘I was a little bit uncomposed at the start of the match, if that’s a word.So there was lots of errors on court today.'

After months of preparation, there will no doubt be sore losers aplenty at Wimbledon.

And one French player is surely already in the running to be named the sorest of them all – although he would deny it.

Benoit Paire yesterday insisted he was happy after crashing out in the first round of the men’s singles because he ‘hates’ Wimbledon.

The world number 71 told a French newspaper: ‘I’m not at all sad to leave this place where the atmosphere displeases me greatly.

‘Simply I hate Wimbledon and I’m happy to leave as soon as possible.’

Paire has previously done well at the competition, reaching the third round on his last two visits.

He also reached the third round of the French Open last year, when he was ranked number 24, and the final of the Serbian Open in 2012.

Both tournaments are played on his favourite surface, clay.

But this season he has lost all three of his grass-court singles matches. And he was dealt another blow  yesterday when he was beaten in the men’s doubles with partner Tomasz Bednarek against Aleksandr Nedovyesov and Dmitry Tursunov.
