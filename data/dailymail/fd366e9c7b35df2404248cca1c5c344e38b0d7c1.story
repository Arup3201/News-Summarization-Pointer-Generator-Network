She was given just a 50 per cent chance of survival when she arrived into the world three months early.

But Rosie Lansbury has proved her strength by reaching the age of two - and thriving.

Her mother Tasha, 28, was told her daughter would 
probably not survive because a problem with the placenta had halted her 
development in the womb.

Rosie Lansbury was delivered by emergency C-section when her mother was just 28 weeks pregnant. She weighed just 1lb 4oz and was given a less than 50 per cent chance of survival

Rosie, two, has defied the odds to become a healthy toddler despite being born three months early

But despite being born by emergency 
C-section at just 28 weeks, Rosie survived and is now a thriving 
two-year-old who is meeting all developmental targets.

Miss Lansbury, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, said: ‘I keep a memory box of mementos from Rosie’s birth - things like photographs, and the tubes which kept her alive.

‘When I think of how close we came to losing her, I can’t help but cry. The staff at Barnet General Hospital were simply amazing - they brought her to life. 

‘Rosie’s my little fighter.’ Miss Lansbury, who works as a taxi controller, said she had no reason to suspect anything was wrong until Rosie stopped moving at 28 weeks. 

She said: ‘I woke up in the morning and I couldn’t feel her moving. It gives me goose bumps to think about it even now. I thought it would be best to go for a scan to make sure everything was ok.

‘They gave me an injection and waited an hour, but Rosie’s heart-rate started to drop. They said they would have to get her out.

Rosie was delivered prematurely because her mother, Tasha Lansbury, went to hospital when she stopped moving in the womb. Doctors soon discovered the baby's heart rate was dropping and she was in danger

‘Rosie didn’t cry when she was lifted 
out of me, and she was rushed off to incubation. I was on sedatives, but
 I remember thinking “where are they taking my baby?” It was an awful 
feeling.’

Rosie was born on September 12th 2011 weighing 1lb 4oz, even less than the midwives had been expecting.

It was later revealed that Rosie had stopped developing at 23 weeks because the placenta had failed to form properly.

Two and a half hours after the delivery, Miss Lansbury was finally able to see her daughter for the first time.

Rosie was in the neonatal ward, wrapped in a special plastic bag designed to help premature babies stay warm.

When she was born, Rosie was so small she was placed in a special plastic bag to help her stay warm

Miss Lansbury said: ‘It was shocking to 
see her like that. She looked just like a little raisin - her eyes were 
shut and her ears hadn’t formed properly. Her skin was almost 
see-through. She didn’t look like a baby at all.

‘I loved her the instant I saw her. But at the same time, she looked so vulnerable that I had to prepare myself for her fading away.’

Two days later, she was able to hold her tiny daughter for the first time.

She said: ‘I cried my eyes out. I was so relieved to be able to hold my baby. Up to then, I’d felt so helpless - as if she wasn’t my baby because I couldn’t do anything for her.

‘That was the first time I really felt that she was mine and I became fiercely protective over her.  

‘From that day I said to the nurses that I wanted to be involved more - I wanted to feed her, change her and look after her.’

Rosie is still slim and small for her age but doctors say she will catch up with other children by the age of five

When Rosie was two months old, doctors feared they would lose her because she developed an infection

There was a tense moment when, at two months old, Rosie fought off a serious chest infection.

Miss Lansbury said: ‘I was sure we were going to lose her. It was heart-breaking to think she had been through so much, only to succumb to an infection at two months.

‘She was put back onto a lot of the medication and treatment which she had been weaned from, so it felt like a big step back.’

But finally, after three months, Miss Lansbury was able to bring her daughter home to meet her big brother Alfie, now nine.

Today, Rosie is attending preschool just across the playground from where Alfie is attending primary school, and is meeting all developmental targets.

Miss Lansbury says until Rosie stopped moving she had no idea there was a problem with the pregnancy

Despite being born so early, Rosie is developing normally and is reaching all of her developmental targets

Miss Lansbury said: ‘Rosie was discharged from monitoring in December and they no longer need to keep a special eye on her.

‘She’s catching up height-wise but she’s still very skinny. The doctors say she won’t be fully caught up until she’s around five years old. Despite her age she’s still wearing clothes designed for 18-month-old children. 

‘But everyone’s extremely happy with the way she’s developed. Her motor skills are more advanced than most children her age. She’s running around and loves having conversations with other children at pre-school.

‘At home she’s become my little side-kick. The only person more protective over her than me is Alfie.

‘When I reflect on how close we came to losing her, I’m very grateful to everyone who helped us - the staff at Barnet General, and the volunteers with Bliss, who help families with premature children.

‘It was great to have such support when I needed it most.’
