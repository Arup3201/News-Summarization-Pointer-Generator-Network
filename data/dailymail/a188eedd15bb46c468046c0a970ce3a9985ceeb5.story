A little girl with an extremely rare medical condition that made protein poisonous to eat will enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner for the first time, thanks to a recent liver transplant.

Three-year-old Kennedy Stevenson, from Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, is one of only eight people to have been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder called S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency, which rendered her body unable to process protein, resulting in degenerative neurological effects.

Two weeks ago, Kennedy received a life-saving transplant from Michael Thompson, a high school classmate of Kennedy's mother, Donya McCoy.

Mr Thompson, who shares Kennedy's blood type, donated 25per cent of his liver after Mrs McCoy posted a desperate plea for a donor on Facebook. 

'She can now have turkey and stuffing,' Mrs McCoy told ABC News of Kennedy, who will remain at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh throughout the holidays, recovering from the 12-hour operation. 'It's just going to be really special that she can eat a Thanksgiving dinner.'

'She just ate a chicken finger for the first time ever,' the proud mother added, noting that Kennedy also got her first taste of chocolate milk, which she was particularly keen on.

Devastating diagnosis: Kennedy was born with a metabolic disorder called S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency, which rendered her body unable to process protein

'Her eyes got big and she just kept sucking the straw. She didn't want to stop,' she said.

Kennedy's previous diet had allowed no meat or dairy and just 20 grams of vegetable or fruit protein a day. 

Mrs McCoy discovered that Kennedy had the devastating disease when she had a seizure at eight months old, and a local doctor was baffled by the results of her MRI.

'He came out to talk to us and told us the white matter in her brain looked like nothing he’d ever seen before,' Mrs McCoy told the New York Daily News.

While other doctors were similarly stumped, Dr S. Harvey Mudd, an 86-year-old metabolic specialist, came out of retirement to treat Kennedy, and diagnosed her with the disorder.

After Dr Mudd died 11 months later, Dr Kevin Strauss, the medical director of the Clinic for Special Children, in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, took Kennedy on as a patient and determined that a liver transplant was the best option.

'So she’s the first in the world to have a liver transplant for her disease,' Mrs McCoy said.

Selfless: 'It’s just something that I want to do. I was put here on Earth to help people,' Mr Thompson (pictured with Kennedy) said

Mrs McCoy posted the request for a liver donor on Facebook in July, and Mr Thompson, 36, a firefighter from her hometown of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, responded - even though they weren't close friends at the time.

'It’s just something that I want to do,' Mr Thompson, who has a wife and two young children of his own, told LancasterOnline before the surgery. 'I was put here on Earth to help people.'

Mr Thompson was only hospitalized for a week, but was advised not to work for several months.

Kennedy will need to stay in the hospital for four months, where her father, Nick Stevenson, and stepfather, Josh McCoy, plan to visit her regularly.
