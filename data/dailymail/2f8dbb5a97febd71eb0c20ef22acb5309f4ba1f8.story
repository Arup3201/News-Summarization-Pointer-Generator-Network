It was the setting for many a wild party, even attracting the likes of President John F Kennedy, screen siren Marilyn Monroe and avant garde artist Andy Warhol.

Now the Manhattan penthouse once belonging to crooner Frank Sinatra can be yours - for a cool $7.7 million.

The sprawling 3,000 sq ft apartment - on New York's East 72nd street, is to go on sale - but these days it looks quite a bit different.

'The apartment has been modernised, but it is still 
set up for someone with that Rat Pack mentality,' Jason Haber, a broker for the property, which goes on the market this week, told The New York Post.

'It is really for someone who wants to entertain, to have people over, to have dinner parties.'

The
sprawling unit was once called the 'glittering grotto in the sky' by Andy 
Warhol and it was the setting for many a swinging soiree.

After
divorcing second wife Ava Gardner in 1957, Sinatra snapped up the 
duplex, which occupies the 22nd and 23rd floors, and the space was 
transformed into a four-bedroom, six-bathroom apartment worthy of the 
Rat Pack.

Ol' Blue Eyes helped to design the riverside pad and construction was completed in 1961. Sinatra called it home until 1972.

While arguably the ultimate bachelor pad, Sinatra met, married and then divorced Mia Farrow while living there.

The jewel in the penthouse's crown was a glassed-in, rooftop party room
where guests would mingle under 18-foot ceilings and enjoy sweeping 
views of the East River.

Another drawcard is the two wraparound terraces totaling 2,000 sq ft.

His star-studded guestlist often included fellow Rat Packers Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop.

It is even claimed that Davis used to enjoy throwing champagne glasses from the terrace onto the street.

One party included appearances from President John F Kennedy, Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe and avant garde artist Andy Warhol.

He also used the large party space to work on his vocals when he wasn't entertaining, Haber added.

The singer sold the apartment in 1972 to his personal physician, celebrity doctor Denton Cox, whose other clients included Judy Garland and Warhol.

When Cox died his estate was sold to insurance magnate Penny Hart in 2008 for $4.5 million.

Because Cox had done very little to maintain the penthouse, Hart made many renovations and turned a section of Sinatra's legendary party space into the master bedroom.
