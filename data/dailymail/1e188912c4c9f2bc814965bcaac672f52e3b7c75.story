If you think you don't push yourself when it comes to exercise, take a look at these gym-goers from a bygone era.

Dressed in full suit and tie, these gentleman are hardly breaking a sweat as they 'exercise' on equipment from the 1800s.

And rather getting their pulses racing by doing some serious time on the cross trainer, these 'athletes' don't appear to be doing very much of anything at all.

These pictures show a series of exercise machines from the 1800s - which hardly seem to work the user at all. Dressed in their best attire, these gentlemen appear to be sitting and standing around

This gentleman, wearing his full suit and tie, appears to be having a sit down, rather than doing any form of physical activity. It is thought the machine may have helped strengthen leg muscles

Another gentleman seems to be doing a Victorian version of yoga move the plank - but with the help of a suspended section of a bench

The vintage contraptions are believed to 
be early frontrunners of modern gym equipment such as the treadmill, 
exercise bike and bench press.

They
 were created by Swedish physician Gustav Zander  - who designed more 
than 70 keep-fit machines, detailed in his booklet Mechanical Exercise: A
 Means of Cure.

The images were published by Zander at his fitness institute in London’s Soho Square in 1883.

Another posture machine, which was one of 70 created by the doctor, was thought to help the user straighten the user's spine

The manual pictured men and women using the machines, which he described as 'a preventative against the evils engendered by a sedentary life and the seclusion of the office'.

The equipment was fitted with a complicated set of pulleys and counter balances designed to exercise muscles and fight the flab.

Later exercise equipment doesn't appear to be a great deal better.

By in the 19th Century, women were 
offered a magnetic corset as a cure for paralysis, indigestion and 
rheumatism – as well as helping them to keep wait.

But
 the 1920s brought with it the Molby Revolving Hammock, which promised 
to stretch a person’s muscles while straightening their spine.

It even claimed to calm a user’s anxiety as well as giving them a fuller bosom and hourglass shape.

The unusual-looking wooden machine looks much more trying than its counterparts - and would most likely work the exerciser's upper body and arm strength

The terrifying-looking Molby revolving hammock was released int he 1920s and promised to stretch a person's muscles while straightening their spine

A decade later, fitness freaks were using a horse-simulation machines, advertised as a hobbyhorse for adults with the ability to build muscles with its trotting movement.

It had been preceded by the Horse-Action Saddle from the Vigor shop in London’s Baker Street.

The store claimed the machine 'promotes good spirits', 'quickens the circulation', 'stimulates the liver', 'creates appetite' and 'cures indigestion and gout'.

Some pieces of equipment, however, look more like torture devices

Later machines also had questionable benefits such as a revolving hammock
