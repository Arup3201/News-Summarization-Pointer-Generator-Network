Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar thinks Steven Gerrard's head is already in Los Angeles after he received his marching orders against Manchester United on Sunday.

The Liverpool captain will leave Anfield in the summer to play for LA Galaxy in the USA, and got sent off in his final clash with Manchester United after just 38 seconds of being on the pitch.

Gerrard came steaming into a challenge with Juan Mata initally, before an off-the-ball stamp on Ander Herrera resulted in a straight red card from referee Martin Atkinson.

Former Reds keeper Grobbelaar believes Gerrard wasn't fully focused on the match and is already looking ahead to the next step of his career. 

'Steven Gerrard wanted to stamp his authority on to the match,' Grobbelaar told talkSPORT. 'I know that Gerrard’s heart is in Liverpool, and always will be, but his head unfortunately is in Los Angeles.

'He said himself that he takes full responsibility for what his actions were. A lot of other referees would have just given a yellow and warned him to stamp it out because there were some other hefty challenges and some tackles that could've gone either way.'
