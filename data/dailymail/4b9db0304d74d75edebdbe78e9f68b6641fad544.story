A violent mugger jailed for attacking pensioners with a knife has escaped from an open prison – becoming the second dangerous inmate to go on the run from the jail in less than six months.

A police search was under way last night for Sabul Miah who was sentenced to two life sentences in 2003 for a serious of stabbing attacks and violent robberies.

He has been missing for at least three days after failing to return to Standford Hill, a category-D prison in Sheerness, Kent. Miah was let out on day release on Thursday.

Missing: Violent criminal Sabul Miah was serving two life sentences when he escaped from the open prison

It is another embarrassment for prison chiefs after armed robber Michael Wheatley – known as the ‘Skull Cracker’ – absconded while on day release in May.

Wheatley, 55, was recaptured days later after robbing the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey at gunpoint. He had robbed the same building society 13 years earlier.

Last night, MP Philip Davies, who campaigns against open prisons, criticised the Ministry of Justice for placing dangerous criminals like Miah and Wheatley in one.

He said: ‘Dangerous criminals should not be placed in open prisons where they could easily escape.

‘You would have thought that the Ministry of Justice would have learned the lessons from the Wheatley experience. They should have tightened the system up straight away at Standford. I will raise this matter with the Secretary of State.’

Miah, 40, from Poplar, East London, was convicted of robbing at least 15 pensioners in what a judge described as ‘persistent and cruel crimes against the elderly’. His violence included slashing a war veteran’s throat and stabbing an 82-year-old woman’s hand.

He would target his victims after watching them withdraw their money from post offices in the Tower Hamlets area, follow them home and rob them at knifepoint outside their houses or in the lifts of their buildings. Miah had a crack and heroin habit.

At his trial, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin told Southwark Crown Court: ‘These were heart-rending offences committed against some of the most vulnerable people in the community without the least sign of mercy. The court will do everything to protect people against such terrible crime.’

Miah was given two life sentences with the condition that he would only qualify for parole after eight years. It is believed that parole was delayed due to ‘bad behaviour’ in prison.

Last night the Ministry of Justice confirmed that Miah was reported missing on Thursday after failing to appear for afternoon roll-call. Kent Police were notified immediately.

His final victim was George Rowe, 79, a Second World War veteran. Miah slashed his throat in a lift.

Mr Rowe’s daughter, Pat McFarlane, a teacher, said that her father had left his council-owned flat in Limehouse, East London, to pick up his and his wife’s weekly pension from the local post office on December 30, 2002.

Mrs McFarlane, 53, from Stratford, East London, said that Miah followed Mr Rowe to his building.

‘My dad was about to get into the lift as he lived on the fourth floor, when Miah shouted to keep the door open. My dad, being the gentleman, kept the lift door open as it was raining. Once inside, Miah demanded the money.

Miah robbed Mr Rowe of £123 – the weekly pension – and tried to run off. When Mr Rowe tried to snatch the money back, Miah slashed his throat and pushed him back into the lift.

Mrs McFarlane said: ‘My dad staggered out of the lift with blood pouring out of him.

‘Neighbours saw him and called an ambulance. They saved his life. My dad was never the same. He left hospital after two weeks, but could not return home as he was so scared.’

Subsequently, doctors discovered that Mr Rowe had lung cancer, and he died in April, 2003. Mrs McFarlane believes the trauma of the robbery worsened his health condition.

She said: ‘That man has robbed us of my dad. He would have lived much longer. Miah destroyed our family.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have made major changes to tighten up temporary release processes and open prison eligibility. Absconds have reached record lows.’

He declined to comment on how two prisoners managed to escape from the same prison in five months.

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, which campaigns for tougher sentences for criminals, said: ‘Open prisons are undermining proper punishments and putting the public at very real risk.’

Latest figures from the Ministry of Justice show that in the financial year 2013/14, 225 inmates escaped from open prisons, or within the ‘open element’ of category B or C jails.
