A former PR firm employee claims he suffered relentless sexual harassment at the hands of two female co-workers and that his boss refused to intervene.

Despite being told he was doing a good job, Joseph Jackson was fired this month from his $35,000-a-year position at Open Communications PR firm in New York.

Jackson believes he was terminated because he formally complained about the harassment, so now he's suing the company, its CEO and the two aggressors.

In a lawsuit filed Monday in New York, Jackson detailed the inappropriate and unwanted comments, texts and physical contact he received from fellow employees Katie Campisano and Sally O'Dowd.

Advances in the workplace: Joseph Jackson claims he was sexually harassed by two women he worked with at Open Communications, a New York PR firm he was fired from this month

Aggresors: In the lawsuit filed in New York court on Monday, Jackson alleges that both Katie Campisano (left) and Sally O'Dowd (right) made inappropriate comments to him

In his position as Account Coordinator, Jackson worked with Campisano and O'Dowd to pitch clients and write press releases.

O'Dowd, one of the co-founders of the company, was Jackson's superior but started flirting with him when he attended her birthday party along with other co-workers in August, the lawsuit says. 

At the end of the party, O'Dowd came up to him and allegedly hugged him three times.

While hugging him, Jackson says O'Dowd whispered in his ear, 'You are so handsome,' 'You are so awesome,' and 'You are so talented' before kissing him on the back of the neck.

Touching: The harassment from O'Dowd started at her birthday party in August when she came up to Jackson and hugged him three times and even kissed him on the neck

He says he didn't hug O'Dowd back and immediately left the restaurant 'distraught'.

In the following months, that harassment entered the office with Jackson claiming O'Dowd forcibly touched his abs, massaged his arms, kissed his neck and constantly told him how 'sexy' he was. 

'I've been doing these exercises and crunches. My body is so fit and tight. Poke my abdomen,' she allegedly told him on December 18, and then forcibly brought his hand to her stomach when he refused.

Confident: On one occasion, Jackson says O'Dowd forced him to touch her ads because her body was 'so fit and tight' from her exercising

She would also talk about her dates and sexual encounters with him, and said several times how much she loved young black and Hispanic men.

In one instance detailed in the suit, O'Dowd told Jackson by the water cooler: 'You remind me of my hot young Puerto Rican lover Apollo'.

And Jackson says O'Dowd wasn't the only one giving him unwanted attention.

He's also claiming harassment by co-worker Katie Campisano and in the lawsuit says she sent him a text message in November asking: 'When are we going to have our bang sesh?'

Other inappropriate texts exposed in the suit include 'I'm going to need you to be my next boyfriend Joseph' and you 'may be easier to bang when we're not coworkers'.

Sexting: In the suit Jackson says Campisano sent him inappropriate texts, including one asking: 'When are we going to have our bang sesh?'

In November, when they got a new condom client, Campisano tested the product on a banana and remarked that it was 'tight around the base'.

'It probably wouldn't fit Joseph,' she allegedly said.

All the while, Jackson says he complained about the harassment, making it known how uncomfortable he was.

He says he first formally complained in October to company CEO John Andrew Morris who said he was sorry and would 'look into it'.

But Jackson says Morris ignored the complaint and wouldn't even intervene when he witnessed some of the harassment.

In December, O'Dowd was in a room with both Morris and Jackson and made the comment: 'I get to stand next to Joseph and his sexy biceps'.

Instead of calling her out, Morris simply shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes.

Out of left field: After formally complaining about the harassment on three occasions, Jackson was fired on February 21 right after being told he was doing a good job and given more responsibilities

Jackson complained about the harassment two more times in the subsequent months, but Morris still refused to do anything, he says.

Moving up: Campisano received a promotion and a raise, despite Jackson bringing up the sexual harassment complaints

He even claims he was victimized after making the complaints, getting an increased workload and more and more negative feedback.

When he informed the CEO about the additional harassment from Campisano, Morris allegedly laughed and brushed them off. Campisano was even promoted and given a raise following the complaints.

In November, around the time of Jackson's second complaint, Morris called him 'a hater that needed to be removed' in front of other employees.

'I don't understand what the problem is. You're doing good here,' Morris allegedly told Jackson when he continued to complain. 

Which
 is why his firing on February 21 came as a surprise. In addition to 
Morris telling him he was doing a good job, Jackson was also given the 
responsibility to lead social media events right before his sacking. 

Jackson
 is now suing for lost wages, benefits, emotional distress and punitive 
damages and stands to get as much as seven figures if he wins.

Peter Gallagher, a lawyer representing the company and its employees in the lawsuit told Mailonline they are 'very confident though the court process that the truth is going to come out and our clients are going to be exonerated.'

MailOnline
 reached out to
 Jackson who refused to comment on the lawsuit further.
