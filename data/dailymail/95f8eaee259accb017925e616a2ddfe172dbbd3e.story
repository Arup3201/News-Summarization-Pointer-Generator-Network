Victims: Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus have agreed to write a book about their terrible ordeal

The other victims, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, are collaborating with a Pulitzer Prize-winning team of Washington Post
reporters for a planned book about their ordeal. 

Michelle
was abducted on August 23, 2002 when she was 21 years old, a year 
before Amanda Berry in April 2003. A year later Gina deJesus joined 
them.

Berry and DeJesus said they will work with the Post's Mary Jordan, a
Cleveland native, and her husband and fellow reporter, Kevin Sullivan.

No meetings with publishers have been scheduled, although interest would
likely be based on the popularity of another kidnapping survivor's 
memoir, Jaycee Dugard's A Stolen Life.

Castro had been sentenced to life in prison, plus 1,000 years, but was found dead in his jail cell in September.

'Many
have told, and continue to tell, this story in ways that are both 
inaccurate and beyond the control of these young women,' said James 
Wooley, the attorney for Berry and DeJesus.

'Our clients have a strong 
desire for privacy, but it is a reality that confronts them every day. 
Gina, Amanda and their families have decided to take control and are now
interested in telling the story of what happened to them.'

Wooley
said in his statement that he had known Jordan for years and contacted 
her about the project.

Jordan said during a recent interview that
she was drawn to the 'resilience' of Berry and DeJesus and was eager to
help them tell an 'amazing story of overcoming adversity'.

In 2003, she
and Sullivan won a Pulitzer for their series about the Mexican criminal
justice system.

Investigators said the three victims were bound, repeatedly raped and deprived 
of food and bathroom facilities.

At
his sentencing, Knight told Castro: 'I spent 11 years in hell, now your
hell is just beginning'. She was the only one of the three girls to 
attend.
