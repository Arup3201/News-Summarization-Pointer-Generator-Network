A former Eton College classics teacher caught with child pornography killed himself a decade later after he struggled to deal with the shame of his conviction, an inquest heard.

More than 200 images of boys were discovered on Ian McAuslan's computer when he handed it to IT staff at the prestigious Berkshire school for a routine upgrade.

The 68-year-old, who subsequently resigned from the school, admitted possessing and making indecent images of children in 2004 and was spared jail.

Conviction: Former Eton classics teacher Ian McAuslan killed himself a decade after he admitted child pornography charges

However, an inquest heard today that he never recovered from his conviction and on March 16 of this year was found dead in the kitchen of his flat in Southampton, Hampshire.

After the pictures were found on his computer police had raided his home and recovered a 20-year-old video which contained indecent images of children.

He admitted two counts of possessing 
indecent images of children and 14 of making them when he appeared at 
Bracknell Magistrates’ Court in April 2004.

When he was later sentenced at Reading Crown Court he was given nine months’ 
imprisonment, suspended for two years, and placed on the Sex Offenders’ 
Register for seven years.

Judge Christopher Critchlow told him: 'You have a fine record as a 
teacher and were clearly devoted to your profession.

'I give you the full credit for that long service and all that you have done in that career.

'It’s a tragedy for you and all who know you that your career should end this way.'

Today an inquest in Southampton was told one of McAuslan's neighbours believed the 2004 conviction was linked to his death.

Police were called to McAuslan's home after concerns were raised over his welfare.

Officers visited the flat twice, but received no response and prior to the third occasion spoke to a neighbour who gave them a key and told them he had seen McAuslan two days before.

Detective Constable Neil Smith told the inquest that officers let themselves into the one bedroom property and found McAuslan's body in the kitchen with a bag over his head.

Officers told the neighbour about the suspected suicide, and he is said to have replied: 'I thought that was the case.'

DC Smith added: 'The neighbour said he was aware of Mr McAuslan’s conviction in 2004 and believed this was linked to his death.'

The inquest was told that McAuslan had left a copy of his will on the table, alongside a number of personal letters, which he had written and signed.

Officers also found a bottle of tablets in the lounge, which was almost empty, and there was a glass containing the 'remnants' of red wine.

His sitting room contained thousands of books, drawers full of classical music, an 'expensive' HiFi, and a 3D Panasonic television on the wall.

There was also a piano, and a number of computers.

DC Smith added: 'Mr McAuslan was an only child and his parents had died some years ago. He had no next of kin.

'He was a lecturer at Eton College, where his chosen subject was Classics.

'He was very methodical, verging on obsessive compulsive disorder. Everything had it’s own place.'

McAuslan was identified using the photograph on his driving licence, which was found in a bag.

The inquest heard there was no evidence of a struggle, or forced entry, and the post mortem found no sign of natural disease.

Consultant histopathologist Norman Carr, who conducted the post mortem examination, said there was a 'potentially fatal' level of a drug found in his blood, which could have reduced his breathing.

Deputy coroner Gordon Denson said: 'I can only conclude from the content of the letters Mr McAuslan left that he had the intention before his death to take the actions he did.'

He recorded a verdict of suicide, with the primary cause of death being asphyxia and the secondary cause toxicity.
