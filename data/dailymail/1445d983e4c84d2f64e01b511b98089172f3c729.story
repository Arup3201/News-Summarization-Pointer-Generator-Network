CNN anchor Dana Bash has revealed that she too has been the target of inappropriate comments about her weight made by male senators.

Speaking to fellow CNN news anchor Brooke Baldwin, Ms Bash, 43, said she wasn't surprised 'in the least' to learn of New York senator Kristen Gillibrand's recent admission that she had been called 'porky' and 'fat' by male colleagues.

'After I had my son three years ago, I got some comments that would blow you away from male senators,' the political correspondent, based in Washington D.C. said. 'Talking about getting my figure back and things like that.'

Although the mother-of-one declined to outline any further specifics, she remarked that these men maybe 'didn't realize' they were being inappropriate, and largely blames their age for the comments.

'[Ms Gillibrand] mentions very clearly that these are law-makers in their sixties, seventies and eighties, and it is very much generational,' she agreed.

'I can't even think of one law-maker in either party, either chamber, who would do this who is maybe 50 years old or younger.'

Ms Bash - who was recently honored by ELLE magazine as part of its annual Women in Washington Power List - mentioned that she had spoken 'in private' both to Ms Gillibrand and to other female members of congress about such matters.

Ms Bash is currently CNN's chief congressional correspondent. She split with fellow CNN anchor John King in 2012, after less than four years of marriage and is now a single mother.  

Her comments come just days after Ms Gillibrand spoke openly of the sexism she has faced at various points in her political career. 

In her new book Off the Sidelines, the 47-year-old - who has two young sons with her husband Jonathan - recalls how a male colleague once said to her at the gym: 'Good thing you're working out, because you wouldn't want to get porky!'

On a separate occasion, a Southern congressman was walking her down the aisle in the House chamber when he said to her: 'You know, Kirsten, you're even pretty when you're fat.'

Like Ms Bash, Ms Gillibrand acknowledged that the comments were derogatory, but probably not meant in earnest. 

'I believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot,' she said. 

The senator, who says she has fluctuated between size four and size 20 throughout her career, admits that regardless of other people's opinions, appearance is something that she does have to pay attention to. 

'I've learned that how I look and feel is important, for reasons beyond health and vanity,' she writes.

'If I look and feel good, I'm more positive and confident and people are more likely to listen to me. If more people are listening, I have more power to fight effectively for what I believe in.'
