Mushrooms grown in Siberia could be used to create a new treatment for AIDS, Russian scientists claim.

The researchers say that Chaga mushrooms growing on birch trees are a ‘promising’ subject for further research.

Scientists at the Vector Institute, near Novosibirsk, say that they have three different mushrooms all of which could be used in antiretroviral medicines but that the Chaga mushroom is showing the most promise.

'Strains of these mushrooms demonstrated low toxicity and a strong antiviral effect,' a statement from the Institute said.

They could be effective against influenza, smallpox and HIV, The Siberian Times reports.

The mushrooms are thought to contain betulinic acid which has antiretroviral and anti-inflammatory properties.

The mushrooms have been used by traditional healers in Siberia for centuries.

Some people believe they also have cancer-combating properties.

Chaga mushrooms are referenced as a treatment for cancer in Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s Cancer Ward which was published in 1967.

However, experts at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York said that no clinical trials have been carried out to establish whether Chaga is a safe or effective method of disease prevention.

The Vector Institute - also known as the State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR - is one of just two official repositories for the now-eradicated smallpox virus.

In Soviet times, it was a centre for biological warfare research.

If that's true, Big Pharma won't be very happy, therefore it won't be true.

I've taken chaga for years.  It known to improve the health of your cells in a similar way antioxidants improve health of your immune system.  Russians have been using it to prevent/treat cancer with high recovery rates for centuries.

Of the "EXPERTS" are going to say "no clinic tests have proven anything".  They would HATE to have a natural cure found.  They'd lose too much money selling the drugs they create that do nothing whatsoever....unless you count how they can make you sicker.
