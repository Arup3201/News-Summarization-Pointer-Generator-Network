As the iconic landmark of the London Olympics, the Aquatics Centre played host to some of the most memorable moments of the Games.

But little over two months since the last swimmer took to the water during the Paralympics, Zaha Hahid’s striking white building appears to be in a state of decay and a shadow of its former glory.

New photographs of the Olympic Park show paint peeling from the sides of the £269 million venue and what appears to be damp stains on the roof.

Paint is flaking off the £269 million Aquatic Centre just two months after London 2012 finished and control of the Olympic Park was transferred from LOCOG to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC)

Rubbish and junk is strewn around the front of the arena.

The building’s rapid decline comes just weeks after control of the Olympic Park was transferred from LOCOG to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC).

Photographs also show the fast pace of change at the park since closing its doors to the public - with workmen setting about dismantling and adapting venues before it reopens in 2014.

The temporary McDonald’s restaurant 
in the park - for six weeks the biggest in the world holding 1,500 
people - has all but gone, with just part of the building’s shell 
remaining.

Bright yellow skips are dotted around the park, and most of the hospitality and broadcasting areas have been taken down.

The eye-catching bubblegum pink signage that helped direct visitors around the park has also vanished.

The Aquatics Centre is being modified, 
with the two temporary white grandstands at its side being removed to 
transform the venue from 17,000 seat area to a more modest community 
pool seating 2,500 people.

The LLDC, headed by Mayor of London Boris Johnson, has found tenants for seven of the eight permanent venues at the park, which is to be renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

It has promised to create a world class sporting legacy for top athletes and the new communities who will move into housing on and around the former athletes village.
