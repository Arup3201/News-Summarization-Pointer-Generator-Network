Two young members of a Boston gang have been convicted of murdering a 16-year-old boy in 2011, simply because his friend lived on a street they deemed enemy territory.

Sheldon Mattis and Nyasani Watt, both 20, were found guilty of first-degree murder in Suffolk County on Friday. The verdict gave victim Jaivon Blake's mother Diane Simmons some closure after two years of torment.

'I can relax,' the mother said. 'I'm so happy, just really happy... I'm just glad that justice has been served and that my son and I can be at peace and rest.'

Blake, a middle school student at the Martin Luther King School in Dorchester, was an innocent casualty of a gang feud in the Bowdoin-Geneva neighborhood of Dorchester on September 25, 2011.

Prosecutors said Mattis and Watt were part of a gang hell bent on killing rivals and a number of targets, including Blake and his 14-year-old friend, had been picked out based on geography to send a message.

The pair selected the young boys after Blake's friend told Mattis he lived on Everton Street during a casual conversation outside a Walgreens pharmacy.

Mattis patted Watt on the back as he rode off on his bike to find the boys, with his hidden .49-caliber pistol.

When he found them, Watt fired six rounds, striking the 14-year-old in the neck and shoulder and Blake in the spinal cord. The friend managed to run away but Blake dropped to the ground partially paralyzed and gasping for air.

His brother rushed to the grisly scene and watched helplessly as paramedics tried to save the 16-year-old's life but failed. He died two hours later at Boston Medical Center.

'People of conscience should be angry about this case,' Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said following the verdict, the Boston Globe reported. 'They should be angry that two boys, just 14 and 16, would be gunned down on the streets of their own city without provocation. There's no gang or allegiance or code of conduct that can excuse this act or even make sense of it.'

Relief: Blake's mother, Diane Simmons, pictured on November 12, said she left happy after Friday's conviction

As Simmons hugged her brother and friends following the guilty verdict, Mattis shook his head and mouthed 'I love you,' to his parents who sat in the courtroom. He was led away in handcuffs.#

Meanwhile, Watt's mother cried softly outside the courtroom.

The pair are due to be sentenced on December 2. First-degree murder carried an automatic life sentence in Massachusetts, however Watt may get a separate sentencing hearing given he was 17 at the time of the shooting and such sentences are forbidden for juveniles after a Supreme Court decision last year.

Mattis' friends and family insist he's innocent and that the case was riddled with inconsistencies.

'We're losing a son, too,' said Mattis's mother, Denise, 41, told the Boston Globe.

His girlfriend, Ebony Williams, 19, ran out of the courtroom in tears after the guilty verdict. 'This makes no sense,' she later told the Globe. 'How are you convicted for something you didn't do?'
