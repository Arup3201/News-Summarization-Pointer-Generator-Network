Los Angeles law enforcement officials have revealed that the drug found 'in plain sight' at Justin Bieber's mansion in a Tuesday morning raid was molly, a form of ecstasy, and not cocaine as originally believed.

The drug was found along with the prescription sedative Xanax as police executed a felony warrant to search the sprawling Calabasas property.

The warrant was related to allegations that the singer had been responsible for throwing eggs at a neighbor's home in an exclusive gated community in Calabasas, California, last Thursday - causing more than $20,000 worth of damage.

The singer's good friend, rapper Lil 
Za, was arrested after officers found the drugs during the raid on the 
19-year-old singer's home.

Twice in one day: Bieber's close friend Lil Za was arrested on charges of cocaine possession at the singer's home during Tuesday morning's raid - he was later arrested and charged with vandalism inside jail just moments before he was due to be released

TMZ reports that what police originally believed to be cocaine was actually the drug molly, or MDMA.

'You have to analyze any evidence to see what comes forward," spokesman Steve Whitmore said. "It may not be that particular narcotic,' said LA County Sheriff Steve Whitmore.

'Let’s just wait and see, but we’re fairly certain it’s a controlled substance,' Whitmore said according to the LA Times.

For Lil Za, the difference is about two years in the slammer.

Lesser crime: Sheriffs haul away Lil Za. If the drug that was allegedly in his possession was MDMA and not cocaine as was originally believed he faces a far lesser jail sentence if convicted

Whereas the cocaine could have landed him in prison for three years, the molly possession could mean closer to one year for him.

Officials says Bieber was 'not connected' to the drugs.

led away by several officers before being driven to the police station 
in the back of a cop car.  

Justin Bieber's good friend, rapper Lil Za, was hauled away from the 19-year-old singer's Calabasas mansion Tuesday after finding what they originally believed to be cocaine.

TMZ later reported that police now think the substance in question is molly, an often powdered form of MDMA similar to ecstasy.

It was also revealed late Tuesday that, 
in addition to molly, police say they found the powerful prescription 
tranquilizer Xanax.

The difference between cocaine and molly, besides their effects, is the punishment for possessing them.

While Lil Za may have face around three years for cocaine possession, he'll face a sentence closer to one year if convicted of possessing molly.

Lil Za, real name Xavier Smith, has been widely regarded as a 'bad influence' on Bieber for over a year. He was supposed to have been moved out of the singer's home but according to reports he has been 'staying at 
Bieber's Calabasas home for months.'

Eleven L.A. County Sheriff's patrol cars were spotted entering Bieber's gated community to look for 'video surveillance or other relevant evidence' to link him to the incident.

Eight people, including the singer, were detained in the property’s garage as deputies executed the warrant.

In
 a press conference following the raid, an L.A. Sheriff's Department 
official said the singer 'had not been arrested nor exonerated' in the 
egging case.

It is estimated that a dozen deputies, who brought a battering ram, carried out the search looking for any evidence to
might link the singer with the egg assault. 

Bieber
 was not questioned at the scene regarding anything except standard 
search-warrant inquiries and would likely handle any questioning through
 his attorney later, said Whitmore.

Police later issued a press release about the raid on Bieber's home.

It said: 'Search Warrant Served at Calabasas Home after Estimated $20,000 Vandalism on January 9.

'At
 about 8am on Tues, Jan. 14, 2014, detectives from Lost Hills/Malibu 
Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department began 
service of a search warrant at the Calabasas home of Suspect Justin 
Bieber.

'The purpose of
 the search warrant is to seek video surveillance or other possible 
evidence in the vandalism that occurred on January 9, 2014. The 
vandalism damage is estimated by the homeowner to be approximately 
$20,000.00. The investigation is ongoing.'

Thompson declined to describe what 
evidence detectives took from Bieber's home, but said the emphasis 
wasn't on what was in the pop star's refrigerator.

He said the house 
Bieber allegedly egged had custom wood and other expensive features and 
that several thousands of dollars in damage occurred. Thompson added 
that a judge authorized the search warrant.

'I get that the eggs 
don't seem that significant, but it does rise to the level of a felony,'
 Thompson said.

'But a felony crime is a felony crime, no matter how you commit it,' he said, 'and this crime rose to the felony section, and a judge signed a search warrant saying we should go get evidence related to the felony crime.'

'There is a victim in this case who has extensive damage
 done to their home. And that's a serious incident.'

A source told RadarOnline.com that Justin was 'furious' at the raid.

Eleven cop cars were involved in the raid on Justin Bieber's mansion in an exclusive gate community in Calabasas, California

'He is obviously upset that cops basically had free reign and are going through his personal belongings in his house,' the source said.

'Justin has been kept out of the house while the search warrant is being executed and is being watched over by several sheriff’s deputies.'

According to reports on Twitter, the police may even have had their guns drawn when they entered the Bieber residence.

Maejor Ali, a music producer who has worked with singer, tweeted 'Thousands of tax payers dollars were just wasted by sending 12 armed officers with guns drawn in Justin Bieber's home to search for eggs.'

It isn't known if Ali was in the house at the time and his tweet was retweeted by Kylie Jenner, amongst others.

It is common practice to temporarily detain people while a search warrant is being served.

In
 California, if the damage is greater than $400 it becomes felony 
vandalism. Whitmore said the egging incident was determined to be a 
felony because several thousands of dollars-worth of damage occurred. 

The incident marks just the latest clash 
between the pop star and his neighbors, who have accused him of throwing
 loud parties and speeding through the neighborhood.

The
 search comes in the wake of last Thursday's incident, when a neighbor 
called police claiming that the pop star had pelted his home with eggs.

The neighbor shot a video during the alleged attack - which was posted on TMZ - and in the clip could be heard arguing and screaming at the egg-thrower.

was covered in smashed eggs and police were called after the pop star is 
alleged to have launched an egg-throwing attack

During the video the neighbor can be 
heard shouting: 'I can f***ing see you!' as the footage shows the damage
 that was allegedly done by the star.

At another stage there was a verbal altercation between the pair with the neighbor shouting: 'What the hell are you doing?'

Then another voice, apparently Justin's, shouts back: 'F**k you! I got another one for you, actually.'

Justin allegedly hasn't called the neighbor to apologize or offered to foot the bill.

Repairs to the property are estimated to cost thousands of dollars because the pricey Venetian plaster on the outside has to be redone.

The entire front of the house needs to be re-plastered which will cost around $15,000, while an additional $5,000 is needed to repair the entryway, including re-staining the doors.

Crack: Around 20 eggs were apparently thrown in the alleged attack

The neighbor 'heard something 
banging against his house in Calabasas around 7:30pm on Thursday, and when
 he stepped on to a second floor balcony... he says he saw Justin down 
below hurling eggs at his front door,' reports TMZ.

The neighbor's 13-year-old daughter then called the police upon instruction from her father.

Bieber has had a number of run-ins with his neighbors.

In March last year he was said to have spat in a neighbor's face after he was confronted over speeding in his Ferrari.

The
 Los Angeles Sheriff's Department were said to be investigating the 
incident, during which Justin was alleged to have said: 'I'm going to 
f**king kill you.'

In November, police attended his home three times in one night when he held a major party.

According
 to TMZ, the noise got out of control and neighbors called the police 
at 1am, the LA County Sheriff's deputies then allegedly paid Bieber a 
call and told him to keep the noise down.

In December, the singer announced he was retiring to spend some time 'figuring out myself as a man.'
