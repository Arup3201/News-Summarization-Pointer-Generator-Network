In the period drama Downton Abbey, servants are portrayed as loyal, deferential and discreet.

But experts claim that finding a modern-day butler with such traits can be a tall order.

Estate agent Knight Frank claims that after debt, death and divorce, staffing problems are one of the main reasons behind the sale of country homes.

While some aspire to own a sprawling estate complete with a gardener, housekeeper, nanny and butler, the dream can turn into a nightmare, it is claimed.

Finding good staff like Carson in Downton Abbey, played by Jim Carter (right), is becoming a burden for  upper class country home onwers, with good workers 'like gold dust', estate agents Knight Frank has said

In its latest ‘rural report’, Knight Frank said that many customers simply cannot find the staff.

This upper-class problem may attract little sympathy, but experts claim that employing workers for a country house ‘can be a burden without expert help or advice’.

The report said issues around recruitment and retention were common problems, while some employees are litigious and ready to sue their boss if they feel their rights are breached.

It said: ‘Staffing issues – especially if they ever reach the court – can be extremely costly, in terms as time and personal angst, as well as money.

‘It is vital to keep abreast of any new rules to avoid being sued by disgruntled employees.

‘People are becoming increasingly well-informed about their rights and litigious, especially if they have a high-profile employer.’

Social media has also caused a fresh headache for employers, who could find their secrets splashed across Facebook or Twitter by disgruntled or indiscreet workers.

Knight Frank said anyone hiring staff should ensure they sign confidentiality agreements which includes social media, saying: ‘Domestic staff in particular may have access to very personal aspects of your life, things that you probably don’t want shared with the entire world.’

Knight Frank said staff should sign confidentiality agreements to protect the personal lives of their employers from being exposed, as happened in the trial of the aides to Nigella Lawson and ex-husband Charles Saatchi

Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband and art dealer Charles Saatchi found their own personal lives exposed after a much-publicised court case involving their assistants Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo.

The Grillo sisters were found not guilty in December 2013 of defrauding the former couple of hundreds of thousands of pounds while working for them at their Belgravia townhouse.

But during the trial, details of Saatchi and Lawson’s rocky marriage and lifestyles emerged.

Francesca Grillo claimed she typically started cleaning at 6am and would often still be getting texts about work from the art dealer at just before midnight.

She also said Miss Lawson seemed 'unhappy' in the marriage and claimed her unsociable husband blocked her attempts to break into the US market. Yesterday, Knight Frank said a rise in overseas millionaires buying property in the UK meant the demand for good private staff now outweighed supply – enabling the top workers to name their price.

Carson is a much-loved butler in Downton Abbey, but finding staff like him is proving to be difficult 

Angus Harley, who heads Knight Frank’s consultancy service finding staff for the super-wealthy, said: ‘Owning a country house can very quickly become unenjoyable if the people they have hired are not looking after it as they would like.

‘Good workers are like gold dust and they do not tend to move around often.’

He said that many wealthy people tried to hire couples so that one could do the housekeeping and cooking while the other did outdoor work such gardening, driving and security.

However, such arrangements also came with drawbacks, he said, should the couple split up.

Mr Harley also urged people to carry out full checks to ensure applicants had no debts, driving infringements or criminal records, claiming he had come across ‘in-post butlers who have done time for burglary’.

All is not lost for those who find themselves forced to sell their country home after failing to find the right staff though.

Knight Frank said those who found themselves unable to suitable workers for their rural abode simply bought ‘a chalet in the Alps’, which they did not have to staff all year round.
