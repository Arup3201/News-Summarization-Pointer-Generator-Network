Rangers have agreed an out-of-court settlement with former commercial director Imran Ahmad, who was suing the club for breach of contract.

Ahmad last week won the right to arrest £620,000 from the club's bank account pending the court case in light of their ongoing financial difficulties.

Rangers were given leave to appeal that Court of Session decision with their case due to be heard in two months, but they announced an imminent end to the case in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Friday morning.

Rangers' former commercial director Imran Ahmad has reached an out of court settlement with the club

Ahmad had claimed he was owed £500,000 in unpaid bonuses from Rangers.

The statement read: 'Rangers have agreed formal terms of settlement with former commercial director Imran Ahmad regarding his current court action.

'The sum agreed is significantly less than the total amount which Mr Ahmad had been granted permission to arrest.

'As part of the settlement terms Mr Ahmad has agreed to refrain from arresting funds in Rangers' bank account or in the hands of others pending the formal removal of the case from court.

'No such arrestment will now take place. The case will be formally taken out of court in the next few days.'

Rangers were granted leave to appeal the decision to freeze £620,000 of the club's assets last week

Ahmad was Charles Green's main partner when his consortium took control of Ibrox in an assets purchase of the liquidation-hit Rangers in June 2012.

He left his role in April 2013, while Green had quit as chief executive the previous week following claims over links with former Rangers owner Craig Whyte.

The news of the settlement came hours before the deadline for applications for the latest Rangers share issue, from which the club hope to raise almost £4million.

When the issue was launched two weeks ago, the board issued warnings about their ability to meet financial obligations if the fundraising exercise fails.
