Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has criticised Watford's treatment of his former assistant Billy McKinlay, while defender Chris Baird has called for the Scot to make a hasty return to his previous position.

McKinlay left his post as O'Neill's deputy to become the Hornets' new head coach at the end of last month but was out of a job within just eight days as the club's owners made the baffling decision to replace him with Slavisa Jokanovic - their fourth boss of the season.

In his brief time in charge, the former Scotland international took four points from two games and O'Neill struggled to hide his frustration at McKinlay's circumstances.

'I'm very disappointed for him, and really I think Watford have to look at themselves,' he told Sky Sports News.

'Billy's not done anything untoward there - he went in in difficult circumstances, got a win and a draw and suddenly finds himself out of work again which is very poor.

'There's a human aspect to football as well and I think the owners, technical directors and chief executives need to consider that when they're playing with people's lives in this way.'

O'Neill has been preparing Northern Ireland for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against the Faroe Islands and the trip to Greece three days later.

It is the first time he has worked with the squad without McKinlay's input, with Irish FA elite performance director Jim Magilton and youth team coach Stephen Robinson helping out on this occasion.

Both men already have long-term projects in hand meaning O'Neill's previous number two could feasibly be back in his old post in time for November's trip to Romania.

And Baird, who spent several years working with McKinlay during the pair's time at Fulham, would welcome him with open arms.

'I don't know what the situation is with Billy but he was great working with us and personally I would like to see him come back,' said the West Brom man.

'That's nothing against Jim and Robbo but I would like to see him back with us. He was doing a good job here and obviously I know him well from my time with Fulham.

'I've not spoken to him but I think Michael has, to see what his situation is.

'I would just like to see him back.'

O'Neill has been fully focused on the matches ahead and was more equivocal than Baird when asked if McKinlay would slot back in.

He would likely prefer a commitment until the end of the current campaign from the next appointee while McKinlay, having had the briefest of tastes, may now be minded to persevere finding work as a number one.

'That's something that's really not for now,' said O'Neill.

'We've kept communication going over the week and that's something we can address down the line.' 

Baird, meanwhile, has spoken of his satisfaction at the style of football Northern Ireland have been attempting to play under O'Neill.

The 32-year-old has more than a decade of international football under his belt and was part of the side that came close to a first ever European Championship appearance under Lawrie Sanchez six years ago.

Whether or not O'Neill can take the squad one step better remains to be seen but Baird is happy with the way they are trying.

'Every manager has different ways of playing... With Lawrie I would say we would lump it a bit more. Stick it in the channel, get after it, work hard,' he said.

'Now we're trying to play a bit more, you can see that in the performance and the goals we scored when we beat Hungary last month.

'You don't want to be known for kicking it long. Sometimes that does work but a lot of the players are used to playing at a good level with our clubs and passing on the floor.

'We want to bring that to Northern Ireland too.'
