Arsenal have often complained in the past about Stoke's physical approach to the game at the Britannia. 

Arsene Wenger, however, will feel he has a very genuine grievance to air after Charlie Adam's high challenge on Alexis Sanchez in the 83rd minute. 

With his side trailing 3-2, Sanchez chased after a loose ball but Adam was not far behind.
