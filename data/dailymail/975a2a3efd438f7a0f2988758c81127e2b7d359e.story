Two men belonging to a ‘witches’ coven’ wore ceremonial robes and used daggers as part of ritualistic sex abuse on young girls, a court has heard.

Peter Petrauske, 72, and Jack Kemp, 69, are said to have been involved in a pagan group of ‘white witches’ operating in Cornwall since the 1970s.

The alleged abuse, spanning three decades, involved knives and melting wax, Truro Crown Court heard.

Victims claimed they were plied with alcohol before being made to undress in front of a crowd of men wearing robes.

They were then allegedly abused by their tormentors, before being given money and sweets to buy their silence.

Prosecutor Jason Beal said some of the assaults took the form of rituals, with the victims being made to strip before having their wrists tied.

One victim told police of naked children being forced to dance around ‘like models’ for the adults who were all dressed in robes.

She claimed she was tied to a chair and blindfolded, and on another occasion her wrists were bound and a ceremonial dagger was drawn over her body.

Mr Beal said: ‘She was taken to a house where pagans were present, Jack Kemp was present and “German Pete” (Petrauske) was also there.

‘She was given alcohol, told to dance in front of the camera, and take her clothes off.’

He said the male white witches then exposed themselves and made an indecent proposition.

‘She was given £5 and a bag of sweets,’ Mr Beal added.

Hearing: The trial of the two men at Truro crown court is expected to last four weeks

Another witness, said Mr Beal, spoke of Petrauske being ‘really into witchcraft’ and claimed that he would refer to himself as a chief or lord.

Petrauake allegedly told police that he was a ‘white witch, a pagan and not a Christian’ and ‘the high priest of a white witch coven’.

Detectives discovered daggers, a whip, candles, incense and lavender at his home, the court heard.

The historic abuse was only investigated by police last year when Kemp was arrested in connection with another incident, causing rumours to spread around his home town of Falmouth and prompting the alleged victims to contact detectives.

The abuse charges cover three decades from the late 1970s to 2009.

Kemp faces 15 charges of sexual assaults on youngsters aged between three and 15, while Petrauske, also from Falmouth, faces three charges of indecent assault and one of rape.

The trial of both men is due to last around four weeks.
