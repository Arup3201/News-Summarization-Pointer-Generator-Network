Warm applause fluttered around Wembley as Harry Kane slowly jogged up the touchline in the first half, but on the pitch Danny Welbeck was putting in a performance to indicate he is in no mood to step aside anytime soon.

Roy Hodgson’s selection of Welbeck ahead of the in-form Kane in England Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania divided opinion across the nation ahead of kick-off.

Should he have started the hot-shot Spurs striker, joint-top in the Premier League with Diego Costa on 19 and with 29 in all competitions? Or Welbeck who has been performing well for the national team but in-and-out of Arsenal’s starting line-up, struggling to eight goals in 34?

Former England striker Ian Wright thought the former. ‘Gutted that Harry Kane's not starting,’ he said before kick-off, ‘29 goals, form of his life.’

But within six minutes, the Arsenal man had justified the choice with a huge hand in the opener.

Welbeck started on the left, but was to the right of goal when he nutmegged Lithuania’s Tadas Kijanskas with some nifty footwork and fired a shot across goal, which keeper Giedrius Arlauskis could only parry into the path of Wayne Rooney to head in.

He almost set up a second on 19 minutes, again getting to the byline on the right before crossing deep to Rooney, who looped a header back across goal and on to the post.

Welbeck was bright and alive around the box and got the goal his first-half performance deserved just before the break. Jordan Henderson crossed from the left and he diverted it in off a shoulder via a deflection. They all count.

Kane may be the latest boy wonder, yet Welbeck is the top-scorer in this Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. His goal moved him to six for the tournament, clear of Israel’s Omar Damari on five.

Doubles against Slovenia and Switzerland, a goal versus San Marino and another against Lithuania is not a bad return. Say what you will about the strength of the opposition, but players can only score against what is put in front of them.

Hodgson certainly recognised his value, choosing Welbeck as one of only four players - alongside Rooney, Gary Cahill and Nathaniel Clyne - to start from the last team he picked. Dat Guy Welbz, as he was dubbed by Ravel Morrison providing a nickname that went viral, did not let his manager down. 

He was close to adding another on 41 minutes, riding a challenge and bending a shot towards the top right corner from the edge of the box which was narrowly over.

And again in the 54th, beating two men on his way into the penalty area to the right of goal and powering a shot on target which was pushed out for a corner. He would surely have had a second had Raheem Sterling not arrived in the box a fraction earlier to tap in England’s third.

This may only have been Lithuania, the team ranked 94th in the world, but Welbeck’s passing was crisp and accurate, his runs inventive and movement fluid. An indication of his confidence was a clever back-heel flick in the middle of a quick England passing exchange early in the second half.

England’s front three of Welbeck, Rooney and Raheem Sterling were swapping places all evening causing havoc to Lithuania’s defenders.

Welbeck was substituted for Theo Walcott in the 77th minute, but the sponsors had seen enough to vote him their man-of-the-match.

Kane may have scored within two minutes of coming on, but, for now, Welbeck will be going nowhere in the big games.
