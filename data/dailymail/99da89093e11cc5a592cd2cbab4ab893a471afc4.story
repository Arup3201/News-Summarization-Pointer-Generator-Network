Comedian Tracy Morgan said he has been left in disbelief after Walmart blamed him for a deadly crash with one of their truck drivers. 

Morgan was left seriously injured after a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike in June. His close friend James McNair was killed and two others were injured. 

The group are suing Walmart for negligence because it is believed that the truck driver, Kevin Roper, had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the deadly collision. 

On Monday the company tried to dodge responsibility, saying Morgan and his friends are partly to blame for their injuries because they were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, Morgan responded: 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused.' 

The former 30 Rock star said he felt like he had to respond publicly to Walmart's latest claim, adding that he and his friends did nothing wrong.

Walmart is blaming comedian Tracy Morgan for the injuries he sustained in June when a Walmart truck slammed into his limo bus. His friend James McNair was also killed and two others were injured 

Morgan and friend were returning from a comedy show in Delaware when the Walmart truck collided with their limo bus in June

Morgan's friend James McNair was killed in the crash while accompanying the 45-year-old former Saturday Night Live star back from a show in Delaware. Morgan spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries. 

Walmart Stores Inc., who are based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said in their Monday court filing that the passengers' injuries were caused by their 'failure to properly wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device,' which it says constitutes unreasonable conduct.

If they had been wearing a restraint, Walmart argues that 'all or a portion of the injuries could have been diminished or minimized'.

An attorney representing Morgan and the other plaintiffs has not commented.

Walmart didn't respond to claims that their driver, Kevin Roper, hadn't slept in more than 24 hours before the crash.

The company did admit though that Morgan and his friends' injuries 'may have been caused by third parties over whom Walmart had no control'.

After the deadly crash, Roper was charged with causing the accident. Investigators believe he was dozing off behind the wheel in the moments before the collision and didn't see the traffic ahead of him until it was too late.

'[The] driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' New Jersey State Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. 

'He observed at the last minute -- just prior to impact -- the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.'
