Under threat: Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition could be harmed by the rise of anti-EU party AfP

The coalition currently governing Germany could be under threat from an emerging anti-European Union party, according to the results of an opinion poll.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party looks set to enter German parliament the Bundestag for the first time, after a survey conducted by INSA on behalf of the respected Bild newspaper showed support for the party was growing.

That could spell trouble for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has headed up the ruling coalition between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party and the smaller Free Democratic Party (FDP) since she first came to power in 2005.

And support for the emerging Euro-sceptic party is further proof of German disquiet at having to bail out the struggling economies of some of the southern European states, particularly Greece, and to prop-up the euro indefinitely at a cost of billions.

If the results of the opinion poll are anything to go by, Mrs Merkel's party is set to take a 38 per cent share of the vote, with six per cent going to the FDP.

With a combined 44 per cent of the vote, that that would leave the coalition outnumbered by the other three rival parties in the Bundestag - the centre left Social Democratic Party (SDP), the hard-left Die Linke party and the Greens.

Furthermore, the AfD, which is fighting to have powers repatriated from Brussels, looks set to take five per cent of the vote - the minimum share required to win seats in the Bundestag.

While it is unlikely her main rival – the
centre left SDP – would be able to formulate a working coalition with 
the hard-left Die Linke party, analysts say the entry of an AfD 
bloc would rob Mrs Merkel's coalition of a governing 
majority based on current estimates of its number of seats.

Such
an outcome would most likely force her to form a left-right 'grand 
coalition' with the SDP, who increased their share of the vote by one per cent to 28 per cent in the latest poll.

Although the SDP has publicly stated it does not want a grand coalition, experts believe it would probably enter into one if push came to shove.

The electorate is due to go to the polls on Sunday.
