Reckless: Brendan Matthews was caught speeding at 152mph in his BMW M5

A motorist who was caught speeding at 152mph while his father was sitting in the passenger seat has been banned from driving.

Brendan Matthews, a professional yacht skipper, was caught on camera doing more than twice the 70mph speed limit in his BMW M5.

He was recorded by two police officers who ‘looked at each other in disbelief’ as they tried to keep up with the 28-year-old’s car on the A35 at Puddletown, Dorset.

Matthews admitted he had driven ‘grossly in excess’ of the speed limit but insisted it had only been for a ‘short burst’.

His solicitor explained that as the captain of luxury charter yachts around the Mediterranean, he is used to acting responsible with expensive machinery.

Magistrates heard that Matthews, from Weymouth, Dorset, was spotted by police doing 152mph at 11.32am on February 17 last year on the eastbound A35.

Elizabeth Valera, prosecuting, said a traffic officer’s hand-held speed detection device clocked Matthews’ BMW.

She said: 'A reading of 152mph is taken from that device.

'The crown in this case say that Mr Matthews’ driving fell far below that expected of a competent and careful driver and, indeed, that it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that his driving was dangerous.

'Any other driver on the road would be making manoeuvres expecting vehicles to be travelling at around 70mph.

'Of course 152mph is over double what the speed limit is and that is why the crown says it is dangerous.'

Miss Valera said Matthews’ father had been the front-seat passenger in the car.

Simeon Evans, defending, said: 'Mr Matthews will accept that he was driving grossly in excess of the speed limit - probably very nearly double, or at double the speed limit.

'The irony you have is of a man in an extremely responsible job, he is responsible for machinery worth millions of pounds and the people on them, and he has acted irresponsibly.'

He said: 'There is a real dichotomy there.'

He told the court Matthews was on call to go out to yacht charters at short notice and was a hard-working young man with a very successful career.

Matthews pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and was given an 18 week suspended prison sentence by magistrates in Weymouth.

He was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, pay prosecution costs of £200 and given a two year driving ban.

The record for the fastest driver ever caught in a speed trap was Tim Brady, who was jailed for ten weeks in 2007 after admitting driving a £98,000 Porsche at 172mph.
