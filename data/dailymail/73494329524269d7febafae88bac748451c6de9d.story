A father-of-two has been living in a Denver church basement for the past six months to avoid deportation to his native Mexico.

Arturo Hernandez Garcia, 42, left his wife and two children and moved into the basement of the First Unitarian Society of Denver in October after officials decided to deport him.

The church was able to provide sanctuary because U.S. immigration enforcement officials have a policy of not pursuing 'enforcement actions' in churches and schools.

Now he is in limbo, and he may have to wait 10 years for his citizenship application to be considered because of huge backlogs in the system. 

He is hoping to apply for residency under President Obama's Deferred Action for Parents program.

But the policy has stalled with a federal judge in Texas waiting to hear legal challenges from 17 states.  

Hernandez Garcia has been living in the U.S. illegally since 1999, when he traveled from Chihuahua with his wife and infant daughter on tourist visas, and they stayed.

To pass the time he plays Su Doku and listens to the radio. He fears that if he steps outside he will be arrested. When the church is empty, he runs up and down the stairs for exercise.

He settled in Denver where he and his brother co-own a tile-laying business with six employees. 

In that time his wife also give birth to another daughter and his girls are now 9 and 15.

But a disagreement on a construction site in 2010 lead to assault changes being brought against him, The Denver Post reports. 

He was arrested when a co-worker accused him of pulling a knife on him. 

Hernandez Garcia was eventually acquitted of the charges, but they resulted in him showing up on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's radar and since then he has been fighting deportation proceedings.

After yet another unsuccessful appeal to immigration authorities in August, ICE decided to deport him on October 21, 2014, the same day he took sanctuary in the First Unitarian Society of Denver's church.

Before his fight with ICE, he and his wife had applied for legal permanent resident visas in 2005 through his father-in-law, who is a U.S. citizen, but because of a backlog it could be 2025 before they receive a decision. 

Though confined to the church, Hernandez Garcia says he keeps busy. 

He has painted the walls in the church offices. His family, friends and supporters frequently visit.

 With help from the American Friends Service Committee and legal counsel, Garcia is also trying to get his case re-opened.

'I don't have a criminal record, I have more than ten years [in the United States], I have kids,' said Garcia. 'I think I have a good case. But the courts say no.'

As of May, Garcia could apply under Obama's Deffered Action for Parents Plan. The bill means all parents of legal citizen children born on or before November 20, 2014 are eligible.

Since October Hernandez Garcia has been living in the First Unitarian Church where he has painted the walls and watched TV to keep him company

Hernandez Garcia hopes his ordeal will help spotlight the legal challenges immigrants continue to face across the country

But getting approved will take months, and Garcia is worried that he could be removed from his family and deported in the meantime. 

On December 2, Garcia's wife, Ana, as well as their two daughters, traveled to Washington, D.C. to try to halt his deportation. 

While there, they met with two officials from the Department of Homeland Security and members of the Colorado Congressional delegation. 

Representatives Diana DeGette, Jared Polis and Ed Perlmutter all signed on to a request for 'stay of removal' for Garcia, and the day after the family returned to Denver, Garcia's attorney sent in the paperwork to re-open his case. He has yet to hear back. 

Hernandez Garcia says he will claim sanctuary until he knows he will not be deported, he says. 

He hopes his ordeal will help spotlight the legal challenges immigrants continue to face across the country.

His campaign is being backed by the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, who have taken in other immigrants who face deportation
