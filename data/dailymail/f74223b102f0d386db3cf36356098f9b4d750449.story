Los Angeles police say a man was killed when he fell out of a tree and impaled himself on the spikes of a metal fence after a night of heavy drinking.

Sgt. Melvin Gamble says the victim appears to have fallen about 20 feet from a tree branch onto a spiked fence.

The man had climbed up the tree to retrieve a jacket before falling on the fence, LAPD Captain Brian Pratt said hours after the gruesome discovery was made.

There wasn’t a lot of blood at the scene, and investigators believed he likely died from internal bleeding, the sergeant stated. 

The incident was reported shortly after 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning in East Hollywood.

The coroner's office identified the victim as 30-year-old Edwin Ochoa.

Gamble says more than a dozen empty beer cans were found around the tree. 

The fence went clear through the left side of his face and exited out the right side, Gamble said. 

Local residents tell police the man was known as a heavy drinker.

Police say the death appears to be accidental.
