Veteran ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas appeared on 'Good Morning America' Friday to publicly discuss for the first time her addiction to alcohol, which she had been keeping a secret for many years.

Vargas, 51, will be back co-hosting '20/20' tonight for the first time since October, when she took a leave of absence to seek treatment for her problem.

'I am an alcoholic,' Vargas told George Stephanopoulos in an interview pre-taped Thursday night. 'It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time to admit it to my family, but I am.'

Tete-a-tete: Vargas sat down for an interview with her long-time colleague George Stephanopoulos on the eve of her return to '20/20'

Looking back on the years Vargas said she had spent hiding her addiction from her colleagues and friends, the TV presenter summed up the experience as 'exhausting' and a 'staggering burden to carry.'

‘You become so isolated with the secret and so lonely, because you can’t tell anyone what’s happening,’ she explained.

Vargas, a married mother of two, told Stephanopoulos that for a long time she was living in denial about her addiction.

‘I started thinking “Well, you know, I’ll only drink, you know, on weekends,” she said with a laugh. ‘I’ll only drink, you know, two glasses of wine a night. I won’t drink on nights before I have to get up and do “Good Morning America.” But those deals never work.’

She initially had entered rehab in the fall, but left after 28 days against her doctors' wishes.

Vargas came home for five days, but then returned to the treatment center and remained there until the medical staff gave her the green light to leave.

Her most recent Twitter message was 
posted in mid-November announcing her return from the treatment facility
 where she had been staying.

'Hello
 everyone!  I am home, and so grateful for all your support and well 
wishes. I am so much better and taking it one day at a time,' she wrote 
to her 40,000 followers.  

'We are proud of the steps Elizabeth has taken and are pulling for her recovery,' an ABC spokesperson said at the time.

According
 to the New York Daily News, senior staff at ABC were told last October 
Vargas was on 'medical leave', but many suspected she was being treated 
for alcoholism.

When asked about the cause of her 
addiction, Vargas revealed that she has been suffering from severe 
anxiety since she was a little girl.

Vargas'
 father served in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and she recalled that 
when her mother would leave the house to go to work, she suffered daily panic 
attacks that carried into adulthood.

The Emmy-winning journalist recalled how one time she even had a panic attack on air while anchoring a live news show on Chicago's WBBM, where she got her start before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for Dateline.

Vargas'
 husband, Grammy Award-winning singer Marc Cohn, was the only one who 
knew about her struggles with alcohol, and when he finally confronted 
her, the ABC anchor recalled feeling 'really angry' while acknowledging 
that he was right.

However,
 it took her a long time to seek treatment because Vargas said she did 
not want to feel like a failure and was still able to function in her daily 
life.

Vargas recalled that 
her ‘aha' moment came one day when she arrived at work to film a '20/20'
 segment and realized that she was too drunk to do it.

Every
 night like clockwork, the TV host and mother of two would come home and
 have a glass of wine - her drink of choice that was dubbed 'mommy's 
juice' by her 10-year-old son, Zachary.

'I thought that was hysterical,' she recalled. 'It didn’t occur to me that that was a problem.' 

Vargas said she used wine to treat her anxiety and deal with the stresses of her work.

‘That’s
 exhausting, to live like that. And it becomes very easy to think “I 
deserve this glass of wine. I’m so stressed out …,”’ she said.

As
 a co-anchor of '20/20' since 2004, Vergas had done six specials on drinking, but 
reporting on alcoholism in others had failed to give her the push she 
needed to seek help for herself.

When
 Vargas finally decided to enter rehab this fall, she and her husband 
told their sons that she was suffering from an alcohol allergy.

‘I
 didn’t want to use the word “disease” with them, even though that’s how
 it’s classified by the medical profession,’ she said. ‘It’s too scary, 
you know, the connotation for them is disease is something deadly.’

Vargas
 admitted that even now it is hard for her not to drink, but she has 
been relying on prayers, meditation and a great support system to 
conquer her urges triggered by stress.

‘There
 are lots of people who feel a lot of stress,’ she said. ‘Not everybody 
turns to a glass of wine or three like I did, or four, like I did on 
some occasions. What I learned to do when I was away was to feel the 
feelings.’

The 51-year-old anchor is also a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and has a sponsor.

'Alcohol for me is no longer an option,' Vargas concluded.
