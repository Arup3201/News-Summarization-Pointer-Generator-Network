Donations in memory of a charity fundraiser who collapsed and died in front of his girlfriend as he cycled up a steep hill have reached £30,000.

Kris Cook went into cardiac arrest 46 miles into his first cycle race as girlfriend Nicola Tait and friends looked on on Sunday at around 1pm.

The 36-year-old was taking part in the Prudential RideLondon 100 course to raise money for two hospices which cared for his late grandparents - and had originally set himself a target of £500.

Donations to Mr Cook (pictured third from left with the rest of his cycling team) have now topped £27,000

Miss Tait, 35, said his last words were 'I'll meet you at the top of the hill Nic' but he collapsed shortly afterwards.

The civil servant is said to have complained of sharp chest pains at the bottom of the hill.

Mr Cook died at 2.35pm after being airlifted from the scene.

Donations on his fundraising page will go to the Woking and Sam Beare Hospices in Woking, Surrey.

The RideLondon course was shortened 
from 100 miles to 86 miles amid fears for the safety
 of the 25,000 riders due to heavy rain and high winds.

Miss Tait urged people to donate to the cause supported by her partner, from Woking, Surrey.

'I
 really want everyone to know, he was just the most wonderful person, he
 was so beautiful, he looked after me and everyone,' she said.

Mr Cook, 36, collapsed at Newlands Corner, while part of a group of 12 riders raising money for Woking Hospice. His mother said that he had died doing something he loved and welcomed donations his memory

'He was so kind and so generous, I just can't believe he was taken because it is just so unfair.'The couple both had grandparents who were cared for at the Sam Beare Hospice.

Mr Cook worked in the prison service as a director for the safety of young people in public sector prisons.

According to the event’s organisers, his mother said he died 'doing something he loved'.

She welcomed donations in his memory to his fundraising page at www.justgiving.com/Kris-Cook where her son previously wrote: 'I have never taken on a challenge such as this.'

A spokeswoman for Prudential RideLondon said: 'Kris Cook, aged 36, collapsed at Newlands Corner from a sudden cardiac arrest and, although prompt medical attention was provided by event doctors on the scene, his death was later confirmed after further attempts to revive him at hospital.'

She added: 'The organisers of the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 would like to express their sincere condolences to Kris’s family and friends.'

A post-mortem examination will be carried out to establish Mr Cook’s cause of death.
