A painting of a scruffy-looking Sir Les Patterson, with a cheeky grin and a food-stained shirt, has taken out this year's Archibald Packing Room Prize.

The portrait, titled Sir Les, is by 2012 Archibald Prize winner Tim Storrier.

Dr Sir Leslie Colin Patterson KCB AO is one of comedian Barry Humphries' favourite characters - and his most politically incorrect.

Head storeman Steve Peters, who has the final say with 51 per cent of the vote, delivered his verdict on Thursday at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

Never has the Packing Room Prize coincided with the Archibald judges' decision.

'Kiss of death! That's me,' Peters told AAP.

'But I hope not for Tim's sake. It's one of the great mysteries of the world, I'm dumbfounded why they never win.'

Peters said the decision came down to Storrier's Sir Les and Rodney Pople's portrait of Humphries. They will hang side by side in the gallery.

In a statement, Sir Les Patterson said he was proud to be in the show.

'Thanks to that clever bastard Tim Storrier and his brushwork, generations of young australian art lovers, in particular the nubile members of the opposite sex in the community, will look up to what I have to offer,' he said.

'And with any luck, like the eyes of the Mona Lisa, it will follow them around the room.'

Born in Sydney, Storrier now lives in Bowral with his wife of 24 years, Jane.

He started painting from a young age, starting formal art studies under Australian artist Ross Doig at Sydney Church of England Grammar School in his teenage years.

The 65-year-old was awarded an Order of Australia AM for his services to art in 1994.

He also has a Doctor of Arts with honours from Charles Sturt University in New South Wales and is a trustee of the Art Gallery of NSW.

There were almost 900 entries this year and Peters reckons the calibre of art is higher than last year.

'I think it's a better show overall. There's more finalists, and a lot of small ones this year, so the artists took the hint.'

Finalists for the 93rd Archibald Prize were also announced on Thursday.

Leading contenders include Tim Maguire's portrait of actress Cate Blanchett, Alan Jones' painting of AFL footballer Adam Goodes, Zoe Young's portrait of snowboarder Torah Bright and Fiona Lowry's portrait of architect Penelope Seidler.

This year is a particularly good one for female artists, with nearly half of the 54 paintings hung in the exhibition by women.

The winner will be announced on July 18 with the exhibition of finalists to go on display from July 19 to September 28 at the Art Gallery of NSW.
