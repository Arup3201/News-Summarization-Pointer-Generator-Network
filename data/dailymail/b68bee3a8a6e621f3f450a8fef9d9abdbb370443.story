Music teacher Helen Smith, 42, is accused of setting up fake piano exams at her home in Stadbroke, Sheffield

A music teacher arranged for students to take sham piano exams in front of a phoney  official, a court heard.

Helen Smith held the examinations at her home and five pupils paid their fees and took the tests believing them to be genuine.

They were told later they had passed with either a merit or distinction, it was alleged.

But some became suspicious when certificates failed to arrive and the examining board told them there was no record of any test being carried out.

The combined cost of all the exam fees and additional lessons was around £1,600, Sheffield Magistrates’ Court was told.

Smith, 42, denied six counts of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud by false representation between February 2012 and March this year.

Two adults and three teenagers had to play their test pieces before an unknown woman enlisted by Smith who claimed to be approved by the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, it was alleged.

Prosecutor David Godfrey said: ‘The defendant arranged for a fake examiner to attend and took considerable efforts to give it the appearance of an official examination.’

Student Andrea Jackson said she was elated when told by her teacher shortly after the Grade 5 exam on December 15, 2012, that she had passed with a distinction.

When no certificate arrived she called the ABRSM, which had no record of an exam on that day.

‘I was very upset,’ Miss Jackson said. ‘I felt the rug had been pulled from under my feet.’

Sheffield Magistrates' Court was told the combined cost of all the exam fees and additional piano lessons was around £1,600

When she raised the matter with Smith she was told she had broken data protection laws by asking the ABRSM for information.

The court heard the board sent a cheque for £264.90 to Smith for cancelled exams which was cashed in July 2012. It included a full refund for an exam due to have been taken by Miss Jackson.

Lynne Butler, of the ABRSM, said Smith told the board the reason for Miss Jackson cancelling was that her father had died, which turned out to be false.

Sharon Copley, the mother of a teenage pupil, was told to attend Smith’s house in Sheffield for a Grade 5 piano exam instead of another official exam they had booked. Mrs Copley said her daughter was devastated to discover the exam was not genuine.

She said: ‘To be told by somebody you trusted that you have passed with a distinction and to then find out the person she looked up to hadn’t told the truth, she felt humiliated and let down. It knocked her for six.’

Smith claimed she had arranged the exams in good faith with the ABRSM and blamed an administrative error for the lack of accurate records.

She said she thought the woman was an official examiner. ‘I feel very hurt and betrayed and let down by the board’s inaccuracies or whatever has happened,’ she told the court. ‘I did my job as a music teacher to make sure they took their exams.’

The court heard that Smith, who represented herself, had previously been banned from teaching in schools for two years by the  General Teaching Council after claiming sick pay while being  on holiday.

Judgement was reserved to a later date.
