One plucky Commonwealth Games fan failed in his attempt to to keep up with Kenya's Flomena Cheyech Daniel and Caroline Kilel during the women's marathon, as his pavement dash came crashing to a halt.

The boy started sprinting alongside Daniel and Kilel, who finished first and second respectively, but their pace got the better of him as he went tumbling to the floor.

Daniel took the women's crown in 2hr 26mins 45secs, with her compatriot Kilel grabbing silver and Australian Jess Trengove finishing in the bronze-medal position.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch a clip of the boy as he tries to keep up with the Kenyan runners

Starting off: The boy sprints ahead of the two Kenyan runners just after the two-hour mark

Burst of pace: He starts strongly but Kilel, right, and Daniel, left soon make up the ground

Tumble: The young boy loses his footing as he tries to match the pace of the gold and silver medallists

Bowing out: Kilel, right, and Daniel, left, seem unaware of the boy losing his grip on the pavement to their left

Out of the race: The boy tumbles over as the race continues on the road

Focussed: Kilel, right, and Daniel, left, went on to win silver and gold respectively

Scottish runner Susan Partridge was the best home-nations performer, finishing sixth in 2hrs 32mins 18secs, although earlier in the race there looked to be a realistic chance of a British medal.

Aly Dixon led after 45 minutes but eventually tailed off and had to drop out with a calf problem, while her England team-mates Louise Damen and Amy Whitehead both managed a top-10 finish.

Compatriots: Caroline Kilel and Flomena Daniel of Kenya won silver and gold in the women's marathon
