Sergio Ramos has hailed Andres Iniesta as the 'boyfriend that every mother would want' for their daughter while admitting it's a shame his Spain team-mate will never play for Real Madrid.

Iniesta, 30, has enjoyed a long and fruitful career with Barcelona, winning a host of honours including six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues during his 19 years at the Nou Camp.

As well as being a star on the pitch, it would seem Iniesta is also a perfect gentleman away from the field.

Ramos said: 'Iniesta is the boyfriend that every mother wants,' he said at a press conference. 'The figures over his career tell you all you need to know. He is a magical player.

'There are few players in the world that can compare to him, but unfortunately he is not with us at Real Madrid.'

The Spanish duo are set to take to the field together on Friday as Vicente del Bosque's side take on Ukraine in their Euro 2016 qualifier.
