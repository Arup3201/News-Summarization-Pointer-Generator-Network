The whistleblower who was forced out of the Lib Dems and made to sign a gagging order over the Lord Rennard allegations has been named as former head of fundraising Helen Jardine-Brown

Fresh details emerged last night about the whistleblower who was forced out of the Liberal Democrats and made to sign a gagging order over the Lord Rennard allegations.

She was named as Helen Jardine-Brown, a former head of fund-raising, who was pregnant at the time.

When she approached senior Lib Dems four years ago with claims about Lord Rennard’s behaviour, she was told Nick Clegg would call her directly, but was never contacted.

Less than two months later, her post was allegedly cut, shortly after she told her boss that she was pregnant. She was told her role was going as part of a ‘re-organisation’.

Miss Jardine-Brown eventually reached a £50,000 settlement with the party on condition of her silence.

On Saturday, the Daily Mail revealed that a high-ranking woman official had been sacked but did not name her.

It is believed Miss Jardine-Brown raised concerns about Lord Rennard’s behaviour in September 2008, during an interview with senior officials at the party. Less than eight weeks later, after informing her employer she was pregnant, she was told her role was to be cut.

Sources told the Daily Telegraph she was offered the chance to reapply for a more junior role, which she rejected.

Miss Jardine-Brown, who has declined to comment on the case, filed a formal complaint against the Lib Dem chief executive and the party on grounds of sex and disability discrimination. In November 2009, she reached a settlement with the party on condition that she did not discuss the case or the terms.

Former Lib Dem party member Alison Smith described an ordeal involving Lord Rennard's alleged inappropriate behaviour back in 2007

A Lib Dem spokesman said he was unable
to discuss the case ‘for the same reason the person involved can’t’.

He
added: ‘I can, however, confirm this case had absolutely nothing to do 
with the recent allegations involving Lord Rennard.’

Meanwhile,
damning new allegations that Lord Rennard pestered two women activists 
for sex after buying them dinner emerged yesterday.

The party’s then chief executive 
invited the women back to his London flat for a late-night drink but 
then ‘locked the doors’ and suggested they ‘go upstairs’, according to 
new evidence.

Alison Smith, then a party member but now an Oxford University politics lecturer, and a fellow Lib Dem – referred to as A – endured the ordeal in 2007, it is claimed.

Miss Smith’s account appears to be corroborated by an ITN News interview with a senior Lib Dem official in 2009 as part of an investigation into claims about Lord Rennard.

The incident allegedly happened after Miss Smith stepped down as a parliamentary candidate. The official told the broadcaster: ‘Chris Rennard offered to take A and Al out for dinner to commiserate with Al for having to give up her seat.

‘Rennard invited them back to his 
house for a drink. After dinner . . . he locked the doors – they didn’t 
realise that he had locked the doors, but he had. [He] came and sat 
between them and neither of them remember precisely the wording, but the
intention was “Come on, girls, let’s go upstairs”, which came as a 
great shock to both of them.

‘I think it [Lord Rennard’s behaviour] is something that some people know. There is a knowledge at a senior level.’

The official said Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was aware of the alleged incident and other allegations by September 2008.

Miss Smith said last week: ‘He just very suddenly got up and plonked himself between us and started moving his hands down our backs and places where they had absolutely no business being. It was both of us at the same time. I straight away stood up and said: “No, that’s not acceptable. I’m going home”.’

Lord Rennard has strenuously denied any inappropriate behaviour and has insisted he did not lock the door at his home while the women were there in 2007.
