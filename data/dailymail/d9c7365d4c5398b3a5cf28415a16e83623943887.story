Argentina reacted with fury last night at calls for the capital of the Falkland Islands to be renamed Port Margaret in honour of its liberator.

The country’s foreign minister Héctor Timerman insisted a move to rename Port Stanley, also known simply as Stanley, would be in breach of United Nations resolutions and would not be recognised by his country.

‘I couldn’t care less if they call it Port Margaret, Margarita or Margarona,’ he declared. ‘Argentina and the United Nations will not recognise it.’

The Mail revealed that senior MPs are suggesting that the Falklands capital should be renamed Port Margaret in honour of Lady Thatcher, who ordered the military campaign to save it from Argentine invasion in 1982.

Port Stanley is currently named after Edward Smith-Stanley, who was the British prime minister three times in the mid-19th century, but never actually set foot in the Falklands.

Renaming it after Lady Thatcher would infuriate Argentina’s erratic president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who has been making increasingly provocative remarks about the sovereignty of the islands around the 30th anniversary of the conflict.

But bookmakers are offering odds of 5/1 that islanders would agree to bestowing the honour on the woman who many still hero-worship.

Argentina refers to the Falklands as Las Malvinas and to Port Stanley as Puerto Argentino. Mr Timerman insisted changing the name of Port Stanley would breach United Nations resolutions.

‘[The resolutions] say that sides must 
abstain from making changes in the conflict zone that alter its status 
quo at the time the conflict began,’ he insisted.

‘Britain keeps violating UN resolutions. Then they use those same resolutions to bomb other countries.’

Tobias Ellwood, a Parliamentary aide at the Foreign Office who led a successful campaign to have the tower that houses Big Ben renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, insisted dedicating the capital to Lady Thatcher would be appropriate, as long as the islanders agree.

‘Thatcher’s legacy may be complex but the primary role she played in the Falklands chapter is undisputed - renaming Stanley Port Margaret would be a fitting tribute,’ Mr Ellwood said.

Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, one of Lady Thatcher’s closest allies, said renaming the capital was a ‘matter for the Falkland Islands’.

But he added: ‘If there is not already a
 memorial to her in the islands, there should be, and if the Argentines 
would like us to put one up in Buenos Aires I’m sure someone will 
oblige.

'She did get rid of the junta for them, 
after all, which is something the Argentine ambassador of the day 
thanked me for profusely.’

Sharon Bulic Zuvic, a fourth-generation Falkland islander, agreed: ‘It would be a fitting tribute. As long as a majority of people here agreed, I think it could be a good thing.’

Alison Howe, owner of Harbour View Gift Shop in Stanley, said: ‘Falkland Islanders tend to think a lot before making a decision - they never rush into things. So like them I would have to think about the idea first. We’re all forever grateful to Thatcher.’

Mr Timerman also insisted that he did not care that neither he or Mrs Kirchner had been invited to Lady Thatcher’s funeral next week – with Argentina only invited to send its British ambassador. The snub brackets Argentina with North Korea and Zimbabwe.

‘What do I care if they invite me to a place I hadn’t planned to go?’ Mr Timerman said. ‘The woman died. Let her family hold a wake for her in peace.’

Lady Thatcher will be buried as a war leader next Wednesday, with soldiers that fought in the Falklands War due to accompany her body to St. Paul’s Cathedral.
