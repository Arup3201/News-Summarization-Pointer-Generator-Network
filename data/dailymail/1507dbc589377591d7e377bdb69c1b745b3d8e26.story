Fake advertisements claiming iPhones can be charged by putting them in the microwave have caught out unwary users whose phones have been set on fire or left a smoking ruin when they've tried it.

Apple has been frantically trying to hose down the ad by internet pranksters 4-Chan, Tweeting warnings that it is a hoax and asking followers to urgently retweet the message.

'Heard of #AppleWave? IT'S A HOAX & WILL DESTROY YOUR IPHONE,' said a Tweet from the Apple iOS Support account. 'Please help spread the word!'

The warning came to late for many who fell for the convincing mock-up ad. 

Hoax ad: Internet prankster group 4-Chan shared the this fake advertisement

Posted originally by the notorious internet pranksters 4-Chan, the 'IOS 8 exclusive' Wave ad was designed to precisely mimic an update from Apple Inc following the release of their new software one week ago.

'Wave allows your device to be charged wirelessly through microwave frequencies,' the post read. 'Wave can be used to quickly charge your device's battery using any standard household microwave.' 

It instructs users to 'charge' their phones for 60 second at 700 watts or 70 seconds at 800 watts, while warning, 'Do not wave-charge for over 300 seconds'.

Gullible users took to their microwaves, and then to Twitter to show the results as a warning to other users by sharing images of smoking, cracked and flaming iPhones.

The rogue instructions said to 'charge' the iPhone for 60 second at 700 watts or 70 seconds at 800 watts, while warning, 'Do no wave-charge for over 300 seconds'

The hoax was taken seriously by enough people for the Los Angeles Police Department to issue a warning.

'This #Wave capability is a #hoax. Don't be fooled into microwaving your #iPhone 6,' LAPD Communications tweeted.

The Los Angeles Fire Department have also issued warnings on radio stations, according to Nine News. 

'We were alarmed at this notion, because of course any metal inside of a microwave oven can lead to a fire and potentially an explosion,' spokesman Brian Humphrey said.

Gullible iPhone users found their phones erupted into flames or began to crack and smoke, and took to social media to warn others

'So we're asking people to read the instructions on their smartphone device and realise there's no shortcut,' he said.

Apple's iOS Support is frantically tweeting warnings to their customers while trying to keep up with Twitter trolls who continue to report Wave as an effective phone charging method.

The hoax is not the first prank to be played by 4-Chan, who previously convinced many iPhone users that the iOS7 update would make their mobile phones waterproof.
