When you see someone falling over on an icy pavement, most people's first reaction is to help them up and check they're not hurt.

But that wasn't the case with this mystery cameraman in Norwich, who noticed everyone falling over at a particular spot in the frozen city centre.

Instead, he or she decided to set up their camera in the building opposite and film people as they tried, usually without success, to negotiate the tricky patch of pavement.

Going: A pedestrian on Norwich's Duke Street decides to try his luck on the ice despite the warning cones

Going: The pedestrian's high-visibility jacket is of no use to him as he loses his footing on the treacherous ice

Gone: The poor man lands heavily on his left side and a passer-by rushes to help after he's beaten by the ice

The result is an unfortunately hilarious piece of footage showing pedestrian after pedestrian after stubborn pedestrian come a cropper on the ice.

Like penguins in a nature documentary, one person after the other decides to ignore the warning sign and traffic cones and try their luck on the Duke Street bridge over the River Wensum.

The film, which is accompanied by trance music, was watched more than 25,000 times in the 24 hours after it was posted yesterday.

Entitled 'Duke Street Hazard', as a reference to the popular 1980s American TV series The Dukes of Hazzard, it says: 'There is a single spot where it is almost inevitable not to fall over, as you can see!'

It shows dozens of pedestrians, thankfully none of them wearing Daisy Duke's tiny hotpants, skid and land heavily on their bottoms as they try to get past the ice.

Hundreds of people posted comments, with one saying: 'Everyone was probably thinking to themselvesï»¿ "I hope nobody saw that".

'Actually the whole internet will see that ;)'.

They keep on coming: Another unsuspecting person comes a cropper beside the warning traffic cones

Sore bottom: The pedestrian looks like he must have hurt himself when he fell backwards onto the ice

Better in good weather: A view of Norwich's Duke Street looking towards the bridge where so many fell

While the majority of the UK got its first proper snowfall today, Norwich was blanketed in snow at the beginning of the week, causing schools to close and transport chaos as trains, buses and even flights to and from Norwich airport were cancelled or delayed.

Norfolk escaped more heavy snow this morning but it was forecast to fall this afternoon as blizzard conditions spread across the country from the west.

Wales and the West Country were particularly badly hit, with hundreds of schools closed and motorists facing treacherous conditions.

The M4 motorway was closed between Bristol and Bath and trains and flights delayed as Bristol and Cardiff airports were closed.

'I wonder what the weather's got in store?': This pedestrian looks like he's checking his mobile as he walks

Steady! The ice, which gets more and more dangerous, gets the upper hand as the man loses his footing

No John Travolta: The pedestrian joins the long list of casualties as he heads for a certain fall on the winter ice

And he's gone: The Duke Street Hazard claims yet another victim to add to a very long list

Three down...: One after another, the tumbling pedestrians fell victim to the slippery ice on the bridge

Easy does it: This pedestrian thought that gentle tiptoeing might get them across... but it didn't

Embarrassing: Falling over on the ice is humiliating enough without it being filmed and put on YouTube

Traffic cones and warning signs are no deterrent to the foolhardy
