A incredibly well-preserved example of a fossilised marine creature is set to fetch £100,000 at auction.

The 6ft long ichthyosaur was discovered by a fossil hunter at low tide after rough seas tore away a section of cliff.

The unnamed fossil enthusiast worked tirelessly for three days to collect the 200 million-year-old remains before expected storms would have ultimately destroyed it.

The 6ft long ichthyosaur (pictured) was uncovered in the late 1990s and is now up for auction. The beasts would have looked similar to dolphins but were reptilian

He removed sections of rock from the cliffs known as Black Ven, near Lyme Regis, Dorset, and took them to local preparator Chris Moore.

Mr Moore then spent hundreds of hours chipping away at the rock to expose the fossilised bones of the ichthyosaur.

The result is one of the most impressive examples ever found, with the ichthyosaur in the same leaping position as when it died.

Remarkably, one of its paddles on its side is preserved in 3D protruding from its body at an angle of 45 degrees.

Ichthyosaurs - literally meaning 'fish-lizards' - were giant marine reptiles that resembled dolphins and thrived during much of the Mesozoic era.

These huge animals rapidly diversified from being lizards with fins to developing a much more streamlined, fish-like form built for speed.

One species has been calculated to have a cruising speed of 22mph (36 km/h). 

They first appeared approximately 245 million years ago  and at least one species survived until about 90 million years ago.

The reptiles were particularly abundant in the Jurassic Period, until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by another reptilian order, the plesiosaurs, in the Cretaceous Period.

The specimen, that was uncovered in the late 1990s, is now being offered for sale at Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

It has a pre-sale estimate of 80,000 pounds but is likely to go for more.

Errol Fuller, a natural history expert and curator for the auction, said: 'When you find fossils like this one them they aren’t in the state that you now see.

'A lot of the bone is covered in rock, probably is three or four very solid lumps and the finder would have had to use a wheelbarrow or something to remove it.

'It had been exposed on a ledge by rough tides and had the fossil hunter not found it itcould have been washed away and broken up very quickly.

'The fossil was prepared by Chris Moore at his workshop in Charmouth. The rock had to be drilled away very carefully, it is a painstakingly slow process.

'We are talking about a huge amount of work that has gone into preparing it.

'It is complete and in a beautiful state of preservation and has been very well prepared.”

Ichthyosaurs swam in the sea at the same time dinosaurs roamed the land, which was around 220 to 65 million years ago.

The beasts would have looked similar to dolphins but were reptilian.

Mary Anning, born in 1799 in Lyme Regis, helped extract a complete ichthyosaur when she was just 12 years old.

The ichthyosaur is being sold on November 27.
