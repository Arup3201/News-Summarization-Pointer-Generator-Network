The next generation of German footballers matched their senior counterparts with another trophy win for the World Cup winners at the Under-19 European Championships.

Hertha Berlin midfielder Hany Mukhtar scored the only goal in the final as the Germans saw off Portugal 1-0 in Budapest.

It comes at the end of a summer of success which saw the senior side lift the World Cup in Brazil after beating Argentina - and the rest of the world's nations will be looking over worried about the next generation of successful Germans coming through.
