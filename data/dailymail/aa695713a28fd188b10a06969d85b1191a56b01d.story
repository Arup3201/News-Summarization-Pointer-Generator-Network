His summer got off to a bad start after Roy Hodgson omitted him from the England squad for what has proved to be a disastrous World Cup campaign in Brazil.

But as the squad ready themselves for an early flight home after two embarrassing defeats, midfielder Tom Cleverley is reportedly on a high after proposing to stunning girlfriend Georgina Dorsett.

According to sources the Manchester United ace wooed Georgina, a former TOWIE star, with a £20,000 engagement ring during a trip to Las Vegas.

‘Georgina had been waiting for him to ask but he wanted the perfect moment,’ a friend told The Sun.

‘No expense was spared. Tom has taken her for amazing meals with red rose petals scattered on the table and he’s made sure that she’s had the time of her life.’ 

The 24-year-old was reeling last season after 17,000 England fans signed a petition insisting he be banned from the national squad – a move that was slammed by his then manager, David Moyes.

‘Tom Cleverley is a fantastic young player who's developing all the time,’ said the Scot in March. 

‘He is a great trainer. He is first out 
and every day he does his best in training. He always gives his best and
 that is why he will succeed.’ 

The contentious petition is said to be another reason behind the playmaker’s proposal.

The source added: ‘Georgina’s been a big support for him and I think he wanted to show how grateful he was.’

Cleverley has been with Dorsett since 2012 and welcomed the birth of their first child, daughter Nevaeh, last June.

He won 13 England caps before falling out of favour with manager Hodgson shortly before the 23-man World Cup squad was announced.
