With an elegant spiral staircase, chic pale decor, roaring log fires and spectacular mountain views, Chalet Eidelweiss in Courchevel is the epitome of alpine chic.

But you'll need to be a billionaire to afford it - the luxury holiday home in the exclusive French resort of Courchevel costs an eye-watering £80,000 to hire for just one week.

So what do you get for your money? Along with eight bedrooms, each of which has been individually decorated, the seven-floor chalet boasts two massage rooms, a hammam and a library bulging with books.

Luxury: Chalet Eidelweiss boasts a chic neutral colour scheme throughout, stunning views of the mountains and has roaring open fires tended by permanent staff

Soiree: The chalet has its own night club, complete with comfortable sofas and a fully stocked bar, in which to throw your own private party with family and friends

Convenient: If skiing feels like too much effort, the chalet has a huge indoor pool as well as two massage rooms and a Turkish hammam (steam bath)

For those in search of more high octane pursuits, the chalet boasts its very own nightclub, complete with vast sofas, a conveniently located indoor hot tub, a private dance floor and a fully stocked bar.

Sportier guests can take advantage of Chalet Eidelweiss' indoor swimming pool, hot tub and gym or take to the slopes - located on the doorstep - with the chalet's resident ski instructor.

Although Courchevel, long a jetset favourite, has no shortage of Michelin starred restaurants, the chalet also comes with a full complement of staff, including two personal chefs ready to rustle up your favourite food - and two butlers to serve it.

For those who fancy a trip down to the village, there's a personal chauffeur and a concierge to arrange activities, while for those who'd rather relax, the chalet boasts a private massage therapist.

Vast: The seven-story building has been described as the Alpine equivalent of Buckingham Palace and sleeps up to 16 people in its eight huge bedrooms

Pool party: The chalet's indoor hot tub is located inside the bar and nightclub area - ideal for an evening in your bikini, sipping glühwein

Comfortable: Each of the vast bedrooms comes with stunning Alpine views and an equally gargantuan plasma screen TV and day bed

En-suite: The two master bedrooms have their own private bathrooms, complete with a beaten silver tub and luxury bath and body products

Explaining why the chalet is worth the outlay, Rupert Longsdon, founder and director of the Oxford Ski Company which markets the palatial bolthole said: 'It's not every day one has the opportunity to stay in the best private home in what is arguably the best ski resort in the Alps.

'You can't rent Buckingham Palace but you can rent Chalet Edelweiss in Courchevel 1850. You could, of course, stay in one of the many first class five star hotels in this resort, but one can stay in hotels all over the world.

'Booking a private chalet for a holiday is like owning you own chalet in the Alps for a week. What's more, chalets like Edelweiss come fully serviced and catered to a seriously high standard.

'Think Downtown Abbey style service - you will want for nothing. Chalet holidays are a rare treat where you can be spoilt rotten and enjoy the privacy with your friends and family around you - that is if you can find to them in Edelweiss between the swimming pool, spa, cinema, games rooms or night club.'

Cosy: Despite its large size, Chalet Eidelweiss is kept warm and well-stocked by its complement of full-time staff, including a concierge, chauffeur and two butlers

Spectacular: Other staff based at the chalet include housekeepers, a massage therapist and a ski instructor familiar with the neighbouring Bellecote piste

Fine dining: The chalet comes complete with two private chefs, ready to rustle up foodie favourites, and two butlers to serve it

Sporty:
 For those who need to work off a few calories after indulging in 
delicious fare created by the two private chefs, there's a fully stocked
 gym

Exclusive: Dubbed the 'St Tropez of winter', Courchevel is hugely popular with the jetset and has previously welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge among others

Located in the spectacular Trois Vallées region of France, Courchevel is the name given to four interconnected villages; Courchevel 1300 (Le Praz), Courchevel 1550, Courchevel 1650 (Moriond), and Courchevel 1850.

Of the four, Courchevel 1850, the highest of the villages, is the most exclusive and as a result, has become a mecca for A-listers, royals and well-heeled travellers alike.

With more five star hotels than Paris, two ultra-exclusive 'six star' boltholes and no fewer than 11 Michelin starred restaurants, it's no surprise that fans such as Victoria Beckham, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Cameron Diaz and Zinedine Zidane just can't stay away.

For those who can't quite stretch to a weekend in Courchevel, the nearby resorts of Val d'Isère and Méribel are good alternatives, while across the border in Switzerland, Verbier and Zermatt both offer perfect pistes with the chance of a celebrity sighting.
