A brave 13-year-old girl who was the sole survivor of a rock slide which killed her parents, sister and two cousins said today that she will never forget her father's bravery when he sacrificed his life to save her. 

Gracie Johnson suffered a broken leg but survived when 100 tons of boulders came loose from a mountain and tumbled onto a hiking trail near Buena Vista, Colorado on September 30.

Miss Johnson said on Thursday that she was doing 'really good' and spoke proudly of her dad Dwayne whom she credits with saving her life.

She told Today: 'I did cover myself, but I was just standing in the open. He did push me to a rock that was bigger than I was, and he just saved me.'

Finding the courage to carry on: Gracie Johnson, 13, pictured today, was the sole survivor of a rock slide in Colorado which killed her mom, dad, sister and two cousins

She added: 'I'm doing really well, and I'm healing a lot. It's a lot different. Nothing is going to be the same for me. I'm handling it really well. I know that I have to change a lot.'

Gracie's mother and father Dwayne and Dawna Johnson, ages 46 and 45, were killed, along with her 18-year-old sister Kiowa Raine Johnson and cousins Baigen Walker, 10, and Paris Walkup, 22, from Birch Tree, Missouri.

Her brother Dakota, 20, was not on the hike and was her only immediate family member to survive the tragedy. 

Gracie spoke to presenter Savannah Guthrie along with her aunt Dayna, uncle Daryle and cousin Tyler who have moved from their home to live with Gracie in her tight-knit small town of Buena Vista.

Dakota, 20, (seated) was not with the family at the time

Friends said 'everybody' in town knew the family. Dawna and Dwayne once owned a restaurant in town. Dakota was a star football player before he graduated last year

Gracie said she wanted to 
thank everyone in the town for how much they have come together to help 
her deal with the devastating loss.

Her uncle Daryle told Today that the kindness and support had been extended to them.

Mr Johnson said: 'You don't know how many times you hear, ''Anything we can do for you, just give us a call.''

'It's a great 
community. It's a little bit of a change going to a small town, but it 
is really nice.'

His wife Dayna added that her brother-in-law 'didn't know a stranger' and that Donna 'was one of the most beautiful souls'.

The Johnson family played a big part 
in town life. Dwayne was an assistant football coach at Buena Vista High
 School, as well as an electrician and landscaper.

Dawn coached track at the high school, was a photographer and a popular waitress at a restaurant in town.

'Everyone knows this family. 
Everyone who was involved in football knew Dwayne,' Brian Dengler, the 
pastor at Cornerstone Church, said at the time of the tragedy.

Trapped: Five hikers were killed after being buried under the 100 tons of rock which slid down a mountain in Colorado in September

'The whole family, they were gregarious. Very outgoing. Very active in the community. Kiowa just turned 18. Dwayne was so proud of his girl. Just an amazing, amazing family.'

The rock slide happened at Agnes Vaille Falls near Mount Princeton -
 130 miles southwest of Denver. The short mile-and-a-half trail is popular with families and is known as one of the easiest hikes around.

The Johnson family took advantage of a clear, beautiful day Monday - following days of rain and clouds previously - to take their visiting family members Baigen and Paris for a hike.

Chaffee County Sheriff's Deputy Nick 
Tolsma was among the first officials to respond to the scene of the 
collapse, where he discovered Gracie alive under a rock. 

'I heard a scream next to me. I saw a hand sticking out underneath the boulder,' Tolsma told ABC News. 'The
 true hero is her dad. She said her dad jumped on her to protect her at 
the last moment when the rocks were coming down. I think he saved her 
life.'

Geologists believe that the downpour of rain that the area received recently, combined with the onset of frost - which froze and thawed the ground, likely caused the massive rock slide - which loosened boulders the size of cars and let loose an estimate 100 tons of rubble.
