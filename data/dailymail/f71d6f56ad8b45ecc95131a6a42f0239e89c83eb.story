An investigation has been launched after an ambulance controller was pictured apparently asleep on the job.

A photograph by a colleague allegedly shows Kim Fullerton, a performance manager with North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), having a nap during a night shift.

It was leaked by a whistleblower who claimed that when it was taken Mrs Fullerton was supposed to be monitoring 999 calls on her computer. However, it is unclear whether the 51-year-old was on a work break and thus entitled to a nap, with the photo taken in jest.

Leaked
 by a whistleblower: Performance manager Kim Fullerton and ambulance 
despatcher Daniel Manning appeared in the image at the North West 
Ambulance Service office in Liverpool

Ambulance dispatcher Daniel Manning also appears smiling in the snap taken at Elm House, in Anfield, Liverpool, the control base where staff answer emergency calls for NWAS.

Bosses at NWAS confirmed they had launched an inquiry into the allegations.

The whistleblower told a local newspaper that Mrs Fullerton was supposed to be looking at emergency jobs on her screen when her eyes were shut.

Mr Manning should have been at his desk waiting to dispatch ambulances to respond to the 999 calls.

A spokesman for NWAS admitted a performance manager’s job is to monitor call activity, ensuring all 999 calls are answered and categorised, but dispatchers and call handlers do not always sit at their desks throughout their shifts.

They can get up and walk around, take breaks and speak to colleagues, she added. Last night, Mrs Fullerton declined to comment on the photograph when approached by the Daily Mail at her home in West Derby, Liverpool.

Michael Forrest, director of organisational development for NWAS, said: ‘The North West Ambulance Service takes any allegation about the conduct of its staff extremely seriously and has launched a full investigation into the circumstances in which this picture was taken.’

The allegation comes at a time when NWAS is under intense pressure following an unprecedented rise in the number of calls.

Red calls – those requiring help for seriously ill patients – were up 12.1 per cent in July compared with the previous year.

Rosie Cooper, Labour MP for Southport and Ormskirk, who last week claimed lives were being lost because staff are trying to cut corners and not dispatch ambulances unless absolutely necessary, said: ‘This picture raises serious questions for NWAS, especially in light of the news stories of poor performance recently.

‘NWAS need to investigate urgently and assure the public that, when they need an ambulance, the performance manager isn’t asleep and that they properly supervise their employees – after all, it’s precious public money and can’t be wasted.’

Despite the increased workload, NWAS is meeting strict Government targets that demand at least 75 per cent of calls for the most serious cases are dealt with within eight minutes.
