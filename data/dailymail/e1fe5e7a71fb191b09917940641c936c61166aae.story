Daredevil Nick Macomber stunned onlookers when he checked out of the Four Seasons in Denver by taking a jet pack off the hotel's 45th floor.

The hydrogen-and-nitrogen-powered jetpack then circled the building for 30 seconds as it made its way to safe landing back at its starting point on the hotel's roof.

The jet pack was created by Go Fast of Colorado , which has had a jet pack team since 2003.

The Independent reports that the stunt was a test flight for a future world record attempt off the tallest building in the southern hemisphere.

In 2012, Macomber carried the Olympic torch while flying past Leicester's National Space Centre and wearing a jet pack.

The machines are propelled by a blast of non-flammable hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen.

While seemingly futuristic, jet packs have captured headlines for decades.

In 1984, Bill Suitor performed arguably the most famous jet pack flight when he took off for the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Olympics in front roughly 100,000 spectators.

Macomber's jet pack was designed by Colorado company Go Fast which has had a jet pack team for more than a decade

More recently, Smithsonian Magazine's Future is Here Festival in May featured a jet pack flyer navigating Washington D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Building.

The world's 'first practical jet pack' was cleared by New Zealand aviation regulators in 2013 for manned test-flights.
