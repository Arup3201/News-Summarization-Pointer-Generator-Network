Having problems working up enthusiasm for a gym session? These photos could provide you with a bit of inspiration.

The images of nude, very buff men doing CrossFit (a tough mixture of weight-lifting, rope-climbing and tyre-flipping), were originally used by 
Danish gym Spartan Mentality as an April Fool's Day ad.

However, the gym soon found itself inundated with people turning up hoping 
to actually work out in the buff: naked CrossFit might sound uncomfortable but it appears there's a real market for it.

Spartan Mentality gives the gym-shy some real motivation to work out

Originally a spoof advert, the Danish gym soon found people actually turning up to work out nude

So overwhelming was the response that the owners of the Aarhus gym, Steffen Haldrup Andersen and Rune Jensen, decided to turn their prank into reality and offer real naked cross-fit classes each Sunday.

Speaking at the launch, Andersen said: ‘People are already so scantily-clad at Cross-Fit that
 we thought we might as well throw the rest away.’

And, as these photos reveal, CrossFit really is a good choice for those who want to tone up, with plenty of chiselled abs and bulging biceps on show.

Unfortunately for those who fancy trying their hand at the unusual exercise regime, a combination of intense media attention and several outraged reactions saw the class closed soon after it started.

Speaking to The Copenhagen Post, co-owner Rune Jensen explained: ‘It started out as an April Fool’s joke that got too much attention.

‘We then actually decided to start up the nude sessions, but in the end there was too much media focus on us. It all got a little too comical and we changed our minds. I have no idea how the story went viral.’

If your idea of the perfect partner is someone who manages to be both muscular and fond of getting naked, these photos could be prove the motivation you need to get to the gym

It could be described as 'the Fight Club' of workouts: a punishing regime of Olympic weight-lifting, rope-climbing and tyre-flipping, and spectacular displays of gymnastic strength and balance.

Devised 20 years ago by American gym coach Greg Glassman in California, cross-fit immediately proved popular with military, police and fire academy trainees.

Later, it was adopted by Hollywood personal trainers looking for a quick way to help A-list actors get into shape among them, Brad Pitt, Magic Mike star Channing Tatum and Jason Statham.

'It now has a massive following and is extremely popular,' explains Virgin Active group exercise manager Gillian Reeves.

'It's part of a trend for group activity involving hard-core exercise - boot camps started it and there are now mass endurance events like Tough Mudder.'

A typical class includes a warm-up, a skill session, where you learn about a certain element such as lifting or a movement, and ends with the 'Workout of the Day', which combines and repeats all movements.

However, Gillian warns that it is not suitable for all. 'Some moves are very difficult, so it's great for people wanting to push themselves but doesn't suit everyone - and too much too soon can cause injury.'
