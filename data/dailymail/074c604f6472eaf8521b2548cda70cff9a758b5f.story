A three-day-old girl has become the latest victim of Typhoon Haiyan because the hospital she was in had no electricity.

The parents of baby Althea Mustacia were forced to keep up a day and night routine of pumping air into her lungs by hand when she was born with newborn asphyxia.

Despite their round-the-clock efforts, the little girl died three days later on the first floor of the Talcoban hospital chapel, which now serves as the neonatal unit.

Latest victim: The mother of Althea Mustacisa is pictured pumping oxygen into the three-day-old's lungs in an attempt to keep her alive

Tragedy: Despite their efforts, three-day-old Althea died on the floor of a Catholic chapel inside the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban

Power cut: Althea, pictured with her parents standing over her, was born five days after the typhoon. She had asphyxia - where a baby doesn't breathe in the first minute following birth. Doctors believe she could have been saved if their incubators had been working

Newborn asphyxia is a condition where a baby does not start breathing in the minute following birth, and is the most common cause of infant mortality in the Philippines.

The Tacloban medical centre has been badly damaged by the storm. It is partly flooded, walls have collapsed, part of the roof has fallen in, and there is no power.

The little girl was born five days after the strongest storm ever to make landfall ripped through the city.

The neonatal unit in Tacloban hospital (pictured) has had to be moved into the chapel after the storm flooded parts of the centre, knocking down walls and causing part of the roof to cave in

Althea's parents spent three days pumping air into her lungs by hand, but their efforts were not enough to save her. Doctors have said that if the incubators were working she could have lived (file picture)

Her 18-year-old mother shared shifts working a hand air pump with the girl's father in an effort to keep her alive.

However she eventually died and doctors have said that if the hospital's incubators were working, she could have been saved.

Althea was one of the 24 babies in the hospital’s neonatal ward, which had to be moved from the flooded ground floor to a chapel one floor above.

The chapel’s 28 pews have been turned into makeshift beds for mothers, some of whom are so weak themselves that they lie with IV drips in their arms.

While the city of Tacloban is the hardest hit, other towns, such as Palo, on Leyte island province, have also been badly affected and left without aid as roads have been left strewn with debris

According to the national disaster relief agency, nearly 4 million people have been displaced by the storm

Today the British destroyer HMS Daring arrived in Cebu, a port near to Tacloban, to start providing emergency aid.

The ship is carrying 500 shelter kits, 10 tonnes of high energy biscuits and will use its water filers to fill 1,900 tankers with clean drinking water.

It joins a team of 12 British doctors already helping the survivors, as donations to the UK's crisis appeal have topped £33million, with another £30million being pledged by the government.

Some victims have had to wait for days to be rescued by aircraft, such as this US C-130 military cargo plane, before being taken to Manila, capital of the Philippines

Any building still standing is being used to treat survivors like Edgardo Palma, who is seen here inside a school in Palo, Leyte island province
