Casey Anthony’s lawyers tried to persuade the 25-year-old to accept a plea deal towards the end of her murder trial, a retired prosecutor from the case has revealed in an explosive new book.

Jeff Ashton said that while the Florida mother ‘may have deserved’ the death penalty if she had been convicted of killing her two-year-old daughter, he didn’t believe a jury would ever have agreed to the sentence.

Writing in Imperfect Justice: Prosecuting Casey Anthony, he said he would have been pleased if the prosecution team had left the punishment off the table.

He also branded Miss Anthony’s attorney ‘smarmy’ and claimed he was genuinely careless with facts and encouraged his client to be uncooperative with detectives during the search for her daughter.

Mr Ashton said: ‘Personally, I think I would have been happier if the death penalty had not been reintroduced into the case, even though I think on some level I think Casey may have deserved it. Simply put, I just didn’t think the jury would go there.’

Anthony’s refusal to accept a deal paid off as jurors acquitted her in July over the killing of her daughter, Caylee.

She was released from prison, although she is in hiding somewhere in Florida, serving probation for an unrelated check fraud case.

Mr Ashton’s book is the first account written by one of the key players in the trial that captured the attention of the nation last summer. He retired soon after the trial ended.

In it, he takes direct aim at Anthony’s defense attorneys, specifically Jose Baez, whom he says he genuinely dislikes.

‘There is an unearned air of arrogance about the man that is incredibly frustrating to witness,’ Ashton writes. ‘The word I used in describing Jose is smarmy: somebody who is slick, underhanded and doesn’t shoot straight.’

Mr Baez said in a statement that Ashton’s characterisations were false.

He said: ‘Having read several of the comments Mr Ashton makes in his new book, I am both surprised and somewhat disappointed he has chosen to attack me on a personal level.’

Mr Ashton also writes an unflattering view of jurors. He wrote they seemed to give a lot of thought and discussion about which movies they wanted to watch or which restaurants to go to while they were sequestered.

Yet no juror asked a single question about the evidence during deliberation.

‘From the moment our jury had been fielded ... we’d had concerns over their apparent absence of strong opinions as well as over the amount of effort they seemed willing to expend on this,’ Ashton writes. ‘In retrospect, I think those concerns were justified.’

Three jurors gave television interviews immediately after the verdict, but they have since refused to talk to reporters about the case.

The book, for the first time, also discloses the results of two psychological evaluations taken of Anthony.

Two defense psychologists who did the evaluations never testified. But Miss Anthony told the psychologists that she was sexually abused by her father, Ashton wrote.

As part of their defense, Miss Anthony’s attorneys said Caylee drowned in the family swimming pool, and that her father, a former police officer, helped cover it up.

Miss Anthony’s partying and shopping during the month before her daughter was reported missing was caused in part by her father’s sexual abuse, according to the defense theory.

Her father, George Anthony, repeatedly denied those claims in court and afterward.

One psychologist expressed 
apprehension about his evaluation being used to support that defense 
theory, Ashton writes, especially since Miss Anthony had scored in a 
normal range on a test designed to discover mental disorders.

The
other psychologist gave Anthony a battery of tests to diagnose stress 
from trauma such as sexual molestation. The tests didn’t support the 
theory that she had been molested, Ashton writes.

A
few weeks before trial, prosecutors met with Mr Anthony, and his wife, 
Cindy, to give them a heads-up about the molestation accusations that 
the defense planned to use at trial.

‘George
looked like he had been crying, like someone had just killed Caylee all
over again,’ Ashton writes. ‘He was just devastated.’

More
than six months after she disappeared, a meter reader found Caylee’s 
remains in a swampy, wooded area near where she lived with her mother 
and grandparents.

Ashton said in the book that law 
enforcement and volunteers never examined that area until Roy Kronk 
reported seeing the remains there in December 2008.

He writes: ‘In the end, Murphy’s Law prevailed: everyone assumed that someone else had searched there, but in fact no one actually had.

‘Everyone, including law enforcement, assumed that the most obvious place had to have been combed and given the all clear — which just proves the adage about what happens when you assume.

'Everybody ends up looking like and ass and a nation spent an extra four months searching around the country for a lost little girl who was a quarter mile from home.’

A spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, the lead agency investigating Caylee’s disappearance and death, said Monday that pinpointing a place to search for the toddler was challenging.

‘Mr. Ashton, as part of the prosecution team, was well aware of the difficulties in establishing a starting point,’ Capt. Angelo Nieves said. ‘

Casey Anthony told numerous lies to law enforcement throughout the investigation concerning her daughter’s whereabouts.’
