A driver has released terrifying footage of the moment his car careered off the edge of a cliff and flipped through the air.

The man, whose identity is not known, was reportedly on a canyon cruise in Arizona last year when he lost control of the car around a bend.

He posted the video on YouTube under the name CARBAHnM3 Production alongside a statement reading: 'Tribute video of my old M3 that died doing what it was engineered and built to do.'

Death-defying: A driver has released terrifying footage of the moment his car careered off the edge of a cliff and flipped through the air

Verge: The man, whose identity is not known, was reportedly on a canyon cruise in Arizona when he lost control of the car around a bend in November last year

The death-defying moment was filmed by a camera mounted on the BMW.

It shows the man driving at a speed along a mountain top road as the sun sets in the sky. 

His black car then veers to the left and speeds off the edge of the vertical drop.

The driver can be seen spinning through the air before landing at speed at the bottom of the canyon.

Miraculously the driver lived to tell the tale - and recover the camera from his car.

The driver's friend posted the video on a car forum last year and wrote: 'When my other friends climbed down to check on him and the passenger, expecting the worst, they came upon two guys with a couple scratches, nothing more, nothing less.'

His friend posted the video on a car forum last year and wrote: 'On
Thanksgiving day I woke up to a call no one wants to get, "Someone from
the crew just drove off a cliff. We don't know who it is yet. I'll keep
you updated".

My heart ****ing dropped, from what I was hearing I thought one of my good friends just died.

'To my and everyone's relief, when my 
other friends climbed down to check on him and the passenger, expecting 
the worst, they came upon two guys with a couple scratches, nothing 
more, nothing less.'
