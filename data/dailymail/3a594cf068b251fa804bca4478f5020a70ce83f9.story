Four hikers and a young, unconscious girl were saved from deadly rising tides after they formed a human chain and were airlifted to safety.

The walkers were on the coast by Fogarty Creek state park, Oregon, on Saturday when the tide started drawing in, trapping them off-shore.

There were initially eight people in the group - but three jumped into the freezing water and managed to swim to shore, while the others waited for rescue.

Rescue: The hikers gathered on a rock away from the waves after stumbling there in a human chain. One of the walkers (circled) waits for an airlift

Video shot from the shore shows the remaining walkers stumbling through the waves - clinging to one another for safety.

They appear to be carrying one of their number, who is shorter than the other walkers. The bystander, who passed the footage to the KATU news channel, said she was a girl and had passed out.

They fled away from the shore onto higher ground due to the oncoming waves. They eventually scrambled up onto a rocky outcrop, where they could wait for rescue.

To safety: After linking arms to survive the high swell pulling at their bodies, the walkers were lifted away by the Coast Guard. One girl, who had passed out during the struggle with the sea, was taken to hospital

Rough weather: The helicopter rescue might not have been possible were the craft stationed further away, the local fire department chief warned

The group was saved when a Coast Guard helicopter swooped in. Each of them was pictured being airlifted away from the rocks.

One of the rescued walkers was flown to hospital. The others seemed to be unharmed.

The rescue was carried out by a Coast Guard helicopter from the nearby Newport station - which is controversially due to close at the end of November, moving the helicopter much further away.

Depoe Bay Fire Chief Joshua L. Williams suggested the rescue could have gone very differently without the nearby chopper.

He said: 'There were five frightened, cold, wet people stranded on those rocks, I needed a helo here in 10 minutes, not an hour.

 'We depend on the USCG helo. The surf is too dangerous and too cold for firefighters to enter the water and time is not a luxury you have when performing rescues.
