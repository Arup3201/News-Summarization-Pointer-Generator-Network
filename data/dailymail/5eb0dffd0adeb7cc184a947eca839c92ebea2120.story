The earliest images of the battlefield of Waterloo - depicting the naked bodies of fallen soldiers - have gone on display after they were discovered in a private collection. 

The watercolour paintings are believed to have been painted by an Irish man, one of many civilians to flock to Belgium to witness the aftermath of the battle, and have gone on show at the British Museum.

They feature the naked bodies of defeated troops which remained on the battlefields for five days following the bloody June 18, 1815, conflict, depicted as eerie white outlines on a vast panoramic brown landscape.

They are signed T. Stoney, who curators believe was Thomas Stoney, said by historians to have been one of the first civilians to ride from Louvain to sketch the aftermath of the battle at Waterloo, La Haye Sainte and Quatre Bras in watercolour

The works - believed to have been created on June 20 or 21 1815 - depict La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont, the most famous sites of the battle, and views of the buildings at Quatre Bras.

They were kept in an album of paintings of scenes from around Ireland and Northern Europe and passed from the family to a private collection.

The works form part of an exhibition entitled Bonaparte and the British: Prints and Propaganda in the Age of Napoleon. They offer a poignant contrast to the more traditional accounts of the battle, which show the battle in full force.  

Sheila O'Connell, co-curator of the exhibition, told the Telegraph that experts knew of 'absolutely nothing earlier' to suggest that there were not the first images of the battlefield.

The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe. The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'

Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses

The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time.

France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington.

The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am.

The 11 watercolours of the battlefield of Waterloo were taken from a private collection, including three long panoramas

The works are on public show for the first time. These are the earliest known studies of the battlefield made only two or three days after the fighting concluded

The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army.

This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender.
