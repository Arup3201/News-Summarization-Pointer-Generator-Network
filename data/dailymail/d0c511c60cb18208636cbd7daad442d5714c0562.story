The Royal family is the hardest working in Europe, with Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth topping a list of British and Scandinavian monarchs.

An investigation into the number of working days in European royal houses found that the 65-year-old Prince of Wales is the hardest grafter with 189 working days, followed by the Queen with 181 days and the King of Sweden coming in third.

Despite turning 92 this year, Prince Philip did more work this year than a majority of the younger royals, clocking up an impressive 120 working days.

Like mother, like son: Prince Charles was the hardest worker among the royals families investigated with 189 days completed in 2013, followed by the Queen, who worked 181 days

The 92-year-old worked more days than both Crown Prince Haakon of Norway, aged 40, who worked 114 days and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, 45, who managed a mere three months.

The list has been compiled by Danish tabloid Ekstrabladet, based on the official calendars of members of the Scandinavian and British royal families between January 1 and December 16 this year.

The British Royal family came out looking the best, with its older members all in the top ten - including Charles wife Camilla sharing the fifth spot with the King of Norway and the Queen of Denmark at with 124 working days.

In terms of heir apparents, Prince Charles is way ahead of both Haakon of Norway and Frederik of Denmark as well as Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria, aged 36, who only worked 89 days this year.

The low number of 'working days' by Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, is a natural result of the Prince's job in the miliraty service, Kate's pregnancy and their time off to care for Prince George.

Age is just a number: Prince Philip, 92, clocked up more working days than a majority of younger members of royal houses in Scandinavia and Britain

Others with less of an excuse are the Danish royals who were subjected to heavy criticism by Ekstrabladet as its heir apparent, Crown Prince Frederik, only managed 90 days of work compared to Prince Charles 189.

'I donâ€™t know of any other professions which is measured purely in visits and where you completely disregard days in the office. Being royal cannot be compared to a 9-5 job,' said Lene Balleby, chief of communication at the Danish court, told Ekstrabladet.

'The Swedish Royal family work in the office where both internal meetings and audiences both with individuals and organisations,' Ulrika NÃ¤sholm, royal secretary of information at the Swedish court, told Â­Aftonbladet.

'The official calendar is a selection of their tasks'

Representatives for both the Swedish and Danish Royal Houses reject the survey.
