The man designing Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup yacht says: ‘To be honest, I know nothing about boats. Boats have never been a passion of mine.’ Nor can he swim.

So speaks Adrian Newey, a Picasso with a 4H pencil, who can claim to be the finest motor racing designer of his generation.

He is now splitting his time 50-50 between Red Bull’s Formula One programme and their Advanced Technologies project - helping Ainslie’s team for the 2017 Cup and also designing a road car.

Newey believes engine suppliers Renault are letting Red Bull down.

‘It’s frustrating that we’ve got an engine which is a long way behind with no obvious light at the end of the tunnel and all sorts of failings,’ he said before Sunday's Australian Grand Prix.

‘We keep trying to offer to get involved. It’s one thing where you’re not competitive but you can see your way out of it. It’s another when you’re not competitive and your partner doesn’t seem to be willing to deal with you.’

Problems persisted into this weekend. Daniel Ricciardo’s car required a new engine - one of four allowed for the 20-round season. He qualified seventh and his team-mate Daniil Kvyat 13th for a race due to start without Manor, the team that is trying to re-form itself from the ashes of Marussia.

Mercedes took pole with Lewis Hamilton.

Newey, 56, can take his mind off the track with Ainslie’s venture, where he will work with former McLaren colleague Martin Whitmarsh, who was last week named chief executive of the America’s Cup team.
