Britain's 'luckiest' mother has won more than £30,000 worth of prizes in just two years - all by entering online and TV competitions.

Katy Spence, 34, from Boston, Lincs. has been able to kit out her entire home with prizes she has amassed by entering up to 100 competitions each day.

She has scooped free iPads, perfume, a digital camera, DVD player, computer games, chocolate, dozens of toiletries and cleaning products.

Katy, who runs a sign-making business, has even bagged herself five-star holidays to America, Greece and Spain - and £11,500 in cash prizes.

And the mother-of-two has been able to surprise friends and family with prizes she has scooped from online competitions. 

Last year she treated husband Mark, 35, to a VIP tour of the Formula 1 Red Bull head office and factory worth £400.

Her biggest prize was £8,500 she scooped after entering an online competition on Dickinson's Real Deal TV show.

Since she started entering online competitions in 2012 Katy has won an incredible 267 prizes.

Despite her giant prize haul she refuses to play the lottery, saying the chances of winning are too small.

Katy said: 'I met a woman online back in January 2012 and she introduced me to comping.

'I still remember the first prize I won, which was £200 worth of Marc Jacobs perfume. 

'It just appeared on my doorstep one morning out of nowhere, with no note, or message, or letter or anything. I was delighted.'

'I was hooked after that and every day I scour the net for competitions. I must enter at least 100 every day.

'Some only take me a few minutes to enter while others can take a few days, I love the thrill they give me and the prizes can be fantastic.

'If I need something for the house or a holiday the first thing I do is look for competitions. I don't do the lottery because it's too random. The chances of winning are too small.

'The prizes I do win vary, anything from holidays to meals out and perfume to money. There is something from everyone in the family. 

'I have given my friends and family some amazing experiences through prizes.

'This year, I won a dining experience for ten when a chef came to my home and cooked us all a meal.

'That was lovely. It was a Nurofen competition I entered on Christmas Day on Facebook.

'I love creative competitions. My children get involved in those and we get quite a lot of success out of those. 

'I do a bit of everything though, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email competitions, even postcard competitions. 

'My best year has been 2013. I won prizes to the total value of about £18,800.

'I am just so grateful for all the lovely things I win and often am able to give to my loved ones.'

Now the 'comping' addict, who is married to husband Mark and has two boys with him, Leo, eight, and four-year-old Cole, enjoys entering competitions with the whole family. 

She added: 'The children are actually starting competitions. They will pause the TV if they see the word 'win' on the screen now and rush to tell me.

'It is becoming something we like to do as a family, especially with the creative competitions.

Sometimes you have to make a video or something for those and we like that.'
