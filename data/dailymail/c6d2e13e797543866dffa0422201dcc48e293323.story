Everton need to stop trying to play like Barcelona and return to what they had under David Moyes, according to Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness.

The Toffee's defensive frailties were once again exposed during their 3-2 defeat by Newcastle on Sunday - meaning only QPR have conceded more goals than Roberto Martinez's side this season.

Speaking after the game, Souness said: 'Everton are flattering to deceive at the moment.

Roberto Martinez needs to change his style to arrest Everton's slump, says Graeme Souness

The Sky presenter claims Everton need to get back to playing David Moyes' direct style of football

'The second goal typifies Everton at the moment, they are trying to play their way out of trouble when there's nothing wrong with putting your foot through it occasionally.

'They're trying to basically play like Barcelona at their best, but there's very few teams out there that can keep the ball when teams come after them big style.

'It's not all pass-pass-pass, sometime you have to mix it up at times.'

The former Liverpool midfielder even went as far as to say that Martinez should consider sacrificing his expansive style in favour of the more direct approach that identified the club under previous manager David Moyes.

'You have to get back to what David Moyes had. They were a little bit more in your face, more direct and they mixed it up a little bit. 

'Now, they are so predictable to play against and that's why they're conceding so many goals as well.'

Fellow pundit Gary Neville agreed that Martinez's philosophy of playing the ball out from the back is contributing to their woeful defensive record this season.

'Everton were beaten in every single department and the goals that they conceded were a result of play that Roberto Martinez tries to promote. 

'Obviously playing out from the back, which is fine - but they have overplayed and it has cost them. 

'But if that is the way that you promote to play then you have to lie and die by that.

However, the Spanish manager was defiant that he would persevere with the same tactics that led Everton to a praiseworthy fifth placed finish last season.

Speaking to reporters, he said: 'As a team we need to stick with our principles, the doubts that people try to bring in makes you a stronger team. 

We showed last season what we could do, we haven't lost that talent, if anything we've increased it.'
