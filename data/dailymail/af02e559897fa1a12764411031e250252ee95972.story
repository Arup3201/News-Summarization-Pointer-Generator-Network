Five special edition Ferraris from the past 30 years are being auctioned in a huge £14million sale of the Italian brand.

The Enzo, F50, F40, 288 GTO and the 599XX - so high performance it is not allowed to be driven on the road - are among 16 Ferraris for sale.

Launched in 1985, the 288 GTO is one of the fastest appreciating cars built by the marque.

It is capable of 0-60mph in less than five seconds and has a top speed of 185mph.

Only 399 Enzos - which were released in 2002 - exist. The model pictured above is expected to fetch £750,000

The Ferrari F50, pictured, is expected to sell for £410,000 at the auction in Italy on May 25

The Ferrari F40 was the world's fastest car when it went on sale in 1987. The one above is valued at £360,000

RM Auctions estimates it will sell for around £815,000 at the event at Lake Como, Italy.

The Ferrari F40 was the world's fastest car when it went on sale in 1987 and was the first production car to hit 200mph.

The 1989 model on offer is expected to fetch £360,000.

The F50, from 1997, is worth around £410,000 and the Enzo is expected to fetch £750,000 on May 25.

The final special edition Ferrari on offer is the 2010 599XX, a track-only vehicle with 720bhp and a price-tag of around £940,000.

The 375MM is predicted to account for a third of the total takings from the sale of 16 Ferraris

The 375MM Berlinetta, pictured, is estimated to be worth around £5million

The 1953 375MM, above, is expected to sell for more than the top five special edition cars combined

But the total price for the 'full house' of special edition Ferraris is likely to be less than the figure paid for a Ferrari 375MM Berlinetta, which is also being sold.

RM Auctions isn't giving a list price for the classic 1953 model, but it is thought to be in the region of £5million.

The auction will take place during the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este weekend, a competition for classic and vintage cars established in 1929.

A total of 40 cars will be sold, including  models from Bugatti, Bentley and Mercedes.

Max Girardo, managing director of RM Auctions, said: ‘This sale not only features some of the best cars from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, but we are delighted to have brought together the ultimate collection of Ferrari's landmark supercars of the last 30 years.

‘It is very rare indeed to have such fantastic, low mileage, well documented, and Ferrari-certified examples of these models together in one sale.’
