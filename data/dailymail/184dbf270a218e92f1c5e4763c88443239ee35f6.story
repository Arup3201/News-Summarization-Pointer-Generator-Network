Manchester City have introduced strobe glasses and SPARQ training as they step up their preparations for the new season.

Not happy with the signings of Fernando, Willy Caballero and the imminent arrival of Eliaquim Mangala, the Premier League champions have bought the hi-tech specs into their training camp in order to give their stars even more of an edge over opponents.

The glasses heighten the concentration of athletes as they try to execute skills and are used across a variety of sports. The wearer must focus on what they're doing while the light gets lighter, darker and flashes.Â

And the SPARQ training sees players undergo a number of assessments which give an indication of their overall fitness and ability and what can be improved upon.

Players including Javi Garcia, Alvaro Negredo and Micah Richards were spotted wearing them at City's St Andrews training camp in Scotland.

City need the edge if their lacklustre performance against Dundee at the weekend was anything to go by. A side including the likes of Samir Nasri, Fernando, Aleksandar Kolarov, Negredo and Stevan Jovetic went down 2-0 agaisnt the Scottish side.
