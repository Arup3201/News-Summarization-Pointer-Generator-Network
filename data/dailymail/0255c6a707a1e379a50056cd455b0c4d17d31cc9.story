A 36-year-old food service worker at a middle school has been charged with raping a juvenile.

Janelle Foley was arraigned on Thursday in Quincy District Court on four counts of statutory rape following her arrest at her home on Wednesday night.

It is alleged that Foley had sexual relations with a 15-year-old boy during the winter vacation who was described in court as a friend's son. It is not clear if the alleged victim is also a student at the middle school in Weymouth, Massachusetts.
