State jobs: Northern Ireland has the highest percentage of workers employed in the public sector (27.7 per cent) compared to just 16.6 per cent in the South East

Fewer than one in five people now work in the public sector, new figures show every part of the UK becomes less reliant on state jobs.

In September there were 5.7million people working in the public sector, 19.4 per cent of all those in work.

The figure is down from almost 6.2million or 22 per cent in 2009, as spending cuts have seen a massive reduction in jobs in government, councils, education, the armed forces and the health service.

The proportion of people employed by the state varies markedly across the country.

Northern Ireland is most dominated by taxpayer-funded jobs, with 27.7 per cent of workers on the public payroll.

By comparison in the South East just 16.6 per cent of people work in the public sector.

The ONS said: ‘Total public sector employment is estimated to have risen in all regions during 2008 and 2009 before then falling to below 2008 levels by September 2012.’

The number of people employed by 
councils has fallen across the country since 2008, except in Northern 
Ireland which has seen a small increase.

The National Health Service employs 1.55 million people nationwide, down four per cent from a peak of 1.6million in 2009.

Less reliant: The proportion of people employed by the state has fallen across all regions since 2008

The education sector accounts for 1.5 million staff while public administration employs 1.1 million.

Most regions now have more people working in the private sector than in March 2008.

David Cameron has repeatedly promise a ‘private-sector led’ recovery, and boasted that the coalition has created up to 1million jobs.

From September 2008 to September 2012,
the number of people employed by the public sector fell by five per 
cent from 6million to 5.7million.

Over the same period, private sector employment rose by two per cent to 23.9million.

Part
of the fall in the number of people employed in the public sector can 
be explained by some sixth form and further education colleges being 
reclassified from the public to the private sector.

Public spending cuts have seen reductions in the numbers on the state payroll, but the private sector has grown

But the ONS said that even excluding this reclassification, the number of people employed in the public sector fell by 128,000 between September 2011 and September 2012.

The ONS said: Across the UK the percentage of people employed in the public sector varies. Northern Ireland (27.7%) and Wales (25.7%) both had more than a quarter of their workforce employed in the public sector.

'Within England, the South East (16.9%), East (16.7%) and London (16.9%) had the lowest percentage of their workforces employed in the public sector.

'However across the UK, London had the highest number of people employed in the public sector at 741,000 but it has a larger population than other areas of the UK.'
