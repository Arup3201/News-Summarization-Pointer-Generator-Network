Catherine De La Rosa, 54, was just 5ft tall but weighed 23st

Catherine
 De La Rosa was nervous about having weight-loss surgery, but having 
been assured by doctors that it was straightforward and safe, she 
decided to give it a try.

The 54-year-old grandmother was just 5ft 
tall but weighed 23st, giving her a body mass index (BMI) of 52, making 
her 'super-obese'.

She had tried to lose weight with various diets 
but nothing worked long term. Her size restricted her movement and made 
her deeply depressed.

Doctors at Leicester Royal Infirmary were 
encouraging, however, explaining that inserting a gastric balloon would 
be the answer. The balloon would partly fill her stomach, making her 
feel fuller quicker, restricting her desire and ability to eat.

Catherine was convinced, says her son Keiron, that finally this might help her lead a normal, healthy life.

She had the surgery in June 2012. Four  days later she was dead, having suffered traumatic blood poisoning.

At
 an inquest last September, a Leicester City coroner heard that the 
balloon had perforated her stomach, allowing toxic fluids to leak into 
her bloodstream.

Mrs De La Rosa's case is the latest in a series of 
fatalities and injuries following NHS weight-loss surgery that have 
recently come to light. The toll includes two deaths following gastric 
bypass surgery in 2011 and 2012 at the Whittington Hospital, London, 
where a surgeon has been suspended pending the results of an 
investigation.

According to the NHS Information Centre, demand for 
weight-loss operations is rising rapidly. In 2006, there were 858 
procedures, rising tenfold to 8,794 in 2011.

To be eligible for 
surgery on the NHS, people must have a BMI over 40, or a BMI between 35 
and 40 but also suffer one or more obesity-related diseases, such as 
diabetes. Imperial College London estimated last year that as many as 
two million people in England are eligible for the surgery.

And NHS 
hospitals are gearing up to cope. For example, earlier this year the 
University Hospital of North Staffordshire announced plans to double the
 number of weight-loss operations and appointed a third obesity surgeon 
to keep pace with what it calls 'the flood of morbidly-obese patients' 
requiring surgery.

But there are concerns that patients aren't being told the whole story about the risks of such surgery.

Furthermore,
 there is no precise record of how many problems have occurred with 
obesity operations, nor how many 'revision' surgical procedures are 
being performed to correct weight-loss operations that went wrong.

This
 is even though revision surgery is known to be the riskiest of all such
 ops because it involves the highly intricate task of repairing previous
 surgery.

She had a BMI of 52, making her 'super-obese', but hadn't managed to lose weight with various diets

Kieron, 32, recalls how his mother became 'frustrated and 
depressed' that her attempts to lose weight failed. With her size at 
risk of damaging her health, doctors said surgery was the only way 
forward.

Catherine, who lived in Gibraltar, had the surgery 
performed in the UK under reciprocal health arrangements. 'Before the 
op, we went to Leicester to speak to the doctors about it,' says Kieron.

'The surgeon said there would not be any problems so long as she kept 
trying to diet and thus kept her weight stable.'

Catherine's daughter Stacey, 22, was with her mother at the hospital for the operation. 

'Afterwards,
 my sister rang to say that the doctors felt everything had gone well,' 
says Kieron. 'The next day, though, she rang again to say that Mum was 
complaining of pain and had begun to vomit - though the doctors had 
reassured her that this was a normal reaction.

'I was worried. She was never one to complain, so if Mum was complaining about pain, then she'd really be in pain.'

The number of years since the first bariatric surgery was performed

The
 following day the vomiting got worse. The next morning the family was 
told she'd be sent for a scan - but she died later that day.

'The doctors said something had gone wrong and that Mum had developed blood poisoning and had gone into cardiac arrest.'

Figures
 from the National Bariatric Surgery Registry suggest serious 
complications occur in only 2.6 per cent of cases. Three 'post-operative
 in-hospital' deaths occurred in Britain in 2013 as a result of 
weight-loss surgery, according to the registry, to which weight-loss 
surgeons submit their own results voluntarily.

But an authoritative 
British study in 2012 put the risks much higher. It found that one in 
ten of these operations results in significant problems, and that at 
least 29 deaths had occurred over a three-year period.

The inquiry by
 the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death 
(NCEPOD) found that one-third of patients had inadequate post-surgical 
care and monitoring.

Surgeons contributing to the National Bariatric 
Surgery Registry admit there is no good data to show how many ops have 
to be done again because the patient has become very ill. These revision
 operations carry the highest risk of death and long-term sickness.

Bertie
 Lee, who led the NCEPOD report and works as a malpractice lawyer, 
defending hospitals, warns: 'I have seen too many cases of doctors being
 caught out by the significant surgical challenges posed by patients 
with obesity.'

Often, he says, the difficulties are worsened by 
'lack of thoughtful pre-operative assessment and  the failure to do 
careful post-operative follow-up'.

Follow-up needs to be long-term. 
The report's findings show that many deaths related to bariatric surgery
 can occur three or more years after the operation.

Her son Kieron, 32, recalls how she became 'frustrated and depressed' that her attempts to slim failed

Two of the deaths
 following gastric surgery involved the Whittington Hospital, which is 
still conducting a long-running investigation involving the deaths of at
 least two women. In December 2012, it suspended a surgeon following the
 death of Jane White, a mother-of-three.

Mrs White, 39, from Romford,
 Essex, died following weight-loss surgery in September 2012. An inquest
 in June last year heard she died of 'multiple organ dysfunction due to 
complications', little over a week after her gastric bypass operation. 
Mrs White developed stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhoea two days after 
being discharged from hospital. A revision operation to discover and 
remedy the causes of her problems days later was 'inadequately 
performed', the coroner said.

In 2011, an inquest heard how Kim 
Blake, 33, a mother-of-one from North London, died from malnutrition 
caused by complications following gastric bypass surgery at the same 
hospital.

Ms Blake, who weighed 20st, had the initial operation in 
January 2010. It passed without complications but she could not keep any
 food down afterwards. Her weight plunged to 10st in ten months.

She died in December 2010, before an operation to reverse the procedure could be done.

So
 are these just exceptional cases? The fact is that many NHS hospitals 
are unprepared for dealing with weight-loss operations that go wrong.

Last
 January, researchers from King's College Hospital, London, warned in 
the respected World Journal of Emergency Surgery: 'Currently, there are 
no comprehensive guidelines for managing acute [emergency] cases of 
bariatric surgery.

'The on-call general surgical and 
anaesthetic/critical care teams are increasingly facing such clinical 
scenarios with no standard plan of management.'

New guidelines are 
being put in place for 'driving up standards' on follow-up care and 
monitoring after weight-loss surgery, according to Richard Welbourn, the
 president of the weight-loss surgeons' professional organisation, the 
British Obesity & Metabolic Surgery Society.

For Keiron De La 
Rosa, his mission continues to find out exactly what went wrong with his
 mother's care. 'I'm still struggling to come to terms with the fact 
that she is gone,' he says. 'I need answers about whether the hospital 
staff really did everything in their power to help Mum after the 
surgery.'

He has instructed solicitors Irwin Mitchell to press 
managers at the Leicester Royal Infirmary to give a full and open 
explanation of what went wrong.

John Jameson, the clinical director for surgery at Leicester's hospitals, says changes have been made since her death.

'Mrs
 De La Rosa suffered a rare but very serious complication of her 
surgery. We have carried out an investigation into her care and it found
 that staff failed to act quickly enough when she showed signs of 
deterioration.'

Clearly, much more needs to be done to create proper safety nets for people whose weight-loss surgery goes wrong.

As
 Tam Fry, a spokesman for the British Obesity Foundation, says: 'There 
is a false allure in weight-loss surgery as an "easy" answer.

'But 
weight-loss surgery is also a totally false economy when misused. People
 who imagine that it involves just a simple operation live in cloud 
cuckoo-land.'
