A mother is demanding answers after her son was rushed to hospital for drinking a Dairy Queen vanilla milkshake that had been contaminated with a chemical cleaning product.

Lisa Chase and her son Riley both suffered a burning sensation in their mouths after drinking the shake, which they bought from a drive-thru at a Dairy Queen in Thornton, Colorado on Thursday.

After taking a sip, seven-year-old Riley told his mother it didn't taste right.

'Something was bubbling on my tongue,' he told ABC News.

Fears: Lisa Chase and her son Riley both sipped the Dairy Queen milkshake that had been contaminated by a chemical cleaning product and experienced a burning sensation. Riley was treated at hospital

When Chase tasted the boy's drink herself, she immediately felt it too. 

'It was just like you were drinking a very strong cleanser,' she said. 'You could feel it go all the way into your stomach - it just burned all the way down.'

She immediately headed back to the store to complain, where employees were not helpful, she told 9 News.

But after returning home, she called the store and a manager admitted there had been a mix-up. 

Concerns: Mrs Chase became emotional as she said the restaurant had to be held accountable

On the mend: Riley said he felt like something was bubbling on his tongue after sipping the vanilla milkshake

The store's owner told 9 News that the vanilla syrup bottle had been left in a sink by a staff member who had poured a chemical cleaner inside. 

Another employee picked up the bottle thinking it was clean and refilled it with vanilla syrup. 

The container showed traces of a floor cleaner and de-greaser concentrate. This contains sodium hydroxide that can cause burns, vomiting and shock when ingested, MyFox8 reported.

Both of the workers have been written up and the store owner has contacted poison control and  the health department. A regional manager also contacted Chase on Friday to update her.

The franchise owner is now urging other customers to come forward if they believe they consumed a contaminated vanilla milkshake.

Scene: It emerged that an employee at the Colorado DQ had put cleaning product in the container and left it in the sink - before another worker, who thought it was clean, picked it up and put more vanilla flavor inside

At least two other customers ordered vanilla milkshakes and had to be treated at hospital, ABC News reported. 

Chase said Riley was feeling better after his hospital visit - but worries that it could have been much worse.

'They need to be held accountable for what they’re doing,' she said through tears. 'It could have cost people their lives.'

The incident comes just two weeks after a grandmother was rushed to hospital in critical condition when she consumed lye that had accidentally been put in her ice tea at a BBQ restaurant.

Victim: The incident came two weeks after Jan Harding, pictured with her husband Jim, suffered burns after drinking sweet tea that had accidentally been mixed with lye at a BBQ restaurant in Utah

On August 10, 67-year-old Jan Harding drank a single sip of the tea at Dickey's Barbecue in South Jordan, Utah and immediately said she thought she'd drunk acid.

Authorities have said a restaurant employee unintentionally put the heavy-duty cleaner lye in a sugar bag, and another worker mistakenly mixed it into the iced tea dispenser. Lye, which looks like sugar, is an odorless chemical used for degreasing deep fryers.

Harding's attorney initially said she had suffered deep burns to her mouth and esophagus. She was released from the hospital on Saturday after making a 'miraculous' recovery, the lawyer said.
