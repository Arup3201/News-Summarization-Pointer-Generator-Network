A draconian crackdown on the public’s right to know what the police are doing was demanded by Lord Justice Leveson.

He called for a ban on the press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested.

Also, the ‘off-the-record’ briefing of journalists would be barred, and senior police officers would be expected to log details of any contact they have with reporters and make the details widely available.

A string of major scandals have been uncovered over the years by unauthorised police sources who could in future be frightened to speak out.

Lord Justice Leveson said he had not found any extensive evidence of police corruption, and the scale of the problem of ‘leaks’ to reporters should be kept in proportion.

He also downplayed the scale of so-called cosy relations between the police and journalists.

Just some of the stories that might never have come to light: A series of disclosures to Daily Mail reporters propelled the Stephen Lawrence inquiry forward; right, Scotland Yard embroiled in a race war

The inquiry chairman said: ‘No one could reasonably conclude that inappropriately lavish entertainment is or has been rife in the Metropolitan Police Service or that the officers involved in what may be described as the most damaging evidence were corrupt.

'The issue is about perception, more than integrity.’

But the report then went on to highlight a string of scenarios where contact between police and the Press should be curtailed.

He said it should be ‘mandatory’ for all officers of Acpo rank – the most senior police – to record all of their contact with the media on a ‘brief note’, explaining what the conversation was about.

Where the discussion involves a more ‘significant’ matter, the note must be more detailed.

He also says senior staff must consider whether they need a press officer present.

It also said that Acpo guidance should ‘more specifically spell out the dangers of consuming alcohol in a setting of casual hospitality (without necessarily specifying a blanket ban)’.

The judge also wants far tighter controls on police taking journalists on operations such as raids – which provide a valuable insight to the public on how the police work – for fear of ‘violating the private rights of individuals’.

The report goes on: ‘I think that it should be made clear that save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there may be an immediate risk to the public) the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or public.’

The report suggested putting a 12-month ‘cooling off’ period into contracts that would stop former senior police officers being employed by the press.

Last night, Andy Trotter of the Association of Chief Police Officers said it would need to consider the report ‘carefully’.

He added: ‘Police should have a professional, open and transparent relationship with the public and the media.

'The media can provide a vital role in communicating with the public, helping society to solve crime, and holding public institutions to account.’

Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is responsible for the Metropolitan Police, rejected Leveson’s proposal for off-the-record briefings from the police to cease.

‘Clearly briefings are going to remain an important part of public life,’ he said.

Lord Justice Leveson doubtless thought he was helping to protect the innocent by calling for a ban on the identification of crime suspects who have been arrested but not charged.

But, if the public do not know a person is being held in custody, how are they supposed to come forward with any information they hold which could clear them, such as a cast-iron alibi?

Sweeping people off the streets and locking them up in secret is the hallmark of brutal totalitarian regimes, not mature democracies.

Equally chilling is the judge’s demand that senior police must keep a log – freely available to their superiors – of any contact they have with journalists.

Lord Justice Leveson says he is acting in the interests of ‘transparency’.

But, in reality, he risks creating a ‘closed shop’ in which police feel frightened of passing on information, even where it is of huge public interest, in case they are subject to a witch-hunt by officials who it suits to conceal inconvenient truths and restrict all communication to official channels.

Journalists will be treated, wrongly, as a potential enemy best avoided, despite the overwhelming majority of reporters being interested only in exposing wrongdoing, helping the police to bring criminals to justice and defending the public’s right to know.

Scandal upon scandal has been exposed by unauthorised briefings to the Press from police – not least the uncovering of the shocking failings in the original Stephen Lawrence investigation.

Leveson’s report also suggested that journalists could in future be forced to identify whistleblowers to the police.

Currently, journalists have protection under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act from disclosing material to the police, even if it is obtained by a source acting in an unlawful way.

But the judge says there should be a consultation on changing this rule. The danger is that good citizens desperate to expose wrongdoing will not come forward if they risk being named to the police and arrested.

The computer disc which contained the details of how MPs had been rampantly fiddling their expenses was technically stolen by a Westminster employee.

How many guilty men will escape justice and how much corruption go undetected if the Leveson Inquiry plan is implemented in full? 

Six major stories that would never have been told

By CHRIS GREENWOOD

Unofficial police sources are behind some of the most important revelations of corruption and wrongdoing in modern times.

Some of the stories that might never have come to light without unauthorised briefing include:

The Stephen Lawrence inquiryWhen the inquiry into the racist murder of the black 18-year-old lost its way it was off-the-record briefings that focused the minds of the country’s top police officers.

A series of disclosures to Daily Mail reporters propelled the story into the public eye and led to a series of reviews and questions from the highest level of Government.

Almost 30 years later, perpetrators were finally convicted and Stephen’s family finally found justice.

Lord BlairWhen the then Sir Ian, now Lord, Blair occupied the office at the top of New Scotland Yard, unauthorised disclosures raised serious questions about his stewardship.

One exposed his dubious decision to secretly record telephone conversations with Attorney General Lord Goldsmith.

Another raised questions about a £3million IT contract with Impact Plus, a company owned by his long-term friend and skiing partner Andy Miller.

The ensuing scandal ultimately led to Mr Mitchell’s resignation.

The Stalker AffairWhen senior Manchester police officer John Stalker was sent to Northern Ireland to head an inquiry into the shooting of Republican suspects by the RUC, he was subjected to an extraordinary smear campaign.

He was suspended from duty, but junior officers privately briefed newspapers and the BBC about his treatment.

All charges against him were dropped.

Ali DizaeiThe actions of the corrupt Scotland Yard commander were laid bare thanks to unauthorised leaks to the Daily Mail.

Information from unnamed colleagues led to intense scrutiny of his activities and eventually his conviction for perverting the course of justice.

Operation CountrymanThe four-year inquiry into corruption at the City of London and Met forces might well have collapsed were it not for key off-the-record briefings.

Dorset and Hampshire officers were obstructed from the start and turned to the Press to publicise their problems. The Government responded by ordering the Yard to co-operate.

Legal Update: In 2009 Mr Andrew Miller complained about an article dealing with the award by the MPS of contracts to his former company, Impact Plus. He brought proceedings for libel and was successful. The Court found, in December 2012, that there were no reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Miller was a willing beneficiary of improper conduct and cronyism because of his friendship with Sir Ian Blair in respect of the award of a number of MPS contracts to Impact Plus worth millions of pounds of public money. Mr Miller was awarded £65,000 damages.
