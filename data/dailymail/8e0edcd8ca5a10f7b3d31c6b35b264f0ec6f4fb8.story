A bar owner has apologised after a bouncer refused entry to a woman because she had tattoos on her neck.

Carol Paterson, 26, from Dundee, said she was 'mortified' at the 'disgusting' way she was treated by the bouncer at the city's West House.

The make-up artist and tattoo model had attended Dundee's major tattoo convention at Abertay Union, before she was turned away from the bar on Saturday night.

Carol Paterson, 26, said she was 'mortified' that she was turned away from a bar because of her tattoos

She claims she was urged to 'move on' by the bouncer when she tried to enter with friends.

She said: 'I walked up to the door with my two friends and my colleagues and the guy just said, "sorry, my manager's really against tattoos, so I can't let you in".

'I couldn't believe it and told him that was ridiculous. I was totally shocked and mortified to be honest because that's never happened to me before. The way I was treated was disgusting. It's discrimination.' 

Ms Paterson said she was wearing a high-collared top which showed off little of her neck tattoo - but was forced to go elsewhere with her friends. 

She added: 'How many other people has he discriminated against? The security company needs to know about this person.

'It is a personal thing for me because my boyfriend is a tattoo artist. I am heavily tattooed but I don't look like a thug and I would hate for people to look at me like that.'

The make-up artist said the way she was treated was 'disgusting' and was discrimination 

Andrew McMahon, who owns the bar, has now issued a full apology to Ms Paterson.

He said: 'As the owner of the West House I would like to apologise profusely.

'The doorman that refused you was from an outside agency.

'He has let myself and my business down massively and has created a horrendous impression, but most importantly he caused you great offence.

'We have no house rules in regard to tattoos. Many of my friends, family, customers, regulars, and even the majority of my staff have tattoos.

'So in no way do I have any issues with them.' 

Andrew McMahon, who owns Dundee's West House, has since issued an apology to Ms Paterson 

Ky Thomasson-Kay, 40, who organised the Dundee Tattoo Convention, said that discrimination against people with tattoos still exists.

'It simply comes down to someone making a very bad judgment call and I'm quite surprised it happened.

'In the past tattoos have been associated with prisoners, members of the armed forces, biker gangs and people on the edge of society.

'But in the last decade it's become mainstream and that's down to the quality of the artwork.

'There shouldn't be a stigma attached to tattoos these days and if someone has preconceptions then they're the one with the problem.' 

A spokesman for SecuriGroup, who confirmed that it supplies door staff to West House, declined to comment.
