Ciro Immobile scored a late equaliser as Borussia Dortmund came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at home to Stuttgart in the Bundesliga on Wednesday.

Stuttgart’s point in an encouraging display lifted the team from the bottom of the table only hours after the club fired director of sports Fredi Bobic.

Bayer Leverkusen rose to second by narrowly defeating Augsburg 1-0 in a match that was interrupted for seven minutes in the first half by a heavy storm.

Meanwhile, Hannover continued their best start to a season by beating Cologne 1-0 and Borussia Monchengladbach sent Hamburg back to the bottom of the table with a 1-0 victory. Hertha Berlin notched its first win of the season by beating Wolfsburg 1-0.

Bayern Munich went top of the standings by defeating Paderborn 4-0 on Tuesday. Bayern have 11 points, with Leverkusen and Hannover a point further back. 

Daniel Didavi pounced on mistakes by Dortmund’s defense in either half to put the visiting team 2-0 up.

But the speedy Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rounded Stuttgart goalkeeper Sven Ulreich in the 73rd to pull one back for Dortmund and Immobile four minutes from time.

'When you are up two goals, you should go home as the winner,' Stuttgart coach Armin Veh said.

Shinji Kagawa had Dortmund’s best chances. In the first half, he controlled the ball with his chest before hooking a shot past Ulreich but onto the bar and narrowly missed the target with a second half header. 

Dortmund are now eighth, four points behind Bayern, and have already conceded nine goals - 'way too many,' according to defender Mats Hummels.

In Leverkusen, Son Heung-min scored the only goal in the 33rd minute, before the match was interrupted by the storm five minutes later.
