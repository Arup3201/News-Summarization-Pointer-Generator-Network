Lewis Hamilton showed off his grueling fitness regime as he prepares for the opening race of the Formula One season in Australia on March 15.

The British driver will be hoping to defend his World Championship title and win his first race Down Under for the first time since 2008, with his Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg taking maximum points last season.

Hamilton driver posted a video on his Instagram page with the caption, 'Never give up. #TeamLH #AustralianGP #LetsGo!'

With Sebastian Vettel moving to Ferrari and his team mate Rosberg wanting to exact revenge for pipping him to the title, Hamilton knows he will need to be in top condition if he's to be top of the Championship come the end of the season.

Hamilton also showed he's not just good behind the wheel by also proving he's decent shot with a paintball gun - by firing shots at fitness instructors backside.

He may be gaining revenge for the training regime he's been given by Ville Vihola and struck the bare backside of his instructor a number of times. 

The Mercedes driver exacted some of his own revenge on his fitness instructor by shooting him in the bum

On what looked like a cold day, Hamilton showed no mercy by peppering Ville Vihola with paintballs
