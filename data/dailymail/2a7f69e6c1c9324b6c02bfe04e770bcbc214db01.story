New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been pictured posing with gun as he is charged with murder over the alleged execution of his friend Odin Lloyd.

Prosecutors claim that the 23-year-old tight end picked up Lloyd at his house, drove him to an abandoned industrial park and killed him with five gunshots - all because he talked to the 'wrong people' at a nightclub.

Hernandez, who had a $37.5million NFL contract, was arrested at his mansion in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, yesterday and charged with murder and weapons violations.

Less than two hours after his arrest, the Patriots cut Hernandez from the team - despite paying him a $12.5million signing bonus last year.

Charged: Aaron Hernandez was charged with murder and weapons counts on Wednesday afternoon

The picture of Hernandez posing with a
Glock handgun dates back to 2009, when he was playing 
football for the University of Florida in Gainesville, according to TMZ.

The website reported that Hernandez felt the need to stock up on guns because he was worried about death threats from members of gangs of which he used to be a part.

Friends told TMZ that the football star joined a gang when he was a teenager, but was concerned that figures from his 'old lifestyle' were angry that he had abandoned them.

His arrest yesterday caps off more than a week of 
intense media scrutiny. Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who 
was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend, was found murdered 
execution-style less than a mile from Hernandez's $1.3million home on 
June 17.

Hernandez is being held without bail, with the judge citing the gravity of the crime as the main reason behind his decision.

Hearing: A member of the state's attorney's office went through the detailed evidence against Hernandez

A piece of chewed bubblegum could prove to be the key piece of evidence in Aaron Hernandez's murder trial, according to prosecutors.

At a hearing yesterday, lawyers claimed that on the night of Odin Lloyd's murder the Patriots star stopped at a gas station to buy a pack of blue cotton-candy flavoured Bubblicious gum.

The next morning, Hernandez returned the car to the company which had hired it to him, whose staff cleared out its contents and put them in a dumpster.

Police later found a bullet shell casing, matching those found at the scene of Lloyd's shooting, next to a chewed piece of blue bubblegum.

DNA tests will be able to establish for sure whether the gum was chewed by Hernandez.

Hernandez has hired two of the 
nation's top criminal defense attorneys, who maintain that the evidence 
against him is 'circumstantial.'

According to the Boston Globe, prosecutors revealed that Hernandez 'orchestrated' the murder of Lloyd because he had talked to a group of people that Hernandez 'had trouble with' at a Boston nightclub on Friday night.

Deadspin reports that prosecutors have a video showing Hernandez with a handgun saying 'You can't trust anyone anymore' before making the trip to pick up Lloyd.

Prosecutors said Hernandez and two men picked 27-year-old Lloyd up at his house in Dorchester early Monday morning in a rented SUV. 

Apparently, Lloyd had misgivings about the meeting and sent text messages to his family.

'Did you see who I am with?' he asked. Then he responded, cryptically, 'NFL,' prosecutor said.

He later added: 'Just so you know.' It was his last text message.

In custody: The state's attorney argued that Hernandez had the means to flee and should be held without bail before his trial

Weeping: Relatives of murder victim Odin Lloyd were in the courtroom when Hernandez was charged

Support: Hernandez's live-in girlfriend Shayanna Jenkins was visibly emotional when she left the courthouse without him

Prosecutors then recounted how 
Hernandez drove Lloyd to the industrial park. When he stepped out of the
SUV, Hernandez allegedly shot him one in the chest with a .45-caliber 
pistol - knocking Lloyd to the ground, according to prosecutors.

As he lay on the ground, Lloyd reached up in an attempt to shield himself. Hernandez allegedly shot him four more times in the chest.

The investigation started more than a 
week ago after semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd was found slain in an
industrial park in North Attleborough, on the Rhode Island line not far
from where the Patriots play.

Video emerged of Hernandez being taken 
from his home in handcuffs, which followed after Massachusetts state 
police - wearing wetsuits and armed with metal detectors - combed 
through a stream near his home yesterday.

However, the officers left 
empty-handed after turning up no new evidence in the execution-style 
murder of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd, who was reportedly last 
seen partying with Hernandez in Boston.

A Massachusetts court said yesterday it had sealed documents related to the killing of Odin.

Attleboro
District Court officials said documents related to the case, including 
search warrants, have been impounded, meaning the public can't see them.

On
Saturday, investigators and police canines searched Hernandez's 
$1.3million mansion for a second time. They left with several brown 
paper bags of evidence, but did not make an arrest.

Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was friends with Hernandez and was with him on Monday morning before he was shot in the head.

His
body was dumped in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's
luxury home in the Boston suburb of North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

Hernandez, 23, has been under intense
media scrutiny since news of the murder broke. Police, however, have 
not named him - or anyone else - a suspect in the case.

About
two dozen reporters, photographers and video producers were camped 
outside his house on Monday, looking for any sign of the tight end, who 
signed a $37.5million five-year contract with the Patriots last year.

According to Fox25 sources,
a warrant was drawn up Friday morning for the arrest of Hernandez 
on a charge of obstruction of justice. But, it has not been officially 
issued or executed yet - suggesting that state police may be using it as 
bargaining chip in their talks with the defense lawyers, according to the TV station.  

Separate surveillance videos show Hernandez outside Lloyd’s home 
about an hour before the incident, and then walking into his own North 
Attleboro, Massachusetts, mansion after the shots were heard, according to the TV station.

Hernandez
returned to his Massachusetts home Friday amid speculations of an 
impending arrest just as it was announced that he has lost an 
endorsement deal.

The 
tight end had been drinking in a Boston bar with some friends on Sunday 
night - including  Lloyd, who was found shot dead 
'execution style' hours later.

His
body was found by a jogger in an industrial park half a mile from 
Hernandez's home. He was a semi professional football player for the 
Boston Bandits.

Amid the expanding murder 
investigation, it was announced last week that CytoSport, the maker of health 
supplements, has dropped Hernandez as the face of Muscle Milk.

‘In
light of the investigation involving Aaron Hernandez, CytoSport is 
terminating its endorsement contract with Mr. Hernandez, effective 
immediately,’ a company statement said.

Hernandez also has an endorsement deal with Puma. The 
athletic attire giant has declined to comment on the case. 

ABC News
reports that Hernandez's security system was 
smashed - including the surveillance videos. He also handed over his 
cell phone to investigators 'in pieces.'

This week, Hernandez was sued by his 
former friend friend and personal assistant Alexander Bradley over 
claims that he shot Bradley in the face during a fight at a Miami 
nightclub in February.

Bradley
claims he lost one eye when a gun owned by Hernandez went off in his 
car as they drove away together following a heated argument.

Search results: Police spent four hours scouring Hernandez's home and then left after placing four bags of evidence into a crime scene truck

A
fourth-round pick in the 2010 draft, Hernandez was named to the Pro 
Bowl in his second season. Last season he caught 51 passes and scored 
five touchdowns for the Patriots.

He is spending the off-season recovering from a shoulder scope.

Hernandez,
a University of Florida Graduate and native of Bristol, Connecticut., 
was drafted by the Patriots in 2010. He had five touchdowns for the Pats
during the 2012 season.

On
August 27, 2012, the Patriots signed Hernandez to a five-year 
extension, which included a $12.5 million signing bonus, the largest 
signing bonus ever given to an NFL tight end, and the second-largest 
extension ever, after teammate Rob Gronkowski's.
