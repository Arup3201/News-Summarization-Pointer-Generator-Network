Neymar made a blistering start to his World Cup on Thursday night with a double against Croatia - but UK broadcaster ITV have been forced to apologise after their online service stopped as the 22-year-old scored his second goal from the penalty spot.

Brazil's star - who has long been hailed as the 'next Pele' - cancelled out Marcelo's own goal in the first half before converting a contentious penalty when Fred went down easily in the box.

But some ITV viewers were left scrambling to find footage of the goal. Thankfully for them, Brazil legend Kaka was on hand with an Instagram video of the finish from the stadium in Sao Paulo.

The broadcaster said: 'We’re seeing unprecedented numbers of users during the game.

'We apologise for any inconvenience, we’re working hard to resume normal service.'

It later added: “We’re so sorry for the disruption tonight. It wasn’t planned and we know it came at a crucial time during the match. Apologies again.'

Chelsea midfielder Oscar completed the scoring in injury time as Brazil made a winning start - if unconvincing - start to their Group A campaign.

After his brace, Neymar posted a selfie with his model girlfriend Gabriella Lenzi taken on his Superman-covered smartphone.

The first day of the Cup had an added romantic edge to it with Brazil's Valentine's Day also falling on June 12, instead of the more commonly observed February 14, a fact that wasn't lost on Neymar amid the excitement.

'Thanks for being part of this moment, this great dream I'm doing!' Neymar told his more than 5.7 million Instagram followers.

'Today was an almost perfect day ... Just 
missed seeing you kkkk Happy Valentine's Day my love!'

As if the spotlight wasn't on Neymar enough as he carries the hopes of 200 million Brazilians on his shoulders, his profile is only enhanced by his relationship with the swimsuit model.

The 22-year-old forward recently linked up with the supermodel from Sao Paulo, who has more than 400,000 Instagram followers of her own thanks to a steady supply of bikini-clad images, after splitting up with soap starlet Bruna Marquezine in January.

While Croatia fumed about the 
controversial penalty decision that gave Neymar the chance to put the 
hosts up 2-1 and sent the Sao Paulo crowd into raptures, Brazil celebrated the ideal start to their campaign for a sixth title.

It
 didn't start perfectly, however, with Croatia taking the lead after 11 
minutes with a swift counter-attack ending with an own goal from Real 
Madrid's Marcelo. Neymar struck back in the 29th minute with his 
left-footed strike from range to leave honours even at half-time.

Neymar's penalty and Oscar's 90th-minute finish ended the dream of an upset for Croatia.
