The Beverly Hills mansion that featured in The Godfather and The Bodyguard, and provided a romantic retreat for John F Kennedy and his new bride Jackie on their honeymoon, is being listed for $135 million.

The historic mansion, set on six acres of land close to Sunset Boulevard, has had only four owners since it was built in the 1920s, but countless A-list celebrities, royalty and high-profile figures have been guests there.

From the honeymooning Kennedys, to parties for Rihanna and Prince Albert of Monaco, the legendary Beverly House had become nearly as famous as those who have graced its rooms.

Romantic retreat: The lavish estate was used by the Kennedys on their honeymoon

The sprawling estate, which includes a 50,000sq ft house, cascading waterfalls leading to a swimming pool, and a two-story library, is a mix of period features and luxurious flourishes.

A spa, 22ft tall hand-painted arched ceiling, billiards room complete with a carved fireplace from Hearst Castle in California, and parquet flooring are just some of the features in the 30-bedroom, 40-bathroom estate.

Current owner Leonard Ross, who bought the mansion in 1976 when he was just 31, said it takes two hours to show prospective buyers around.

He paid $2 million for the house, but told ABC News that despite its current $135 million price tag the property was an 'investment that could only go up in value'.

He admitted that when he bought the property it was 'much larger than I needed'.

Original features: The parquet floor and stone fireplace in the billiards room were installed when the house was built in the 1920s

The iconic home, made famous by the horse head scene in The Godfather, is being listed by Hilton Hyland, who describe it as a 'perfect combination of Italian and Spanish style'.

The property has an outside terrace that can seat 400 for dinner, an art deco nightclub, tennis courts, gym and array of guest cottages and accommodation for staff.

Built out of 
terracotta stucco, the H-shaped residence combines Spanish and Italian 
style. It has intricately carved ceilings and paneled walls, French 
doors, balconies, arched ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, which 
overlook the pool and Venetian columns 
beyond the pool house.

Alongside financier Ross, previous owners included newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, who was given the house as a gift by actress Marion Davies, and banking executive Milton Getz, who commissioned Hoover Dam architect Gordon Kaufmann to build the home.
