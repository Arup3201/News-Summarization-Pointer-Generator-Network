Dramatic footage has emerged of a robber using a moped to ram their way through a shop window during a late night smash-and-grab.

CCTV footage taken of the incident shows the brazen robber parking outside Made.com's Charing Cross Road store before making several attempts to drive their way through the glass.

Scotland Yard is now investigating the furniture store robbery after the driver and his accomplices were seen making off with two iMac computers.

A Made.com spokesperson told MailOnline the company had tightened security and was offering vouchers to anyone who provided information which led to an arrest. 

'We can confirm that two computers were taken from our new Charing Cross showroom at 11.15pm on Tuesday night.

'The showroom was back open for business as usual the next morning.

'Luckily, no one was in the building at the time and we’re assisting police with their enquiries.

'It’s a big deal for an online brand like us to transition offline and this kind of crime demonstrates the risks of being on the high-street.'
