Schools found ‘indoctrinating pupils about gay people’ will face being closed down under new rules designed to promote ‘British values’, the Government confirmed today.

The Department for Education insisted it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest teachers would have to give lessons on gay rights.

But a spokesman insisted Ofsted, which has introduced the new rules the wake of the Islamist Trojan Horse plot to radicalise pupils in Birmingham, was right to ensure schools were not breeding grounds for homophobia.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said any schools found 'indoctrinating' children against homosexuality faced being closed down

A spokesman said: ‘Ofsted are rightly ensuring that schools do not indoctrinate pupils about gay people - or any other people - being inferior.

‘The same goes for schools that do things like make girls sit separately at the back of the class. Both are practices which go directly against the fundamental British values of tolerance and respect.

‘We believe schools should prepare all pupils for life in modern Britain. A broad and balanced curriculum is vital for this.’

But the spokesman said it was 'nonsense' to say children would be taught gay rights.

Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said Mrs Morgan 'clearly does not believe that LGBT rights are British values'.

He said: ‘Compulsory sex and relationship education, including LGBT rights, in all schools is common sense, not nonsense.

‘Nicky Morgan should apologise for the offence that has been caused by claiming that it is nonsense for all schools to teach gay rights.’

It came after the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan – who said last week that she had changed her mind about gay marriage after voting against its introduction – warned schools not to ‘close minds’.

She told the Sunday Times that schools must teach ‘pupils to respect other people even if they do not agree with them’. 

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw will mark down any schools which do not 'actively promote' British values

Mrs Morgan said: ‘I should have thought this is a principle with which the vast majority of people would agree. All schools of whatever type have a duty to protect young people and to ensure they leave school fully prepared for life in modern Britain.

‘These values — democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs — are not new. The requirement to “actively promote” them is designed to reinforce the importance this government attaches to these values.’

Schools have been warned that those that fail to follow new rules on British values will be judged inadequate and could face closure by Ofsted inspectors.

The move follows snap inspections by Ofsted at 40 schools, including those for Christian and Jewish pupils. They were launched in the wake of the Trojan Horse affair in Birmingham as part of the government’s efforts to combat extremism.

Mrs Morgan is backing Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw who will say that any school suspected of not teaching a broad and balanced curriculum, of rapidly falling standards or of not preparing children for life in modern Britain will face no-notice inspections.

For the first time the rules give inspectors the powers to downgrade schools where teachers are breaching the Equality Act, which encourages respect for lesbian, gay and transgender people as well as those of other religions and races.
