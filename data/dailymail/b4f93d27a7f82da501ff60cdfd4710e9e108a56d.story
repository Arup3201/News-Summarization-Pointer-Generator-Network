Nicola Benedetti, whose album Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy has entered the top 20 of the UK Official Album chart

She became BBC Young Musician of the Year when she was 16, was named one of Britain’s most powerful young women earlier this year and already has an MBE and eight honorary degrees.

But Nicola Benedetti has added yet another string to her bow.

Yesterday she became the first solo British violinist since the 1990s to enter the Top 20 of the official UK albums chart with her record Homecoming: A Scottish Fantasy. She is also the first ever Scottish classical artist to enter the Top 20. It’s at number 19 and expected to rise.

The last British violinist to score a Top 20 album as a solo performer was Vanessa Mae in 1995. Nigel Kennedy achieved the same feat in 1989.

Miss Benedetti, who is due to perform at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: ‘I am absolutely thrilled to have reached the Top 20, not something a classical artist ever expects. This is a deeply personal recording inspired by Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy.

'The project took me deep into the heart of Scottish culture. I hope the music, in all its diversity, is providing some uplift  and pleasure.’

Earlier this year the 26-year-old lashed out at critics who claim glamorous classical musicians succeed because of their sexy image rather than their artistic ability.

She said it amounted to sexism when talented female artists were judged on their looks, adding: ‘Classical music can be prouder of its integrity than many industries. People are basically chosen for their ability.’

Miss Benedetti’s latest achievement follows her MBE in 2013 for her educational and charity work. She was named in Britain’s Top 30: The Young Female Power List, published in the Times in February, alongside the likes of Adele, Emma Watson and the Duchess of Cambridge.

Her rendition of Scottish Fantasy, a piece of classical music written in 1880 by the German romantic composer Max Bruch, now sits in the mainstream chart alongside pop acts such as Will.i.am – a judge on BBC talent show The Voice.

The number one spot was claimed by the rapper and producer.

His new single has gone straight in at the top of the charts to give him his 10th UK number one.

It’s My Birthday, featuring 17-year-old American singer Cody Wise, tops the pile 11 years after The Voice judge’s first number one, 2003’s Black Eyed Peas hit Where Is The Love,

He knocked reigning chart queens Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea down to two with Problem, while Ella Henderson also slides one to number three with Ghost, according to the Official Chart Company.

The pop star now has five solo number one singles in Britain, the same as he has with the Black Eyed Peas.
