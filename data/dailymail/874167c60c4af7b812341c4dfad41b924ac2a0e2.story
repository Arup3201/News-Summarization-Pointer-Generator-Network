They are the secret files deemed too incendiary for public consumption – and locked away for a lifetime.

Now, after half a century under lock and key, eyewitness accounts of the bloody birth of a nation have been revealed.

The personal testimony of thousands of men and women who took part in the Easter Rising and War of Independence can be accessed free online.

Kept under wraps for half a century for fear of creating controversy, the entire contents of the ‘Bureau of Military History 1913-1921’ have been digitised by Ireland's Military Archives.

The bureau was set up by the then minister for defence, Oscar Traynor, in 1947 to capture first-hand recollections from virtually all the surviving figures from the formation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913 until The Truce in 1921.

Many of those involved were growing old and the State was anxious to record their memories before it was too late.

Witness statements were taken from members of organisations including the Irish Volunteers (subsequently the IRA), the Irish Republican Brotherhood, Cumann na mBan, Sinn Féin and the Irish Citizen Army. The project took a total of 10 years and was completed in 1957.

However, the contents were regarded as highly sensitive and controversial as a result of the bitter legacy of the Civil War that immediately followed Independence.

Many of the 1,773 witnesses testified on the understanding that the material would not be released in their lifetime.

Capt Stephen Mac Eoin of Military 
Archives explained that the material was locked away until 2001, when it
was sent to the Defence Forces to prepare it for public release.

The Irish War of Independence was mounted by the IRA against the British government and its forces in Ireland.

It began in January 1919 following the declaration of independence by the Irish Republic. In July 1921, both sides agreed to a ceasefire.

The Easter Rising in 1916 resulted from the Volunteers - who declared a republic - launching an insurrection with the aim to end British rule and found an Irish Republic.

More than 400 people died during the rising, which was confined to Dublin. The response of the British was to execute the leaders of the insurrection and arrest thousands of activists, which gave support to the separatist Sinn Fein.

Irish public opinion was shocked by some of the actions of British troops and by the time of the November 1918 election, alienation from British rule was widespread.

The 36,000 pages of searchable documents, rare photographs and voice recordings are available at militaryarchives.ie

The entries in the archive document the real-life experiences of the men who fought during the Rising and their treatment after.

A number started a hunger strike as part of their struggle to be treated as prisoners of war. The first to die was Volunteer Thomas Ashe and in this entry, Volunteer William McNamara, from Ennis, Co. Clare, describes the mood in Mountjoy before Ashe’s death in 1917.

‘We received orders to go on hunger strike… I believe we were six or seven days without food or exercise when, one morning, three warders rushed into my cell and dragged me to the prison doctor’s room, where I was placed on an armchair.

'My legs and hands were tied to it and my head held back. The doctor commenced the "forcible feeding".

'Although I was very weak I resisted but failed to prevent him from feeding me as he forced some kind of instrument into my mouth, causing it to remain open. Next, he inserted the tube and fed me.

'I was taken back to my cell in a very exhausted condition. Each prisoner had to go through the same treatment.

'We got orders from our leader to resist as best we could. I was fed twice per day and each time the warders had to carry me up to the chair where I continued to resist as best I could.

'I was fed through both the nose and mouth. All told I think I was forcibly fed 13 times during the strike which lasted 14 or 15 days. I felt very weak the whole time but as I had no mattress and had to lie down on the boards I was at a disadvantage…

'We heard Thomas Ashe had died and that Joe McDonagh and James Griffey of Ennis were in hospital in a very weak condition.

'All of us got medical treatment until we were restored to normal health, after which we were treated as prisoners of war.’
