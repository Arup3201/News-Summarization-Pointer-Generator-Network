Roberto Martinez has expressed relief after Kevin Mirallas and Leon Osman received positive news on the injuries that had left him fearing they would face long lay-offs.

Mirallas, who was left on crutches following a heavy challenge by QPR's Jordon Mutch, will miss Saturday's trip to Southampton with damaged ankle ligaments but he is expected to be ready for the Boxing Day clash at Goodison Park with Stoke.

Osman, meanwhile, does not require surgery on the problem that had left him wearing a protective boot on his ankle and he should be fit to play a part in a period over Christmas that Martinez will shape Everton's season.

Kevin Mirallas picked up an injury during Everton's win over QPR on Monday night 

Mirallas left the pitch on a stretcher but is not expected to be out for too long 

'We have great news,' said Martinez. 'We were very, very worried after the game because it was an action where you feel there was definite damage.

'But the scans have showed it was the least it could have been. The game on Saturday is a bit too early, but I don't think he will be out for too long.

'I wouldn't rule him out of any more games over Christmas.'

'Leon is progressing well, we are assessing him day by day. An operation was the worst case scenario, but he has reacted well enough and we are hopeful he will be OK without the need for that.'

Osman got into the festive spirit at the club's training ground by wearing a Christmas jumper 

Starting with Southampton, Everton have a run of four games in 12 days and Martinez has urged his squad to take advantage of a prime opportunity and get some momentum to set them up for an assault on the Champions League places in the New Year.

Martinez, who has ruled out the idea of making big changes during the January transfer window, said: 'We can see every game as an opportunity now. The games we have got now are very important.

'The only concentration is on the league. The next 12 days are going to be really significant in terms of the second half of the season. I am delighted with how the squad is.

'The group has a very strong mentality. The only thing that we can be critical about is that we have not got the points we should have done. I am very excited about what I can see coming in the second half of the season as I can see something special building in the dressing room.'

Martinez is not being lulled into a false sense of security ahead of the trip to St Mary's by the run of five consecutive defeats Southampton have suffered in all competitions, including the humbling they endured at Bramall Lane in the Capital One Cup against Sheffield United. Everton's manager is a firm admirer of his opposite number Ronald Koeman.

Martinez added: I know how good Ronald Koeman is. He has had many experiences in different leagues. Everything he does with his team is about positional play. He was part of one of the best teams in world football. I wish him every luck after Saturday.'
