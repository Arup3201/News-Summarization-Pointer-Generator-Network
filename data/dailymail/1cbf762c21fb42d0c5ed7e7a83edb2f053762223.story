Rock Hudson’s wife confronted him about his homosexuality decades before the public knew he was gay - and told him to ‘grow out of it’.

Phyllis Gates told her husband in 1958 that there was ‘nothing glandular’ about his interest in men, as if being gay were a disease.

She also rebuked him for the ‘great speed’ with which he made love to her and accused him of picking up rent boys from the street, even after they were married.

Screen idol: Rock Hudson was married to Phyllis Gates, his agent's secretary, from 1955 to 1956

The eye-popping conversation was taped at Gates’ request by notorious Hollywood private investigator Fred Otash.

He carried out surveillance on everybody from Marilyn Monroe to John F Kennedy from the mid 1950s until 1965, when his California investigator’s license was revoked.

Otash was hired by Gates, an interior decorator, to keep an eye on her marriage to Hudson. It had been seen as a move to placate his fans who wanted to know why, at the age of 29, he was still single.

The marriage would last just three years and ended in April 1958, supposedly because he inflicted mental cruelty on her.

The conversation between them was on January 21 that year and starts off with Gates being frank about her views on homosexuality.

She says: ‘There isn't anything glandular about homosexuality, it is only freezing at an emotional state, and it's up to the individual to grow out of it.

‘Everyone has to help themself, Rock.’

Gates then talks to him about conversations with his doctor and asks about a Rorschach test in which he looked at inkblots and said whatever came to his mind first.

According to the transcript of the conversation, she says: ‘You told me you saw thousands of butterflies and also snakes.

‘[A therapist] told me in my analysis that butterflies mean femininity and snakes represent the male penis. 

‘I'm not condemning you, but it seems that as long as you recognize your problem, you would want to do something about it.’

She also remonstrated with him about his ‘great speed with me, sexually’ and asked: ‘Are you that fast with boys?’

Hudson responded: ‘Well, it's a physical conjunction. Boys don't fit. So, this is why it lasts longer.’

Gates, who died in 2006, responds: ‘Everyone knows that you were picking up boys off the street shortly after we were married and have continued to do so, thinking that being married would cover up for you.’

Hudson replies that he has ‘never’ picked up any boys on the street or in bars ‘other than to give them a ride’.

Hudson, who died in 1985 aged 59 due to complications related to AIDS, broke the hearts of a generation of women when his homosexuality was made public three months before his death.

Talk of the town: Marilyn Monroe being interviewed in 1956. Her conversations were also recorded by Otash

He had been considered one of the most 
desirable men of his day, starring alongside female screen 
icons such as Doris Day in classics such as‘Pillow Talk’.

Icon: Otash's files claim he cleared sleeping pills from Judy Garland's apartment

Otash died in 1992 having been used 
as the inspiration for the shady PI played by Jack Nicholson in the 
Oscar-winning 1974 film Chinatown.

His files lay in storage for two 
decades until being made public for the first time by his daughter 
Colleen to The Hollywood Reporter.

The tapes also detail how Otash was hired by Marilyn Monroe to monitor her when she was having sex with Kennedy - and even record her on the night that she died.

In his notes he claims that on August 5 1962 she had a violent argument with the Kennedys and that she felt that she had been ‘passed around like a piece of meat’.

The notes read: ‘She was really screaming and they were trying to quiet her down.

‘She’s in the bedroom and Bobby gets 
the pillow and he muffles her on the bed to keep the neighbors from 
hearing. She finally quieted down and then he was looking to get out of 
there.’

Otash only found out she had died later on.

His
other files include information on Judy Garland and how in 1963 he 
cleaned her Beverly Hill apartment out of all the pills and alcohol she 
had stashed during her bitter split from third husband Sid Luft.
