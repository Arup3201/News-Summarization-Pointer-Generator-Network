Britain has evacuated its last
special forces from Yemen because of the deteriorating security
situation there. 

The move was confirmed by a source familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters today and follows an announcement by US officials on Saturday that the country had evacuated its own remaining personnel, including about 100 special operations forces.

US State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said in a statement: 'Due to the deteriorating security situation in Yemen, the US government has temporarily relocated its remaining personnel out of the country.'

US forces evacuated al Annad airbase near the southern city of al Houta, which was captured by al Qaeda militants on Friday.  

Their British counterparts are understood to have been airlifted from the capital Sana'a over the weekend. The Ministry of Defence does not comment on special forces matters.

Britain withdrew staff from its embassy in Yemen last month
and temporarily suspended operations there as  northern-based Houthi rebels continued their march south.

Washington and Paris also closed their embassies last month as the country teeters on the brink of all-out civil war.

The latest withdrawal came as pro-Houthi police troopers used tear gas to disperse anti-Houthi protesters in Yemen's southwestern city of Taiz. 

Iran-backed Houthis took over the city on Sunday in an escalation of a power struggle diplomats say risks drawing in neighbouring oil giant Saudi Arabia and its main regional rival Iran.

The Houthis agreed to share power with Hadi after they seized Sana'a in September.

That split the army, parliament was dissolved in February and violence continues to intensify between the two sides.

Also today soldiers loyal to Yemeni president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi fought off dozens of Shi'ite Houthi militiamen heading for the Sunni leader's seat of power in the southern city of Aden, militia sources and a local official told Reuters. 

Mr Hadi fled to the southern city of Aden in February after escaping from house arrest in Sana'a.

The Houthis have taken control of the capital and six provinces. 

On Friday, Islamic State affiliates claimed responsibility for two bombs at mosques in Sana'a. As many as 150 people were killed in bomb blasts in the capital last week and 345 people were injured during the rush for Friday prayers. 

If the group was behind the attacks, it would mark its first large-scale foray into the country and could raise the prospect of a bloody Shia versus Sunni conflict.

The CIA and US military have carried out drone strikes against insurgents in Yemen for many years.

A 2011 strike killed influential cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was the motivator behind many terrorist attacks against the West and is said to have influenced the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. 

Gulf Arab countries will take necessary measures to protect the region against 'aggression' by the Houthi group if a peaceful solution cannot be found to that country's turmoil, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said today.

Prince Saud, who also remarked that the kingdom opposed Iranian 'interference' in Yemen, was speaking at a joint news conference in Riyadh with visiting British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.

Hammond said Britain would discuss with Saudi Arabia and the United States how to reinforce the position of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, adding: 'None of us wants to see military action.'
