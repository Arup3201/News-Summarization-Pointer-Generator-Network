A woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by four footballers, including the son of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, admitted telling a ‘pack of lies’ to police today.

The alleged victim said she had given false information to police but expected them to piece the case together ‘like CSI’.

The 21-year-old also denied getting into a hotel bed voluntarily with two footballers and refuted a defence suggestion that she tried to kiss and cuddle George Barker and Anton Rodgers who were dressed in their boxer shorts.

Denial: The footballers, including Steve Cook, left, and Lewis Dunk, right, (both pictured today) deny sexual assault

Brighton and Hove Albion players Rodgers, 19, Barker, 21, Lewis Dunk, 21, and former team-mate Steve Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, have been accused of photographing themselves while sexually assaulting the woman while she was passed out in a hotel room.

Rodgers, Barker and Dunk, from Brighton,
 and Cook, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, deny sexual assault. 
All four men also deny voyeurism.

The woman, who was 19 at the time, 
said she had been drinking in clubs but denied she had 15 shots of 
alcohol before passing out.

After missing work the next day, she told her bosses she had been attacked in the street because she feared being sacked.

She
 said after they insisted on calling the police, she told more lies but 
dropped 'hints' she picked up from watching CSI on television.

She changed her story six months later after being repeatedly taunted by another footballer.

Giving
 evidence for a second day, she admitted giving false information to the
 police, saying: ‘I thought it would be like CSI, where they find out 
the evidence and come back to me.

‘I was trying to give a hint at the truth.’

Judge Charles Wide QC said: ‘She has admitted she told a pack of lies.’

Police threatened to drop the investigation after two months because the alleged victim was not cooperating, the court heard.

The prosecution at the Old Bailey alleges the players took mobile phone photographs showing lewd scenes.

She is said to have discovered the pictures on Rodgers’ phone after waking up the next morning to find herself lying half naked on a hotel bed.

The woman has admitted telling lies to police but maintains she is telling the truth about having no recollection of what went on in the room.

Mark Cotter, defending Barker, said: 'I suggest to you that Mr Rodgers and Mr Barker were in the double bed in their boxer shorts and you got into bed between them.

'I suggest you initiated an attempt to kiss and cuddle Mr Rodgers and then did the same with Mr Barker.'

The woman replied: 'I definitely did not.'

Mr Cotter suggested she was 'a prolific liar' who had lied about photographs she had seen on a mobile phone.

Asked if she had 'seriously exaggerated' the contents of pictures, she answered: 'It was humiliating and they should not have done it. They have to live with it.'

The offence is alleged to have taken place in July 2011 at the Jurys Inn hotel in Brighton after the club's victory in a cup match.

When shown a picture in court of Barker posing by his initials in foam on the woman's thigh, she said it was not the picture she saw, which had shown her underwear pulled up.

During the hearing Mark Cotter, for Barker, told her: ‘One of the things you told the police in your interview, which you didn’t mention yesterday, was trying to send photographs to yourself.

‘You say you were thinking clearly enough to do that.’

The woman replied: ‘I was thinking I need to have evidence to prove what happened.’

The barrister continued: ‘You have got the phone in your hand.’

She said: ‘I don’t know why I didn’t take it and ran out of the room. I would have had much more evidence.'

Mr
 Cotter asked: ‘Is the reality that you didn’t delete these photographs 
and didn’t pick up your shoes and bag and run down the corridor with 
Anton Rodgers’ phone because the photographs that were on the phone were
 nowhere near as graphic or containing the content you have described?’

Location: The Jury's Inn Hotel, in Brighton, where the offences were said to have happened

‘They were,’ said the alleged victim. ‘I wish I had that phone. It would prove it to you.’

Earlier, she claimed she had drunk just four shots and a few beers and had not been hungover but ‘dazed’ when she came around.

But Mr Cotter accused her of having a ‘tendency to exaggerate the truth’, adding: ‘Some times you say things that are downright lies.’

‘No, I don’t,’ she replied.

The trial continues.
