Tens of thousands of public sector jobs in Scotland are at risk if voters choose independence next week, pro-Union campaigners warned yesterday.

More than 57,000 Scots are employed by Westminster departments or UK-wide public bodies such as the BBC.

Splitting from the rest of Britain would put many civil service positions in jeopardy as the smaller Scottish state would not need all of them, No vote supporters say.

The pro-Union Better Together campaign have said an independent Scotland would have to cut public spending by £6billion, putting thousands of jobs at risks 

There are also question marks over whether an independent Scotland would be able to afford to maintain its large public sector if oil revenues fall.

A total of 545,200 Scottish workers are employed by the state, making up more than 21 per cent of the total labour market.

By contrast less than 17 per cent of jobs in England are in the public sector, official figures from the start of this year show.

A recent report by the Institute for Government think-tank noted that some of the largest Westminster departments are ‘over-represented’ in Scotland.

Scotland makes up about 8 per cent of the UK’s population, but has 11 per cent of jobs in the Department for Work and Pensions and 12 per cent in HM Revenue and Customs.

Some 57,800 Scots work for Whitehall ministries or quangos and other public bodies that cover the whole of Britain.

Westminster’s biggest employer in Scotland is the Ministry of Defence, which has 3,900 civil servants and 10,600 uniformed personnel north of the border.

Former defence secretary Philip Hammond warned last year that these jobs and defence contracts worth billions of pounds would be put in peril if Scottish voters opted for independence.

The Department for Work and Pensions employs a further 10,700 Scots, while 9,000 work for HM Revenue and Customs.

Another 600 jobs are based at the offices of the Department for International Development (Dfid) in East Kilbride, representing a third of the ministry’s total workforce.

The BBC has about 1,200 employees in Scotland, but it is unclear precisely what would happen to them in the event of independence.

SNP leader Alex Salmond wants to create a new public service broadcaster called the Scottish Broadcasting Service, which would ‘initially be founded on the staff and assets of BBC Scotland’.

Scottish institutions account for the bulk of public sector workers in the country. These jobs would not be affected immediately by a vote in favour of independence.

Some 248,000 Scots work in local government, including schools, and 158,000 are employed by NHS Scotland.

The Scottish Government and its agencies have 16,900 staff, while 28,700 people work for the Scottish police or fire services.

Labour MP Michael McCann fears that hundreds of Dfid jobs in his East Kilbride constituency would be axed if the Yes campaign prevails next week.

He rejected SNP claims that all the posts would be maintained in a newly independent Scotland.

The Commons International Development Committee, which he sits on, has calculated that nearly all of the Dfid positions for Scots would be lost.

Mr McCann said: ‘What we established is that Scotland would have to set up its own international development agency. It would be a fraction of the size of the current operation in East Kilbride. It would mean 500 jobs would go.’

He accused Mr Salmond of making pledges he could not afford to fund and suggested that many Scottish public sector workers would vote to remain in the UK.

‘In a democracy you are entitled to vote against your own self-interest, but I doubt many people would,’ he said.

‘The majority of Scots are far too canny to be brought into this concept that you can get everything available for free. It simply doesn’t add up.’

A spokesman for the pro-Union Better Together campaign added: ‘The impartial experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say that a separate Scotland would need to cut public spending by an extra £6 billion. That puts jobs in the public sector at risk.

‘This is a risk that we just don't have to take. There is a better way for Scotland. We are guaranteed more powers for Scotland, backed up by the strength, security and stability of being part of the larger UK.

‘It's the best of both worlds. We should say “No Thanks” to putting that at risk on September 18.’

The Scottish Government’s White Paper on independence, launched last November, states that ‘many’ current Westminster jobs will transfer to the new separate Scotland in the event of a Yes vote.

It adds: ‘Independence will provide opportunities for employment in Scotland in government functions where jobs are currently located elsewhere in the UK.

‘Given that the Scottish Government will be taking on a range of new responsibilities, there will be new job opportunities in the public sector in Scotland.’

The Yes campaign declined to comment.
