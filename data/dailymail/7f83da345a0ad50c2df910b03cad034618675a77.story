One of the world's largest conventions took place this weekend, but there wasn't a single action hero or comic book character in site. 

Instead there was enhanced barbecue sauce, creams and plenty of new growing machines, all of which were designed to taste like or make one thing: Weed. 

Seattle's CannaCon convention, the largest marijuana convention in the world, kicked-off this weekend and painted the town green.

But there was plenty to taste too. Eric Schneider, owner of 'The Sauce Guy' barbecue sauce, showed off a new version of his sauce that was infused with cannabis hash oil 

The three-day expo, which ends Saturday, brings together buyers, exhibitors and appreciators of the medical and recreational marijuana industry, according to the Associated Press. 

While some visitors came merely for a taste, others visiting the expo had business on their mind. 

For $100, growers had access three days worth of seminars that included lectures such as ‘The Jaw-Dropping US History of Industrial Hemp’ and ‘How to Properly and Effectively Control the Climate of Your Indoor Grow’.

Comedian and marijuana activist Tommy Chong made an appearance to promote his products 'Chongwater' and 'smoke wipes', which get rid of the smell of marijuana from one's clothes 

Chong said that he always knew 'pot was good for you' and that national legalization of weed was inevitable

 There were no superhero capes at this convention, but there were Bob Marley backpacks as roller-skating women promoted a local medical marijuana dispensary 

There were tools on display as well, including pot trimmers, indoor garden tents and even a machine that creates hash oil. 

Instead of capes, girls with Bob Marley packs on their back advertised a local medical marijuana dispensary. 

And even Tommy Chong, half of the famous comedian stoner duo 'Cheech and Chong' and a prominent marijuana activist, was on hand to promote products and discuss his favorite herb. 

Products on display included 'Chongwater,' Tommy Chong's hemp-infused beverage, and the cannabis-infused 'Kush Creams'

Chong, whose items include the hemp-infused 'Chongwater' and 'smoke swipes' to remove the smell of ganja from one's clothes, said he always knew 'pot was good for you'. 

'I'm a cancer survivor thanks to pot and I like to give back to the community when I can,' he told The News Tribune. 

Chong, who spent nine months in jail in 2003 for distributing 7,500 bongs, said the legalization of marijuana was an inevitable 'tsunami'. 

'Either you flow with it or get out of the way, or it will bury you.' 

Marijuana became legal in Washington, and Colorado, in the 2012 election after state voters approved to legalization recreational weed for adults.  

The three-day expo kicked-off earlier this week and will end on Saturday
