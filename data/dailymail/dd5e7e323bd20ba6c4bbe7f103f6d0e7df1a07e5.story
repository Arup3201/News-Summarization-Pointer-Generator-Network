The skipper of a yacht who rescued a crew member after he was missing for 90 minutes in freezing temperatures said finding the sailor was worse than looking for 'a needle in a haystack'.

Sean McCarter , 32, was a skipper on the Derry-Londonderry-Doire boat in the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race.

He said his team mate would have been unconscious and possibly dead if he had not been wearing a dry suit.

Andrew Taylor, 46, from London, fell overboard 2,500 miles from land and was in the ocean for an hour and a half before being rescued.

The 46-year-old father from London was feared lost after he was swept out of view of his desperate crew around 2,500 miles from land this morning

Skipper Sean McCarter saved Andrew Taylor's life. Mr MrCarter admitted that the crew member who fell overboard may only have survived because he was wearing a wetsuit

Mr McCarter, a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution volunteer from near Londonderry, Northern Ireland said: 'The moment he went out of sight the Pacific all of a sudden becomes a very big place.

'We had our man overboard position marked on the chart which gives us a point to start searching from and we start going through the motions, trying to estimate where he might have drifted to with the wind and current.

'We started searching but I mean a needle in a haystack doesn’t even describe what we were looking for.'

Mr Taylor has now recovered from his terrifying ordeal, which happened in the early hours of Monday morning during the amateur yacht race.

It is only the fourth time in the race’s 18 year history that a competitor has fallen overboard.

At the time, Mr Taylor was suffering from severe shock after being hit by the rudder of the 70ft racing yacht as it swung past him. He was also suffering from hypothermia.

Miraculously, after an hour of searching in horrendous weather conditions, Mr Taylor's fluorescent life jacket was spotted (pictured)

The crew then performed a daring rescue operation which saw them expertly manoeuvre the boat close enough to Mr Taylor for one team member to grab hold of him

Mr Taylor recovered in the boat after the rescue. It is only the fourth time in the Clipper Race's 18 year history that a competitor has fallen overboard. All crew members were recovered

'I just heard a noise, then I got wiped out by a really big wave. That's when the storm started - God, the storm was bad, it was horrible,' he said

Mr Taylor was with Mr McCarter trying to change a head sail when the boat rolled violently and he was thrown into the water - despite being clipped on to the ship.

There were 17 other crew members on the boat.

Mr Taylor said: 'It happened so quickly. One second my feet were on the boat the next my head was in the water.

'There was nothing in between, it was just, bang, gone.

'There was no feeling of losing my balance or trying to get hold of something or looking for something to hang on to.'

Mr Taylor was brought into the boat to warm up after the ordeal

Mr Taylor said conditions deteriorated further while he was in the ocean being tossed about by waves. A storm then struck and the sailor was hit with rain, wind and hailstones.

He said: 'I got hit from behind by a really big wave. I heard it coming, white water.

'It hit me from behind, winded me, rolled me over, tipped me upside down, and rolled me over and over and over, like getting wiped out in a surf or washed up on a beach.'

He said that he watched as the boat 'got further and further away'

Mr Taylor was treated by an onboard medic for hypothermia and shock

'I
 just heard a noise, then I got wiped out by a really big wave. That’s 
when the storm started - God, the storm was bad, it was horrible.'

The yacht was about halfway through the 5,600-mile leg across the Pacific from Qingdao, China, to San Francisco when the accident happened.

Mr McCarter, who has sailed from a young age, said that searching for a longstanding crew member made the rescue operation more tense.

He said: 'Being a crew member on an RNLI lifeboat we respond to lots of those but there’s a certain detachment when its not somebody you know, a friend or a crew mate.

'You are just out looking for a diver in the water or somebody who has been swept off a rock.

'It’s not quite the same as somebody you were just talking with a few moments before, someone you have been sailing with for whatever it is, seven months at this stage, and ultimately somebody I am responsible for.'

The crew have been praised for putting all their training to good use and following man overboard procedures to the letter.

But with the conditions in the middle of the ocean, there were fears for Mr Taylor’s life.

The skipper said: 'The water temperature is 10-11 degrees so you really don’t want to have someone in there for really any longer than 10-15 minutes.

'We had huge seas, very strong winds, limited visibility, because the sea state was so bad and that made it a lot more challenging.

'As soon as we saw him the initial reaction was a huge relief and then followed quite quickly by: we don’t have a clue what state he is in. God forbid dead or alive, conscious, unconscious, injured.

'We got round and as soon as he could see the boat out of the corner of his eye we could see him waving his arms and that was another massive relief.

'We got near to him and before we knew it he was instructing us how to get him back on board.'

The Pacific leg of the Clipper, between China and the US, is the tenth of 16 stages in the world’s longest ocean race at more than 40,000 miles.

Justin 
Taylor, the director of the race, praised the efforts of the crew in recovering Mr Taylor.

He
 said: 'In these conditions a man overboard is swept away from the boat 
very quickly and visual contact can be lost in the swell.

'We
 have a well-rehearsed procedure to mark the position, stop racing and 
engaged the engine to search for and recover the crew member as quickly 
as possible.

'An hour 
and a half is a very long time to be in the water in these conditions 
but a combination of his sea survival training and seven months at sea 
as well as wearing a life jacket and dry suit will have contributed 
enormously to his survival.'

Sir
 Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person ever to sail round the world 
alone non-stop, added: 'The sea can be a harsh environment and we 
rehearse every eventuality including a man overboard.

'The procedures were put into practice flawlessly by the crew in difficult conditions.

'It is a tribute to their training and determination that Andrew was successfully recovered.'
