New York City head coach Jason Kreis has refused to dwell on the furore surrounding Frank Lampard's delayed move to the club and says his arrival midway through the season could actually provide a well-timed boost.

Former Chelsea midfielder Lampard agreed to sign for the new Major League Soccer franchise last July and was set to join up with his new team-mates in January ahead of the new season, which starts on Sunday.

The 36-year-old then joined New York's sister club Manchester City - both part of the City Football Group - on what was initially reported to be a short-term loan deal.

As it transpired, the deal at City was in fact a standalone one which, after a number of impressive performances for Manuel Pellegrini's side, was extended beyond January until the end of the Premier League season.

Lampard's decision to remain in Manchester and miss the start of New York's debut MLS campaign riled supporters of the franchise, but Kreis appears to have taken the potentially exacerbating episode in his stride.

'You know, I think we could look at that from a very negative point of view and say this is going to be really difficult and we had him pencilled in one way or another,'Kreis said in an interview with Bleacher Report.

'Or we can look at it from a positive point of view and say, OK, well, this means that some other guys are going to get meaningful opportunities to make significant contributions in his position for the first four or five months of the season, and you need that in our league.

'When you get to the end of the season and there's some real fatigue, injuries and suspensions, you need guys to be able to step in and not miss a beat. I think this affords us that opportunity. 

'We're going to be having a player that's going to be at the top of his game, extremely fit, coming right out of a Premiership season, which hopefully will he will have another medal to put in his pocket, and we can have a really significant, positive boost in the middle of the season.' 

New York begin their season against fellow MLS debutants Orlando City on Sunday.
