Two men are in police custody after CCTV footage, released by police following an alleged attack on a Sydney train, went viral. 

Police released the  footage of the men at 2:30pm on Tuesday following an incident in which a Sydney man, identified as Paul, was brutally bashed - and left with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches for a gash on his head and lip - after stepping in to defend two women.

The offenders had been harassing the women, according to police, while returning from an NRL match at Homebush on Saturday before Paul stepped in, in an attempt to bring the situation under control.

Two men have since been arrested following the incident, a 26-year-old and his 28-year-old brother 

The Sydney man, Paul, came away from the attack with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches to a gash on his head and lip

Only two hours after the surveillance images were shared on Facebook, the posts reached over 180,000 viewers and over 1000 shares, according to police. 

By 4:30pm a 26-year-old man was arrested after turning up at Penrith Police Station. 

His brother, a 28-year-old man, contacted investigators at Sydney City Local Area Command shortly afterwards and was arrested in his Zetland home.

Paul has spoken out about his actions on the train from Sydney Olympic Park to Central after the Penrith-Canterbury semi-final on Saturday, and says his intentions were to prevent any violence from erupting.

The 48-year-old was covered in blood after a vicious attack from two men. The culprits fled at Sydney's Central Station, police claim

'I thought I'd just ask the fellas to leave it alone and walk away, to just quieten everything down,' Paul told 9NEWS.

'There were innocent people on the train and these people were getting quite overheated. 

'I didn't want it to escalate to the stage where there was any violence.' 

Police say one of the men moved to sit down in a different part of the train, but his friend starting throwing punches.

'Loads of punches were being thrown,' Paul said.

After an argument had erupted, Paul said he went over to calm things down before the situation got out of control before he was allegedly attacked

Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics took Paul to St Vincent's Hospital

Police say during the argument one of the men punched a 48-year-old man in the face several times before he was allegedly held back by another man and punched again.

It's believed he fought back before other commuters intervened and separated the group as the train approached Central Railway Station. 

Police allege the two men ran from the train and ran down the stairs to the concourse where they were last seen getting on an esculator and heading towards Chalmers street.

Police were patrolling the station at the time of the incident and were able to go to Paul's aid.

The two attackers were both wearing Penrith Panther football jerseys during the brutal bashing on Saturday

Paramedics were also called to the scene and went to his aid and he was then taken to St Vincent's hospital where he underwent plastic surgery for a laceration to his lip. 

He also sustained a broken nose, two black eyes and a laceration to his forehead.  

'By the time the train reached Redfern, the 48-year-old man was concerned the conversation had become offensive,' said a NSW Police spokesperson.
