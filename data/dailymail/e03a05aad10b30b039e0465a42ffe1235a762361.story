The wife of a convicted sex offender has pleaded guilty to running an unregistered daycare centre as the front for a child porn production operation at a North Carolina home.

Elizabeth Holland Mills, 35,  faces up to 30 years in jail after pleading guilty to one count of manufacturing child porn following her arrest alongside four others in January.

In August, her husband Bailey Joe Mills, 34, pleaded guilty to the same charge after police discovered Facebook messages sent between him and a 12-year-old girl regarding payments for sex.

According to the New York Daily News, authorities said his arrest led to the recovery of videos and photos showing victims between the ages of one and 14 being sexually assaulted by adults at the property.

They also revealed that Mr Mills had billed himself as a baby-sitter, tutor and mentor at the rented private residence in Harnett County.

Speaking to the News Observer earlier this year, the couples' landlord Siegrun Collins said the Mills' had been renting the three-bedroom house for about 18 months at the time of their arrests.

She described Bailey Joe Mills as 'down-to-earth and chatty', and said he was unemployed, while Elizabeth Holland Mills had called herself an exotic dancer and paid the $750 monthly rent herself.

The three other arrests at the property included Rashawn Rodriguez Drake Jackson, 20, Jordan Everett Busse, 29, and Tommy Keith Wall, 50.

Bailey Joe Mills will be sentenced in January 2015, and his wife in February.
