There have been few opportunities to enjoy messing around at the seaside this summer.

So beachgoers were sure to make the most of a rare dry day during what looks set to be a Bank Holiday washout.

Thousands took to the waves at Woolacombe beach, Devon, yesterday afternoon.

Families and sports fans swarmed the sands, trying their hand at surfing, boogie boarding and kayaking.

Others sheltered from the brisk conditions by huddling behind beach umbrellas.

The Bank Holiday weekend had got off to a miserable start, with torrential rain for many places on Saturday.

Hull saw an inch and a half of rain – a fortnight’s worth – fall in an hour, with Kew Gardens seeing the same in a few hours.

The wet weather means this could be the wettest summer in a century, according to the Met Office.

Figures from selected weather stations show 335mm (around 13 inches) of rain has fallen between June 1 and August 23.

It looks set to surpass the most recent record – the 342.5mm (13½ inches) of rain which fell in 2007.

The summer of 1912 saw 384.4mm (around 15 inches) of rainfall.

This April to June was the wettest period since such records began in 1910, after the heavens opened when a hosepipe ban was declared. Now the summer – June to the end of August – is on track to be another record breaker, although the Met Office says the official figures will not be available until the end of the month.

Festival revellers in Reading, Leeds and Liverpool have had a soaking and raincoat sales were said to have soared by 50 per cent this weekend at Asda.

Yesterday, organisers of the Creamfields dance music festival in Cheshire cancelled the final day due to overnight wet weather soaking the site – disappointing thousands of fans.

Rain is expected to stream in from the West today following yesterday’s brighter weather, although the South East – where thousands will be attending the Notting Hill carnival – may escape it for most of the day.

Temperatures will reach only around 22C (72F), in contrast to the mini heatwave earlier this month which saw parts of Britain basking in 31C (88F) heat.

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: ‘Devon and Cornwall will see some of the worst of it, and Cumbria and West Yorkshire could see up to 40mm (1½ inches) during the day.

‘But for East Anglia and the South East it is likely to be dry and sunny start to the day, with rain only coming in later, about 5pm in the afternoon.

‘Dry days followed by showery ones looks like the pattern for most of this week, with a bright and breezy day on Tuesday and more showers on Wednesday.’
