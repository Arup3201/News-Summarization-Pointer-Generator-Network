A man arrested shortly after gunshots were fired near Vice President Joe Biden's Delaware home says police officers beat him up.

Rock Peters, 57, of Hockessin says New Castle County Police officers left him with a swollen nose, rib injuries, cuts on his face and a black eye. 

'They beat the daylights out of me,' Peters told the News Journal.

Photos that Peters says he took of himself afterward show his face covered with blood and bruises.

'They're lying through their teeth': Despite a damning police report, Peters says the police were the aggressors in his traffic stop and even likens himself to the unarmed New York man strangled by NYPD Eric Garner

Police documents say Peters fled from an officer near the Biden estate in Wilmington shortly after Saturday's shooting and scuffled with two officers.

The News Journal reports that Peters is not charged in the shooting. However, he does face charges of reckless endangering and resisting arrest. 

The police report claims the officers were about to let him walk away but he then yelled something at them and sped off, nearly hitting an officer.

When he was pulled over again, police say Peters reached into a jacket pocket and they feared he was reaching for a gun.

The scuffle soon ensued, but Peters says the lead up went nothing like what the officers described. 'They're lying through their teeth,' he told the News Journal.

'And that point, without saying a word, he cold-cocked me,' Peters recalled, and put a 'death chokehold on me. I thought I was going to die right there.'

Multiple gunshots were fired from a vehicle near Biden's Delaware home Saturday night. A man pulled over during a subsequent investigation claims he was brutally beaten by officers

Peters says he then yelled, 'I can't breathe to the police.' 

'Same thing that happened to Eric Garner, happened to me,' he said. 'It was deja vu all over again.'

Peters said he was taken to an area hospital to be treated and then to the police station.

At the station, Peters says his girlfriend took photos of his injuries. 

Police on Tuesday had yet to comment on Peters' allegations.

Shots rang out Saturday night outside the Delaware home of Vice President Joe Biden.

Multiple rounds were fired from a vehicle speeding past the New Castle County residence around 8:25pm, according to the Secret Service.

'This occurred on a public road outside the established security perimeter. The shots were heard by Secret Service personnel posted at the residence and a vehicle was observed by an agent leaving the scene at a high rate of speed,' Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback told CNN.

The Vice President and his physician wife were expected to be in Delaware over the weekend, but were not home during the incident, officials said.

According to CBS News, the couple was 'out for the evening.' 

The Secret Service informed them of the shooting and promised a thorough search of the grounds.

The shots were fired several hundred yards from the home. The road lies outside a perimeter secured by Secret Service.

According to the New York Times, New Castle County police and Secret Service agents were unable to catch the shooter as he or she sped away.

'The Secret Service is working closely with the New Castle County Police on investigating this incident,' Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service, told the Times.

Biden's neighborhood includes stately stone-and-brick homes along a curving two-lane road that winds through rolling hills. Nestled in a heavily wooded area, the vice president's home is not visible from the main road. A small cottage, occupied by the Secret Service, sits on the property near a gate in front of the driveway that is blocked off by Secret Service vehicles and personnel.

Police said there was a report of shots fired in the nearby area of Hoopes Reservoir, just northwest of the Biden home. The reservoir is a source of fresh water for Wilmington.

Biden's office said the vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, were briefed Saturday night, as was President Barack Obama. Biden's office referred all other questions to the Secret Service.
