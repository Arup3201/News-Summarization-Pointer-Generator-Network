Muslims attending an event in Parliament were told to use a bar as a prayer room, despite alcohol being forbidden by the Quran.

A damning complaint to Commons catering bosses also reveals staff ‘shouted’ at guests to get out with some not even given time to eat their food.

It is a hugely embarrassing revelation at a time when officials are hoping to raise more money by hiring out rooms in Parliament.

Blunder: Commons staff are under fire for suggesting a room usually used as a bar be set aside as a prayer room for Muslims

Alcohol is banned by Islam and some Muslims refuse to even handle it, fearing it can turn make them forget about God and prayer.

But an organisation which booked a reception in the Commons was appalled to find staff had set aside a room often used as a bar for champagne receptions.

The bungle was revealed after the serious complaint was revealed through a Freedom of Information request.

The email reveals anger at the bar being offered as a prayer room, guests being shouted at, food being taken away before it could be eaten and no provision for kosher food from the in-house kitchens.

The unnamed organisation was told to use Dining Room A, one of four overlooking the River Thames, as the prayer room.

The room offered as a prayer room is regularly used as a bar for drinks receptions

The room is next door to the main Stranger’s Bar, where MPs often drink late into the night.

The booking would have been made in the name of an MP. Hiring one of the rooms can cost around £750 for a few hours. The event was held on November 20 last year but was a disaster.

The email stated: ‘We had requested a prayer space for our Muslim guests, and I had explained at a face-to-face meeting that the bar was not appropriate for this.

‘Nevertheless, our booking form still stated that the bar was our prayer space.’

Staff were also accused of an ‘unacceptable attitude towards guests’.

The email added: ‘We did not appreciate the manner in which House of Commons staff shouted at our guests, both when instructing them to move into the room and when ordering their swift departure.

‘A warm welcome is an essential aspect of our events....so it was particularly jarring that our guests should be removed from the room without due politeness.’

Food was taken away 15 minutes before the event ended ‘with the result that some of our guests in fact did not manage to eat any breakfast at all’.

‘Our guests were then removed from the dining room five minutes before the event was due to end.’

One guest who had ‘number of allergies’ had no food prepared for her.

Kosher diners had to have food ordered in from outside caterers - at an additional £10 charge per person - as catering staff could not provide kosher food.

‘In short, our experience - and we understand from recent conversations that this is an experience shared by MPs, peers and their staff - is that the Houses of Parliament does not cater at all for religious dietary requirements, and that there are in fact charges and processes which appear to discriminate against those of particular faiths.’

The event was held in one of the rooms overlooking the Terrace where MPs and peers are often seen drinking and socialising

Today the House of Commons insisted it had dealt with the complaint quickly.

A spokesman said: ‘The House of Commons Banqueting team responded to the complaint by phone to ensure the issue was resolved quickly.’

She said that due to ‘sheer demand on limited facilities’, time and space were at a premium.

She declined to comment on why the Muslim prayer area was placed in the bar area or to comment on staff shouting at guests and telling them to leave the function before they had time to have their breakfast.

She added: ‘The House’s existing kosher food supplier was unavailable on this occasion so the customer was advised that they would be able to source their own supplier, which would incur the standard handling charge for external suppliers.

‘This charge was later refunded. The House Banqueting team has reviewed its Kosher suppliers to ensure we are able to source alternatives in the future.’
