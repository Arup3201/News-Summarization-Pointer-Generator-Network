A social media campaign with the hashtag #CoinForAustralia has been established by Indonesian Twitter users after Prime Minister Tony Abbott likened Australia's $1 billion in tsunami aid to the clemency bid for Bali Nine duo, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

The Twitter campaign, in which users have posted pictures of their donations to Australia, urges Indonesians to gather coins to return to Mr Abbott, after he suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'.

The backlash comes after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution, after linking the men's fate to Australia's aid donation following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia.

Furious Twitter users took to the social media site to display their donation to the refund campaign for Mr Abbott, claiming Indonesia does not need Australia's help and should not be indebted to the country.

'Take Back All Money & S**t You Gave Us!' one Twitter user said, posting a picture of a jar of coins. 

Another user said: 'Go to hell with your aid Bogan Oz,' alongside a picture which shows an elderly woman apparently collecting money for Australia at traffic lights in Indonesia.

'People will payback all u aid.We never ask for australia aid after tsunami,' a clearly angry man said. 

Julie Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians  Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful,Fairfax reported. 

Ms Bishop told The Sydney Morning Herald that she had informed Mr Kalla that the comments were not intended as a threat, and were instead an indication of the long friendship between Australia and Indonesia.

'I said I regretted if this comment was seen as anything other than that,' she said.

Indonesians have flocked to Twitter in anger at Tony Abbott's comments which likened Australia's aid donation after the tsunami to the clemency bid for the Bali Nine duo

The two Australians were convicted of smuggling heroin, a crime that carries the death penalty in Indonesia.  

Mr Abbott's comments sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'.

Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'.

'It undid a lot of the good work,' a source told Fairfax 

Sukumaran and Chan were due to be transferred this week from Bali to a high-security prison on Kambangan island ahead of execution, but that was delayed after appeals from Canberra that the men be granted more time with their families.

Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers  'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons,' without elaborating further.

Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island.

Indonesian authorities had already confirmed that Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, would be among the next group of death row prisoners to be executed, despite repeated appeals from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for their lives to be spared. 

Despite the delay, President Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead as planned.

President Widodo told Indonesian media on Friday afternoon that it was the nation's 'legal sovereignty,' and that the postponement was 'only about technical matters'.
