A Southern European themed estate boasting 122 acres of  rolling countryside and 39 acres of Shiraz, Cabernet and Semillion vineyard has become available, with a price tag of $30 million.

The estate named 'Sweetwater house' located in Pokolbin, Hunter Valley has been listed on Domain for sale by expressions of interest. 

With 10 years in the planning, the magnificent sprawled location reflects decades of Southern European architecture with antique European fittings and fixtures taking a year to source.

The $30 million property boasts 122 acres of rolling country and 39 acres of Shiraz, Canernet and Semillion vineyard

The property boasts high timber roofs and expansive living spaces 

Double marble basins are scattered throughout the villa with a rustic themed kitchen

Located on the site of Australia's oldest vineyards, Sweetwater's planning becomes justified after seeing the vine-covered balconies and pebbled driveway encircling a courtyard fountain. 

Every tile and brick were imported creating decorative ceilings, flagstone floors and a sweeping staircase.

It contains eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a rustic kitchen with a cast iron Aga stove, an open fire, timber ceilings, four Juliet balconies and double marble basins. 

Four Juliet french balconies line the property adding to its European charm

The $30 million was ten years in planning

Guests are placed in separate wings of the villa, away from the living and dining spaces.

Along with the acres dedicated to vineyards, the land contains six dams, adding to the visual appeal. 

The estate includes a wine cellar, day spa, manager's gate house, plunge pool and olive grove.

I has had interest primarily from Asia, however Australians are also showing some inquiry.

It also comes with approval for a function centre and additional accommodation.
