Paul Scholes believes Brendan Rodgers was too negative in his team selection for Liverpool's crucial Champions League tie against Basle.

Liverpool were sent crashing out of the Champions League after failing to beat the Swiss side at Anfield and stumbling to a 1-1 draw.

And Scholes said that the Liverpool manager Rodgers picked a negative team, leaving some attacking players on the bench.

In his Independent column, Scholes said: 'Last season I felt he (Rodgers) had a confidence about him, and would pick attacking, positive teams. His selection on Tuesday was nothing like that.

'Liverpool needed to blast Basle out of the way. Instead Rodgers left Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho on the bench. 

'It was a game he needed to win and yet he picked a midfield of Joe Allen, Jordan Henderson and Lucas Leiva – all solid players but more than two from those three and the side feels defensive.

Basle secured the draw they needed to beat Liverpool to second place behind Real Madrid in Group B

'At half-time he brought on a left-back, Alberto Moreno, and a winger, Lazar Markovic, who has done very little for him so far. 

'Then when he did bring on Coutinho, a No 10 to his boots – he even wears the number – he played the Brazilian in central midfield.'
