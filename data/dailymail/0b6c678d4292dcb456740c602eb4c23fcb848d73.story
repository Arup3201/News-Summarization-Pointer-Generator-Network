The grandparents of Cassidy Stay have spoken out to reveal how she is coping with the loss of her murdered parents and four siblings, and how they have found comfort in mourning with the alleged killer's parents who are their longtime friends. 

Ronald Haskell Jr stands accused of killing Stephen and Katie Stay, and four of their five young children last July in a rampage while searching for his ex-wife. 

Oldest daughter Cassidy was the sole survivor of the shooting at the Houston home, when a bullet grazed her scalp and she pretended to be dead.

Tom and Joyce Stay, Cassidy's paternal grandparents, had known the alleged killer since he was just a boy, attending the same close-knit Mormon ward in southern California with his parents, Karla and Ronald Haskell Sr.

In the six months since the tragedy, they have bonded with the parents of the alleged shooter, a family they have known for many years

In the wake of the tragic crime, the Stays reached out to their old friends the Haskells, knowing they too must be going through a trying time.

'And, indeed, we found they were sick and brokenhearted about everything. I told them, "Your son did this, not you,"' Mrs Stay told the Houston Chronicle. 'Our friends are as baffled by this whole thing as we all are.' 

They also point out that the Haskells themselves were also victims of their son's violent behavior. 

According to police reports, more than a week before the killings, Haskell Jr choked his mother and duct-taped her to a chair for hours - threatening to kill the entire family for speaking to his estranged ex-wife Melannie Lyon. 

'He was also mean to his father, who is in poor health - by purposefully tipping over his wheelchair while he was sitting in it. He did that more than once,' Mrs Stay said. 'Now his father cries all the time. He loved my son, Stephen.'

Haskell Jr remains in Harris County Jail on six capital murder charges. A date for his trial is pending while he undergoes mental health evaluations which will determine whether he pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, and if the prosecutors will push for the death sentence.

Mrs Stay remembers Haskell Jr as a 'good kid' in his teen years, before he moved with his parents to Alaska for his final years in high school. 

She can't understand what would have compelled the former homecoming king to commit such a gruesome murder. 

Investigators believe Haskell Jr traveled cross-country to find his ex-wife Melannie who recently divorced him and took out a protective order after being together for 12 years.

Katie Stay was Melannie's sister and helped her move to the Houston area to get away from her husband.

Haskell Jr donned a FedEx uniform to break into the Stay home on July 9, 2014 when only Cassidy and her siblings Bryan, 13; Emily, 9; Rebecca, 7; and Zach, 4; were at home. 

He waited until their parents got home to tie them up to chairs and shoot each in the back of the head. Cassidy only survived when the bullet intended to kill her only grazed her head and she pretended to be dead until Haskell Jr fled.

Shots fired: Haskell Jr barged into the home when only Cassidy and siblings were home. He then waited for the parents to come back to tie them all up and shoot each in the back of the head 

Surrender: When he left the home to track down his ex-wife, Cassidy called 911 and police surrounded him before he could kill more. Pictured above surrendering to police, wearing the Fed Ex uniform he used to break into the home

'She told us that she felt like angels were surrounding her. Like somebody held a hand over her mouth to keep her quiet. I hate to imagine what she heard and saw before she walked out of there,' Mrs Stay said. 

The brave teen quickly called 911 after he left, which helped police track Haskell Jr down and arrest him before he got to his ex-wife staying with her parents nearby.

Six months later, Cassidy is living with relatives and attending school in a suburb of Houston, and trying to live as normal a life as possible, hanging out with friends, attending church dances, football games and practicing her flute.

Mourning: Cassidy is now living with relatives outside of Houston. She just got a therapy dog for Christmas. Pictured above with her mother 

Her grandparents say she is obviously still traumatized by the shooting, but doing better with the help of a new therapy dog. 

For Christmas, she received a Rhodesian ridge-back puppy which can sense her mood and help calm her down. 

Also over the holidays, Cassidy got to see a memorial dedicated to her family near Spring, Texas.

As for Mr and Mrs Stay, their faith in God makes them certain that they will see their son and his family soon in heaven. 

'We are old. So, it won't be that long for us,' said Mrs Stay. 'It's like our son and his family are on a vacation.'
