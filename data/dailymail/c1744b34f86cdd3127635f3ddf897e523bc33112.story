Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old girl who underwent a double lung transplant after her family petitioned to get her on the adult donor list, has finally awoken from her medically-induced coma.

Sarah underwent surgery on June 12 and had been recovering ever since. A family representative announced today that Sarah was awake and communicative.

Tracy Simon said Sarah had been awake since Friday and was able to answer yes or no questions by nodding.

Progress: Sarah's parents say she has now recovered enough to be taken off oxygen, though she still gets support from a machine that helps her to breathe

According to Simon, Sarah's family are excited to see their daughter doing so well, but reports that Sarah is frustrated because a tube is keeping her form speaking.

Sarah suffers from cystic fibrosis, a disease which was killing her up until the transplant last week. Doctors had only given her a few weeks to live without new lungs. Since she was too young to be put on the adult donor list, she faced certain death since child donations are rare.

She is making rapid progress. Two days 
earlier she was taken off of a heavy-duty breathing machine and is now 
using a traditional ventilator.

Sarah's plight sparked a national 
debate over organ transplant policies, which until now barred children 
younger than 12 from the adult waiting list.

On June 12, Sarah's mother said that a set of lungs had become available for her daughter.

'God is great! He moved the mountain! 
Sarah got THE CALL,' a statement posted on her Facebook page read. 
'Please pray for Sarah's donor, her HERO, who has given her the 
gift of life.'

That afternoon, Sarah's mother spoke to a reporter from Fox 29
 about her daughter's searching, describing the family as being nervous 
but  'excited' about the surgery because doctors had given her child 
about a week to live, and they were out of options.

'We're just so thankful for the donor,' Ruddock Murnaghan said, adding that while it is a great day for her, it is not lost on her that it is a tragic day for the donor's family, who had lost a loved one.

The Murnaghans scored a
 major victory on June 6 when a judge ordered the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network to add the 10-year-old to the list for adult 
lungs.

On surgery day, Mrs Murnaghan said
 that had it not been for the judge's recent ruling, they would not have
 gotten this set of lungs, which likely came from an adult or teenager.

'Sarah would've been number 400 or something on the list,' she said.

The Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network added the 10-year-old to the list on Wednesday night after 
U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson's original ruling on June 5th..

The
 ruling applied only to Sarah, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis and has
 been awaiting a transplant at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

An expert has questioned the decision on medical and ethical grounds.

Lung
 transplants are the most difficult of organ transplants, and children 
fare worse than adults, which is one reason for the existing policy, 
said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone 
Medical Center.

Fears: Janet and Fran Murnaghan criticized the regulations that kept Sarah from getting an adult lung

He called it troubling, and perhaps precedent-setting, for a judge to overrule that medical judgment, and predicted a run to the courthouse by patients who don't like their place on the waiting list.

'I'm not sure I want judges or congressmen or bureaucrats trying to decide what to do with organs at the bedside,' Caplan said.

The Murnaghans said pediatric lungs are rarely donated, so they believe older children should have equal access to adult donations.

Holding on: Before the transplant last on June 12, doctors said Sarah had just a week left to live

Support: Sarah, who has been living in hospital since February, is pictured with her three younger siblings

Nationwide, about 1,700 people are on the waiting list for a lung transplant, including 31 children under age 11, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
