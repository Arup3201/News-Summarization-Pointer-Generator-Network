Raza Laskar, 32, admitted a string of sex offences against young boys and possessing indecent images

A paediatrician has admitted a string of sex offences against young boys including sexual activity with a child and possessing more than a million indecent images. 

Raza Laskar, 32, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, is charged with 31 offences committed against 12 boys after he was caught by police with a cache of vile child pornography.

Detectives raided his home after 1,600 files suspected to contain indecent photographs of children were made available on a file sharing site between Christmas Day last year and January 27.

Investigators from Greater Manchester Police linked the IP address to Laskar's home and a search was carried out on May 2, where officers seized a number of computers and data storage devices.

The force's high tech crime unit and an external firm, commissioned to carry out the work because of the large amount of data, found 1.2million images and videos.

During a search of the various gadgets they discovered chat logs and videos of Laskar engaging in sexual acts with a child, recorded in a hotel room he had booked.

Officers were able to identify other child victims Laskar groomed and incited to engage in sexual activity - some of them were based in the UK while others lived in foreign countries.

Before his arrest Laskar had worked in hospitals across Greater Manchester. 

Detective Inspector Theresa Carter of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Raja Laskar is a person who lived two very different lives.

'Like Jekyll and Hyde, he is vastly different in moral character depending on the situation, going from caring for and treating children to deliberately targeting, grooming and abusing them.

'He has admitted a vast number of appalling child sexual abuse offences and the size and the scale of this operation obviously came as a shock to the investigation team when you consider his background allied with the scale of his offending.

'His profession will obviously be an aggravating factor and one that many people will be extremely concerned about.

'While I can stress that we found no evidence that he committed any offence during the course of his employment, it will be of absolutely no comfort to the boys and the families of the boys he targeted online.

He admitted the charges at Manchester Crown Court today and is due to be sentenced in January next year

'The one thing I would like to highlight on the back of this is internet security and awareness.

'It is so important, in this digital age where even young school children have the internet in the palm of their hand that they know about the dark side of the web.

'There are dangers lurking if the right precautions are not taken and I would encourage parents to talk to their children and discuss what websites they are visiting, who they are talking to and what to do if approached by someone who asks them to engage in sexual activity.'

Laskar appeared at Manchester Crown Court today and admitted the charges, which include six counts of causing or inciting child pornography, one count of taking indecent photographs and eight counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

Among the charges are five counts of voyeurism and three counts of sexual activity with a child.

He will be sentenced on January 9 next year.
