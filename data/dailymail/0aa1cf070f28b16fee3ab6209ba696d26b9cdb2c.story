George Osborne faces an uphill battle to maintain Britain’s top notch credit rating next year following the release of data showing the economy is doing less well than hoped.

New government borrowing rose sharply to £17.5billion in November.

This suggests the Chancellor will find it hard to bring the total deficit for 2012-13 down to £80.5billion as projected in the Autumn Statement just two weeks ago.

Task ahead: The Chancellor may struggle to bring the total deficit down to the level projected in the Autumn Statement just a fortnight ago

Dampened: The Olympic-aided bounce in GDP in the third quarter has been downgraded slightly from 1% to 0.9%.

Sluggish growth has led to a shortfall in VAT and company tax receipts, as well as higher spending as welfare costs rise.

Office for National Statistics figures
show output in the third quarter expanded by 0.9 per cent rather than 
the 1 per cent previously reported.

Labour immediately attacked the Chancellor over the numbers, accusing him of using ‘smoke and mirrors in the Autumn Statement.’

Labour’s Treasury spokesman Rachel 
Reeves said: ‘These figures show that borrowing is rising and is up by 
10 per cent so far this year.’

However, the Government is likely to 
hang on to a glimmer of hope – the service sector, which represents as 
much as 70 per cent of national output, is improving.

A key survey shows that in October – 
the first month of the final quarter of the year – the services sector 
expanded and construction spending strengthened.

If this optimism held into November and December it is possible that a drop back into recession could be avoided.

Among the keys to whether another dip 
in the economy can be averted will be the Bank of England’s ‘funding for
lending’ scheme, designed to  bring down the cost and ease of home 
loans and credit for small and medium sized businesses.

If lending by the banks can be 
restored, momentum from the housing market and small businesses could 
keep the economy buoyant into 2013.

Much of the focus of the markets will be on the public finances.

All three of the major credit rating 
agencies have placed Britain’s ‘AAA’ credit rating, among the best in 
the world, on ‘negative watch’. A run of bad monthly deficit and debt 
numbers could push the UK over its own fiscal cliff.

Fitch reported that the Autumn 
Statement ‘weakened the Chancellor’s fiscal credibility’, Moody’s said 
it will reassess the ‘AAA’ rating in early 2013 and Standard & 
Poor’s has the matter under review.

However, market commentators believe 
the loss of the rating, while embarrassing for the Chancellor, would not
make much difference to the country’s borrowing costs.

This is because the UK is one of few nations with a credible plan to restore stability.

City economist Philip Shaw of Investec
said: ‘It’s another month of disappointing deficit data and it’s pretty
clear now that barring unexpected positive developments, the underlying
deficit will widen this year, compared with 2011-12.’

Analysts at Capital Economics warned 
if there was further slippage of the economy in 2013 the UK would 
‘possibly lose its AAA rating’.

So far this year the Government has borrowed £92.7billion – £8.3billion more than in the first eight months of last year.

However, the end-of-year numbers will 
be improved by several one-offs, including a contribution from the Royal
Mail Pension Plan, the sale of new mobile phone spectrum and a gain 
from the interest collected by the Bank of England on government debt.

The latest figures show the national debt – or the accumulated 
government borrowing over many years – has reached a record 
£1,083billion, or 68.5 per cent of the annual national output.

Mr Osborne had promised that by the 
time the Coalition leaves office in 2015-16 the national debt would be 
falling as a proportion of output or GDP. But the latest figures from  
the Office for Budget Responsibility show the first dip will not take 
place until 2016-17, when it will fall to 79.2 per cent of GDP, breaking
the government’s fiscal rule.

■ Italian prime minister Mario Monti 
resigned last night, keeping a pledge to step down after parliament 
approved his budget.  Mr Monti, a respected  economist, took over as 
head of a technical government last year as Italy’s borrowing costs 
soared. He is credited for steadying his country’s economy following the
premiership of Silvio Berlusconi.
