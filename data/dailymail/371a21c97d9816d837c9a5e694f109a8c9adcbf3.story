Two men have been arrested on suspicion of sexually exploiting children in Rotherham as part of an ongoing investigation into historical allegations.

The men, aged 35 and 39, were arrested today on suspicion of committing a number of sexual offences against underage girls between 1990 and 2001.

It comes after the Jay report earlier this year revealed that at least 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani origin, in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, between 1997 and 2013.

Today’s arrests were made after search warrants were executed at five properties in the Goole area of East Yorkshire.

Police said attempts are currently being made to transfer the men to South Yorkshire for interview.

The arrests come Professor Alexis Jay’s report into historic sex abuse in the South Yorkshire Town in which she criticised the way in which police and Rotherham Council dealt with complaints from teenage girls who said they had been raped and trafficked by gangs of mainly Asian men.

The controversy that followed the publication of the report led to a series of high-profile resignations including Rotherham council leader Roger Stone, council chief executive Martin Kimber and council director of children's services Joyce Thacker.

The most high-profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010.

He had defied demands from political leaders of all parties to resign and refused to see why he should take any blame before later having a change of heart and quitting ‘for the sake of the victims’.

South Yorkshire's chief constable David Crompton has also been under pressure to explain his force's attitude towards child sexual expolotation over the last 15 years.

Earlier this week, further details emerged of how police turned a blind eye to the horrific crimes and even blamed the young victims.

A number of incidents have now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which is investigating 14 former and serving police officers.

Two of the incidents referred to the watchdog involve police arresting the victims of reported abuse while no action was taken against alleged offenders.

In one case, a mother of an alleged victim was told it would breach her 13-year-old daughter's human rights to examine her mobile phone, following interactions with 150 Asian men.

The spotlight first fell on Rotherham in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators', were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex.

The five men - Umar Razaq, Adil Hussain, Razwan Razaq, Zafran Ramzan, and Mohsin Khan - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances.

One of the men branded his victim a ‘white bitch’ when she resisted, while a second smirked: ‘I’ve used you and abused you.'

The men, all British-born Pakistanis, attacked the four girls in play areas, parks and in the back of their cars, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

The damning Jay report published earlier this year revealed that at least 1,400 children were abused by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani origin, in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, between 1997 and 2013

They gave them gifts and introduced them to their friends. The girls were abused so frequently that after many months it ‘became a way of life’.

The girls, who were being monitored by social services, were eventually rescued by police and removed from their homes amid growing concerns for their safety.

In her report, Professor Jay said senior police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act, with staff reluctant to report their concerns out of fear of being called racist.

Children as young as 11 were trafficked, beaten, and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013, the council commissioned review into child protection revealed.

More than a third of the cases were already know to agencies, but according to Professor Jay: 'Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist'.

She condemned the 'blatant' collective failures by the council's leadership, concluding: 'It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered.'

Fears had also been raised by schools over the 16 years but the alerts went un-investigated.

Teachers reported seeing children as young as 11, 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in Rotherham or other local towns and cities.

The majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts, alcohol and drugs. Some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused.

Analysing the case studies, Professor Jay said many of the children came from dysfunctional families, had parents with addictions, and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child.

Anyone with concerns about child sexual exploitation should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
