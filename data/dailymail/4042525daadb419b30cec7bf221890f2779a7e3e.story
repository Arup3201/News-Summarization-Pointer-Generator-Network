Case review: Senior prosecutors have flown to Portugal to investigate fresh leads in the case of missing Madeleine McCann

Senior government lawyers have flown to Portugal to investigate fresh leads in the Madeleine McCann case, six years after she disappeared on a family holiday in the Algarve.

London's chief Crown prosecutor Alison Saunders and her deputy Jenny Hopkins travelled to Portugal with Scotland Yard detectives in connection with the force's review of the case, it has been confirmed.

The police review of the circumstances surrounding the little girl's disappearance has identified new 'people of interest' as well as fresh 'investigative and forensic opportunities', it has emerged.

Madeleine, who was then three-years-old, vanished from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3 2007, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends.

A CPS spokesman said: 'Prosecutors 
from CPS London, and investigators from the MPS (Metropolitan Police 
Service), visited their Portuguese counterparts on April 17-18 to 
discuss possible next steps in relation to the disappearance of 
Madeleine McCann.

'We continue to work with the police on this case.'

Operation Grange, conducted by Scotland Yard's Homicide & Serious Crime Command, was launched in May 2011 in response to a campaign by the McCann family.

It is the first time CPS lawyers have visited Portugal in connection with the Met's review of the case.

Last
month, Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell said the review 
has identified 'both investigative and forensic opportunities' and had 
identified 'more than a handful of people of interest'.

Those 'people of interest' are understood to include Britons and known child offenders who were in the Algarve at the time of Maddie's disappearance.

As
they marked the sixth anniversary of Maddie's disappearance last month,
Mr and Mrs McCann said they were encouraged by Operation Grange, and 
said police seemed 'more determined than ever'.

The
couple's hopes were further reinforced by the recent discovery of 
Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight in Ohio, a decade after 
they went missing in separate incidents.

When
the women were found, the McCanns said the rescue of the women 
'reaffirmed' their hope of finding their daughter, which has never 
diminished.

It has been
reported that Home Secretary Theresa May is set to announce a 
full-scale Yard investigation into Maddie's disappearance.

A
full investigation would allow police to interview suspects in Britain 
though they would seek the assistance of the Portuguese to carry out inquiries there.

A
Home Office spokesman said: 'The Home Office remains committed to 
supporting the search for Madeleine McCann and we have always said we 
would provide the Metropolitan Police with the resources they need to 
investigate her disappearance.'

The McCanns' spokesman Clarence Mitchell said they would not comment publicly while Operation Grange continues.

He
said: 'They remain grateful, however, to the UK authorities for the 
work being done to establish what happened to Madeleine and to bring 
those responsible for her abduction to justice.'
