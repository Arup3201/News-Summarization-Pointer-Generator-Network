She endures up to six hours of sexual arousal a day and once had more than 180 orgasms in just two hours.

But mother Cara Anaya-Carlis, 30, from Arizona said the rare condition which causes intense waves of pleasure is 'ruining her life' as she is house-bound and cannot work.

She was diagnosed with persistent genital arousal disorder three years ago and became reclusive after having spontaneous orgasms in the supermarket, on the school run and even in the playground.

After suffering an attack of 160 orgasms - not including multiple orgasms - in just two hours, Mrs Anaya-Carlis sought the advice of her GP who was left baffled

Mrs Anaya-Carlis, who has a 10-year-old son Merrick with her husband Tony, now avoids being in open spaces and is too embarrassed to tell a potential employer about the condition.

'It is embarrassing and confusing and humiliating,' she said.

'When you are around children you feel like a pervert because you have all these really strong feelings rushing through your body at the same time.

'So if imagine you can't help out in class or go on school trips because the kids don't understand, the parents don't understand.

'Even doing the school run is a worry because the arousal will build and build and I just have to stay in the car until it is over or try and mask it.

'It has devastated my involvement in my son's life because I feel too dirty to be a part of it. We want him to be a normal kid but at the same time he can't have friends around because mom has this condition.

'The worst thing is I can't explain it to him because he's too young.' 

She developed the condition suddenly while grocery shopping three years ago.

Walking through the store she suddenly found herself aroused by everything she saw, smelt and touched.

The mother-of-one began to panic and the arousal continued until she fell to the floor and orgasmed multiple times. 

'It was one of the most intense orgasms I had ever had and it was with no assistance,' she said.

'I was frightened and confused, I just ran out of the store and as I drove home I kept orgasming.

'This was the first time and it was six hours of constant build up and orgasm with just seconds in between. I was terrified.' 

She has tried everything to cure her condition including ice, cold showers, changing her diet and increasing her exercise regime, but nothing works.

The mother-of-one has learnt to control showing her arousal, but said it can really affect her mental well-being. 

'It makes me giggle because of the momentary high and outwardly I look okay but inwardly it's a torture.

Dr David Goldmeier, an expert on sexual medicine at Imperial College in London said: 'Persistent genital arousal disorder is a newly recognised condition, where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire.

'PGAD sufferers experience intrusive, unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting. This arousal can persist for hours, days or even longer.

'This can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm, this often doesn't help or can worsen the symptoms.

'Spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it's those women who can't control the arousal which is uncommon.

'I see around 20 women a year with this condition, it may be as common as one in 100 we just don't know.

'Sometimes it may resolve on its own, there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient.'

'It is ruining my life, because it messes with your head. You body is running on a high, on an up and down, so it really affects your moods.

'Some days when it's really bad I just want to shut the curtains and never get up.

'Other days I have little control over my body, and I will only have suffered 10 orgasms that day and I feel I could go back to work, get my life back.

'On a good day life goes on, a bad day it's disabling but I still have to pick up Merrick from school, be a wife to Tony and make the dinner.

'On a bad day it's like the cookie monster on cookies.' 

She suffered with her condition for months before it became too unbearable to handle.

After having an attack of 160 orgasms - not including multiple orgasms - in just two hours, Mrs Anaya-Carlis sought the advice of her GP who was left baffled.

Later, medical experts would identify the incurable condition, which causes dehydration, injured knees and ankles and ultimately exhaustion from lack of sleep. 

She has been unable to wear high-heels since developing the condition as she never knows when she will suffer an attack.

'You can't say to your future boss, 'I may not be able to come in today because I suffer from orgasms', he would think you were making it up,' she said. 

'But it isn't just the embarrassment it's needing a change of clothes, it's that moment if you have a bad one and your knees give way and you hurt yourself.

'You can't be a risk or a burden.' 

The condition has also put pressure on her marriage as  she craves affection, intimacy and physical contact because of the number of hormones in her body.

Before her spontaneous orgasms started, she had only climaxed with her husband and the couple had sex around four times a month. 

'We still have sex but it can become incredibly frustrating for both of us because I am forever aroused,' she said.

The mother-of-one said her relationship with her husband Tony has become more strained
