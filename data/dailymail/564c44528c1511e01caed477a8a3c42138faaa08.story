Generous readers have donated more than £92,500 to the Daily Mail's Christmas Appeal for Sue Ryder hospices.

The money will be used to help families as they cope with a dying relative's final days, whether in a dedicated hospice or with support at home.

The national charity provides a range of services including end-of-life care in hospices, nurses to provide pain relief at home and bereavement counselling for children.

Sue Ryder chief executive Heidi Travis said the Mail's support would make an 'immeasurable' difference to people's lives. 'We believe that towards the end of their lives everyone should receive the care they want,' she said.

'Most people would like to die at home or in a hospice, pain-free and surrounded by family and friends. Sadly this isn't always the case. Through readers' amazing response, we will continue to be able to provide care and support to people nearing the end of their lives in our hospices and local communities.

'Sue Ryder's vision is to make incredible care available to all, no matter where they live or what their circumstances are. The Daily Mail Christmas Appeal is a significant step towards making this a reality.'

Over our four-week appeal, the Mail highlighted the hospices' work in providing specialist care so families can be with loved ones in their last days.

The appeal has raised at least £92,500 and a spokesman said the total amount collected was not yet known. The total so far is enough to pay for almost 12,000 hours of end-of-life care in one of the charity's hospices.

It would fund more than 2,600 home visits from a Sue Ryder nurse to provide pain relief, or 4,600 bereavement counselling sessions for grieving children.

Sue Ryder also helps people living with long-term conditions in neurological care centres and provides support to their families to help them live at home.

More than 60 per cent of its funding comes from voluntary donations and the charity has warned it could not continue its work without such support.
