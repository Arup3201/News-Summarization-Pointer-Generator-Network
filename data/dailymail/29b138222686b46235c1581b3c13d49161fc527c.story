Police in Venezuela fired rubber bullets and water cannons at demonstrators last night as increasingly violent anti-government protests spilled over into a second month.

Protesters improvised masks out of plastic water bottles and threw Molotov cocktails in the eastern suburbs of the capital, Caracas, with between 20 and 41 detained - while residents elsewhere in the city celebrated Carnival on a national holiday.

Around 1,000 protesters gathered again today in the Santa Monica neighbourhood, banging kitchen pans, honking car horns and carrying placards declaring: 'I'm swapping Carnival 2014 for a free Venezuela!'.

Anger: Protesters improvised masks out of clothes and plastic water bottles and threw Molotov cocktails at police in the Venezuelan capital Caracas last night

Crackdown: The demonstrators are angry at rising violent crime, high inflation, food shortages and what they say is a harsh crackdown on peaceful protests

Unrest: The protests have raged for several weeks as President Nicolas Maduro accuses 'fascist' enemies of attempting a coup. This photo was taken on Thursday

Police have used water cannon and rubber bullets against the demonstrators, and 17 people so far have died in violent clashes since early February

Talks: Venezuela's foreign minister will meet UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday amid growing international pressure to break the deadlock

Debris: Stones and paint have been thrown against government barricades in Altamira Square, Caracas. Thousands have missed Carnival celebrations to protest

Drenched: Protesters yesterday. Opposition supporter Nora Duenas, 69, said today: 'I want democracy. I want us to be able to live together in a democratic country where everyone has the freedom to think what they want - but without Maduro, because he's too Communist'

Long-running: The stand-off has gone on for more than a month, with what began as a student movement expanding to other parts of society

Tension: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington could revoke visas and freeze assets of Venezuelans who have been linked to government repression

The country's foreign minister will 
meet UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday as pressure grows to 
halt the unrest which has killed at least 17 people.

Violence
 escalated after largely peaceful student marches on February 12, the 
nation's National Youth Day, as many vent their frustration at food 
shortages, soaring violent crime and inflation that hit 56 percent last 
year.

Demonstrators claim 
the authorities and supporting militants have cracked down hard on 
protesters with unprovoked attacks, and are demanding that several who 
they say were unfairly arrested are released from jail.

Socialist
 President Nicolas Maduro has accused 'fascist' enemies of trying to 
trigger a coup like the one which briefly ousted his predecessor Hugo 
Chavez in 2002.

U.N. 
human rights commissioner Navi Pillay has called for an independent 
investigation into the recent deaths, and said inflammatory rhetoric 
from both sides was unhelpful and risked escalating a tense situation.

'It is time for all sides to move beyond verbal aggression and towards meaningful dialogue,' he added.

Bottle: Afraid of an alleged crackdown by the authorities, protesters have taken to concealing their identity. The President forged ahead with televised peace meetings

Liberty: National Guard officers fire tear gas at demonstrators in downtown Caracas yesterday - with spray paint daubing Libertad (freedom) behind them

Horror show: The protesters have found their masks wherever they can, including at fancy dress shops. One said: 'There's not going to be peace until there's justice'

Split: The capital is divided, with many areas carrying on as normal including the massive slum of Petare, where street vendors continued to hawk their wares. 'The people of Petare are warriors - the people of Petare don't stop for anything,' said Yuly Chacon, a 27-year-old teacher. 'Those (protests) are the things of the wealthy areas'

Wildfire: The protests escalated after what began as peaceful mass marches on February 12, the country's National Youth Day

History repeating itself: Venezuela has been largely socialist for many years, but an alleged U.S.-backed military coup did briefly topple Hugo Chavez in 2002

Pride: Amid the violence, Venezuelan authorities say they have arrested eight members of the domestic spy agency on murder charges, as well as three national guard soldiers and three police officers. 'The state... has acted to punish [those] responsible for human rights violations,' said chief prosecutor Ortega Diaz

Clashes: Protesters struggled against the effects of tear gas last night. Between 20 and 41 were arrested by the authorities

Vigil: A protest was held today by Venezuelans living in Switzerland against what they say are grave human rights violations in their home country

Protection: Demonstrators have covered their faces with fabric and fashioned home-made shields out of sheets of corrugated metal

Wearing a gas mask to protect himself from tear gas canisters, a protestor throws an improvised Molotov cocktail towards National Guard forces yesterday

Hate figure: The protesters fashioned an effigy of President Nicolas Maduro today as a march passed through a residential neighborhood in Valencia, Venezuela

Fleeing: A protester runs from tear gas thrown by National Guard officers last night during the continuing protests in the Venezuelan capital Caracas
