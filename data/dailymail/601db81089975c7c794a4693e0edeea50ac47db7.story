Former First Sea Lord West said Britain needed to be very clear on its 'gameplan' in Iraq

Britain risks taking the ‘dangerous step’ of being dragged further into military action in Iraq, former top brass warned tonight.

A retired commander cautioned ministers to properly think out any attack against Islamist jihadists who have spread a reign of terror over huge parts of northern Iraq.

Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, spoke out after David Cameron said Britain would ‘use all the assets that we have’, including ‘military prowess’ and aid, to defeat Islamic State (IS) extremists.

The Prime Minister insisted the UK would not deploy ‘boots on the ground’ but the Government is considering increasing the number of fast jets based in Cyprus capable of launching air strikes against the fanatics.

IS, the extreme Sunni Islam group formerly known as ISIS, is seeking to build a so-called caliphate - a new Islamic state spanning Iraq and Syria.

The brutal terrorist group, which is linked to Al Qaeda, has carried out a wave of atrocities including beheadings, crucifixions and abducting thousands of women and children.

The RAF’s latest spy plane - the Rivet Joint – is already being used to carry out surveillance to help the US military identify potential IS targets and eight Tornado fighter planes at RAF Akrotiri, currently being used for surveillance, could easily switch to a bombing role. Nearly 200 Special Forces troops have also deployed to the region.

But Lord West, a military grandee, warned ministers to be aware of the ‘unintended consequences’ of a military campaign.

The former head of the Navy said: ‘We need to be very certain of our ultimate aim and we don’t seem to have great clarity of vision about what we are going to do there. It is very worrying.

‘There is always a danger of mission creep. We need to be very clear on our game plan - what, at the end, is going to make our nation and the globe more secure.

‘The problem with getting involved is there is no way you want to become fully involved. It would be a dangerous step to have troops on the ground.

‘But you look at what the Islamic State is doing and it is incumbent to do something. We should use limited military capabilities: reconnaissance capabilities, intelligence, possibly airstrikes and using Special Forces to mark targets for firing from drones.

‘The Islamic State is a huge threat to the region and we need to pushing for a very joined-up policy, dealing with our allies, getting people in the Middle East to get into line.

‘It does not help that Qatari money is pouring in to help Islamic State because they are Sunnis.

‘I don’t think some countries have fully grasped how dangerous the Islamic State is. We have got to get these people in a row.’

Lord West also hit out at the Coalition for making such deep defence cuts since coming to power in 2010.

The Ministry of Defence has axed nearly 30,000 troops, warships, spy planes and fast jets in a bid to save billions of pounds.

He said: ‘It is ironic that having had large cuts in defence spending over the past four years, and facing the distinct possibility of even more to come, that David Cameron is relying on the Armed Forces yet again.

‘He rightly says our forces are excellent – they are – but you can’t keep cutting, cutting, cutting military capability if then you want to use it.’

Defence Select Committee chairman Rory Stewart, a former coalition deputy governor in Iraq following the 2003 war, backed arming the Kurds, but warned that their fighting forces needed significant reforms.

He added: ‘It is not just a humanitarian thing anymore. Arming the Kurds is taking a military position against the Islamic State. But before we do any of this we need far, far more information.

‘The lesson, above all, of our last intervention in Iraq is we have got to focus on what we can do.’
