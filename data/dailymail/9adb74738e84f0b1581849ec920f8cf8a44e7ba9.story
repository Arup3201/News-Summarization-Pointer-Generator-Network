Sales of traditional British apples are being pipped to the post by a crisp, sweet interloper from the other side of the world.

As homegrown favourites such as Cox’s Orange Pippin and Granny Smith decline in popularity,  shoppers cannot get enough of Jazz apples from New Zealand, whose sales are growing faster than any other variety.

Demand for the Jazz, which was first grown commercially in 2004, has risen 89 per cent in four years, from 5,449 tons in 2009 to 10,320 in the past 12 months.

Sales: Demand for the Jazz has risen 89 per cent in four years, while sales of traditional favourites have fallen

In contrast, sales of Cox’s Orange Pippin, which was created in Buckinghamshire in 1825, have fallen by more than 30 per cent in four years, from 43,420 tons to 30,031.

The fall of the Granny Smith has been even greater, with sales down 40 per cent since 2009, falling 24,500 tons to 35,069.

In fact, the Jazz – a cross between the biggest sellers, the Royal Gala and the Braeburn – is becoming such a fruitbowl favourite that it is grown in orchards across Britain.

The Cox’s demise will be hard for traditionalists to swallow.

The sweet-smelling, juicy, orange-red apples have been enjoyed for generations, but they are difficult to grow and susceptible to disease, which makes them less profitable than modern varieties.

The New Zealand growers behind the Jazz carefully control who is allowed to grow the trees. In Britain, the growing licence is held by Worldwide Fruit, which began the world’s largest single apple plantation programme in this country in 2006.

Fall: The rise of the Jazz comes despite the fact that apple consumption in Britain has fallen for the first time in four years (file picture)

The £5million project means there are now 21 British Jazz growers. Some 340,000 trees have been planted, with another 275,000 to follow by 2018.

The rise of the Jazz comes despite the fact that apple consumption in Britain has fallen for the first time in four years, following a 15 per cent rise in prices.

Total sales in the year to the end of June 2013 were 491,000 tons, down by 32,000 in a year.

Gary Harrison, of Worldwide Fruit, said: ‘Consumer demand for apples is changing, moving away from traditional varieties.

‘Jazz offers the consumer a superior, consistently excellent eating experience, shelf life of over four weeks and an ability to purchase all year round if they wish to do so.

‘From a grower’s point of view, the returns per hectare exceed pretty much any other apple.’
