She is widely admired for her bold style rather than her bald style - but it almost seemed as though the First Lady had shaved off her locks when she appeared on Jeopardy. 

Michelle Obama made a guest appearance on the long-running game show to promote her 'Let's Move' anti childhood obesity campaign.

But while she was answering questions on healthy eating, some viewers were going online to ask whether the 51-year-old was now bald.

One Twitter user @crysyallewis60 wrote: 'Ooh why is Michelle Obama bald on jeopardy? When did this Happen?'

Another, Nicholle Cummings added: 'Michelle Obama looks bald on Jeopardy.'

Others pointed out that the First Lady was likely to have had her hair tied back with the camera angle obscuring her ponytail. 

One user responded to the confusion by saying: 'Seriously? Hair’s pulled back.'

Reaction: Twitter users went online to question whether the First Lady had chosen to shave off her hair

Some Twitter users pointed out that the First Lady (pictured in Cambodia over the weekend) was likely to have had her hair tied back with the camera angle obscuring her ponytail

Although Obama made her appearance on Jeopardy on Tuesday, it is not yet clear when the game show was taped - shows are often filmed months in advance, New York Daily News reports.

The website points out that she switched to a bob look in August 2013 telling Parade magazine: 'You know, it's hard to make speeches with hair in your face.' 

New York Daily News reports that Jeopardy and the White House had yet to respond to requests for a comment.
