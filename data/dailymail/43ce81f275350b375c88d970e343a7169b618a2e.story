Two of the three selfie musketeers, David Cameron and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, were reunited at an EU Summit today.

In December, a photograph of President Obama, David Cameron and Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, taken on the Danish President's phone, went viral.

The legendary picture was taken during Nelson Mandela's memorial service.

But today there were no iPhones in sight and no wide grins on their faces when the pair discussed the topic of Ukraine at an EU summit in Brussels.

Then: Barack Obama, David Cameron and Helle Thorning-Schmidt were all smiles when taking a selfie at Nelson Mandela's funeral

Now: There were no smiles on show when David Cameron was reunited with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt today during a signing ceremony with Ukraine at an EU summit in Brussels

Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt arrived with a smile on her face at the European head of states summit. Yet moments later her smile had vanished when engrossed in conversation with David Cameron

Although Mrs Thorning-Schmidt arrived at the summit with a grin on her face, by the time she had begun speaking to Mr Cameron, that smile had disappeared altogether.

After the picture went viral, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said she wanted to delete the image which she described as not particularly good.

But instead, Mr Cameron is said to have suggested that it should be auctioned off and that proceeds from the picture go to charity.

The meeting today was at a European Union conference where world leaders signed an association agreement in which they agreed to maintain closer relations with Ukraine.

The landmark political cooperation accord between the European Union and the Ukraine committed to the same deal former president Viktor Yanukovich rejected last November, a decision that led to his overthrow.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, EU presidents Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso, and the leaders of the bloc's 28 nations signed the core chapters of the Association Agreement during the EU summit in Brussels.

Soon afterwards, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation completing the process of absorbing Crimea into Russia, defying Western leaders who say the Black Sea peninsula remains part of Ukraine.

Today's deal commits Ukraine and the EU to closer political and economic cooperation.

Yet elements concerning free trade will be signed only after Ukraine has held a presidential election on May 25.

Mr Van Rompuy, the European Council president, said the agreement would bring Ukraine and its 46 million people closer to the heart of Europe and a 'European way of life'.

'(This) recognises the aspirations of the people of Ukraine to live in a country governed by values, by democracy and the rule of law, where all citizens have a stake in national prosperity,' he said.

Two sets of the documents were passed around the table for the EU's leaders and Yatseniuk to sign in a solemn atmosphere. Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Yatseniuk then shook hands and exchanged the documents to applause, witnesses said.

Mr Yanukovich turned his back on signing the EU agreement last November in favour of closer ties with Moscow, triggering months of street protests that eventually led to his flight from the country.

Soon afterwards, Russian forces occupied Crimea, a Russian-majority region in the far southeast of the country, drawing outrage and sanctions from the United States and EU.

Mr Yatseniuk urged European leaders to move decisively to contain Putin with economic pressure or risk the conflict - the most bitter East-West confrontation since the Cold war - spilling elsewhere into Europe.

'The best way to contain Russia is to impose real economic leverage on them,' he told reporters after the signing ceremony.

'I strongly believe ... the EU will speak in one single strong voice, defending the territorial integrity of Ukraine and protecting the EU itself because God knows what is the final destination, is it Ukraine or is it EU?'

Yesterday, EU leaders began preparations for economic sanctions if Russia expands its footprint in Ukraine, but no details were given on what measures the bloc would take.

Underscoring divisions in Europe, which have hampered its response to the crisis in Ukraine, French President Francois Hollande said late on Thursday that Kiev could count on tightening relations with the EU but not on membership.

'I have always considered that Ukraine should be associated with the EU. It couldn't aspire to be a member of the EU,' he told reporters.

Ukraine was part of the Moscow-dominated Soviet Union until 1991 and analysts say Putin considers Ukraine to be within Russia's historical sphere of influence.

David Cameron's expression was stern today when arriving at the summit in contrast to Mrs Thorning-Schmidt's wide grin

Some European policymakers have pushed the EU to open its doors to countries in the east as an incentive to reform and resist Russian pressure on those states to shun Europe.

But many EU governments, wary of goading Russia with which they have had major commercial ties, will not even suggest that Ukraine could one day join the bloc.

As well as the closer political ties, the European Commission has agreed to extend nearly 500 million euros (Â£418 million) worth of trade benefits to Ukraine, removing duties on a wide range of farm goods, textiles and other imports.

Once Ukraine has a new administration and signs a free-trade agreement with the European Union, it will have unfettered access to the EU's market of 500 million consumers.

That has the potential to strengthen Ukraine's shattered economy, but also runs the risk of provoking retaliatory steps from Russia, which has already imposed stricter customs checks on trade with Ukraine.

The other burden for Kiev is meeting the obligations that come with EU political association.

These include instituting changes to the rule of law and justice in a country long plagued by corruption and repressive governance, and adopting business and environmental standards that will require hard work and long-term investment to meet.
