Even famous baseball players need to pay their bills.

Alex Rodriguez faces a new challenge: He's being sued by his own lawyer.

Attorney David Cornwell's law firm filed papers on Monday in Manhattan federal court saying the baseball star owes more than $380,000 related to their work against his steroid suspension.

New York Yankees player Alex Rodriguez is being sued by his own lawyer for $380,000 in unpaid legal bills

David Cornwell is suing Alex Rodriguez for what may be up to half a million dollars in legal fees

As first reported by The Daily News, the
 firm also is seeking pre-judgment interest and attorney fees that could
 increase the amount to half a million dollars.

The New York Daily News reports that Rodriguez refused to pay his bill because Desiree Perez, the nightclub manager and ex-con who is one of Jay Z’s top advisers at Roc Nation, told him not to.

'Most recently, Mr. Rodriguez admitted that his advisers at Roc Nation, most specifically, Desiree Perez, instructed him ‘not to pay the invoices, and to make Gordon & Rees sue’ him,' the complaint says.

Perez was arrested in 1994 for trying 35 kilos of cocaine but later served as a cooperating witness for the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Spokesmen for Major League Baseball and the Players Association declined comment.

Rodriguez
 was suspended for the 2014 season as a result of a drug investigation 
by Major League Baseball. He has said he plans to rejoin the Yankees in 
2015.

Cornwall didn't succeed in shifting the blame from Rodriguez in the Biogenisis doping scandal by claiming that Rodriguez was supplied with drugs by the clinic.

Rodriguez
 admitted in 2009 that he used banned substances from 2001-03 while with
 the Texas Rangers, before baseball had penalties in place for 
performance-enhancing drugs.

Rodriguez has denied using them since.

Sports
 Illustrated reports that earlier this month authors Tim Elfrink and Gus
 Garcia-Roberts revealed that Rodriguez won his 2007 American League MVP
 award while being secretly allowed by Major League Baseball to take an 
anabolic steroid.
