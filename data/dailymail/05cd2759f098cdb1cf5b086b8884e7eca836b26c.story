The world's largest desk has been installed in the offices of a New York marketing firm at a cost of $300,000, and it even features its own Twitter account.

The desk is actually an architecturally designed installation rather than a solid state desk, featuring 1,100 feet of desk space.

The desk features plywood archways, cubbies and storage space, and is topped with an unbroken surface created by a continuous pour of resin, finished like a surfboard, where over 17 people can sit and work.

Never-ending: The desk is one single snaking surface, perfect for all different kinds of functions, from meetings to individual work

More a structure than just a desk, the architectural innovation has places inside of the rolling and undulating structure that hold meeting space and more private areas

The design was commissioned by the company to create an 'endless table' which features large meeting spaces, individual and group work spaces and shelter-like areas for semi-private chats, all on one desk in a large office space.

It was designed by architect Clive Wilkinson, 59, and was built into the office of New-York marketing firm The Barbarian Group last month.

The Barbarian Group said: 'It's a desk that we could all share, literally.

Slick: The surface is made from a single pour of resin, treated like the polymer of a surfboard

The desk does feature drawer space, but was built with the idea that most modern companies only need a place for an employee to rest their laptop

The desk is designed to promote teamwork and communication in a business that is supposed to thrive on both, with the unbroken surface allowing people to spread out and share ideas

'4,400 square feet of undulating, unbroken awesomeness to keep people and ideas flowing.'

Named 'Superdesk' the structure features a flowing surface which loops and connects to itself, including seven arches for multiple functions.

Mr Wilkinson said: 'The design will promote an open working structure, creating small villages within the undulating design.

Friendship required: While the desk does have private areas, it is designed with communication in mind rather than working individually in private

One of the desk's boardroom-style meeting areas, which is completely connected to the same desk as those working on the other side of the office

'Traditional desks are coming to an end, as less staff use paper and essentially just need a place to rest their laptop.

'With each employee having the option of a baby filing cabinet, which can store paper and slides underneath the desk, the Barbarian Group believe that their snaking workspace, as the Twitter account states, is "Simply the Desk.. Better than all the rest".'
