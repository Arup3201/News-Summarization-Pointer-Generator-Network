The Red Sox have claimed a historic victory in Boston - winning the first World Series at Fenway Park in 95 years.

Wednesday night's 6-1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals - clinching the national title in six games - is a soaring triumph for the city that was rocked six months ago by the Boston Marathon bombings.

In the aftermath of the bombings, Boston - and the entire nation - adopted the slogan 'Boston Strong.' When the Red Sox returned to Fenway five 
days after the attack for their first home game, many Bostonians saw 
baseball as catharsis.

After the win Wednesday, fans flooded Bolyston Street, the site of the bombings, and kissed the yellow marathon finish line. Some cried as they described how much the World Series win meant to them after witnessing the horror of two homemade pressure cooker bombs that killed three people and tore off the legs of many more.

Veteran slugger David Ortiz - the Most Valuable Player and the 
biggest hero of World Series win - noted the emotional significance of the victory for his city and declared, 'This is is for you, Boston. You deserve it.'

'We struggled early this year with the situation that all of us went through but because of Him we keep ourselves together and here we are enjoying the time, he said.

'First of all I wanna say this is for you Boston. You guys deserve it we've been through a lot this year and with the bombing and the struggle - this is for all of you.

'I know that it was going to be a special year and when we start rolling nobody ever stop the train.'

The win capped an emotional season for the Red Sox, one heavy with the reminder of the Boston Marathon bombings in April. Players wore 'Boston Strong' logos on their left sleeves and erected a large emblem on the outfield wall known as the Green Monster as a constant reminder.

Fans said the victory felt important - bigger than the team's previous successes.

'We needed this,' after the bombings, said Mark Porcaro of Boston. 'They were an easy team to get behind because they stood up for us when we needed them most.'

Bostonian Sam D'Arrigo said: 'Words cannot describe how I feel. This is what being a Boston fan is all about.'

During the post-victory press conference, second baseman Dustin Pedroia said: 'The stuff that happened to this city - and we wanted to do something special and we wanted to make people happy and proud of this city.'

Tom Werner, the chairman of the Red Sox, 
dedicated the victory as a 'tribute to all of the families who suffered 
through the marathon bombing.'

Tens
of thousands of jubilant fans flooded Boston's Inner Harbor around 
Fenway - crowding bars and even the finish line of the marathon, the 
site of April's bomb attacks.

The Boston Globe
reports that on Bolyston Street - where three people lost their lives 
and dozens of others were injured by pressure cookers bombs on April 15 -
revelers knelt down and kissed the yellow stripe in the middle of the 
road.

One man, tears in his eyes, smacked the finish line at the marathon and declared: 'I was here. I saw both bombs go off. I was here in '04. This is different. It's more,' according to Globe reporter Billy Baker.

Within an hour, the Boston Police Department tweeted: '7 people arrested for unruly behavior - don't be number 8.'

All Red Sox fans understood the significance of Wednesday night's win - and the 95-year curse that has been lifted on Fenway Park

In the midst of the celebration, Boston's mayor and other officials - wary of some of the rowdiest fans in sports - urged revelers to be safe.

Mayor Thomas Menino posted two tweets in 10 minutes urging fans to celebrate 'responsibly.'

This is the third world series win for the Red Sox in 10 years. The team broke the 'curse of the Bambino' - a World Series drought since 1918 - in 2004. They won again in 2007.

But, both of those titles were seized on the road at their opponents' stadiums. 

It was back in that cursed year 1918 - 
that the Sox last won a World Series in Fenway Park. The historic 
ballpark was just six years old then. Now it is the oldest stadium in 
all of Major League Baseball.

The Sox won the best-of-seven contest in six games - mounting a remarkable comeback since falling behind 2-1 in St. Louis.

As
the Red Sox made their run for the World Series, several prominent 
players swore off shaving until they won. The famously scruffy players 
kicked off a social media sensation with the tagline 'Fear the Beard.'

Boston's 2013 team wasn't always favored for such baseball glory. The 2012 Red Sox won fewer than half of their games and came in last place in their division.

The team fired the manager and started 2013 with a new coach - John Farrell. Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote: 'But here’s the reality, people: The 2013 Red Sox might be really bad.' None of the top baseball analysts picked the Red Sox to win the World Series.

The team rallied, though. Ortiz improved his hitting to become more dominant than he has been in years. It also doesn't hurt that the Sox poured $150million into paying players - the third highest in the MLB.

On Wednesday night, Shane Victorino, symbolic of these resilient Sox, returned from a stiff back and got Boston rolling with a three-run double off the Green Monster against rookie sensation pitcher Michael Wacha.

John Lackey became the first pitcher to start and win a Series clincher for two different teams, allowing one run over 6 2-3 innings 11 years after his Game 7 victory as an Angels rookie in 2002.

With fans roaring on every pitch and cameras flashing, Koji Uehara struck out Matt Carpenter for the final out. The Japanese pitcher jumped into the arms of catcher David Ross while Red Sox players rushed from the dugout and bullpen as the Boston theme "Dirty Water" played on the public-address system.

'We have a lot of players with heart. We probably don't have the talent that we had in '07 and '04, but we have guys that are capable (of staying) focused and do the little things,' Ortiz said.

'Our f***ing city!' Ortiz was defiant in his remarks after the game and thanks the city of Boston for sticking with the team after the bombings in April
