Twenty million homes have been warned of a hosepipe bans to cope with the worsening drought.

But these images taken today show how in
 some parts of the country how drought is not just a threat, it is 
already a stark reality.

Water companies in the South and East of England, where rainfall has been too low for nearly two years, are set announce restrictions affecting one in three homes in the UK. Other areas could soon follow.

The move follows months of concern about the arid conditions, which have seen rivers run dry and reservoirs at record low levels.

In some areas, this has been the driest winter since records began a century or more ago, and weeks of sustained rainfall would be needed to get levels back to normal.

However yesterday was the second hottest day of the year and the Met Office says most of this week will be sunny and dry. It is not forecasting any significant rainfall in drought-affected areas over the next month.

Anglian, Southern, Thames, South East and Veolia – which covers part of London and the Home Counties – are set to bring in bans which will start in two to four weeks, according to insiders. The companies have a total of around 20million customers.

Portsmouth Water and Sutton and East Surrey Water may also announce restrictions this month.

The warm weather is set to continue this week with temperatures hitting 17 degrees - five degrees up on normal and hotter than parts of Greece.

Met Office forecaster George Goodfellow said it was set to be sunny and dry with similar temperatures throughout the week.

Mr Goodfellow said: 'A band of high pressure coming from the north-west will stay with us this week bringing with it a spell of warm weather.

'Temperatures will get up to 17 degrees across the country which is pretty warm for this time of year.

'The average temperatures are between eight and 12 degrees (46F to 53F). One or two places could get even warmer than that, particularly in the south east.'

He added there could be a chance of 
frost as the temperatures cool down overnight but said on the whole the 
next few days will remain mild.

'We won't really see anything much in the way of significant rainfall.'

Currently 14 counties in the South, the East and the Midlands are officially in drought. Tomorrow’s announcement coincides with an Environment Agency report which will add the rest of the Midlands and Yorkshire to the area at ‘high risk’ of summer drought.

The first step companies can take is restricting the use of hosepipes and sprinklers for washing cars and watering gardens. Those who flout a hosepipe ban face a £1,000 fine.

Caps on non-essential business use such as watering golf courses, cleaning pavements and car washes could follow.

There are fears that the restrictions could affect this summer’s Olympic Games and officials are said to be drawing up contingency plans.

An Environment Agency spokesman would not comment on when water restrictions could be introduced but said: ‘Hosepipe bans are very effective at cutting water usage, especially in the summer months, as 50 per cent of water use is domestic.’

Levels of groundwater – which is needed to fill underground aquifers – are low at three-quarters of sites measured by the Environment Agency.

Reservoirs at Ardingley in West Sussex and Bewl in Kent are ‘exceptionally low’ at just 41 per cent of capacity, although some rivers returned to normal levels after rain last week.

Helen Vale, national drought co-ordinator at the agency said: ‘Although river flows have increased slightly, the water underground is still exceptionally low for this time of year. Everyone must play their part by using water wisely.

‘Our drought prospects report will provide the outlook for water resources over the summer and what that will mean for abstractors, wildlife and public water supplies.’

The past months have seen fish dying in low rivers, cereal and potato crops affected, and wildlife habitats destroyed.

Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, parts 
of Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire and west Norfolk have officially 
been in drought since last summer. Last month the South East was also 
declared to be in drought. This includes London, Berkshire, Oxfordshire,
 Hertfordshire, eastern Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, Hampshire, East 
and West Sussex, Surrey and Kent.

Anglian Water has seen the lowest rainfall, receiving just two-thirds of the long-term average last year.

Spokesman Ciaran Nelson said 
yesterday: ‘We’re prepared for dry weather here in the east but we could
 never have anticipated the incredibly low rainfall that has left rivers
 at such low levels, and prevented us filling our reservoirs at the time
 of year when we need them to be topped up. To recover from a situation 
like this will take months of persistent rain.’

Southern Water said it had had the driest ten months since 1888.

A Thames Water spokesman said: ‘We can’t make it rain but we can do our bit to use a little less water.

‘Switching
 off the tap while brushing your teeth saves six litres and a minute 
less in a shower saves ten.’ Veolia Water said: ‘The last eighteen 
months have been exceptionally dry, so we really are seeing challenging 
times.’

While south, 
eastern and central areas have seen low rainfall, in the north west, 
parts of the west and Scotland it has been plentiful over the past few 
months with rivers bursting their banks.

Alex
 Neil, the Scottish Infrastructure Secretary, wrote to UK ministers last
 week offering to provide drought-hit England with water.

He
 said: ‘With Scotland’s plentiful supply of water and superb industry 
expertise, it is only right we offer our assistance in the long term,’ 
although he conceded there were ‘huge logistical issues’.

Fire crews in drought-affected areas have been asked to cancel charity car washes, which raise tens of thousands of pounds.

Meanwhile, the weather has claimed a casualty - in the shape of Scotland’s ski season.

The
 Scottish Children’s Ski Championships have been cancelled due to a lack
 of snow - and it is feared there will be no more skiiing this season.

The
 event, which was due to take place this coming weekend at CarinGorm 
Mountain, was expected to attract around 200 competitors.

Snowsport Scotland said that of about a dozen children’s alpine races planned this winter only one had run.

None of Scotland’s five resorts were operating today and are not expected to re-open for snow sports this season.

Lack of snow, mild weather and the strong winds have all been blamed for the lack of skiers on the pistes.

Last year the season ended in mid-April and in 2010 it finished incredibly at the start of June. This year the last skiing was on February 26.

'It is unlikely there will be any 
more skiing this year. Even by Scottish standards it’s an unseasonably 
early end to the season. March is a month we have had very good skiing 
in previous years,' said CairnGorm Mountain spokesman Colin Kirkwood. 
'We have been doing snow dances for weeks but it hasn’t worked.

'Unless there is a sudden drop in temperatures and a big snowstorm - which is not forecast - that is it for this year.'

Only
 44,783 skiers and snowboarders had been logged at CairnGorm so far this
 season compared to 96,431 at the same time last year.

'It
 looks like the season is over,' said a spokesman for Snowsports 
Scotland. 'High temperatures and strong winds have just melted and blown
 away what snow there was.

The
 Scottish Children’s Ski Championships will not be held - it is a pity. A
 lack of snow has meant we have only been able to run one race this 
year.'
