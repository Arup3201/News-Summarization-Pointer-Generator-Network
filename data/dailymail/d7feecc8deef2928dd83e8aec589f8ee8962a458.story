Saturday night, and it was light entertainment time, with the World Cup version of It’s A Knockout. This time around, it was the BBC’s chance to introduce the boys from Brazil as the opening act after ITV had the honours on the opening day.

Back then, Auntie had Thierry Henry as one of her main strikers.  But he has now lost his place alongside Gary Lineker. With a philosophical gallic shrug - which basically said ‘I have no idea why the MLS season is starting up again during the World Cup?’ - he said adieu last week, and went back to training for his club in New York.

Off the bench has come Alan Hansen. Enjoying the kind of finale to a career most of us could only dream of. Three weeks by Copacabana beach being slightly more memorable than some warm wine and nibbles in the office, I’d venture to suggest.

For the occasion, he went with a rather sombre black shirt. But this was the only dark note in a quite riveting two hours or so of telly. Even if the last Englishman on the field of play in Brazil very nearly became the big story.

The camera seems to really love Howard Webb. Or perhaps it’s the other way around? Either way, his already melodramatic performance suddenly took centre stage when he disallowed Hulk’s second-half goal. Now, if this were domestic coverage of the game, the following few minutes would have forensically picked the moment apart. While also giving us relentless up close and personal looks at Webb and his partner-in-crime with the flag, Mike Mullarkey.

But just as Guy Mowbray was telling us us on commentary that Brazilian ‘heads are turning to monitors’ on the bench to see the damning images, so the world was being shown a substitution rather than the moment of the match. Which can often be par for the course with this kind of international event telly coverage. Because when the pictures are being used by an abundance of broadcasters, the safest option is to provide more neutral pictures, tempered with plenty of surrounding colour. Spectacle over specifics.

Nevertheless, this sense of occasion can actually also make a moment really special. Such as with the epic penalty shoot-out. This was truly marvelous sport on the telly. Firstly, because the scatter gun images captured so much tension and emotion. And secondly because the BBC stuck with those shots, and had the studio provide fabulous voice-overed insight (‘I was next in Moscow’, shuddered Rio Ferdinand at the thought. ‘And my legs had gone’) into the intensity and pressure of the situation on the players. Formidable, memorable stuff.

Later that evening on ITV, it was the part two of the evening’s entertainment. And clearly Adrian Chiles and the boys had got all their clothes back from the dry cleaners. Because there they were at the top of the show, by the beach, giving the casual wear a run out.

Ian Wright the only man adding a touch of decorum to the whole sorry shorts ‘n’ sandals affair by sporting a splendid panama hat.

While at half-time, they were back in the studio, but now dressed like they were all set to hit happy hour as soon as the game finished. Although if the final whistle blew and we came back to them all in pyjamas, I also wouldn’t have been surprised.

Somewhere in the middle of all this, of course, Columbia had seen off Uruguay with very little effort. And delivered the goal of the tournament so far, in the process. But with that goal came something of a conundrum over at ITV. All based around the scorer of the goal, Rodriguez.

In the build up to the game, Wrighty went in hard on the pronouncing of his first name, spelt simply James. Hah-mez, said Ian with a real flourish. Which seemed to meet with the approval of both Lee Dixon and Martin O’Neill alongside him. However, on commentary, Clive Tyldesley was having none of it. Indeed, when Rodriguez rattled in his wonder volley, he even added a fee extra ‘a’s’ to the very familiar pronouncing of James.

Adrian then added fuel to the fire at half-time. After Ian said of the goal he could ‘watch it all day’, Adrian suggested he also thought Rodriguez ‘calls himself Ham-Mez’. Then added that perhaps after that goal, all the other James’s out there might want to follow suit?

In which case, I’d just like to say to Hah-Mez May, Hah-Mez Blunt and perhaps even Bond, Hah-Mez Bond - great stuff so far, isn’t it? Even if Clive still thinks you are still all plain old James’.
