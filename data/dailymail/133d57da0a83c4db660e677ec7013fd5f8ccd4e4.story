Jailed: David Kwiatkowski, a former travelling lab technician, reached a plea agreement after being accused of infecting dozens of patients with hepatitis C through contaminated needles

A hospital technician who knowingly infected 47 patients with hepatitis C has reached a plea agreement that will jail him for around 30 years instead of the nearly 100 he could have faced if convicted in a trial.

The travelling technician is accused of using hospital painkiller syringes and returning the contaminated devices to the shelf. He told investigators he had been stealing 
drugs for more than a decade and was 'killing a lot of people,' 
according to the plea agreement filed Monday.

Without the agreement, David Kwiatkowski
faced prosecution in the states of New Hampshire, Kansas, Georgia and 
Maryland. The document, drawn up by prosecutors in a New Hampshire federal court, 
revealed that across these states Kwiatkowski had infected patients with the same strain of the virus that he had.

The document also contained new revelations that he was fired from two Michigan hospitals and resigned from two others before beginning his traveling temp career.

Thirty-two patients in New Hampshire 
have been diagnosed with the strain of hepatitis C carried by 
Kwiatkowski, who worked at 18 hospitals in seven states before being 
hired in New Hampshire in 2011. There have been seven cases in Maryland,
six in Kansas and one in Pennsylvania.

One of the Kansas patients has died, 
and hepatitis C, a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver 
disease and chronic health issues, played a 'contributing role,' the 
plea agreement said.

The plea agreement includes details of
an interview Kwiatkowski gave investigators in New Hampshire after his 
arrest in which he said he knew he'd been diagnosed in 2010 but 
continued to 'swap out' syringes of the painkiller fentanyl.

He said he had been stealing drugs 
since 2002 and estimated that he had swapped syringes at least 50 times 
in New Hampshire, at least 30 times in Georgia and more than 20 times in
Kansas. Under the plea deal, Kwiatkowski would avoid criminal charges 
in the latter two states.

Kwiatkowski has been jailed since his arrest in Massachusetts in July 2012, when he was  accused of stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital's cardiac catheterization lab, in New Hampshire, and replacing them with blood-tainted saline.

If convicted at trial, he could have been sentenced to up to 98 years behind bars. He agreed to plead guilty to 14 federal drug theft and tampering charges he faced in exchange for a lighter sentence of 30 to 40 years in prison.

Kwiatkowski's attorneys did not immediately respond to emails or a phone message left at their office Monday night. A hearing on the plea agreement is set for Wednesday.

Linda Ficken, of Andover, Kansas, is among those Kwiatkowski is accused of infecting. Ficken, 71, said Monday she's glad he pleaded guilty but wishes the sentence were longer.

'It should've been life, since he gave us potentially a death sentence,' she said.

More than a year after Kwiatkowski's arrest, Ficken said, she is still angry at Kwiatkowski and at the system that let him move from job to job after he was fired over allegations of drug use and theft.

After Kwiatkowski's arrest, two of his previous employers confirmed that he had been fired over drug allegations. But several new incidents emerged in Monday's court filing.

According to the plea agreement, Kwiatkowski was fired from a Michigan hospital in 2004 after failing a drug test and was fired from another that year for gross misconduct. He resigned from two more Michigan hospitals while under investigation for drug use.

Plea agreement means he will serve around 30 years in jail - far less than the 98 years maximum sentence if convicted at trial in each state
