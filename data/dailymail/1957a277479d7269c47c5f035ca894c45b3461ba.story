Diego Costa took another step closer to confirming his £32million move to Chelsea on Saturday night after claiming 'it looks like' he is set to join Jose Mourinho's side.

As Sportsmail revealed on Thursday, everything is in place for the Spain international to move to Stamford Bridge and Costa has spoken out about the transfer for the first time.

Speaking after Spain's 2-0 friendly win against El Salvador, Costa told AS: 'Am I going to Chelsea? It looks like it.'

Agreed: Diego Costa has revealed his £32m move to Chelsea is likely to happen

Chelsea have already Costa's £32m buyout clause and have become frustrated with Atletico's attempts to delay rubber-stamping the deal.

A Chelsea source said: 'Chelsea have made an offer to Atletico Madrid in compliance with the buyout terms in Diego Costa’s contract, and Chelsea have been advised that the player has provided notice to Atletico Madrid invoking the buyout clause and directing the club to accept Chelsea’s offer.

'Chelsea looks forward to entering into formal transfer documentation with Atletico Madrid as soon as possible so that the player can concentrate on the World Cup.'

Costa, who missed Spain's friendly against Bolivia on May 30, started for Vicente del Bosque's side on Saturday night and was heavily involved in their last game before the World Cup.

Key man: Costa put in an impressive performance during Spain's 2-0 win against El Salvador

The game was less than five minutes old when he got behind the defense to chase down Xabi Alonso's long ball and was taken down by Henry Hernandez near the top of the box.

The penalty was given, but Cesc Fabregas failed to take advantage when his spot kick sailed over the crossbar.

Costa went on to have several more of his team's scoring chances. None was better than his point-blank header that was somehow saved by the outstretched right hand of the leaping Hernandez in the second half.

The 25-year-old nearly played a part in Villa's first goal in the 60th minute. When Alonso crossed to Sergio Ramos, Hernandez committed himself to the ball and left the net open.

Ramos headed the ball back to the middle, and Costa swung his right leg high for a sure-fire strike - but Villa barely got there first and headed it in.

Costa was subbed for Xavi Hernandez in the 74th minute. With the leg looking fine, the final step is to get back in full game shape.

'It was good to get rid of the fear I had,' Costa said through an interpreter after the match. 'I am not 100 per cent, but about the injury, it is clear that I am very well, that I am better. So this week I must work hard.'
