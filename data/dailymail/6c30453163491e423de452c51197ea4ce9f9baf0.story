A Serbian heart doctor appears to have set a few pulses racing after winning a medal in a bikini competition.

Trainee cardiologist Maja Pavlovic, 23, reportedly won the medal in the European leg of the Women's Bikini Fitness Contest in Spain.

Not content however with being a medical student and a beauty contestant, Ms Pavlovic is also a politician for the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS).

She was elected as a councillor in her home city of Cacak in southern Serbia, and says she hopes to develop her political career alongside her work in medicine.

Ms Pavlovic is currently in her fifth and final year of medical school in the central Serbian town of Kragujevac and is now practising on patients as part of her final exams.

According to daily tabloid newspaper www.telegraf.rs, which commissioned these pictures: 'People want to get sick on purpose just to get healed by her, and turning up specifically to ask for her despite the fact that she is still only a junior doctor.'

Ms Pavlovic said: 'I love medicine and I want to achieve great results there.

'But I also love politics. I want to stay involved in that and of course through my beauty contest involvement, I hope that I will get to travel and see interesting places.' 

The final of the contest is to take place between October 17 and 20 in Montreal, Canada.

Until then however, Ms Pavlovic will no doubt be kept busy with a full schedule at the surgery where she is working and a full list of political engagements.
