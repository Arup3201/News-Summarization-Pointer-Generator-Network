Betty Yates was found dead at her home in the picturesque town of Bewdley, in Worcestershire, which sits on the River Severn

A message on Facebook 
suggests a woman knows who killed a retired teacher found stabbed at her
riverside cottage, police said yesterday.

Detectives revealed they want to 
trace the woman, using the name Katie Eldridge, who posted the message 
on a memorial page on the social networking site for 77-year-old widow 
Betty Yates.

The message read: ‘She wasnt meant 2 b
home, the lad panikd and stabd her cus she told them off 4 bein in her 
house. It was meant 2 b a clean sweep but  she was home, she didnt stand
chance.’

Mrs Yates was found dead in the 
living room of her £300,000 home in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on 
Wednesday morning. Police believe she could have been the victim of a 
botched break-in.

Detectives said the message was 
removed from the page – called ‘RIP Betty Yates, the best teacher there 
was’ – before they were made aware of it.

But they said it was a line of 
inquiry they were pursuing and they were keen to find Katie Eldridge, 
whose message carries a picture of a dog or wolf-like creature.

Mrs Yates’s family joined police in a renewed appeal for information yesterday.

Her children, Hazel and David, 
described their mother as ‘vivacious, independent, popular and a true 
lady. She had a lovely character’.

Detectives are investigating the 
possibility the 77-year-old grandmother died tackling a burglar at her 
home in a beauty spot popular with walkers and anglers.

She died in the living area of the 
cottage, which lies at the end of a mile-long track between woodland and
the Severn near Bewdley in Worcestershire. Officers recovered a knife.

Friends had urged the retired teacher
to leave the isolated £300,000 property following the death seven years
ago at 71 of her husband, Raymond, a consultant engineer.

They described her as independent and feisty and liable to ‘put up a good fight’.

West Mercia Police said Mrs Yates had
been subjected to a violent attack at some point between Monday and 
Wednesday, when her body was found.

A local man told yesterday how he had
overheard one policeman close to the scene say ‘it appeared as if it 
was a burglary gone wrong’.

He added: ‘It looks like the woman fought the burglar but was killed as a result. It’s tragic but sadly a sign of the times.’

Mrs Yates was a member of the Wyre 
Forest branch of the University of the Third Age, an educational group 
for retired people, and ran the group’s book club.

Jeanne Round, a fellow member, said: 
‘She was a lovely lady. She used to get books out of the library for us 
and we would all go round to her house by the river to discuss them.’

Another neighbour, Lynne Marshall, 
said: ‘I know that friends had tried to urge her to move closer into the
community because she was so isolated where she lives but she always 
refused.

‘She said her memories of her time 
with Ray were in the house and she didn’t want to lose that.Betty still 
drove her car and went to art classes, she was very fit and feisty and I
would say she probably put up a good fight.’

Mrs Yates was known locally as ‘Beautiful Betty’ in tribute to her good looks in her youth.
Last night the track leading to her property remained sealed off as police continued to search the surrounding woodland.

The Geopark Way long-distance trail, 
which runs for 109 miles from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to Gloucester, is 
signposted down the track from the main road.

Detectives have set up an incident 
room at Stourport police station, with more than 40 staff on the case. 
Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson, who is leading the 
investigation, confirmed Mrs Yates had been killed with a knife.

He added: ‘The lady who died was subjected to a violent attack and we are determined to catch the person or people responsible.

‘I would urge anyone who has any information at all that could help our investigation to come forward without delay.’

Three police vehicles could be seen near the cottage and six more were parked beside the Severn in the track off Dowles Road, near the remains of a disused railway bridge

Mrs Yates’s elder sister, Joan Church, 79, described her as a ‘wonderful, wonderful sister’.

Mrs Church, who lives near Ludlow in Shropshire, added: ‘I’m so proud to have known Betty.

There’s nothing more I can say, except I am absolutely devastated.’

Hazel Costello, a 53-year-old 
solicitor who is one of Mrs Yates’s two children, was too upset to 
comment on the tragedy yesterday at her country home outside Stafford.

Mrs Yates taught for many years at St John Church of England Middle School in Blakebrook, Kidderminster.

Former pupil Verity Worthington said 
teaching was her passion: ‘She had a way with children – she didn’t just
teach us, she loved every single one of us, as we did her.

‘She encouraged us to read, to knit, 
and to think outside the box. Betty had a great sense of humour – she 
was gentle and loving, yet witty and funny.

‘She
loved where she lived, in a cottage on the outskirts of Bewdley, where 
she had the memories of her husband, Ray. She missed him tremendously, 
yet doted on her two granddaughters and always talked of them with 
pride.’
