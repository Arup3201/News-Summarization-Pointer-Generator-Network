However brief this World Cup has proved for England, it is developing rather nicely for Manchester United.

Undeniably so, given the bond that appears to exist between Louis Van Gaal and Robin Van Persie here in Brazil. A bond between coach and captain that has been central to the success the Dutch have so far enjoyed, first in crushing Spain and then seeing off a spirited Australia team.

What is good for Holland is also, you would imagine, going to be rather significant for United.

Loyalty: The Dutch manager Louis van Gaal is set to take over at Old Trafford after the tournament

‘I’m sure with Van Gaal and Robin great things are going to happen at Old Trafford,’ observed Dirk Kuyt after Holland’s 3-2 defeat of the Australians in Porto Alegre. ‘Unfortunately,’ the former Liverpool forward then added with a smile.

It is a fascinating dynamic, and one that goes someway to exploding the myth that United’s new manager rules only with an autocratic approach.

The truth is that as well as consulting Van Persie on the tactics for the Dutch team, he has even sought his opinion on when it would be appropriate to invite the players’ families to the team hotel.

Such dialogue might be something that concerns Wayne Rooney when he likes to be ‘the big man’ but it is likely to be a source of encouragement for the United players who were slightly baffled by the way David Moyes indulged the England striker when Sir Alex Ferguson had lost complete patience with him the previous season.

Moyes would probably agree he gave Rooney too much attention, given how disaffected his treatment of the 28-year-old is thought to have left individuals like Van Persie.

As Ferguson revealed in his autobiography last year, he grew increasingly frustrated with Rooney on a number of fronts. Most notably with the way Rooney’s ability could be ‘swallowed up by a lack of fitness’, adding that he had  ‘lost some of his old thrust’.

He also confirmed that he had indeed had to reprimand him for turning up at Carrington on one particular occasion in no fit state to train.

The relationship between Ferguson and 
Rooney began to erode as far back as 2010, when Rooney handed in a 
transfer request. Ferguson covered the episode in great detail in the 
same autobiography, just as he confirmed that Rooney had asked to leave 
for a second time, albeit verbally, towards the end of the 2012/13 
campaign.

Understandably, 
the players were more inclined to side with Ferguson and it meant they 
were somewhat disappointed to see Moyes’s making Rooney the focal point 
of the team when that role had been occupied by Van Persie the previous,
 championship-winning season.

With
 Van Gaal now coming in, Van Persie’s status is sure to be restored. In 
fact there is every chance he will be made club captain.

This
 is not to say Rooney will be ignored. On the contrary, Van Gaal knows 
Rooney remains a talented footballer. But he would have also noted how 
Van Persie has comfortably upstaged his club colleague at this 
tournament, even if Rooney was among England’s better players against 
Uruguay.

It sure to lead to a
 culture change at United, with the  Dutch calling the shots in a 
collective effort to guide United back to the summit of the English 
game.

Together Van Gaal and Van Persie already appear to have made great strides for Holland, despite the fact that the relationship that exists between them took time to evolve.

It actually started rather badly, Van Gaal emerging from his first encounter with the squad - a meeting designed to establish what had gone wrong for the Dutch at Euro 2012 under the guidance of Bert Van Marwikk – distinctly unimpressed with Van Persie. Van Gaal wanted the players to be candid but Van Persie stayed silent. Van Gaal asked him why.

‘Because it’s all in the past and a lot of rubbish was written about it,’ Van Persie is said to have replied in reference to suggestions he was part of a divisive clique that developed within the squad at that tournament.

As a consequence Van Gaal omitted Van Persie from his first game in charge, instead selecting Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for a friendly against Belgium.

That night news of Van Persie’s move to United would emerge. On the same evening Van Gaal would note how Huntelaar struggled to operate in tight spaces.

Having declared he was a coach who would give a player three or four games to establish themselves, he dropped Huntelaar for Van Persie for the opening World Cup qualifier against Turkey.

By then Van Gaal had observed how well Van Persie had started the new season at Old Trafford and within 17 minutes of the game against Turkey he had scored to cement his place with Holland too.

‘The real love began on a summer tour of Asia at the end of the season,’ recalled a leading Dutch sports writer this week.

With then captain Wesley Sneijder 
struggling for fitness, and Van Gaal noting how supportive Van Persie 
was of some of the younger players in the squad – in particular the 
Feyenoord players Daryl Janmaat, Stefan De Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi and 
Jordy Clasie – an important decision was made.

For a friendly against Indonesia on June 7 last year, Van Persie was appointed Holland captain.

By
 the following March Van Persie was being consulted on tactics. After a 
difficult game against France, a contest in which Van Persie enjoyed 
Holland’s one decent chance in a 2-0 defeat, Van Gaal and Van Persie sat
 in the bar in their Paris hotel and discussed the possibility of 
switching from their traditional 4-3-3 formation to a back three.

The
 idea was to employ a system that would create more space for Van Persie
 and Arjen Robben. Something that certainly worked against Spain.\

With Van Persie in Holland to rehabilitate from injury soon afterwards, Van Gaal took the opportunity to take him to matches to see Dutch club sides already using the system.

And Van Persie liked it so much he and Sneijder convinced Van Gaal to stick with a back three when the former Barcelona coach had suggested 4-3-3 would be better suited to playing Australia this week.

‘If they say that I’m going to listen to them,’ said Van Gaal on the eve of the match, although as it turned out he should have gone with his instincts. Shortly before the end of a difficult first half he abandoned 3-5-2 and went back to 4-3-3, winning the game as a result.

Prior to the Spain game Van Gaal asked Van Persie how he felt about families visiting the team hotel on the day of the match. Van Persie thought it a good idea, not least because the players were feeling anxious ahead of a meeting with the defending world champions.

So five hours before kick-off around 50 family members, among them Van Persie’s wife and children, arrived in the lobby of the Sofitel in Salvador.

A few hours later and Van Persie would celebrate a stunning goal against Spain by high-fiving his coach.

‘He is a good teacher; very direct,’ Van Persie has said of Van Gaal. ‘He has already studied the opponent before the training session so he has all the answers before we start. I like that about him.’

His door, say his players and coaching staff, is always open.

‘If you watch every player the relationship with the manager is very, very good,’ said Kuyt. ‘But everyone can see Robin has a great connection with him.

‘The manager has an open style. If you want something to change you can speak to him. You just have to have a very good argument!’
