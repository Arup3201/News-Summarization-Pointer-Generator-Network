Bayern Munich smashed Hamburger SV 8-0 as Pep Guardiola's side went six points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table in emphatic fashion at the Allianz Arena.

Thomas Mueller, Arjen Robben and Mario Goetze all scored two each for Bayern, with Robert Lewandowski claiming another and substitute Franck Ribery scoring on his return from a right thigh injury.

Muller got Bayern off the mark with a penalty in the 21st and Goetze pounced to make it 2-0 off a rebound two minutes later after Jaroslav Drobny saved Mueller's initial shot.

Robben maintained his rich vein of form with a wonderful curled strike in off the left post after eluding three Hamburg defenders in the 36th. It was his 13th league goal of the season.

The Dutch winger claimed his next two minutes into the second half, shooting a rare goal with his right foot when he beat Drobny at his near post.

'It was a great surprise for all of us,' Bastian Schweinsteiger joked.

Schweinsteiger set up Mueller to make it 5-0 with a curler inside the right post in the 55th, one minute before Mueller set up Robert Lewandowski's first goal of 2015.

Ribery scored on a rebound in the 69th and Goetze completed Hamburg's humiliation in the 88th.

'We lost a game, we shouldn't mourn. We need to get over it and show our true face (in the next game) against Hoffenheim,' Hamburg coach Josef Zinnbauer said.

Schweinsteiger was back in his favored role in defensive midfield after Xabi Alonso pulled out with a thigh injury.

'I play that position with the national team. I like playing there. It was wonderful,' Schweinsteiger said.

Bayern's Holger Badstuber started the game to make his comeback from a thigh injury sustained on Sept. 13. The Germany defender had been out for 20 months before that with a knee injury.
