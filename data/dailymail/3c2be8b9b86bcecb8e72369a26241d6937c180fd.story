Passengers who were aboard the doomed Asiana Airways Flight 214 have described the terrifying moment they realized the plane was too low as it prepared to land in San Francisco on Saturday.

One passenger, Benjamin Levy, recalled how seconds before landing he looked out from his window and could see the water of the San Francisco Bay about 10 feet below.

'I don't see any runway, I just see water,' Levy told NBC of his panic. 'I realized the [pilot] was a bit too low, too fast, and somehow he was not going to hit the runway on time.'

The plane smashed into the runway, severing its tail, exploding into a fireball and skidding to a halt at San Francisco International Airport around 11.40am PCT on Saturday.

Passenger Xu Das had the same realization, posting online after the crash: 'Looking through window, it looked on level of the (sea)wall along the runway.'

Fei Xiong was also on board the flight with her eight-year-old son who realised something was not right as they came in to land.

She said: 'My son told me "The plane will fall down, it's too close to the sea".

'I told him "No, baby, it's OK, we'll be fine." And then the plane just fell down.'

Levy said the plane hit the runway before it launched into the air, before landing again 'pretty hard'.

After the crash, he recalled hearing screams and saw his fellow passengers suffering from broken bones, cuts, burns and bruises, while the man in the seat next to him took a blow to the head.

'It was surreal,' said Levy, who was taken to hospital with minor injuries. 'A lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them. I wasn’t believing it either.'

He stood up and opened the door and saw that parts of one of the wings was gone, but he was just thankful to be on the ground. The scene was chaotic but passengers worked together to get out.

Passengers slid down inflatable emergency chutes as smoke billowed from the wreckage.

In the first comments by a crew member, cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye  said that when the captain ordered an evacuation, she knew what she had to do.

'At that point, my head became clear,' she said on Sunday night at a San Francisco news conference. 'I was only thinking about rescuing the next passenger.'

Lee said she was calm despite the flames. 'I didn't have a moment to feel that this fire was going to hurt me,' she said.

When a teenage boy was afraid to jumping
onto the inflatable slide, Lee said that a flight attendant carried him
on her back and they slid down together.

'The kid said he was scared. My colleague carried him on her back and jumped. I was inside the plane. (My colleague) was crying as parents tearfully hugged their kid after evacuating safely,' Lee said.

She also said passengers were calm during the evacuation.

Near the rear of the aircraft in seat 40C, Wen Zhang said she thought the landing gear had failed when she felt the tail slam against the ground. She, too, was with her young son, four.

'I had no time to be scared,' she said.

Zhang picked up her child, who had hit the seat in front of him and broke his left leg. Unhurt, she could see a hole that ripped open at the back of the jumbo jet where the bathroom had been and carried her son to safety.

'It left a hole very close to my seat,' she said. 'Enough for two persons to get out'.

Sitting near Zhang was 39-year-old Shi Da, who was traveling with his wife and teenage son.

He was shocked by the violent shaking of the crash, then the realization that the back of the plane had ripped off. He stood up and could see the tail, but the kitchen was missing with nothing but a hole, he said.

'I can see through the hole to see the runway and the ground,' he said. 'So we just grabbed our bags and rushed out from the tail, from the hole.'

Medics found the bodies of two 
Chinese schoolgirls on the runway. The airline identified the girls as 
students Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, both 16, who were on a class trip.

Miraculously, 305 other passenger on the plane survived the crash, with 123 walking away completely physically unscathed.

'We're lucky there hasn't been a greater loss of life,' San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said.

Witnesses who saw the plane crash said the plane did not look as though it was on the correct path.

'The
plane started coming in at an odd angle, there was a huge bang and you 
could see the cloud of huge black smoke,' Kate Belding said.

'It didn't manage to straighten out before hitting the runway,' Stephanie Turner, who was in a nearby hotel, added to ABC News. 'So the tail of the plane hit the runway, and it cartwheeled and spun and the tail broke off...I mean we were sure that we had just seen a lot of people die. It was awful.

'It looked like the plane had completely broken apart. There were flames and smoke just billowing.'

While it appears that the plane could have landed too early and clipped the sea wall dividing the airport from the bay, officials have not released an immediate indication of the cause of the accident.

National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived at the airport around midnight on Saturday to begin the inquiry.

Black boxes from the aircraft, which 
record critical data of the flight, have been recovered from the 
wreckage and will help investigators understand what brought the craft 
crashing down.

While 
authorities have said very little about the investigation at this early 
stage, clues have emerged in witness accounts of the planes approach and
video of the wreckage, leading one aviation expert to say the aircraft 
may have approached the runway too low.

Mike Barr, a former military pilot and accident investigator who teaches aviation safety at the University of Southern California, said it appeared that something on the plane in its low approach may have caught the runway lip - the seawall at the foot of the runway.

Investigators are also looking into what role the shutdown of a key navigational aid may have played in the crash. The glide slope - a ground-based aid that helps pilots stay on course while landing - had been shut down by the airport since June.

Asiana Airlines said it did not appear that the crash had been caused by mechanical failure although it declined to blame either the pilot or an error by the control tower.
