These are the amazing models of animals that are so intricate they can sell for up to £2,200 - despite being made of just paper.

Bernard Peyton, 62, has been making origami creatures for the last 53 years after being inspired by a visit to the zoo.

The talented artist uses just a square or rectangle of paper and folds it multiple times to create the three-dimensional shapes.

He has made a huge selection of animals including snakes, bears, fish, birds, insects and lizards out of single sheets of paper.

Pricey: This elephant and calf could fetch as much as £2,000 - despite being made of just paper

Impressive: Bernard Peyton makes no incisions at all and creates the artwork, like this ox head by carefully making creases and folds in the card

Intricate: To make this mystical fox, Mr Peyton glues hand made paper with long fibres together using methyl-cellulose, a kind of wallpaper paste

Expert: Bernard Peyton's two bats

He makes no incisions at all and creates the artwork by carefully making creases and folds in the card.

Each figure varies in size with some of the bigger pieces measuring more than 3ft, which often require wire supports inside.

The origami has sold for prices between £9.50 and £2,200 and some of the designs are due to be published in a book named Eco-Origami by Nicolas Terry.

Bernard, a wildlife biologist from California, US, said: 'I started origami at the age of nine when my step-father came home with an origami book.

'I started making animals after my mother took me to the Bronx Zoo in New York and from that moment I was baptised with awe for animals.

'My first original designs were made from something called paper-foil which is made by gluing tissue paper onto tin foil.

Technique: Mr Peyton made this leaf cutter ants using just a square or rectangle of paper and folds it multiple times to create the three-dimensional shapes.

Experience: Peyton has been making origami creatures, like these bed bugs, for the last 53-years after being inspired by a visit to the zoo.

Size: Each figure varies in size with 
some of the bigger pieces measuring more than 3ft, which often require 
wire supports inside. Here we have a swimming polar bear.

'Now I glue hand made paper with long fibres together using methyl-cellulose, a kind of wallpaper paste.

'The long fibres prevent tearing, and allow me to fold the paper slightly damp.

'The later technique makes it easier to fold creases that are not so sharp, and use the paper more like clay to sculpt forms.

'Once I am happy with a design, I twist and crunch as much natural behavior out of it as possible, adding or taking out details.

he makes his amazing Origami

'I have sold work from £9.50 to £2,200, the latter taking a month to design and more than a week to make.

'I start by providing a client concept drawings of the finished piece and choices of colour, and scale.

'I also put armatures inside bigger pieces made of wire, wood, cloth, or plastic resin, the latter can take a third of the time to finish the piece.'

Clever: Two bear cubs fighting. Both bears are made from one single sheet of paper

Exquisite: Bernard Peyton's
two quarrelling birds of prey

Masterpiece: This lying bear is on sale for more than $500
