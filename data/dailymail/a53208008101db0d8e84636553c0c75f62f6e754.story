A West Virginia teenager was sentenced to life in prison on Friday after murdering her one-time best friend and leaving her body in woodland.

Sheila Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder under a plea agreement that means she will be eligible for parole after 15 years.

Eddy and her friend Rachel Shoaf were accused of luring 16-year-old Skylar Neese out of her house in July 2012, before stabbing her to death and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania wood.

The 18-year-old from Morgantown was sentenced to life with mercy for the murder. Under the plea agreement a kidnapping charge and two counts of conspiracy were dropped.

Shoaf, who pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder, is awaiting sentencing.

Before she was sentenced, Skylar's father, Dave Neese, addressed the court, saying he was 'speaking on behalf of my daughter because she can’t be here'.

'We are no longer a family. You can see the faces of the killer, but you can’t see Skylar’s face. You can’t imagine how Mary and I now feel,' Mr Neese said, according to WV Metro News.

'The person sitting before you, Skylar's so called friend, took her away from us without any remorse or feelings,'

Prosecutors said the pair plotted to kill their friend, Skylar, but a motive for the brutal murder has never been revealed.

The nearest explanation came from Shoaf, who allegedly told police the girls no longer wanted to be friends with Skylar.

Eddy refused to address the court other than to say guilty. Neese's father later said he found her silence 'unacceptable'.

Her lawyer said it wasn't a signal of any lack of remorse.

Michael Benninger said both Eddy and her family are 'eternally sorry'. according to the observer-reporter.

As Eddy entered the courtroom on Friday, wearing an orange prison suit and with her hair pulled into a pony tail, she looked visibly upset.

Her voice broke when she answered 'Guilty' as Judge Russell Clawges asked how she pleaded.

Prosecutors claimed Eddy and Shoaf lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and drove her to a secluded spot near the unincorporated West Virginia community of Macdale.

They said the girls then stabbed her to death at an agreed-upon moment.

Authorities said the girls covered the body of the University High honors student with branches when they couldn't bury her, and left it in a wooded area across the Pennsylvania border for months.

The break in the case came in January last year, prosecutors said, when Shoaf finally cracked and told investigators what had happened and where to find the body.

Prosecutors said they planned to recommend a 20-year prison sentence for Shoaf and will oppose any move to have her sentenced as a juvenile. But she could get as many as 40 years under the law.

Speaking at Eddy's sentencing, Skylar's family revealed how their daughter's friend had comforted them and joined in their grief to try and cover her tracks.

Skylar's aunt Carol Michaud said: 'She came and acted as if she knew nothing. She pretended and stayed with us and comforted us and swore she had no idea what was going.To come to this day and admit she did just shows how evil she can be.'

Though Eddy's name was no secret in the community, authorities didn't make it public until September, when they transferred her case from juvenile to adult court.

Skylar was initially considered a runaway and no Amber Alert was issued to publicly notify people of her disappearance.

Last year, the Legislature tweaked the state's Amber Alert process that had limited it to cases where a child is believed to be abducted.

The revised law requires law enforcement to relay initial reports of any missing child to state police, regardless if the person is a runaway. Amber Alert personnel would then decide whether or not to issue an alert.
