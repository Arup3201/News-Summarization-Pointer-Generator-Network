Do you sometimes have a burning question, need some advice or just want someone to listen to you rant?

Two entrepreneurs think they have the answer to your woes - and it comes in the form of a modern day agony aunt app.

Agonyapp prides itself as a contemporary personal lifestyle companion; a social yet discreet way to ask questions, offer advice and get real answers from real people in real time.

Agony aunt: A new app, Agonyapp, prides itself as being a modern day personal lifestyle companion that aims to answer all your woes

Whether you need relationship advice, fashion tips, support through a tough time, some celebrity gossip or just a therapeutic rant, Agonyapp promises that it is all just a few taps away.

The free app, which launches on Thursday, works in a similar way to Twitter and allows you to start and join conversations, share agonies, comments and photos in a way they say is 'socially yet discreetly'.

It allows you to follow people and topics and you can join as yourself or anonymously.

Conversation topics suggested include beauty, entertainment, fashion, motherhood, news and gossip, relationships, wellbeing and work.

Ask away: The app, which launches on Thursday, works in a similar way to Twitter and has live question feeds and different topic forums

Be who you want to be: It allows you to follow people and topics and you can join as yourself or anonymously

Over time, users will be rewarded for their participation through 'auntie points', which will be used to reward participation and allow the community to gain a feel for the most active and 'appreciated' contributors.

The company also intend to periodically feature relevant celebrity guest 'aunts' to engage with the community and answer live questions.

The new app is the brainchild of 29-year-old Oyin Solebo, a former Investment Associate at Goldman Sachs, and Charles Sekwalor, 30, who used to work at McKinsey & Company, Tesco and Accenture.
