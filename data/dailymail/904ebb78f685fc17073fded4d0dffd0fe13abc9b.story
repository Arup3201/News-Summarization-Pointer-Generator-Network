Kehren Sajid outside court following an earlier hearing. The nursery nurse has been sentenced to a 12 month community order after mistreating four toddlers

A nursery nurse who dragged a toddler across a mat like 'a rag doll', dangled others by their arm and threw a 17-month-old onto a mattress close to a radiator has avoided a prison sentence.

Kehren Sajid, of Handsworth in Birmingham, was today sentenced to a 12-month community order for five charges of common assault on four toddlers in the Winnie the Pooh playroom of the city's Small Talk Nursery last year.

Judge Elizabeth Fisher told the 31-year-old: 'By virtue of their age, the children were vulnerable victims.'

She added: 'It is not surprising to learn that one 
of the mothers of the children concerned is angry at the way in which 
her child had been treated by you.

'Nevertheless
 it is clear you are remorseful for what occurred, for the way in which 
you treated these young victims, your lack of nurture and care.

'It is clear you need assistance as far as victim awareness is concerned.'

The crimes came to light after manager Rachel Barr saw CCTV footage of the assaults.

It
 showed Sajid throwing a 17-month-old girl onto a mattress, almost 
striking her head on a radiator, dragging a 14-month-old across a mat, 
and roughly hoisting two other toddlers into the air by one arm.

At an earlier hearing Miss Barr said
 Sajid treated the 14-month-old like a 'rag doll' and that she showed 
'no care or love or feeling towards the child'.

Sajid, a mother-of-three, said she had not intended to hurt any of the youngsters.

Sophie Murray, defending, said: 'She is sorry for the distress caused to the parents of these children.'

She
 added the treatment was 'rough handling' and it was unlikely Sajid, who
 is NVQ-qualified, would ever be employed looking after children again.

Caught on camera: Sajid was caught when the manager of Small Talk Nursery in Birmingham saw the assaults after reviewing CCTV footage.
