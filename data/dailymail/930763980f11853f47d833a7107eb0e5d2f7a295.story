A vigilante has taken it on himself to enforce parking rules on the streets of his crowded Queens, New York, neighborhood - by tagging the offending cars with spray paint.

The anonymous vandal marked up at least two cars in Glendale with rude messages this weekend.

One message, scrawled across the door panels of a perceived offender, read 'Park right s-bag.'

The other tag blared: 'Learn to park s***bag!'

Neighbors say parking in the area is a nightmare - but it doesn't excuse what the vandal did

WCBS-TV reports that the vigilante likely thought the cars were taking up too much space on the street and had not left enough room for others to park.

Residents of Glendale say on-street parking is a nightmare - but that doesn't give the vandal to right to tag other people's cars with paint.

'Nobody has a right to touch your property,' neighbor Dorren Pratt told WCBS.

She said she saw one of the cars that had been hit by the vigilante and she didn't think the driver had done anything wrong with their parking job.

'There was no way another car would have fit there. A smart car was even too big for it,' Ms Pratt told the station.

The driver of one of the tagged cars told WCBS that she knows hard difficult it is to find a spot in the neighborhood and she didn't think she would being inconsiderate.

Surveillance cameras on a nearby school captured an video of the man who appears to be carrying a can of spray paint.
