Row: Marketing guru Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, is at loggerheads with some of his shareholders over his potential £29 million pay package

One of Britain's top businessman has defended his potential £29million pay packet by saying it is 'right' he is paid that much as the backlash against boardroom greed engulfed him today.

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP, is facing a showdown with his own shareholders and said their anger is 'deeply disturbing'.

Senior executives at several of Britain's most successful companies and banks have faced an outpouring of anger from ordinary investors over their multi-million pound pay and bonuses, now being called the 'Shareholder Spring'.

And this uprising against fat cat pay deals appears to be heading for Sir Martin.

Consultants ISS, who own 20 per cent of the company's shares, say its investors should vote against his pay deal and some other large shareholders plan to do the same on June 13.

But in a robust defence of his salary and benefits, just a week before WPP's annual meeting, Sir Martin has warned that Britain must ensure people in its private sector are as well paid as those in America and Europe.

WPP has increased its pre-tax profits by almost a fifth to £1 billion in the last year, and so senior executives like him should be rewarded, he said.

'The compensation debate in the UK now seems to have shifted, from undeserving bankers paid for failure and from payment for performance, to what is fair pay,' he wrote in the Financial Times today.

'I find the controversy over my compensation deeply disturbing. Some imagine that I wake up every morning and make decisions including those over compensation in the shaving mirror.

'The board's compensation decisions are right because they reward performance, not failure.

'I thought the object of the exercise was to behave like an entrepreneur not a bureaucrat.'

He continued that he had built up the company himself and staked his own money to make it a success, adding WPP had 'materially outperformed the FTSE 100' last year and made shareholders a lot of money.

Sorrell, who was paid £13million last
 year, has seen his base salary increase by 30 per cent to £1.3million, 
his target bonus has increased from 167 per cent to 250 per cent and his
 maximum bonus has increased from 300 per cent to 500 per cent.

In total, shareholder advisory 
service Manifest said Sorrell could get £29million over 5 years, if he invests 
£4.55million in the company’s share-based bonus scheme.

His battle could become a test case for how much UK executives should be paid, experts are claiming.

Last month bosses at insurance giant Aviva were left humiliated after their multi-million pound bonuses were rejected by investors at their annual meeting.

Barclays has also received a bloody nose, with 31.4 per cent of shareholders failing to back its pay and perks. This included a package of up to £26.6million for its chief executive Bob Diamond.

While mining giant Xstrata received a protest vote of 39 per cent over its remuneration report, which sanctioned a package worth £6million for its boss Mick Davis.

And Sly Bailey, chief executive of Trinity Mirror newspaper group, was forced out after weeks of criticism from investors and shareholders about her £1.7million pay package.

And now WPP's shareholders are threatening not to vote Sir Martin's package through.

WPP's major 
investors are predicting a revolt with at
 least three of the group’s top ten shareholders preparing to vote 
against the pay and perks due to Sorrell.

Chairman Philip Lader and Jeffrey Rosen, who heads its remuneration committee, have written to shareholders claiming that WPP has ‘not been insensitive to current economic conditions’, but that the pay rise ‘reflects the board’s commitment to pay for performance’.

Shareholders will vote on June 13 on Sorrell’s pay arrangements at the annual meeting in Dublin, where WPP moved to in 2008 to be outside the tax jurisdiction  of Britain.

In response to Sir Martin's views, shareholder ISS said today: 'Our investor clients are quite clear that companies cannot cherry-pick benchmarks to justify inappropriate pay.'

Sources close to the company suggest WPP might even consider quitting the London stock market if investors vote against the proposals in sufficient numbers ahead of the vote on executive remuneration being made binding as the Government plans in 2014.

Such a move would be hugely embarrassing for the Government after it claimed last year that its business-friendly policies would persuade WPP to return to London, something Sorrell confirmed earlier this year.
