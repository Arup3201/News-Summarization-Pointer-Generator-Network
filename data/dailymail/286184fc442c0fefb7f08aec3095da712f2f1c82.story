Going on a helicopter ride, visiting the other side of the world, learning to speak a new language...

These are the kind of dreams that top 'bucket lists', catalogues of experiences we want to achieve before we 'kick the bucket'.

But it isn't just humans that have dreams to realise and goals to achieve: man's best friend does too.

Besotted pet owners from across the country have, along with a group of dog behaviour experts, created a 'bucket list' detailing the 50 must-do experiences for every cool canine.

Flopping in front of a roaring fire came top of the bucket list for dogs

Doing the 'Beethoven shake' and riding in a car should be experienced by every dog at least once in their lifetime

The achievements range from the lavish 
(having a personalised kennel, staying in a boutique dog hotel), and the
 loving (appearing in the family portrait, having a Christmas stocking),
 to the more unusual (becoming an internet star and being a ring bearer at a
 wedding, a task performed by Peaches Geldof's golden retreiver Parpy at her recent nuptials to Tom Cohen) and the downright ordinary (swimming in the sea, riding in a 
car).

With such an extensive list to complete, most of Britain's pooches have pawed their way through just a small number of the must-do items. In fact, a howling one in 12 adult dogs have not experienced any of the 50 activities, while just seven per cent have completed the bucket list in its entirety.

Why should humans have all the fun, eh?

So insurance company MORE TH>N, who commissioned the list, has created an app to help dogs and their owners find the best places to start ticking off their must-dos around the UK.

The most basic of canine and companion 
pleasures have seen a woefully low completion rate across the country.

Some 20 per cent of dogs never having had the pleasure of bounding 
through a forest.

And over a quarter (26 per cent) never knowing what 
it's like to attend a family picnic.

Looking across the nation, it would seem that itâ€™s in-land areas that are home to the most quest-driven pups and owners, as more West Midlands dogs have completed the bucket list than any others (11 per cent).

Chomping at their heels are dogs in the flat lands of East Anglia (10 per cent), while the four-legged friends that call the capital home take a respectable third place in the enrichment stakes (nine per cent).

Talking about the campaign and the research findings, TV vet Marc Abraham said, 'Make no mistake about it, we're a nation of dog-lovers, but it seems a lot of owners have become stuck in a rut.

'Taking our dogs on morning and evening walks during the week and out to a park at the weekend has become the norm.

'Understanding and appreciating the many different things you can now do with your dog will greatly enrich the lives of both you and your four-legged friends'
