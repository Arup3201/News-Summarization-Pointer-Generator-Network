An airline is facing tough questions after it sent a dismissive email to a journalist who had asked how it came to lose a woman's dog.

In an email sent from one of Air Canada's spokesmen, the airline said there was no need to respond to press queries as it was 'just a local story'.

The email, sent accidentally to the reporter who had asked for information, went on to criticize the media for asking about the missing dog during the government shutdown.

Dismissive: Air Canada accidentally sent an email to a journalist, which advised staff to ignore questions

CBS13 reporter Maria Medina had contacted the airline to ask how it came to lose an Italian greyhound called Larry, who was being rehomed in Canada.

Instead of getting answers to why airline staff had opened the dog's crate, causing the tiny dog to escape, Ms Medina was sent an email from Air Canada's Peter Fitzpatrick criticizing the network for running the story. 

'I think I would just ignore, it is 
local news doing a story on a lost dog,' Mr Fitzpatrick wrote, according to CBS13. 'Their entire government is shut down and about to default and 
this is how the U.S. media spends its time.'

When the news channel showed the response to the dog's owner, Jutta Kulic, she wasn't surprised.

'[I] wouldn’t expect anything different from a company that would allow something like this to happen,' she told CBC.

Ms Kulic had arranged for Larry to be flown on the airline to a new home in Canada, after promising his original owner, who was dying, she would find a good home for him.

When Larry was dropped off at San Francisco airport, she had zip-tied his crate closed and left instructions that he should not be allowed out unless in a contained space.

But, when his flight was delayed earlier this week, an airline employee decided to let the two-year-old dog out.

'They called ... and told me one of their employees had decided to walk the dog,' Ms Kulic said.

But Larry had been spooked and run away, with Air Canada workers unable to find him.

On Friday Air Canada responded to the loss of the dog - and the email about it - in an official statement.

'Air Canada acknowledges inappropriate 
comments were made to a reporter’s follow-up questions regarding Larry. 
Air Canada has been providing the best available information to media on
this matter. However, these comments do not refer to the search for 
Larry by Air Canada employees that is ongoing or our interest in 
returning him safely,' it said.

The airline added that it was in contact with California animal shelters, and that staff were optimistic that Larry would be found after several reported sightings.
