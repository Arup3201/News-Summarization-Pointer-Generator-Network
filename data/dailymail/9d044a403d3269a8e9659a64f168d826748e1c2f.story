David Murdoch has paid an emotional tribute to his father Matt after he died suddenly at the age of 70 from a suspected heart attack

A fortnight ago he led the British men’s curling team to Olympic silver in Sochi as his father watched proudly from a few feet away in the audience.

But yesterday a shocked David Murdoch found himself paying an emotional tribute to his father Matt after he died suddenly at the age of 70 from a suspected heart attack.

Mr Murdoch Snr inspired the men’s team skip to take up curling as a boy – and both he and his wife Marion travelled to Russia to watch the 35-year-old achieve Olympic glory last month.

But days after watching the highlight of his son’s career, Mr Murdoch, of Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire, has passed away, plunging his family into grief.

In a statement issued last night, David Murdoch, 35, said: ‘Myself and my entire family are shocked and devastated following the sudden loss of my father Matt.

‘My dad was a three-time Scottish curling champion and former president of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club.

‘He was a brilliant dad to us all. My mum and dad inspired me, my brother and sister to take up curling and have done so much to help us all in our careers in addition to helping to inspire many others to take up the sport.

'I dedicated my recent Sochi Olympic success to my parents, without whom I wouldn’t be where I am today. 

‘My dad will be missed by us all and was so happy to see me and touch the medal he has helped my whole life to aim towards.’

The statement concluded: ‘Our dad was much loved – by all our family, by his friends and by the curling community.’ 

In Lockerbie, friends and fellow curlers described Mr Murdoch Snr as ‘one of the great men of the game’ and expressed shock that he had died so unexpectedly and so shortly after the homecoming celebrations.

Alastair Stevenson, chairman of the town’s ice rink, said: ‘Our thoughts are obviously with the family.

'We’ve known Matt a long time and the family have been involved in the ice rink for a long time and everyone is just very sorry it has happened at this time.

Matt was extremely happy as to what had happened, whether that is any comfort or not. But he was very pleased about his son’s success.

‘He was a director of the ice rink and past chairman and Marion is a coach at the ice rink. She is one of the reasons for the success of these kids over the years.’ 

Mr Stevenson added: ‘Mr Murdoch was a keen curler, played cricket regularly and golf from time to time.’

Lockerbie is planning to mark the achievements of the curling teams but Mr Stevenson said at the moment they were just thinking about the family.

He said: ‘It’s just such a shock for someone who was as happy as Larry. I wouldn’t say he was basking in the glory, he was just enjoying it.

'He said it had been a great experience and fantastic to be there to see his son win an Olympic medal.’ 

Mr Murdoch Snr had been curling earlier this week at Lockerbie Ice Rink and was due to compete in a tournament near Paisley yesterday.

Team-mate and close friend Bobby Rae said: ‘I just can’t take it in. We played together for 42 years. It certainly came as a huge shock to me. I was with him two days last week at a tournament and we had a great time. We shared a room together and he seemed fine, as far as I could tell.’

Mr Rae added: ‘He will be a big miss to me and many, many others. I just can’t believe it’s happened.’ Before setting off for Sochi, David Murdoch acknowledged the pivotal role his parents had played in giving him his start in curling. 

He said: ‘I must have spent my entire childhood in the rink.

‘Most people don’t start learning to curl until they are 12 or older but I was already on the ice because my parents were heavily involved in the rink.

‘My dad has been chairman a few times and mum is one of the coaches there. It was almost a second family home.’ 

His siblings caught the curling bug early, too. 

His sister Nancy is the assistant national men’s coach while brother Neil is a former European champion.
