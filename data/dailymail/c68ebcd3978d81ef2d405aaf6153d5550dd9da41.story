Father-of-four Evans claimed admitted causing actual bodily harm to Mrs Mayers - but blamed it on a drunken prank.

He was ordered to pay Mrs Mayers £750 compensation and made the subject of a five-year restraining order.

Judge Peter Heywood told Evans: 'This was a prank which went horribly wrong.'

The court ordered Evans’ Grim Reaper outfit to be destroyed.

'The bedroom door opened and in the dim light I could see the Grim Reaper standing there.

'I thought my time had come.'

Mrs Mayers jumped out of bed but the masked man put his hands around her throat.

She said: 'I knew there was a man behind the mask so I reached out and quickly pulled at it to reveal Philip Evans.

'I wish I hadn’t taken my teeth out - he would really have felt my bite.'
