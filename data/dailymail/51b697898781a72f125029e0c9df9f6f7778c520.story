Two penises carved on a Roman wall, which were probably intended to protect citizens from evil spirits, have been discovered in Italy.

The 2,000-year-old stone could reveal the origin of Aosta, a city in the north of the country.

Archaeologists believe the phallic symbols could show a connection between the city and the Roman Emperor Augustus.

Two penises engraved on a 2,000 year old stone may shed light on the foundation of the city of Aosta in northern Italy, revealing its deep connection with the Roman emperor Augustus. They could also have been intended to ward off evil forces

Giulio Magli, professor of archaeoastronomy at Milan's Polytechnic University, told Discovery News the penis carvings show the ancient city was built during Augustus' rule during the winter solstice.

The carvings, plastered with mud, were unearthed during restoration work of one of the city's old towers.

Despite being incredibly old, the stone can still be found where it was placed by a Roman builder - on the southeast corner of a monument known in the city as Balivi Tower.

Archeologist Stella Bertarione, who found the carved stone, said: 'Originally, the stone stood in plain 
view. But in the early Middle Ages the tower was probably flooded and 
its basis covered by alluvial material.'

The block is carved on two of its faces. On one side a spade is carved over the penis.

In Roman times the winter solstice was represented by a Capricorn symbol (pictured) and was also the emblem of Emperor Augustus. The archeologists said the Emperor might have chosen the sign as it suggests the idea of renewal as well as the midwinter sun, which nicely symbolises a new golden era of prosperity

While the other side is more damaged, it is still possible to make out another phallus, this time with a plough and a figure that might be a Capricorn, above it.

According to the experts, the plough and spade both allude to the original trench ploughed to mark the perimeter of a new city, called the sulcus primigenius, which formed part of the Roman foundation ceremony.

However, it is thought the pair of penises relate to the god Priapus and were carved to muster some sort of protection for the dwellers of the city, against forces of evil.

The carving, plastered with mud, was unearthed during restoration work of one of the Aosta's old towers. The Roman city is surrounded by the Alps, which can be seen in this image of a street

While it might seem a shame that the carvings have been hidden from view for so long, the archaeologists believe they have been protected not only from damage, but from censorship.

Dr Bertarione said: 'In medieval times the evident phallic figures would have been erased since they were regarded as obscene pagan symbols.'

Interestingly, she said that the tips of the two phalli point to the south east, where the sun rises in the winter months.

The sunrise would be in clear view from the tower, which stands at the highest point of the city.

Dr Magli thinks this is deliberate and that Roman urban planners factored in the complicated natural horizon of the Alps, of which where Aosta's valley is nestled.

The tower faces the sunrise on the winter solstice and Dr Bertarione believes the city was founded on December 23 on the day that the sun rises in the direction that the phalli are pointing on the carved stone.

In Roman times the winter solstice was represented by a Capricorn symbol and was also the emblem of Emperor Augustus - despite the fact he was born a Libra.

The archeologists said the Emperor might have chosen to go with the Capricorn sign as it suggests the idea of renewal as well as the midwinter sun, which nicely symbolises a new golden era of prosperity.

They suggest the city could have been built to reflect this golden age and sit in with the cosmic sign ofÂ  Capricorn and the winter solstice.
