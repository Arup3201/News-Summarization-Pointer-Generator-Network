They say yoga is good for your soul, but now it can be good for your love life too.

Recognising that fitting both a healthy lifestyle and a dating life can be hard with today’s hectic schedules, a gym in London has decided to combine the two.

Singles Yoga allows you to take part in a yoga class while getting to meet and interact with other singles in the area, with the added bonus that you’ve already seen them in Lycra.

The classes contain a lot of couple and partner work, and are followed with a pub social

Richard Brook Singles Yoga aims to help people connect with themselves, and thus make connections with other singles at a deeper level

The class combines yoga, involving plenty of paired and couple work to allow people connect.

The class, held each week at The Albany Club near Baker Street in London, is run by Richard Brook, a trained acupuncturist who also works with other complementary and natural medicines and lifestyle practices such as Tai Chi. 

He began the singles yoga classes after noticing that yoga seemed to make people more sociable.

Richard says: ‘What better way to meet someone then when you are killer relaxed, full of feel good hormones and having engaged with a shared experience together?

‘When I first moved to London I used to follow each class with a social event and people felt more relaxed and able to chat.

‘What I’ve noticed a lot in my classes is that people find it a lot easier to become embodied and keep their energy and attention.

‘The first 10 minutes of a class is generally a sequence that allows you to become focused on your own body.

‘Where it gets interesting is when people have to meet and partner someone else.

‘I think this is similar to how we are in real life and how we are socially with people.

‘We don’t meet people in an embodied place and so you don’t have the same degree of presence about you.

Wendy, who goes to yoga once a week, says:

'Using a yoga class as a way to meet men seems a bit strange.

'Yoga for me is about letting go, being totally in the moment and not allowing myself to be distracted by anything else – it’s about having no ego.

'I want to be free for that hour of worries about my appearance and whether I look fat in my Lycra. The last place I want to be judged by a man is at my yoga class.

'Plus, it is incredibly hard work so by the end of a class I always look so wiped out I’m not sure I’d be in a fit state to go to the pub.'

‘In the singles yoga I work with getting people to partner up and, moving very slowly, into doing the exercises from a focused and embodied place.

‘Ill have them put their attention inside themselves, staying very relaxed and then come into contact with the other person.

‘I think it is very good training for life in general. It’s very common that we meet and engage with people and straight away we tighten up, but if we can stay embodied there can be a great energetic potency between two people.

‘I see a lot of people coming again and again because they have their eye on someone!’

To foster the connections made during the class- which generally lasts for about an hour and a half- the class ends with a pub social where you can chat to the other singles over a drink or three.

In response to yoga fans who fear that combining yoga with a quest for romance goes against the aim of conventional yoga to remove all vanity and focus on your inner self Richard says: ‘There are many different types of yoga and this is about helping people connect with others from a non-vain, embodied place.

'Yoga translates to unity and harmony - and this includes the world and people around us'

'Honest connection with people and finding harmony with others in itself is a life skill, and yoga is all about teaching life skills.’

The classes are open to all abilities, and cost £10 for both males and females, and Richard also runs 'Social Yoga' classes where people can make like-minded friends.
