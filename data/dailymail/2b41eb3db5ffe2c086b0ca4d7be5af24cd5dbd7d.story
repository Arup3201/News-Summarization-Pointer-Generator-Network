A herd of elephants slap a layer of thick mud and dust over their skin - in the same way as we apply sun block.

And with the baking hot African sun baring down on them, and a lack of rainfall, these elephants at the Etosha National Park in Namibia wasted no time in covering themselves up. 

The 'dust bath' is part of a daily routine that elephants practice after a morning bathe. The thick mud layer helps keep their body temperature down and acts as a parasite deterrent.

Photographer Peter Delaney found the elephants leaving a nearby waterhole and then captured them applying their all-natural sunblock.

Mr Delaney, from Avoca in County Wicklow, Ireland, followed the elephants after they had spent the morning bathing and drinking at a waterhole.

The 47-year-old wanted to 'create images that are unique and captures the essence of my subject'.

 And it was a 'frustrating week', waiting for the perfect opportunity to capture the iconic animals.

He said: 'But on my last day all the elements needed for these images came together.

'The image where the four metre tall, four ton heavy elephant raised his trunk filled with the red Kalahari dust and in one fluid movement sprayed his forehead is my favourite.'

The grassland dominates the national park where elephants roam along with ostriches, giraffes, antelope and lions.

Normally a slight red in colour, the pale yellow grass indicates just how parched the soil is outside of the seasonal rain.
