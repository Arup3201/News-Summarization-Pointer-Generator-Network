The Student Loans Company is a subsidiary of the Government and reports to Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills

The Student Loans Company yesterday admitted sending more than 300,000 graduates fake ‘Wonga-style’ legal letters over the past decade – as it suspended all use of the tactic.

The disclosure came as Business Secretary Vince Cable blasted the Government-owned company for using ‘scare tactics’ to harass graduates who are behind on repayments.

The Daily Mail detailed yesterday how the Student Loans Company had been using a trick deployed by controversial payday loan giant Wonga to harass people into paying up.

Last week, City watchdogs announced that Wonga would have to pay £2.6million in compensation to 45,000 people after it sent out letters from two debt recovery firms it invented for the purpose of frightening them into paying up.

It subsequently emerged that the SLC has been using a similar tactic for many years and invented the firm Smith Lawson & Company Recovery Services to chase payments.

Letters sent by Smith Lawson to graduates carried a banner in red stating ‘Do Not Ignore This Letter’ backed up with a demand for payment within seven days and a warning of legal action.

The letters gave the impression that Smith Lawson was a separate company and opened with the line: ‘We are instructed by our client, in connection with the sum outstanding shown above.’ 

Last night the SLC admitted that about 309,000 customers had been sent letters with Smith Lawson branding over the past nine years.

It also emerged that the Office for Fair Trading had ordered changes to the letters earlier this year, including increasing the size of small print pointing out that Smith Lawson was part of the SLC.

But the SLC said last night it had now ‘suspended all use of Smith Lawson branded correspondence’.

Mr Cable blamed the last Labour government for allowing the SLC to use the suspect tactics.

Last week City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed Wonga would have to pay £2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms (file picture)

‘The Student Loans Company has now stopped sending these misleading letters to borrowers, which were approved under the previous administration,’ he said.

‘We will also keep an eye on any others who may be tempted to use misleading communications of this kind.’ 

The City of London Police are looking at Wonga to see whether the company and its bosses have been guilty of any criminal acts, including fraud and demanding money with menaces.

Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘These revelations are very troubling and the police must fully investigate this matter as they are doing with Wonga. Parliament will also need to investigate.’
