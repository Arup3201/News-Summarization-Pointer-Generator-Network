Abigail Hernandez has been safely reunited with her family after disappearing nine months ago.

The 15-year-old vanished on October 9 from her home in New Hampshire. 

Zenya Hernandez, Abigail’s mother, said today 'we are the happiest people on earth', according to a release from the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office. 

A press release this week said that the 
facts and circumstances surrounding Abigail's disappearance are still 
under investigation.

Abigail Hernandez, a New Hampshire teenager, has been safely reunited with her family after disappearing ten months ago

The family had received a glimmer of hope after Abby wrote and posted them a letter in the weeks after her disappearance.

Authorities
 revealed few details about the letter at the time out of fear copycats could hamper
 the investigation and asked the family to do the same.

Investigators had given no updates as to whether the letter has produced any leads.

Mrs Hernandez told ABC in December that she believed her daughter was still alive.

She said: 'If Abby comes back, she won't be the ''missing girl''. We can get our lives back to normal.

'I
 would meet her anywhere she needs me to. She needs to know she is not 
in trouble with anyone. I just love her and want her home safe.'

Zenya Hernandez posted this heartbreaking letter begging her daughter to come for the holidays after she has been missing since October 9

In a heartbreaking open letter with a
 little sketch of a Christmas tree, the distraught mother wrote: 'I 
thank God every day that you are alive!

'I miss hearing your voice and your sense of humor. Please let me know what I can do to help you.

'Please come home for Christmas.'

Earlier
 on December 12, she wrote on the family's site: 'I will ALWAYS love 
you. I will ALWAYS have hope. i will NEVER stop looking. Love, MOM.'

Abigail Hernandez wrote her mother a letter postmarked October 23 that was received by the family on November 6.

Officials
 delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed
 in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager.

Law enforcement officials say that although the letter has given them fresh hope, they fear deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety.

One
 FBI investigator had suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to 
the young women in Cleveland, Ohio who escaped after being held for ten 
years by Ariel Castro.

The content of the letter or where it was postmarked has not been revealed as police fear copycats could send letters that would hamper the investigation.

Abigail was last seen on Wednesday, October 9, leaving Kennett High School in North Conway.

Police
 said she walked her normal route home and sent several texts to a 
friend between 2:30 and 3pm. At first, police said she made it home but 
later this was proved false.

Authorities
 also released a picture of necklace that the teenager often wore along 
with a purse she was carrying at the time of her disappearance, in the 
hope of jogging someone's memory.

Ms Young said: 'This is a child. She was 14 when she disappeared and had her 15th birthday a few days later.'

She
 added that the missing girl has no source of income, so someone is 
helping her 'whether that is a friend or what we fear is a foe'.

FBI investigator Kieran Ramsey said that they feared although Abby may have left willingly, she was now being coerced or manipulated.

Since
 her disappearance, Miss Hernandez's parents have made repeated public 
pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that 
they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is 
in serious trouble.

Incentive: The FBI offered a $20,000 reward for information in the missing person case

The last call
 made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was October 9 about 
four hours after she was last seen, investigators said.

The
 last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and
 was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm.

Investigators
 believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back
 from her nursing job, her daughter was gone.

The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on October 12. 

Police said they have not located the girl’s phone, but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm - about four hours after her last sighting.

It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain - a popular local ski resort.
