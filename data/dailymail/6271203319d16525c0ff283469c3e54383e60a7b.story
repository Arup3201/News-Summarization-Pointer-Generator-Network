Rupert Murdoch today sparked anger by mocking the 400lb woman who fell through the sidewalk in New York City.

Ulanda Williams, 31, was hospitalized on Friday with a broken arm after falling through the concrete as she attempted to shelter from the rain outside a restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

The media mogul took to his Twitter yesterday writing 'How did fat lady who fell thru street get to 400 lbs? Welfare, stamps, etc? Then leave us all with 20yrs immense health bills.'

Controversial: Rupert Murdoch has caused anger by mocking a 300-pound plus who fell through the sidewalk in New York City

Retract: After a barrage of abusive comments the media mogul appeared to retract his comment slightly

But the statement angered some of his 394,446 followers on the social networking site.

'Only poor ppl are fat? Escape your bubble,' wrote @axk.

@drgrist responded saying 'You probably should have kept that one between you and your therapist.'

'It's not the food stamps, it's the limited purchase power they afford and the food they're allowed to buy' wrote @murtaug.

The billionaire later wrote: 'Did not mean to be unsympathetic to 400 lb lady, but fact remains unhealthy eating by rich and poor driving up premiums for all.'

The six-foot-five woman fell about seven feet into a hollow basement, breaking her arm in two places and had to be rescued by the fire department with a crane.

Emergency Medical Services and the Fire Department were called to the scene and the woman was eventually pulled out of the hole

But after being released from hospital a bruised Williams told the New York Post: 'Thank God, they said that my size was the only thing that saved me.'

The social worker, from Springfield Gardens, had cuts on her face and neck and was wearing an arm brace as she left NewYork-Presbyterian hospital. 

Williams
said there were no warning signs indicating any possible danger before 
her fall: 'It happened so instantly that I didn’t even recognize 
anything.

'Cement was all over me, debris. They had
a bed frame down there, broken pipes and wood pieces. It was a hollow 
place,' she told the Post.

Williams fell seven foot into the basement of the Atomic Wings restaurant. Her subway card can be seen sitting beside the hole

Authorities were able to fish Williams out of the basement with a 'high angle rescue unit', which resembles a crane with cargo netting

'I was standing there approximately ten seconds and when that occurred, I just fell right through,' Williams said.

City Department of Buildings inspectors found that a four-by-six-foot section of sidewalk had collapsed into the basement.

Williams ended up in the deep cellar of the Atomic Wings restaurant on the corner of East 60th Street and 2nd Avenue

Emergency Medical Services and the Fire Department were called to the scene and the woman was eventually pulled out of the hole.

FDNY Fire Chief Thomas Jemmott said that the woman had to be pulled up in a 'high-angle 
rescue unit,' which resembles a crane with cargo netting.

'She is a very large person, 
but we were able to secure her and stabilize her and lift her out of the
hole,' Jemmott told the Post.

The incident happened outside the Atomic Wings restaurant at the Blue Room Grill on the corner of East 60th Street and 2nd Avenue
