Two radical Muslim preachers from the  suburbs who have previously expressed their support for the Islamic State have launched a national tour to help 'exorcise' demons or 'genies' affecting people in Australian capital cities.

West Australian Aboriginal Muslim convert, Mohammed Junaid Thorne and Sydney man, Abu Hamza, claim they can oust the evil 'jinn' or genies which are preying on the Australian public.

Abu Hamza, a self-proclaimed 'jinn buster' claims the evil genies can possess an unwitting victim and 'there's a lot of them in Sydney, in Melbourne, in Adelaide, in Brisbane and in Perth'.

Who ya gonna call? These two radical Islamic figures, Abu Hamza (above, left) and Mohammed Janaid Thorne (right) have announced their Australian 'Jinn-buster' tour. The men who hail from the Sydney and Perth suburbs plan lectures in which they will show people how to get rid of evil genies known as 'jinns' which occupy unclean or unholy people and wreck their marriages, health, happiness and cause depression

Abu Hamza says he has been a 'Jinn Buster' for ten years, helping people by driving out  genies and thereby solving marriage breakdowns,  children hating parents, depression, 'cure' gay or lesbianism, drug and alcohol problems and 'lack of appetite or too much appetite' - all by loud chanting in Arabic

Before embarking on the jinn buster tour, Junaid Thorne (pictured, left) was better known as one of two sons of a Muslim mother and Noongar people Aboriginal father who became radicalised, went to Saudi Arabia, and the returned to Australia where he has declared his support for the ISIS group

He says a person can be possessed by the evil jinn by not bathing or being holy enough.

And he claims by driving out the genies, he can solve people's marriage breakdowns, their children hating them, depression, and help 'patients who are involved with ... gay/lesbian', drug and alcohol problems and 'lack of appetite or too much appetite' - all by loud chanting in Arabic.

'I want to warn all my brothers and sister in Islam a very important message,' he says in a pre-tour promotional video.

Evil beings: Jinns or genies, as depicted (above) in this 16th century artwork 'Imam Ali Conquers Jinn' are supernatural beings from Islamic mythology made of 'smokeless and scorching fire'

'Any person that will ask you, when you go to see them, about your mother's name, or tells you to to give any part of your clothes or hair, you should know this guy is ... nothing but a magician.

'Be careful! Do not go to such people. They are nothing but evil and unfortunately there's a lot of them [in the Australian capital cities where Hamza and Thorne are about to embark on their lecture tour].

'A lot of people don't actually look after themselves hygienically .. and of course that's an opportunity for a jinn to enter the body 

'Be aware of them and totally stay away from them.'

Hamza then asks people to follow him on his Facebook page, to 'like my page insha'Allah' [which means  Allah or God willing].

His Facebook page includes a video of a 'jinn buster' at work chanting continuously in Arabic to exorcise the demon of a man sitting in a chair, in a process which is called 'ruqyah'.

Hamza, a Lebanese Australian who says his real name is Mohammed and who founded the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, claims to be an expert on 'black magic' and 'jinns'.

Jinns or genies are supernatural beings in Islamic mythology mentioned frequently in the Quran (Koran) and other Islamic texts, which describe them as creatures made of a 'smokeless and scorching fire' which can interfere physically with human beings.

Abu Hamza claims to have been exorcising them from people for ten years.

Junaid Thorne says on his Facebook page he had joined forces with Hamza to conduct 'a new series of lectures regarding the world of the Jinn, how to deal with them in the light of the Quran and the Sunnah, how to protect ourselves from possession, black magic, evil eye and the rest, and exciting but beneficial stories'.

He said 'the new tour around Australia that me and brother Abu Hamza - Jinn Buster plan to do very soon insha'Allah, starting locally from NSW, Sydney, and ending with WA, Perth'.

Thorne, a prominent WA cleric who has now relocated to Sydney, is one of two sons of a Malaysian Muslim mother and a Noongar people indigenous father, who became radicalised Muslims and went to live in Saudi Arabia.

Controversial: Junaid Thorne (pictured) was deported from the Middle East last year and has provoked media attention after he said 18-year-old Numan Haider, the Melbourne man shot dead while stabbing two police officers, had attended some his lectures

Beware! Abu Hamza (above, left) says ahead of his national lecture tour about evil jinns (above, right)  that  'any person that will ask you, when you go to see them, about your mother's name, or tells you to to give any part of your clothes or hair, you should know this guy is ... nothing but a magician. Be careful! Do not go to such people. They are nothing but evil and unfortunately there's a lot of them [in Australia]'

Junaid's brother, Shayden Thorne, was imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for 'terrorist offences' and has used his Twitter account to post Islamic State propaganda messages.

Junaid was deported from the Middle East last year and has provoked media attention after he said 18-year-old Numan Haider, the Melbourne man shot dead while stabbing  two police officers, had attended  his controversial lectures.

In a Facebook post on November 8, written in Arabic, Junaid Thorne said certain 'concepts ... must be corrected: the concept of security and stability ... adopted by the enemies of God as a pretext for the occupation of Muslim lands and the destruction and looting of its resources'. 

He also wrote about 'the enemies of God by crimes against Islam and Muslims' and signed it 'Sheikh Hatem'. 

Thorne promised the jinn-buster demon exorcism lecture tour, 'will be something interesting, beneficial, and exciting to all those who attend'.

No dates or venues for the tour have yet been posted by either man.
