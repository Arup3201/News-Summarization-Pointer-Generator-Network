The residents of an Australian have been enveloped in a thick, smokey haze for the last three weeks after a coalmine caught fire.

On February 9 an arsonist lit a bushfire that spread to the site in Morwell, Victoria, leaving Hazelwood open-cut mine ablaze. Coal mine fires like this one are particularly hard to put out because they are difficult for firefighters to access underground.

Even if the fire looks extinguished it keeps smouldering. A mine spokesperson told MiningAustralia.com.au: ‘You can drop a bucket of water over it and it looks like the fire is out, but it will come back as a smouldering fire.’

Morwell, a town 150km east of Melbourne, is touted by tourism agencies as ‘Victoria’s energy centre’.

The town's 13,000 residents are worried about the long-term health risks associated with exposure to smoke, even though health officials say there is no risk.

‘We are in the dark, we don't know what's going on,’ one resident told ABC.

Authorities say the ‘best case scenario’ would see the fire extinguished in 14 days but concede it could take months.

And police are still hunting for the arsonist who they say has ‘knowledge of fire behaviour’ amid fears the perpetrator could strike again.

Detective Sen-Constable Jason Benbow said police were focusing on arsonists who had struck before, The Herald Sun reported.

'We think someone with local knowledge is behind this, and definitely a knowledge of fire behaviour.

‘This fire has caused millions and millions dollars of damage, not to mention the health effects it has caused, plus the possibility of the power station going down.’

Victoria's chief health officer Rosemary Lester said an evacuation plan had been prepared but it was not yet necessary to carry out.

‘We've been keeping a very close eye on the carbon monoxide and that has not been a level of concern, which is good,’ she said.

About 25,000 face masks have been given to residents, Vice reported.

Residents are gathering evidence in order to launch a possible class action against the owners of the mine.

Local protest organiser Nerissa Albon said: ‘We're going to collect data to find out whose businesses are suffering and what are the health issues.

‘They're scared, they're starting to get annoyed now.... nobody can say when it's going to finish, it could go on for months. They would want compensation.’
