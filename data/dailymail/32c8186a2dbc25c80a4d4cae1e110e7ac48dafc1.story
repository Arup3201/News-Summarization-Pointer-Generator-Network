Lynsey de Paul left a poignant legacy beyond her lifetime of music, it was revealed yesterday.

The singer-songwriter insisted on becoming an organ donor – and three vital organs were immediately matched after her death last week to strangers who might otherwise have died.

Before an audience of stars from half a century of showbusiness, her brother John Rubin told her funeral: ‘I am extremely proud to say that even in death, she gave three people the chance of life.’

Miss de Paul, 64, was remembered yesterday by friends and fellow celebrities as her family gathered to say farewell to a musician whose songs became part of the culture of the 1970s and 1980s.

One of her biggest hits – Won’t Somebody Dance With Me – was played as her wicker coffin, adorned with a single red rose, was carried into a packed chapel at Hendon cemetery, close to her North London home.

Mr Rubin explained how it came about, reluctantly admitting he played a part. He told the standing-room-only congregation of nearly 200 that as a teenager looking to hit it off with the girls at a dance, he was told by his parents to take Lynsey with him.

‘On arriving I quietly parked my kid sister on a chair at the edge of the dance floor,’ he said. He made sure she had something to eat and drink, he added.

‘But she remained alone at the side of the hall all evening. This profound experience must have left an indelible mark,’ he said with a smile.

Miss de Paul died in hospital on October 1 after apparently suffering a brain haemorrhage.

‘Feisty’, ‘glamorous’, ‘vibrant and determined’ were among the words friends chose to pay tribute to a glamorous blonde who had relationships with stars including Sean Connery, Ringo Starr and Dudley Moore; ‘generous, selfless and talented’ to describe a teetotal, non-smoking, animal-loving vegetarian, who lived with a three-legged cat called tripod and fed squirrels and foxes in her garden.

Her niece Olivia filled the chapel with laughter when she described her aunt as a 4ft 9in firecracker ‘apart from the fact that Lynsey would have insisted she was 5ft-and-a-half’. Those present should not mourn the singer’s death, she said, but ‘celebrate her life’.

Among those attending were Pauline Collins and John Anderton, stars of ITV sitcom No Honestly, which used Miss de Paul’s song of the same name as its theme. She also wrote the theme to Hearts of Gold, the BBC series presented by another guest, Esther Rantzen.

Among other showbiz friends were former Shadows guitarist Bruce Welch, actors Tom Conti and Shirley Anne Field, and singer-songwriter Suzi Quatro, who wiped a tear from her eye as she walked from the chapel to the grave.

At her side was Mike Batt, the producer and songwriter responsible for immortalising the Wombles in song; and DJ Ed ‘Stewpot’ Stewart, who hosted children’s TV show Crackerjack and spoke on Won’t Somebody Dance With Me.

TV host and DJ Henry Kelly, smiling but sporting what appeared to be a battered face, walked a few paces behind Boris Johnson’s father Stanley.

The gathering represented the diversity of her life and the people whose lives she touched. Which, it transpires, was precisely what she wanted. She planned the humanist funeral some time ago and detailed it in papers left for her family.

Her agent Michael Joyce said: ‘She just wanted people to enjoy themselves. She wanted a big send-off, with everyone having a good time. She didn’t want people all in black and wailing.’

Miss de Paul, who came second in the 1977 Eurovision Song Contest, was the first woman to win an Ivor Novello award.

Gary Osborne, chairman of the awards, said yesterday: ‘Today there’s a Lynsey shaped space in all our lives. It’s small and perfectly formed, just like she was.’
