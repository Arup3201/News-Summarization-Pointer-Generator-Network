It would not be everyone’s idea of getting an inside view of nature. But TV presenter Paul Rosolie has allowed himself to be swallowed alive by a snake for a documentary.

The naturalist fed himself to a 30ft green anaconda in the Amazon jungle. However, the 26-year-old American took the precaution of donning a special snake-proof suit he devised to protect against the creature’s digestive juices. 

It is believed he was covered in pig’s blood to make himself appetising to anacondas, which usually eat wild pigs, deer, capybaras and caiman, and was pulled out by a cord attached to the suit.

Belly of the beast: In Eaten Alive, filmmaker Paul Rosolie intends to don the bulky suit and then willingly feed himself the Amazonian serpent, the largest of which can measure 30 feet long

The Discovery Channel, which will air Eaten Alive on December 7, was yesterday tight-lipped about the outcome of the stunt. 

But insiders said the snake did not die and Rosolie has since tweeted in response to animal lovers who have accused him of cruelty and demanded the show be axed.

‘I would never hurt a living thing,’ he said. ‘But you’ll have to watch to find out how it goes down!’

Rosolie's custom snake suit, seen here briefly in a Discovery Channel video, is designed to protect the naturalist as he's 

Rosolie, who has been dubbed the 'Indiana Jones of the Amazon,' specializes in the Amazon and his website biography says his experience also covers 'locations in India, Indonesia, Brazil and Peru.'

Experienced or not, some have called for Discovery to cancel Rosolie's show altogether.

A Change.org petition to that effect sprung up and is close to its goal of 500 signatures. 

'This is animal abuse to the highest degree and absolutely disgusting, and could kill the snake - an adult green anaconda cannot fit the width of an adult man's shoulders into it's body,' reads the petition.

New Jersey native Rosolie, who first ventured into the Amazon jungles of Peru at just 18, claims he's an advocate of conservation and not, it appears, just a shill for television ratings

Constrictors like anacondas and pythons crush their meals to death before swallowing them. While there are many unverified accounts of the snakes killing humans, it's unlikely a full-grown man could so easily be swallowed by one of the snakes

'Within the first five minutes of being in the forest, I realized that all the hype I had absorbed as a kid about rainforests was nothing compared to the reality. I knew that the jungle was where I belonged,' he wrote in his memoir.
