Colin and Karen McArthur are facing a £500 damages claim for discrimination after refusing to bake a cake supporting gay marriage

A court ruling over a Christian bakery which refused to make a pro-gay marriage cake could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it has been claimed.

Colin and Karen McArthur, owners of Ashers Baking Company, in Northern Ireland, are facing a discrimination claim after they refused to bake a cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie under the slogan 'support gay marriage.'

But now a leading lawyer has warned that if the case is successful it could set a dangerous legal precedent and undermine freedom of conscience.

Aidan O'Neill QC said the case could mean atheist web designers being forced to build a website saying God created the world in six days, or lesbian t-shirt makers being compelled to print shirts saying gay marriage is an 'abomination'.

Mr O'Neill posed the hypothetical scenarios in a legal opinion penned ahead of a hearing at Belfast County Court later this month.

The case began in May last year after LGBT activist Gareth Lee placed an order for a novelty cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie.

The design called for the puppets, who are often likened to a gay married couple, arm in arm under the slogan 'support gay marriage'.

While the bakery initially took the order and a deposit, Mr Lee was later told they would be unable to comply on religious grounds, and he was refunded his money.

Despite being able to find another baker who completed his request on time and at no extra cost, Mr Lee argues that he has been discriminated against.

He is now seeking £500 in damages in a case which has the backing of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.

Mr O'Neill has published his legal opinion ahead of the hearing, saying that Mr and Mrs McArthur are 'committed Christians', and that their beliefs should also be protected by discrimination laws.

He argues that, by being forced to make the cake the couple would be forced to promote a view they do not hold, which goes against their right to freedom of expression.

He added: 'This freedom not to be forced or required to express support for a particular opinion or political position was, indeed, the very one which Sir Thomas More strove to uphold in declining to sign the Act of Supremacy declaring Henry VIII to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England.' 

Colin Hart, director of the Christian Institute which commissioned Mr O'Neill, said: 'The strength and clarity of the advice from Mr O’Neill, who has a national reputation for his human rights expertise, should set off the alarm bells in this Government quango.

'It spells out the very real dangers and far-reaching implications for freedom of speech, but the equality watchdog seems determined to force people to use their creative skills to promote a political cause they fundamentally disagree with.

'This family run bakers serve gay customers all the time but they didn’t want to promote gay marriage.'
