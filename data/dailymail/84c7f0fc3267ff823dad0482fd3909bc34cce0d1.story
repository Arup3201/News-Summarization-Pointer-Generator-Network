A former New Jersey security guard has been sentenced to 50 years in prison for fatally stabbing his ex-wife 84 times and covering her face with a pig mask.

A jury found Anthony Novellino, 66, guilty in July of the murder of 62-year-old Judith Novellino, a high school English teacher. The couple had recently finalized their divorce.

Prosecutors said Anthony Novellino attacked his ex-wife in their Denville home on June 19, 2010 then covered her face with the mask.

Anthony Novellino was convicted of murder, hindering, evidence tampering and two weapons charges. He was captured several days after the killing in Washington state. He had faced a maximum penalty of 30 years.

'Now we can have some 
closure,' the victim's sister, Deborah Murphy, told the Daily Record after the verdict was announced. 'My sister can rest in peace.'

Prosecutors say Novellino attacked his 
62-year-old ex-wife, a schoolteacher and librarian, in June 2010 just 11
 days after their divorce. Before the split, they had been married for 
37 years.

Under the terms of the divorce, Novellino was to keep the home and pay Judith her share. He was also to give her $150,000 from his retirement fund, leading him to refer to her as a 'pig' to neighbors.

She was back at the house and packing items to take to her apartment when she was stabbed.

Novellino had claimed that his ex-wife had picked a fight with she was in the bathroom and lunged at him with a knife she happened to have in the room.

He insisted that he only acted in self-defense and told investigators after he was arrested that he could only remember stabbing her twice.

However, an autopsy showed that she had been stabbed 84 times on her neck, face, shoulder, abdomen, breasts and hands.

Afterwards, he grabbed a pig mask out of a closet and put it on her face before drinking orange juice and taking some aspirin. He then washed the knife and hid it in a crawlspace.

He then gathered clothes, took off his shoes and dumped them as he drove to Washington to meet a woman he'd been speaking to online for several years.

The couple's adult daughter, Christina German, now 35, found her body. Ms German was seen closing her eyes as her father was led into the courtroom for the verdict on Wednesday.

Anthony Novellino was captured several days after the killing in Washington state, where he had fled to meet a woman he had been communicating with online. She helped authorities track him down.

Defense lawyer Michael Priarone said the murder was magnified by the pig mask.

'It's difficult for anyone dealing with the case to look past the mask,' Priarone said. 'Mr. Novellino absolutely has a lot of remorse for what happened.'
