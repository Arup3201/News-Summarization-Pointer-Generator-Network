A high school community is in shock after three students have committed suicide in just seven weeks.

Jordan Halmich, a 16-year-old junior, was the first to take his life on September 28; five weeks later, Donna Cooley, a 15-year-old sophomore, was found hanging in her bedroom.

And on Monday night, former cheerleader Destiny Pearson, 16, became the latest student at St Clair High School in St Clair, Missouri to kill herself.

Police officers, parents and teachers in the small community are now rallying together to determine what sparked the suicides and to prevent any further tragedies from occurring.

Suicides: Jordan Halmich, a 16-year-old senior at St Clair High School, took his life on September 28, while Donna Cooley, a 15-year-old sophomore, hanged herself in her bedroom November 2

Tragic: Sixteen-year-old Destiny Pearson was the most recent victim, killing herself on Monday night

'Obviously there are a lot of emotional problems with these individuals,' St Clair police chief Bill Hammack  told MailOnline. 'But each case has specific identifiers.

'They are dealing with a lot of 
emotional and mental issues and there's not one reason connecting three 
different suicides of three different teenagers across three different 
jurisdictions.'

He added that accusations of bullying had surrounded all three deaths.

When Cooley's father found her 
hanging in her bedroom at 6.30am on November 2, she had scrawled words 
on her mirror, indicating that she had been the victim of bullying.

Her parents had also banned her from 
using her cell phone and computer as she was failing classes at school, Franklin 
County Sheriff Gary Toelke told MailOnline.

'She was upset about a number of things at home and school,' he said.

Police chief Hammack said that, after interviews with her friends and family,
 there was no evidence of bullying, and added that there had also been no evidence that Halmich had been bullied.

An investigation into the latest suicide is ongoing, with friends disputing over whether she had been picked on.

The school district held an emergency meeting 
on Tuesday night at the high school cafeteria to discuss potential problems, but so many people turned up it had to be moved to the school's gym.

'It's hard for me to comprehend that it 
even happened, that it's real,' a parent told KDSK. 'You wake up the next morning and you're 
hoping it's a dream and it's still not a dream.'

Dr. Michael Murphy, the superintendent of the St Clair School district, told KTVI: 'There are individuals here who truly 
are needing to deal with crisis and then there are other individuals 
here who are truly reaching out to support a community in need.'

He
 said out of respect to the victims he would not reveal further details 
about their deaths, and there was little apparently connecting the 
tragedies.

But he added: 'One common thread that I would see that is occurring is that there is social media involved.'

'We've tried to identify potential patterns that existed inside the school setting, outside the school setting,' he said, adding that investigations continue and help is being offered to parents.

'I'm hearing anxiety, concern, 
frustration, and rightfully so,' he told KSDK. 'Anxiety and frustration out of 
the fact of "could this have been prevented?"

'And fear from some parents that don't have the greatest relationship with their child and fear that
 their child may consider doing something like this.'

There are around 2,300 students in the 
school with 750 at the high school. The city of St Clair, which is 
around 55 miles southwest of St Louis, has 4,700 residents.

Missed: Jordan's girlfriend, Madison Whitworth, posted pictures on Facebook of the couple together

Jordan Halmich, a popular student who enjoyed basketball, fishing and hunting, died just a month before his 17th birthday, leaving behind his parents, two brothers and girlfriend, Madison Whitworth.

'Baby I miss you so much,' she wrote on a memorial Facebook group on the day of his funeral. 'Today was so hard saying good-bye.

'But we still are forever and always like you said today is our nine month anniversary and it is so hard but I love you more than anyone in this world. See you soon babe rest easy.'

Cooley, who was nicknamed DJ, ended her life after trouble at home and school, police said. Her father went to her room to collect his car keys when he found she had hanged herself.

'I'm gonna miss you dearly,' friend Brittanie Shea Kohlbusch wrote on Facebook. 'Your such a sweet beautiful girl and touched the lives of many. its sad that youre gone.

'Im sorry that you dealt with bullying in school, if only they would have known how terrible they made you feel and how much this would impact not only you,but also others who love you dearly.'

A Facebook memorial group has also been set up for the latest victim, Destiny Pearson, and friends took to the page to dispute claims that she was bullied.

Others wrote that Pearson had in fact stood up against bullies for other students.

'I have also known Destiny to stand up for others against bullies!!' Samantha Smith wrote. 'She took up for a lot of her peers. And she stood up for them many of times.

'She had a great heart and will be missed by many! Loved forever. A beautiful soul lost!'

Pearson, from Lonedell, was a former cheerleader and part of the school's drama club. She also loved riding horses, karate, sewing, reading and writing, according to her obituary.

A visitation for Pearson will be held on Thursday between 2pm and 8pm at Russell Colonial Funeral Home in St Clair.
