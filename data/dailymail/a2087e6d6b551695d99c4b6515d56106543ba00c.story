One man's 5,000 mile trek around Patagonia has been documented in a spectacular set of photographs.

Polish adventurer Jakub Polomski, who specialises in landscape and travel photography set out on a 30-day trip around South America and took in some beautiful sights.

Polomski actually started the trip back in February 2014, but due to his taking thousands of photographs, he has only just streamlined his fantastic collection.

Polomksi's love for the earth's beautiful, and often mysterious, landscape has seen him travel to Argentina and Chile, as well as Slovakia, France and Norwa,y among others.

He described his time viewing the Queens of Andes in Chile as 'the most beautiful national park,' and earlier this year he photographed one of the biggest glaciers in the world in Argentina, the Perito Moreno.

More of Polomski's breathtaking photography can be see on his Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/Polomski.Photographer and on his website. 

The Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina covers the equivalent of 35,000 football pitches

Torres del Paine is one of the largest and most visited parks in Chile, averaging around 150,000 visitors a year, of which 60 per cent are foreign tourists

El Chaltén is a small mountain village in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. It is located in the riverside of Río de las Vueltas

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, the 29-year-old, who lives in Cieszyn, Poland, said: 'The plan of this trip was very short. It was just departure and destination point, Santiago (Chile) and Ushuaia (Argentina). Everything else was changing.

'In our team there was an expert responsible for the list of stopovers. Sometimes negotiations concerning adding or removing point from the list were really tough. 

'In the first part of our trip we were travelling by bus. We were going from Santiago through Melipeuco to Pucon. In Bariloche we decided to rent a car. So we rented small city car, but sometimes it was hard to drive hundreds of kilometres on gravel roads of Ruta 40. 

Sitauted at Villarica in Chile is one of the country's most active volcanoes, however this was obviously the calm before the storm

Polomksi's love for the earth's beautiful and often mysterious landscape has led him to travel to Argentina and Chile

The founding of the Argentinean town of Esquel dates back to the arrival of Welsh immigrants in Chubut in 1865

'After visiting Esquel, El Chalten, El Calafate, Perito Moreno Glacier, Torres del Paine we reached Ushuaia.'

Polomski explained that he had visited Patagonia two years prior to this journey, but that 'five days were just not enough.'

He added: 'The fantastic thing about South America is that you can always do something 'mañana' (tomorrow).

San Martin, Argentina is much less wet and far sunnier than Chilean Patagonia, but still is very susceptible to heavy storms

Bariloche, emerged in the 1930s and 1940s as a major tourism centre with ski, trekking and mountaineering facilities

Ruta 40 is the longest route in Argentina and one of the largest in the world, along with the US Route 66 and the Stuart Highway in Australia

'We had delays, so the plan of the trip was being updated daily.

'One of the main reasons I love this part of world is that people there are very polite to travellers.'

The Polish photographer estimates that he snapped around 5,000 shots from his journey, and that only five per cent survived the final cut.

'I think it was better than I expected it to be,' he added. 

'The weather was great, and in this region it is more than a half of success. This year I want to go to Iceland, Alps, and USA.' 

Some 500 miles from Santiago, Chile, lies the town of Villarica, beautifully situated in the shadow of the volcano with the same name

Patagonia comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains as well as the deserts, steppes and grasslands east of this southern portion of the Andes
