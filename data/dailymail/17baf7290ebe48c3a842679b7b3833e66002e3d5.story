When President Obama flew to Chicago to cast his vote early in Chicago on Thursday, he became one of over eight million Americans to have already made their decision for the November election.

And now with the election just ten days away, early results from registered voters in those polls are giving both the president and Mitt Romney cause for encouragement - despite neither campaign having established a distinct advantage.

President Obama appears to be matching his 2008 presidential victory totals across the country, but Romney is exceeding Senator John McCain's efforts and appears to be already ahead in key state Florida.

'I think the early vote tells us the same story that we're seeing in the polls, which is that Obama's not going to win by the same margin he did in 2008,' said Michael McDonald, a professor at George Mason University who runs the United States Elections Project.

'We see it tightening.'

While the most hotly contested battleground is Ohio, unfortunately election officials do not break down early voters by party.

However, both Democrats and Republicans in the state are exceptionally happy with the voter turnout, which has dramatically increased from 2008.

In Cuyahoga County in Ohio, 139,884 people have voted so far, compared with 82,764 at this time in 2008.

'Notwithstanding the voter suppression, we're doing great,' said Stuart Garson, chairman of the Democratic Party in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, which the Obama and Romney camps see as key to claiming victory on Tuesday November 6th.

'If you look at 2008 as a watershed year,' he said, 'we are actually up. We have exceeded all of those numbers so far to date, which is really just remarkable.'

But with the turnout higher, Republicans believe that they will benefit from early voting this time around because of the higher profile campaign operated by Romney.

'President Obama outspent us in 2008,' said Alex M. Triantafilou, the Republican chairman of Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati. But now 'our effort has the resources to compete â€¦ this is a different race.'

'We think the early voting program is working in our favor,' he said, calling Mitt Romney a strong candidate and 'a terrific and an organized Tea Party'.

Indeed, other's believe that the 
early voting results point to a strong showing in the general election 
in November for a resurgent Romney.

'My
 belief is let the data do the talking,' said Adrian Gray who served as 
national voter contact director for the George W. Bush campaign in 2004.

Gray, who is not 
working on the Republican campaign this year said, 'I think in most 
states that I've looked at and analyzed, I'd say that Romney is in a 
pretty good position, probably looks a lot closer to 2004 than 2008.'

Analysts
 point to the fact that Romney has mobilised a larger portion of the 
early vote than McCain and analysts have noted that Republicans are 
making up a larger share of the early voters than in 2008.

Starting
 a two-day bus tour of Ohio's small towns and cities, Republican vice 
presidential nominee Paul Ryan told voters Saturday that President 
Barack Obama hasn't made the case he deserves a second term.

Ryan planned stops at a factory and a
 bakery, a couple of high schools and a dairy on his first day of this 
campaign swing through Ohio, a state that has become the lynchpin of 
Republican Mitt Romney's presidential bid.

Romney
 and Ryan appeared together on Friday night at a high school sports 
field, and Ryan planned to be in the state alone until Monday, trying to
 connect with working class voters the GOP needs if it is to deny Obama a
 second term on Nov. 6.

'We cannot afford four more years 
like these last four years,' Ryan told 1,000 supporters who huddled on 
the cold factory floor of Gradall Industries in eastern Ohio. 'And we 
don't have to.'

Ryan 
set out on his 400-mile tour of Ohio under gray skies and rain, 
beginning a swing where he would lay the blame for the nation's 
struggling economy solely at Obama's doorstep.

While
 Ohio has an unemployment rate lower than the national average, Ryan has
 argued that the state's relative fortunes are despite Obama, not 
because of him.

'He can't run on his record. The Obama economic agenda failed not because it was stopped; it failed because it was passed,' Ryan said.

Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin 
and the top Republican budget writer in the House, said voters need to 
consider how they want to feel when they wake up the day after the 
election.

'Think about 
Nov. 7. Think about how you will feel the next morning when you wake up 
and turn on the TV,' Ryan said. 'Are we going to have four more years 
like the last four years? Are we going to wait four years before we have
 real change?'

Time, for sure, is ticking for Romney and Ryan. Polls show the race close here and both campaigns' internal polls show Romney's uptick slowing or stalled.

The GOP ticket needs another boost if it is to overtake Obama, who has an advantage in the number of staffers in this state and his efforts to bank thousands of votes early.

To that end, Ryan is appealing in purely parochial terms, promising a revived economy if the GOP ticket prevails.

'Thank you for making the American manufacturing sector proud,' he said in a region that once was a hub but has struggled in recent years.

He blamed Obama for losses in the manufacturing sector, ignoring the larger economic slowdown that had reduced demand for goods and China's rising role in that area.

'We have lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs just in the last four years, 38,000 in just the last two months,' Ryan said.

He also sought to connect personally with the local voters, comparing this Appalachian region to his hometown of Janesville, Wis.

'Where I come from is so similar to here in New Philadelphia,' he said. 'We were kind of a one-factory town.'

Then, the General Motors plant there closed and residents who counted on good-paying jobs to always be available had to take lower-paying jobs.

He cited a friend who went from making $25 an hour with benefits to $9 an hour without.

'That's the story of the American economy right now,' Ryan said. 'That's the story that will end on Nov. 6 when we turn this thing around.'

Ryan even employed sports to win over voters.

'We come from Big Ten country,' he said to applause before turning to the University of Wisco
