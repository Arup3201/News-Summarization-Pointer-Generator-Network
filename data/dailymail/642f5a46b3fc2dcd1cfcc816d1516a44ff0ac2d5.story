She’s renowned for her red carpet appearances and high profile romances but Kim Kardashian says she is actually just a neat freak who only eats food from freezer bags.

There’s not much about Kim’s life that hasn’t been documented, from the sex tape which shot her to fame to her 72-day marriage to Kris Humphries but Kim insists the real her is a perfectionist who loves routine.

Writing in the Sunday Times Magazine, Kim, 31, revealed she has all her food delivered in special freezer bags which she keeps in the refrigerator and despite having a cleaner insists on doing all her housework herself.

As her article was published Kim made sure she looked every inch the groomed starlet out in Paris today in a green strapless military style dress adorned with gold buttons.

She wrote, ‘My food is delivered every day in little freezer packs, I put those in the refrigerator and make sure it’s all tidy.’

However, she admitted to pigging out on Mexican food and pizza at times.

While a previous episode of her reality TV show featured Kim freaking out when her family threw an impromptu party in her immaculate home, Kim admitted her cleaning habits go even deeper.

She said, ‘I can’t take a shower unless the bathroom is absolutely spotless, I think I’m totally OCD … everything has to be immaculate.

‘I have a cleaner who comes three times a week but I always do the cleaning on top of that.’

One person who is guaranteed to put Kim in a good mood is her boyfriend Kanye West and she says hearing his music on the radio is one of the highlights of her day. 

She recently accompanied the rapper to Europe for his Watch The Throne world tour with Jay-Z and splashed out $400,000 on sleek Lamborghini for his 35th birthday to show her love.

So in love: Kim says even hearing her new boyfriend Kanye West's music on the radio makes her happy

After showing her ill-fated wedding to Kris on her TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the star says she now hopes to keep her relationship with West more private. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Kim said one of the things that attracted her to him is the fact he is older than her.

'I always dated five years younger. My whole thing was completely different, and now I just love that I'm with someone that's a couple years older than me,’ she explained.

Kim tragically lost one of the other most important men in her life, her father Robert Kardashian, when she was only 22 but she has recently been dreaming about him and believes the lawyer is watching over his entire family from beyond the grave.

Spiritual Kim, says the dreams are her dad’s way of telling her he is still around.
