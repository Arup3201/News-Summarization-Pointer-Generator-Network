Middlesex have called time on their limited-overs name 'Panthers' with immediate effect.

The county, who previously played one-day cricket under the controversial 'Crusaders' moniker, have decided to abandon nicknames altogether and will be known simply as Middlesex CCC across all three formats of the game.

Chief executive, Vinny Codrington explained: 'When we launched our one-day Panthers brand back in 2009, there was a strong desire for each of the counties to have a vibrant and dynamic one-day name and image, resulting in names such as the 'Dragons', 'Sabres', 'Gladiators' and 'Lions' to name but a few, and we ourselves subsequently became the Middlesex 'Panthers'.

'A lot has changed in Middlesex cricket over the last five years and. We felt that one clear, consistent and immediately recognisable brand would offer greater clarity and assist us in terms of our awareness and recognition within and around the county and further afield as this work continues at pace.

'We are looking forward to being known now simply as 'Middlesex CCC', which to anyone in the game of cricket is a name that immediately evokes feelings of heritage, success and respect - values which we, as a club, pride ourselves on.'

Club mascot Pinky the Panther will survive the re-brand.
