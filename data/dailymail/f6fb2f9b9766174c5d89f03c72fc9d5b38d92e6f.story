Die-hard Volkswagen aficionados spent this weekend gathered at Harewood House in Yorkshire to show off their much-loved VWs great and small.

The annual VW festival In Praise of All Things VW is now in its 9th year, gaining in popularity as owners arrive to show off their models and spectators marvel at the vintage cars on display.

Around 15,000 people attended over the weekend, ending with the grand finale of the winners car parade on Sunday.

Some die-hard fans even turned up sporting VW tattoos or with dogs in specially made outfits.

There was a great range in the condition of the sought-after cars as some older models looked rusty and unroadworthy, despite their enduring popularity.

Volkswagen means 'people's car' in German and is currently the third largest carmaker in the world.

The company was founded in 1937 in Germany to provide an affordable new car for the masses.

One of the earliest models, the 
Volkswagen Beetle, in its original incarnation was first manufactured in
1938, and more than 21 million were sold before VW ended production of 
the cult design in 2003.

Another classic design is the camper van, which allowed thousands of festivals the comfortable option of staying overnight in their vehicles rather than the discomfort of a tent.

Elaborately restored, the camper van can make for a bedroom on wheels or even a very authentic-looking American diner, as one of the owners showed.
