A passenger jet bound for the UK was forced to make an 'emergency' landing in Portugal because of a mechanical malfunction.

More than 140 British passengers were thought to be on board the Edinburgh-bound airliner operated by the budget tour operator Jet2 when it was forced to turn back to Faro airport.

The pilot was said to have been alerted to a technical problem retracting the airliner's flaps shortly after take-off at about 12.30pm yesterday (Thursday).

The plane then had to burn off fuel by circling over the ocean before landing 75 minutes after departure.

It has also been reported that fire crews were waiting on the runway at Faro as the aircraft landed.

However, the landing went without incident and passengers disembarked the plane unaided.

A replacement aircraft was rescheduled to take the passengers on their journey and they landed safely in Edinburgh at about 1.20am today.

A spokeswoman from Jet2 denied the incident was an 'emergency' landing and instead described it as unscheduled.

The
spokeswoman said the pilot noticed an indication of a minor technical 
fault with the flaps shortly after take-off and, as a safety precaution,
decided to land the plane.

As the plane had a full tank, the pilot had to burn off some of the fuel before landing safely, which the spokeswoman said was 'standard procedure'.

No one was injured during the incident and the tour operator has insisted the crew were simply following a routine course of action.

In an official statement, Jet2 said: 'Shortly after take off the 12:30pm flight from Faro to Edinburgh on 6th September there was a minor technical fault indication.

'The captain followed the standard procedure, in that event, to return to Faro, where the aircraft landed normally.

'We provided a replacement aircraft which landed back in Edinburgh at 1:20am this morning. We would like to apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused.'
