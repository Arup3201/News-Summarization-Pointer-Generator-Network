Petrol prices across Australia are expected to rise in the next two weeks as the government introduces a new tariff on fuel companies.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann announced the new tax, which will increase from 38.143 cents a litre to 38.6 cents a litre from November 10, during a press conference on Tuesday.

It is expected to cost the average Australian household, which consumes about 50 litres of petrol each week, an extra 40 cents a week by the end of the next financial year.

However, if the opposition parties fail to approve the change when it is reviewed by parliament in 12 months time, Mr Cormann warned that the money would be returned to fuel companies rather than the paying motorists.

Senator Cormann explained that the government had bypassed the parliament and will use 'tariff proposals', to be tabled in parliament this week, to bring about the hike.

He downplayed the effect the tax would have on motorists, describing it as a 'very modest' rise, but said the $2.2 billion dollars that it would raise for the government over four years would go far in providing structural reform.

'While the impact on individual households will be modest, this measure will provide a predictable and growing source of revenue, which will help the government boost its investment in job creating and productivity enhancing road infrastructure,' Senator Cormann said.

'In the budget, we've announced a record investment on infrastructure - $50 billion dollars - and our commitment remains for 100 per cent of the money collected by the fuel excise indexation to go into road infrastructure investment,' Senator Cormann told Sky News.

The Finance Minister told reporters the parliament's support would be needed to validate the measure within 12 months.

'If the measure is not validated within 12 months - and we're confident it will be, by the way - the money would have to go back to those that have paid the excise and the duty,' Senator Cormann said.

'It will go back to fuel manufacturers and to fuel importers, who would essentially have a windfall gain at that time.' 

Opposition leader Bill Shorten, called the move a 'new sneaky tax on Australian motorists' and slammed the federal government for being 'so addicted to new taxes'

However, Mr Cormann said there would be 'no requirement' for fuel manufacturers and importers to pass the windfall on to road users. 

He said he expected Labor and the Greens to 'see sense' within a year and that the money should be used for roads and not go back to fuel companies.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten, called the move a 'new sneaky tax on Australian motorists' and slammed Prime Minister Tony Abbott for going back on election promises that his government would not see the introduction of any new taxes. 

Senator Cormann revealed the tax would raise $2.2 billion dollars for the government over four years

He said the move came less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament he wanted a 'mature discussion' about tax.

'Yet today he ambushes Australian motorists, ambushes the parliament of Australia and through the back door has launched a sneak attack on the wallets and cost of living of every Australian,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Canberra.

'This is outrageous. He doesn't have the courage to take his new taxes to an election. He is desperate to prop up his unfair budget.'
