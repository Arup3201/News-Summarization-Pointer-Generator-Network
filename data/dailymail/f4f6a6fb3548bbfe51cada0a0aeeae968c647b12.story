Everton's highly-rated midfielder George Green has joined basement strugglers Tranmere Rovers on loan until the end of the season.

The 19-year old is in his fourth season at Everton having arrived at Goodison Park from Bradford City in October 2011 for a reported fee of £2million. 

Everton beat off strong competition from Tottenham, Liverpool and Arsenal for Green who was compared to a young Paul Gascoigne.

Midfielder Green has made seven appearances for Everton's Under 21 side so far this season

After confirmation of the deal, Green tweeted: 'Really made up to have signed on loan for @tranmererovers until the end of the season, appreciate all of your kind message.'

Green, who has made seven appearances for Everton's Under 21 side this season, was a regular in the Toffees' Under 18 title-winning team last term.

He will now link up with Rovers who are 22nd in League Two and out of the relegation zone by goal difference only.
