A couple whose £200,000 yacht sank in an Atlantic storm have spoken for the first time about their dramatic rescue from the raging seas.

Lisa and Len Rorke described the terrifying moment they leapt for their lives as huge waves threatened to wash them away.

Back on dry land, they now face financial ruin after revealing that the vessel was not fully insured for their ill-fated ocean crossing.

Former primary school teacher Mrs Rorke, 49, said: ‘We really are up the creek without a paddle.’

She added: ‘We are so grateful to be alive, but we have lost everything. The yacht was our home and now it is gone.’

The trip was supposed to have been the start of a new life for the Rorkes, who were planning to sail around the world with their Jack Russell terrier Dexter.

The pair, married for seven years, said they had no fears about crossing the Atlantic when they set out on April 12 along with crew hand Arieh Worthalter.

But their dream trip almost came to a terrifying end when their 50ft yacht the Blue Pearl sank about 900 miles from Bermuda.

The three ship wrecked passengers Leonard and Lisa Rorke and Arieh Worthalter were eventually rescued when US coast guards picked up their distress call. The British-registered tanker Tilda Kosan, pictured, carrying a cargo of propane gas to Mexico, reached them two hours later.

The pair, from Oundle, Northampton, were nine days into a 3,000-mile journey between the Turks and Caicos islands and the south of France when conditions turned treacherous.

After the seven-year-old boat was battered for two days by 30ft waves, the trio and the dog were forced to leap into a life-raft.

‘I knew we were in trouble when I saw Dexter’s dog bed go floating by,’ said Mrs Rorke, who taught children for 27 years. ‘He looked at it as well and you could see he knew something was up,’

As the water flooded in, she grabbed food, water and survival gear, leaving jewellery and other mementoes behind.

‘That was our life, our home and here it was going down. Everything we owned was on the boat and we were losing it,’ she said.

With the boat almost submerged, Mrs Rorke – who is just 5ft 2in tall – mistimed her jump as she leapt into the wildly tossing life-raft.

She ended up partially in the water before she was hauled out by 29-year-old Belgian Mr Worthalter.

They then activated a radio beacon to pinpoint their position, as the craft was tossed around on the  raging sea. ‘It was like being in a washing machine’, said Mr Rorke.

Eventually US coast guards picked up their distress call and the British-registered tanker Tilda Kosan, carrying a cargo of propane gas to Mexico, reached them two hours later.

The 351ft ship was pitching so violently that its captain Nino Dionisio feared the group would be sucked underwater before they leapt on to  steps dangling down from the deck.

Mr Rorke said they were insistent that three-year-old Dexter was  also rescued.

‘If he had gone in the water I would have gone in after him,’ said the South African-born former detective.

The group were dropped off in Bermuda on Monday, where Mrs Rorke said an emotional farewell to the 13 Filipino crew, wearing the blue boiler suit that each had signed under the words, ‘It was an event we will never forget’.

She is now hoping to be reunited in the UK with her daughters Cara, 21, and Zoe, 19.

But the couple must now face the fact that they have no full cover. As they had only owned the boat for seven months, maritime insurers would only offer a third party premium – which does not cover a sinking.
