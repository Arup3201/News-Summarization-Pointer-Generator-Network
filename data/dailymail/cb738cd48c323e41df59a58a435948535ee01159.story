Britain is undergoing a 'brain drain' as skilled workers leave the country for a better life abroad, it has today been claimed.

But thanks to the continued immigration into the country from overseas, Britain is still getting bigger rather than smaller.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics reveal the number of British citizens who have moved abroad was 154,000 last year.

Figures reveal 1.3million University educated Britons are living overseas, which is more than any other developed economy

The figure has risen by a fifth under the Coalition, the Telegraph reports.

And statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reveal that 1.3million University educated Britons are living overseas, which is more than any other developed economy.

Germany has 865,000 highly-skilled citizens living abroad, whereas the U.S. has almost 400,000.

Nick de Bois, secretary of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs, told the paper that more needed to be done to 'sell' Britain to the talented professionals that live here in a bid to keep them.

He said: 'We have to convince those people, who we have invested so much in, to make Britain their first choice. We have to continue to drive lower taxes, we have to keep driving the change and reform in our public services.'

He said that many of those leaving Britain are emigrating to work in Hong Kong and countries in the Middle East, where they will have a better standard of living and education for their children.

They tend to go to  aerospace, engineering and creative companies, he said.

More than 100,000 additional citizens chose to live abroad last year - almost equivalent to the number of foreigners choosing to leave the country.

But the population is still growing. Since 1992 the UK population has risen by 6.1million, a rise of 11 per cent

Recent figures show the increase in the number of people living in the UK was higher than any other country in the European Union

Mr de Bois said that it means we are losing the professional, skilled class, but that lower taxes and a change of culture could help persuade them to stay.

It comes as concern mounts over the number of British graduates 
from the country's best universities who are choosing to work abroad.

One-in-10 graduates from Cambridge, 
Durham, Exeter and Oxford 2011 are now working overseas.

The figure is 12 per cent among British students from St Andrews.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that the population in Britain rose by almost 420,000 in a year, driven by the highest birth rate since 1972.

The figure, which covers the 12 months to the middle of 2012 is more than the population increases in Germany, Belgium, Holland and Sweden combined.

The Office for National Statistics says around four in ten of the additional people are immigrants. Six out of ten are the result of rising birth rates, which brought a 40-year high in the number of babies born last year – 254,400 more births than deaths.
