Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood believes Spurs are on the right track after a promising start to the Premier League season under Mauricio Pochettino.

Sherwood has been encouraged by their form, picking up seven points from their first four league games of the season.

Former Southampton manager Pochettino has also guided Tottenham into the Europa League group stages.

'They've done well. They ground a result out against West Ham, played very well against Queens Park Rangers,' Sherwood told Sky Sports.

'It was a little bit difficult for them against Liverpool but they should've won the game on Saturday against Sunderland.

'Seven points from their first four games represents a solid start to the season, though after leading twice at the Stadium of Light, coming away with just a point will have been viewed as a disappointment.

'But they are showing signs of buying into Mauricio Pochettino's style of play, and as the season goes on, the side could get stronger.'

Sherwood was asked whether Spurs can finish in the top four with Champions League qualification come the end of the season.

'It's similar to how it's always been. It's always going to be very difficult and we know that Man United might come to the party this year as well so it almost makes it even more difficult,' added Sherwood.

'It's a difficult task but they'll be in and around it as Tottenham have been in the last four or five years.'
