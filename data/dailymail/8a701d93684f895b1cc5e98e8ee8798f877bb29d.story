World Cup winner Ronaldo has hit out at Colombia defender Juan Zuniga for his dangerous tackle on Neymar which ended the Brazilian star’s World Cup with a broken back.

FIFA have said their disciplinary committee would review the incident and it is likely that Zuniga will receive a lengthy ban because referee Carlos Velasco Carballo did not see the foul and did not punish Zuniga.

Ronaldo, who won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil said: ‘The injury was a very violent one. There was an intention to cause some harm. I don’t think it was a normal football play. I do believe it was aggressive.

‘I didn’t like the very high knee and that leads me to believe it was a foul with the intention to cause harm. I thought it was a highly violent and unlawful move by the Colombia player. We are fearful and sad for the loss of our player.’

Moving: Neymar was flown to Sao Paulo by helicopter to begin his recovery

Broken: The x-ray showing Neymar's injured back, highlighting the broken bone

Precaution: Neymar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star
