Sam Brown, 19, and Tarsha Wild, 18, had been together for three years before his tragic death in a free diving accident on Saturday

Ms Wild said she was 'overwhelmed' by Mr Brown's death, and he was 'the love of (her) life'

Ms Wild said she was 'grateful for all the amazing memories' she shared with Mr Brown

The screenshot was accompanied by the caption from Ms Wild: 'I'm trying to be strong baby I promise but right now I wish you could just tell me that everything is going to be alright and that this is all some sort of bad dream; I miss you and love you babe.'

She earlier told Daily Mail Australia she was 'overwhelmed' by 'the love of her life and best friend's' death.

Ms Wild said the last time they spoke was at 1am on Saturday morning when Mr Brown left home.  

Mr Brown died while free diving north of Moreton Island with some friends. 

They were competing with each other to see who could dive the deepest, when he passed out while about 15m underwater, according to reports.

The heartbreaking message Mr Brown sent Ms Wild, which she posted online on Monday morning

Friends raced down more than 30 metres to recover their mate and attempted to resuscitate Mr Brown. He could not be revived.

The desperate rescue attempt was captured on GoPro cameras the friends were all wearing. 

Water Police Sergeant Shaun Harrison said his friends pushed through normal human limits to rescue their mate.

'They've managed through some actions of their own ... to grab him and bring him back to the surface,' Sgt Harrison said. 

Chad Collins, one of the friends with Mr Brown, said his 'best mate' was 'born to swim in the ocean'.

'18 months ago he wanted a new challenge so we went and bought a speargun off Gumtree and took up freediving,' Chad told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

Mr Brown's devastated mother Maree Hutton said her 'adventurous and perfect' boy died doing what made he happy

'He died very peacefully. He was very relaxed. There was no pain and he was very much at ease. It helps me knowing that he didn't feel pain.' 

Mr Brown's devastated mother Maree Hutton said her 'adventurous and perfect' boy died doing what made he happy.

'I just want people to know that my son died doing what he loved and he would want us to celebrate everything he loved.' 

Professional free diver and Apnea International Founder Erez Beautus, said the tragedy was a painful reminder for all divers to have a 'safety buddy' in the water.

'Just exactly for this case, for this scenario, so if something goes wrong, your buddy can be watching you all the time,' Mr Beautus said.

'If we dive a little bit deeper - deeper than 10 metres - the sole responsibility of the safety diver is to take care of his buddy at that moment in time.'

He also said the accident was 'tragic but preventable'.
