'Driven by revenge': Vicky Pryce ex-wife of Chris Huhne pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court yesterday

It was the day when the pure fury felt by Vicky Pryce over her husband’s infidelity was laid bare to the world.

A jury heard how she hatched a plot to ‘destroy’ Chris Huhne after discovering he had left her for another woman.

Pryce, 60, decided to ‘bring Chris down’ and ‘nail him’ as an act of vengeance after the Lib Dem Cabinet Minister walked out on her after 26 years of marriage for Carina Trimingham, the court was told.

Driven by a thirst for ‘revenge’, she decided to leak the sensational story that he forced her to take his speeding points to escape a driving ban.

In one email she wrote: ‘I really want to nail him. More than ever actually, and I would love to do it soon.’

Southwark Crown Court heard how Pryce hatched a plot with a journalist from the Sunday Times to ‘set up’ Huhne in a series of taped phone calls which were yesterday played to the jury.

But the wary politician had refused to admit the offence in a series of heated exchanges which only served to illustrate the bitterness of the couple’s split.

In one call, Huhne accuses his former wife of telling the papers that he has split up with the woman he left her for, his bisexual former press adviser Miss Trimingham.

Pryce responds: ‘I’m very pleased for you that you are still with that man of yours.’

In another call she complains her home is under siege from journalists saying: ‘I can’t even get home, whether it’s to do with your ****ing man or whether it’s to do with your ****ing points.’

In separate heated exchange Pryce calls Huhne a ‘moron’ for suggesting she might be colluding with the press.

The phone calls were played to the jury a day after Huhne, 58, sensationally pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and stood down as an MP, effectively terminating his political career.

Yesterday Pryce returned to the same courtroom accused of dishonestly accepting the speeding points in 2003.

She admits her involvement but denies the offence on the grounds of ‘marital coercion’, meaning Huhne bullied her into helping him.

But prosecutors branded her a ‘strong-minded and manipulative woman’ who deliberately passed the story to a Sunday newspaper.

Anger: Vicky Pryce called her husband a 'moron' after he accused her of colluding with the press

Opening
the case at Southwark Crown Court, Andrew Edis QC, said Pryce was fully
aware the damaging allegations would torpedo Huhne’s political career.

He
claimed that far from being a ‘bullied woman’ she took the ‘line of 
least resistance’ and ‘played ball’ with her then husband over the 
penalty in 2003.

But by 2010, within months of him leaving her for his PR aide Carina Trimingham, 46, Pryce decided to use her knowledge of what they had done as her revenge.

Mr Edis said there was ‘no doubt’ the mother-of-five was left ‘distressed’ by the ‘terrible’ and sudden end to her marriage.

He said: ‘But there is also no doubt at all that she was not only distressed but extremely angry and she wanted some revenge.

‘And her revenge was in the end to pass the story about the 2003 crime to the newspapers so that it would be published in the end, that it would destroy her husband’s career.’

Addressing the jury on her decision to take the points, he added: ‘Focus not on whether she was persuaded but whether she was in a situation where she had a choice.

Chris Huhne, with his partner Carina Trimingham, outside Southwark Crown Court in central London on Monday. Huhne pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice

Huhne, the former Energy Secretary, 
stepped down as Lib Dem MP for Eastleigh on Monday by accepting the post
of Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds.

His
guilty plea meant he did not go on trial with his wife over the ticket 
he received for speeding in his black BMW as he returned home from 
Stansted Airport on March 12, 2003.

He
admitted asking Pryce to accept the points so he could avoid an 
automatic six-month ban as he already had nine points on his licence.

In court yesterday, Mr Edis revealed details of emails and phone calls outlining how Pryce plotted her revenge after he left her eight years later.

On March 1, 2011, Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott told Pryce her claims could ‘inflict maximum, perhaps fatal damage’ if she spoke openly.

She said this would achieve the ‘dual purpose’ of ‘bringing Huhne down’ without seriously damaging Pryce’s own reputation in the process.

Pryce replied that she was unsure whether to publish the explosive story before or after her divorce was finalised.

She added: ‘So I need reassurance that it would indeed bring Huhne down. I have no doubt, as I really want to nail him. More than ever actually, and I would love to do it soon.’

The two women then secretly recorded four phone calls between Pryce and Huhne as they tried to get the politician to incriminate himself. Mr Edis told the court Huhne ‘did not fall for it’ and the calls simply showed two ‘manipulative’ people ‘trying unsuccessfully’ to manipulate each other.

The jury of eight women and four men was told Pryce is using a special legal defence available only to wives, claiming she was coerced into committing a crime.

Mr Edis told them that it ‘may surprise you but it is true, that is what the law says’.

He said they must decide whether Pryce was ‘weak- minded’ and forced into accepting the points or acted of her own free will.

The trial was adjourned until Thursday when Miss Oakeshott will be called as a prosecution witness.

The other woman: Carina Trimingham, the press adviser who became Huhne's lover

Vicky Pryce’s burning hatred for her husband’s new lover echoed across a courtroom yesterday.

In a series of phone calls played to a jury, she repeatedly brands Chris Huhne’s bisexual partner Carina Trimingham a ‘****ing man’.

The angry outburst took place after the Cabinet Minister accused his former wife of leaking a story to the Press that he had split up with the woman he had left her for.

Pryce, once a top Government economics adviser, responds bluntly: ‘I don’t give a s*** about that because you are nothing to do with me.’

Later, she added: ‘I’m very pleased for you that you are still with that man of yours.’

In another call, Pryce complains her £2million family home in a private street in Clapham, south London, is under siege from journalists.

She said: ‘They are pressurising all the ****ing time, I can’t even get through the front door, whether it’s to do with your ****ing man, or to do with your ****ing points.’

Pryce and Isabel Oakeshott, the political editor of the Sunday Times, planned to secretly record four phone conversations with Huhne in April 2011.

The pair were desperate to obtain hard evidence of the politician incriminating himself so the story of his dishonesty could be published.

Yesterday the jury was played the tapes which reveal Pryce fiercely barracking her former husband, insulting his new partner and brow-beating him over the points.

She repeatedly tried to provoke Huhne into confirming he committed the crime, but he was wary of what she was up to and resolutely denied it, telling her not to speak to the Press.

At times in the phone calls played to the court, the former Energy Secretary repeatedly fends off his wife as she rants over his denials, but on other occasions he is more conciliatory.

At one point he tells her: ‘Can I suggest, if you want to stop journalists door-stepping you, you stop telling ridiculous stories to the Press?’

Pryce also dishonestly denies having any involvement in the Fleet Street rumours in a bid to find some common ground between them.

She said: ‘Why would I tell anyone about me taking your points? It’s not in my interests. Are you a moron?’

Huhne cautiously tells her the newspapers cannot publish the story if she does not ‘stand it up’ and she must not speak to them.

Yesterday's Daily Mail

When Huhne accuses her of ‘maliciously briefing the Press’ to ruin his  political career Pryce points out their ‘entire family’ knew she had taken took his points.

She insisted: ‘You know full well that I took your points.’

But her former husband dodged the accusation and avoided confirming her claims. Huhne advised Pryce not to  take calls from Miss Oakeshott, and said: ‘They have no story and they  cannot have a story unless you give it to them.

‘There’s no reason for you to give them a story because it isn’t true.’

He told his former wife not to tell ‘false stories’ and compared the situation to ‘rubbing Aladdin’s lamp’ and letting the ‘genie of the bottle’.

In another conversation Pryce said she did not want to ‘perjure’ herself by denying she had taken the points for him. She added: ‘It’s one of the things that’s always worried me when you made me take them in the first instance.’

As their relationship deteriorated further, Huhne said the truth was that Pryce was ‘maliciously briefing the Press’ to ruin his political career.

At one point the exasperated MP told her: ‘You are behaving in an entirely unbalanced way.’
