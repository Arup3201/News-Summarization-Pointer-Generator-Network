Hello from New York!

As you may know, I'm currently Stateside to film a very special series of Made in Chelsea. So far it's been a whirlwind of gorgeous weather, shopping and cocktails, and I'm loving every minute. But don't worry, I haven't forgotten you all back in Blighty!

Earlier this year I found out the exciting news that the annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will be taking place in London this year, and I'm determined to get hold of a golden ticket.

I can't help but love the glitz and glamour of Victoria's Secret - not to mention the divine beauty looks on the models.

So this week - as I'm in the true home of Victoria's Secret - I thought I'd show you a wearable daytime twist on the signature glamorous look of the Angels, with a flawless, glowing complexion and shimmering smokey eye.

Step 1 - Gorgeously Glowing

First, I applied bareMinerals Prime Time face primer all over my face for a velvety smooth base to work from.

A flawless, glowing complexion is imperative if you want to look like a Victoria's Secret Angel, so to recreate this I used Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation, gently buffing it into my skin with a foundation brush.

The great thing about this foundation is it has a really buildable coverage, camouflaging pesky blemishes whilst still maintaining a dewy finish.

The nifty matching concealer in the lid can also be used to add extra coverage to any problem areas. I then set my glowy base in place with a sweep of Vichy Dermablend Setting Powder.

Step 2 - Bedroom Eyes

Now for the eyes - the Victoria's Secret Angels are renowned for their smouldering, sexy eye make-up, so for this look I've opted for a golden smokey eye.

I first applied a touch of bareMinerals Brightening Eye Primer over my lids, which provides a smooth base for eyeshadow as well as increasing its longevity.

The bareMinerals Ready Eyeshadow Palette in The Rare Find offers a gorgeous selection of shimmery golden shades - plus I can't fault the buttery texture of the shadows.

I first swept the champagne shade all over my lid, before taking the gold shade to define my crease and emphasise the outer corners of my eyes. Using a smaller brush, I went on to define my upper and lower lashes with the same shade.

To give my peepers that added va va voom, I dabbed a touch of bareMinerals High Shine Eye Colour in Bronzed to the outer and inner corners. The colour payoff with this pigment is phenomenal, so a little does go a long way!

I then coated my lashes with Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara to make them full and flirty - wiggling the brush up from the root to define each lash.

Step 3 - Sculpted and Sexy

It wouldn't be Victoria's Secret without bronzer - and you all know Binky loves bronzer! For this look I used Daniel Sandler's Spice Twice bronzer to contour and sculpt my face, sweeping the colour under my cheekbones, across my temples and under my jawline.

Then, to give my face that effortless Angel glow I dabbed a touch of Clarins Instant Light Radiance Boosting Base across the tops of my cheekbones, under my brow bones and down my nose. For an ethereal shimmer I followed this up with a sweep of Too Faced Candlelight Highlighter across the tops of my cheekbones.

Binky kept her lips quite neutral in order to achieve a daytime look

I wanted to keep my lips quite neutral, so slicked on a layer of pink lipgloss from bareMinerals. I also recommend the Clarins Instant Light Lip Perfectors to give your pout a similar pinky sheen.

If you wanted to turn this into more of a party look, simply smoke up your eyes with a darker shadow and team this with a foolproof nude lip - Michael Kors' Lip Lacquer in Diva would be my shade of choice!

And there you have it - Victoria's Secret style glamour made easy. If you'd like to try out this look, you can get all the products I used from online beauty boutique Escentual.com.

Now, any discerning beauty addict will know that first and foremost, you need to sort your skincare routine out before you can think about make-up.

Mummy Felstead and I are both huge fans of French pharmacy products, so we're very excited that Escentual.com have up to 1/3 off a plethora of skincare goodies from Caudalie, Vichy, Bioderma and many more!

If skincare confuses you and you're not sure what to choose, take a look at my skincare routine post, which will hopefully shed some light on the steps your regime should include: www.escentual.com/blog/2014/01/24/binkys-skincare-favourites/

I'll see you all next week - stay gorgeous!
