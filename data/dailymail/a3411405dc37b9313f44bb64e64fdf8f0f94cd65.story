Liverpool’s iconic captain Steven Gerrard has given his blessing to Jordan Henderson taking the job full-time after he retires and advised the key to good leadership is building one-to-one relationships with team-mates rather than screaming and shouting in an attempt to show authority.

Gerrard, 34, expressed his delight that Henderson was last week named the club’s vice-captain with a view to eventually carrying the armband on a permanent basis.

The current skipper believes he and 24-year-old Henderson share common values more significant than geography, with the younger man growing up in Sunderland 170 miles from Merseyside.

Gerrard said: ‘I think I see a lot of similarities between myself and the way I go about things day-to-day, and how Jordan does it as well.

‘I’m not an in-your-face captain shouting for the sake of it in the dressing room. All these captains that rant and rave and try to knock the paint off a dressing room door, it is a load of nonsense. What matters is how you perform every day in training and matches, and what constructive information you can give your team mates one-to-one. That is what is important as a captain.

‘Jordan epitomises everything a captain is. He leads by example, never gives up and works just as hard without the ball as with it.

‘We are good mates on and off the pitch and I would love nothing better than passing over the armband to him when I call it a day here, not just because he’s a great player but also a top lad.

‘He comes from a great family, a similar family to mine, so it’ll be a very proud day when I hand it over.’

Gerrard’s career as a local Liverpool lad made good is legendary whereas Henderson went through a tough time when he arrived at Anfield in the summer of 2011. Initially, he was considered over-priced at £18million and former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson even mocked his running style.

Gerrard thinks overcoming the difficult start, and winning over doubters in The Kop, have helped to prove Henderson has the qualities to be a captain.

‘He came to a huge football club like Liverpool as a young lad. He’s not the first person who has taken time to settle in,’ said Gerrard.

‘But I always knew watching him in and around the training ground that if he kept his head down, it would turn for him. Fans take to players who give 100 per cent even when things aren’t going well and eventually they come round.

When the pressure was on Jordan and the fans were on his back, he dug deep and worked even harder. A lot of players give up and end up falling down the leagues and going to clubs that are not as big because they can’t handle the pressure.

‘But he showed through thick and thin that he is prepared to dig deep and go in where it hurts to turn these fans round.’

Henderson is also now an England regular and will be one of the candidates to captain his country after Wayne Rooney.

Gerrard also gives his deputy credit for helping him to adapt to a deeper-lying midfield role.

‘Jordan has been great for me, especially at my age,’ he said. ‘What a story it will be if he becomes Liverpool’s full-time captain.’
