Supporter: Alan Duncan MP said the couple should have a right to defend their property

A government minister has issued an impassioned defence of two of his constituents, saying they should not be prosecuted for shooting two suspected burglars who allegedly broke into their remote farm cottage.

International Development Minister Alan Duncan, who is MP for Rutland and Melton, spoke out in support of homeowners Andy Ferrie, 35, and his wife Tracey, 43.

The couple were arrested in the early hours of Sunday after they were disturbed by the break-in at their home in the Welby area of Leicestershire, near Melton Mowbray.

They are presently being questioned by Leicestershire Police on suspicion of GBH.

It is understood Mr Ferrie grabbed a legally-owned shotgun and fired at two of the four intruders before calling the police himself.

Minister Mr Duncan said the Ferries should not face charges for defending their home.

'If this is a straightforward case of someone using a shotgun to defend themselves against burglars in the dead of night, then I would hope that the police will prosecute the burglars and not my constituents,' he said.

'The householder is the victim here and justice should support them and prosecute the burglars.'

Mr and Mrs Ferrie have reportedly been burgled three or four times at their 200-year-old farm cottage.

The couple had only been back in the property for four weeks - after moving out because they were fed up with being targeted - when crooks struck again.

Mr Ferrie's stepfather Maris Spilner, 60, said the couple, who have been married for four years, had decided to emigrate to Australia in 2013.

The service engineer said: 'In the time they have lived in the cottage, I think they have been broken into a couple of times at least, but I couldn’t say for definite.

'This is very out of character, we were very shocked when we heard on Sunday.

'But if someone breaks into your home its a violation of your privacy, I’m sure there was a very good reason for what has happened.

'We don’t know what went on, we haven’t spoken to either of them since it happened and no one will tell us anything.

'They haven’t lived in the property again for that long - a few months maybe.

'They were preparing for their move overseas, they were hoping to emigrate to Australia - for the weather mainly.'

Mr Spilner confirmed that the couple did have a gun licence but could not confirm for what type of firearm.

He said: 'They weren’t part of any gun club that I am aware of, but they did have a gun license.

'I have never seen the firearm.'

Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie

The couple - who have not been officially identified by police - run a caravan and motor home firm in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

They are being questioned by Leicestersire police today.

The Ferries are believed to have called the police immediately after the latest burglary at 12.26am on Sunday morning.

It is understood that the man who dialled 999 told officers he had fired his shotgun, which is licensed and legally held, and that the intruders fled.

Shortly after police received the emergency call they were alerted by the ambulance service that they had been called to the same address to treat a man with shotgun injuries.

The two wounded men, whose injuries are not life-threatening, were allegedly part of a four-man burglary team.

The four suspected burglars, aged 23, 27, 31, and 33, were all arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary where the injured pair were taken for treatment.

Police said they could not comment on whether the raiders had been armed.

Detectives and scenes of crime officers have cordoned off the stone cottage, and forensic investigations are underway.

Eve Hobill, whose family owns the land that the cottage is on, said today: 'We do not know what is happening, and we are not allowed to say anything.'

Local resident Ted Hutchin, 63, said the suspected break-in and shooting were a shock to the quiet, rural community.

He said: ‘I’m a former magistrate and Melton Mowbray has the usual crimes associated with a market town.

‘But in the immediate vicinity the worst crime we can remember is lead stolen from the church roof.’

Mr Hutchin said he had seen the police cordon outside the cottage on his way to church last night, adding: ‘I thought it was strange because this is such a quiet spot.’

The case is likely to reignite public debate over a householder’s right to defend his home against intruders.

In 1999, Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was arrested after shooting burglars during a break-in at his remote farmhouse. He did not have a firearms licence.

Fred Barras, 16, was killed and his friend Brendan Fearon, 29, suffered gunshot wounds to his legs.

Fearon later admitted conspiring to burgle the farmhouse, accompanied by Barras, but Martin was tried at Norwich Crown Court and jailed for life for murder in 2000.

His murder conviction was later reduced to manslaughter and he was released from jail in 2003.
