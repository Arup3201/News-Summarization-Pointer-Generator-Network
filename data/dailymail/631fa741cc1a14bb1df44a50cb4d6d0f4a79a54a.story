The six teenagers included in Arsene Wenger's squad for the final Champions League game of the group stage have the chance to play without fear, according to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

The England star, who will start in midfield on Tuesday night, says it is a fantastic opportunity for the youngsters to prove themselves.

Oxlade-Chamberlain praised the six, who have three first team appearances between them, for their quality and attitude, and insists they will be up to the task if called upon.

'All young players have to start somewhere and you have to be challenged at some point, so if they have the opportunity to play they have a chance to prove they are capable,' the Oxlade-Chamberlain explained.

'From what I have seen, they have all got good quality, they are all good lads and I am sure they will be up for the challenge and trying to prove to the boss they are good players.'

Chamberlain, who has been one of Arsenal's better performers in a disappointing start to the season, knows it will be up to the more experienced players in the squad to help their young team-mates.

'The pressures of the game at this level can be different for everyone,' he added. 'But when you're young you do play with no fear and that can be the best way to approach a big stage like the Champions League.

'The boys who have been here before have a responsibility to help the young ones to get through the game and cope with it.'

Arsenal have already reached the last 16 of the competition, but could go through as group winners if they beat Galatasaray and Anderlecht win in Dortmund.
