Riding on the wave of a serendipitous chart-topping single of Nick Clegg's apology for raising tuition fees, the Liberal Democrats are now selling memorabilia mugs saying 'I'm sorry'.

On the official opening day of the Lib Dem conference, in Brighton, the party embraced the spoof remix of leader Nick Clegg's youtube apology, selling mugs branded with his face and what has become the catchy line to the song's chorus.

The party leader's videoed apology went viral after satirical website The Poke quickly released a remix of what some feared would be a failed attempt to garner party support.

Opposition to Clegg's tuition fees apology were concerned the video would remind Lib Dem supporters of the party's broken promise, just as it had subsided in their memories.

However, the popularity of the catchy 'Autotune remix' has resulted in the sort of sort of publicity that money simply cannot buy.

Seizing upon its popularity, the party has wasted no time in creating memorabilia to build on the song's success.

After a year in which Lib Dem support has continued to decline, the party is likely to pounce on any opportunity to attract further interest.Â 

Will there be T-shirts, caps and key-rings branding Clegg's now infamous chorus: 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, the Liberal Democrats are sorry..' ?

The mugs proved popular with party members who arrived in Brighton this weekend for the start of the Liberal Democrats' annual conference

The party's annual conference, which gets going on Sunday, has already attracted media attention after officers were spotted seizing cycles from the seafront as part of a precautionary measure to prevent terrorists from planting so-called bike bombs.

The cycles were removed from bike racks just 100 yards from the Brighton Centre where Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will address the conference next week.

The Lib Dem leader and other high-ranking ministers are staying at the Grand Hotel, next to the Brighton Centre.

Security is tight as the spectre of the 1984 Brighton bombing, where IRA terrorists attempted to kill then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the Grand Hotel, still looms large.
