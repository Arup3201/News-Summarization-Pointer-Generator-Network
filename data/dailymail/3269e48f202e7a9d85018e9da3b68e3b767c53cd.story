A teacher who has a passion for fetish clothes and likes to wear Nazi-themed bondage outfits has changed her name to include all 26 letters of the alphabet.

The 36-year-old, who lives in the Colombian capital Bogota, has a habit of regularly changing her name and prior to the latest change was known as Ladyzunga Cyborg.

She admitted that officials had often raised eyebrows at her unusual names, but that her latest name change to become Abcdefg Hijklmn Opqrst Uvwxyz had involved her biggest battle yet.

She said that she had been fighting red tape for two years in order to finally get approval to now call herself Abcdefg Hijklmn Opqrst Uvwxyz.

The teacher, who is also a fashion designer, has a passion for fetish clothes and bondage events and said she always feels the need to constantly 'redefine' herself and felt that it was now appropriate to have a name that was hard to say.

She said: 'I've changed my name so people wouldn't know it's me.

'But it's not because I was disturbed by it but because I wanted to always bring an element of surprise.'

Ms Uvwxyz, who teaches art and photography at three universities as well as designing fashion on the side, regularly changes her name depending on her mood.

Daniel Molano, from the Colombian National Registry, said: 'If a civil notary had refused to modify her name in the civil registry, he would have broken his work obligations.

'Basically no matter how unusual, this is something that should always be allowed.'
