The Victorian Government is facing scrutiny for appointing Dr Sonia Sharp as a senior state education official, who has been linked to a shocking child abuse scandal in northern England for a 16-year period

The Victorian Government is facing scrutiny for appointing a senior state education official who has been linked to a shocking child abuse scandal in northern England for a 16-year period.

Between 1997 and 2013, children as young as 11 were sexually exploited by gangs of men – most of them of Pakistani origin.

At least 1,400 girls were left to be abused by Asian men because the authorities were too scared to admit there was a race issue.

Police and council officials in Rotherham suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist.

Now, questions are being raised as to why the Victorian Government would recruit the former director of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2006, Dr Sonia Sharp, as their deputy secretary of Victoria's Education Department.

'I think it absolutely raises questions about the recruitment policies, it raises questions about ongoing arrangements at the highest levels in the education department under the Liberal Government,' said Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews.

'This is not some junior bureaucrat, this is a senior, perhaps almost the most senior person... that is charged with the welfare and protection, the nourishment, the advancement, the education of our kids, there's answers that need to be provided to this and the Premier and the Minister are the ones to provide them.'

However, Dr Sharp's peers stand by their decision and hail her as an 'outstanding leader' who has helped strengthen Victoria's system.

'I think that's a matter for ministers, but my point here is that I'm informed that the recruitment process has operated in the normal way, the recruitment process was a straight-forward, normal recruitment process,' Victorian Health Minister David Davis said.

The devastating report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed that:

John
 Cameron of the NSPCC said there had been a collective blindness over 
the abuse which allowed devastating child sexual exploitation to go 
unchallenged.

The
 charity said; ‘This report is truly damning. Many of these children 
were already extremely vulnerable, and the manner in which they were let
 down by agencies entrusted to protect them is appalling.

‘It
 is hard to imagine the damage caused to victims who were preyed upon 
with almost impunity over many years, because of a reluctance to 
comprehend or address what was widely happening.’

It
 called for authorities to ensure that such failings should never be 
repeated and that ‘cultural sensitivities should never stand in the way 
of protecting children’.

Adam Pemberton of Victim Support said: ‘The extent of the sexual exploitation of young girls is horrific.

‘Almost
 as shocking as the details of that abuse is the abject failure on the 
part of social services to protect these children. Vulnerable girls were
 often not believed by the authorities because of their troubled 
backgrounds.

The report comes after two others done between 2002 and 2006 which 'could not have been clearer'

Although partially taking responsibility for the damage that was caused to the victims in Rotherham, Dr Sharp insists she did what she could at the time.

'As soon as I commenced in April 2005 as Rotherham's first director of children's services, I was briefed by politicians, senior managers and frontline staff about the issue of sexual exploitation of young people,' Dr Sharp said in a statement.

'We knew that there were many children in the community at risk and feared this was the tip of an iceberg.

'There was a lot to do: shifting attitudes, raising the quality of services for these vulnerable children, improving early identification and strategies for prevention and, importantly, getting agencies to work together to achieve convictions.

'You can't be the director of children's services and not take responsibility for what happens to children,' she said.

'I regret every case of exploitation of vulnerable girls that was not prevented, but feel strongly that our collective efforts led to gradual but essential improvements in the situation for many young people.'

Her leadership during that time was commended by Richard Bolt, the department secretary of The Victorian Education Department.

'I have no doubt that Sonia tackled the issue of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham with maximum commitment, professionalism and focus,' Mr Bolt said in a statement.

'In the report there are numerous references to important changes made under Sonia's management that led to sustained and systemic improvement.

'There is considerable evidence not included in the report which reinforces my view.'

And Mr Bolt is not the only one from The Department to praise Dr Sharp's work with the Victorian Education Department.

A spokesperson for the National Centre Against Bullying said, 'Sonia Sharp is a representative of the Victorian Education Department on the National Centre Against Bullying.

'Sonia is known internationally for her work on tackling bullying in schools and was invited to share this knowledge with the National Centre Against Bullying.'

But despite the approval given by Dr Sonia's peers, Jane
 Collins, Ukip’s Yorkshire and Humber MEP, said, ‘I categorically call 
for the resignation of everyone directly and indirectly involved in this
 case.

'The Labour Council stand accused of deliberately ignoring child 
sex abuse victims for 16 years. The apologies we have heard are totally 
insincere and go nowhere near repairing the damage done.

‘I
 also call for a criminal investigation by a force not directly linked 
with this scandal in to all those implicated in this scandal. There is 
no place for these people in public life.’

And
 at least six victims have now launched a class action against Rotherham
 council and could be in line for millions of pounds in compensation.
