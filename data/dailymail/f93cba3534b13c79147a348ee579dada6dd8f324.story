A teenager has shot dead his father to save his mother from being choked and beaten, according to police.

Channing Thorpe, 17, repeatedly shot at his father, 36-year-old Christopher Thorpe, as the man beat his wife, 35-year-old Jill Thorpe, in their Plant City, Florida mobile home on Saturday night.

The killing came after a group of friends and family had gathered outside the home on Burnt Barn Avenue around 10pm. The couple went inside and began arguing, police said.

As the fight escalated, Mr Thorpe began beating his wife, and they moved from the living room to their bedroom.

Channing Thorpe rushed into the room to see the scuffle and fired several shots from a handgun and struck his father, police said. Mr Thorpe died at the scene.

Channing Thorpe called 911 at 10.15pm to say he had killed his father and officers found him dead in the bedroom. Mrs Thorpe was also shot in the thigh and was treated at hospital and later released.

Channing Thorpe was not arrested and was released into his mother's custody.

The Sheriff's Office will continue to investigate, spokeswoman Debbie Carter said, and then hand the case over to the State Attorney's office, which will decide whether to press charges.

According to a police report, 'numerous 
firearms' were inside the property, as family members were ardent 
hunters and neighbours noted Mr Thorpe often carried a gun.

The three other people at the bonfire - 
Channing's maternal grandmother, his girlfriend and a friend - did not 
witness the shooting, according to authorities.

The Tampa Bay Times
reported that the family had no criminal records or domestic violence 
orders for protection. Sheriffs added that they had not been sent to the
home in the past year.

Mr Thorpe's mother, Evelyn Thorpe, 64, told the paper she was stunned to learn of the killing.

'I had never, ever seen three people that
were so close,' she said. 'All three of them did 
everything together. Everything. I just can't understand it.'

Neighbor Bill Dunlap, 60, said he 
was not aware of any domestic violence at the home but claimed Mr Thorpe had a bad temper.

'He was always ready for a confrontation,' Dunlap said. 'I didn't really like him.

'Chris
thought of himself as the ruler of the roost and I guess Jill just got 
tired of it. He thought all women loved him and all women
were second-class citizens.'

The family has lived at the address since 2002, when Jill Thorpe and her mother bought the 1,400 square-foot mobile home they both lived in with Channing and Christopher.

Mr Thorpe worked as a quality control inspector for Sensenich Propellers, an aircraft and airboat parts manufacturing company in Plant City.

Channing Thorpe, a Plant High School student, has also worked there for about a year, neighbours said, while Jill Thorpe manages a nearby sandwich shop.
