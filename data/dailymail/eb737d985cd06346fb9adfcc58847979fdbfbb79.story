A doting father who showered his teenage daughter with luxuries including a £20,000 birthday party where Tulisa performed, Gucci bags and a £1,500 mobile has been jailed after breaching a bankruptcy court order.

Businessman Harby Panesar, 45, threw the celebrity-style bash complete with a guest performance by Tulisa from N-Dubz and a personal video from Hollywood star Nicole Kidman for his daughter Anysha's 16th birthday.

He then spent thousands bankrolling Anysha’s dream to be a top teenage model and beauty queen who went on to be crowned America’s Perfect Teen and the first international cover girl on SuperModels magazine.

Bankrupt: Harby Panesar, left, who gave his daughter Anysha, right, a luxury lifestyle, has been sentenced to nine months in prison after breaching a court order preventing him from setting up any new companies

But less than three years later Panesar was declared bankrupt when his finance business collapsed - ending their lavish lifestyle.

Panesar made his money through his insurance company Motorcare Warranties. 

An investigation into the collapsed business by the Financial Services Authority found that the company left a trail of victims whose motor insurance policies were worthless.

A bankruptcy hearing in the High Court banned Panesar from setting up a new business and all his assets were frozen.

Mr Panesar and his father-in-law, Anthony Hopkin William Thomas, were both found in contempt of court after a judge ruled they had been involved in breaching a freezing order on their company by setting up a new business named Motorcare Elite.

The court heard Panesar transferred 
assets to the new company from its predecessor Motorcare Warranties, 
which had underpaid partner company, Templeton, by at least £2.3million.

The new firm’s website described the business as 'an established family-owned company that has built up an excellent reputation over the years'.

Anysha, now 19, begged a judge not to send her dad to prison but he said he said he had no choice but jail him.

Judge Bernard Eder told him: 'Pleas for mercy from your daughter were a cry from the heart.

'Sending you to prison will no doubt have a devastating effect on your family but I have no option but to jail you.'

Panesar doted on Anysha, lavishing her with gifts and encouraging her to live a life of luxury.

He bought his daughter a Gucci handbag for her birthday, along with a £1,500 personalised mobile phone and a pair of £400 sunglasses.

He threw a Moulin Rouge-themed party and Anysha wore a £3,000 replica of a Nicole Kidman dress from the hit film.

Musicians N-Dubz and DJ Ironik provided entertainment while there was a £500 rotating Moulin Rouge cake.

At the time of her birthday party, he said: 'If any parents are going to have a Super Sweet 16 party I would suggest that they have very long pockets and very long arms to reach in to those pockets.'

He was sentenced to nine months jail and Thomas four months, but both were granted bail pending appeal.

Judge Eder said: 'These are the shortest prison sentences which are consistent with the circumstances of the case.'

'I have no doubt he played a crucial role in setting up Motorcare Elite and running the new business.'

Panesar, 45, and his wife Caroline, 43, now face losing their luxury £500,000 home and their six-acre estate in the Vale of Glamorgan.
