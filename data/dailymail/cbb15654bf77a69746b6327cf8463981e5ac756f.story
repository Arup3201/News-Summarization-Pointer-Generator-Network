A Pennsylvania family is suing Babies R Us and a New Jersey furniture manufacture for more than $350,000 over a dresser which fell on two toddler sisters and crushed them to death last July 4.

According to TimesOnline, a wrongful death lawsuit filed in Beaver County court alleges the drawers that crushed Ryeley, three, and Brooklyn Beatty, two, were 'improperly designed for use in a child’s environment'.

The suit also claims the product - weighing 124lbs - did not have an 'anchoring strap' to prevent it from falling. It was manufactured by Baby Cache Inc. of Piscataway.

Source of the problem: Authorities were seen removing the dresser similar to this product found on Babies R Us webpage from the scene

The girls' mother, Jennifer Beatty, and grandmother, Pamela Warnick, apparently purchased the item from a Babies R Us store in Cranberry in early 2010.

It was a shop floor model that was being sold on clearance.

Attorney Deborah DeCostro alleges the dresser was 'improperly packaged and/or boxed at the time it was sold' and did not come labeled with  safety warnings.

A Babies' R Us employee is also said to be facing allegations for not alerting Beatty and Warnick to the 'faults'. 

Officials from the retailer and the dresser company didn't immediately respond to the Associated Press seeking comment on the lawsuit.

The dresser fell on Ryeley and Brooklyn in their Aliquippa home on July 4 2014.

Brooklyn died that day and Ryeley two days later.

It was reported that the sisters had been playing in or around the bottom drawer of the dresser, causing it to fall onto them.

They were home alone with their father, 28-year-old David Beatty, at the time.  

Tragic accident: An autopsy doctor testified that the girls could have been saved had their father helped them immediately after hearing the dresser crash down 

Deadly: Authorities were seen removing the dresser at the scene

He and his wife are currently facing charges of child endangerment.

Authorities described the condition of their home at the time of the dresser incident as 'deplorable' with clothing, trash, dog  and human feces strewn about.

David Beatty was also facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter but these charges have since been dropped following a hearing in January.

It was said that he didn't immediately respond to his daughters after hearing a bang.

An autopsy doctor testified that the girls could have been saved had he helped them immediately after hearing the  crash.

However, Beatty’s defense attorney, Kevin Kindred, argued he did not consciously disregard a dangerous situation.

He described it as a 'tragic accident' adding that the home's condition was being unfairly linked to the deaths.

Under investigation: While they take action against Babies R Us, David and Jennifer Beatty (pictured with Brooklyn, right) are facing child endangerment charges for keeping their toddlers in 'deplorable' conditions
