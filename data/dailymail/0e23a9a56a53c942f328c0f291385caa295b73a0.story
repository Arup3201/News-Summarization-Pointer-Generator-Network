Trials to dissuade addiction by providing heroin addicts with 'rewards' for staying clean have been taking place all over the UK

Heroin addicts are to be given weekly £10 supermarket vouchers in a bid to help them give up their habit.

The NHS will reward drug users with the vouchers for remaining clean during a 12-week treatment programme – meaning they could ‘earn’ up to £120 in total.

The trial – which is taking place at 33 sites around Britain – follows a study by researchers who found that the number of heroin addicts who completed a course of three hepatitis B jabs soared when they were rewarded with shopping vouchers.

The researchers said the financial incentive had been a ‘game-changer’ and could have a huge impact on drug treatment as well as other public health initiatives.

The study was led by Professor John Strang from the National Addiction Centre at King’s College London, working with colleagues from Imperial College London and University College London.

Almost half of those given graduated payments – £5 for the first jab, followed by subsequent payments of £10 and £15 – attended all three appointments, according to a report in The Lancet medical journal.

Professor Strang said the ethics of giving financial incentives to drug addicts was a matter for ‘wider debate’ but added that it would be a ‘massive saving in terms of efficiency of the delivery’ of the vaccination programme.

‘Why would you not want to do a vaccination programme where you get 45 per cent uptake?’ he said.

Professor John Strang, one of the country's top experts on drug dependence, has been leading the scheme, and argues that monetary incentives are a good way to ensure most are vaccinated

‘I can understand the anxieties. Suggesting this at a time of austerity is difficult but are you really going to shirk from making a difficult decision which is cost-saving?’

The research team conceded it was possible that addicts might trade in the vouchers to feed their habit, but said that the evidence suggested otherwise.

Almost 700 addicts are being recruited for the trial, all of whom want to stop taking drugs. Some will get reward vouchers if their urine tests are clean or they are taking their medication over a three-month period.

Professor Strang said the success of the hepatitis B study suggests the approach should be rolled out nationwide to boost vaccine uptake, given that one in five of 250,000 injecting drug users in the UK has the virus.

The costs to the NHS of treating the disease were high, as was the human cost of potential transmission to their families, he added.

He said there was scope for financial incentives to help in other ways, such as encouraging people to take statin drugs, or for the homeless to finish a course of TB treatment.

However Joyce Robins, co-director of the campaign group Patient Concern, questioned whether addicts should be paid for changing their ways.

‘In a time of austerity this is not the best way of spending taxpayers’ money,’ she said.

More must be done to help the rising tide of people who are injecting themselves with steroids, health experts have also warned.

Reports suggest the number of people, including teenagers, who use steroids and other performance or image enhancing drugs is 'rapidly increasing', the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said.

Outreach programmes should be set up in gyms to try to reach this group of drug users, Nice said.

People who use these drugs do not see themselves as having a drug problem, a Nice spokesman said.

In fact, they see themselves as 'fit and healthy' despite the fact that people who inject themselves with any type of drug are at a heightened risk of HIV and hepatitis.

Nice warned that anabolic steroid use is 'relatively widespread' with an estimated 59,000 people aged 16 to 59 using the drug in England and Wales in the last year.

But Nice said these estimates are 'conservative' and said that needle and syringe programmes have reported 'rapidly increasing' numbers of steroid users attending their services.

David Rourke, harm reduction lead for Arundel Street Project - a needle and syringe programme in Sheffield, said: 'We run a weekly clinic for steroid users but we have people coming through the door on a daily basis, with at least seven new clients a week.

'We know there are many more people out there who are not using needle and syringe programmes because this group of users do not see themselves as drug users. Traditionally they are more sexually active than users of heroin or crack, so there is more potential for the spread of infections through sex.

'People who inject steroids are potentially using them without the correct education or the correct equipment and this can lead to more and more people injecting unsafely, which can put not just their own life, but the lives of those around them, at risk.

'Those who use steroids should be able to get the same support as anyone else who injects drugs. This guideline will make sure that services across the country are at the high standard they should be.'
