A model has revealed how she exposed a fashion photographer and rapist who preyed on his subjects - by blogging about her experiences with him. 

Roswell Ivory, 26, was sexually abused by Shaun Colclough, 40, at his studio in Hackney Wick, East London, but had no idea he had done the same to others until she shared her story.

Ms Ivory told how he deliberately made her feel vulnerable, asked intimate questions about her sex life and straddled her.

He was jailed for seven years on August 2 for sexually abusing two women, with Judge Sheelagh Canavan saying he clearly enjoyed the 'humiliation and degradation of women'.

Ms Ivory, who specialises in alternative and fetish-style clothing and art nudes, spoke of how Colclough behaved erratically and tried to dominate her by destroying her self-esteem.

She first realised she was not alone when she told another model about what had happened during a fashion show in Barcelona. 

'She just went white,' Ms Ivory said. 'She told me what happened to her and it was exactly the same, the same sentences, the same pattern [of behaviour].'

She then decided to use her popular blog to ask if any other models had had bad experiences in Hackney Wick, though did not name Colclough himself.

She said about ten girls wrote back to her, each one of them naming him explicitly.

Her next step was to contact the police, not knowing that a 27-year-old part-time model had already registered a similar complaint after enduring seven and a half hours of horror with the predator.

The police had investigated him and seized his computer, but decided that it would be too risky to prosecute with it being just one word against another.

But after Ms Ivory's complaint and the resulting court case at Snaresbrook Crown Court, Colclough was found guilty of sexually abusing both women.

Similar complaints had also been made by three other woman, but he was acquitted of three other charges, including indecently assaulting Ms Ivory and of indecently exposing himself to another model. 

During the trial it emerged that Colclough had previously served a six-year sentence for raping an 85-year-old woman in her own home in 1996, when he was aged just 22. 

The court also heard how he would bully the girls into striking explicitly sexual poses, tell them to perform oral sex on him and force their legs apart when they refused to do open-leg shots.

Ms Ivory first contacted Colclough in January 2011, as she wanted to update her portfolio with some artistic nude and fashion photos.

His website showed that he had worked for some of the world's top international agencies, including Premier, Oxygen and IMG. 'Usually I get references from other models,' she said, 'but because he worked with all these big agencies I thought he must be wonderful.' 

Ms Ivory told how Colclough tried to make her feel vulnerable and lower her self-esteem

However, she quickly began to feel uncomfortable with what Colclough was asking her to do. 

'For a fashion shoot you always wear make-up and do your hair but he insisted on no make-up or styling,' she told The Times. 'This was his way of lowering my self-esteem. He knew I would feel vulnerable doing 'fashion' without make-up.' 

She continued: 'He walked towards me with the camera repeatedly saying "you are vulnerable, you are very vulnerable" until he was right up to me.'

Ms Ivory broke down in tears when she saw the mugshots he took for the first time in court. 

Judge Sheelagh Canavan told him: 'You targeted these women on the basis that they were likely to be vulnerable and unlikely to stand up to you.'

The judge added he had completed a sexual offenders course in prison, and a second one when he was released into the community.

She said: 'You've had, if you were ever going to, the tools and opportunity to put your offending behind you.'

Ms Ivory shouted as he was led down from the dock: 'You look vulnerable to me.'
