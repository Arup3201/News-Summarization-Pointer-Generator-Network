A Queensland teenager who stands accused of stabbing a classmate said that he was attempting to scare him into ending his bullying behaviour.

The 16-year-old said he wanted to 'jab' the other boy, and has pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding, but maintains he is not guilty to the charge of attempted murder or wounding in an attempt to maim or disfigure.

The boy, who cannot be named, was 14 when he stabbed his fellow year ten student with a kitchen knife at a Brisbane school in August 2013.

A Queensland teenager who stands accused of stabbing a classmate said that he was attempting to scare him into ending his bullying behaviour

The teenager said that he had been inspired by computer games when he devised a plan to scare the other student, who was not seriously injured in the attack.

The 16-year-old alleged that the boy had repeatedly bullied him, and he decided to bring the knife to school hidden in his blazer, and brandish it at the classmate.

During the course of the day, the boy pushed the 16-year-old's head, causing him to change his mind.  

'I started thinking, maybe if I jab him with it then he'll get really afraid and definitely not do that stuff any more,' the teenager told the Brisbane Supreme Court.

The boy, who cannot be named, brought his classmate to the school auditorium where he stabbed him in side of the neck.

'The original plan was to quickly just nick him with it and ... say to him, like, "This is what's going to happen to you except worse if you keep on bullying people", the boy said in the witness stand.

The boy brought his classmate to the school auditorium where he stabbed him in side of the neck.

Despite 'freaking out', the 16-year-old said that he thought 'I have to go through with this. He's not going to change ... and so I went through with it.'

The accused said he panicked and raced off when the victim made a gargling sound, thinking he had caused serious injury.

He dialled triple-zero and said, 'I think I just killed someone.'

The court has previously heard the wound was more than 5cm deep, and that the teenager decided to stab his classmate in the neck because it had fat and 'nothing important'.

The accused agreed he had earlier told a friend he was going to kill the victim, but said had not meant it and was just 'venting anger'.

The judge-only trial continues.
