The ‘ludicrous’ prosecution of a doctor for female genital mutilation has created a climate of fear in which other medics are too scared to do their jobs, it was claimed yesterday.

A jury took fewer than 25 minutes to acquit Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, of carrying out the potentially lethal procedure on a new mother. Another man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, was also cleared of abetting the offence.

The Crown Prosecution Service is now under pressure to defend its decision to pursue the case – the first in the UK. It is facing accusations that the case was nothing more than a ‘show trial’ which risked diverting attention from genuine victims of the crime.

Cleared: A jury took just 25 minutes to clear Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena of performing FGM after hearing  the 32-year-old was faced with a 'nightmarish scenario' when a patient cut at the age of six went into labour

Doctors and lawyers said the ‘insulting’ prosecution had risked making other doctors fearful of treating FGM victims.

Dr Pallavi Bradshaw, medicolegal adviser at the Medical Protection Society said: ‘We need to be mindful that in pursuing criminal investigations of doctors, we do not create a climate of fear and undermine the much-needed culture of openness.’ 

Andrea James of Shoosmiths solicitors, which specialises in representing doctors, said she found it ‘difficult to understand’ why the CPS thought it an appropriate first case to prosecute under the FGM Act.

She said there was ‘a very clear exemption’ in the act for professionals involved with childbirth. She added: ‘There is a definite risk that it will put doctors off treating victims of FGM. What I have seen from clients of ours who are obstetricians and gynaecologists is that they are extremely concerned about this case and they are saying that they do not want to undertake treatment (of FGM victims) unless their hospital has very clear procedures in place.’

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders has come under fire over the timing of the announcement of the prosecution

Dr Katrina Erskine, a consultant at Homerton Hospital in East London added: ‘I thought it was ludicrous and insulting to survivors of FGM to equate anything that a midwife or a doctor does immediately after childbirth to what happens to young girls in terms of FGM.’

During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the jury was told the alleged victim had been subjected to FGM as a six year-old in Somalia. She went into emergency labour at the Whittington Hospital in North London on November 24, 2012, and Dr Dharmasena had to make an incision to allow safe delivery of the baby. 

The prosecution said the way he repaired the incision – with a single figure-of-eight stitch – amounted to FGM. They said he acted under pressure from Mr Mohamed to reinstate her FGM after the birth.

But Dr Dharmasena said the stitch was needed to stop the woman bleeding. The woman herself did not support the prosecution but he was arrested and suspended from his job after a midwife complained.

The CPS announced the decision to charge both men with great fanfare in March last year.

But there were questions over the timing of the announcement, which came just days before Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was due to appear before MPs to explain why there had been no FGM prosecutions in the UK. 

Asked yesterday on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if she thought it was the ‘wrong case’ to pursue, she said: ‘The legislation is designed to make FGM a crime no matter who commits it… The classic case is a young girl who has been cut, normally there are family or friends involved, the chances of a young girl coming into a police station to make a complaint about that are remote. That classic case is going to be a very difficult one to find.’

GPs will be forced to report cases of FGM and flag up girls who are thought to be at risk, under a raft of measures to be announced today.

As part of the action, a system will be introduced which will allow clinicians to note on a child’s health record that they are potentially at risk of FGM. It will also become mandatory for GPs and mental health trusts to record cases of FGM. Hospitals are already required to do so.

There will also be improved training for frontline health workers on how to communicate sensitively with patients about FGM.

FGM dates back at least 2,000 years. In some cultures it is valued as a rite of passage from childhood to womanhood. Others believe it preserves a girl’s virginity until marriage.
