A mother's frustration is ‘growing by the day’ as she and her family wait for their insurers to accept liability for the damage done to their home in the Somerset Levels.

The Kirby family were forced to abandon their Moorland cottage where they lived for 17 years when defences protecting their village failed at the height of the floods.

Now Kate and husband Mark, both 44, are battling a ‘long-winded claim process’ that means they won’t receive an insurance pay-out for months.

Long-winded: Kate and Mark Kirby and their family say they won't see a penny until insurers assess their flooded cottage in Somerset

‘We’ve been told we won’t see any money until the insurers can access our house and look at the damage,’ said the teaching assistant.

‘But we know that will take about six weeks. Until then we won’t know what we’re going to get, let alone actually see a penny.

‘It’s frustrating because it’s obvious to a blind man what has happened to our property.

‘Everything feels like it is moving in slow motion.’

When the flood waters poured into Jeanette Shipp’s home, she thought she could rest easy in the knowledge she had paid her insurance premium for years.

But her insurers have now told her the £450-a-year package was invalid – because she lives 200 yards from a river.

Christmas Eve was the first time the 59-year-old’s home in Fetcham, Surrey, had flooded in the 28 years she has lived there.

The river Mole is out of sight, beyond other houses, and when Mrs Shipp last filled out an insurance form four years ago she did not disclose there was a river nearby. She is now living in the upper storey of her soaked home.

To make matters worse, when the insurance firm first sent contractors to her home to start to assess and repair the damage, they dumped most of her undamaged furniture on the lawn outside.

‘It was left in the rain, the settee was ruined, and then people came along in vans and stole most of the other stuff,’ said the mother of three.

‘Then, two and a half weeks after the floods, the loss adjuster called and said I wasn’t insured at all. I’m still waiting to hear back from the insurance firm.’

Jane Matthews, 47, was forced to move out after 3ft of dirty water came spilling into her home four weeks ago.

She used to have insurance but after she made an £8,000 claim when her home was flooded last year she was unable to find anyone to provide cover.

The part-time supermarket worker now faces an estimated £24,000 bill to repair the home in Moorland, Somerset, which belongs to her parents.

Jane, who has moved into a nearby holiday park with daughter Louise, 16, said: ‘When it was up for renewal we just couldn’t get anyone to cover because of the flooding risk.

Last year we had about £8,000 of work done and it was only completed in July. Now it is ruined all over again and it is much worse this time.’

Insurance bosses met with government ministers in Downing Street to discuss their response to the continuing flooding, which has affected many parts of southern and south-west England

Suzanne Stevens’ home in Tyne and Wear is uninsurable after she made a claim for damage caused by flooding in June 2012.

The full-time mother said she is ‘worried to leave her home unattended’ now that the building and its contents are not covered.

Mrs Stevens said she and her husband Ian, both 41, feel they have been deserted at the time when they needed help the most.

‘It’s unjust that we have paid into a policy, year after year and you hope you never have to make a claim,’ she said.

‘But then the worst happens, and when you ask for help, the consequences are horrendous.

‘The insurance companies wouldn’t touch us with a barge pole after making the claim.’

The woman who confronted David Cameron in the street in December after her 17th-century home was flooded on Christmas Eve has given up with her insurance firms.

Ericka Olivares and her husband Pablo pay £2,300 a year to insure their £275,000 home in Yalding, Kent, and the premium comes with a huge excess of £5,000. It means the couple have decided not to claim for the flood damage.

‘The excess means if we claim, for example, £10,000 for the cost of replacing what we’ve lost in the flood, our insurers will only give us £5,000,’ said Mrs Olivares, 49, who met Treasury minister Danny Alexander in Yalding yesterday.

‘It doesn’t seem worth it, given our premium and excess will probably go up so much it will become unaffordable if we claim.’
