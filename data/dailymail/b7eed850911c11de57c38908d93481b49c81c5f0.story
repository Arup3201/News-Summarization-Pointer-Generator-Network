Struggling: The publishers of Penthouse are filing for bankruptcy after amassing $300million worth of debt

The publisher of adult magazine Penthouse has filed for bankruptcy with $300million of debt.

The magazine has seen a sharp drop in sales as a result of the rise of free adult content on the internet and is now looking for investors to cover their losses.

California-based FriendFinder Networks, who own the publication, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday after losing $49.4 million last year, and $10.3 million in the past quarter.

But the company said it has reached an agreement with key stakeholders to keep the magazine on the shelves and return control to its founders.

However, founded by Bob Guccione, whose monthly circulation is now said to be 175,000 down from 5 million at its peak, may be snapped up by New Jersey-born entrepreneur Jeremy Frommer.

Last year, Mr Frommer acquired a trove of memorabilia owned by the late Guc­cione that included nude photos of Madonna and a picture of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger engaged in a sex act. He is now the CEO of the Guccione Collection.

Today, Mr Frommer told MailOnline: 'I would  like to see the Penthouse brand restored to its former glory and carry on the legacy of Bob Guccione.' However, he would not comment on ongoing discussions.

Chief
 executive Anthony Previte, said: 'The Chapter 11 filing is the most 
efficient and cost-effective way for the company to implement the 
transaction support agreement while continuing to operate our business.'

'All
 operations will continue as normal throughout this process. 
Importantly, nothing about the user experience is going to change and we
 anticipate that all of our affiliates will continue to be paid in the 
ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 process.'

Penthouse was founded in 1965 as a rival to Hugh Hefner's Playboy. Bob Guccione began publishing the magazine in Britain in 1965 and four years later in the United States, 
earning him a fortune of around $400 million by the 1980's.

However, the rise in popularity of the internet badly affected sales and several bad business deals put publishers General Media in financial trouble.

Drop in sales: The magazine has struggled to compete with the availability of free adult content on the internet. Its founder Bob Guccione (right) died in 2010 after the company was taken over by FriendFinder Networks

History: Founder of Penthouse Magazine, Bob Guccione, when the magazine started in 1965

In 2003 the company declared itself 
bankrupt after defaulting on its loans, but restarted the following year and
 was renamed Penthouse Media Group.

Mr Guccione left the company soon after the deal and died of cancer in 2010, aged 79.

Besides
 publishing Penthouse, FriendFinder Networks operates a number of 
adult-oriented social networking sites including AdultFriendFinder.com, 
Amigos.com, AsiaFriendFinder.com and SeniorFriendFinder.com.

The group said holders of most of the 
secured debt agreed to the plan, which will now need approval by a 
bankruptcy court in Delaware.

The
 plan would convert some of the debt to new stock, and the 
existing shares would be cancelled.
