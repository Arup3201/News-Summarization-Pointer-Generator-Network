As days of almost relentless downpours blighted parts of the country for much of December, it seems hard to believe that this time last year water reserves were worryingly low due to a lack of rainfall.

But now figures have emerged showing a tale of two very different years - 2011 was the driest year in England for 90 years while 2012 was the wettest since records began in 1910.

Last year's drought across England forced water companies in the worst-affected areas to start using river water to top up reservoirs.

From sunshine to rain: While 2011 (left) was exceptionally dry, 2012 
(right) was England's soggiest year since 1910. (Brown areas are driest,
while blue are wettest)

But exactly a year later strong rain has
left communities counting the cost of flooding as rivers burst their 
banks, struggling to contain the heavy deluge of rain.

Hundreds of alerts have been issued 
by the Environment Agency this month, as several days' worth of rain has
fallen in just a few hours at its worst, contributing to a year of bad 
weather which has left the UK on the brink of its wettest since records 
began in 1910.

Homes have been evacuated and weary 
commuters and travellers have been forced to find alternative routes or 
abandon their plans altogether as sections of Britain's transport 
network ground to a halt.

What a difference a year makes: Ardingly Resevoir in Ardingly, West Sussex, at 12% of its capacity in 2011, and the same view (bottom) taken this year showing the increasing water level at the reservoir

But earlier in the year 2012 looked set to be a year defined by drought. 

In February the dry spell threatened 
the UK's landscape and in April a hosepipe ban was introduced to 
conserve vital water, but recent strong rain has left 
communities counting the cost of flooding.

Now forecasters have said 2012 is set to become the wettest on record in the UK after predicting a wet and windy 
end to the year as flood-battered areas were warned they face renewed 
danger from storms.

According to the Met office just 
1.8in (46mm) of rain is needed to fall before December 31 to make this 
year the wettest on record for the UK overall, with a new record already
set for England with 43.1in (1,095.8mm) falling between January 1 and Boxing Day.

Warning:
Low levels in Ogston Reservoir in Derbyshire last year. 
2011 was the driest year in England Wales for 90 years and the 
environment agency has warned that without rain in the near future, 
England will 
experience a severe drought

Dried up: The River Kennet in Wiltshire was reduced to a trickle in December 2011 after months of low rainfall

The UK as a whole had 50.8in 
(1,291.2mm) of rain from January 1 to December 26, with the wettest year
on record for the UK currently 2000, when 52.6in (1,337.3mm) fell.

Confirmation is expected next week, 
and would be all the more remarkable considering the drought status 
declared for parts of the country during the early part of the year.

In terms of temperature and sunshine the
year as a whole is set to be unremarkable, both being around normal.

However, overall 2012 is set to be cooler than 2011, but warmer than 
2010.

Swan lake: Worcester is one of many towns across the UK to suffer serious flooding after torrential rainfall in the last week

Fresh deluge: A few brave walkers head out out on a wet and windy Brighton seafront as the south of England is again lashed with rain

Strong winds: Storms, gale force winds and huge waves batter the promenade and seafront of Aberystwyth, on the west coast of UK on the last Sunday of 2012

But after a year dominated by rain, 2012 could actually end on a dry note.

Although more downpours are predicted
today, organisers of New Year’s Eve firework parties have been told 
they can look forward to a mostly clear evening.

Weathermen say wet conditions could 
linger in London and the South East during the day, but should clear by 
the time revellers venture out.

However, night-time temperatures will
be well down on last year, when southern England enjoyed a balmy 10C 
(50F) – warmer than Morocco.

Much of northern Britain can expect a frost, while the South will see a noticeable dip to around 4C (39F).

Wet wet wet: 2012 is already the rainiest year on record for England, and just 1.8 inches away from being the rainiest ever seen for the whole of the UK, with four days of December to go
