A Tory MP caused a Twitter storm today after claiming that Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli had turned up at the House of Commons to listen in on a Government drug debate.

Guy Opperman was so sure he had spotted the famous footballer that he breathlessly tweeted his 5,000 followers: 'Mario Balotelli has popped in to Commons gallery'.

The tweet, sent during a debate on the merits of decriminalisation, added that he was donning 'a sharp suit, pink shirt and a poppy'.

Guy Opperman was so sure he'd spotted the famous footballer that he breathlessly tweeted his 5,000 followers: 'Mario Balotelli has popped in to Commons gallery'

The apparent sighting sparked excitement in Parliament, with members of the press craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the Italian player.

But they soon realised Mr Opperman was mistaken - and the man was actually a 55-year-old with a similar Balotelli-style mohawk.

The man in question was later revealed to be Ken Hinds, a dancer and activist who has worked as a mediator for Scotland Yard.

After the initial tweet, journalist David Wooding said: 'Balotelli lookalike in the public gallery for the drugs law debate. Some MPs think it's actually the Liverpool striker! (Why always him?)' 

The former Manchester City star had the words 'Why always me?' printed on his shirts, after a series of headlines about his bizarre behaviour. 

And Press Association's Arj Singh commented: 'Definitely not Balotelli... Mohawk is too thin and old Mario will be training. Just been to see for myself.'  

The apparent recognition sparked excitement in the house, with members of the press craning their necks to see whether the spot was genuine

Reporters soon worked out the man was not in fact Balotelli but Ken Hinds, 55, an activist and dancer 

After the confusion was settled, Mr Hinds explained how several MPs had asked him if he was Balotelli - but that he had to 'disappoint them and say no'.  

He told The Telegraph: 'I was sitting down watching the debate and I was approached by a number of MPs asking me if I was Balotelli.

'I had to disappoint them and say no - but he is a great man and I am only privileged to associated with man like that.'
