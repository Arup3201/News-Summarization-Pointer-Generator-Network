A woman who called Aboriginal people 'wasters' says she will be using her experience of visiting remote indigenous communities to help her through her marriage breakdown.

Bo-dene Stieler, from Melbourne, appeared in SBS series First Contact that saw six 'ordinary' Australians immerse themselves in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the indigenous population.

At the beginning of the three-part series, Ms Stieler did not have a positive opinion of Australia's first inhabitants.

At the beginning of the three-part series, Bo-dene Stieler labelled Aboriginal people as 'wasters'

'When I think of Aboriginal people, I think of "wasters",' she said initially.

But when Ms Stieler came back from her three-week trip to the Northern Territory and Western Australia not only had her views changed, but so had her home life.

When she arrived home she found out her husband of three years had moved out. 

Ms Stieler said she felt her world had fallen apart and felt humiliated by the marriage break-up.

On Thursday's episode, she does a complete 360 on her views, saying she was 'ashamed' of what she thought about indigenous Australians

But without her experience through First Contact, the Melbourne woman did not think she would have found the strength to go on.

'If I hadn't done the trip, I know that I would not have been able to handle the prospects of being alone,' she wrote. 

'I had to be brave and draw inspiration from the amazing women I had met, especially June Oscar in Fitzroy Crossing, to not surrender to adversity.'

During Thursday's episode of First Contact, the group travelled to Roebourne Prison where 90 per cent of inmates were indigenous and to Fitzroy Crossing - a community that fought to ban full-strength alcohol to reduce violence in the community.

In an article she wrote for SBS, Ms Stieler reveals she came home to find out her husband of three years had left her, but due to her experiences on the show she thinks she can build a new life again

Having had these experiences, Ms Stieler said she now felt 'ashamed' about what she had thought about indigenous Australians.

'Before the journey, I would never have thought that my biggest life inspiration would come from Aboriginal people,' she said. 

'Looking back, I can't believe the ignorance I showed and the disrespect I showed by not even taking the pro-active approach to find out more and just believing everything that I had been told.'

Thursday's episode of First Contact was less controversial than Wednesday's, where one participant, Sandy, lied to producers about getting her nails done before escaping on a flight back to Sydney.

The mother-of-five, 41, is of Syrian, German and Caucasian descent, and the father of her children is Maori.

On the show, she claimed Aboriginals had 'whinged too much' about the stolen generation of children snatched from their parents to be brought up in white society.
