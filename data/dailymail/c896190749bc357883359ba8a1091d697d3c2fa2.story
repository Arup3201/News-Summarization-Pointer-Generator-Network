Investigators were dispatched to the family’s home in the 400 block of Martin Luther King Jr where they discovered Victoria’s lifeless body wrapped in a garbage bag.

According to sheriff's deputies, the little girl was killed on a bridge along Henderson County Road 1500 and then transported home about 5 miles away.

There is no official word yet on a motive, but according to Parsons' common-law husband of six years, Gary Wyatt, his wife has long been jealous of their 4-year-old daughter.

The heartbroken father told the station KLTV that on Monday, he and Stacie were supposed to enroll Victoria in a pre-kindergarten program together.

Foreshadowing: A family friend said Stacie threatened to kill Victoria just days before the tragedy

But the night before, Mr Wyatt informed his wife that he wanted a divorce, which may have sent her over the edge. 

When Gary Wyatt woke up Monday morning, Stacie and Victoria already have left. At the time, he assumed they had gone to the pre-school without him.

A short time later, the 25-year-old mother returned home, parked her car in the driveway and walked away.

Gary and family friend Randy Dyess chased her down and tried to talk to her, asking the woman about Victoria, but the 25-year-old only said: 'I wouldn't be in that car if I were you.'

When Mr Wyatt opened the trunk of his wife's white sedan, he discovered Victoria wrapped in plastic and not breathing.

‘Oh, God it was awful,’ Mr Wyatt tearfully recalled. ‘Foaming out of her mouth, her head was bashed in. My baby's dead, she killed my baby.’

The father attempted to perform CPR on the toddler, but it was too late.

Gary Wyatt told the Texas news station while it appeared his wife has been envious of their daughter since the day she was born, she has never been violent towards her.

However, Randy Dyess, the couple's friend, revealed that Stacie  allegedly made a threat against Victoria just a few days before the murder.
