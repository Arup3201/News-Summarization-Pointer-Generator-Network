It may not have the sweetest-sounding name - but apparently this Tawny frogmouth still has plenty to smile about.

The remarkable-looking bird was spotted perching on a branch in eastern Australia with a startled expression on its face resembling a comical beaming grin.

The colourful owl-like creature was captured on camera by Malcolm Catchlove, 52, who saw it while visiting relatives in Woodgate, Queensland, for new year celebrations.

The architectural drafter, from Brisbane, looked on in amazement as the animal stared back at him from a treetop while two fellow Tawny frogmouths got in a flap next to it.

He said: 'We were visiting my wife's family for the New Year at Woodgate, a small seaside village on the southern coast of Queensland.

'After arriving at Woodgate, I noticed an amazing golden shower tree, known as Cassia Fistula, and I really wanted to get a few shots of it.

'My brother-in-law's house has a huge front deck which normally is home to two frogmouths, but this year had increased by one - most likely an offspring of the pair.

Distinctive: Malcolm Catchlove, who took the photos, said he was struck by the bird's quizzical intense gaze

'The New Years' revelry on the deck the previous night must have been too much as they were not there the next day.

Native to: Mainland Australia and Tasmania.

Diet: Insects, worms, slugs and snails. Small mammals, reptiles, frogs and birds are also eaten.

Size: 34cm - 53cm. 

Song: A soft, deep and continuous low oom oom oom. Also makes a loud hissing noise when threatened.

Breeding: Usually between August and December. Males and females take it in turn to incubate eggs.

Behaviour: They are nocturnal and spend most of the daytime perched on branches while camouflaged. 

'I figured something could be done with the blazing sun so I went off to photograph the tree.

'As I approached it I noticed that the deck's residents had taken refuge in the Cassia - their other, more natural habitat.

'As frogmouths are nocturnal it is not uncommon to find them roosting during the day, trying their best to look like part of the tree.

'Being wary creatures they watched my every movement and so I was able to get good eye contact for just about every shot however they did not appear to be disturbed in any way.

'In this shot they appear to be smiling however the smile is them panting, trying to keep cool, although it would be nice to think they were pleased to see me.

'These three are fairly used to humans and I was able to get right under the tree to get some reasonable close up shots.

'These photos struck me because of the intense, patient almost quizzical stare I was getting from all three.'
