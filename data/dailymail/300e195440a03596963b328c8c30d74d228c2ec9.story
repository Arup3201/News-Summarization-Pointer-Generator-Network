Manchester United have unveiled their new kit for the 2014/15 season. England striker Wayne Rooney was at the centre of the photo, flanked by Old Trafford team-mates Robin van Persie and Shinji Kagawa.

The collarless shirt, designed by Nike, features white on the sleeves and a hint of black, and marks the first strip released during Louis van Gaal's tenure of the Old Trafford club.

The traditional white collar returns for the new campaign, while the words 'youth, courage and greatness' are embossed in the neck of the shirt.

Time to celebrate: Danny Welbeck wears the new United strip. Fans will be hoping it revives the club's fortunes

Rooney and
 Co will wear the shirt for the first time later this month when they 
take on LA Galaxy as part of their pre-season tour of America.

The home strip is the first to bear the Chevrolet logo and Old Trafford fans will be hoping that it brings the club better results than they experienced last term.

United finished seventh, 24 points adrift of Premier League champions Manchester City after a nightmare campaign which saw David Moyes, who replaced the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson, sacked less than 12 months into his six-year deal.

Earlier, former Holland midfielder Ronald de Boer hailed United's new boss Van Gaal as a genius.

Commenting on Van Gaal's decision to replace goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with Tim Krul ahead of Holland's successful penalty-shootout win over Costa Rica, De Boer said: 'It was a genius move. Van Gaal is the best coach I ever worked with. He is the best chance for a team to have success.

'Nobody really believed in this Holand team, but I said, "if one man can change this team, it is Louis van Gaal". It is the same for Manchester United.'

Speaking to talkSPORT, De Boer added: 'Sometimes you need a bit of luck, of course, like we have had in this tournament and it will be the same at Manchester United.

'In the long term you will have success with him, but do you have the patience? He could win the Premier League title, or maybe the Champions League, but it is not really realistic, of course.'

P.S

United's rivals Liverpool also launched one of their strips for the new season on Monday.

Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge led the Liverpool cast as the Anfield club released their third kit. It is worth noting that shamed striker Luis Suarez was nowhere to be seen.
