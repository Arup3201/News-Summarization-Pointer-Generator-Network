From Paul the psychic octopus to Big Head the  sea turtle, the bookies are no stranger to calling in animals to help with working out the odds.

Now one is hoping a pack of corgis will give betting on the royal birth a boost, while giving the public a clue to the sex and name of the new fourth-in-line.

The 'Barkingham Palace' Gold Cup saw 10 dogs face off in race across London's Bedford Square, with a pooch named Alexandra taking first place.

Winning ways: Corgi Alexandra took the title in the Barkingham Palace Gold Cup

Five of the runners taking part in the race were male and five female, with each chosen by bookmakers Ladbrokes because their names are among the most popular with punters betting on the new royal baby's name.

A dog called Alexandra, a name that is currently running third in the betting, took the honours followed by Camilla (100/1) and Victoria (10/1).

Among the boys, Spencer came first, despite boasting real-life odds of just 25/1, followed by James (8/1) and Boris (200/1).

'Alexandra romped to victory and it looks like Kate will soon be giving birth to a little girl next month,' said Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge, tongue firmly in cheek. 

Prediction: The race was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to predict the name and sex of the new royal baby

'Royal baby betting is booming and the arrival of a new heir to the throne is sure to see a record amount of wagers placed.'

Alexandra, who won with a time of 4.32 seconds, was then treated to a winner's ceremony that included a trophy and a rendition of the National Anthem. 

Although corgi Elizabeth rolled home last in the Barkingham Palace Gold Cup, the name is currently the odds-on favourite should the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a girl.

Other popular choices include Charlotte, the second-favourite at 6/1, and Diana which comes in at 12/1.

Should the new royal baby prove to be a boy, it is James that is the hot favourite followed by Arthur, Henry, Charles and Thomas.

While the majority of names put forward by punters are sensible, others have had a flutter on more outlandish names, according to Bridge.

'Elizabeth and James are currently the most popular girl and boy’s names,' she explains. 'But that hasn’t stopped punters from betting on outsiders, including Sapesan and Mercedes at 500/1 apiece.'

Less favoured names in the running include Ruprecht, Chardonnay, Kevin and Wayne, all at 500/1, and Ruth, Justin and Colin at 200/1.
