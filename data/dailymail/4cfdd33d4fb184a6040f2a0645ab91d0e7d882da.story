The 31-year-old super middleweight from Liverpool challenges Arthur Abraham in Germany on Saturday night.

‘Paul is an experienced fighter, he’s been around for a while,’ Gallagher said. 

‘As far as the big stage is concerned, he knows what is expected of him. You can see the belief and his chest come out.

‘Arthur Abraham is a great world champion at middleweight and super middleweight and he’s fought the best.

‘But I think it gave everyone a shock to see that Paul’s the bigger man in this fight.

‘Paul is in a really, really good place; he’s put in over 100 rounds of sparring and we've tried to tick all the boxes so all the little demons that might pop up on his shoulder, we’ve taken care of them.'
