The family of a pregnant Pakistani woman who was stoned to death in broad daylight because she married without permission are to be tried in an anti-terrorism court.

Farzana Parveen, 25, was attacked with bricks by 20 family members on the steps of Lahore court because she 'illegally' married Mohammad Iqbal - with police reportedly looking on doing nothing.

Today it emerged Farzana's family will be tried in an anti-terrorism in the city after Shahbaz Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab province, ordered the maximum punishments must be an option for all those accused of the honour killing.

Yesterday Farzana's husband made the shock confession that he had killed his first wife in order to marry her. He also revealed that Farzana's older sister Rehana was murdered by her family in a separate honour killing.

Torment: Mohammad Iqbal was on his way to court with his 25-year-old wife when they were attacked by a group of her relatives who objected to their marriage. During the assault she was hit on the head and died

25-year-old Farzana was on her way to 
court with her husband on Tuesday when they were attacked by a group of 
her relatives who objected to her marriage.

During the assault she was 
hit on the head with bricks from a nearby construction site and died.

The shocking case has focused attention on violence against women in Pakistan as well as the country's legal system.

Sitting beside his late wife's grave in 
the small village of Chak today, Mr Iqbal said he hoped Farzana's killers 'die in pain' and vowed to fight for justice.

He also claimed that the same family members had previously poisoned Farzana's sister Rehana Parvana in a separate honour killing.

Nayab Haider Rizvi, spokesman for the Lahore police force, today said that four men had been arrested late last night in a village in the Nankana district in connection with Farzana's death.

Officers have already arrested the 
woman's father and say he has confessed to the killing. They are looking
 for two of her brothers.

Meanwhile in Lahore's High Court earlier in the day, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif ordered that those accused of Farzana's murder be tried in an anti-terrorism court.

He also issued instructions to the provincial police chief to ensure maximum 
punishment to all the accused involved in this tragic incident.

Authorities
 confirmed Mr Iqbal's own confession that he killed his first wife in 
2009 in order to marry Farzana. But the said the case had been dropped 
after the victim's family forgave him.

Under Pakistani law, those charged with a
 slaying can see their criminal case dropped if family members of the 
deceased forgive them or accept so-called "blood money" offerings over 
the crime.

Hundreds
 of women in conservative, Muslim-majority Pakistan are murdered each 
year in so-called 'honor killings' by their husbands or male relatives 
over alleged sexual transgressions seen as bringing shame to the family.

Activists say those who commit such crimes are often acquitted or given light sentences.

Earlier Mr Iqbal berated the police for refusing to save his late wife.

He said that police did nothing during the 15 minutes the violence lasted outside Lahore High Court.

'I
 begged them to help us but they said, this is not our duty... I took off my shirt [to show humility] and begged them 
to save her,' he said.

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has demanded to know why police apparently stood by, his spokesman said today.

Sharif
 had taken notice of the 'brutal killing' in the presence of police, his
 press office said in a statement, adding that a 'totally unacceptable' 
crime had to be dealt with promptly by law.

'I am 
directing the chief minister to take immediate action and a report must 
be submitted by this evening to my office,' it said, quoting Sharif.

Farzana Parveen, 25, who was three months pregnant, was killed by nearly 20 members of the woman's family, including her father and brothers in Lahore on Tuesday

Last
 night Farzana's body was buried in the presence of some 100 mourners from her
 husband's family at around 2 a.m. in a village graveyard in Pakistan's 
eastern Punjab province.

Mr Iqbal said his family had chosen to bury her at night because of the gruesome state of her remains.

Police initially said Farzana had been stoned, but said today that relatives had swung bricks, not thrown them. All the suspects, except the father, who has been detained, initially disappeared.

A police officer on Tuesday quoted the father as saying it had been an honour killing.

The 25-year-old had offended her family by marrying Iqbal instead of a cousin selected for her.

Muhammad
 Aurangzeb, Farzana's 20-year-old stepson, described how one relative 
had tried to shoot her, then grabbed her head scarf, causing her to fall
 over.

While a member of Iqbal's party wrestled the gun away, a female cousin grabbed a brick and hit Farzana with it, he said.

'She
 was screaming and crying 'don't kill me, we will give you money',' said
 Iqbal. He said he tried to save her but the mob of more than 20 beat 
him back.

At one point, six people were beating her with bricks as she screamed, he said, and he and his stepson begged police to help.

Finally she stopped screaming.Â

The attack happened near the gate of the heavily guarded court, the two men said, on one of the busiest roads in Lahore.

The
 couple had been due to testify there that morning that their marriage 
was genuine in response to a false charge of kidnapping brought by 
Farzana's family.

It was not the first time her family had tried to kill the woman, said her lawyer, Rai Ghulan Mustafa.

On May 12, seven of her relatives had tried to force their way into his office, where she was sitting,

he said, but his colleagues had fought them off.

Later
 they attacked her near a police station.

Officers intervened and held 
the attackers for an hour before releasing them without charge, he said.

'She was afraid of being killed,' Mustafa said.

The case is the latest honour killing in Pakistan to outrage the world.

'I
 do not even wish to use the phrase honour killing,' said U.N. High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay in a statement in Geneva.

Pakistan's Prime Minister demanded 'immediate action' over the brutal murder

'There is not the faintest vestige of honour in killing a woman in this way.'

But for two days, the attack met with silence from Pakistani officials.

Most
 national media outlets gave little attention to the story. Honour 
killings are so common they usually only rate a paragraph or two.

Women have been mutilated and killed for wearing jeans, looking out of windows, singing or giving birth to girls.

The
 Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said there were 869 such attacks 
reported in the media last year - several a day. But the true figure is 
probably much higher since many cases are never reported.

A
 small editorial in the national daily the Express Tribune denounced the
 killing and noted a case in New York where a 75-year-old Pakistani 
immigrant beat his wife to death this month for serving him a vegetarian
 meal.

'The
 great tragedy for the nation, alongside the murder of yet another 
Pakistani woman, is that the man's lawyer claimed the man acted on his 
cultural upbringing where beating women is customary,' the writer said.

Baroness
 Sayeeda Warsi, a senior minister of state in the British government and
 of Pakistani origin, said she was appalled by the killing.

'Perpetrators must be brought to justice,' she said in a tweet.
