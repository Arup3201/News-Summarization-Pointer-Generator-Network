The Florida woman who was freed from prison in a plea deal after being sentenced to 20 years behind bars says she's relieved to be out of prison, and is making plans for the future. 

Thirty-four-year-old Marissa Alexander was released from prison Jan. 27 after pleading guilty to three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for the 2010 shooting.

Now that she is out of prison, home on house arrest, the mother-of-three says she plans to return to school and work as a paralegal to support her children.

Alexander begins classes at the University of North Florida this spring, The Florida Times-Union reports. She aims to restore the stability that was lost in the lives of her children while she was locked up. 

Alexander has a four-year-old daughter and 14-year-old twins.  

Alexander expected to spend the next 20 years in prison when she was sentenced in 2012 after being convicted of three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for firing a gun at her estranged husband and his two sons in August 2010. 

But an overturning of her conviction led to the plea deal that landed the woman  a three-year sentence -- a sentence she had already served two years and 10 months of -- along with two years of house arrest.

'It was incredibly difficult to take that plea,' Alexander told Times-Union. 'But I thought about my kids; it was mainly the children that made me decide to do it.'

Alexander held that she acted in self defense when she fired a 'warning shot' in the direction of her estranged husband, Rico Gray, and his two sons, the Times-Union reports.

Her account is that Gray beat her after they had an argument and she tried to run away, only to realize she left the keys to her car in the house. She went to retrieve them and took her gun from her glove compartment with her for protection. 

She said she fired a warning shot at Gray to scare him away after he charged at her and threatened her, according to the Times-Union.

Alexander's case drew criticism and gained national attention after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in 2013. 

Her case became a key point in the debates over the Stand Your Ground and 10-20-Life laws.

The woman's Stand Your Ground claim was rejected because she left her home and returned with the gun.  

The judge, in 2012, held that, though no one was hurt in the incident, he had no choice but to sentence Alexander to 20 years in prison because he was bound by state law to do so. 

Alexander was given a new trial after a state appeals court determined that the judge made a mistake during jury instructions.

Alexander had faced 60 years if convicted at trial because of Florida's minimum-mandatory-sentencing law pertaining to firearm use.

With just two years of house arrest standing between her and complete freedom, Alexander tells the Times-Union that she is not ready to become a public figure, but wants to help those caught in the justice system to turn their lives around.

Alexander has a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Phoenix, according to the Times-Union, but became passionate about 'legal stuff' while in prison. 

She says she has found her purpose and is focused on what lies ahead.
