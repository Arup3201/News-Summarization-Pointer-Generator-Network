A Hawaii fish collector who tore a scuba regulator out of the mouth of an anti-aquarium activist won't have to spend time in jail if he stays out of trouble under a plea agreement reached with prosecutors.

Jay Lovell pleaded no contest to second-degree terroristic threatening on Tuesday, West Hawaii Today reports.

He received a six-month deferred sentence and must also obtain an anger-management assessment as part of the agreement reached between prosecutors and Lovell's defense attorney.

Sentence: Lovell received a six-month deferred sentence and must also obtain an anger-management assessment as a result of the May 2014 incident 

Lovell won't have to serve the time, and the incident may be removed from his record if he stays out of trouble for one year.

Rene Umberger and five other divers were filming Lovell harvesting fish in about 50 feet of water off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island when Lovell ripped the regulator out of Umberger's mouth.

Umberger and her fellow divers filmed as Lovell collected fish for the aquarium trade, which is legal, but unpopular with conservationists.

Umberger took the stand briefly to ask that Lovell's fishing license be suspended during the deferment period. 

But 3rd Circuit Court Chief Judge Ronald Ibarra told her the court must abide by the terms of the plea agreement.

'That act of ripping out my air supply was terrifying and dangerous, and if it had occurred to someone who did not have as much experience as I did, they might well have died,' said Umberger, a coral reef consultant for Humane Society International.

Just days after the incident, Umberger told Hawaii News Now, that she wanted her attacker arrested and charged with attempted murder.

'Attempted murder would be very difficult (to prove) because we would have to show that he attempted to kill her and we didn't feel we had that in this case,' a prosecutor said, according to Yahoo News. 

The prosecutor also noted that Lovell did not hold on to the breathing apparatus and Umberger was able to quickly retrieve it.  

Umberger has said she and fellow divers approached Lovell with cameras to document him collecting tropical fish on the reef.

A video of the May 2014 incident shows a collector quickly swimming about 30 to 40 feet toward a diver who is filming them and ripping out her air-supply regulator.

A snorkeler watching from above filmed the scene with another camera.

Lovell's attorney said last year that Lovell felt threatened when confronted by the group of divers and acted in self defense, the Huffington Post reports.

Lovell spoke very little during Tuesday's court proceedings. 

Instead, his brother James Lovell and his lawyer Marcus Landsberg attempted to cast Lovell in a positive light, noting the man's past selfless acts while claiming he did not go looking for trouble the day of the incident, according to WHT. 

In an interview after the proceedings, Lovell told the WHT that the divers came looking for him that day.

'I didn’t go looking for it,' Lovell said. 'It does look like we’re going to get protection from this and the next time they’ll be the ones who get arrested.'

Lovell also said that he needs to focus on his wife's health issues.

'That’s way more important than fighting with these people over fish,' he said.

No Remorse: In a post to her Facebook page, Umberger wrote that Lovell showed no remorse for his actions 

Just months after the incident, Lovell's brother told WHT that Umberger made statements at a meeting a year earlier that she would 'sic' Sea Shepherd -- a non-profit conservationist organization that uses direct action tactics to protect marine life -- on tropical fish collectors.

It was revealed that Umberger was on a Sea Shepherd boat the day of the incident.

Lovell's brother said in an email to WHT last year that the boat diverted its course and came within 100 feet of Lovell and his fellow fishermen.

Once the fishermen were identified, Umberger and other divers followed the fishermen into the water and began disrupting their work.
