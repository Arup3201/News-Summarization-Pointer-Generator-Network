Aviation enthusiasts could get their hands on a real fighter jet when two former RAF planes are sold at public auction.

A 1976 Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR3 Jump Jet and a 1988 Panavia Tornado F3 will be going under the hammer at Silverstone racetrack in Northamptonshire.

Silverstone Auctions said both jets, which are being sold as part of the Silverstone Classic Sale at the Silverstone racetrack, are going up for sale without a reserve price.

The Harrier, which served during the Cold War in Germany, the Falklands and in Belize, is described as being preserved 'in almost time capsule condition.'

The plane, last flown in in October 1990, was one of the RAF's close support and reconnaissance aircraft, which saw front-line service for over 15 years.

According to the lot listing, there is no corrosion, the paint and the markings are fresh and the mechanic components are in 'tip-top' condition.

The cockpit interior is also described as being good and even includes the original Mk9A Martin Baker ejection seat.

The aircraft first flew in 1976 and has been operated by all the RAF Harrier Squadrons.

Nick Whale, managing director at Silverstone Auctions, said: 'We’ve never offered anything like this before and it’s a privilege to be able to offer one of, it not the finest, Harrier in the world.

'The history and provenance of the plane, combined with the fact that the aircraft is so complete, means this really is an exciting opportunity.'

Also up for sale is the only privately-owned Tornado F3 in the world.

The Tornado F3, nicknamed the 'Guardian of the Skies', patrolled the United Kingdom and various other places around the world, where no fly zones were in place.

The F3 Tornado, built in 1988, has served with four RAF squadrons, visited Malaysia and Alaska on exercise and was last flown in 2003

Sold for display purposes, the jet for sale has 3,000 hours of active service, including use as the personal mount of the Commanding Officer of 56 Squadron and visits to Malaysia and Alaska on exercise.

It was built in 1988 and served with 29 Squadron, 5 Squadron, 56(R) Squadron and finally 111 Squadron and was last flown in 2003.

The lot listing describes the aircraft as externally complete with two Mk10A Martin Baker ejection seats with a canopy that opens with a hydraulic pump.

It is likely to be the only time a Tornado F3 is offered for auction as the fleet has either been sent to museums or scrapped, the auction house added.

The jets will go under the hammer this weekend.

Harrier GR3 Jump Jet

The Harrier Jump Jet was developed in the 1960s as a reconnaissance fighter aircraft and were ordered by the RAF in the late 1960s.

It is 46 feet in length with a wingspan of 25 feet and were fitted with a Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan jet engine

It can only carry a crew of one and could reach a top speed of 730 miles per hour.

Armament of the jet included two 30mm guns, four matra pocket rocket pads, five hard points and two missiles.

During the Cold War, the Royal Air Force deployed some squadron of Harriers to West Germany to defend against a potential strike of Western Europe by the Soviet Union.

They also saw service in the Falklands War but this first generation of Harrier did not see any further combat after.

The Tornado F3

The aircraft was the last Cold War interceptor with a top speed of 1,490 miles per hour.

It is 61 feet in length with a wingspan of 45 feet and were fitted with RB.199 Mk 104 engines.

It can carry a crew of two, a pilot and a navigator, was able to reach a maximum altitude of 65,000 feet and were fitted with foxhunter radar.

Armament of the jet includes one 27mm gun, 10 hard points, eight missiles and two drop tanks.

A total of 170 of the aircraft were ordered by the RAF but were replaced entirely by the Typhoon in March 2011.
