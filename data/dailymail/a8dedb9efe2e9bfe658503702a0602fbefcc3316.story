Former CFO of Amazon Joy Covey has died aged 50 after colliding with a van while riding her bicycle, authorities said yesterday.

Covey was integral in turning Amazon from a start-up to the billion dollar retail giant it is today after joining the company in 1996, when one of her main jobs was to persuade Wall Street investors to stick with the then-profitless company.

The mother-of-one was cycling on Skyline Boulevard in San Mateo at 1.30pm on Wednesday when she collided with a Mazda minivan which was making deliveries for OnTrac - a shipping service sometimes used by Amazon and other online retailers, authorities said.

'It appears the driver was making deliveries, but we’re still working on our investigation,' California Highway Patrol Officer Art Montiel said.

'[Joy] was wearing a helmet, but the injuries were too severe and she was pronounced dead at the scene.'

OnTrac, which is based in Phoenix, said 
the van was driven by a 22-year-old 'contract driver'.

Neither drugs or 
alcohol were believed to be a factor and it is not known if he was delivering for Amazon at the time.

According to her Bloomberg executive profile, Covey was Amazon.com's chief financial officer and vice president of finance and administration from 1996 to 1999, overseeing the online retailer in its first years after it filed for an initial public offering.

Jeff Bezos said of Covey to the Wall Street Journal in 1999: 'Except on an occasional basis when it is critical for me to deal with 
Wall Street, she makes it possible for me to spend a lot more of my time
on the customer experience.

'But her 
job is not only in the CFO capacity, but somewhat broader and deeper in 
communicating our message to investors, which is so important to our 
future.'

Amazon went public on May 14, 1997, with an initial public offering price of $18. Shares closed on Wednesday at a record $312.06, according to Bloomberg.

Mary Osako, an Amazon spokeswoman, told the New York Times: 'It’s a very sad day at Amazon. Joy was a wonderful human being and 
treasured colleague, and we will miss her very much.'

During her time there, she was named one of Fortune magazine's 50 Most Powerful Business Women in America, when they said: 'As CFO, her feat was convincing Wall Street that a profitless company was worth $22 billion.'

She took a salary of less than $100,000 in favor of stock options that, as of 1999, gave her a net worth exceeding $200 million, according to Forbes magazine.

Covey retired in 2000 to spend more time with her family and joined the Jetblue Airways' Board of Directors in 2003.

She entered California State at Fresno 
at age 17, graduated in two years and then took the exam to become a 
certified public accountant at age 19.

More recently she was a trustee at the New York-based Natural Resources 
Defense Council, according to Bloomberg, which called her 'an active environmentalist' who 'loves adventure, travel and outdoors activities, including kite 
surfing, skiing the steeps, and cycling'.

She leaves behind her son Tyler.
