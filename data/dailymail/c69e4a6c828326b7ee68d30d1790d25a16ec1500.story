A rising star of the Maryland business world has upset one of his most prominent local supporters after he sent his identical twin brother to stand in for him at an important photo shoot.

Mike Brenner, co-founder and CEO of start-up Betamore, was selected as one to watch in the Baltimore Business Journal’s annual 40 Under 40 feature.

Apparently too busy to attend in person, 29-year-old Brenner decided to send his brother Dan instead.

Perhaps BBJ editor-in-chief Joanna Sullivan should have been wary of selecting Brenner after he described himself in a Q&A accompanying the feature as an ‘identical twin who still enjoys the occasional prank.’

An irate Sullivan didn’t get wind of Brenner’s prank until it was too late and the list had been published, along with the wrong photo.

She was so incensed at having the wool pulled over her eyes that she then ran a story exposing the scam and explaining how she had called Mike Brenner to express her outrage and ask him not to attend the magazine’s 40 Under 40 bash next month, although she said his brother Dan could come along.

‘I’m just a stick-in-the-mud newspaper editor who still worries about our readers getting the correct information. The BBJ’s credibility is everything. When we make a mistake, we correct it. And in this case, a mere correction wasn’t enough,’ wrote Sullivan.

Following an angry call from Sullivan, Brenner sent her an apology for offending the BBJ, its readers and other 40 Under 40 awardees.

‘It was intended to be in good fun and to be harmless but after talking with one of the editors, I clearly upset the publication. For the BBJ and their staff, their readers, and the other award recipients that have felt offended or deceived, I do apologize,’ wrote Brenner on his Facebook page.

He also encouraged his friends to leave comments on the original article to try and get his invite reinstated.

To date the article has received more than 170 comments almost overwhelmingly in support of Brenner. No word yet from Sullivan on whether she is prepared to change her stance.
