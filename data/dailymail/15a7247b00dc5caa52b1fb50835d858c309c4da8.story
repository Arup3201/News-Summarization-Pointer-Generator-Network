More than 270 government staff are employed on zero-hours contracts, despite Nick Clegg warning they cause ‘worrying levels of insecurity’ for workers.

Five ministries admitted having employees working in departments and agencies on contracts that give them no guarantee of a regular income.

It leaves the coalition at risks of being accused of encouraging the use of the controversial deals, which are also in use at Buckingham Palace, the National Trust and several big name high street chains.

Uncertainty: More than 270 staff in Whitehall and quangos are on contracts which do not guarantee any work

According to latest figures released in Parliament, there are 278 people employed by departments and quangos on zero-hours contracts.

It includes 172 at the Ministry of Justice, five at the Foreign Office and two at the Department for Communities and Local Government.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs admitted that its agencies have 48 people on the contracts and the Department of Health said its quangos employed 51 without guaranteeing them any work.

The revelation is embarrassing for Mr Clegg, who this week warned families needed to know what hours they will be working in order to plan their bill payments.

Criticism: Deputy PM Nick Clegg said he was concerned that the use of zero-hours deals meant families could not plan their income

The Deputy PM said the government was reviewing the use of zero-hours contracts and a decision on whether to limit them could be made this autumn.

He said: ‘I am a huge advocate of flexibility in the British labour market, it’s one of the reasons we have not suffered the spikes in adult unemployment that we have seen in other countries.

‘But there has to be a balance. There can be a really worrying level of insecurity if you are employed on zero-hours contracts.

‘People with families have got to pay bills. We have all got to plan about what income we have and what we have got to pay out.’

He said Vince Cable’s business 
department was reviewing the use of the contracts this summer ‘to see if
we need to make any adjustments’ to employment law.

This week it emerged Buckingham Palace had around 350 part-time workers on zero-hours contracts.

They
were drafted in to cover the opening of the Queen's London home this 
summer but denied usual rights like holiday and are not certain of a 
single hour's employment.

Zero-hours
contracts do not set a minimum number of hours that have to be worked, 
with staff on call all the time, not knowing whether they will have work
from one week or month to the next.

Unlike
the self-employed who can work for who the like, workers on zero-hours 
contracts must ask for permission from their bosses if they want to earn
cash elsewhere.

And although workers are able to turn down work, many fear that doing so means they will not be asked again in the future.

Popular: People queue every year to enter Buckingham Palace for its annual Summer Opening, but it emerged this week that temporary staff are on controversial zero-hours contracts

Temporary staff working in the 
Buckingham Palace shop, meeting and greeting visitors and monitoring 
some of the Palace's grandest rooms are on deals like this to keep down 
costs.

Royal officials have denied these are zero-hours contracts because they rota staff a month in advance, not at the last minute.

It
has previously emerged that employees at other national institutions – 
including 3,700 staff at the National Trust – are also on the deals, 
meaning that workers at many of Britain’s grandest stately homes are not
guaranteed a single hour’s paid employment.

It
has also been alleged that cinema giant Cineworld's part-time workers 
and catering staff at the Tate galleries in London, Liverpool and in St 
Ives, Cornwall, are similarly treated.

Some 20,000 staff at Sports Direct, which is controlled by billionaire founder Mike Ashley, are also on the same contracts.

Uncertainty: Some 90 per cent of workers at 396 stores are now on zero-hour contracts with the company

More than 90 per cent of the company’s UK shop workers are on part-time contracts that do not guarantee them a single hour’s paid employment.

Employment lawyers warn the contracts make it difficult to manage family and childcare commitments, and present problems when budgeting to pay household bills or getting a mortgage.

Yesterday the Office for National Statistics revealed 250,000 were employed on zero-hours contracts last year, 50,000 more than previously thought.

A recent report by the Resolution Foundation into zero-hour contracts concluded: ‘The benefits these contracts provide for employers come at too high a price for the majority of those employed on them.’

On its website, the Citizens Advice Bureau says: ‘The problem with zero [hour] contracts is that you are only paid for the time you work, so even if you have to wait on work premises or be at home waiting by the phone, you may not be paid for this waiting time.’
