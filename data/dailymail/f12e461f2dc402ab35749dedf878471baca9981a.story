West Ham United academy legend Tony Carr, the man who brought through the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole, will be replaced after 40 years of service at the club.

Carr, 63, has been working with young West Ham talents since 1973 but will now take up an ambassadorial role at the club.

Carr told West Ham's official website:
 'I'm really looking forward to the challenge an ambassadorial role will
 bring. It will be a slight change in direction for me, but it will 
allow me to continue to do all I can to assist with the development of 
the next generation of young players.

'I
 will be there as a sounding board if any area of the Club wants to call
 upon my experience and expertise.

'As I take a step back from the 
day-to-day running of the Academy, I wish Terry every success in his new
 role and I am sure the Academy of Football will continue to produce 
fine young players under his guidance.'

'It
 is important that we plan for the future and Tony's new role will 
ensure we see a smooth transition in what is a crucial role at the Club.

'West
 Ham United is famed the world over for producing excellent young 
players and, having spoken to Terry, he clearly understands how much we,
 like every other West Ham fan, enjoy seeing our homegrown youngsters 
break into the first team.'
