The BBC has gagged a string of female presenters and producers after forcing them out because of their age, one of its former stars has sensationally claimed.

Former Countryfile host Miriam O’Reilly said she has been ‘inundated’ by calls from women who said they had been subjected to misogyny at the BBC, but were stopped from speaking out.

She revealed details of anonymous statements from former employees, including one she said was a ‘household name’.

One of the women said female colleagues were routinely sidelined as they became older, were made to feel unwanted, and were nicknamed ‘battle-axe’ and ‘matron’. 

Another said her editor ignored her in favour of her younger, prettier female colleague while a third said she felt ‘crushed’ after being forced out of the corporation.

Miss O’Reilly, 57, said none of the women were able to speak out for themselves because they had been persuaded to sign redundancy agreements that included draconian gagging clauses.

The former presenter successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination in 2011 after she was dropped from Countryfile to help it attract a younger primetime audience.

She claimed she has since been ‘blacklisted’ from working at the corporation ever again.

Miss O’Reilly made her dramatic claims at a hearing of the House of Lords Communications Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the shortage of women in the media.

She read out seven statements to support her claim that the BBC fosters a ‘macho’ working environment. 

She said all of the women were aged over 50 and had worked in BBC news or current affairs.

The first, who worked for years in Panorama and Newsnight and who was in her late 50s when she left, wrote to her saying women at the BBC were ‘ignored as they get older, sidelined, offered broken promises, made to feel unwanted and invisible.’

She added: ‘The men continue to function as normal, permitted to be ugly, grisly, fat, old and peculiar. They can be naughty, childlike, outspoken, opinionated and rule-breaking, but not the women.’

Another added: ‘You know it’s over when the editor starts looking at the pretty young thing next to you, listening to her opinion and ignoring yours.’

Miss O’Reilly said a further woman, who was a household name, contacted her after her tribunal case to say she too had been forced out. 

But two weeks after accepting redundancy, a producer called the woman to ask for her invaluable contacts, saying: ‘We can’t do it without you’. 

Miss O’Reilly said: ‘That particular letter is heart-breaking. She was a very, very strong woman but she was broken down over time to the point where she wanted to go.’

Another, also aged over 50, told her: ‘In the end I decided to accept the redundancy. I simply ran out of the will to fight it.’

Miss O’Reilly claimed the redundancy packages included gagging clauses that have prevented any of the women speaking out about their mistreatment until now.

She added: ‘I’ve never signed one. I’ve refused to sign one, and that’s why I’m always speaking out.’

A spokesman said: ‘We don’t recognise the picture painted at the Select Committee. 

'As we explained to the committee last week nearly half of the BBC’s news and current affairs workforce is female with 37.3 per cent in leadership positions in network news and 35.1 per cent in global news, and we have a large number of on-air and management positions filled by women in news.’
