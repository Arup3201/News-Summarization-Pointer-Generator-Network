We may all have been cooing at David Beckham's touching outing with his  three-year-old daughter Harper on her scooter this week, but according to a new study, this fatherly behaviour is nothing new.

The study contests the widely-held view that there's been a generational shift in attitudes to fatherhood and only today's 'New Man'is more comfortable with his parenting role.

Academics from the universities of Manchester and Leeds examined fatherhood in Britain during the 19th and 20th centuries and found strong evidence that dads were far more involved in their children's lives than previously thought.

New research shows that humour played a big part in Victorian dads' relationships with their children

The study examined Victorian working class fathers and 20th century dads from the First World War to the start of the Sixties.

Dr Julie-Marie Strange, of the University of Manchester, said she was able to disprove the negative stereotypes closely linked with the Victorian working class father as being absent, tyrannical, distant, drunk, violent and resentful of his children.

She found that dads of that era were  affectionate with their children, very involved and injected laughter and fun into the home.

'The term "Victorian father" has become shorthand for a man that is strict, distant and unaffectionate with his children,' she said. 

'And yet fathers are often neglected in histories of family life in Britain. Fathers were more involved with their children in the past than we recognised.

'This shows how firmly the stereotype is imprinted in our culture. But I found little evidence of this austere, absent man in my research.'

Drawing on music hall songs, visual culture and fiction, she discovered how comedy played a crucial in helping dads bond with their children.

'Comedy could be a kind of masculine 'baby talk' too,' she added.

Dr Laura King, from the University of Leeds who studied 20th Century fathers, said the history of fatherhood is used to support debates about the state of fatherhood today and the need for change in the future.

She said: 'The generalisation that fathers in the past were distant figures - as well as the idea that men have suddenly become much more involved in fatherhood in the last ten or 20 years - don't really match up.'

She argues that because they worked a lot, fathers were seen as uninvolved.

Kisses and cuddles with their children were also less common so the relationship was seen as less affectionate.

She said: 'Lots of men talked about how they worked hard and long hours specifically to give their family what they didn't have as children, and the love and affection between parents and children were simply taken for granted rather than constantly displayed.' 

She also noted how the birth of modern celebrity dad in the 1940s and 1950s - with newspapers regularly featuring stories about famous fathers such as actors Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster and singer Lonnie Donegan, as well as footballers and other sports stars - gave a 'new understanding of fatherhood'.
