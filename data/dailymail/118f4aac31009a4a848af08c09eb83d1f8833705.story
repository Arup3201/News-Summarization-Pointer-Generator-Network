If you want to get your partner in the mood on Valentine's Day, a new menu could provide the answer.

A new six-course meal featuring oysters, salmon, asparagus, caviar and chocolate has been created by the head chef at a top London restaurant.

Georgi Yaneff, who works at Piccadilly's DSTRKT, created the feast using the top ten aphrodisiac ingredients as voted by Britons.

The sexy supper includes ingredients such as (clockwise from bottom left) oysters, passion fruit, asparagus, pomegranate, walnuts, chocolate, avocado and quails eggs

The decadent £49 per head meal kicks off with a glass of Champagne, has 35-day-aged Scotch beef as a main and ends with a decadent chocolate and caviar dessert. 

From 10 to 14 February, diners are invited to sample the nation's favourite love-inducing ingredients featuring specially curated dishes put together for their aphrodisiac qualities.

This will include a champagne cocktail - the perfect start to a meal because the steady stream of bubbles will hit your blood stream quicker than a glass of wine.

The six-course menu was created with booking platform Bookatable and is available from 10 to 14 February 

The amuse bouche is a plate of oysters with yellow chilli sauce, containing amino acids which will affect the body's hormone levels and increase arousal.  

The next course is Valentine's guacamole with avocado, coriander, lime and walnuts. According to the menu, high levels of vitamin E in guacamole and avocado could help keep the spark alive because of its role in maintaining 'youthful vigour and energy levels'.

When the nerves start to kick in, lovers can tuck in to a salmon and passion fruit tartare, served with a quail's egg yolk, which is high in Vitamins B6 and B5 and will help balance hormone levels, and also fight off stress.

3. Oysters

4. Whipped cream

5. Asparagus

6. Avocados

7. Ice cream

8. Hot chillies

9. Salmon

10. Bananas

The main course is 35-day-aged Scotch beef tenderloin, with a Chianti and pomegranate reduction and served with asparagus. 

Pomegranate is filled with antioxidants which support blood flow. The aspartic acid found in asparagus helps to neutralise excess ammonia in our bodies, which can lead to fatigue and sexual disinterest.

Finishing off the meal is a sultry chocolate and caviar creation, stimulating the brain and encouraging it to produce the feel-good chemical, serotonin.

Ched Yaneff said: 'Having taken inspiration from the list of Britain's biggest food aphrodisiacs, I created a menu that really captures the essence of the relationship between cuisine and romance.

'Valentine's Day is traditionally about people coming together and celebrating their love, but good food often plays a big part in that. 

'Our aphrodisiac menu is a special celebration of this relationship and we will be offering this exclusive dining experience for the five days leading up to the 14th, so we hope to see many people coming along to try it.'

The ultimate aphrodisiac is available at DSTRKT from February 10 to 14 and can be booked via Bookatable.co.uk.
