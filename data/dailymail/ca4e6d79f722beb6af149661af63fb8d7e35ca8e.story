Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has said she believes it is okay for women to cry at work, to share emotions and be honest about their femininity.

Sandberg has gained international recognition following the publication of her best-selling book 'Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead' which talks about women's struggles in the male-dominated workplace and advises women to 'lean in' to reach their true potential.

Her forthright opinions have earned her both an army of admirers and a host of critics. She has been praised for articulating a new modern feminist vision and lambasted by others as an over-privileged multimillionaire out-of-touch with the average working woman.

Sheryl Sandberg COO of Facebook has said she believes it is okay for women to cry at work

In an interview with India's Mint on Saturday, the 43-year-old admitted that: 'I cry at work,' adding women are not 'one type of person Monday through Friday' and 'then a different person in the nights and weekend.'

'I think we are all of us emotional beings and it's okay for us to share that emotion at work,' said Facebook's number two, who has a personal fortune of $500 million.

In her book, Sandberg admits to having cried on Mark Zuckerberg’s shoulder at work and writes that 'sharing emotions build deeper relationships.'

But she also admitted that there has to be a cutoff point. ' I am not recommending that if anyone wants to get promoted, then go out and cry,'  said the executive, who was named in Time magazine's 2013 list as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

'What I am recommending is that as we think about being good colleagues, being good workers, being good employers, we ask people "how do you feel", not just how you think because so many of our decisions are based on how we feel,' she said.

Sandberg, who is married with two young children, said on the subject of her book 'the messages of believing in yourself and sitting at the table, getting compensated fairly, those can happen at any point in your career.'

The question of whether women can 'have it all' in terms of pursuing careers and raising families is 'very problematic', added Sandberg, who got $26.2 million in salary, bonus and shares last year from the US social networking giant.

Last month Sandberg stood up for another senior female tech executive when she delivered a withering response to the media's coverage of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's decision to order stay-at-home employees back to the office.

Labeling the reporting sexist, Sandberg was delivering a lecture at Stanford University to promote her book.

'It is really hard to know what is happening at Yahoo. There have been no public statements. But the scrutiny, the media firestorm, is about her being a woman. Full Stop,' said Sandberg.

Comparing a similar decision at 
electronic giant Best Buy to stop telecommuting, she said, 'When 
it's a man, no one pays attention.'

Sheryl Sandberg said last month that if a man had declared the end of working-from home at Yahoo instead of Marissa Mayer (right) it would have been a non-issue

In
 February, Mayer released a staff memo requesting that all remote 
employees report to office facilities by June 1, saying: 'Speed and 
quality are often sacrificed when we work from home... We need to be one
 Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together.'

Her
 employees' unhappiness appeared to be compounded by the fact that 
Mayer, 37, recently built a nursery adjoining her Silicon Valley office,
 so that she could spend more time with her son who was born in 
September.

Sandberg’s comments during her 
lecture were designed to support 'Lean In: Women, Work and the Will To 
Lead', which was published in March.

In
 the book, which falls between a memoir and career guidance for women, 
Sandberg says that women can succeed in the corporate sphere with a 
combination of good fortune, hard work and help from other people - but 
that they need to be more ambitious.

'I'm a pragmatist. I think, as a 
woman, you have to be more careful. You have to be more communal, you 
have to say yes to more things than men, you have to worry about things 
that men don't have to worry about,' said Sandberg, whose book quickly 
topped the New York Times Best Sellers List.

return to the office because she is a woman

'But once we get enough women into leadership, we can break stereotypes down. If you lead, you get to decide.'

Lean In draws from Sandberg's own anecdotes as she climbed the corporate ladder, first at Google and then Facebook, to become one of the most powerful women in the tech industry.

She writes about a moment when a group of all-male financiers were unable to tell her where the female toilet was because nobody had ever asked for it.

In the book she urges women not to 'lean back' when it comes to their lives, but to 'lean in' - give it 100% in all areas of their life - so they can 'have it all.'

Sandberg, who has two degrees from Harvard, has not helped herself with controversial speeches in which she has said: ‘The moment a woman starts thinking about having a child, she doesn’t raise her hand anymore.'

She worked at Google and consultants McKinsey before joining Facebook in 2008 where she has been credited with driving the growth of the business.

According to the company's SEC filing, she earned $31million in 2011, including stock options, making her one of the highest paid female executives in the U.S.
