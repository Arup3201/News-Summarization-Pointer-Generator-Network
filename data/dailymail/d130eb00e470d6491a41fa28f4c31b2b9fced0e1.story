Inter Milan, one of Italy and indeed Europe's most successful football teams, have celebrated their 107-year anniversary with a video montage, showcasing some of their finest moments.

Clips of great goals, trophy wins and panoramic shots of the club's famous San Siro stadium were featured in the 1 minute 35 second video, published on Inter's official Facebook page.  

Inter's bulging trophy cabinet includes: 18 Serie A titles, seven Italian Cups and three European Cups.

Inter's most successful spell in Serie A was between 2005 and 2010, when they won the league five years in succession. 

Recent seasons, however, have paled in comparison. Inter have not finished inside the league's top four since 2011. 

With the reappointment of Roberto Mancini though - the head coach who oversaw three of those five titles - in November last year, the club will be looking to return to the top as soon as possible.
