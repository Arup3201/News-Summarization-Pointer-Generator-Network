Luka Modric has revealed Roma legend Francesco Totti to be his footballing idol.

The duo crossed paths during Tuesday's International Champions Cup match between Real Madrid and the Italian side, which Roma won 1-0, and the Croatian took the opportunity to nab his much-craved shirt.

And he took to Instagram to post a picture of his new prized possession, with the caption: ''Most valuable shirt I exchanged with any players... My idol...'

Evergreen: Totti netted the only goal of the game as Roma beat Real Madrid 1-0

Childhood hero: Modric was just eight when Totti made his Roma debut

It was the evergreen Totti who scored the only goal of the game to end Real Madrid's cup defence.

The 37-year-old one-club man is about to begin his 23rd season at Roma, who are also set to return to the Champions League for the first time since 2010-11.

He made his debut for the club in 1993, when Modric himself was just eight years old.
