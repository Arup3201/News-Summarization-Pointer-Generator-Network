Outspoken: Emily Mortimer at the premiere of her new TV series The Newsroom

The star of highly anticipated TV series The Newsroom has called the American public  'dangerously uninformed'.

British actress Emily Mortimer, who plays a rebellious producer in the series about a cable news show, explained that she has always been interested in politics and flirted with anarchism when she was younger.

She told salon.com: 'I can remember when Bush got in for the second time, just feeling like so much of the problem about the way that politics go here is that people are improperly informed.'

She goes on to say that in the UK, the public has more access to foreign news and a better sense of what is going on in the rest of the world.

Mortimer said American news broadcasts were a 'pretty dicey area' before describing the Bush administration as 'terrifying'.

She added: 'You can’t rely on getting the facts, or getting them presented in a way that is actually objective and makes sense and puts people in a position where they can make informed decisions about who to vote for.' 

The 40-year-old actress, who has lived 
in the U.S. for a decade and holds dual citizenship, has appeared
 in films including Match Point, Shutter Island and Hugo.

The HBO series - about a TV anchor who has a public meltdown and suddenly 
finds his inspirational mojo - was expected to be a roaring success after being created by West Wing producer Aaron Sorkin 
and starring Jeff Daniels. However early reviews have been scathing. 

The Newsroom 'gets so bad so quickly that I found my jaw dropping,' wrote the New Yorker's Emily Nussbaum.

Mortimer plays Mackenzie MacHale, a veteran journalist with an idealistic streak determined to bring audiences the 'real' story. She teams up with news anchor and ex-boyfriend Will McAvoy, played by Jeff Daniels.

A review in Time Magazine noted: 'The show’s strongest woman is Emily 
Mortimer’s MacKenzie... but for every scene with her as Will’s peer, 
there’s another of her as a ninny–fumbling through a presentation, 
screwing up her e-mail, or abjectly apologizing to Will for a problem in
 their past relationship. In Sorkinworld, the men are men and the women 
are sorry.'

Mortimer, who was born in London, 
read Russian at Oxford University. She began acting in 1995 and has had 
starring roles including in films Leonie and Notting Hill. She also had a guest 
spot on Tina Fey's hit series 30 Rock.

She is married to American actor Alessandro Nivola whom she met in 2000 while they were in a film adaptation of Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost. They have two children Samuel John, eight, and two-year-old May Rose.

The Newsroom starts tonight at 10pm on HBO.
