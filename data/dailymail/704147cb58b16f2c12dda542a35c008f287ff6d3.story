A young woman facing a lifetime of obesity-related diabetes was inspired to lose more than 16st after her beloved father succumbed to the disease.

Lisa Charlesworth, 26, was devastated when her father John fell into a diabetic coma and died aged just 51 in May 2009.

At the time of her father’s death Lisa, from Blackpool, weighed around 27st after years of comfort eating.

Lisa had a gastric band fitted and dropped from 27st 9lb and size 32 (left) to 12st and size 14  (right)

She was warned that she too might develop diabetes unless she got her weight under control and, motivated by her late father’s wish that she improved her health, secured funding for a gastric bypass, which saw her shrink down to 10st 4lb.

She said: 'I was a daddy’s girl. He always wanted the best for me and before he died he told me that he wanted me to improve my lifestyle and be happy.

'Everyone except me could see that my health was failing. For some reason, the message never clicked. But to see my father die from diabetes was frightening.

'Suddenly I knew I didn’t want that to happen to me, and I knew he would be proud of me if I managed to make the changes I needed to.'

Miss Charlesworth, an office worker, first turned to large portions of starchy, stodgy food to comfort her when she was bullied at secondary school.

She said: 'I’m a natural redhead and being ginger made me stand out. Children can be very cruel. I was the one which other children targeted.

'The more I ate, the larger I became and soon the kids were calling me fat as well as ginger.

'By the time I got to college the bullying had stopped but I was already trapped in the cycle of associating food with emotional comfort.'

Weighing around 16st by the time she started college, she tried various diet plans and was even prescribed weight-loss tablets, but her weight continued to increase until, by the time her father became ill in the spring of 2009, she weight nearly 27st.

The weight began to fall off following gastric band surgery, and Lisa remains on a restricted diet

After her father passed away, Miss Charlesworth made a lasting decision to turn her life around for good.

She
 said: 'Dad was as thin as rake and had been like that since he was 
young. His diabetes was genetic, which meant I was at risk too. The fact
 that I was overweight meant I was at an even higher risk.

'Ever
 since I was small, I’d seen my father injecting himself with insulin 
every day. It’s not a nice thing to see. Focussing on the options for 
losing weight helped me through the grieving process.'

Miss Charlesworth was eventually approved for a gastric bypass on the NHS.

The day before the operation in November 2010 she weighed a dangerous 27st 9lb and was wearing size 32 clothing.

She said: 'I hadn’t been able to work because of my size and I was looking forward to making the switch, although I was very nervous about the operation and scared about the consequences.'

In the week following the operation, Miss Charlesworth dropped more than a stone. Within two years, she had shrunk down to 10st 4lb.

She said: 'My life completely changed. I was able to go back to work and found James, my boyfriend, who’s been amazingly supportive.'

Before undergoing the operation, Miss Charlesworth typically ate a bacon and sausage sandwich for breakfast, followed by a large chicken sandwich or a burger for lunch, and pasta with sauce with more bread for her evening meal.

Today, mindful of the restricted diet she must stick to following her gastric band, she eats a slice of toast in the morning, followed by a small barm cake with chicken for lunch and a portion-controlled plate of tandoori chicken and salad for evening meal.

Miss Charlesworth now weighs 12st and wears size 14 clothes. Together with her boyfriend James Martin, 26, a debt advisor, she makes regular visits to the gym and is careful to stay active.

She said: 'I’m the right weight for my height now and I feel amazing.

'Without my dad’s influence I wouldn’t have been able to get to where I am now. I know I couldn’t physically have done it without having the push I needed.

'I know dad would be very pleased for me. If I he was here now he would be amazed at the transformation I’ve been through.'
