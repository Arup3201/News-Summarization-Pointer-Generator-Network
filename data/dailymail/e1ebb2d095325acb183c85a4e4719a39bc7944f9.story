He's only been at the club for a matter of days, but already it seems Mario Balotelli has proved a hit among Liverpool supporters.

The 24-year-old made his Reds debut in their 3-0 win at Premier League rivals Tottenham on Sunday - as the travelling fans unleashed their new song paying homage to the club's new striker.

In the away end at White Hart Lane, Liverpool supporters could be heard chanting 'Mario fantastico, Mario magnifico, ole ole, ole ole' much to the delight of the Italy international who featured for 60 minutes.
