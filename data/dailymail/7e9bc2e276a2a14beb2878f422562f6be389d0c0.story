Thousands of BT staff are today set to cash in on shares worth £1.1 billion after a share scheme  paid out an average of nearly £42,000 each.

The telecoms giant said the five-year share ownership scheme, which began in 2009, was 'one of the UK's largest broad-based employee share plan maturities ever'.

Almost 23,000 staff who joined the plan saved between £5 and £225 every month until this month, meaning that they can now buy BT shares at 61p - a 14p discount to their level five years ago when the firm faced tough times.

When the FTSE 100 closed last night BT shares were worth 388.5p, an enormous payout that will in the main go to engineers and call centre workers.

Around 7,000 workers saved the maximum £225 a month, which means they are in line for a payout of £89,705 based on last night's prices.

BT adds that the scheme includes a number of BT couples who saved the maximum and are now looking at a £179,410 windfall.

The average worker saved £124 a month.

The BT workers in the scheme, who make up about one third of the telecom giant's UK staff, invested £177 million and are now in line for a payout worth £1.1 billion between them.

BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said: 'I'm delighted that so many BT people are sharing in the company's success through our saveshare plan.

'BT was facing tough times five years ago and this was reflected in the share price.'

Former chief executive Ian Livingston, who left the business last year, is credited with successfully reviving BT.

Thousands of BT staff have been celebrating huge pay outs today. But there are some customers who have been less than impressed with their service in the last year.

Here are five examples where the customer has suffered:

In September last year, a man claimed his 87-year-old mother Joan Bibby had been left stuck in her own home after BT workmen dug a four foot wide trench outside her property in Claughton, Merseyside.

The work took place on behalf of BT Openreach and without warning according to Mrs Bibby's son who said she had no way of getting out. However, BT said that she had been made aware of the works taking place and a ramp had been fitted outside the property.

BT Sport was forced to apologise earlier this month after cutting to an advert break while the Newcastle United manager and captain were laying wreaths on the seats of two fans who died in the MH17 disaster.

Producers only cut back to the Newcastle v Sydney FC match for half of the minute’s silence for John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28. A BT Sport spokesman later apologised for the incident and played the missing footage later and online.

In March, BT became the most complained about broadband provider for the first time according to figures from Ofcom.

The level of complaints the industry watchdog received about BT was 0.32 per 1,000 customers with most of them about loss of service or unhappiness with the way those complaints were handled.

BT faced a Twitter storm in June after customers complained that they were experiencing internet connection problems.

The company, which provides broadband to seven million UK subscribers, was forced to apologise and said it was unable to say how many customers had been affected.

In February BT was ordered to refund thousands of customers it overcharged in a directory enquiries rip-off. They were kept hanging on the line, unaware it was costing them £2.39 a minute with many of the victims elderly or vulnerable.

BT, which failed to make its charges clear to callers kept waiting on its 118 500 number, was also fined £225,000 by the premium rate number watchdog PhonepayPlus. It imposed the fine and ordered the refunds after a tribunal ruled BT's failures were 'very serious'.

When he became BT boss in June 2008, the former state-owned monopoly was burdened with huge debts and spiralling costs. 

He spearheaded a major turnaround, which involved slashing overheads and bringing its pension deficit under control.

More recently Mr Livingston oversaw the rolling out of super-fast fibre optic broadband and last year expanded into sport broadcasting with a deal to show live Premier League games.
