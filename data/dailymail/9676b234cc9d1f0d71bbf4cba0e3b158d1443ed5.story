The stepmother of a young boy who died and who lied about his whereabouts to police has been charged with his death.

Analize Osceola of Hollywood, Florida, called police on Thursday to say that Ahizya Osceola, 3, was missing despite the fact that hours earlier she had found the boy dead and stuffed his heavily bruised body into a trash bag that she then hid inside a Baby Einstein toy box which she put under piles of clothing in her laundry room.

She was charged on Wednesday with aggravated manslaughter, child neglect and providing false information to law enforcement.

This after an autopsy revealed signs of horrifying abuse.

The Sun-Sentinel reports that the boy's father, Nelson Osceola, who had been married to Analize for 10 months, was also charged with child neglect. 

An autopsy revealed the boy died of blunt impact abdominal trauma. 

In addition to the bruising all over the boy's body, the boy's pancreas was split in three pieces and the enzymes had begun to break down his internal organs.

There was also a spiral fracture on the boy's shin bone from an old break. 

'In his first three years of life, he endured what we believe to be a significant amount of pain,' said Hollywood Police Chief Frank Fernandez. 

'No child should ever, ever endure this life, the life of little Ahziya.'

Earlier this week, Child Protective Services documents obtained by NBC 6 state that Analize woke up at around 4am last Thursday and, according to her claims, she heard the young boy moaning.

She then went over and found he was very cold, but still warm, so she gave him CPR.

With his pulse weak, she then claims she went to get him some Pedialyte, then decided it was best to try and make him vomit.

The boy, she claims, died soon after, and she waited until the other adults were out of the house and then stuffed the boy's dead body in a trash bag and hid it in the laundry room.

Throughout this all, Analize's mother had been in the house, who is a nurse.

She never told her mother anything about what happened or asked her to help when the boy was in distress.

Police, suspicious of the woman, went to the house and found the body. 

Soon after she changed her story with police she checked herself into a mental hospital.

The father of Ahizya, Nelson (above), claims the boy was covered in bruises all over his body because he often fell

Analize's son Cameron, 5, from a previous relationship, and the couple's newborn, 8-month-old Candy, had both already been removed from their custody.
