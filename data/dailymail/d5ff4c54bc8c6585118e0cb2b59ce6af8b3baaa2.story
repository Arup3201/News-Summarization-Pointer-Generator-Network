Sacha Baron Cohen reportedly asked for a receipt for a £3.50 pint so he could claim it on expenses 

He may be a millionaire after having built a career as a successful comedian, writer and actor. 

But now it appears comedian Baron Cohen, best known for his roles as Ali G and Borat, could be watching his spending. 

While working on his latest film Grimsby he asked for a receipt for a pint, so he could claim it back on expenses.   

The comedian and writer has already offended Grimsby residents by painting it as a north Lincolnshire town largely populated by 20 stone women and 'tattooed fatties' in his latest film.

And when he visited local pub the Corporation Arms, the comedian reportedly asked for a receipt for his £3.50 pint so he could claim the money back while he did his research.

Nev Carrick, landlord at the pub, told the Sun: 'I told him we don't do receipts, but he needed one, so we had to write one on the back of a beer mat.'

Baron Cohen, who is expecting his third child with wife Isla Fisher, has received several Bafta awards for his work as well as a Golden Globe for best actor in Borat. As well as being a comedian he is also a successful screenwriter and actor, having recently appeared in Sweeney Todd and Les Miserables.

Throughout his career he has offended nations and religions. 

His portrayal of mankini-wearing Borat from Kazakhstan in 2006 upset the country. And in 2012 he appeared on the red carpet as a character from the Dictator, claiming to have spilled the ashes of leader Kim Jong-il - much to the displeasure of North Korea.

In 2008 he was banned from all Milan fashion weeks after he brought a show to an abrupt halt when he leapt on stage as his character Bruno.  

In his latest offering, a film titled Grimsby, Baron Cohen appears to be taking on the town. 

Locals have accused him of 'kicking us while we are down' after channel four documentary Skint focused on the poverty and high levels of unemployment in the area. 

He is known to have recruited six, 20-stone 'revolting' women to depict female footballer supporters from the coastal town. Football violence and hooliganism abounds throughout the film and Baron Cohen himself takes on the character of a dim witted supporter.

In photos taken for the film Baron Cohen is seen, dressed in a football shirt, flip flops and socks, walking through litter strewn streets full of boarded up shops. 

Actors are seen lying around the streets, fighting and drunk and women are seen as large and heavily tattooed. Rebel Wilson, known for her roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect, plays a character called Fat Amy in Grimsby. 

The film is scheduled for release this year but locals are unhappy about the depiction of their town and its residents.

Mr Carrick added: 'A lot of people in this town are unhappy about it, especially his fat, tattooed women characters. I don't know where he's seen them around here, but I certainly haven't.' 

Grimsby councillor Matthew Brown previously said he was 'disappointed' with the film and felt it painted the town in a bad light. 

There has also been criticism levelled at the comedian because a lot of the scenes were filmed in Tilbury in Essex.
