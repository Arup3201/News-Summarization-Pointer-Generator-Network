Competition for places on medicine degrees is now so fierce that high-achieving students should consider alternatives to becoming doctors, the Universities Minister said last night.

David Willetts claimed an unsustainable growth in the competition among students applying for medicine courses is ‘one of the most dysfunctional features’ of the school leaving system.

He said many students aiming for medicine drop physics in favour of taking maths, biology and chemistry at A-level – but this then rules them out of other scientific degrees such as engineering.

Becoming doctors: There has been a sharp increase over the past few years in the number of female applicants for medicine degree courses at UK universities - especially from top private schools (file picture)

His remarks come as new figures revealed about 1,800 of the 4,800 A-level students who failed to get into British universities with straight As were applying for medicine.

The problem was especially bad among girls, Mr Willetts added, with a sharp increase over the past few years in the number of female applicants - especially from top private schools.

He told the The Sunday Telegraph: ‘There are every summer several thousand very unhappy 18-year-olds, predominately but not exclusively female, who think they will become medics who, sadly, do not get a place despite being very smart and well-qualified.

‘And this is one of the most dysfunctional features of the English school leaving A-level system.

‘The truth is that the number of young 
people - and it does tend to me more girls than boys - with an 
aspiration to do medicine way exceeds any number of places that the NHS 
is likely to have.’

Warning: Universities Minister David Willetts claimed an unsustainable growth in the competition among students applying for medicine courses is 'one of the most dysfunctional features' of the school leaving system

With Britain’s medical schools 
receiving 11 applications for every place last year - up from nine in 2008 - Mr Willets said teachers must provide students with a 
secondary option.

He added that engineering departments 
at universities should give entrance to top students with no physics 
A-Level and allow them to sit catch-up courses.

However,
 private school headteachers claimed the NHS was at fault for failing to
 fund enough places on medical courses – despite complaints over a lack 
of trained doctors in Britain.

The
 heads at Oxford girls’ school Headington and boys’ school King Edward's
 in Birmingham both said that around a fifth of their would-be medics 
miss out on places every year.

There
 are strict quotas on the number of students allowed to take medicine 
and dentistry courses in the country because the funding comes in part 
from the NHS, reported the Sunday Telegraph.

Up: The number of applicants for medicine degrees in Britain has risen from 75,000 in 2006 to 84,000 in 2013

But, two years ago, it was predicted that there would be oversupply of doctors by 2025 – and officials decided that trainee places would have to be reduced by 2 per cent.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The NHS of the future needs the right workforce in place to make sure patients get the best care.

'Planning the number of medical students ensures that there is a close match between the number of places and junior doctors' training posts available.

‘It also ensures that money is not wasted training more doctors than needed who could end up going abroad to find work.’
