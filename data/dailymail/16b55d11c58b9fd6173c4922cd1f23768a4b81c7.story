St Ives has been named the most expensive seaside resort in Britain – with an average price tag of £123 per night – nearly double the cost of a break to Aberystwyth in Wales.

Tenby in Wales (£107) and Cowes in Isle of Wight (£94) came second and third in the top 20 list, compiled using the cheapest price of a double room in accommodation near a beach rating three stars or higher in August.
