Hundreds marched to the U.S. capitol Saturday in a  rally to support law enforcement at a time when tensions between the public and police nationwide are running high.

Demonstrators marched in the 'Sea of Blue' rally carrying signs that said 'Blue Lives Matter,' 'I support my man in blue,' 'Breathe Easy; Don't Break The Law,' and many others.

'I want our officers to know we care about them,' Kelly Wince, 52, one of the rally's organizers told the Washington Times. 'Our guys go out every single day and put their lives on the line. I don't know if my husband is coming home every night.'

Wince, one of the three organizers -- all married to local police officers --, said the rally is to unite the police and the community.

Andy Maybo, chairman of the National Memorial Committee of the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, spoke at the rally, calling it a 'blue family reunion.' 

He stressed that the rally, a 'peaceful demonstration,' is not about Ferguson, but about supporting law enforcement as a whole.

Other 'Sea of Blue' rallies have been held in Cleveland and Las Vegas.

Counter: The rallies were held to counter the months of anti-police protests, Other 'Sea of Blue' rallies have been held in Cleveland and Las Vegas

The rallies were held to counter the months of anti-police protests following a grand jury's decision not to indict a white officer who shot an unarmed black teen, the choke-hold death of an unarmed black man by a police officer, and most recently, the shooting of a black 12-year-old who had a toy gun.

Demonstrations across the country spanned months and some grew violent, Wince said the last straw for her was when a man ambushed and fatally shot two New York police officers, the Washington Post reports. 

Include: The rally included a moment of silence and opening ceremony at the National Law Enforcement Memorial, the march, and a benediction

Remember: At the rally, demonstrators remembered fallen officers and offered a salute and 'thank you' to officers still alive, risking their lives each day
