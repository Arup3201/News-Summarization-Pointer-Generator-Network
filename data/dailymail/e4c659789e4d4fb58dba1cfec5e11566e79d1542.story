A father-of-two whose hand was sliced in half by a machine has made a miraculous recovery, thanks to painstaking surgery.

Atushkumar Patel, 37, lost four fingers and part of his right hand when the machine he was cleaning turned itself on automatically.

Mr Patel, from east London, was rushed to Broomfield Hospital in Essex, where surgeons spent ten hours painstakingly wiring his bones, tendons and nerves back together. 

Incredibly, just five weeks after his horrific accident, Mr Patel has managed to regain the movement and feeling in his fingers.

Mak Tare, the consultant plastic surgeon at Broomfield Hospital who operated on Mr Patel said: 'From the accident to the procedure you have about six hours to get into surgery so it's high-pressured.

'I've never seen a case like this at the hospital but your training immediately kicks in and you know what to do.'

He added: 'Mr Patel is the sole breadwinner, has two young children and is right handed so we knew we had to do everything we could to save his hand.'

Mr Patel had been cleaning a machine when it started automatically, slicing off his hand.He said: 'The machine started, I don't know how, and my hand was caught. I instantly felt pain.'

The part of the machine that had started was one that carries things to another part of the equipment and drops them elsewhere - which is exactly what happened with Mr Patel's hand.

He said: 'I was very shocked, but the hospital and Mr Tare have been fantastic. I can't believe what they've managed to do.'

Mr Patel spent 20 days in hospital and underwent another six-hour operation to attach skin and blood vessels from his thigh onto his hand.

Mr Tare said: 'I'm delighted with how things have progressed so far and the team really has done a miraculous job.

'If you can only save one person's hand in your career then it's definitely worth it.

'Mr Patel underwent two big 
operations and is now undergoing physiotherapy, but we hope he'll be 
able to return to work very soon.

'Broomfield is a centre of excellence in this sort of surgery because of the infrastructure we have in place and the fact that we're able to mobilise our resources so quickly to deal with traumas like this.

'It was a remarkable case to work on and Mr Patel has become quite famous in the hospital.'

Karen Hibberd, associate practitioner, who was working on the night Mr Patel came in, added: "He was brilliant throughout, he didn't faint and was smiling all the time. It's been fantastic to be part of something so amazing.'
