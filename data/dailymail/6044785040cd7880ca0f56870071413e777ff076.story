Andy Reed, 26, was looking forward to spending the rest of his life with his new wife Claire until her tragic death at a friend's hen party

The heartbroken husband of a 22-year-old 'perfect bride' killed by a rare heart condition five months after their wedding has spoken of his grief.

Andy Reed, 26, was looking forward to spending the rest of his life with his new wife Claire until her tragic death at a friend's hen party.

Mrs Reed, an accountant, collapsed and died after getting out of a swimming pool and jacuzzi at the celebration at a country mansion.

Mrs Reed's best friend and paramedics desperately fought to resuscitate her, but she died in hospital from Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS).

Grief stricken Mr Reed, who only married the former head girl at a fairytale ceremony in October, is issuing an urgent plea to raise awareness of the condition.

An estimated 12 people under 35 die from a previously undiagnosed heart condition each week.

Mr Reed said: 'Since Claire died I have been hit by a tsunami of emotion.

'It is just so shocking that she has gone because there were no warning signs.

'She was so bubbly and full of life and so healthy that I can't believe it has happened.

'It makes it so much harder for me because we were only married for five months.

'Our
wedding day could not have been more perfect. It had been raining every
day up until the wedding day, and then the sun came out.

'Claire looked stunning when she came down the aisle, and I cried and cried. It was the best day of our lives.

'I am desperate for the Government and the NHS to make people more aware of what killed my perfect bride, and offer screening for it.'

Mrs Reed, who had recently set up her own beauty therapy business, regularly went to the gym and was a keen kickboxer.

But months after their honeymoon in Dubai and Mauritius, Mr Reed is in mourning and planning his wife's funeral.

She is reported to have 'felt sick' at the bash with 15 friends at the hen party in Taunton, Somerset.

Friends took her outside to get some fresh air and she collapsed.

Mrs Reed's grieving father Graham Hunter, 59, mother Anne, 59, and brother Pete, 26, are arranging for blood relatives to be screened for SADS.

The charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) runs 12,000 screening tests a year for a previously undiagnosed heart condition.

Of these, one in 300 young people tested are found to have a potentially life threatening condition.

Bolton Wanderers footballer Fabrice Muamba is among the survivors of the condition, also referred to as Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome.

Mr Hunter, a retired IT worker from Botley, Hants, said: 'We must not let Claire's death be in vain.

'This condition needs to be analysed and there needs to be more awareness.'

The couple, from Eastleigh, Hants, met nearly five years ago and Mr Reed proposed in Cannes during a European cruise.

Mourners at Mrs Reed's funeral, on Monday, have been asked to dress in her favourite colour, pink.

Sudden adult death syndrome (SADS) is caused by a 'ventricular arrhythmia', a disturbance in the heart's rhythm.

It can strike at any age and can even affect those who are fit and athletic.

Sometimes there are no warning signs, but in other cases victims can experience dizziness or fainting spells. It is often triggered by physical or emotional stress.

In some cases it may be caused by an underlying genetic disorder which runs in families, while in others it may be caused by a condition which is acquired. Around one in four cases is thought to be caused by a set of conditions called ion channelopathies.

These affect the electrical functioning of the heart without affecting its structure, meaning they can only be detected in life rather than after death.

The prevalence of SADS is not fully known as many sudden deaths are put down to accidents, but research suggests it claims around 500 lives a year in the UK.
