Roger Federer beat Andy Murray 6-3 7-5 in the Cincinnati Masters quarter-final to set up a final-four clash with Canadian Milos Raonic.

A turnaround in the second and decisive set saw  British No 1 Murray hit the self-destruct button, relinquishing a 4-1 lead over his Swiss counterpart to lose  7-5.

Murray could have little complaints, though, as Federer looked in superior form to the man six places adrift of him in the world rankings.

A touch of class: Roger Federer beat Andy Murray in straight sets to reach the Cincinnati Masters quarter-final

Tough going: Murray couldn't find an answer to Federer's tricks in the quarter-final and lost 6-3 7-5 in the end

Federer couldn't capitalise on six break points early on. The World No 3 did, however, pounce on the seventh, taking the fourth game to move into a 3-1 lead in the opening set.

It continued that same way as Federer took the first set 6-3. His first serve proved deadly, winning 83 per cent compared to Murray's mediocre 56. 

Murray had to improve and at first, he looked like he had. The 27-year-old cut a different figure in the second set, breaking his Swiss counterpart twice to establish a very health 4-1 lead.

That, though, didn't last long. Federer won four consecutive games to make it 5-4 and a frustrated Murray could only turn and mutter to himself in the aftermath.

The World No 9 looked defeated - mentally and physically - after letting his advantage slip.

Federer sat just two points away from winning the quarter-final clash, and an outrageously-good backhand from the seven-time Wimbledon champion sent Murray sprawling to move him one away.

Murray could find no answers to Federer, who sealed the win with another break in the final set.

Murray was left to ponder what might have been had he taken his numerous opportunities to break Federer's serve.

He told atpworldtour.com: 'I started the match off pretty slow tonight.

'[Federer] came out quick. Then I had a couple break points in back-to-back games to get into it in the first set. I didn't get either of them.

'Then obviously was well up in the second and blew it. It's a shame.'

Preparation: Murray will head to New York for the US Open at Flushing Meadows
