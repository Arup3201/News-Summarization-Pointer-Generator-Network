Avian flu experiments risk unleashing an accidental global pandemic putting the lives of millions across the world at risk, public health experts have today warned.

Scientists are taking part in controversial tests to create and manipulate strains of bird flu to try and understand how they evolve into more dangerous forms and pass between different species.

But public health experts at Havard and Yale universities in the U.S. have warned the experiments, which aim to track mutation in a bid to better protect against them, pose a risk to the public, if the strains are released accidentally or deliberately.

The report, published on Tuesday, saw experts argue that the dangers of conducting the Potential Pandemic Pathogens tests far outweigh the benefits.

Havard professor of epidemiology Marc Lipstitch and Yale professor Alison Galvani collaborated on the study Ethical Alternatives To Experiments with Novel Potential Pandemic Pathogens', that appeared in journal PLoS Medicine.

The pair have called for greater scrutiny of such experiments, urging countries across the world to consider an international agreement on the potential risks.

Lipstitch and Galvani's research state the 'dangers are not just hypothetical', citing the theory that the H1N1 influenza strain responsible for 'significant morbidity and mortality around the world from 1977 to 2009 is thought to have originated from a laboratory accident'.

The report adds: 'There is a quantifiable possibility that these novel pathogens could be accidentally or deliberately released.'

The study estimates that in the type of containment labs these experiments are carried out in, the number of laboratory-associated infections occur at a rate of two per 1,000 laboratory years in the U.S.

Lipstitch and Galvani say a moderate research programme involving 10 laboratories over a decade would run a 20 per cent risk of at least one instance when an infection is released, risking the threat of it spreading across the world.

The report said: 'The probability that a 
laboratory-acquired influenza infection would lead to extensive spread 
has been estimated to be at least 10 per cent.

'Simple branching process models 
suggest a probability of an outbreak arising from an accidental 
influenza infection in the range of 5 per cent to 60 per cent.'

The report comes after a U.S. biosecurity panel ruled in 2012 that two separate studies on mutant bird flu were too dangerous to publish, the Guardian reported.

The studies revealed new mutant strains that spread among ferrets - a proxy for humans.

The panel was concerned the recipe for the influenza strain could fall into the hands of bioterrorists.

The authors of the research - which was eventually published months later - Ron Fouchier at Erasmus medical centre in Rotterdam, and Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, criticised Tuesday's report.

They said their work had full ethical, safety and security approval, Ian Sample at the Guardian reports.

Kawaoka said: 'The authors imply that gain-of-function studies are going on without proper reviews.

'This is not so and suggests they do not understand how highly regulated this work is and the approvals and planning required to conduct this research.

'This commentary lists many experiments they think we should be doing. We are doing many of those experiments already.'
