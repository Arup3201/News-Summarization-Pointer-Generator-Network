If Norwich City stumble upon a little bit of good fortune this season, then God help the rest of the Championship. 

On Saturday evening, despite his team sitting top of the table, Neil Adams was still convinced and concerned that the footballing deities had deserted him.

'They say these things even themselves out over the season and we've had our share of bad luck,' Adams lamented. 

Norwich boss Neil Adams was frustrated with his side's 1-1 draw with Rotherham - his team have not won at home since mid-August 

Cameron Jerome scored Norwich's equaliser against Rotherham but missed good chances during the match

'You normally get one a season but we've had freak games back-to-back.'

The Norwich manager certainly could be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja vu. On Saturday, as in Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat by Charlton, his team had created enough chances against Rotherham to win four or five games but saw precious points slip through their fingers.

But they remain top after  rivals Ipswich did them a favour by holding Nottingham Forest to a draw on Sunday.

The Canaries fell behind to Rotherham courtesy of Paul Green's penalty having had the better of the match 

It certainly is freakish that the Canaries are flying so high having not won at home in the league since mid-August.

Not since Newcastle United returned to the top tier in one attempt in 2009-2010 has a side relegated from the Premier League started so well in the division below — but Adams was justified in thinking they should have more.

Norwich lost 1-0 at home against Charlton despite completely dominating the game from start to finish 

'It's an opportunity lost,' he continued. 'We've totally dominated and again I've got an opposition manager saying: 'I don't know how the hell we've got anything from that.''

Rotherham's Steve Evans had a point. This was an afternoon of yellow-shirted dominance.

Nathan Redmond rampaged down the right, Martin Olsson stormed down the left. Crosses whizzed in pretty much every minute. Cameron Jerome had four good opportunities before he finally made one count. Norwich crafted 27 openings in all but lacked ruthlessness.

Despite the two dropped points, the manner of the performance still showed that Norwich this season — in contrast to Fulham and Cardiff — are a textbook example of how to cope with life after the Premier League.

Adams believes that with players like Lewis Grabban (right), the team will start winning home matches

Having played 206 times for the club and taking charge of the academy, Adams was rightly given his chance at the top job. With some quality players retained and a revamped front line of Jerome (seven goals so far) and Lewis Grabban (six) they have hit the ground running.

Adams added: 'There's very little wrong with the performances. It just isn't going our way, particularly at home.'

The October internationals are a good time to take stock and Evans, too, can be content with how things are going. His Rotherham side were not without clear-cut chances and took the lead when Paul Green rolled home a penalty after John Ruddy had clattered Matt Derbyshire.

Norwich remained top of the championship after Nottingham Forest drew 2-2 with Ipswich on Sunday

After four successive promotion seasons — two with Crawley Town, two with the Millers — Evans is probably finding it a little frustrating to sit 17th, and he said as much afterwards.

'We're five or six points light of where we deserve to be,' he said. 'Those who watched us against Brentford and Watford (both 2-0 defeats) saw total domination in both games. And if you'd watched us at Ipswich (another 2-0 defeat), you'd think Rotherham were the established Championship team. We've embraced it.'

What's caught my eye 

Ian Holloway's comments when asked if Millwall were in crisis following their draw at Derby: 'Crisis is what is happening to people who go out to work for Christian Aid and lose their life.'

Plenty of incident in the Chesterfield vs Sheffield United derby, with Blades striker Michael Higdon and Spireites keeper Tommy Lee seeing red. Chesterfield won 3-2.

Colin Cooper resigned as Hartlepool United manager after a 3-0 home defeat to fellow strugglers Carlisle left them rock bottom of League Two.

Performance of the week  

Joy for Blackpool at long last on Friday as they beat Cardiff 1-0 to drag themselves off the foot of the Championship — a first win of the season. Could it be the start of a great escape?
