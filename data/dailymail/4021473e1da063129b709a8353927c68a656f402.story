Now that was a clash. 

Lateline host Emma Alberici fired up in an interview with an Islamic radical last night, accusing him of failing to answer a single question during a fierce 11 minute segment about the Islamic State terror group.

Ms Alberici blasted Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Wassim Doureihi for failing to answer her questions over whether he would condemn the group's murderous campaign.

'You are clearly obfuscating and I did not invite you on this program to do that,' Ms Alberici said.

Exasperated: Mr Doureihi faced fierce questioning from the ABC TV host. 

'You are clearly obfuscating and I did not invite you on this program to do that': At times, the host and Mr Doureihi talked over the top of each other during the heated 11-minute interview. 

Hands on the table: The animated discussion centred around the activities of the Islamic State.

She asked: 'Why will you not point blank condemn the actions of IS fighters?'

Mr Doureihi fired back by branding the question 'offensive'.

He said Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic political party which advocates for the establishment of a global caliphate, had previously made their position clear on the terror group.

'My clear position is that we took a clear position on ISIS long before Western politicians wanted to make - wanted to use ISIS as the latest bogeyman'.  

He insisted that ISIS and al-Qaeda do not exist in a vacuum, and condemned U.S. military action in Iraq. 

'They exist as a reaction to Western interference in the Islamic lands and they view themselves, rightfully or wrongfully, irrespective of my opinion or otherwise, as a resistance effort to what they regard as an unjust occupation,' he said. 

The fiery exchange did not end there.

Asked if he was outraged by Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf posting an image of his seven-year-old son dangling a decapitated head, Mr  Doureihi responded: 'Let me tell you what I am outraged by.'

A visibily frustrated Ms Alberici replied: 'So you won't even answer the question.'

Widely condemned: Earlier this year, convicted Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf posted this image of his son, then seven-years-old, posing with a decapitated head in the Syrian city of Raqqa. 

Ms Alberici expressed frustration with Mr Doureihi during the interview. 

Mr Doureihi said the U.S. invasion in Iraq had killed a 'million' Iraqi civillians.  

EMMA ALBERICI: Are you outraged by - are you outraged by the image of an Australian-born child of seven years old holding up severed heads like trophies in Iraq or Syria?'

WASSIM DOUREIHI: Let me tell you what I am outraged by.

EMMA ALBERICI: So you won't even answer that question.

WASSIM DOUREIHI: Are you going to allow me to answer - are you going to allow me to answer the question?

EMMA ALBERICI: What are the Australian public to make of this kind of ...

WASSIM DOUREIHI: If you wanted a one-way discussion ...

EMMA ALBERICI: No. I think you're the one who wanted the one-way discussion.

WASSIM DOUREIHI: If you wanted a one-way discussion, you would not - you did not - you did not necessarily have to invite me.

EMMA ALBERICI: I am asking you legitimate questions, ...

WASSIM DOUREIHI: You're asking the question, baiting for a particular response.

EMMA ALBERICI: ... which you have obviously come here knowing you didn't want to answer.

WASSIM DOUREIHI: No, you've come to push a particular view. Because you're not getting the answer you want ...

EMMA ALBERICI: No, I've come here to ask you answers so you can ...

WASSIM DOUREIHI: Because you're not getting the answer you want.

EMMA ALBERICI: I just want - in many cases I just want a yes or no.

WASSIM DOUREIHI: Let me make it very clear: you've invited me on to this platform to express my views.

EMMA ALBERICI: Yes!

WASSIM DOUREIHI: You're not allowing me to do that.

EMMA ALBERICI: But you want to express your views quite separate to the questions that I'm putting to you.

WASSIM DOUREIHI: I'm answering the question that I deem appropriate.

Mr Doureihi said that Ms Alberici was 'baiting' him for a particular response and wanted a 'one-way discussion'.

'It is not Muslims who are flying B-52s,' he argued. 'It is not Muslims who are dropping bombs from their fighter jets. It is not Muslims who are occupying foreign lands!'

Ms Alberici pointed out it was Islamic State fighters who were killing Muslims, Christians and children in the Middle East. 

She questioned why he would not call on young Muslim men not to join the Islamic State.

Mr Doureihi said: 'Just because you don't like the answer doesn't mean I'm not answering the question.' 

Following the interview, Ms Alberici tweeted that it had been an 'extraordinary' exchange. 

'I've never, in 20 years of broadcasting had someone not answer a single question,' she said. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, right, said he was changing the law to make it easier to ban organisations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir. 

War: Australian fighter jets launched their first airstrikes against the Islamic State on Wednesday. 

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who said earlier this week he was changing the law to make it easier to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, praised Ms Alberici this morning. 

'Good on her for having a go and I think she spoke for her country last night,' he told Fairfax Radio. 

On Wednesday, Mr Abbott told 2GB broadcaster Alan Jones the group made him 'angry and frustrated'. 

'We are changing to law that will make it easier to ban organisations like Hizb ut-Tahrir,' Mr Abbott said. 

'But before that even we should have a system in place which red cards these hate preachers and stops them coming to Australia.'

Another Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman, Uthman Badar, was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when he planned to give a talk at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas titled Honour Killings Are Morally Justified.

Mr Badar's speech was cancelled after a public outcry.
