Former Vice President Dick Cheney cautioned on Sunday that the next attack on the homeland will be 'far deadlier' than the last one.

'We're in a very dangerous period,' Cheney told the Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol in a video interview released on Sunday. 'I think it's more threatening than the period before 9/11.

'I think 9/11 will turn out to be not nearly as bad as the next mass casualty attack against the United States, which, if and when it comes, will be with something far deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters,' he continued.

If and when the U.S. is attacked again, it 'will be with something far deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters' former Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview released on Sunday

Cheney credited the increased odds of an attack to 'the dramatic spread of terrorist organizations' over the last several years and the 'proliferation' of areas where terrorists can find safe haven. 

All the U.S. had to worry about before 9/11 was Afghanistan, he said. Now the U.S. faces significant threats from terrorist cells in Mali, Nigeria, and all of North Africa up through the middle East to Indonesia.  

The former George W. Bush administration official acknowledged that 'some of the decisions' his boss made were controversial and still are now, six years later, the administration's methods were effective at 'preventing another mass casualty attack on the U.S.'

'I don't think we have any apologies to make,' Cheney said. 

'I think in a similar situation today, I would do exactly the same thing,' he stated.

Sorry I'm not sorry: Cheney told Weekly Standard founder Bill Kristol he has no regrets about the way he and George W. Bush's administration aggressively combated terrorist threats

Not citing the sitting president, Barack Obama, by name, Cheney suggested that his unwillingness to engage Middle Eastern countries militarily could prove detrimental to the U.S. and the international community.

'For us to look at that part of the world and think we can hide behind our ocean, everything's fine, that's crazy,' he said. 'You gotta be a fool to believe isolationist strategy is the way to go. 

'We have no choice to be involved in that part of the world, and if we're not actively involved, some very bad things are gonna happen,' he added.

Cheney also listed a nuclear Iran, cuts to the military and Chinese hackers as worrisome threats to the U.S.

'I think we're entering a period of considerable danger with the United States that relative to other nations is weaker than we oughta be,' he said.

'What we need is strong leadership. We need a president and a Congress who understand the nature of the threat. 

The retired politician expressed hope that the U.S. 'will rise to the occasion now as we did in the past' during World War I and World War II and warned that it's 'very important that we do so.'

'This is not the time for us to rest on our laurels' or cut defense budget he said, referring to Obama's reduction in the military's size and scope. 

Cheney did not indicate who he thought would make a good replacement for Obama once he leaves office in early 2017, but he said America needs 'somebody who will step up and remind the world what the United States is capable of and demonstrate the ability and willingness to do that.'
