Prince Charles took the Tube for the first time in nearly 27 years yesterday – and seemed to find it a little bewildering.

But if the journey was strange for him, it was hardly what a normal London Underground passenger experiences, either.

For a start, Charles and the Duchess of 
Cornwall arrived at Farringdon station in a chauffeur-driven silver 
Bentley.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall yesterday travelled on the Tube as part of the network's 150-year anniversary

Charles and Camilla qualify for a Freedom Pass but they were given Oyster cards with £10 loaded onto them anyway

After finally figuring out how to use his Oyster card, Prince Charles made his way through the barriers at Farringdon Station

Then their Metropolitan Line train ran on time, the carriage was (unusually) clean – and had been helpfully cleared of all other commuters.

And the smiling couple actually appeared to enjoy their jaunt, to mark 
the Tube’s 150th anniversary.

However, just one stop up the line, at 
King’s Cross, after a four minute journey they hopped off and got back in the Bentley.

Details of the visit had been kept 
secret until the last minute, but astonished commuters soon crowded 
around as the couple arrived at Farringdon, one of the original stations
built in 1863 and known as the 'birthplace of the tube', shortly after 
10am.

Although both qualify for the city's 
over-60s 'Freedom Pass', they were presented with limited edition 
commemorative Oyster travel cards by staff which had been topped up with
£10 credit for the £2.10 journey.

It was clearly a novel experience for 
the bemused 64-year-old prince, who had to be shown by an underground 
executive how to swipe his card through the electronic ticket barrier.

Camilla, an occasional Underground user in her pre-royal
days, breezed through in his wake.The cards are expected to be retained
by the Royal Collection and may be displayed in years to come.

Charles’s last experience of the Tube was in April 1986, when he and his late wife Diana opened Heathrow’s Terminal 4.

There were members of the public on the platform at Farringdon but they were kept away from the carriage that would carry Charles and Camilla

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were given a tour of the impressive Kings Cross station

Perhaps wanting to get away from all the watching eyes, Charles and Camilla tried to get to Harry Potter's platform 9 and three quarters at Kings Cross

After a briefing about the history of 
the underground and the new £15 billion Crossrail project that will pass
through Farringdon linking east and west London, the couple walked 
along the eastbound platform to catch their Metropolitan Line train.

Members of the public, however, were 
held back by police as the couple waited patiently for the 752 Wembley 
service to arrive, with Charles joking at waiting pressmen: 'Are you lot
coming too?'

The royal train was distinctly 
different to those normally in service during the morning commute, 
however. One of the new S-stock British-made Bombardier trains slowly 
being rolled out across the network, it was clean, spacious and had air 
conditioning.

The train was also very much empty, having been brought directly from sidings in nearby Moorgate.

And although members of the public 
waiting at the station were permitted to board, police officers kept 
them well away from the heir to the throne and his wife, who were 
sitting in the first carriage surrounded by senior London Underground 
and Transport for London staff.

Charles and Camilla travelled one stop from Farringdon to Kings Cross - a journey that usually takes a couple of minutes

Charles and Camilla enjoyed their trip on a brand new tube train

Camilla was invited to choose a seat 
(unlike sardine-like morning commuters who are lucky to get one at all) 
ushering her husband to join her. The pair laughed animatedly as they 
made themselves comfortable for their short journey to King's Cross.

Charles actually appeared disappointed when the trip ended. 'Just one stop?' he asked

'Here we are, darling,' Camilla said 
as the pair prepared to alight, walking past dozens of commuters reading
their morning papers. More than one looked up at the commotion and then
did a double take as the future king strode merrily by.

King's Cross has a family connection 
for Camilla as the original Victorian station was designed by her 
great-great-great uncle, Lewis Cubitt.

Staff appeared relieved that the 
journey had gone without a hitch. Greeting the prince and his party, 
Robin Gisby, Managing Director of Network Operations, asked: 'So you 
have delivered them safely?'

Although ostensibly at King's Cross to
view an ongoing £500 million program of restoration, the first stop was
just for fun: a visit to the station's Harry Potter attraction, 
Platform 9 ¾.

The royal couple also spoke with engineers about the Crossrail project

In the JK Rowling books, student 
wizards push their trolleys through a wall to get to the mythical 
platform on their way to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

And as part of their refurbishment, 
Network Rail have re-created the scene on a brick wall close to the 
existing Platform 9, which is already a major attraction for busloads of
fans eager to have their picture taken at the hallowed spot.

Despite being a Duchess, avid reader 
Camilla was no different and made a beeline for the attraction, posing 
happily for waiting photographers.

Her indulgent husband waited for a few moments before telling her: 'Come away, darling, you'll be there all day!'

Camilla did as she was told but was 
later delighted to be given a souvenir photograph of her visit, which 
members of the public can normally purchase for £8.

Walking towards the waiting Bentley, she told the Mail: 'My grandchildren will absolutely love this!'
