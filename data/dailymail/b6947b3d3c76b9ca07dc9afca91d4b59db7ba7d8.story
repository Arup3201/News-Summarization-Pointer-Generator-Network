Tattoos are traditionally used to decorate the skin, but now archaeologists believe skin etchings discovered on a 5,000-year-old mummy could have been intended as therapy.

The marks found on Ötzi the iceman reveal that tattoos could have been used as a primitive form of acupuncture.

The iceman's tattoos are largely seen on the parts of his body that endured wear-and-tear, causing archaeologists to liken the practice of tattooing to acupuncture, which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress.

Ötzi's body art is the only known example of real-life ancient tattoos and reveal how the marks were made in Copper Age Europe.

Writing in the publication Archaeology, U.S. experts Jarrett A. Lobell and Eric A. Powell said Ötzi's body, which was almost perfectly preserved in ice, provides unique evidence of early medicine for archaeologists.

They said Ötzi got his 50 tattoos - most of which are lines and crosses - by enduring a series of small incisions in his skin, which were then rubbed with charcoal to make the marks.

'Because they are all found on parts of 
the body that show evidence of a lifetime of wear and tear - the ankles, 
wrists, knees, Achilles tendon, and lower back, for example - it’s thought
 that Ötzi’s tattoos were therapeutic, not decorative or symbolic,' they added.

When the mummy was first studied, experts were shocked at Ötzi's tattooed skin as they had never seen real examples of Copper Age tattoos before.

They were also surprised as it is popularly thought that acupuncture was invented more than 2,000 years later in Asia and the mummy's markings look like they have been made over joints under stress such as the ankles and wrists.

They wrote: 'Of
 course we can't be absolutely sure why these tattoos were placed in 
those locations. It's possible Ötzi's people believed those regions of 
the body were spiritually significant. Still, it's very possible that 
this was an early effort at acupuncture.'

If this is the case, it would appear that the tattoos were not originally intended to be merely decorative or symbolic, but could have been used as a kind of medicine to treat ailments like rheumatism, and arthritis, which are also treated using acupuncture.

A spokesman for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, told Mail Online:' It seems common opinion that the Iceman tattoos are not ornamental but therapeutic tattoos for pain relief.

'Radiological images of the tattooed areas show degenerative areas under the tattoos that could have caused pain.

'As the tattooing spots lie approximately over the acupuncture medians, it seems common opinion that they could have been use for that.'

Professor Frank Rühli, head of the Centre for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich, told Mail Online the tattoos were probably a combination of decorative art and therapy.

Archaeologists believe that judging by the clothing, tools and weapons found with the mummy fozen in the Alps on the Austrian, Italian border two decades ago, Ötzi was a herder or a chieftain in Copper Age Europe

He said that while there might be a connection to suggest the tattoos functioned as a form of ancient acupuncture, it is difficult to see which ailments the mummy suffered from, so an indication of the marks being therapeutic is 'likely' but cannot be proven as there are not a number of similar bodies to study, found in the same location that are the same age.

The spokesman for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology said that if indeed the tattoos were created as a form of acupuncture, 'people of the Iceman's times would have known not only about nature around them, but also about the human body and its reactions - I think this is remarkable.'

While the reasons for creating the tattoos may not be agreed upon, archaeologists believe that judging by the clothing, tools and weapons found with the mummy frozen in the Alps on the Austrian, Italian border two decades ago, Ötzi was a herder or a chieftain in Copper Age Europe.

DNA analysis has revealed details of the iceman's life

The 5,300-year-old 'ice mummy' known 
as Ötzi suffered from the world's first-known case of Lyme disease, a 
bacterial parasite spread by ticks, according to new DNA analysis.

Ötzi,
 who was 46 at the time of his death and measured 5ft2, also had brown 
eyes, had relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant.

Ötzi was also predisposed to heart disease.

The
 new research focused on the DNA in the nuclei of Ötzi's cells, and 
could yield further insights into the famous 'ice mummy's life.

He was unearthed in September 1991 by a couple of German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named.

The iceman has been crucial to our understanding of how prehistoric people lived, what they wore and even what they ate.

Researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat.

Archaeologists
 believe Otzi, who was carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper 
axe, may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival
 tribe.

Researchers say he was about 159cm tall (5ft 2.5in), 46 years old, arthritic and infested with whipworm, an intestinal parasite.

His
 perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold 
storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a 
constant temperature of -6°C. Visitors can view the mummy through a 
small window.

Alongside
 his remains is a new Otzi model created using 3D images of the corpse 
and forensic technology by two Dutch artists – Alfons and Adrie Kennis.
