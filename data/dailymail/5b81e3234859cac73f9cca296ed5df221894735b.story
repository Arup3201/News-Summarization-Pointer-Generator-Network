Hundreds of millions are once again being spent in the transfer market this summer, but there is still no greater feeling of satisfaction for a club than to bring through a youngster and see them flourish in the first team.

It is a huge challenge for young stars with bags of potential to earn the chance to make the step up and go on to become a regular in the senior side.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the best young players in the country to watch out for who could be set to make that breakthrough this season.

Club: Chelsea Age: 19 Position: Central Midfielder

John Terry was raving about Baker after he set up all three goals in their 3-2 pre-season friendly win against Wycombe. The 19-year-old scored 17 goals for the Under 21 side last season. He is known for his deadly set piece delivery and can produce moments of magic from nowhere.

Club: Manchester City Age: 19 Position: Striker/Winger

The City forward has dad Andy to call on if he ever needs tips on scoring goals. Cole has worked his way through City's academy and Manuel Pellegrini called him up to the squad for their pre-season tour of South Africa last summer. The Chilean is known to be a fan.

Club: Manchester City Age: 19 Position: Centre back

His ability on the ball and reading of the game have drawn comparison to Vincent Kompany – and surely also the fact he is a Belgian centre half. Recently called up to the Belgian under 21 side.

Captain material? Jason Denayer has been compared to City first-team skipper Vincent Kompany

Club: Arsenal Age: 21 Position: Attacking Midfielder

It will be tough for the German to break through with the wealth of players in a similar position available to Arsene Wenger, but he is highly rated by the club. Eisfeld has played for the first team in the League Cup already.

In action: Thomas Eisfeld has already tasted life in Arsenal's first-team having played in the League Cup

Club: MK Dons Age: 18 Position: Defender/Midfielder

He is on the verge of a move to Everton after handing in a transfer request at MK Dons. The Zimbabwe-born player has been capped by England up to Under 19 level. Those who have watched him play regularly say he is in the mould of Rio Ferdinand. Was the youngest player ever to take to the field for MK Dons, aged just 15, when he came on as a substitute in 2011.

Club: Aston Villa Age: 18 Position: Winger/Attacking midfielder

The Republic of Ireland Under 21 midfielder has spent time on loan at Notts County and played a part in the Villa side who won the Next Gen Series last season. He made the bench of the senior Villa team aged just 16.

Club: Liverpool Age: 18 Position: Winger

Ibe has played a couple of first team games for Liverpool already but this looks like his season to really break through. The 5ft 7in flyer has looked the part in pre-season so far, setting up both goals in their 2-1 win against Preston. He's a fast, direct winger and it is understood Brendan Rodgers is a huge admirer.

Star in the making: Winger Jordon Ibe (right) has impressed in Liverpool's two pre-season friendlies to date

Club: Everton Age: 16 Position: Central midfielder

He was captain of the England Under 17 team who won the European Championship in May and even scored a penalty in the decisive final shootout against Holland. Considers himself to be similar to Frank Lampard in his playing style. Still very young, but that didn't stop Wayne Rooney or Ross Barkley getting a chance at Goodison Park.

Box-to-box starlet: Ryan Ledson captained England Under 17s to  European Championship glory in May

Club: Southampton Age: 19 Position: Winger

Joined Southampton's famed academy aged eight and has been with the club since. The predominantly left-sided player has featured once for the first team, in the FA Cup. Recently signed a new four-year deal.

Club: Tottenham Age: 17 Position: Attacking midfielder

Another who was part of the England Under 17 side to lift the European Championship trophy. New Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is known for bringing youth players into the first team, increasing his chances this season. Some at the club believe this could be his year.

Club: Liverpool Age: 19 Position: Winger/Striker

The Sweden under 21 star has scored in each of Liverpool's opening friendlies against Brondby and Preston. Those goals earned him a place in the squad for their pre-season tour of America, having previously not made the cut.

Things are looking up: Kristoffer Peterson has scored in both of Liverpool's pre-season fixtures so far

Club: Southampton Age: 19 Position: Midfielder

Reed has already been around Southampton's first team, making seven appearances for the seniors. With the departures of key players this summer he could become a more regular figure in the side this campaign.

Chance: Harrison Reed (left) could feature often for Southampton next season following the sale of key players

Club: Manchester City Age: 19 Position: Centre-back

Rekik, born in Holland but of Tunisian descent, has already been capped by the senior Dutchteam. He has only made one brief appearance for City's first team but his loan spell at PSV Eindhoven last season, where he made 25 league appearances, earned him a place in Louis van Gaal's provisional squad for the World Cup. He did not make the final cut.

Club: Fulham Age: 17 Position: Second Striker/Winger

Roberts can play on the right wing, but he is devastating through the middle. At 5ft 5in he is smaller than most of his peers but his low centre of gravity has seen him compared to Lionel Messi. Scored twice on the way to winning the Euros with the England Under 17s and has netted seven goals in 14 internationals for them. After Fulham's relegation it is expected he will get plenty more playing time for their senior team next season.

Club: Liverpool Age: 17 Position: Midfielder

Robbie Fowler has likened him to Steven Gerrard already, even though he is just 17. Rossiter has got a bit of filling out to do but passes the ball well and is fearless. Yet to play for Liverpool in a competitive fixture but this could be his season.

Club: Southampton Age: 18 Position: Left-back

Targett is being lined up as the long-term replacement for Luke Shaw following his move to Manchester United. Another who has been at Southampton's academy since he was eight. Some expect him to follow in the footsteps of the two most famous left-sided players to come through at the south coast club.

Club: Arsenal Age: 19 Position: Central Midfielder/Attacking Midfield

The Spaniard joined Arsenal from Barcelona in 2011 and quickly caught the eye by scoring five times in seven appearances for their Under 18 side. He was included in training with the senior squad last season.

Club: Manchester United Age: 18 Position: Striker

Announced himself on the scene with two goals in his first start for United in a 3-1 win against Hull, but that is his only appearance for the senior side. It was a surprise call-up by Ryan Giggs while he was in charge at the club – and he predicted Wilson would go on to become a new Old Trafford star.

Dream start: James Wilson (left) scored twice in his Manchester United debut against Hull last season

Club: Tottenham Age: 18 Position: Central midfielder

Made the bench for Tottenham's Europa League quarter-final against Benfica last season, so has had a taste of first-team action. Again, with Pochettino at the helm, expect more Spurs youngsters to be popping up in the senior squad.

Club: Arsenal Age: 17 Position: Central Midfield

A former coach said that 'he dribbles like Iniesta and he passes like Xavi.' Jack Wilshere has also hailed the player's ability. Zelalem made his first-team debut in the FA Cup as a 16-year-old, making him the first player born after Arsene Wenger joined Arsenal to play for the first-team.
