Failing eyesight: Dr Turner Waddell, 90, drove the wrong way along the A30 and crashed into Neil Colqhuhoun's car, killing him

A 90-year-old driver with failing eyesight, who caused a fatal car crash with another car while driving on the wrong side of the road, was given a nine month suspended sentence today.

Retired doctor Dr Turner Waddell took a wrong turn on the A30 between Hook and Basingstoke in Hampshire, and ended up travelling south on the northbound carriageway.

About a mile down the road, he 
smashed into Neil Colqhuhoun’s Vauxhall Vectra, killing him as his car 
collided with another vehicle and burst into flames.

The day before the accident, Waddell had
visited a doctor who reported that Waddell's eyesight was below the legal driving standard but did 
not tell him not to drive because he assumed Waddell was not driving, 
Winchester Crown Court heard.

Horrified drivers told police how they had flashed their lights and hit their horns in an attempt to warn Waddell as he drove his Volvo at 60mph in the wrong overtaking lane on March 11 last year.

Mr Colquhoun had just passed a car in the overtaking lane while another car in front of him moved into the inside lane
when Waddell’s Volvo came around a bend and the collision occurred.

Mr Colquhoun’s car then hit another a BMW convertible and burst into flames. He was killed instantly by the collision and not the 
flames, the court heard.

Waddell
and his wife, who were on their way to the theatre in Basingstoke from 
their then home in Andover Down, Hampshire, were also seriously injured 
and dragged from their smoking car by other motorists.

One dead: Dr Waddell travelled south on the northbound carriageway for about a mile at 60mph before colliding with Mr Colqhuhoun's car (left). Waddell's car is on the right

Killed: Mr Colqhuhoun died after Waddell collided with his car on the way home from work

The man, who had a clean driving 
licence, had also suffered a subdural haematoma he was unaware of before
the accident and had been confused prior to the crash.

The prosecution accepted this could have affected his judgment on whether he should drive.

He had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at an earlier hearing.

In
mitigation Charles Gabb said: ‘For a man who has dedicated his life to 
saving the lives of others, to be instrumental in the taking of one is a
shattering blow for him.’

Road markings unclear: Prosecutor Neil Sawyer told the court it was unclear how Waddell made the wrong turn but said road markings were 'adequate but could have been better'

Neil Sawyer, prosecuting, said: ‘It’s 
not clear how the defendant came to be on the wrong side of the road as 
his recollection of what happened is hazy.’

The barrister explained the best 
possibility was that the doctor had turned the wrong way at what is 
known locally as the Red Lion Pub junction onto the A30 where the road 
markings although ‘adequate, could have been better’.

These road markings have since been improved, the court was told.

Mr Gabb explained that on at least six other occasions, motorists had been confused by the road markings at the junction and had gone the wrong way - including in daylight - and that it was lucky no one else had been injured.

He said: ‘At first blush you think this is a case of an old man not paying attention but there is a fundamental problem here.’

Should not have been driving: Mr Colqhuhoun's family, (from left) brother Ross, mother Patricia and father Les Colquhoun appeared outside court today. Patricia said their son's life had been 'cruelly robbed'

Mr Gabb said Waddell, who had to be helped into the dock by his granddaughter and was using a zimmer frame, had found it difficult to come to terms with what he had done.

He said: ‘Having spent all his life in the service of others, the last thing he wanted to do was a result such as this.’

Confused prior to crash: Waddell was unaware that he had suffered a subdural haematoma which caused him confusion before the accident

Even so, the court heard that Waddell, 
now living in Porthcawl, near Bridgend, ignored no entry signs, road 
markings and the flashing lights of other motorists and drove for more 
than a minute on the wrong side of the road.

Judge Keith Cutler suspended the sentence for two years and disqualified Waddell from driving for life.

He said that Waddell’s eyesight was very worrying and added that if there was a message to come out the tragedy it was that doctors and relatives ‘look very, very carefully whether elderly people can drive’.

Speaking outside court, Mr Colquhoun’s mother Patricia said that the doctor should not have been behind the wheel.

She said: ‘When a driver reaches 70 all that he or she has to do is complete a form to say that they are medically fit and a driving licence is issued for another three years.

‘Though I acknowledge that there are many safe elderly drivers on our roads there are some who are not, and families are sometimes too afraid to confront their elderly relatives as to their failing abilities.

‘Through this lack of foresight my son, who had a wealth of friends and family who loved him dearly, and who had just started a new job with such high hopes and plans for the future, has been so cruelly robbed.’

Waddell moved to Wales to be near his wife, who has dementia and he visits her every day.
