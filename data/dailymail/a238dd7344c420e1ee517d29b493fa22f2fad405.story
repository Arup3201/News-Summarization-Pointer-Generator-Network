Heavy downpours and hail caused flash flooding in Bournemouth today as summer storms affected parts of Britain.

The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' warning for heavy rain for large parts of eastern England, eastern Scotland and Northern Ireland with the rain set to continue into tonight before easing off.

But not everywhere has been experiencing a deluge with Brighton remaining warm and sunny today as sunbathers took to a sunbasked Brighton beach.

However, in Brailey Road in Bournemouth, vehicles struggled to pass the surface water, caused by a flash flood, after a number of short and heavy downpours earlier today.

After heavy downpours, parts of Bournemouth Gardens had to be cordoned off due to flooding and Wessex Water were called in to help pump the water away.

In the town centre's the Primark store was also forced to evacuate customers and close its doors due to flooding.

According to the Met Office some parts of England and Wales saw 10 to 15 mm of rain in an hour, leading to localised flooding with places in Hampshire seeing 20mm of rainfall in just 60 minutes.

Heavy rain also affected the north-east of England and forced the accident and emergency department at South Tyneside District Hospital in South Shields to partially close due to flooding.

Steve Williamson, South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trustâ€™s chief operating officer, said: 'As a result of extremely heavy rain earlier today, flooding has affected parts of the South Tyneside District Hospital site.

Despite the torrential downpours today, the Met Office say the rain will clear later on this evening, with many enjoying a warm and sunny day tomorrow

'The majority of our patient services, including some operations and outpatients appointments, are going ahead as planned.

'However, we would request at this stage that patients avoid attending our A&E department and, where possible, find an alternative by going to another hospital A&E or a local minor injuries unit until further notice.

'Their co-operation would be much appreciated.'

The rain also caused disruption on the roads and the Tyne and Wear Metro and Northumbria Police added: 'We have received reports of localised flooding on some roads and motorists are being advised to take care on roads; drive safely and watch out for standing water.

'Drivers are urged to allow extra travel time, moderate their speed, use their lights appropriately and drive according to the conditions.'

But despite the heavy rain elsewhere in the country, Brighton was enjoying warm and sunny weather with sunseekers taking to Brighton beach

However, forecasters expect the worst of the rain to clear tonight, leaving many to experience a dry and warm day tomorrow.

Emma Sharples from the Met Office said: 'Tomorrow looks dry for much of the country with the showers on their way out.

'It will be fairly sunny and warm with the exception of the east coast, where it will become quite windy.

'The best of the sunshine will be in the south west of England, central southern England and across much of Scotland.

'It will become warm and humid as the week goes on, which will lead to some thundery downpours to develop with the outlook looking unsettled going into the weekend.'
