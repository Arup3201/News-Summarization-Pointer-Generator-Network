Under fire: Current HMRC chief Lin Homer

The head of the tax office is expected to face calls for her dismissal after the publication of a devastating verdict by MPs on her performance as a senior mandarin.

Lin Homer, chief executive of  HM Revenue & Customs, will come under intense pressure tomorrow when members of the influential Home Affairs Committee publish a report into her conduct.

It is expected to conclude she misled MPs and express ‘limited confidence’ in her ability to run Government departments.

A report by the committee into the running of the Border Agency, which covers her time as the agency’s head, is also likely to call for reform of Whitehall’s ‘revolving door’ system of appointments that allows senior officials to be awarded plum jobs even if they fail.

Ms Homer was appointed to HMRC in January 2012, after spending just a year as head of the Transport Department.

Prior to that, she spent four years as chief executive of the Border Agency – a period marked by a huge backlog  of asylum cases and scares over the release of hundreds of foreign criminals.

During her evidence to the committee, chaired by Labour MP Keith Vaz, Ms Homer refused to accept suggestions she should return any of the £20,000 in bonuses she received as head of UKBA.

It later emerged that in 40,000 cases, individuals could still be in the country and were potentially untraceable

She was quizzed over more than 100,000 
items of mail left unopened as staff struggled to deal with 147,000 
immigration case files, some dating back to the Nineties, parked in a 
‘controlled archive’.

It later emerged that in 40,000 cases, individuals could still be in the country and were potentially untraceable.

Ms Homer apologised that the cases had not been checked against up to 19 databases, including the Police National Computer and anti-terrorist watchlist, and said she regretted she may have ‘inadvertently misled’ the committee over the size of the backlog and whether security checks had been carried out.

Mr Vaz accepted her apology – but said if it happened again it would be reported to Parliament as a ‘contempt of the House’.

Tomorrow’s report is expected to express MPs’ fury that Ms Homer, 56, does not appear to accept she failed during her time as head of the UKBA – and cast doubt on her ability to carry out her duties at HMRC.

Ms Homer was paid almost £1 million in salary and bonuses during her time at the beleaguered agency. She is now paid £180,000 a year as head of HMRC.

The report is expected to conclude Parliament should be given a stronger role in appointing top civil servants – a view likely to be shared by No 10, where senior figures have expressed frustration at the way Whitehall tries to block key reforms and rejects interference over its appointments.
