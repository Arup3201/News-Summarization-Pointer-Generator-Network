The soldier, 25, tried to cheer up his fiancée Aimee West

Murdered fusilier Lee Rigby sent a heartfelt text to his fiancée trying to cheer her up just 20 minutes before he was slain in the street.

The soldier, 25, tried to cheer up his fiancée Aimee West, who was homesick in Afghanistan, telling her 'Princess, keep smiling for me.'

The military policewoman said the text continued: 'I know it is hard and you really want to come home but just remember I am always there for you and I will always love you no matter what. We are on the home stretch... you will always come first in my life xxxx'.

Miss West said she would always treasure that text message, and spoke of how she and Fusilier Rigby, from Middleton, had planned to get married in 2016, The Sun reported.

She spoke out after Michael Adebolajo, 29, received a rare whole-life term, while Michael Adebowale, 22, was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years at the Old Bailey.

The 23-year-old said she was relieved the soldier's killers will have to suffer the 'torture' of life in prison and not the death penalty.

Miss West admitted she was 'frightened' when these 'monsters' started attacking prison guards and yelling abuse at the judge, but Miss West said today it was a sign the killers had been beaten.

'It wouldn’t be torture for them to be killed, which is what they wanted. I want them to suffer and that’s what’s going to happen now,' she said.

Mayhem broke out in the courtroom as 
Drummer Rigby's remorseless killers disrupted proceedings when they were
 accused of a 'betrayal' of Islam.

British-born
 Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car before 
hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near 
Woolwich Barracks in south-east London on May 22 last year.

They both claimed that they were ‘soldiers of Allah’ and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing, which they called an 'act of war'.

As he was about to be jailed for life without parole Adebolajo shouted Allahu Akbhar, and Adebowale called out ‘that's a lie’ and ‘it's not a betrayal of Islam’ as the judge told them they had been radicalised.

Miss West said she would always treasure the text that the fusilier sent, promising to 'always love her'

Adebowale then screamed 'You (Britain) and America will never be safe'.

The prisoners were dragged down to the cells - one head first – and could be heard banging on the ceilings below after being taken down as the judge condemned their 'barbaric' murder.  

Outside the court right-wing protesters set up gallows and demanded the return of the death penalty, which was abolished completely in 1969.

Speaking about their relationship, she revealed they fell in love in August 2012 when they met at an Army Cadets training event in Wales.

She said Lee would 'follow me around like a little sheep' and after they returned home he asked her out.

The 25-year-old father-of-one was then estranged from his wife Rebecca, who he had his son Jack with, and was getting a divorce.

The following year, before the military police woman flew away for a tour of Afghanistan, he proposed and she accepted.

She told The Sun: 'He's really soppy and I'm not. He got down on one knee. I just said "Yes" straight away. He had asked my mum's permission before going down on his knee.'

But it was while she was there that he was cruelly taken from her.

Miss West is now running the Paris Marathon to raise money for the Lee Rigby Fund, which she supports and which helps military families.
