When Francis Benali arrives at St Mary's on Saturday, he'll be emotional.

The former Southampton hardman may even shed a tear, perhaps not something you would expect from a man of his reputation.

But consider this. How would you feel after running close to 1,000 miles in three weeks?

Pretty emotional, probably.

Power: The former Southampton full-back poses by the pitch after reaching Leicester's King Power stadium

Well, when Benali reaches the final stop of his tour of all 20 Barclays Premier League grounds ahead of Southampton's clash against West Ham this weekend, that's exactly what he would have achieved.

Twenty-one days of agony, ice-baths and sleep deprivation - all in aid of Cancer Research UK.

'I've always been interested in extreme challenges such as this and the idea to do something like this has been floating around in my head for about three years now,' Benali told Sportsmail.

'And then came the moment where I just thought: "It's now or never". I always wanted a challenge to be based around football given I used to be professional, so this sounded like a perfect idea - though halfway through, I'm not so sure now!

Emotional: Although the physical pain is tough, it's the mental test that Benali is finding hardest

'The idea of seeing how far you can push yourself has always intrigued me.'

Benali, now 45, knows a thing or two about putting his body through the mill.

Over 300 league appearances for the Saints between 1988 and 2004 speaks for itself.

But the former Saints full-back is quick to point out that his years as a Premier League footballer pales in comparison to his current challenge of running, on average, 50 miles a day.

Helping out: Benali battles with Alan Shearer but his former teammate is helping him along the way

'Obviously the pain threshold is the biggest difficulty you face,' said Benali.

'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally, this is more about the mind when you can barely put one foot in front of the other.

'Nothing can prepare you for that. The extent of my training was going on a 40 miler, but I had two days off after that.

'So you know you can run the distance, it' just having the mindset to tell yourself you have to do it everyday. That's the hardest thing.

'Some days you get through it, some days you can hardly put one foot in front of each other.

Stretching the limits: Running an average of 50 miles a day, some days Benali runs longer than he sleeps

'Some days I finish running, take an ice bath, eat and fall straight into bed and have to do it all over again. Some days I'm running longer in a day than I'm sleeping at night.

'Some days I just can't eat anything, I have no appetite. Obviously my support team are keen for me to stay sufficiently refuelled for the next day, but some days I just can't physically eat anything.

'That is perhaps the hardest thing. The running, yes, it's painful but you get through it.

'But it's the mental and emotional battle that is the hardest to deal with. All the days are blurring into one at the moment.

'The other day I just burst into tears when I finished for the day after seeing my family. You don't expect that to happen.

Mental strength: 'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally,' says Benali

'You can prepare physically, but it's the emotional side you can't prepare for. But that was part of the intrigue for me, how far you can push yourself, what your limits are.'

Thankfully, Benali has been helped along the way during his gruelling personal battle across England's footballing landscape.

He's managed to rope former team-mates Alan Shearer, Matt Le Tissier and James Beattie into helping him along on certain legs, while current top-flight stars Dean Hammond and Danny Ings have also lent their support.

Southampton's promising start to the season will have also helped Benali's mood along the way.

Many had tipped the south-coast club as relegation contenders following the departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham, as well as the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren.

But under the guidance of new manager Ronald Koeman, Southampton have lost just one from their opening three game - a narrow defeat at Liverpool.

Exhausted: By the time he arrives at St Mary's on Saturday Benali will have been to all 20 grounds

Hardman: The fullback had a reputation as a tough guy but he admits to breaking down during this journey

Staying positive: Benali believes that Koeman's men can have a good season despite a tough summer

'People had Saints tagged as relegation candidates, but I was always pretty confident, I suppose I'm always a confident and positive person,' added Benali

'People were questioning why were selling so many players, in many ways we were victims of our own success. But Koeman needed time to get his players in and he looks to have signed some real real quality there.

'So I was never one who feared the worst.'

You'll need all that positive thinking this week, Francis.
