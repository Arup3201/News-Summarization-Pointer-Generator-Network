Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will announce the scheme on Monday

Senior civil servants in the Department of Health will have to work on the frontline of the NHS if they want to be promoted, the Health Secretary is to announce.

From next month, 200 senior officials will have to perform tasks such as mopping floors, emptying bedpans and serving meals to care home residents as the Government responds to the Francis Report into patient neglect at the Mid Staffordshire Trust.

The plans, to be unveiled on Monday by Jeremy Hunt, will require top Whitehall officials to perform roles such as GP receptionist and hospital porter for a total of four weeks a year for six years.

It will be rolled out to all 2,000 of the department's civil servants later this year.

Those who do not clock up their frontline hours will miss out on opportunities to climb the Whitehall ladder.

'This will not be a clip-board 
exercise,' a Whitehall source told the Times.

'Officials will not do jobs they 
are untrained for like nursing but they will be getting a clearer idea 
of what it is like to be a patient.'

The Francis Report, published in March, described how patients at Mid Staffordshire had been left ‘unwashed, unfed and without fluids’ and ‘deprived of their dignity’.

But it concluded that such failings were not a ‘rare event’ and almost certainly existed at other hospitals across the country.

The report made 290 recommendations to how the NHS and Department of Health should improve patient care.

It urged health officials to make more effort to get out of Whitehall and meet patients.

Civil servants will have to complete four weeks of work as hospital porters, cleaners, and GP receptionists a year

Last week Mr Hunt manned the phones at GP surgeries in Kennington and Wandsworth, south London.

He has also spent time as a hospital porter and cleaner in two of the capital's accident and emergency departments.

'To understand more about what 
patients and service users need and the issues which are important to 
them, civil servants need to walk a mile in their shoes,' he told the Times.
