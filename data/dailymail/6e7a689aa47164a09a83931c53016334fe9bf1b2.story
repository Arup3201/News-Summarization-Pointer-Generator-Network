An former Halifax worker has been jailed for five years after stealing more than £750,000 from the high street bank's cash machine.

Benjamin Sookia, 26, was imprisoned for five years after raiding ATM machines and bank accounts for the cash.

He stole £187,155 in cash as well as fraudulently syphoning £565,000 electronically.

In court: Benjamin Sookia, 26, was jailed for five years after stealing £750,000 from cash machines

Sookia, who had held the junior position for six years, was investigated in July last year after irregularities were noticed in his personal accounts.

He raided the non-customer account from his branch in Redditch, Worcestershire, between September 2001 and July 11 last year.

Sookia, from Redditch, was arrested by officers from West Mercia Police's Economic Crime Unit last August.

As a counter worker in the bank he was responsible for topping up the cash in the ATM machines when they got low.

He stole physical cash from the machines he was meant to be filling before switching to moving money electronically into his own account.

He was charged with three offences of theft by an employee and a further three of fraud by abuse of position on January 16.

He was jailed at Worcester Crown Court for five years.
