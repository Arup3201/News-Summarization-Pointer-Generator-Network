A new report claims that shocking video of two Western men abusing a Korean woman at a nightclub in Seoul was staged - and that the villains in the footage were actually paid actors.

When the video was posted online in June, it caused fury in Korea and in the West. Many Koreans said that it only proved their suspicions about Western expatriates living in Korea. Westerners were horrified about how it portrayed ex-pats.

Now, the Washington Post reports that the men are speaking out, anonymously, and claiming they were paid $90 to play roles and that the entire horrifying scene was 'all in good fun.'

A Korean man who claims to be the 'director' of the film showed the Post two alternate takes from the same video - which seems to support the story about the footage being from a planned film shoot.

Disturbing: This image grab from a video uploaded to YouTube shows a Western man grabbing a young Korean woman by the face as she tries to push him away

Abuse: But despite the woman's protestations, the man continues to force her face towards the camera

The
original 78-second clip shows a young Western club-goer with an 
American accent grabbing the woman around her face before repeatedly 
poking her in her mouth and nose while a third person films it.

After
poking the woman in nose, the man then can be heard shouting: 'I see a 
booger' while his friend eggs him on, saying: 'Dude, make her eat it.'Â 

The two men can then be heard laughing as he pushes his finger in to her mouth at the unnamed nightclub in South Korea.

They then continue to abuse the girl by telling her she is disgusting and tells her she needs plastic surgery 'like every other little Korean'.

The woman, who appears to be worse-for-wear, apparently tells the man to leave her alone and tries to push him away.

But he continue to harass her by grabbing at her face and body until she eventually manages to get free and leaves.

Cruelty: The Western man then continues to poke her in the face while telling the person filming: 'I can see a booger' who then replies: 'Dude, make her eat it'

Shame: The Korean woman tries to push the man away as he tells her she is 'disgusting' and should have plastic surgery 'just like every other little Korean'

Since the release of the video the men have reached out to numerous ex-pat and Western news sources in Korea proclaiming their innocence.

However, their evidence that the video was actually staged as a movie is shaky at best.

They said they were paid in cash by the Korean man who recruited them and could not provide a name of the film company he worked with or the movie he was working on.

The video was shot on an iPhone and they have no pay stubs to prove they were hired as actors.

The only proof is a screen shot of a Facebook chat between one of the actors an the supposed director.

The video quickly went viral after it was uploaded to YouTube and embedded on the Korean Web portal Jagei.com on June 8 and has been covered by the South Korean press.

The publicity has sparked a widespread debate over the way Western tourists treat women while visiting South Korea.
