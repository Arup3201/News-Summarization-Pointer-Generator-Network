Eriksen, who has scored nine goals this season, as formed a deadly partnership with Harry Kane in the final third and has proved a vital cog in the Tottenham midfield.

With the Champions League in their sights, Spurs can go level on points with fourth placed United if they can pick up three points at Old Trafford.

And following their north London rivals Arsenal's victory over Louis van Gaal's side on Monday in the FA Cup, Eriksen and his team mates will be confident they get something in Manchester and boost their Champions League chances.
