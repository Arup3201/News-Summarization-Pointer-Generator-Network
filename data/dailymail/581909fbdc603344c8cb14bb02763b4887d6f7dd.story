Luke Foley has been elected unopposed as leader of the NSW Labor Party.

It was a result which was widely expected after Mr Foley's main rival for the leadership, Shadow Treasurer Michael Daley, pulled out of the running last week when the ALP head office threw its support behind Mr Foley.

Mr Foley, who is Shadow Environment and Planning Minister, replaces John Robertson as Opposition Leader who quit after admitting to have signed a letter on behalf of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, as his local MP, back in 2011.

Luke Foley has taken over the hot-seat as ALP leader in New South Wales after John Robertson's recent shock resignation

John Robertson stepped down as NSW Opposition Leader and leader of his party in the state after revelations he had signed a letter for Sydney siege suspect Man Haron Monis as his local MP, some three years before the tragic events which led to the death of two hostages and brought the city to a standstill

The government has already accused Mr Foley as being a representative of 'the faceless men' of the Australian Labor Party.

State Treasurer Andrew Constance claims 'Luke Fole,  a former union boss, a former Labor Party official, has been installed by the faceless men of Labor's head office'.

'One minute, Michael Daley is telling everyone this is coming down to the wire and there would be a ballot, a day later he has pulled out.

'A further example that Labor's head office runs the show and that democracy is dead within the Labor caucus when Labor Party members aren't even given the ability to determine their leader.'

John Robertson was forced to reveal how he once helped the Sydney siege gunman plea for access to his children on Father’s Day.

Mr Robertson signed a letter to the Department of Family and Community Services on behalf of Man Haron Monis, a constituent in his western Sydney electorate of Blacktown, in 2011.

He said that he'd 'made a conscious decision that my office would be there to serve everyone in the Blacktown community. However I accept how this may appear given recent events'.

Monis notoriously kept 18 terrified people hostage, shooting two dead, during a near 17-hour siege in the Lindt café in Sydney’s Martin Place.

Mr Robertson has admitted to having assisted Monis when he was seeking visitation rights for his two children from his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal. 

Mr Foley was the only nominee for the party's leadership and was elected unopposed. Linda Burney will continue to serve as deputy leader.

NSW is due to go to the polls in March, with the Mike Baird-led coalition, which itself has been crippled by ICAC-driven resignations, still heavily favoured to be returned.

Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, was shot dead after taking hostages at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place last month. Two other people died, 33-year-old cafe manager Tori Johnson and 38-year-old Sydney barrister Katrina Dawson

People from the Lindt Cafe, Martin Place during a hostage stand-off on December 16 in Sydney. Police stormed the cafe after Man Haron Monis had gunned down one of those held inside. Former NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson resigned over a letter he'd signed for the gunman three years earlier

Mr Foley, 44, will now try to switch from the upper house of parliament to the lower house.

He's expected to push to become the ALP's candidate for the western Sydney seat of Auburn, held by Labor's Barbara Perry.

Mr Foley is from the party's left faction and a devoted Catholic who opposes gay marriage.

'I assume the leadership of the NSW Labor party with great pride and humility,' he said.

Mr Foley is married with three children - Aoife, Niamh and Patrick.
