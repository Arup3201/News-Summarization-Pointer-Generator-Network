At only 12 years of age, Nicole Graney was facing a battle she had never anticipated fighting, and one that she didn't fully understand.

The very new teenager who had only just entered high school in Sydney had been diagnosed with a very adult disease- ovarian cancer.

'I had a doctor's appointment in the middle of the day, and had to leave school. I remember telling my friends that I would only be gone for an hour,' Nicole, now 16, told Daily Mail Australia.

However, she didn't anticipate the ultrasound revealing that the hard lump in her stomach needed urgent surgery to remove it.

'My mum was in the room with me and was in shock. When we got out to the waiting room she started crying and calling people, but I just stood there thinking to myself "what's happening?",' Nicole said. 

'I remember being wheeled into surgery and seeing mum and saying goodbye to her because I might not see her again. That was one of the scariest moments of my life,' she said. 

'I was pretty naive, I thought that it was a cyst and that the doctors would be able to drain it out with a needle and I'd have a pinprick scar,' she said.

Instead, Nicole left with a 15 centimetre scar and the new knowledge that the lump that had been removed was actually ovarian cancer.  

'When I found out I fell into shock, I didn't know what to think or do,' Nicole said. 

Before undergoing chemotherapy to fight the ovarian cancer, Nicole had long red hair

During the treatment, Nicole lost her hair and gained 27 kilograms which made her very self-conscious

'I'd seen people in my family going through the same thing. My cousin was nine when he died of a brain tumour, and it was shocking seeing him go through the transformation when he had been such a healthy boy,' she said.

'All I could think was, "Is that going to happen to me?".' 

Nicole, who said she was overwhelmed by the diagnosis, decided not to tell any of her school friends and kept her cancer a secret out of fear that they would treat her differently.

The high school student went through one cycle of chemotherapy each month, consisting of a week of chemotherapy, a week of recovery and two weeks at school, before the exhausting process would begin again.

'The nausea was the worst. I was put on really harsh drugs and got awful headaches and it turned me off food, but then after the chemo I couldn't stop eating,' Nicole said. 

'I had a lot of support at the start and by this point my friends had figured out what was going on and my school actually held a fundraiser for me,' she said.

'I had a lot of support at the start and by this point my friends had figured out what was going on and my school actually held a fundraiser for me,' Nicole said

'But towards the end it got so tough, and I begged not to go into the last cycle. I was just so tired and drained.' 

In six months Nicole had put on 27 kilograms from the treatment and had lost her hair. She used a wig in her natural red hair colour and would rarely let anyone see her without it on. 

'It was a huge blow to my social life and how I felt about my appearance. I always tried to be strong for myself but it was very hard,' she said.

'I remember asking my dad, "how can you love me? How can anyone love me?". I had no hair, I had put on a lot of weight.'

'Towards the end of it I remember asking my dad, "how can you love me? How can anyone love me?". I had no hair, I had put on a lot of weight,' Nicole said

Once Nicole had completed the chemotherapy treatments she was no longer eligible to attend support groups, as she was technically not considered a 'cancer kid' any longer.

'I had that taken away from me, and then when I went to school I was the kid with cancer. I was excluded from both normalities,' she said.

'It took a lot of time for me to get used to myself and other people, which I actually consider harder than the treatment.'

Four years on from her diagnosis, Nicole is preparing for her HSC and has dreams of working as a medical professional herself.

While she said she has been very blessed with a group of loving friends and a great boyfriend, she said she still has to think about how the cancer will impact her future.

The ovarian cancer means that she may not be able to have children in the future, a thought which she said it 'pretty crazy'.

While Nicole said that she is still very conscious of her looks and how she presents herself to people

'When I was going through the treatment I always just thought that I would worry about babies later. But realising that if I do find someone that I want to spend my life with and that I might not be able to give them or myself the life we want is scary,' Nicole said.   

The 16-year-old said that she is determined to 'do something great' with her life, and is passionate about raising awareness about ovarian cancer.

'I was dealt some pretty bad cards early in life and I'm adamant to turn it around and make the most of it,' Nicole said.

While Nicole said that she is still very conscious of her looks and how she presents herself to people, she said it reminds her to be the best possible version of herself that she can be. 

'I have had some amazing opportunities come from something not so great, and so I want to do something not just for me but for other people,' she said.

Nicole is passionate about reminding cancer sufferers that there is always support available, no matter what they are going through.

'If I can help someone or if someone knows they're not alone in experiencing cancer, if I can bring comfort to help someone by sharing my story, then that's what this has all been about,' she said.
