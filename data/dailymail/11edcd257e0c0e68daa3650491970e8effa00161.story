England coach Gary Neville is the prime target as a pundit for BT Sport when they start assembling their analyst team for the Champions League in 2015-16.

BT, who have just signed up Ian Wright and Robbie Savage for the next Premier League campaign, have no reservations about sharing their on screen talent with other networks.

And they see Neville, who has built a solid reputation on Sky over the last two years, as the best possible choice to help launch their £897million, three-year deal for European football.

Target: BT Sport want Gary Neville (right) as a pundit for their Champions League coverage in 2015-16

However, although ITV and BBC have raised no objections to Wright and Savage also appearing on BT, there is a zero chance of Sky willingly allowing Neville to moonlight.

And BT chiefs even suggesting that Neville will be asked whether he would like to continue working on the flagship CL after next season is sure to antagonise arch-rivals Sky.

Neville already has plenty to occupy him with his TV and England roles along with being a Manchester United ambassador and having property and hotel interests.

It is intriguing that Manchester United 
deputy chairman Ed Woodward entertained the club’s press pack to dinner 
in Manchester just 24 hours after axed manager David Moyes hosted 
football journalists in Miami. Let battle commence.

FIFA have mounted an investigation into how the PricewaterhouseCoopers probe into Mohamed bin Hammam commissioned by the Asian Football Confederation and the tranche of emails were allegedly leaked out of Zurich and hawked around to potential sellers for a number of weeks.

PwC would not comment about any legal action over the publication of their confidential information. Meanwhile could it be, as the conspiracy theory doing the rounds suggests, that the extensive coverage of the Qatar controversy in the Murdoch press is somehow connected with the worldwide battle for TV supremacy between Qatar-based Al Jazeera and the Murdoch empire?

It has emerged that FIFA director of 
finance Marcus Kattner was responsible for rubber-stamping the massive 
Zurich spend on the FIFA history film United Passions. President Sepp 
Blatter, played by gangster role specialist Tim Roth, was determined to 
bankroll the production despite strong opposition to do so from inside 
Zurich. FIFA say the multi-million expense will be included in this 
year’s financial accounts.

Meanwhile, FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke is furious with German media for revealing that his 26-year-old son Sebastien is working as an assistant general co-ordinator at the Maracana during the World Cup, calling the story ‘pathetic’. Valcke, whose son performed the same role in Cape Town in 2010 said: ‘He accepted the position without consulting me and I did not intervene in his choice.’

Yet another obstacle for David Beckham in his problematic ambition to build a stadium for his MLS franchise on the Miami waterfront is the contract that the neighbouring Miami Heat basketball team have for their county-owned arena  — with a new five-year extension lease until 2035  agreed this week.

There is a ‘non-compete’ clause barring Miami-Dade county from providing direct or indirect monetary support for a rival entertainment venue with no provision to exempt a soccer stadium. The Beckham camp say they are not seeking any cash subsidies.

Steve Peters, sports psychiatrist with 
the England team, is amenable to giving consultations to the press party
 following the national team, provided manager Roy Hodgson agrees. It’s 
difficult to judge who is more in need of some urgent mental exercises, 
some of the more loony hacks or England’s penalty-takers.

England’s Royal Tulip hotel base in Rio may have had out-of-date food — including butter, salmon and Parma ham — taken away by health inspectors, but England’s West Ham chef Tim De’Ath is confident enough about the local produce available — especially the meat and fish — that he is only bringing in breakfast cereals from the UK.
