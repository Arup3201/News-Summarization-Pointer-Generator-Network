One of the Woolwich killers decided to convert to Islam after being inspired by a hate preacher who advocates killing gays and beating women, he has revealed in a letter.

Michael Adebowale, 22, said that lectures posted online by notorious firebrand cleric Sheikh Khalid Yasin taught him the ‘purpose of life’.

In the note written from Belmarsh Prison, he said he made the decision to convert to Islam in 2009 – around the same time that he was serving half of a 15-month sentence for supplying heroin.

Victim: Adebowale helped murder Fusilier Lee Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks in May this year

The letter, which uses his prisoner number A0882CY, is dated December
 20 – the day after he was convicted of Lee Rigby’s murder.

 'I have always been Muslim for nearly five years. I have always been a fairly spiritual person and most of my friends at that time were Muslims.

'So the combination of the two factors caused me to start learning more about Islam.

'The more I learnt the more interested I became which led to me listening to a lecture by Sheikh Khalid Yaseen, you may have heard of him?

'He is based in the US. The title of the lecture is called "What is the purpose of Life".

After hearing this I had to conclude that the purpose of life is to acknowledge and worship the creation as Allah said in Surat Az-Zaariyat:

'"I did not create the Jinn-kind and mankind except to worship me."'

Recalling
 his introduction to the religion, he wrote: ‘I have been Muslim for 
nearly five years. I have always been a fairly spiritual person and most
 of my friends at that time were Muslims.

‘So the combination of the two factors caused me to start learning more about Islam.’

He added: ‘The more I learnt the more interested I became which led to me listening to a lecture by Sheikh Khalid Yasin.

‘The
 title of this lecture is called “What is the Purpose of Life?” After 
hearing this I had to conclude that the purpose of life is to 
acknowledge and worship the creator.’

Yasin, who calls the 
Taliban his ‘brothers’, has been given free rein to tour the world and 
spread his vile views – stopping off in countries including Britain and 
the US.

Linked to the hardline Wahhabi branch of Islam, he has 
previously denounced both Christian and Jewish beliefs as ‘filth’ and 
believes there can be no such thing as gender equality.

He claims that 
the Koran gives men permission to ‘beat women lightly’ and thinks all 
Muslims should shun anyone who does not follow their faith.

He has also called homosexuality an ‘aberration’ that should be ‘punishable by death’.

Guilty: Adebowale, left, and Michael Adebolajo, right, were convicted of murder earlier this month

Alienated: Adebowale's mother Juliet Obasuyi has spoken out against his horrific crimes

And DVDs of his sermons were given to would-be jihadists who were being recruited in Britain’s streets to fight in Afghanistan.

Adebowale
 and his accomplice Michael Adebolajo, 29, were convicted earlier this 
month of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich.

Both
 killers were also inspired by Anjem Choudary and Adebolajo was filmed 
standing alongside  the hate cleric at demonstrations.

The pair, who 
were brought up in Christian families, face spending the rest of their 
lives behind bars when they are sentenced next year. 

The hand-written 
letter is the first insight into the mind of Adebowale, who refused to 
give evidence during the Old Bailey trial.

His fragile mental 
state repeatedly delayed court proceedings  as his barristers claimed he
 could not face the dock or make important decisions about his defence. 

In it, he complained that his family did not understand his views, 
writing: ‘They aren’t Muslim so I never get that “click” with them. May 
Allah forgive their mistakes.’

He also wrote of his 
disappointment that he has been ‘ill-judged’ and offered ‘little 
support’ from  fellow Muslims who were appalled  by the atrocity.

Writing from  his solitary confinement cell, he said: ‘The trial has now
 come to  an end and me and my brother  in Islam are waiting till next 
year  as the case was adjourned for sentencing.

Hate speech: Yasin has previously called for gay people to be put to death

Controversy: The preacher was born in New York City and converted to Islam as a teenager

‘I have had little support as you can imagine, many people are shocked and many Muslims sadly ill-judged me, Allah help them.’

Adebowale also said he had changed his name to Ismail ‘because I knew about the Prophet Ismail from Christianity’.

Adebowale and Adebolajo said they killed Mr Rigby in May in revenge for British troops being in Muslim countries.

They
 ran him over in a car, almost decapitated him and then dragged him into
 the middle of the road and ordered onlookers to film them.

Prime Minister David Cameron has now created an extremism taskforce which aims to stop radical leaders inciting hatred.
