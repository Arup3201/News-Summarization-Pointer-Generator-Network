This is the moment an enraged bull elephant flipped over a car containing a British teacher and her fiance during an African safari.

Sarah Brooks, 30, and her fiance were filming the animal from their car as it drank at a waterhole when it turned and went for them.

It flipped their vehicle and shunted it around 130ft down a track into thick bushland.

The terrifyingly angry animal pushed the car on to its roof with ease and then trampled on it

The elephant’s tusk ripped through Miss Brooks’ upper thigh during the ordeal at  the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

The attack was filmed by tourists travelling in a car behind.

The teacher, from Spalding in Lincolnshire, was airlifted to hospital where she required several days of treatment.

She
 has since been discharged and is believed to still be in the country 
recovering with her fiance Jans de Klerk, who escaped unhurt.

The
 couple were on holiday to celebrate their recent engagement and for 
Miss Brooks to meet her fiance’s South African family, friends said.

Park
 officials later shot the elephant which was in musth, a periodic 
condition in males that makes them aggressive when their testosterone 
levels rise by up to 60 times. It also had an injury, which is believed 
to have increased its aggressiveness.

African
 bull elephants can weigh up to six tons. Describing the December 30 
attack, park spokesman William Mabasa said: ‘The elephant suddenly 
stopped, turned around and rapidly walked towards the vehicle, which was
 stationary.

‘It charged at them, attacked the vehicle and flipped it over off the road into the thick bushes.’

Miss
 Brooks, who studied biomedical science at Northumbria University and 
now teaches at a school in Spalding, was discharged from the Medi-Clinic
 Nelspruit earlier this week.

Neighbours at the home she shares with her fiance said yesterday that she was yet to return from South Africa.

Lyn
 Skells, a retired teacher who has been friends with Mr de Klerk for 
three years, said the couple have extended their stay for another three 
weeks as they recover from their ordeal.

She
 said: ‘They had just got engaged and were on holiday so she could meet 
all his family in Africa. It really is awful what happened at what 
should have been a happy time for them.’

The attack was believed to be the third by an elephant at the Kruger park last year.

Another
 of the animals was shot dead earlier in December when it charged at 
traffic officers. It had apparently ignored warning shots.

Two tourists were also injured when their vehicle was overturned by an elephant in April.

And
 British pensioner Colin Manvell, 68, was trampled to death by a wild 
bull elephant while bird-watching at a jungle waterhole in Tamil Nadu, 
southern India, last year.

Mr Mabasa advised park visitors to keep a safe distance from wild animals.
