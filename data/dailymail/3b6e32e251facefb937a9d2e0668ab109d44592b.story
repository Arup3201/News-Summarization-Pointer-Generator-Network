The Daniel Fast is based on the fasts of the Old Testament prophet Daniel (pictured)

There are diets that involve substituting food for air and others that see slimmers consume alcohol instead of a meal.

Now, there is also the so-called God diet.

Officially known as the Daniel Fast, the diet sees people eat nothing but fruit, vegetables and whole grains.

Followers only drink water and avoid eating meat, fish, bread and any sweetened or processed foods.

The eating plan is based on that followed by the Old Testament prophet, Daniel.

It is fasting in the sense that followers cut back, rather than stop eating food altogether - in a similar vein to the the 5:2 plan (where followers eat a restricted diet two days a week).

Susan Gregory, author of The Daniel Fast, explained that the plan is based on his recorded fasting experiences.

In a video, she explains that Daniel was among a group of men captured by Babylon and that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon wanted the men to be in top condition - so insisted they eat the same food as he ate.

But when Daniel was served this food, he refused it, as he was committed to God and felt the food had not been prepared according to Jewish standards.

He also believed it had been sacrificed to false gods.

Daniel 1:8 states: 'But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank.'

Instead, Ms Gregory says, he vowed to eat nothing but foods grown from seeds and drink only water.

Later, Daniel fasted again while seeking God's word on the future of Israel and described this fast as involving no meat, wine or leavened bread.

Daniel 10:3 states: 'I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks.'

These biblical descriptions of Danielâ€™s fasts form the basis of the new eating plan.

Ms Gregory, who described the Daniel Fast as a 'vegan diet with even more restrictions', says following the diet involves avoiding caffeine, chemicals and sugar and, as a result, it can ease headaches, leg cramps and fatigue.

She added it can also cause people's cholesterol levels to fall and their blood sugar levels to balance out.

The author adds that the diet often leads to weight loss and 'a general feeling of wellbeing'.

However she adds that, while the diet is a very healthy way to eat, people with health problems might need to modify it.

It sees people eat nothing other than fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Followers also drink nothing other than water and avoid sweetened and processed foods

For example, she accepts that people with diabetes might need to eat more carbohydrates and that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers might need to add fish, chicken and cheese.

Sarah Neumann, from Michigan, tried the Daniel Fast as a religious exercise and without considering the weight loss that could go with it.

She told The Atlantic that she initially struggled with it when eating in restaurants or with friends.

However, she says she lost weight while on the diet and she still has a healthier diet as a result.

'Since the experience I've lost a lot of weight just from learning how to have more self-control,' she said.

But nutritionist Zoe Harcombe is unconvinced by the health benefits of following the diet.

She explained to MailOnline that the health impacts it would depend on how long someone follows it for.

Nutritionists say there are some benefits to the diet as it sees people cut out junk food, white flour, sugar and processed foods. However, they also say it could lead to shortages in many vital vitamins

She said that if they only follow it for a few days, it would not cause too many problems.

But longer than that could cause them to become deficient in numerous vitamins - especially those found in animal products.

She said the diet is good in the sense that it involves cutting out junk food, sugar, white flour and processed foods.

This reduces the chance of obesity and lowers a person's risk of some cancers, heart disease and diabetes.

But, she added that followers would miss out on Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E and Vitamin B12.

A lack of Vitamin A can, in extreme cases, lead to blindness, a shortage of Vitamin D can cause muscle weakness and bone pain and a deficiency of Vitamin E could cause the immune system to be weakened.

She explained that, as a result, anyone following the diet for longer than a few days would need to take vitamin supplements to avoid health problems.
