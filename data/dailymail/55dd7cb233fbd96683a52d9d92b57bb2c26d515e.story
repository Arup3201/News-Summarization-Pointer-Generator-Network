A Queensland couple killed on flight MH17 have been remembered as the selfless doctors they were at a memorial service in their honour.

Friends and family of Roger and Jill Guard packed out a theatre in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, on Sunday to pay their respects.

The couple, who left behind three adult children and two grandkids, had called Toowoomba home for 30 years.

Roger had spent 25 years as the director of pathology at Toowoomba Base Hospital, providing evidence for many coronial inquests, while his wife of almost 42 years, Jill, was a GP.

The Guards had run the Queensland city's Road Runners and helped Sudanese women adjust to new life in Australia.

The farmer's son and Congregational minister's daughter were among 298 people, including up to 39 Australian citizens, who died when Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was shot down over the Ukraine more than a fortnight ago.

The couple's son Paul told the memorial service he and his siblings were glad their parents were together on their final adventure

The Guards' three adult children Paul, a coastal engineer, Amanda, a physiotherapist, and David, a pathologist like his dad, spoke of their love for their talented parents who explored the world with them

More than 1,000 people packed into Toowoomba's Empire Theatre on Sunday afternoon to remember the couple through song, music and poetry.

The Guards' three adult children Paul, a coastal engineer, Amanda, a physiotherapist, and David, a pathologist like his dad, spoke of their love for their talented parents who explored the world with them.

'We're glad that you are together on your final adventure doing something you love,' eldest son Paul said.

Jill's sister Cathy recalled how the couple met at university.

Amanda Guard spoke to more than 1,000 people packed into Toowoomba's Empire Theatre on Sunday afternoon

'It was while studying medicine that she acquired a skeleton from a young doctor, Roger Guard,' she said.

'When Roger turned up with the skeleton, he inadvertently locked the keys in his jeep.

'Apparently, Jill volunteered to clamber in the vehicle through a partly opened window and thus began a relationship.'

Luke Johnson from the Toowoomba Road Runners humorously remembered Roger's many titles during his three decades with the club.

'He spent many years as our club president, race co-ordinator, marketing director, social convenor, course designer, chief morale officer, recruitment driver, fashion designer - yes, this is one of Roger's creations which I'm proudly modelling today for you,' he said.

Neighbour and friend Sue Dowe remembered Jill's 20-year dedication to meals on wheels and her help for Sudanese migrant women through the Toowoomba Refugee and Migrant Support group.

'She possessed a huge amount of energy, a fine intelligence, compassion, generosity, modesty, good looks, a loving, caring, selfless nature and musical and artistic talent,' she said.
