Joe Root and some of his England team-mates took advantage of the early finish to the Oval Test against India and hit the town.

The Yorkshire batsman was photographed looking a little bleary eyed as emerged from royal favourite Boujis in central London as he celebrated the 3-1 series victory over the Indians.

Root, 23, his county colleague Gary Ballance and Sam Robson were reportedly the last men standing in the early hours of Monday morning.

Root has had his moments in nightclubs over the past year.

He was pictured smoking outside a bar in Manchester after England secured the Ashes at Old Trafford and, earlier that summer, was punched by David Warner in a Birmingham Walkabout. 

Root did, however, have plenty to celebrate as he was the highest scoring batsmen in the series, which England won after being 1-0 down.

The No 5 scored 518 runs at an average of 103.6 with two centuries, including one on the final day at The Kia Oval.
