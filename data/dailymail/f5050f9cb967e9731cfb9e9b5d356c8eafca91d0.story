Tragic: Daylan Walker, pictured, fell to his death from the Dorchester, Massachusetts facility Wednesday morning

A two-year-old boy has tragically died after he fell off the roof of his day care center.

Police aren't releasing many details about Daylan Walker's tragic death at the Dorchester, Massachusetts facility Wednesday morning, but Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson confirmed the child fell to his death.

'Unfortunately, it sounds like the child was at some point left unattended,' Jackson, who visited the scene, told the Boston Globe. 'Sadly, part of our future is gone today.'

The child appeared to have 'suffered fatal trauma after falling from a building,' a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said.

His distraught mother Leonella Rivera said she dropped the boy at the center before heading to work.

She said the day care texted her a picture of her son, showing he was happy, at around 9 a.m., but just 15 minutes later she received a call from police saying he was dead.

Rivera is furious her son was left unsupervised long enough to make his way to the roof.

'He's been going to that daycare for two weeks and a half. How a 2-year-old baby got out of her house on the first floor and reached the roof, how? This is not fair,' she told 7News.

'Nothing like that should be done to any mother. My son was just a baby, was just growing up. I want justice for my son, I want justice.'

Rivera, who has no other children, went on: 'This death of my son cannot just stay like that, we need to find out what really happened.'

Jackson told 7News that investigators believe Daylan wandered out of his first floor day care center and walked up four flights of stairs before pushing through a heavy door onto the roof. That's when he apparently tumbled off.

Jackson is demanding to know why the toddler was left alone and how he was able to push through the door.

After Daylan's death, the city's Inspectional Services Department issued a violation report that found the door leading to the roof must be 'manually slammed shut to engage panic hardware.'

A company called Urban Edge owns the building the day care center is housed in but the owner didn't comment on the violation.

'We're deeply saddened by the tragedy and are cooperating with all the authorities,' said Christal Kornegay, the company's president and chief executive officer, told the Globe.

'This is a nightmare,' the child's grandmother, Lucrecia Rivera, 42, told the newspaper in Spanish through an interpreter.

She sobbed as she recalled how the little boy cried before he was dropped off at the center Wednesday morning and told her that he did not want to be left there.

'My only grandson, the light of this house,' she said. 'Where was I to save you from all these dangers? ... I would have rather died myself instead of him.'

Police have not confirmed whether the child fell from the roof or a window as the investigation is still ongoing, though all the windows were closed.

They have also not confirmed there is even a daycare in the building, though one is registered and licensed to that address.

Boston Police Superintendent in Chief William G. Gross, who was at the scene, said police arrived just before 10 a.m. and found the boy lying on the pavement behind the building. The child was immediately taken to Boston Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

A woman who lives near the Dorchester building described the horror scene Wednesday morning.

Shanitqua Steele, 23, said she was coming home from dropping her 2-year-old son off at school when she heard sirens and saw neighbors crowding around.

She saw a toddler lying face down at the base of the apartment. When emergency responders arrived, they turned him over. She said he didn't move but his eyes were open.

'I was like, "Oh, god, this is a baby, he still has a diaper on,"' she told the Globe.

The licensed day care center with a capacity of six children is run by Marisol Rondon-Ramos, according to the state Executive Office of Education's website. The woman was described as a 'very responsible person' and 'a very nice lady,' by people who know her.
