An amateur photographer was left hopping with happiness after spotting a frog that resembles the iconic Star Wars character Jabba the Hutt.

With its slimy looking skin and green and brown hue, this Australian green tree frog has a remarkable likeness to the obese crime lord from Return Of The Jedi.

The overweight amphibian seemed to embody the character in more ways than one as it snoozed and relaxed inside its tank at Stuttgart Zoo, Germany, much like the loathsome layabout, Jabba.

Separated at mirth: The two creatures even have a similar smile

German photographer Kerstin Molthagen, 46, noticed the animal while visiting the zoo to take pictures and spotted the similarities straight away.

Larger than most Australian frogs, the green tree frog can grown up to 10cm in length and live up to 16 years.

Kerstin said: 'I've seen the old Star Wars films and the frog's face looks very similar to Jabba.

'Animals are my favourite subject to photograph and I had to take a picture as soon as I saw the frog lying on the tree.'
