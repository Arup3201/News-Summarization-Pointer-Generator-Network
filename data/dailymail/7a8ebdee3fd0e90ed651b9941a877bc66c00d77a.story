From
that Zara cornflower blue dress 
to those vibrant pink jeans, everything the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to gold.

Whether it's her clothes, hair styles or eyebrow shape, sales are sent soaring by anything that women believe will bring them one step closer to emulating their future Queen.

And it seems that her loyal legion of fans are so desperate to be copy Kates that they will do whatever it takes - even if that means getting pregnant.

Since the Royal pregnancy was announced 
by St James's Palace in December, Clearblue, a firm that manufactures 
fertility and pregnancy testing kits, has seen sales of its fertility 
indicators rise by 60 per cent - its biggest rise in almost five years.

Baby boom: Ever since the Duchess of Cambridge announced her pregnancy, sales of Clearblue fertility tests have rocketed by 60 per cent

The home kits allow women to track their fertility across the month, letting them known when they are most likely to conceive.

The spike in sales has been put down to Kate and William's baby news - and the people of Britain rushing to conceive so they can have a baby at the same time.

Clearblue spokesman Hugh Ayling said: 'We’ve never seen an increase like this before.

'We
were pretty stunned when the stats came in and we wondered why it was. 
Then we worked it back and saw the spike came after Kate made her 
announcement.

'It would seem that women are trying for a baby in the hope of experiencing their pregnancy alongside Kate.

'The
nation is still obviously in the throes of Royal fever following the 
Royal wedding, Jubilee and now the announcement of a Royal Heir.

'With
so many British couples aiming to join the Duke and Duchess, another 
royal engagement could be on the cards for a host of 2013 children who 
will grow up with the future King or Queen of England.'

It is not the first time a Royal pregnancy has sparked a baby boom either.

Following Princess Diana’s 
announcement of her second pregnancy in 1984, British gynaecologist 
Harold Francis noted a similar baby boom, leading him to estimate that 
an extra 60,000 British women would become mothers-to-be around the same
date that William was born.
