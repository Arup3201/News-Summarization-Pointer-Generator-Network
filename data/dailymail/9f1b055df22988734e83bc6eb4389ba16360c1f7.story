One of Jamie Bulger's killers was rehoused to a bail hostel just a few yards from a children's play ground, it has been claimed.

Jon Venables, 31, was released from prison in August this year with a fourth new identity after being hauled back to prison in 2010 for possessing child porn.

But now it's been claimed that authorities housed
him in a bail hostel somewhere in the north of England, a short distance from a playground, to prepare him for life in the community.

The revelation provoked fury from Jamie Bulger's father.

Paroled: Jon Venables, pictured left, after his arrest for the murder of Jamie Bulger, right, in 1993 has been released to live in a bail hostel near a children's park somewhere in the north of England, it is claimed

‘Venables is a ticking time bomb just waiting to strike at children,’ Ralph Bulger told friends, according to the Sun.

‘I
can’t believe the authorities would be so stupid as to put a convicted 
pervert and child killer near a kids’ park’, he said, adding: ‘His 
history speaks for itself how warped, violent and predatory he is and he
is just let loose to pose a grave risk to youngsters again.’

The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.

Chilling: CCTV footage showed Venebles and Robert Thompson leading young James away by the hand in a Bootle shopping centre

Sadistic: Jamie Bulger was found on a railway line where he was battered to death by Venables and Thompson in 1993

Venables and friend Robert Thompson, both ten at the time, were jailed for eight years for sadistically killing toddler Jamie, two, in 1993.

The toddler was abducted from a shopping centre in Bootle and subjected to a horrific attack near a railway line that shocked the nation.

Jon Venables was first released from prison in 2001, at the age of 18, and given a new identity to protect him from the risk of vigilante attacks.

At the time, a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences.

However, he developed drinking and drugs problems, and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer.

When a probation officer visited his home in Cheshire in 2010 to discuss his fears that he could be in danger, he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer.

The hard drive was later examined by police, who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children.

Venables admitted that he had posed online as a 35-year-old woman who had abused her eight-year-old daughter, and was returned to prison.

Venables was first given a new identity when he and Thompson were sent to a young offenders' institution for murdering the toddler.

A second new identity was created for him when he was released in 2001, and he was given a third identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images.

Venables left prison in September this year with a fourth new identity, taking the total cost of his secret identities to £1million.

Bulger's relatives were only 
given a message that he had been set free days after he was released, to
protect his right to anonymity.

And
despite recommendations by an official review into how Venables was 
allowed to re-offend last time he was released, he has not been fitted 
with a new sat-nav GPS tagging bracelet.

The device would allow probation officers to remotely monitor his every move.

Former
Home Office mandarin Sir David Omand said the tag could stop him 
sneaking back to Liverpool – which he did repeatedly last time.

Under
the terms of his release, Venables has been banned from trawling sex 
sites on the internet and once again ordered to stay away from 
Merseyside.

Currently 
the GPS tracker is only available in ‘extreme’ circumstances and, to the
dismay of James’s family, Venables has not been selected by officials 
to wear the device.
