Waking up and travelling to work in the dark can make the day ahead seem unbearable.

To solve this,  one train company has come up with the world's first 'therapy carriage' - which is designed to make people less depressed about the weather.

The unique carriage was decked out with bright lights which are used to help treat people who suffer from a winter depression known as 'Seasonal Affective Disorder' (SAD).

SAD affects 500,000 people every winter between September and April, and in particular, during January and February.

And this morning's 7.06am First Great Western train from London Paddington Station to Penzance, Cornwall, was full of special SAD Lumie lights - which are designed to help treat SAD.

First Great Western collaborated with charity the Seasonal Affective Disorder Association (SADA), to see how they could brighten passenger's journeys as the winter blues take their toll.

SAD is caused by a chemical imbalance due to the shortening of daylight hours, and the lack of sunlight in winter.

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that has a seasonal pattern.

The episodes of depression tend to occur at the same time each year, usually during the winter.

As with other types of depression, the two main symptoms of SAD are a low mood and a lack of interest in life. 

Sufferers may also be less active than normal and sleep more.

Being animals, humans are all affected to some extent by changes in light and the seasons. 

Most people like comfort food and tend to feel more lethargic in winter. 

For about 20 per cent of the UK population, mildly debilitating symptoms of SAD cause discomfort but not serious suffering. 

This is called 'Sub-syndromal SAD' or 'Winter Blues'.

For about 2 per cent, SAD is a seriously disabling illness which prevents them from functioning normally without the appropriate treatment.

The SAD  lights, which were installed in the carriages, help alleviate symptoms of depression during the dark winter days.

This is because they reproduce daylight and provide bright light which it's claimed increases levels of alertness, boosts mood and improves overall day-to-day performance.

The lights offer high levels of light intensity as they each deliver 10,000 Lux - the method in which the intensity of visible light is measured - which is said to be enough bright light to get the body clock back on track.

During a bright day, the level of brightness ranges from 10,000 to 25,000 Lux.

Jamie Anderson from First Great Western said: 'With the dark winter mornings and evenings, and post-Christmas blues, the first few months of the year are traditionally a time when people look to book a summer holiday, or a long weekend away, often taking advantage of the longer daylight hours on the south coast.

'Until then, we are trying to shine a ray of light on people's journeys, and help them arrive at work and travel home again without the "winter blues".'

Jenny Scott-Thompson, from SADA, added: 'With the continual lack of light and a long, cold January after the Christmas celebrations, this time of year is the peak time people suffer symptoms of SAD.

'We are pleased First Great Western is taking this step to help alleviate passengers suffering with SAD Lumie lights on board.'

The 7.06am service runs daily to Cornwall, a region which averages over ten more hours of sunshine a month in January than the rest of the UK, according to the Met Office.

Cornwall averages 58 hours of sunshine in January, compared with an average of just 47 hours across the UK as a whole.

January and February is the peak time for SAD, which is caused by a chemical imbalance due to the shortening of daylight hours, and the lack of sunlight in winter
