With an election fast approaching, the Tories are eager to raise as much money as they can.

But the guest list for tonight’s glittering black and white fundraising ball is likely to raise eyebrows from some traditional Conservative supporters.

Sex shop queen Jacqueline Gold, her porn baron father David Gold and gentleman’ s club owner Peter Stringfellow joined the Prime Minister for the glittering event, which it was hoped would be the most lucrative dinner in modern party political history.

Hedge-fund kings, City tycoons and captains of industry were also among the 1,100 guests paying between £500 and £1,500 a ticket for the bash at London’s Grosvenor House Hotel.

They sat at tables alongside Mr Cameron, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Party Chairman Grant Shapps.

The dress code for the lavish event was ‘Winter Cool’, with Mr Cameron opting for a lounge suit, rather than black tie, and his wife Samantha, wearing a knee-length cream dress.

Zoe Purvis, a celebrity makeup artist, chaired the dinner's organising committee.

One top table was taken by her multi-millionaire husband Andrew Law, chief executive of Caxton Associates, which uses its £4.5billion hedge fund to bet on international currency movements.

Other guests included Nancy Dell’Olio, who wore eye-catching leopard print shoes, and was accompanied by millionaire businessman Ivan Massow, who is hoping to become the party’s 2016 London mayoral candidate.

Miss Gold is most well-known for bringing the Rampant Rabbit to Britain after transforming her father David’s business Ann Summers.

They were joined at the party by Apprentice star Karren Brady, who became a Tory peer last year, despite her history working for Mr Gold’s sex-obsessed Sport Newspapers.

Also attending was David Sullivan, who made his fortune from porn films, adult magazines and sex shops. 

Party chiefs were hoping to raise up to £3 million from the soiree to help boost their war chest for the general election.

Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘It's no wonder the Tories stand up for a privileged few when their election campaign relies on such an elite few funders.

‘Ministers are busy rubbing shoulders with an exclusive network of big money backers rather than delivering for working people.

'As Ministers and tycoons gather tonight to decide how the Tory campaign is going to be funded, families up and down the country are suffering a cost of living crisis to which the Tories have no answers.’
