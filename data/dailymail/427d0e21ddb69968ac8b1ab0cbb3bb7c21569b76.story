The newlywed accused of pushing her husband off a cliff in Glacier National Park has been put under house arrest as she awaits trial.

A federal judge said 22-year-old Jordan Linn Graham, who had first claimed her husband had gone hiking with friends, posed no risk to the community.

Her release comes a day after Montana prosecutors revealed that an email was allegedly sent from a man named 'Tony' while Graham's husband was still missing, saying he had died in a fall.

The email, sent three days after Cody Lee Johnson went missing, claimed he had fallen and died after going 
hiking with three friends.

According to the affidavit, the message also suggested 'the search should be called off', according to the Missoulian.

However,
the email was traced to a computer belonging to Graham's stepfather Steven Rutledge, and it 
found to have been written on the day the gmail account it was sent from was 
created, FBI 
Special Agent Steven Liss said.

Graham
allegedly later admitted to police that she pushed her husband during an 
argument, causing him to fall to his death.

She appeared in Missoula court 
on Wednesday as a judge decided whether she should be kept in custody 
until her trial.

Her 
25-year-old husband died on July 7 and Graham allegedly confessed to 
pushing him on July 16, but she wasn't arrested on second-degree murder 
charges until Monday.

When
she interviewed by the police on July 18, Graham admitted that she had 
lied about the death of her husband and provided false statements, 
according to ABC News.

Under
the conditions for her house arrest Graham must live at her parents 
home in Kalispell, undergo a mental health evaluation and submit to radio frequency monitoring.

According
to charging documents Graham had been having second thoughts about 
getting married around the time the body of her husband was discovered.

Graham
has told an FBI agent that she and her husband had been arguing on July
7 as they walked in the Loop Trail area of the park.

At one point, she turned to walk away, but Johnson grabbed her arm, she said. She turned around, removed his hand from her arm and 'due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back, and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,' an affidavit states.

Johnson was reported missing on July 8 when he failed to show up for work. Graham later reported that she had spotted his body.

Graham initially told investigators that Johnson left their house late on July 7 with unidentified friends in a dark-colored car with Washington state license plates.

Family friend Tracey Maness told the Missoulian that Johnson was excited about his wedding and in love with Graham

That night she texted a friend and said 
she was about to talk to Johnson about her reservations about having 
gotten married the previous weekend.

The friend, identified only by initials, told the FBI about receiving the text from Graham just before 9pm in which Graham said, 'Oh well, I'm going to talk to him.'

The friend responded, 'I'll pray for you guys.'

Graham replied, 'But dead serious if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened.'

Another friend said Graham reported receiving an email on July 10 saying Johnson had left with three friends, went hiking, had fallen and was dead.

The next day, Graham reported to park officials that she had spotted Johnson's body. A ranger thought that was unusual, but Graham explained, 'It was a place he wanted to see before he died,' authorities said.

Shortly after he died, Graham posted a photo on Instagram from their wedding day.

As a caption she wrote, 'Miss you so much Cody! Not a day will go by where I don't think about you!! You will live on in my heart forever!! I know you're in a better place now looking down on me!! You're my angel!! Love you with all my heart and soul!! See you again one day!!!'

Family friend Tracey Maness told the Missoulian Johnson was excited about his wedding and in love with Graham.

According
to Graham's social media accounts, the couple got engaged in December 
2012. She tweeted a photo of the ring and wrote, 'He proposed!! Best 
early Christmas present ever!!'
