For Banksy's penultimate piece of his month-long takeover of New York's streets he headed over to Yankee Stadium where he stenciled this wildcat. 

The work, called Bronx Zoo, is located across the street from the baseball stadium at East 162nd Street and Jermome Avenue. 

The cat seems to have graffiti tags instead of spots and sits on a yellow line of paint.

Gothamist pointed out that the work's name may refer to the fact that Yankees earned the name Bronx Zoo between 1972 and 1981 because of the fighting between George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and Reggie Jackson. 

Yesterday, the artist appeared to be trying to win over the Big Apple by helping to raise money for a local charity with a piece.

The elusive artist took a painting from a charity shop and added a seated Nazi officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six-figure sum.

He took his cues from The Thomas Crown Affair remake as he purchased a painting from the Housing Works shop on 23rd Street before adding his own spin to the work and donating it back to the same store.

Fans have been gathering for a month to capture the pieces of artwork by the British artist which have been cropping up over New York

The original landscape picture showed sun breaking through clouds above an unspecified mountain range by a river in the woods.

Banksy then added a Nazi officer with his back facing the viewer, sitting on a bench looking at the scene.

As verification, the artist posted a picture of the work to his website where he chronicles his daily contribution to New York's art scene.

He titled the work 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil' on his website.

He also added his signature beneath that of the original artist, K. Sager.

A spokesperson from Housing Works has confirmed the sale and said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the painting.

The charity, which is dedicated to helping end homelessness and those living with HIV/Aids, received a call confirming the Banksy connection on Tuesday.

It is being sold via an online charity aution website. It was initially listed Tuesday evening with a starting price of $76,000 according to The Village Voice.

As of 11pm local time, it was already up to $201,200.

Drawing a crowd: Throughout the day on Tuesday, spectators began to realize that the picture hanging in the charity shop window was actually made by the famed graffiti artist

The painting is being monitored by security and displayed in the window of the 23rd Street branch until online bidding stops at 8pm on Thursday October 31.

the British artist's self-imposed 'residency' in New York, where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month.

One exception was made on October 23 when he posted on his website that the day's art had 'been cancelled due to police activity'.

Protecting the goods: A security guard will be posted in front of the painting until an online auction is completed on Thursday evening. The price is already up to six-figures

His new philanthropic turn comes after he penned an op-ed slamming the 'Freedom Tower' design that is being built as a replacement for the World Trade Center.

His critique- where he called the building a 'shyscrapper'- landed him in hot water, but he is now earning back goodwill by helping out one of the city's most popular charities.

'It’s such a great gesture, what he did today is really special. He may be controversial,  but there is no controversy in the fact that it goes to something good,' Ms Edmondson told The Post.

'This is one of the coolest things that has happened to us in a long time.'
