An earlier species of the bees died out with the dinosaurs when many flowering plants were also wiped out, scientists said.

Despite the lack of fossilised evidence, researchers were able to prove for the first time that carpenter bees underwent mass extinction 65 million years ago as part of an analysis of DNA in modern bees.

The findings could help scientists shed light on the current decline in bee species across the globe that threatens the world’s crop reliant on bees for pollination.

American and Australian scientists teamed up to model a mass extinction in bee group Xylocopinae, or carpenter bees, at the end of the Cretaceous and beginning of the Paleogene eras, known as the K-T boundary.

Previous studies have suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants at the K-T boundary and it has long been assumed that the bees who depended upon those plants would have met the same fate.

Yet unlike the dinosaurs 'there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees' making the confirmation of such an extinction difficult.

Using a technique called molecular phylogenetics, the scientists analysed the DNA sequences of four 'tribes' of 230 species of carpenter bees from every continent except Antarctica for insight into evolutionary relationships.

It is thought that bees searched for nectar from ancient flowers, illustrated alongside Leptoceratops

In the study published in journal PLOS ONE, they began to see patterns consistent with a mass extinction.

Combining fossil records with the DNA analysis, the researchers could introduce time into the equation, learning not only how the bees are related but also how old they are.

Sandra Rehan, assistant professor of biological sciences at University of New Hampshire, said: 'The data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time.

'And it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct.'

While much of Professor Rehan’s work involved behavioural observation of bees native to the northeast of North America, the research taps the computer-heavy bioinformatics side of her expertise; assembling genomic data to explain similarities and differences among the various species over time.

Marrying observations from the field with genomic data, she believes, paints a fuller picture of these bees’ behaviours over time.

She said: 'If you could tell their whole story, maybe people would care more about protecting them.

'Indeed, the findings of this study have important implications for today’s concern about the loss in diversity of bees - a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity.

'Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today.'
