Daniel Sturridge has always been deemed a fairly cool sort of chap, hasn't he?

Well it turns out we were all wrong, and the England international posted the picture on social media to prove it.

The Liverpool striker, famed for his perfect fades and crazy celebration, lost all street cred when he posted a picture of himself with Louis Tomlinson.

One Direction's Louis Tomlinson had a brief spell playing for Doncaster Rovers and tried to buy the club

Tomlinson is in the band One Direction by the way, just in case you are anything other than a 12-year-old girl.

He also had a brief spell with Doncaster Rovers as a player, he also tried to buy the club, and in his tweet Sturridge joked that both would be strike partners in the summer.

It appeared the duo were out in London's swanky Libertine club as Sturridge continues to show the world he has lots of friends in music.

The 25-year-old striker is also believed to be pals with rappers Drake and Tinie Tempah with the latter supporting the band The Script just last week at the Echo arena.

The duo enjoyed 'tea and toast' at Liverpool's Leaf Cafe on Bold Street on that occasion.
