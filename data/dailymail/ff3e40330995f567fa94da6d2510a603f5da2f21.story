As they struggled for their next breath and were pulled under the stream of Dublin's Grand Canal, it looked as if their days were numbered.

But these resilient puppies- who are less than four weeks old- were rescued by a man who jumped into the river and brought them to dry land.

The ten pups were found in Clondalkin- a town to the west of Dublin.They were pulled from the water and passed to onlookers by the man who wishes to remain anonymous.

Heartbreaking: These adorable puppies are four of the ten who were thrown into Dublin's Grand Canal and were lucky to survive the ordeal

Recovering: The lucky litter was pulled from the water by a courageous passer-by who went on to look after them for a night

Getting some shuteye: The tiny pups, who are between three and four weeks old, were tired but healthy when they were given to the DSPCA

They are thought to be retriever cross, possibly mixed with mastiff.

Nine of the puppies survived the ordeal, and their rescuer cared for them for a night before bringing them to DSPCA (Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals).

Gillian Bird of the DSPCA said: 'A man was walking past the canal when he saw the white shapes bobbing around in the water.

'He immediately jumped in when he 
realised what they were and was shouting for passers-by to catch the 
pups as he threw them up to the bank.

'There were ten pups; unfortunately one died and the other one has been kept by the brave man's family.

Sweet dreams: The puppies were given a cuddly toy, which helps them get to sleep

Puppy pile-up: The pups have been sent out in pairs to four separate foster homes

'When they were bought in they were tired, but after some food they were fine and were happy dozing.

'As they are so young we gave them a 
cuddly toy. They appreciate something to snuggle up against as a comfort
or they just end up suckling on each other's paws.

'It was really a selfless act by the 
man, but I fear for the mental state of whoever threw the puppies into 
the water.

'If anyone ever has any concerns about caring for animals all 
they need to do is call us for advice.'

'They have already gone out in pairs to four separate foster families, each with their own cuddly toy.

'They will get vaccinations at eight or nine weeks before being put up for adoption.'
