Mats Hummels denied speculation he will move to Manchester United this summer after scoring in Germany's 4-0 thumping of Portugal at the World Cup.

The Borussia Dortmund centre-half has been linked with a move to Old Trafford to join Louis Van Gaal's revolution at the deposed Barclays Premier League champions.

Hummels scored the second goal, heading a Toni Kroos corner past Portugal goalkeeper Patricio, as Germany sent out a strong statement of intent in Salvador.

Asked afterwards about a possible move to United, the 25-year-old said: 'I never think about that or talk about that because it is something that isn't important for me right now.

'Maybe it will be someday, but I don't expect it to be link that this summer.'

Hummels went down late on with a knee injury but is confident he will be fit for Germany's second group game against Ghana on Saturday night.

'It's not a problem. It will take a bit of ice, but it is ok,' he said.

'I just had a cramp in my calf before I did it, but I hope it is just a bruise that will be ok in 2-3 days.'

Thomas Muller started his campaign to retain the Golden Boot in style with a hat-trick but Hummels' header came at a crucial time.

He said: 'Yes, it was very important for us. It is very nice to score in a World Cup because it is something you dream of as a child. It was a great moment for me.

'It can be very big for us because we know what we can do if we play like we did today.

'if we are concentrated and focused, both defensively and offensively, then we are a good team and that is the way we play.

'If we can do that in every game, we are going to have a good chance to be very successful.'

Brazil and Argentina remain the fancied teams to lift the World Cup on July 13, but Germany laid down a marker with their dominant display.

Asked whether they can become the first European team to win the tournament in South America, Hummels said: 'Yes, the thing is to work as a team.

'If we work defensively as we should, then our attacking play is so good that we have a chance to beat every team. That is for sure.

'But the same counts for Spain, Brazil and the Netherlands, so it will be very tough to win this tournament.

'We have to be very good to win the World Cup, winning five or six games, and if you have one bad day, then the World Cup is over.'
