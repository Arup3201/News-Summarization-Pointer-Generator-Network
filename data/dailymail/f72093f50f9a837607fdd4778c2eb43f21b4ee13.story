A Malaysian family on Friday sued the government and beleaguered national carrier for negligence in the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370, in what is believed to be the first lawsuit filed over the disaster.

It was filed by lawyers on behalf of the two underage sons of Jee Jing Hang - Jee Kinson, 13, and Jee Kinland, 11 - who was on board the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight.

Gary Chong, one of the lawyers for Mr Jee's relatives, said the suit was filed in a Malaysian court on Friday.

The family is suing Malaysia Airlines for breach of contract, saying the carrier failed in its contractual responsibility to deliver Mr Jee to his destination.

The family is also suing Malaysia's government, civil aviation authorities, immigration department and air force for negligence.

The boys are seeking damages for mental distress, emotional pain and the loss of support following the disappearance of their father. He operated an Internet business earning monthly income of nearly 17,000 ringgit (£3,200).

'We have waited for eight months. After speaking to various experts, we believe we have sufficient evidence for a strong case. A big plane missing in this age of technology is really unacceptable,' Arunan Selvaraj, another of the boys' lawyers, said.

Chong said the family would seek damages but declined to specify a figure.

MH370 inexplicably disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in what remains one of history's greatest aviation mysteries.

Malaysia's government believes the flight diverted to the far southern Indian Ocean, citing sketchy satellite data, but no trace has been found despite an extensive search.

Neither the government nor airline has revealed any results from investigations into the tragedy, and officials have consistently stressed that only the recovery of the lost Boeing 777 aircraft will provide full answers.

Some next-of-kin of missing passengers bitterly accuse the government and airline of a bungled response and cover-up, charges that are strenuously denied.

Malaysia's air force came under particular fire after top officer acknowledged military radar had tracked the red-eye flight as it doubled back over Malaysian airspace after diverting.

The air force took no action, saying the radar blip was not considered a security threat.

The chances of success for the lawsuit were not immediately clear.

Aviation experts told AFP that under international law it is an airline's responsibility to prove it was not to blame for an accident.

The lack of evidence could complicate that task for the carrier.

Steve Wang, a Chinese man whose mother was on the plane, said many Chinese families had retained lawyers but he didn't think any of them had filed a lawsuit yet.

'We are examining the laws to figure out how to best bring our cases - for example, if we should file the suits in Malaysia. But without knowing where the plane is, evidence is lacking, and there are still possibilities that things may change,' Wang said. 'For now, it looks very difficult for us to bring a suit against the Malaysian government and its military.'

The airline also has been hammered by the loss in July of flight MH17 - apparently shot down - over Ukraine with the loss of 298 lives, and is in dire financial straits as business has dried up.

A state-linked investment fund has directly taken over the airline as part of a rescue plan.

In countries such as China - home to the majority of MH370 passengers - and Malaysia, courts are considered relatively conservative regarding the awarding of damages.
