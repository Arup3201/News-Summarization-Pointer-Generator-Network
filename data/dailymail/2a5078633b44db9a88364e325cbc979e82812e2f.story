A 21-year-old student has found a way of allowing Facebook users to encode pictures with secret messages.

Owen Campbell-Moore, a computer science student at Oxford University, has created a browser extension that allows people to share secret messages on the social networking site.

Secretbook allows anyone with access to Google Chrome to hide 140 character long messages in JPEG images uploaded to Facebook and these messages can only be unlocked using a personal password.

It works by hiding messages amongst the millions of images that are uploaded to Facebook.

It does this by changing a pixel to a different colour and then replicating it in many different pictures to spell out a message.

This message is then only revealed to someone who knows the password and knows which pixel to look for.

According to Wired.com, Mr Campbell-Moore spent two months designing the programme as part of a university project.

It is the first time that anyone has managed to work out how to hide messages in computer files and it is very difficult for Facebook to detect as it operates through a Google Chrome web extension platform.

Secretbook works by hiding steganographic messages where no one would think to look – in this case, among the millions of images that are uploaded to Facebook.

Mr Campbell-Moore told Wired.com: ‘Many tools for steganography in JPEGs have existed in the past although they have always required that the images are transmitted exactly as they are.’

For example, this could be one pixel which has been changed to a different colour and then replicated in many pictures to spell out a message – to see this message you have to know the password and which pixel to look for.

However, when a picture is uploaded to Facebook the image is automatically formatted which would render any message incomprehensible.

As a result, Mr Campbell-Moore had to copy the sites recompression algorithm so that the encoded message is automatically compressed meaning that it does not change when recompressed by Facebook.

Mr Campbell-Moore accepts that the technology could be used by terrorists but he believes that they would not use his method of steganography as it is not entirely secure.

When Wired.com approached Facebook a spokesperson declined to comment on Secretbook.
