The parents of a baby boy born in Pennsylvania this week and named Waldo will have no trouble at all finding him anywhere - as he tips the scales at more than 13lbs.

Officials at Delaware County Memorial Hospital say Brian and Danielle Dwyer’s son delivered  Monday is the largest baby they can recall there.

Waldo James Mysterious Dwyer tipped the scales at 13 pounds, 8-and-a-half ounces.

Whoa baby! Brian and Danielle Dwyer welcomed their son, Waldo, who tipped the scales at record-breaking 13 pounds and 8 and a half ounces

Cheeky: Delaware County Memorial Hospital says the Dwyers' son delivered is the largest baby they can recall there

Special delivery: Waldo was welcomed into the world via C-section two weeks after Danielle Dwyer's original due date, giving him extra time to beef up

The quirky couple explained that they loved the 'Where’s Waldo?' books as children, so that’s where they got their son’s unusual first name.

Dwyer said 
the middle name Mysterious is because Waldo was born under a blood red 
lunar eclipse on April 14, 2014 — a date that reads the same forward and
 backward.

Illusive namesake: The couple were inspired to give their son the name Waldo because they both loved the 'Where's Waldo?' books as children

‘If there is one child who could own that name Waldo James Mysterious, I think that it's him,’ Brian told the station WPVI. 

The Dwyers live in the Fishtown section of Philadelphia. New dad Brian is a co-owner of Pizza Brain, a popular pizza shop and likely the world's first ever pizza museum.

Danielle Dwyer, originally from California, works at The Random Team Room & Curiosity Shop.

The couple's hefty bundle of joy was delivered via C-section two weeks after Danielle Dwyer's original due date, reported the Delaware County Daily Times.

The parents had been expecting a baby weighing 9-10lbs, but as his mother put it, Waldo had a little extra time to 'cook.'

‘When
 he came out, when the doctor pulled him out, on his shoulders, there 
were so many fat rolls you couldn't tell where his armpits were,’ said 
Mr Dwyer.

Danielle Dwyer's doctor later told her Waldo was the biggest baby he has ever delivered.

Surprise! Danielle Dwyer, 31, had expected her son to be big, but she had no idea that he would turn out to be the largest baby ever delivered at Delaware County Memorial Hospital

Quikry couple: Brian Dwyer, 29, and wife Danielle, 29, live in Fishtown, Pennsylvania, where the husband operates a popular local pizzeria and pizza museum

He's a character: Mr Dwyer, 29, predicted that his son will be nicknamed 'Dough Boy' or 'Prince of Pizza'

This is a first baby for Brian, 29, and Danielle, 31. The mother described their new 13-pound, 22-inches-long addition as peaceful and strong.

Her husband predicted that besides the obvious ‘Wally,’ some of his son's nicknames will include 'Dough Boy' and ‘Prince of Pizza.’
