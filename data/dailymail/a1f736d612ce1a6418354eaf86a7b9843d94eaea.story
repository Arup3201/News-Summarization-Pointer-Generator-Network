A former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader and the estranged wife of a prominent Maryland energy executive has been arrested and charged in connection with a sexual relationship involving a 15-year-old boy.

Molly Shattuck, 47, was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors, Delaware State Police Sgt. Paul Shavack said. 

She was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday in Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware.

Molly Shattuck, 47, was indicted on Monday on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors

Mother-of-three Shattuck met her victim on Instagram in May and passed on her phone number, according to court affidavits  seen by WBALTV.

The pair started talking and eventually met in Columbia after she picked him up and drove him to a middle school parking lot. 

According to the documents, Shattuck and the boy met 'almost a half-dozen times' during July.

But the relationship ended over the Labor Day weekend, Schavack said. 

Shattuck and her children, plus her kids' friends were staying in a rented beach house in Bethany Beach when the boy stayed over one night.

'Sometime around 2 a.m. Sunday morning, they drove to a liquor store and (Molly) Shattuck purchased a 12-pack of Miller Lite and a 12-pack of Bud Light for them,' state the court documents.

Once back at the house, Shattuck is alleged to have performed oral sex on the boy at least twice - first outside the home while walking the dog and then again in her bedroom. 

The documents state '(the boy) described the undergarments (Molly) Shattuck was wearing when he entered her bedroom.'

The documents say she allegedly  told the boy 'if he wanted to have sex she would. The boy opted out. He decided to leave. At that point, she told him to come back later but he did not go back.'

The next day the boy's father collected him. 

On September 26, the boy's family reported the incident to the police who executed a search warrant at Molly Shattuck's $2.5 million home on October 1.

Investigators were looking for, among other things, Shattuck's cellphone and pink underwear.

Sgt. Paul Shavack refused to confirm which items had been removed as possible evidence.

The headmaster at the boy’s school have since banned Shattuck from entering the campus

In an email sent to the campus community, McDonogh School Headmaster Charles Britton sent an e-mail to the campus community said additional security measures have been put in place. 

Shattuck is separated from Mayo Shattuck, 60, the former CEO of Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Nuclear Group and the current chairman of Chicago-based Exelon Corp., also an energy provider. 

Exelon, which has electric and gas utilities in Maryland, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, now owns Constellation.

In 2005, Molly Shattuck, a Baltimore native, became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad on her first tryout. She cheered for two years and was a part-time coach for six more years.

Shattuck also is a fitness consultant and advocate, and published a book in February called Vibrant Living.

Her website, which is in 'maintenance mode' on Wednesday morning, says she has implemented a 21-day plan for health and improved living with people, companies and groups across the U.S. for the past several years.

A cached version of her biography on the site says she is an ambassador for the American Diabetes Association and works with the American Heart Association and United Way of Central Maryland's Access to Healthy Food Initiative. 

She's a trustee of the United Way of Central Maryland, and a member of boards for the Baltimore School for the Arts, the Johns Hopkins Children's Center and the National Children's Museum.

In 2008, Shattuck appeared on an episode of the ABC-TV reality show Secret Millionaire and gave away $190,000 to people helping the poor.

Her website says she has three children, including a 15-year-old son.

According to online Maryland court records, Molly and Mayo Shattuck filed for divorce September 29 in Baltimore County. 

The Baltimore Sun reported in March that the couple had separated, although Molly Shattuck demurred to the newspaper about when the breakup occurred, saying, 'It's been awhile.'
