A 50-year-old man has committed suicide by shooting himself in the head during a gun safety class at a shooting range.

Brian J. Parry used a pistol to kill himself in front of more than a dozen people including children on Sunday at West Coast Armory in Bellevue, Washington.

Bellevue police are investigating the man's death, which was ruled a suicide by the King County Medical Examiner's Office earlier this week.

According to West Coast's website, the gun range offered an entry-level handgun course the day of the shooting.

Participants paid $75 for three hours of instruction meant to teach students how to load and use pistols and revolvers. As part of the class, students are supplied firearms in various calibers and ammunition to practice with, according to the Bellevue Patch.

A police spokesman said the shooting appeared to be planned and no one else was injured.

A witness told the Patch that Parry shot himself in front of all the other participants during the practice portion of the class at the range, when participants were handling the firearms.

He told the news service that the man had appeared lonely and 'deflated' before the shooting and had avoided talking to fellow class members and asking questions of the instructor.

The unnamed witness said he thought there was nothing the teacher could have done to save the man.

'Anytime someone is standing there with a gun pointed at his head, there's nothing anyone could have done to stop him from shooting himself,' the man said.
