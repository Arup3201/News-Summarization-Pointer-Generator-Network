Getting rid of bad smells in a bathroom can be a tricky business, with some opting to install a fan or use candles and sprays.

But a new invention claims to be able to more quickly remove odours so that the toilet stays smelling clean and fresh.

Called Fresh Air Plus, this odour-eliminating toilet seat aims to eliminate unsavoury smells by pumping them outside.

An inventor in Tennessee has revealed his odour-eliminating toilet seat. Called Fresh Air Plus (shown) the device has a built-in fan to get rid of bad smells. When a person sits on it a sensor triggers a fan inside the bowl, which filters any unpleasant odours away

First, you'll need to remove your old toilet seat by undoing its screws.

Then, after removing your current seat and the screws that hold it on, simply place the Fresh Air Plus on your toilet.

The seat is ready to go as soon as you plug it in the nearest outlet.

The last part is running the hose to the outside. To do this, you need to drill a hole in the wall behind the toilet with a drill bit and widen it with a wood eater bit.

Then pass the Fresh Air Hose through the silver finish and stick it into the hole.

You will need to repeat the same hole on the outside of the house to run the hose all the way to the outdoors.

Fresh Air Plus was invented by Adam Payz from Nashville, Tennessee and is currently seeking £50,000 ($80,000) of funding on Kickstarter.

The detachable seat can be placed on top of existing toilets when the old seat is removed.

When a person sits on it a sensor triggers a fan inside the bowl, which filters any unpleasant odours away. 

The odours are taken through a hose away from the toilet and outside the house.

To power the fan the seat needs to be plugged into a wall socket. 

One issue for potential owners, though, might be that a ventilation hole needs to be drilled in the side of the house to feed the hose outside.

For people with houses made of something stronger than wood, this may be somewhat of a problem.

But the company claims their solution is the best way to avoid embarrassing smells lurking in bathrooms.

‘Traditional ceiling odour-removal fans are an inefficient solution because they allow odours to permeate into the room before removing,’ the company writes

‘They also suck out heated and cooled air, causing you to lose money on your utilities.

‘Air fresheners are just a mask for odours, and often make what you’ve done in the restroom even more obvious.

‘Fresh Air Plus makes having people over (even that special someone) worry-free.’

The detachable seat is easily installed in place of existing seats. They claim it gets rid of smells better than other fans, sprays or candles. This can make using the bathroom more pleasant for the next person to walk in. It is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter to launch in March 2015
