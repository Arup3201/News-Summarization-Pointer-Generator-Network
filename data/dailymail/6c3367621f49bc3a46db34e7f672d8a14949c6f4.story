A teenage girl has launched a petition for Disney to make a plus-size princess in the wake of controversy over whether the company promotes an unrealistic feminine ideal.

Jewel Moore, a high school junior from Farmville, Virginia, wrote on her Change.org page that since Disney has such a huge influence on young girls, it should create a princess with a curvy body to 'show support to a group of girls who are otherwise horrendously bullied by the media.'

But while many have praised her for trying to put a stop to body shaming, others have questioned whether a 'plus-size' princess - rather than simply a normal-size one - is a step in the wrong direction.

Fighting for a cause: Jewel Moore, a high school junior from Farmville, Virginia, who describes herself as 'plus-size', has launched a Change.org petition for Disney to create a plus-size princess

Body image: Citing the unrealistically skinny proportions of princesses like Ariel (left) and Jasmine (right), she says Disney should 'show support to a group of girls who are otherwise horrendously bullied by the media'

Jewel's petition, which has amassed 861 signatures so far, bears the title: 'Every body is beautiful'.

She writes that she created the page 'because I'm a plus-size young woman, and I know many plus-size girls and women who struggle with confidence and need a positive plus-size character in the media.'

Citing research that 'a child's confidence correlates greatly with how much representation they have in the media,' she says a plus-size Disney princess would be a positive step towards body acceptance.

Many commenters have agreed with Jewel, leaving comments on the Change.org page to express their opinion.

'If young girls see that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, they can change how society views it,' wrote one supporter

Another said: 'Having dealt with being overweight my entire life, I think that it would be great for Disney to make a more realistic princess for young girls to look up to.'

But some have taken issue with Jewel's emphasis on 'plus-size', asserting that the focus needs to be on having 'normal' princesses with realistic and healthy dimensions instead.

Misguided? While many have supported her petition, some have taken issue with her emphasis on 'plus-size', saying the focus needs to be on having 'normal' princesses with realistic and healthy dimensions instead

One parent wrote on CafeMom.com: 'Why do princesses have to be either weirdly skinny or plus size? Are there any petitions for normal sized princesses?'

'If girls are THAT impressionable I wouldn't want them looking up to overweight princesses'

The sentiment was shared by another mother, who said: 'Understandable. But at the same time do we want our daughters idolizing a plus sized princess either?

'If girls are THAT impressionable then I really wouldn't want them looking up to overweight princesses or idols. Why not just average sized? Not fat, not skinny.'
