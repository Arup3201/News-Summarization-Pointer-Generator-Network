A NSW coastal town was left covered in a blanket of white after a freak hail storm transformed the area into a winter wonderland.

Forster, on the mid north coast of NSW, was hit with mass amounts of hail at 3pm on Saturday.

Streets of the beachside town were covered in 10-15cm of ice as the severe storm cell passed through leaving hail the size of golf balls.

Forecasters had predicted the chance of thunderstorms and the area had already seen 13mm of rain at 3pm, according to Bureau of Meteorology data.

Authorities had to evacuate more than 240 people from the Stockland Shopping Centre due to flooding and the partial roof collapse of a Kmart store.

But despite the destruction, children were captured enjoying the rare blanket of ice.

Jasmyne Ussia, Tileah Hooklyn and Emily Sleema made the most of the freak storm by using their boogie boards as toboggans

Some used boogie boards usually reserved for the surf as toboggans and young girls made snow angels on their front lawns.

A girl was even photographed in a snow fight wearing her netball uniform.
