Former German leader Helmut Schmidt today stunned his countrymen by revealing he cheated on his wife during their 68-year marriage.

The disclosure came when extracts of his new autobiography were printed in a German magazine. 

'I had a relationship with another woman,' said Schmidt, who lost his wife Loki five years ago.

Schmidt, 96, revealed his deepest personal secret in his book What I Still Want To Say, which is being serialised by the magazine Stern. 

He would not reveal the identity of his mistress nor how long the affair lasted. 

Former German Chancellor Helmut Schimdt  has admitted to having an affair during his 68-year marriage to Loki (pictured, above, with her husband in 2009) sometime in the late 60s or early 70s

'It was at the end of the 60s or the beginning of the 70s,' he said, adding that his wife found out about it.

He said she realised how 'close' it was and offered to leave him. 

'I told her that was a totally fallacious idea,' he added.

According to Stern, the woman was a colleague in the social democrat party which he led.

He remained in contact with her 'for a long while' after the break up and attended her funeral two years ago.

Following the death of his wife, he began a relationship with Ruth Loah, 81, his long-time secretary and they are still together.

'Ruth saved my life,' said Schmidt, who was chancellor of Germany from 1974 until 1982.

During his time as West Germany's chancellor he lead the country through Cold War tensions and a bloody wave of terror by far-left radicals, the Red Army Faction.  

He won the Iron Cross for his services in WWII which included action on both the eastern and western fronts. 

Last year, he revealed he had stashed 38,000 menthol cigarettes in his home because of fears the EU would try to ban them.

He is well known for being excused for smoking in places where it is banned.

Der Spiegel reported that the 40-a-day smoker has in the past managed to get away with it both in television studios and congress halls.
