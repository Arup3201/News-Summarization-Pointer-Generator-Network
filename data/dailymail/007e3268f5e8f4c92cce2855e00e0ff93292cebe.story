Federal Attorney-General George Brandis did not get the the reaction he was hoping for at an awards ceremony in Sydney on Wednesday evening when he was heckled by former Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks.

Senator Brandis was the keynote speaker at a Human Rights Awards function in Sydney's CBD. But just as he was finishing his address Hicks shouted: 'Hey, my name is David Hicks! I was tortured for five-and-a-half years in Guantanamo Bay in the full knowledge of your party! What do you have to say?'

As it turned out, Senator Brandis had nothing to say. But as he walked off the stage at the Museum of Contemporary Arts, Mr Hicks told reporters he was a 'coward' for not answering his question.

'He's run away,' he said. 'It's too late – he's gone.'

The incident was a blot on the night for Senator Brandis who had earlier made some important announcements in his address.

Previously in his speech he said that all asylum seeker children would be released from Christmas Island by early 2015.

'Between now and Christmas, in other words, in the next two to three weeks, all of the children in detention on Christmas Island will be released from Christmas Island and will be returned to the community as soon as possible,' he said as the packed crowd applauded.

'All the children in detention will be released by the early months of next year.'

Earlier in his speech Senator Brandis made it clear that all asylum seeker children would be released from Christmas Island by early 2015

Senator Brandis also confirmed that the government would ask the Human Rights Commission to conduct a major inquiry into employment discrimination against older Australians and people with disabilities.
