Prosecutors today vowed to appeal the 30-day sentence handed down to a high school teacher who repeatedly raped a 14-year-old student before she killed herself.

The meager sentence given by Judge G. Todd Baugh to Stacey Rambold, 54, in a Billings, Montana court last month sparked protests and an online petition calling for the judge's resignation.

'Certainly I'm disappointed in this sentence, but I have a job to do, and my job right now is to figure out if this case can be appealed because of some legal error,' Scott Twito, the county attorney told NBC on Tuesday.

Last Thursday, around 400 protesters headed to the the county courthouse to call for the resignation of the state district judge, while around 45,000 people have signed a petition demanding he resign.

Controversial: Judge G. Todd Baugh sentence has sparked outrage and will be reviewed

Organizers have endorsed Baugh's description of himself as a 'blithering idiot' for having said the victim, Cherice Moralez, acted 'older than her chronological age' and was in control of the situation.

'We will no longer stand by while individuals speak about victims in this way,' Kate Olp, the petition organizer, said.

Baugh has defended the 30-day sentence and said he did not intend to resign.

The victim's mother told Today that the sentence left her 'horrified'.

'I don't believe in justice anymore. It was a joke,' she said.

Rambold was originally charged with three felony counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008 when officials at Billings Senior High School first became aware of the sexual relationship.

Victim Cherice Moralez committed suicide 
on February 6, 2010. She shot herself in her mother’s bed just three 
weeks before her 17th birthday.

According to her mother, Auliea 
Hanlon, the pending trial of teacher Stacey Rambold - 49 when the rapes 
were committed - and trauma of the abuse were 'major factors' in her 
daughter's death.

Speaking 
to MailOnline Mrs Hanlon said that her daughter had been 'in hell,' 
shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the 
abuse.

Her death complicated the prosecution 
of former teacher Rambold, now 54.

Prosecutors who had sought to put Rambold behind bars instead settled for a three-year deferred prosecution.

According
to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this 
term if Rambold pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse 
without consent and entered a three-stage sex offender treatment 
program.

But he was kicked out of the treatment program for missing meetings and having unsupervised visits with his nieces and nephews, who are minors. In April, he pleaded guilty to a single felony count.

At his sentencing hearing last Monday, prosecutors asked the judge to put Rambold behind bars for 20 years, but Baugh said he didn't think the violations were serious enough.

In a written explanation, the judge maintained that these violations were 'not significant'.

Outrage: An estimated 400 people attended a protest rally against the sentence in Billings, Montana

Anger: Protesters have called for the judge's resignation but he has said he will not step down

He
stated: 'There were violations of the treatment program, but involved 
no violence, no inappropriate sexual conduct, and no new criminal 
activity.

'Defendant's old 
treatment provider recommended that the Defendant still be assessed as a
low risk offender and treatable in the community.

'Knowing that the Defendant had enrolled 
in another sexual offender treatment program, the Court is faced with 
deciding if the Defendant should go to prison for relatively minor 
infractions.'

After Rambold's 30 days in jail, he will be on probation for 15 years and he must register as a sex offender.

Speaking to MailOnline Cherry’s mother
said: ‘Rambold took away everything beautiful in my life and he just 
gets to walk away. He confessed. He did it.

‘With this sentence the judge just lets everyone off – he lets the school off and he lets him off.’
