Tragedy: Gauravdeep Bassi, seven months, died in November last year after choking on a pistachio shell

His mother Rajwinder Kaur, 37, told the inquest that her son was on the floor when she suddenly noticed he was struggling to breathe and phoned for an ambulance.

Paramedics arrived and unsuccessfully tried to find what was causing the obstruction in the little boy's windpipe.

He was then rushed to hospital, and the nut shell was eventually removed, but Gauravdeep was pronounced dead just one hour after his mother had called an ambulance.

Black Country Coroner Zafar Siddique said the baby's death was 'no-one's fault' at an inquest at Smethwick Coroners Court on Monday.

He said: 'My conclusion was this was an accident. It was clear he picked up a pistachio shell and swallowed it and it has become lodged. This was no-one's fault.'

Scene: The incident, ruled an accidental death, took place at the family home in Hill Top, West Midlands

Gauravdeep's mum Rajwinder, told the inquest how she witnessed her son struggling to at their home.

She said: 'I was cleaning away toys at the time and I do not know when the baby got down on the floor.

'No-one saw him pick up the shell. I heard his breathing and knew something was wrong.

'I did not know it was a nut shell, I just knew he had put something in his mouth. I called for an ambulance.

'When they arrived they checked his breathing and his neck and took him straight away.'

Paramedic Amy Gilsenan said the baby was unconscious when she arrived at the house a colleague. 

Every parent's nightmare: Gauravdeep arrived at Sandwell General Hospital just 12 minutes after his mother called for an ambulance, but his life could not be saved

She said: 'I noticed there was some resistance (in giving oxygen). The obstruction was down in the airway, but nothing was visible to remove.'

Gauravdeep was then rushed to Sandwell General Hospital, arriving at 4.30pm, 12 minutes after his mother called for an ambulance.

Consultant Mohamed Wani said a check on the baby's wind pipe found the nut shell, but a first attempt to remove the shell was unsuccessful.

An intensive care unit consultant was called and the shell was removed at 4.50pm but he was pronounced dead at 5.13pm.

Dr Wani said once the brain lost oxygen supply for more than ten minutes it was 'impossible' to survive, adding: 'There was nothing which could be done.'

Pathologist Tamas Mouton said the baby's death was caused by the blockage to his airway.
