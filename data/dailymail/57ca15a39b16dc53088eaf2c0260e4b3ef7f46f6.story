England may be forced to make another emergency change to their pack against New Zealand if lock Dave Attwood is called away for the birth of his first child.

The 27-year-old’s fiancee, Bridget, is pregnant and the baby is past due. The national coaches are on standby to make alternative arrangements if Attwood has to rush away at short notice.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘Dave’s baby is still due soon. We’ll have to have a Plan B.’

England lock Dave Attwood (C) may be forced to miss the game against All Blacks if his baby is born

England coach Stuart Lancaster has an alternative plan, despite injuries decimating his squad

That would involve a starting place for one of the two uncapped locks in the squad — George Kruis and Graham Kitchener.

Asked if Attwood had assured the management he would be available to face the All Blacks come what may, Lancaster added: ‘I don’t think he can assure me when the baby is going to be due!

A decision on whether Attwood will play will be made closer to the game on Saturday 8 November

Either newcomers Graham Kitchener (L) or George Kruis is in line to take Attwood's position  

‘The due date was actually last Friday, so we’ll see…

‘Obviously you want to be sensible. You want to put the family first but equally I know Dave’s keen to play. We’ll just have to see how nature takes its course.

‘We had the situation with Joe Marler in Italy (last season). Joe’s partner went into labour before we flew so we made the decision to leave him at home. We’ll have to react closer to the game.’
