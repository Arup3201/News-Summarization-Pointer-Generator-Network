'Enjoyed the attention': Helen Turnbull (pictured today outside court) admits kissing the 16-year-old boy during a brief affair as her marriage crumbled

A teaching assistant shared a passionate kiss with a 16-year-old boy in her Mini, a court heard yesterday.

Helen Turnbull, 35, later told the pupil: ‘It was awesome – a proper turn-on. It made me shake.’

But she denied having sex with him during daytime liaisons in her car and said she lived in fear of her husband’s response if she was unfaithful.

Turnbull – who allegedly groomed the boy with sweets and cuddles from the age of 12 – told a jury she was seduced by flirtatious messages from him during a low point in her marriage.

He sent her messages on Facebook complimenting her figure and dress sense before she responded with images of herself wearing only underwear.

Despite realising the developing relationship was ‘wrong’, the mother-of-two said she succumbed to the pupil’s advances when she shared the kiss with him in her Mini.

Turnbull described the moment in a subsequent message to him as ‘explosive’, the court heard.

She told the boy they looked ‘power’ when kissing, adding: ‘I checked us out in the car mirror.’

But when the schoolboy made it clear he was interested in having sex with her, she told him: ‘I am not like that.’

The victim was allegedly groomed by Turnbull at his Roman Catholic secondary school in Durham. In provocative messages, she allegedly asked him for ‘power sex’. 

Turnbull, wearing a plum-coloured suit, grey top, grey tights and grey shoes, admitted sending intimate messages when her children were in bed.

She said she enjoyed the attention from the pupil, who is now 18.

She told Teesside Crown Court: ‘There was no intention ever to act on the messages but it was what he wanted.

‘I wish now I had not sent them. It was just sexual chat, being able to flirt with somebody. I enjoyed getting the attention, especially when I was on my own. The children were in bed – it was the instancy of getting a message back and not feeling on my own.

‘The next day I would say it wasn’t right and try to end it.’

The tearful literary assistant denied that the relationship had developed into a sexual one, telling the court: ‘I have never had sex with him.’

‘I have never done anything sexual other than kiss him. I have said this from the very beginning, it just has not happened.’

The court heard how her marriage broke down when her affair with the teenager came to light. Turnbull, from Haswell, County Durham, explained how her relationship with the boy developed in June and July last year during a study break at the end of the summer term.

In a series of messages online, her conversation with him became increasingly flirtatious, with him writing: ‘I miss you so much.’

‘He paid me little compliments about my clothes and about my physical appearance,’ she said.

‘I didn’t expect anything to happen. I tried to stop it and I would say for him to find someone his own age.’

She began to cry before continuing: ‘In terms of my job I knew it was wrong. I tried to stop it but sometimes I felt lonely and felt unhappy.

‘I just felt so low and it was nice to have someone to get a reply from and to go back and forth.’

Earlier, the court heard how the teaching assistant had changed her Facebook profile picture from one of her three-year-old daughter to an image of her ‘cuddling’ the boy during a drunken night at the school prom.

Her husband also told the court he became suspicious after seeing a comment beside the picture in which she asked the boy whether she should wear an ‘itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini’ on a school outing.

Turnbull denies three charges of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust, but has admitted a fourth, relating to kissing.

The trial continues.
