The New Jersey couple whose slain daughter became the namesake of a sex offender registry law have spoken about their lives since and advocacy work.

Parents Maureen and Richard Kanka gave an exclusive interview to The New York Daily News almost twenty years to the day after their daughter Megan was raped and killed in July 1994.

Megan Kanka was 7 years old at the time, the paper said.

Victim: Megan Kanka was raped and murdered by neighbor Jesse Timmendequas in 1994

The Kankas told the paper they sprang to action after they learned neighbor and convicted sex offender Jesse Timmendequas committed the crimes. His two roommates were convicted sex offenders, the Daily News said.

'We were outraged,' Richard Kanka told the newspaper.

'We wanted to know if the police knew about this. Didn’t anybody know that three convicted sex offenders lived across the street? It turned out nobody knew.'

Though Maureen Kanka said their work was 'so chaotic, and it was so traumatic' to the Daily News, it helped lead to Megan's Law.

The couple also established the Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation, the paper reported.

'Every parent should have the right to know if a dangerous sexual predator moves into their neighborhood,' the foundation's website says. 'That is why Richard and Maureen Kanka made it their lives' mission to see the enactment of Megan's Law in every state.'

The couple continued to help others in the wake of their daughter's death, the Daily News reported.

'Whenever somebody asks me, I can’t say no,' Richard Kanka told the newspaper. 'Whenever they ask me, I’ll be there.'

Richard Kanka also told the Daily News he thought that Timmenquendas' death sentence being changed to life without parole 'was a real slap in the face.'

Maureen Kanka, now a grandmother, told the newspaper 'I know we made an impact.'

Richard Kanka expressed a similar sentiment: 'We sacrificed a lot, hopefully to save a lot.'
