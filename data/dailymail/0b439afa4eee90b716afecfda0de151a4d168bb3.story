A 'wretched and wicked' primary school teacher used a hidden camera to film young boys changing before posting the images online for other paedophiles.

Matthew Ross, 32, hid a tiny camera under his T-shirt to capture the footage of the innocent youngsters.

The depraved teacher then posted the footage of the eight and nine-year-old boys on the internet for other pedophiles.

'Wicked': Paedophile Matthew Ross was jailed for three years for filming the young boys

Ross, previously sacked from a teaching job after turning up at school having taken ecstasy, was yesterday jailed for three years for the 'gross abuse of trust'.

A court heard his actions only came to light in July last year when police investigated his ex-boyfriend for similar offences.

Police who swooped to arrest him even found extreme pornography involving animals and more than 700 indecent images of youngster, ranging from babies to ten-year-olds.

The images he filmed of children changing after swimming lessons were of eight and nine-year-old boys.

Judge John Lodge, sentencing, said: 'What makes this case so serious is that you grossly abused your position of trust.

'It is a blessing, albeit a small blessing, that children did not know they were abused in this way.

'But the footage of them has been spread all over the internet thanks to your wretched and wicked behaviour.'

The school where Ross carried out the filming cannot be named for legal reasons, but parents were informed of the teacher’s actions.

Andrew Bagnall, mitigating, said: 'This will follow him for the rest of his life.

'He is very regretful and deeply ashamed.

'If he could turn back time and change what he has done, he would.'

Ross admitted a charge of voyeurism, as well as three counts of making, possessing and distributing indecent images of children.

He also pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing extreme pornography.

The court heard that Ross had been fired from his job six months before his eventual arrest after turning up to work on a Monday morning having taken ecstasy.

Staff became concerned about his erratic behaviour and Ross, of Station Avenue, Southend, was sent home for the safety of his pupils.

He was then sacked after a General Teaching Council disciplinary hearing found him guilty of unacceptable professional conduct in January 2011.

His depraved filming only came to light after he was no longer a teacher and pupils and his colleagues had no idea of what he had been doing.

Sue Cook, Southend Council’s corporate director for children and learning, said: 'Naturally, everyone connected to the school was shocked and the past few months have been very difficult and challenging for the school community.

'Despite admitting a total of six offences, the indecent images of children do not feature any pupils from the Southend school and they were only affected by the voyeurism charge.

'However, quite properly, those safeguarding arrangements have been reviewed in light of what occurred to ensure that they are as rigorous and robust as they need to be.

'The school has offered support to its staff, parents and pupils throughout and will continue to do so.'
