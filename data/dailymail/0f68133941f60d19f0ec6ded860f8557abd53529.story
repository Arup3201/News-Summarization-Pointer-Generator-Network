Alan Pardew will make a new goalscorer his No.1 priority in January as he bids to resurrect Newcastle’s season.

The Magpies have lost three matches on the spin, including the League Cup quarter-final at Spurs and Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby.

They have scored just once in that period – Ayoze Perez’s consolation in the 4-1 defeat at Arsenal – and while the young Spaniard has been a positive for Pardew, he remains concerned about the condition of seven-goal top scorer Papiss Cisse.

And that will see Pardew ask owner Mike Ashley to open his cheque book when the transfer window reopens in the New Year.

‘I think we are still a striker light,’ he said. ‘Even when Siem de Jong returns, I think we’ll need another one.

‘Papiss - even taking away the flu - he is still not right. He’s not 100 per cent and you could see that in the way he plays. That’s something we need to look at. We need another striker if we can get one.’

Danny Ings is United’s top target but Burnley are determined to keep their star striker until the end of the season, even though his contract expires in the summer.

For now, 21-year-old Perez will continue to lead the line. The £1.5million former Tenerife forward has scored four from eight starts, and Pardew has been pleasantly surprised by his impact.

‘If you said at start of the year he would be in this position I would have said that was unlikely,’ said Pardew, who will start with Perez at Manchester United on Boxing Day.

‘His physical improvement has been immense. He was already technically accomplished, which was obvious when he arrived. His physical attributes and mentality in games have improved massively.

‘He enjoys playing against top opposition as much as lesser opposition and that bodes well. We have been absolutely reliant on him in a lot of ways.

‘I said at the start of the year we were a striker light and we really needed someone to come through and help us out - and he’s done that.’

Pardew, though, is not concerned by Perez’s slight frame.

‘I don’t want him to be a big brute of a player,’ he said. ‘He’s never going to be that, but there is a strength in holding players off the ball and it’s something Remy Cabella needs to gain.

‘When he first arrived he looked too light in training and was knocked off the ball far too easily. He didn’t hold his own in tight areas, but now he does in training and in matches.

‘He’s not going to grow much bigger and I don’t want him to. That wiry strength is a big part of his game.

‘He did a couple of tricks on Sunday that I don’t think anybody else on the pitch could have produced. His feet are so fast. He’s been a real asset.

‘He’s not a natural goalscorer, more a natural forward. He can do the other side of the game, a bit like Wayne Rooney. He can mix it in the midfield and score goals.’
