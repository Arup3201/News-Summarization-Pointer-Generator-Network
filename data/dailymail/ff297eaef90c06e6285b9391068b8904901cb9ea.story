You can never say there is nobody else who could do the job, reasons Nasser Hussain, and cites how Michael Vaughan surprised him in becoming an excellent England captain, despite not showing leadership potential while in the ranks.

Yet I still maintain there are no viable alternatives right now to succeed Alastair Cook, which not only raises doubts about the ECB’s succession plan but also begs the question: where have all the captains gone?

There is no question England want Joe Root to be the next England captain. But they did not expect it to be now, not when he is only 23 with just 19 Tests to his name. And not when he has captained in only one first-class match, which ended with Middlesex chasing 472 to beat his Yorkshire team at Lord’s.

Right person, wrong time: Root is too
young to be England captain

A huge problem in the otherwise progressive world of central contracts is England’s best young players do not receive the leadership experience at county level that traditionally stood them in such good stead with England.

Instead they spend the bulk of their time coming through the age-group and Lions system, and now Root finds himself potentially two Test defeats away from becoming England captain while woefully short of the proper grounding.

England are acutely aware of the problem. They wanted Root to captain the Lions in New Zealand the winter before last, but such was his progress he was fast-tracked into the full England set-up before then.

He was in charge when the Lions played New Zealand at Leicester last season but even that avenue of experience is restricted, with the counties reluctant to release players for the second string during the domestic season.

Not too long ago England appeared to have identified a captain of the future in Yorkshire’s Andrew Gale and for a while he led the Lions with distinction, as well as becoming an impressive captain of the White Rose county.

Under pressure: England captain Alastair Cook after winless streak of 10 Test matches

Trouble is, Gale’s batting has not progressed as well as his captaincy and it has become clear that while Yorkshire are in contention for the championship it does not look as if their skipper will ever be good enough to play at Test level.

Equally, it has been suggested Chris Read, a successful captain with Nottinghamshire, could be a short-term replacement for Cook, but England do not want to go back to an experienced keeper rather than the exciting Jos Buttler.

It leaves England knowing that if the worst happens and Cook’s position really does become untenable over the next three Tests they will have little choice other than to throw Root in at the deep end.

What other options are there? Matt Prior was Cook’s right-hand man but has now gone, while the unofficial vice-captain Ian Bell is surely unsuited to higher office, particularly while he cannot buy a run himself. Ask anyone involved in the England bonding trip a couple of years back — which saw Bell make a total hash of his leadership task — whether he really could take on the mantle of captain of his country.

There is no point either in considering Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson because they are out on their feet due to their workload and could not possibly take on the responsibility of the captaincy, too.

Short of options: Unofficial vice-captain Ian Bell has not shown the right qualities to be skipper

There is an intriguing possibility from outside in Eoin Morgan, who looks an instinctive captain, but he would be under enormous pressure from the start if he had to prove himself both as a skipper and Test batsman. Better to give Morgan the one-day captaincy if Cook has to go at the end of this Test series and see how he copes with that first.

It will not help their predicament now but there is a way the ECB could try to create a new generation of potential captains and it comes from a suggestion made to me this week by one of the leading county chairmen.

He wants it made mandatory for every county to have a captain who is qualified for England and I would go further and say they should also be under 25 so they have potential to grow into an England player and captain.

It would need the co-operation and patience of the counties, but they must remember the health of the domestic game is almost totally dependent on the health of the national side.

For the sake of England they should not appoint overseas players or even senior English ones as their captains in future.

If each county had a young, English captain then surely England will have many more candidates to choose from when, say, Root the England captain is struggling for runs and is being criticised for his field placings in five years’ time.

Last word

Amid all the England gloom it may have gone unnoticed that Jonathan Trott scored his first century  since returning to first-class cricket with Warwickshire.

And he had to withstand a spell of short-pitched bowling on Wednesday from Sussex’s England paceman Chris Jordan, too.

99? No, it was a 100: Jonathan Trott cools down with an ice-cream after scoring 106

It does not matter at this stage whether the  33-year-old might play for England again.

It is simply that, after all he has been through, it is absolutely fantastic to see him back.
