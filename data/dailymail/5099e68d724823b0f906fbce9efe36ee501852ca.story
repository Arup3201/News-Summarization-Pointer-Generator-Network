Queen Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton believes that footballers should be thought of as role models, but people should not be so quick to castigate players if and when they make mistakes.

The 32-year-old feels that more consideration needs to be given regarding the pressures that come with living life in the public eye.

And Barton, renowned for his straight-talking approach, is mystified by the idea that footballers are expected to behave perfectly all of the time while competing on the pitch.Â

'Are footballers role models? I suppose we are, and we have to be mindful of what we say and what we do, but as an industry we take ourselves far too seriously,' Barton said in an interview with the Daily Mirror.

'I see pundits on the box, saying kids will watch Match of the Day and copy what they see, but if you tell your children to live their lives exactly as they see footballers on the telly doing it, you must be a bit of an idiot.

'If you copied Hollyoaks or EastEnders everyone would kill each other over Christmas, because that's what happens on TV, isn't it?'

Barton added that learning from mistakes under the gaze of the masses provides high profile figures with pressures that most people do not have to face.

'We all screw up, we screw up multiple times on multiple scales, but when every decision you make is in the spotlight, a lot of responsibility comes with it,' Barton said.

Barton will be looking to lead by example when QPR travel to Burnley on Saturday, looking to end a miserable run of 10 defeats in 10 on the road in the Premier League this season.
