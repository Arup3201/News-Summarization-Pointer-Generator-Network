Author Tom Bower has claimed that family jewellery smuggled out of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia at the outbreak of World War Two has been lost by Barclays bank

Author Tom Bower has claimed that family jewellery smuggled out of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia at the outbreak of World War Two has been lost by Barclays bank. 

Mr Bower - who has written biographies on music mogul Simon Cowell and Virgin boss Richard Branson - said the family heirlooms were smuggled out of Prague  two days into Hitler's occupation in March 1939, as his family fled the Czech capital.

They were then kept in a safe-deposit box in the Barclays branch in Finchley in 1986.

But in March 2012, Mr Bower said he discovered that the precious jewels had disappeared.

He admits he did not keep detailed records of what was in the box, which he claims was filled with 'several plastic bags filled with necklaces, rings, earrings, hat pins and brooches all sparkling with diamonds, rubies and emeralds'.

Writing in the Sunday Times, he said he saw the contents, placing the deeds to his own house in the metal box.

But after his father passed away, Mr Bowen visited the box to withdraw his own personal documents and said he discovered the jewels were missing.

He said: 'The family heirlooms, which had been protected from successive regimes in central Europe, were finally lost thanks to Barclays.'

Mr Bower complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service, but his complaint was rejected after an adjudicator found 'there was no conclusive evidence to show what exactly was in the box'.

He said the way the situation was dealt with was 'a disgrace'.

Mr Bower - who has written biographies on music mogul Simon Cowell and Virgin boss Rochard Branson - said the family heirlooms were smuggled out of Prague two days into Hitler's occupation in March 1939, as his family fled the Czech capital. They were then kept in a safe-deposit box in the Barclays branch in Finchley in 1986

A Barclays spokesman said: 'We have corresponded with Mr Bower on this matter on several occasions in the past, and both our rigorous investigation and that of the Financial Ombudsman Service have concluded that his jewellery could not have gone missing while in our safekeeping.

'At no time while Mr Bower was the owner of the box was the bank in possession of the key.

'We have apologised to Mrs Bower for the inconvenient process in closing her dormant account and offered her a gesture of goodwill last March. The claim of harassment by members of our branch staff is wholly unjustified.'

Bower, a journalist and investigative historian, has previously published a book on Branson and has also written books about Robert Maxwell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, Gordon Brown and Simon Cowell.

In 2003, Bower won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award for Broken Dreams, an investigation into corruption in English football.
