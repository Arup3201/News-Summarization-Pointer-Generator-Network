Manchester United’s sense of injustice over Wayne Rooney’s red card on Saturday has been heightened by their private view that defender Luke Shaw was the victim of a headbutt by West Ham forward Diafra Sakho.

United manager Louis van Gaal made the slightly peculiar claim on Saturday night that Rooney’s foul of Stewart Downing in the second half of his team’s 2-1 win at Old Trafford was no worse than some tackles committed by their opponents.

However it was an alleged incident between Shaw and Sakho that infuriated United as the teenage full-back left the stadium sporting a huge shiner beneath his left eye.

United would not comment publicly on the matter but at one stage in the second-half Shaw was seen remonstrating with a linesman who he clearly felt should have picked up the incident.

On Sunday night, the FA had no record of a complaint and will wait to see if there is anything in the report of referee Lee Mason when it drops on Monday morning.

Shaw was also critical of the decision to send off Rooney and claimed his tackle was no worse than a trip on him by Sakho earlier in the game.

'We have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza’s red card as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn’t stop play,' said Shaw.

'Earlier in the game, Sakho did the same to me.

'But I just focus on winning games and I’ll keep doing that.'
