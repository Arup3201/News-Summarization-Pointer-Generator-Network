They'll never be able to replace the love they felt for their father, or the good times they enjoyed as family, but the co-workers of a slain police officer weren't about to let a Michigan mans' three daughters miss out on a rite of passage.

11-year-old Eileen, 9-year-old Mary and 6-year-old Andrea are the daughters of West Bloomfield, Michigan police Officer Patrick O’Rourke, who was killed in the line of duty in September of 2012.

Three of his colleagues escorted his girls to a Daddy-Daughter dance at Schmidt Middle School in Fenton.

Officer Art Smith, who served on the honor guard at the funeral, escorted Eileen O’Rourke, while Officers Derek Case and Joe Miller, who were both on the scene the day Patrick O’Rourke was killed, escorted Mary and Andrea.

Amy O’Rourke says while she didn’t know the three officers before that tragic day, she considers them family now.

'We cry together,' wife Amy said. 'We laugh together. We try to heal. It’s all very raw. It’s all still very emotional,' she told the Detroit Free Press.

O'Rourke who had been a West Bloomfield officer for 12 years, was married to his high-school sweetheart Amy and had four children.

The policeman's father told WXYZ he was experiencing 'a rollercoaster of emotions' as he paid tribute to a son who was 'as strong as three men'.
