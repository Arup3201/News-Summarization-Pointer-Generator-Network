The race is on for the Premier League title and it appears Brendan Rodgers will be behind his players every step of the way - and not just on the pitch.

The Liverpool boss appeared to be setting an example to his squad in training before his side's heavyweight battle at Manchester City on Monday, taking part in physical drills as the Reds look to start the season with successive victories.

The clash at the champions is an early opportunity for Rodgers to see where his new look Liverpool side are compared to their rivals following the summer spend-up and Luis Suarez's departure to Barcelona.

He's behind you: The Liverpool boss has a personal training regime having always valued personal fitness 

Rodgers' efforts in training are not just a one-off though, with the former Swansea boss having a training regime to ensure his keeps his personal fitness in check.

The Liverpool boss went for a 50-minute run around Manchester when his side visited Manchester United last September and regularly jogs around the training pitches at Melwood.

Rodgers has always valued his personal fitness and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in 2011 to raise funds for the Marie Curie cancer fund.

Liverpool's meeting at the Etihad Stadium comes at a time when the Reds are close to securing a deal for former City striker Mario Balotelli, but Rodgers has warned the incoming AC Milan star that he has to abide by club rules.

'We have an intensive code of conduct for any member of staff here,' Rodgers said. 'That covers everyone, not one particular individual.

'Nothing will ever shake our fantastic environment. We've got a learning environment for players.'
