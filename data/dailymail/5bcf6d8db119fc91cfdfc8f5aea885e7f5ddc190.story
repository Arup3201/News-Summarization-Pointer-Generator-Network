A schoolboy who had his hair cut like football idol Sergio Aguero has been ordered to wear a hat in lessons or stay home until it grows back, his family claim.

Ten-year-old Tom Moseley was told his short back and sides hairstyle, modelled on the Manchester City striker's look, was too extreme by staff St Gilbert's Primary School in Winton, Eccles, and he was removed from school on his birthday.

His family say they were told he could either return to classes when his hair had grown, restyle it or wear a hat at all times.

Parents Lisa, 39, and Kirk, 43, have attacked the school's decision and have decided to keep Tom out of school, likening the school's hat suggestion to wearing a 'dunce's cap'.

Mr Moseley said: 'Sergio Aguero is his idol and he has had that haircut for six months.

'He is being punished for a haircut but he has consistently achieved good results and is well behaved in class.

'We were given three options - take him out of school until it grows, get it cut or sit in class wearing a hat and he won't be allowed to play football at school. He would also have to sit outside the headteacher's office at break times wearing the hat.

'We decided to keep him out of school because I am not having him sitting with the equivalent of a dunce's hat on.'

Tom's mother Lisa, 39, left, said she was not willing to send her son, centre, pictured alongside father Kirk, right, to school if he had to wear the equivalent of 'a dunce's cap' or play football at break times 

But headteacher Cheryl Fox said: 'We set clear standards on hair and dress at this school which parents are made fully aware of and accept when pupils enrol.

'We always suggest that an unsuitable haircut can be trimmed into an acceptable style without going down the skinhead route or that the child can wear a hat of their choice in school.

'If the parents wish to keep the child away from school until the haircut grows out we will ensure their education does not suffer.

'It's our responsibility to prepare children for high school, college, university and employment where they will be expected to follow the rules of the establishment or dress code of their employer.

'We want our children to succeed and will continue to do all we can towards that aim.'
