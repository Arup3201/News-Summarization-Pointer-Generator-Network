This is the incredible moment more than 25,000 teddy bears rained down on the ice during a Calgary Hitmen hockey game in Canada.

The toys were tossed from the stands as part of the the world-famous Teddy Bear Toss Hockey Game, in which the stuffed animals are collected and distributed to children's charities.

The concept behind the festive tradition is that each spectator brings a teddy bear which they then throw onto the ice when the home team first scores.

The annual Teddy Bear Toss is a seasonal tradition carried out by hockey clubs across North America, but the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League are the undisputed kings of the toss

When Ridal Fazleev scored at 1:38 of the first period in the game against the Moose Jaw Warriors, 25,214 teddy bears and other stuffed toys sailed down from the stands, almost covering the ice.

It took nearly 40 minutes for the deluge of toys to be swept up and collected from the ice by seven trucks. The bears will now be distributed among 60 local children's charities.

The annual Teddy Bear Toss is a seasonal tradition carried out by hockey clubs across North America, but the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League  are the undisputed kings of the toss.

The team currently hold the record of most toys collected, after 26,919 bears hit the ice when Ian Duval scored against the Cougars in 2002. 

Buzz Bishop, 44, was at the stadium this year for the Hitmen's 20th Teddy Bear Hockey Game with sons Zacharie, seven, and four-year-old Charlie.

He said: 'There's a positive spirit and electricity as everyone is excited for the charity. 

'My sons look forward to the game each year and really enjoy catching the bears from the upper seats and tossing them below and watching them fly. 

'It's the third year attending for us, and it's become a holiday tradition.' 

The dad posted the original video of the Teddy Bear Toss on his blog, which he uses to raise money and awareness for people living with diabetes.

Money raised via ads on the site Buzz's Blog goes towards supporting his runs for Team Diabetes, which is group that raises awareness of the condition through events held across Canada and the world.
