The sister of the American woman who went missing with her boyfriend in Peru last month said she fears the two may have been kidnapped.

Jamie Neal, 25, and Garrett Hand, 27, from California’s Bay Area, left for Peru in December and were last heard from on January 25, according to the missing woman's sister, Jennifer Neal.

‘There's a part of me that thinks someone has taken them,’ Jennifer Neal, who lives in West Sacramento, told FoxNews.com on Monday.

The U.S. State Department has been assisting in the search for the missing couple, who reportedly disappeared in January during a biking trip in the South American country.

Jennifer Neal said her sister has stopped posting photos of their trip on Facebook and said Hand's cellphone is turned off.

‘It goes straight to voicemail,’ she told FOX. ‘It's not like them to be out of touch for this long.’

The couple disappeared in Peru in an area where a criminal gang were believed to have been plotting to kidnap tourists, authorities said yesterday.

The U.S. State Department issued a poster of the couple from San Francisco - who were last seen getting on a bus in the town of Cusco, headed for Lima on January 26 before getting in a cab.

The couple are biking enthusiasts who both work in cycle stores in the Bay Area of San Francisco.

They had customized their bikes especially for the trip which began in December.

They had also traveled to Chile and Argentina before deciding to go to the Amazon instead of Machu Picchu in Peru.

Friends told KTVU that they had hoped the couple simply had mechanical issues with their bikes but after they were spotted in the Peruvian capital, it seemed unlikely.

Adventure: The young couple (pictured at left) went missing in a region which was under threat of kidnappings

The U.S. Embassy in Peru along with local police are now looking clues as to what happened to the couple.

The U.S. Embassy's website 
posted a warning for travelers about a kidnapping threat in the region on February 
13.

Authorities said that American 
citizens should be aware of the threat from a criminal 
gang in the Cusco and Machu Picchu regions through the month of February.

The U.S. Embassy has severely limited travel for officials at this time and has warned travelers to be on high alert.

The families of both Mr Hand and Miss Neal have created a Facebook page which they want to be widely shared among travelers in Peru in the hope of finding out their loved ones.

Garrett Hand is 25 years old, has blonde hair, green eyes and is 6ft tall. Miss Neal, 27, has brown, curly hair, blue eyes and is 5'5.
