Money rolling in: Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor earned $1.2million from a new book contract

Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor revealed the fact that her ex-husband brought a bag of Quaaludes to his new wife on their wedding night.

She also told other unusually personal stories about her upbringing in the Bronx, like how she unknowingly brought her cousin to a drug den where he shot up heroin.

Sotomayor went on to describe how her personal health battle with diabetes caused her to fear dying at a young age and, in turn, stopped her from having children.

Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor told of these intimate stories about her upbringing in her memoir, titled 'My Beloved World', which is due to be released in January.

The Associated Press received an early copy of the book and previewed some of the most interesting anecdotes about the justice's upbringing.

Given her position as one of the three-serving female judges on the country's highest bench, Sotomayor wrote only about her life leading up to her judicial career, purposefully avoiding any potential conflicts of interest.

Much of the book is spent discussing Sotomayor's underprivileged upbringing in the South Bronx, where her family was so poor that they never had a bank account.

The 'world' that the book's title refers to is one in which her Puerto Rican parents and her siblings only spoke Spanish and not English in their tenement apartment.

Growing up: Sotomayor was raised by her Puerto Rican parents in a tenement in the South Bronx, and the family was so poor that they did not have a bank account

One potentially political stance that Sotomayor takes in the book is one of support for affirmative action as she credits it to the reason why she was admitted to Princeton University and Yale Law School. She say that it is needed to get disadvantaged students to the starting line of a race to success.

She acknowledges she entered through a 
special door reserved for minority students but writes that her 
accomplishments at Princeton- including receiving the highest prize 
given to seniors, earning a place in the Phi Beta Kappa honor society 
and graduating with highest honors- speak for themselves.

The up-from-poverty story is in many respects similar to the one told by her Supreme Court seatmate, Justice Clarence Thomas, in 'My Grandfather's Son.' Both grew up with few creature comforts and ran into prejudice on a regular basis.

But where Thomas has become a strong opponent of affirmative action and says he felt stigmatized by the racial preference that also helped him get into Yale, Sotomayor says she took the opportunity to join the elite and ran with it.

She acknowledges that her Hispanic heritage played a role in her rise to the Supreme Court, where she is the first Latina and third woman to be a justice.

She says she has never let slurs about her roots or put-downs based on her gender get the best of her.

One thing that has plagued her throughout her life, however, has been her struggles with diabetes.

Sotomayor has spoken publicly and movingly about her diabetes before. She told children with diabetes that she suspected something was wrong when she started wetting her bed.

In her book, Sotomayor relates several instances where she blacked out and was found unconscious, including by a roommate at Princeton, a client in Venice, Italy, and a friend's barking dog.

She said such episodes were never frequent and have been rare in the last decade.

The disease may have been a big part of her decision not to have children, but Sotomayor says that partly as a result, she is godmother to more children than anyone she knows.

Her beloved cousin Nelson comes up in the book, who eventually died of AIDS that she said he contracted through a contaminated needle.

Sotomayor says she was working as a prosecutor when she gave Nelson a lift to what he told her only after the fact was a drug den in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx and waited for him in her car while he shot up heroin inside.

The book also gives a look into her romantic life, detailing her marriage to her high school sweetheart, Kevin Noonan, soon after they graduated from college. They divorced during Sotomayor's time as a prosecutor in Manhattan, but parted amicably.

One detail Sotomayor notes is that on their wedding night, Noonan produced a bag of Quaaludes- the hynotic-sedative that was popular in the 1970s- that was a gift from his friends. She insisted he flush the pills down the toilet.

She says she used to smoke three-and-a-half packs of cigarettes a day, until she saw her young niece holding a pencil between her fingers and blowing imaginary rings of smoke.

She spent five days in a residential program to quit smoking and says she hasn't had a cigarette since.

But she could imagine lighting up one more time on her deathbed, as her grandmother did.

Making the contrast between Sotomayor's past and present lives, she is taking home $1.2million from the book, which is due to be published simultaneously in English and Spanish in the new year.
