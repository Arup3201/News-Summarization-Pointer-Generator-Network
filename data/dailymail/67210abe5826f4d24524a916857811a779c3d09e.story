Bethenny Frankel is courting even more controversy for that selfie she took while wearing her four-year-old's pajamas.

In a scathing editorial published on the Huffington Post on Thursday, Dr Drew's daughter Paulina Pinsky - who has been very open about her own struggles with eating disorders - accuses the 43-year-old reality star of 'exploiting others who struggle with... insecurities and mental illnesses for pure economic gain'.

The 21-year-old added that Bethenny's behavior will likely have a negative effect on her daughter Bryn. 'Teaching a child that maintaining her toddler-sized body is what she should want is only going to set her up for a life plagued by body insecurities,' she wrote.

Too far? In the photo posted on July 13, the Skinnygirl mogul poses in her daughter Bryn's tiny Hello Kitty sleepwear. 'Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?' she captioned it

In the photo in question, the Skinnygirl mogul strikes a pose in her daughter's tiny Hello Kitty sleepwear. She captioned the picture: 'This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?'

The post sparked a heated debate online about whether it was appropriate for the star to show off her thin frame in such a way.

'She is blatantly perpetuating the 
unrealistic standard of beauty that declares that we must all shrink 
ourselves down to fit into what is considered "beautiful" and "sexy,"' wrote Paulina.

The senior at Barnard College in New York also said the photo reminded her of her own experience during her teen years, when she would desperately try to fit into her childhood clothes, 'because I told myself that I would fit back into those tiny excuses one day.'

Knows from experience: Paulina (pictured with her mother Susan) first opened up about her own seven-year battle with anorexia and bulimia in February and has since become an advocate for awareness

Paulina, whose editorial was titled Bethenny Frankel, You Are Not Being Funny, also took a jab at the intended humor in Bethenny's post.

'The last time I checked, Bethenny Frankel is not a comedian,' she wrote. 'Stay out of comedy, Ms Frankel. You do a better job making a living exploiting body insecurities.

'And once you realize that you are part of the problem, there are people waiting for you to become part of the solution,' she concluded.

Paulina knows from experience just how much a mother's outlook on body image can affect her children.

Negative influence: 'Teaching a child that maintaining her toddler-sized body is what she should want is only going to set her up for a life plagued by body insecurities,' added Paulina (pictured with her parents in 2009)

When she first opened up about her own seven-year battle with anorexia and bulimia in February, Paulina - who is a triplet with two brothers - put much of the blame on her mother Susan.

'She needed me to be perfect,' Paulina 
wrote at the time. 'I was the pretty blonde girl who was a cheerleader 
and an ice skater. I got good grades, had a boyfriend and was thin: I 
was living the life everyone had always told me I should want for 
myself.'

Since then, she and her mother have apparently strengthened their relationship, and Paulina has made it her mission to be a spokesperson for others struggling with eating disorders.

Talking back: Following the initial controversy, Bethenny (pictured in May with Bryn) took to Twitter to defend herself, writing: 'The fact that a silly pic is int'l news means people need to get a hobby & a life [sic]'

'We are so proud of Paulina and her outreach to help others and particularly empower women,' Dr Drew said in a February statement.

'When she recognized she needed help she sought treatment and actively engaged in the process. And now she is using her insights to help others.'

Following the initial controversy caused by her post, Bethenny took to Twitter to defend herself, writing: 'The fact that a silly pic is int'l news means people need to get a hobby & a life [sic]'.

She later added jokingly: 'My daughter still has some shirts from when she was 2. I hope she isn't sending the wrong message to toddlers.'
