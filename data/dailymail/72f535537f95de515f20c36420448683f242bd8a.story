Police have launched an investigation after a woman was caught on CCTV steeling a poppy appeal collection box from a London pub.

Images from CCTV footage from the The Barnsbury in Islington, north London, show a woman approaching two friends at the bar, before she then slips the blue Royal British Legion box into her handbag.

The collection box, which is believed to have had more than £100 in, was stolen on November 9, just two days before Remembrance Sunday and the day before the pub held its annual free dinner and drinks for former service personnel.

The three women were dressed in jeans and jackets and left the pub after only ordering tap water.

Bar manager Peter Vatsov told The Evening Standard: ‘Three women came into the pub at lunchtime and asked for tap water.

'One of the women went to the toilet and the other two girls just stood at the bar. When the first woman came back she slipped the box into her bag.' 

Mr Vatsov, 27, said he only noticed the box was missing the next day, prompting him to look at the pub’s CCTV footage.

He added: ‘This is just really sad. It’s a charity box. I never would have thought that someone could do that.

'Those women obviously have no morals. They clearly knew that the box would be full because it was only days before Remembrance Sunday.'

Pub owner Steve Coxshall said he believed the women were eastern European.

He added in the Evening Standard: 'This is the lowest form of crime in my view. What saddens me is the next day we had the war veterans in. My staff couldn’t wear poppies and we had no collection box.'
