Back in the summer I wrote in this column that Bojan was one of the best and most exciting signings of the transfer window and if he could recapture his teenage magic, then Stoke City would have a wonderful player. They'd also have more proof for the sceptics that they're no longer a rugby team and are changing their style.

Well on Saturday I was at the Britannia Stadium to see the former Barcelona man run the show against Arsenal. He wanted the ball all the time, even in tight situations, rarely wasted a pass, treasured possession and created. He scored, he even tracked back and worked hard. He was head, shoulders and torso ahead of everyone else on the pitch. It was a joy to watch.

I interviewed Stoke's Geoff Cameron this week who said that it took Bojan a little while to settle in and adapt to the Premier League, but that he has been brilliant in recent weeks. Cameron told me: 'He's making players better around him, he's starting to get comfortable, he's going to be known as our main guy, the one who makes us tick.'

And it got me thinking.

Is it possible that Bojan is on his way to becoming Stoke City's greatest ever player?

They've had some amazing names down the years – some legends of football like Gordon Banks, Sir Stanley Matthews, Peter Shilton and Sir Geoff Hurst.

Other players are true legends who will forever be in the hearts of Stoke City fans – the likes of Mike Pejic, Terry Conroy, George Eastham and Denis Smith, who all played with the Potters when they won their only major honour to date, the League Cup in 1972.

Matthews is probably the No 1. He was starring for the club when they enjoyed their highest ever league placing of fourth, and was still with them when they matched it a few years later. He trebled the crowd when he returned to Stoke in 1961 and played for the club at the age of 50 – incredible.

There will be few players who have worn the Stoke City shirt and had more technical ability than Bojan but he needs to show that ability and apply it in matches successfully over a period of time.

It doesn't have to be a very long time – Mark Stein is considered a Stoke legend by many fans despite only spending just over two years at the club.

To be the greatest Stoke player ever, Bojan also has to make a major contribution to them winning a trophy. They came close in 2011 when they lost 1-0 to Manchester City in the FA Cup final. But that 1972 Wembley win over Chelsea remains their greatest day.

At 24, Bojan has time to make himself a Stoke City legend. But he is also young enough to catch the eye of clubs around Europe and re-establish himself on the big stage.

Make no mistake, the Spanish international has had Stoke fans on the edge of their seats in recent weeks. As his impact grows, he will be man-marked and kicked. If he can cope with all that, he will be one of the stars of the Premier League this season.

If he takes the club to another level, and a major trophy, then he could become Stoke's greatest ever player. And if Matthews were alive to watch Bojan's style and class at the Britannia Stadium, I'm sure he'd give his blessing.
