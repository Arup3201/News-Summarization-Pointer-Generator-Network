Fed-up with watching his son's team lose heavily in a teenage rugby cup final, this father decided to put the boot in himself.

He was caught on camera sticking a foot out to deliberately trip up an opposition player just as the winning side was about to score yet another try.

The trip-up sent the attacking teenage player flying, incensing parents on the sideline.

A father watching his team lose heavily in a teenage rugby cup final in Hertfordshire was caught deliberately tripping a opposition player

The referee of the Hertfordshire Shield cup final had to intervene and then sent the spectator off from the side of the pitch and halted the match 10 minutes before the end of the game.

Despite the incident the Royston Rugby Club U16 team was awarded a 64-5 victory against neighbouring rivals, Fullerians.

Outraged parents and players condemned the father, believed to be a parent of one of the boys playing, who has since been disciplined by the Fullerians club.

Jonathan Robson wrote on Twitter: 'Royston U16 won despite this idiot at Fullerians, how can somones (sic) dad do this'

Royston Rugby Club president Jamie Johnson said he had next heard of such an 'extraordinary' incident during a youth match.

'There is now an investigation taking place within their club and we will also be putting forward our own statement,' the president said.

Fullerians' president Mike Musk described the apparent trip as 'deplorable' and said swift action had been taken. The club is pictured here

Fullerians' president Mike Musk described the apparent trip as 'deplorable' and said swift action had been taken.

'I wasn't there, but I've seen the photo. We have had a committee meeting since and will have further meetings,' he said.

'It was certainly deplorable and the only mitigation I can give is that it would seem that it was out of character for this person.

'We have taken action and as far as I am aware, he has been banned from the touchline at matches until next December or January.'

He also hoped the matter would remain between the two clubs and would not need to be investigated at a higher level.

The Royston president was disappointed that the incident might detract from such a dominant victory for the young Royston side, who had won the trophy at U-15 level last year before triumphing again on Sunday and also won their Saracens League division this season.

The Royston side scored 10 tries and were ahead 26-5 at half time.
