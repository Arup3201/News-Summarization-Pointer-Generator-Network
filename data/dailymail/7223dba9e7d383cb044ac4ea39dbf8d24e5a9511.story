Gunman: Michael Atherton shot dead three women then turned the gun on himself at a house in Horden, Peterlee, on New Year's Day

Triple killer Michael Atherton was 'a good man' - according to the daughter who he almost killed in his New Year's Day gun attack.

Laura McGoldrick, 19, was slightly wounded but managed to escape the slaughter in Horden, Peterlee, County Durham by climbing through an upstairs window.

But Atherton, 42, shot his partner Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and niece Tanya Turnbull, 24, shortly after returning home from a pub that evening.

He blasted them with his licensed shotgun before killing himself.

A joint statement from Laura and her brother, Michael Atherton Jnr, paid tribute to all four who died in the shootings

'We are truly devastated,' they said. 'Me and my sister have lost the best mother in the world. We don't understand why my dad would do anything like this as he was such a good man.

'At the end of the day we have lost four loved family members and we hope they are all at peace now.'

Mr Atherton's parents, Peter and Christine, said: 'We and our whole family want to express our sympathies to the families of Susan, Alison and Tanya.

'Although we loved Michael, we are sorry for his actions and don't understand why he did what he did.

'We dearly loved Susan as a daughter for over 20 years and are devastated by the loss.'

The tributes come after it emerged police seized Atherton’s shotguns three years ago – but returned them to him because they did not think he posed a danger.

Officers were called out to his home on September 10, 2008, and removed six guns from Atherton’s home amid concerns for his mental health after he threatened to shoot himself.

He applied to get them back and they were returned to him on November 18 that year after he simply denied that he had ever felt suicidal.

Yesterday MPs said the decision on removing guns should not be left solely to the discretion of a police officer and must involve a health professional as well as checks with the owner’s partner.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission today launched an investigation into firearms licensing matters in the wake of the rampage.

Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry said Atherton and his partner of 19 years had gone out separately and ‘an argument took place’ on their return to the semi-detached house in Greenside Avenue, Peterlee, County Durham.

He said: ‘Mr Atherton produced a shotgun and in a matter of moments shot dead Susan, Tanya and Alison before turning the gun on himself.’

The women’s bodies were found in the kitchen and living room and a shotgun was by Atherton’s side.

Inquests into the four deaths will open at Chester-le-Street Magistrates' Court at 10am tomorrow.

Relatives of the three dead women paid tributes to them in
a statement, saying: 'We as a family would like to take this 
opportunity to express our devastation at the loss we have suffered 
following the tragic events of Sunday evening and would like to pay 
individual tributes to each of our much-loved family members whom we 
have lost.

'Susan was a
much-loved sister, who was adored by both family and friends. She was 
particularly close to her sisters and loved spending time with them.

'She was so caring and all that mattered to her was her family. We are shocked and shattered by what's happened.

'Alison was a fantastic mother, sister and partner who was always there for her family and friends when we needed her.

'She was a fantastic mam to her son, Bobby, and daughter, Tanya, always so caring and loving.

'Tanya was the most amazing daughter, partner and sister you could ever wish for.

'She was a popular, funny and a gorgeous girl with her whole life ahead of her, and we idolised her.

'Tanya
and her boyfriend, Michael, were in the process of preparing for their 
life together and had plans to buy their first home.

'It was an exciting time for Tanya and she was always smiling and happy.

'This
horrific loss is still sinking in and, as we are sure you can 
appreciate, we are devastated to lose Tanya in such tragic 
circumstances.

'We would also like to offer our heartfelt condolences to young Michael and Laura, who we know will be devastated by their loss.

'It's extremely important to us as a family that we are left in peace to grieve our loss and begin to recover from this.

'We
would ask that the media respect our privacy and that we be left alone 
to comfort one another and attempt to come to terms with our devastating
loss.'

Laughing killer: Michael Atherton at an awards evening in 2005. He was a keen angler and took up shooting several years ago

Friends said the once ‘happy-go-lucky’  family man had been depressed about a heart problem.Neighbour Jean Gray, 74, said both Atherton and Mrs McGoldrick were ‘very good neighbours’.

She added: ‘I couldn’t say anything bad about either of them. He was a happy-go-lucky person and very well liked.

‘I just don’t know what happened to him. He must have snapped somehow.’

Atherton was a keen angler before taking up game shooting several years ago.

Elaine Wilkinson, a friend who runs a
fishing tackle shop, said Mrs McGoldrick phoned her last year to ask 
for advice because Atherton was refusing to get treatment for a heart 
problem. Mrs Wilkinson’s husband, Bert, died three years ago from a 
heart attack.

‘She was 
really worried about Mick, she was on about his heart and the fact that 
he wasn’t doing anything about it,’ she said. ‘He was a very friendly 
chap on the outside but I don’t know what he was like between the four 
walls of his house.

‘He had suffered from depression for 
quite a while, I think. I don’t know if that’s got something to do with 
this. They were both hot-headed but very nice people.’

Police
have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints  
Committee over the decision to return three licensed shotguns and three 
‘high-powered’ firearms, believed to be rifles, after Atherton 
threatened to shoot himself in 2008.

Grahame
Morris, Labour MP for Easington, said: ‘At the time the police took his
firearms from him and he applied to have them returned. Police made an 
assessment and they were returned to him.’

Durham Police confirmed 
that the weapons were taken from Mr Atherton’s house as a precaution, 
but as he insisted there had been no threat to harm himself, the weapons
were returned.

That 
decision followed national procedure, a force spokesman said. ‘It was 
one person’s word against another,’ he said. ‘If there were no grounds 
for applying for the revocation of a firearms licence the guns would be 
returned to the firearms licence holder.’

Commenting
on firearms regulations, Mr Morris said: ‘At the moment it is fairly 
subjective – the police are responsible for carrying out an assessment 
of whether an individual is a fit and proper person to hold a firearms 
licence.

‘My view is 
there should be some input from a suitably qualified health care 
professional. Secondly, I also wonder whether it is reasonable to keep 
firearms in a domestic situation.'
