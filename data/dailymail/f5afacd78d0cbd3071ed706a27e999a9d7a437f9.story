Pilots flying an aircraft have been witnessed dramatically battling 60mph crosswinds while attempting to land at Manchester Airport.

The strong winds could be seen blasting the Emirates Airbus A380 yesterday onto an angle and throwing it off course as it approached the tarmac.

It came as several days of wild weather began lashing parts of Britain, with 4in (10cm) of snow falling yesterday - and 6in (15cm) on the way today.

The Airbus A380 arrived in the wet and wild conditions at the start of a cold front expected to send temperatures plummeting to below zero.

Meanwhile, large parts of Britain have been hit by snow today, prompting travel disruption and health fears.

And the Met Office has an amber ‘be prepared’ weather warning in place for snow in northern parts of England and Scotland for today.

A cold weather front is to sweep across the UK with temperatures expected to plunge overnight into today by as much as 10C to below zero.

Manchester Airport was closed today to allow snowploughs to clear the runways. The closure started at 9.20am and was due to last until 10.30am.

A spokesman said: 'We are not accepting any flights in or out due to the weather. 

'If we open at 10.30am those flights that are ready to take off will be able to do so.'

But she added: 'We might experience a small backlog.'
