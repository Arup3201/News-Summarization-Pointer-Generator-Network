As the sun sets behind the Atlas Mountains, the air hums with the call of cicadas, fragrant with the scent of the orange groves.

The Royal Palm Marrakech rises majestically from the arid desert, 12 kilometres outside of the ancient Red City.

A 'five-star plus' golf resort and villas sits on 231 hectares surrounded by palm trees, lavender bushes and over 4,000 olive trees.

The Royal Palm Marrakech is a 'five star plus' resort at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, 12 kilometres from the ancient Red City

The 231 hectare hotel is osurrounded by palm trees, lavender bushes and over 4,000 olive trees

Like mirage in the desert, the 2,000 square-metre pool curves around lush manicured gardens

The Medina's heady mix of crowded squares filled with street performers, smoky food stands and bartering tourists is soon forgotten as I arrive in this oasis of luxurious calm and understated opulence.

The impressive lobby is entered across an over-water footbridge, surrounded by pits aglow with fire. Inside, the decor is a harmonious blend of contemporary design and traditional Berber motifs.

The Royal Palm is the first Beachcomber property outside of the Indian Ocean, and there are 134 suites and villas on the expansive grounds. 

The Royal Palm is a welcome oasis of calm after days negotiating the souks of Marrakech

Beautifully appointed suites seamlessly blend contemporary conveniences with traditional Berber motifs

The Presidential Suite is a staggering 310 square-metres with separate wings and a terrace with panoramic views

Private villas are secluded and set amid the olive groves, each with its own pool and hammam. 

Six tiers of suites range from 72 square-metre Junior Suite up to the magnificent 310 square-metre Presidential Suite. Make no mistake: Royal Palm Marrakech is not the kind of hotel where you need to worry about being dumped in a windowless, oversized broom cupboard.

As much care and attention is given to the sleek design and elegant touches of the lowest level suite as there is to the Prince Villa. 

Limestone tiles are a welcome coolness underfoot after returning from a day poolside under the blazing Moroccan sun or negotiating the frenetic souks. 

Marble bathrooms with sunken tubs also feature outdoor showers in the opulent Prince villa

The Royal Palm is the first Beachcomber property outside of the Indian Ocean, where the brand has a number of luxury resorts

Berber-style carpets and soft furnishings and Mashrabiya latticework feature throughout the rooms, melding seamlessly with the contemporary conveniences.

An obscenely large marble bathroom with oversized walk-in shower and deep freestanding bathtub connects to an open-plan walk-in wardrobe and dressing room that niftily lights up as you enter.

I wake from slumbers in the cloud like bed to views from the terrace of snow-capped mountains towering over the 18 hole Par 72 golf course - the only high-end hotel golf course in Marrakech.

Three restaurants ensure that my swimwear is feeling a little too snug by the end of the visit: La Caravane features cosy private dining alcoves for a romantic meal and is also the setting for an al fresco breakfast.

Le Bar is a chic lounge featuring a sunken gold bar and hanging Moroccan lanterns

Couples can enjoy a romantic meal in private dining alcoves of the main restaurant, La Caravane

There are made-to-order dishes as well as a sumptuous buffet, where waiters scurry to relieve me of my heaving plate to carry to my table, giving no hint of judgement over my selection of full English with all the trimmings, three different pastries, fruit, and crepes all on the same plate - for which I am grateful.

The poolside L’Olivier serves lighter fare during the day: Tuna tartare, tomato tart, and marinated salmon are all on the menu when I visit.

Al Ain is the newest eatery to be completed following the hotel's spring 2014 opening. The Moroccan restaurant is headed by Meryam Diane leading an all-female team. 

The Spa by Clarins is a 3,500 square-metre elegant retreat of signature treatments and hammam

The Kids Club is ridiculously chic, with designer wallpaper and Tataouine details

The Spa by Clarins is a chic retreat from the heat of the day; an understated white space with luxe gold touches throughout. Signature treatments take place in silent rooms, the only soundtrack distant bird call. 

The indoor pool has a fruit juice bar, and there is a dedicated ladies area with hammam and sauna with cascade shower. The spa offers beauty treatments and a nail bar by OPI, and hair salon and barber with products by Leonor Greyl Paris.

Between the spa, state-of-the-art fitness centre facilities, and supersized main pool that curves like a river around the manicured gardens, adults are more than catered for. 

The children won't be disappointed though: A super-chic Kids Club features palm tree wallpaper, Tataouine details and ombre turquoise walls. They'll be entertained for hours with traditional costume for dressing up, arts and crafts, mini tennis courts, stargazing telescopes, and a children's pool.
