Climbers face an array of risks when scaling Mount Everest - from freezing temperatures to altitude sickness - and now a scientist has found one that could leave more lasting effects.

Scottish radiation expert Bob Kerr climbed the Nepalese mountain and, with help from his guide, recorded exposure levels at its summit using a Geiger counter.

The 36-year-old found that the high-altitudes expose climbers to an extra 1milliSievert (mSv) of radiation, which is five times more than the average annual exposure in a nuclear power plant.

The radiation comes from cosmic rays from space and Kerr found the mountain exposes climbers to 1milliSievert (mSv) of radiation - five times more than annual exposure in a nuclear power plant

Last month, scientists gained insights into the molecular process of how some people get Type II diabetes, which could lead to new ways of preventing people getting the condition.

The research, led by the University of Southampton and UCL, took place on Mount Everest and assessed the mechanisms at which low oxygen levels in the body - known as hypoxia - are linked with the development of insulin resistance.

The research found that several markers of insulin resistance were increased following sustained exposure (six to eight weeks) to hypoxia at high altitude, and that this change was related to increased blood levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.

Kerr, a radiation protection adviser from Portskerra, Sutherland, took on the challenge in May 2013.

He reached a height of 26,000ft (7,925m) before temporarily losing sight in his right eye due to a lack of oxygen.

His Nepalese guide, Dorje Khatri, then took the equipment to the summit at 29,000ft (8,839m) to record the readings.

The radiation levels at the top of the mountain are caused by cosmic rays from space, but despite the risks, Kerr told the Society for Radiological Protection that no-one has ever died as a result of the radiation. 

The chances of developing fatal cancer as a result of the exposure are also low, at one in 10,000.

The chances of developing fatal cancer as a result of exposure on Mount Everest are low, at one in 10,000, but Kerr said if someone received the same level of dose at ground level at a nuclear plant, stock image of the Dungeness B nuclear power station in Kent is pictured, it would be classed as a 'significant dose'

However, Kerr said that if someone received the same level of dose at ground level, and it was not due to cosmic radiation, then under the UK's Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 the exposure would be classed as a 'significant dose' and would be at the annual public dose limit.

'When chatting about my career in radiation protection I find that climbers, despite participating happily in one of the world’s potentially hazardous hobbies, share the general public’s emotional fear of radiation,' said Kerr.

‘They don't realise that as they ascend into the heavens their exposure to natural background radiation from outer space - cosmic rays - increases.’

Last month, an avalanche killed 16 local 
guides, including Khatri, as they helped a film crew from the Discovery Channel climb the mountain.

The avalanche hit the Khumbu Icefall on April 18 and was the deadliest day in the mountain's history.

It brought the total death toll up to 265 
from almost 7,000 summit attempts and climbs have been suspended out of respect for the dead.
