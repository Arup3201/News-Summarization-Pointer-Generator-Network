Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, who won a second term in the U.S. House two weeks ago, has given birth to a daughter.

Duckworth gave birth to Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey on Tuesday and the lawmaker's office made the announcement yesterday. 

Abigail is Duckworth's first child. The birth came a few weeks before her due date of December 5.

Good news: Iraq veteran and Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, pictured left, and right with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey, has given birth to her first child, a girl she has named Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey

In a statement reported by the Chicago-Tribune Duckworth said: 'My husband Bryan and I are thrilled to announce that we are the proud parents of a baby girl. 

'Abigail O'kalani Bowlsbey was born on Nov. 18. Bryan and I were deeply honored that Senator Akaka acted as Hawaiian elder and selected her middle name.'

Daniel Akaka, a Democrat, served as a senator from Hawaii until 2013.

Duckworth met her husband Bryan Bowlsbey at George Washington University and married him in 1993. He is a Major in the National Guard. 

The 46-year-old Iraq veteran, who lost both of her legs and suffered serious injuries to her right arm while serving in 2004, was born in Thailand and spent part of her youth in Hawaii where she graduated from McKinley High School.  

Service: Duckworth is pictured serving with the Illinois Army National Guard during her tour of duty in Iraq. In 2004, she lost both legs when the helicopter she was in was shot down on a mission near Baghdad

Her mother is Thai and her late father was American.

Duckworth announced her pregnancy on NBC's 'Today' show in September saying she and her husband, a major with the National Guard Bureau, had used assisted reproductive technology in order for her to conceive.

The newborn's earlier-than-expected arrival caps off a successful month. She was a second term in congress on November 12.

In October it was announced that Duckworth, a lieutenant colonel in the Illinois Army National Guard, was retiring from the military.

Duckworth was flying a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq on November 12, 2004 when she was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade, losing both of her legs and shattering her right arm.

After returning to the U.S. and learning how to walk with the help of prosthetics, she worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs between 2006 and 2009. She was elected to Congress in 2012.

Duckworth is the first disabled female veteran and the first female Asian American from Illinois to serve in the House.

She is also one of five female veterans who lost limbs in Iraq and, coincidentally, four of them are pregnant or recently gave birth.

Melissa Stockwell, who lost most of her left leg from a roadside bomb in 2004 before going on to compete in the 2008 Paralympics, also appeared on the show. Her son is due in November.

'Tammy and I as being lower limb amputees I think very initially wondered if it would be possible to have children and learned pretty quickly you can still have children and provide, but I think you have to find yourself first,' Stockwell said.

They appeared on the show beside Dawn Halfaker, who lost an arm in Iraq, and who is now mother to a four-month-old boy.

Then finally, Danielle Green-Byrd, who lost an arm during combat in 2004 before helping vets with PTSD, gave birth to a son 10 days ago. 

'These women were there for me as the band of sisters when I went through the greatest pain, the greatest trauma in my life,' Duckworth said. 'And now we get to be together for the time of greatest joy.'
