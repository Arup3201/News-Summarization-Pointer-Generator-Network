Unfair advantage? Natalie Gumede with her dance partner Artem Chigvintsev

While others in the competition have two left feet, it would seem one Strictly contestant is a cut above the rest.

But as actress Natalie Gumede emerged as the favourite to win this weekend, outraged viewers declared themselves unimpressed to learn that she had had a professional dance background.

Many of them took to social networking site Twitter to complain that her previous training had given her an ‘unfair advantage’.

The 29-year-old Coronation Street star received a wave of criticism from viewers with some even saying her points were ‘void’ because she was not a beginner.

Shortly after signing for the BBC 1 show it emerged Miss Gumede was listed as ‘highly skilled’ dancer on her agency CV and worked professionally until she suffered an injury aged 19.

The actress was previously credited for her abilities in cabaret, contralto, jazz dancing, Latin American and tap dancing, having started training at the tender age of four.

But despite being upfront about her dance background many viewers branded Miss Gumede ‘miles in front’ of the other remaining contestants.

On Twitter one viewer, calling themselves Pebbles, posted: ‘Why is everyone saying how good Natalie is? She used to dance professionally until she 19. Unfair advantage.’

And Andy Lloyd tweeted: ‘Natalie Gumede winds me up on Strictly, she’s a trained dancer and shouldn’t be doing it… She’s miles in front. Unfair.’ 

Touching on Miss Gumede’s theatre background, one fan, calling themselves Sybil Disobedience said: ‘I’m trying to be a better person. I will *not* take against Natalie because she’s a stage school grad with a clear advantage.’

On Saturday evening it was ‘love week’ on Strictly Come Dancing and the second live show of the series since the launch on September 14.

Miss Gumede and her professional dance partner Artem Chigvintsev, 31, performed an impressive rumba which resulted in the couple topping the leader board with a score of 36 out of a possible 40 points.

Wearing a sparkly blue dress, Miss Gumede enthralled judges Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Lenn Goodman with her sensual routine to Rihanna’s ‘Love the way you lie.’

Trained: It emerged shortly after she signed up to the show that Miss Gumede started dancing aged four

Miss Gumede, who played Kirsty Soames in Coronation Street, graduated from Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in 2003. Her dance teacher said she was 'always top of the class'

However audiences branded the couple’s high score of all ‘nines’ from the four judges as an obvious reflection of her stage school background.

Adele Poultney posted online: ‘Can’t stand Natalie she is obviously a highly trained dancer!’

Another frustrated Strictly fan Dave Jones added: ‘Natalie is like one of those annoying girls from school who bangs on about how difficult they find things, but still get straight As.’

Miss Gumede, who played Kirsty Soames in ITV soap Coronation Street, graduated from Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in 2003.

Prior to her London training she trained from the age of four with dance teacher Susan Chippendale, who is now retired, in her home town in Lancashire.

Speaking about her training yesterday, dance teacher Susan Chippendale, 66, told how she was always ‘top of the class’ and won competitions performing in dance festivals as a child.

She said: ‘Her mum started taking her to my dance classes when she was only four, she just wanted to dance.

‘She was one of my best tap dancers – it’s all about rhythm and alertness.

Outrage: Viewers berated the 'favourite to win' on Twitter for her experience in five styles of dance

Success: The pair received straight nines from the judges on Saturday night, topping the leaderboard

‘She got very high marks in her final tap exams, and she used to do a lot of solo dances at festivals around the country when she was 11 or 12.

‘She stayed with me until she went to the Italia Conti school, obviously if you’ve danced before, your brain is used to telling your feet what to do.

‘However usually in this competition they’re not all total novices so I don’t think it’s fair to have a go at Natalie.

‘I hope she goes a long way in this year’s show – I just hope the public keep voting the right way!’

Mrs Chippendale retired from teaching dance six years ago and her dance school has closed down.

Stragglers: Miss Gumede is far from the bottom two like fellow celebrities Julien Macdonald and Vanessa Feltz

Despite the controversy Strictly Come Dancing is still proving popular with TV viewers. Saturday night’s live show drew an audience of 9.8 million.

At its peak the BBC dance competition received 10.9 million viewers beating ITV’s first live X Factor show which at peak only received an audience of 9.2 million.

Strictly Come Dancing, hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, is currently in its eleventh series and features celebrities with professional dance partners competing in Ballroom and Latin dances.

Last night Radio 2 DJ Vanessa Feltz and professional partner James Jordan became the second couple to be voted off the show.

The pair were in the dance off with fashion designer Julien Macdonald and his American partner Janette Manrara.
