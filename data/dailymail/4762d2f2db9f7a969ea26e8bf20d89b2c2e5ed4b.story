Hallelujah! Another Leonard Cohen biography! A remarkable number of books have been written about the old groaner, once lovingly known to British music critics as ‘Laughing Len’.

But there are two good reasons for this. One is the lyrics: opaque, complex, redemptive, capable of endless interpretation and reinterpretation. Critics love all that.

The other is the wonderful shape of his late-flowering career.

Hats off to Laughing Len: Musician Leonard Cohen is loved for his ability to talk off the cuff

Inducted into the Canadian Hall of Fame in 1991, he said: ‘If I had been given this attention when I was 26, it would have turned my head. At 36 it might have confirmed my flight on a rather morbid spiritual path. At 46 it would have rubbed my nose in my failing powers and have prompted a plotting of a getaway and an alibi. But at 56 — hell, I’m just hitting my stride and it doesn’t hurt at all.’

A third reason might be this: who couldn’t love a man who can talk like that off the cuff?

Cohen (pictured) will be 80 in September and has never been more popular. His recent live performances, which only began because his former manager had hopped off with all his money, have been a revelation and a delight.

And Hallelujah, a song from an album his record company originally turned down, has become one of the most covered songs of the past decade, although as Liel Leibovitz points out, most of the singers who attempt it misinterpret it.

‘The song tends to inspire the sort of cascade of crescendos that causes inexperienced and dramatic singers to shut their eyes tightly and clench their fists as they belt out verse after verse. Overcome by emotion, they take the song to be about the hallelujah of the orgasm.’

Cohen, says Leibovitz, has none of that. He always sings it simply (as he sings everything) because the words are what count, not the performance. When an interviewer told him that Hallelujah conveyed  a sense of holiness, Cohen wanted to talk about ritual instead.

‘I understand that they forgot how to build the arch for several hundred years,’ he said. ‘Masons forgot how to build certain kinds of arches, it was lost. So it is in our time that certain spiritual mechanisms that were very useful have been abandoned and forgot. Redemption, repentance, resurrection.

‘All those ideas are thrown out with the bathwater. People become suspicious of religion plus all these redemptive mechanisms that are very useful.’

One wonders what Alexandra Burke, who won  The X Factor with an atrocious, grandstanding version of the song, would make of that. Not a lot, I would imagine.

Flawed hero: Cohen is best known for his song 'Hallelujah' which has become one of the most covered songs of the decade

Liel Leibovitz is a youngish American academic, and his book is rather more intellectually rigorous than most rock biographies. Cohen’s love life is famously ragged, but Leibovitz isn’t interested in gossip. What he’s after are the philosophical and theological bases of Cohen’s art.

He is fascinated by the young man’s struggle, for Cohen was in his mid-30s before he even recorded a note. Canadian, Jewish and not very tall, he never ceased to feel like an outsider.

Whatever was going on in popular culture never seemed to have much to do with him. In the late 1960s, for instance, psychedelia was mutating  into blues rock, and thence into progressive and glam rock. Only Leonard Cohen was sitting alone with his guitar, singing long, slow, highly literary laments to lost love and the meaningless horror of modern existence.

He emerges from the book as something of a hero, flawed as we all are, complex as very few of us are, and not just looking for answers but actually finding some. He’s Laughing Len now, for real.
