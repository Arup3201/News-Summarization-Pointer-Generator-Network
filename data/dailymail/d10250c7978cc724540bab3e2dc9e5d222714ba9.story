These moodily atmospheric shots of shooting steam and bubbling liquid could have been taken on the moon or some far flung planet, at the very least  the set of a sci-fi film.

Instead they were captured in Iceland by French  photographer Alban Henderyckx during a trip near Vatnajökull.

Vatnajökull, also known as the Vatna Glacier, is the largest and most voluminous Icelandic glacier, and one of the largest in area in Europe. It is located in the south-east of the island, covering more than eight per cent of the country.

French photographer Alban Henderyckx took these pictures of highland geysers during a trip near Vatnajökull in Iceland

Vatnajökull, also known as the Vatna Glacier, is the largest and most voluminous Icelandic glacier, and one of the largest in area in Europe 

The 30 year old landscape photographer says, 'Wandering somewhere in the inland of the Iceland, it must have been around 24 hours I was awake. Surrounded by a thick fog, I was driving on the chaotic desert trails of Highlands.'

All his images are from a single RAW file and processed using Lightroom, a software program. Online reviewers have been quick to praise his pictures. Ellen Kostad Empson said, 'All I can say is wow' and Yanay Tsabary added, 'He's creating art.'

A geyser is a vent in Earth's surface that periodically ejects a column of hot water and steam

The most famous geyser is in Yellowstone National Park in the US and is called Old Faithful which erupts every 60 to 90 minutes

A geyser is a vent in Earth's surface that periodically ejects a column of hot water and steam. Some geysers have eruptions that blast thousands of gallons of boiling hot water up to a few hundred feet in the air. 

The most famous geyser is in Yellowstone National Park in the US and is called Old Faithful which erupts every 60 to 90 minutes and blasts  hot water up to 200 feet into the air.

Alban seeks to immerse himself 'in a world without artifice, nature and the vastness of the landscape'

Explaining his work, Alban says, 'I instinctively followed the energy of my subconscious to immerse myself more in a world without artifice, nature and the vastness of the landscape'
