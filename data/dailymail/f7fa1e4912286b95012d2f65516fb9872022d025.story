Nasa has revealed the incredible moments in a specially set up 'war room' inside its HQ as its Curiosity rover landed on the red planet.

The unprecedented insight reveals the drama the 34 scientists allowed into the inner sanctum, which was separate from mission control, went through during Curiosity's descent to the surface of the red planet.

It even reveals the carefully chosen words that signified a perfect landing - tango delta nominal.

Curiosity's Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) 'war room' and its staff. On the night of Aug. 5, 2012 PDT (early morning Aug. 6 EDT), 34 engineers gathered in this room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, to support the landing

Twenty-five of Nasa's engineers are pictured above.

From the left, back row, they are: Luis Dominguez, Armen Toorian, Allen Kummer, Dan Scharf, Jaime Catchen, Chuck Baker, Nadin Cox, Matt, Lenda, Steve Lee, Genevie Yang and Richard Kornfeld at the end.

Starting from the top of the table and moving left are: Paul Brugarolas, Lynn McGrew, Aaron Stehura, Steve Sell, Devin Kipp, Jeremy Shidner, Corey Harmon and David Way.

In the closest row, from the left, are: Matt Rozek, Ravi Prakash, Dick Powell, Jody Davis, Gavin Mendeck and Jordi Casoliva.

"If we said 'touchdown,' then people not intimately familiar with EDL 
might infer that Curiosity was good to go," said  Steve Sell, a 42-year-old engineer from Gettysburg, said on Nasa's web site.

He admits the touchdown was the first of three key message the team hoped to hear.

'Two more 
major calls had to be made before I could begin to breathe again.'

The key moment for the team occured at 10:32 p.m local time.

Diaries from the crew reveal there had been a debate amongst Curiosity's entry, descent and landing team about what their first words to indicate that the rover had reached the surface should be.

The team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory knew their microphones would be 'hot' and that NASA TV was beaming the landing event out live to anybody with the desire and wherewithal to watch.

They also knew that landing safely on Mars meant more than simply landing on Mars - which any one of the 34 engineers present at JPL's Building 264 Room 230, also known as the 'EDL War Room,' will tell you at great length is not simple at all.

Their rocket-propelled backpack and rover-lowering Sky Crane system were getting their first test 154 million miles (248 million kilometers) away from home.

At 10:31:45 p.m. PDT, Jody Davis saw the event record, or EVR, she was looking for appear on her computer screen in the EDL War Room.

She told Nasa's site she knew that the 'Touchdown' message would only be beamed down if the rover's descent stage had throttled down, a result which could only occur if the descent stage had offloaded half its weight.

The only way the rover could offload half its weight in an instant is if it were being held up from below.

Davis, a member of the EDL team and an engineer from NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia, gave the much reviewed, pre-scripted call - 'Tango Delta nominal.'

Tango and Delta are phonetic identifiers for T and D, which the team used to represent touchdown.

The next call the EDL team was looking for was 'RIMU Stable.'

'RIMU stands for Rover Inertial Measurement Unit,' said Sell.

'The RIMU gives us the rover's orientation as well as any movement it is making.

'If we landed on a crumbling crater wall or an unstable sand dune, or were being dragged by a still-connected descent stage across the surface, then the RIMU would show that in its data set.'

The War Room's David Way, an engineer from JPL, was monitoring that unit's performance.

Eight long seconds after Jody's call, he found the EVR he was looking for.

'RIMU Stable," said Way.

The final confirmation actually came from a different building, Nasa said.

There, in the Mission Support Area of JPL's Building 230, Adam Steltzner, the mission's EDL phase lead, was staring across the room at Brian Schwartz, who was not making eye contact with anyone.

Schwartz, the EDL communications engineer, was staring at his screen.

Final destination: Curisity recently sent back this high resolution picture of its landing site and its destination, called Mount Sharp, in the distance.

His task was not to check for a good-news EVR from the rover. Instead, he was waiting to see if the UHF signal became intermittent, faded away or just cut out altogether - all potential indications that the rover and descent stage had not gone their separate ways.

Eight seconds after the RIMU call - Schwartz looked up.

'UHF strong,' said Schwartz.

With that, Steltzner had all the data he needed. Seated directly in front of the pacing EDL Phase Lead, Allen Chen felt a jab in the shoulder.

Chen, the mission's (capsule communicator), knew it could only mean one thing.

'Touchdown confirmed,' said Chen.
