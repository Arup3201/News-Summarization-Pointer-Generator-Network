At Manchester City’s brand new £200million academy, an entire wall is dedicated to the young stars who have graduated to the first-team. Each one has his own disc commemorating the date of his debut. Not surprisingly, Ched Evans has been left off the list.

Evans is no longer a source of pride for City. His conviction for rape has understandably overshadowed anything he ever achieved on the football pitch.

But there is a reason why clubs like Sheffield United and now Oldham Athletic are prepared to risk their reputations and even sponsorship revenue to sign the player following his release from prison after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011: Evans is still potentially a very good player.

Evans is yet to sign with a club after serving half the term, but he could still be a very good player

The two-and-a-half years spent behind bars and time away from a professional sports environment will inevitably have taken its toll. However, at the age of 26, these clubs know that Evans could still regain his fitness and form and become a valuable asset to their teams.

Those who witnessed Evans’ progress as a young striker are well aware of his potential. Coming through the ranks at City before going out on loan to Norwich and then joining Sheffield United for £3million in 2009, he earned comparisons with a young Alan Shearer.

Standing 6ft tall, powerfully built, and quick off the mark, the Welshman had all the tools to be a top striker. He was a natural finisher, scoring 35 goals in 42 games in his last season at Sheffield United before his conviction.

But he could also lay on plenty of goals for his teammates and had the kind of awareness and anticipation that separates good strikers from average ones. He was a hard-working forward, strong in the air and more than capable of holding the ball up.

Evans emerged through the ranks at City in the days before the Abu Dhabi takeover. He was a member of the team that reached the 2006 FA Youth Cup final, and the following season scored 16 goals in 23 starts for the club’s youth team, and six in 10 starts for the reserves.

He was promoted to the first-team squad and made his debut off the bench in a Carling Cup win over Norwich in September 2007. The youngster was called up by Wales Under-21s and scored 13 goals in 12 games at that level, including hit a hat-trick against France.

Evans went out on loan to Norwich for the rest of the season and enhanced his burgeoning reputation by scoring 10 goals from 28 appearances for the Canaries.

He was one of a number of young players called up to the senior Wales squad in May 2008 along with Aaron Ramsey and Sam Vokes, and scored the winner against Iceland with a backheel just three minutes after coming off the bench. It was the first of 13 senior caps for his country.

Following the City takeover, Evans played 25 games for the club in 2008-09, scoring his only Premier League goal in a 6-0 win over Portsmouth. But when Carlos Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor, Roque Santa Cruz and Craig Bellamy arrived in the summer of 2009, he knew that first-team opportunities would be limited and stepped down to the Championship with Sheffield United despite speculation linking him with a number of other Premier League clubs and Celtic.

It was the Blades who first invited Evans to train with them following his release from prison before the invitation was withdrawn in the face of a public backlash and opposition from club patrons, sponsors and even local MPs. Hartlepool and Tranmere both rejected the chance to sign him, and now Oldham have stepped into the firing line.

Given his playing career to date and the often cynical world of football, the club’s interest in Evans should perhaps come as no surprise. Nor, however, should City’s desire to erase him from history.
