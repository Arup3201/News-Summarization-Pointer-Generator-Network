Eurosceptic Tory MPs could stand under a joint ticket with UK Independence Party,  Nigel Farage revealed today.

The UKIP leader suggested his party’s logo could appear on the ballot paper alongside Conservative candidates as a seal of approval for MPs who back his party’s position on Europe.

But he stressed that the endorsement would be done on an individual basis, ruling out an election pact unless David Cameron is replaced as leader.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested he would welcome Tory defections with open arms, as he offered the UKIP logo to Eurosceptic candidates

The Tories are embroiled in serious turmoil over the issue of Europe, and Mr Cameron’s promise to renegotiate links with Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

Mr Farage suggested the Tories have an ‘issue of trust’ after failing to deliver a vote on the Lisbon Treaty.

Mr Cameron, who is on a visit to the US, has been forced to deal with Tory Cabinet ministers saying they would vote to leave the EU if there was a referendum tomorrow, as dozens of backbenchers prepare to vote against the Queen’s Speech in an unprecedented revolt on Wednesday.

Many in Conservative ranks have been spooked by the rise of UKIP, which two weeks ago took almost one in four votes in the local elections.

It UKIP has held talks with several Tory MPs about possibly defecting before the next election.

But today Mr Farage revealed he could offer the UKIP ‘pound sign’ logo to endorse some Tory MPs at the next election.

He told BBC News: ‘The law now allows one candidate to have the logo of more than one party [on a ballot paper], so legally if someone wanted to stand as a Tory-UKIP candidate or even a Labour-UKIP candidate that would be allowed under electoral law.’

A request from a Tory MP to use the UKIP emblem would be discussed by the UKIP local association ‘and we’d go from there’, Mr Farage added.

David Cameron is in Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama, but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over Tory splits back home over Europe

Mr Farage said the Tory party will go on being ‘hopelessly split’ unless an in-out referendum is held before the 2015 election.

As a result UKIP could not do a deal with Mr Cameron in charge.

‘I think the dam has broken. I think the politics that dare not speak its name has now become mainstream and you’re going to see a lot more voices coming out over the next few months saying that the time has come for us to leave.

‘Nobody could do a deal with a party that is completely spilt and it’s difficult to ascertain what its position is.

‘I’ve said all the way through that if someone like a Boris [Johnson] or a Michael Gove was leading the Conservative party we’d certainly be prepared to have a conversation. Please don’t think that UKIP is just here as a fringe of the Conservative party.

‘We took a lot of Labour and Lib Dem votes two weeks ago and that’s something in this debate that tends to get forgotten.’
