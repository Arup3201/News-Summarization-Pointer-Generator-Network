With Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona completed, Rickie Lambert could be set to take on the mantle of Liverpool's famous number seven shirt.

But the question now is whether he can emulate Luis Suarez and earn the right to be mentioned in the same breath as others who have worn Liverpool's iconic number seven.

The Uruguayan, for all his unsavoury antics, produced some phenomenal performances for Liverpool, culminating in his Player of the Year awards last season.

So who else makes our list of Liverpool's greatest number sevens?

Striking power: Lambert showed his goalscoring ability at Southampton and will want to emulate Suarez

Kevin Keegan 1971-1977

The first of Liverpool's great sevens, and the man who made the number special.

Keegan was signed in 1971, and formed a lethal strike partnership with John Toshak before moving to Hamburg in 1977.

In his six years at the club Keegan won the league three times, scored over 100 goals, and led Liverpool to the European Cup.

His first goal came 12 minutes into his debut. His last match sealed the European title for the club. For the early 1970s he was the iconic leader of Liverpool's line and still considered by many to be their greatest striker.

Keegan would go on to be the first English winner of the Ballon D'or since Bobby Charlton, receiving the award in 1978 and '79.

Kenny Dalglish 1977-1987

Filling the hole left behind by Keegan's move to Hamburg was never going to be easy, but Kenny Dalglish's arrival from Celtic did just that.

Possibly Liverpool's greatest ever player, Dalglish played over 500 times for the club scoring 169 goals.

At the end of his first season with the club King Kenny scored the only goal in the European Cup final, and his decade playing for the club produced six league titles.

As both a player and a manager Dalglish was a Liverpool hero, and ensured the legend of the number seven lived on.

Peter Beardsley 1987-1991

A similar type of player to Dalglish, although rarely mentioned with the same expressions of awe by Liverpool fans.

Two titles in his four years at the club was an excellent return, and his first season on Merseyside saw him play an important part in one of the great Liverpool sides.

He was denied the European glory of his predecessors by the ban on English clubs from European football, but Beardsley deserves to be remembered as part of the number 7 tradition.

Steve McManaman 1990-1999

The only man on this list to have come through the Liverpool youth system to wear the number seven shirt, Mcmanaman was a key member of the squad throughout the 1990s.

While he may not match the likes of Keegan and Dalglish in terms of trophies, McManaman provided pace and flair in a team far below the standard of the previous decades.

Dribbler: McManaman brought flair to the declining Liverpool side of the 1990s

His successes for Liverpool, more often as a provider than a goalscorer, earned a move to Real Madrid

The winger was never really able to throw off his 'Spice Boys' tag as the Liverpool team in the mid-90s grew a reputation for the wrong reasons, but on the pitch he was a star for the right reasons.

Goals and assists were plentiful, and earned him a move to Real Madrid, where he scored in the 2000 Champions League final.

His 142 assists in his nine years for Liverpool remains a remarkable statistic, and he was always more the supplier than the goalscorer.

Luis Suarez 2011-2014

The first player in 
Premier League history to claim three hat-tricks against the same club 
when he scored a treble against Norwich in December 2013, Suarez has come the closest to making the duo of Keegan and Dalglish a trinity.

The previous wearers of the red cloth did not provoke anywhere near the controversy that has followed the forward around.

Racist abuse, the biting incidents and the on-off transfer saga have all added spice to the story.

Now that he has departed to Barcelona, his time at Liverpool can be fully evaluated.

Free-kicks that fizz into the net, little chips over the goalkeeper...for the neutral it has been a privilege to witness - on the pitch at least.

The
 only thing is, Messers Keegan and Dalglish carry the mantle of 
greatness because of a level of brilliance that was sustained over a 
number of years.

Happier times: Suarez propelled Liverpool to within touching distance of their first Premier League title

Controversy: Suarez's antics, and his relatively short spell, mean he will not be remembered as the greatest number seven, but on the pitch he earned the right to be mentioned alongside Keegan and Dalglish

World Class: Suarez's performances last season led to comparisons with Ronaldo and Messi

That longevity is something that the most recent incumbent chose not to replicate.

His
 move means that Suarez will never achieve the long-term success of 
those two greats, but his contribution since 2011 suggests he is 
certainly able to be mentioned in the same breath.

And, given the achievements and contribution made by both Keegan and Dalglish, that's surely high praise indeed.
