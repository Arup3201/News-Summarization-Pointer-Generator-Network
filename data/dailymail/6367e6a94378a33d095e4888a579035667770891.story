Hate: Bill Clinton allegedly hates Barack Obama and this animosity stems from accusations of racism against the former president during Obama's 2008 defeat of Hillary Clinton

The simmering cauldron of hatred that exists between the Obamas and the Clintons threatens to explode in a volcanic eruption that could threaten all Democrat chances in 2016, says a sensational new book.

Despite their much-vaunted public truce, journalist Edward Klein claims in 'Blood Feud' that Bill Clinton despises President Obama and that Michelle refers to Hillary behind closed doors as the 'Hildebeest'.

The animosity between the Democratic Party's two power couples has reached such intensity that Klein says the president is willing to renege on his promise to endorse Hillary for 2016 and has teased the Clintons with suggestions that Michelle would be a strong candidate for the Oval Office.

Dating back to then Senator Obama's defeat of Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic nomination they believed was theirs, Bill has never forgiven Obama for allegations he made during that bitter campaign.

'I hate that man Obama more than any man I've ever met, more than any man who ever lived,' said Bill Clinton to a friend after Obama suggested he was a racist in 2008 according to Klein's book, excerpts of which appear in The New York Post.

Indeed, despite President Obama bringing Hillary into his cabinet as Secretary of State after his storming victory in 2008, her presence only proved to antagonize relations between the two couples.

Gossip and teasing: According to Edward Klein, Michelle Obama likes to make fun of Hillary Clinton over a glass of wine at the end of the day

No love lost; Despite having her in his cabinet as Secretary of State, President Clinton is wavering over his endorsement of Hillary Clinton (both seen here in 2011) for the 2016 nomination

According to an account of Klein's explosive allegations in The New York Post, Michelle Obama would sit in the evenings with her trusted adviser, Valerie Jarrett to gossip and make fun of Hillary over a bottle of Chardonnay.

They nicknamed Hillary the 'Hildebeest', in reference to the ugly and sturdy gnu that is often seen wandering the Serengeti.

In the run up to the 2012 election, President Obama's campaign team advised the sitting president that he needed to utilize the sure-touch of Bill Clinton if he wanted to secure a second term.

Loathe to do this, President Obama finally asked the former president to play a round of golf with him in September 2011, to ask for his help.

'I’m not going to enjoy this,' Bill told Hillary according to Klein.

'I’ve had two successors since I left the White House — Bush and Obama — and I’ve heard more from Bush, asking for my advice, than I’ve heard from Obama. I have no relationship with the president — none whatsoever,' Clinton said.

'I really can’t stand the way Obama ­always seems to be hectoring when he talks to me.

'Sometimes we just stare at each other. It’s pretty damn awkward. Now we both have favors to ask each other, and it’s going to be very unpleasant. But I’ve got to get this guy to owe me and to be on our side.'

The golf game was petty, tetchy and not without incident.

President Clinton
 immediately tried to claim the upper hand by reminding Obama that he 
presided over an economic golden age, while Obama was struggling to 
affect any change during the Great Recession.

Hammering
 home his point, Bill Clinton told President Obama that obviously he and Hillary 
would be running for president in 2016 and that his wife would be 'the 
most qualified, most experienced candidate, perhaps in history.'

This rankled with President Obama, acutely aware of any attacks on his relative inexperience on walking into the White House.

'And
 so Bill continued to talk about Hillary’s qualifications . . . and the 
coming campaign in 2016,' writes Klein as featured in The New York Post.

Deal: According to Edward Klein, Bill Clinton agreed to fully campaign for Barack Obama on the proviso he supported his wife in 2016

'But
 Barack didn’t bite. He changed the subject several times. Then 
suddenly, Barack said something that took Bill by complete surprise. He 
said, ‘You know, Michelle would make a great presidential candidate, 
too.’

'Bill was speechless. Was Barack comparing Michelle’s qualifications to Hillary’s?

'Bill
 said that if he hadn’t been on a mission to strike a deal with Barack, 
he might have stormed off the golf course then and there.'

A deal was struck nonetheless. Bill delivered a barnstorming speech to the Democratic National Convention, which threatened to upstage the president himself.

However, the Clintons both felt that the president was wavering in his commitment to endorse Hillary for 2016 as his side of the bargain.

In an effort to smooth over the rising tensions, the Obamas hosted the Clintons on March 1, 2013 at a dinner - the day that the $85billion 'sequester' budget cuts went into effect.

The meal could go down as the moment that all bets were off in the two couple's political marriage of necessity.

According to Klein, who spoke to those with knowledge of the dinner, Bill couldn't help hectoring the president about his handling of the economy.

Hillary, attempting to change the subject asked Michelle if it was true she might copy her and run as a Senator, in Illinois, after her husband left office.

Michelle demurred to answer and allegedly Bill was stunned that Hillary would have shown her hand so openly. The back-and-forth between the four grew steadily more icy.

Tetchy: The two Democrats endure an icy relationship which is not helped by their enduring animosity towards each other

Bill suggested that the president turn over his much-vaunted social media enabled campaign know-how to the Democratic party at large.

'You have to use your organization to aid the candidate in 2016,' Bill pressed Obama.

'Really?' replied a sarcastic Obama, according to Klein.

Things deteriorated as President Clinton continued to lecture the table as the president began to ignore his guests and check his Blackberry.

According to Klein, Hillary tried to change the subject again and asked if Barack Obama was happy he wouldn't have to campaign again, especially because he didn't seem to like it.

'For a guy who doesn’t like it,' Obama replied, 'I’ve done pretty well.'

Marriage of necessity: The Clintons fear that the Obamas will renege on their promise to support Hillary in 2016 

'Well,' Bill said according to Klein in The New York Post, 'I was glad to pitch in and help get you re-elected.'

The after-effects of that meal are still being felt.

The Clintons have become convinced that Obama will not back Hillary for 2016 and that he is seeking to endorse Vice-President Joe Biden or a new, young politician, just like he was.

'He’s convinced himself he’s been a brilliant president, and wants to clone himself — to find his Mini-Me,' says Bill Clinton to Chelsea according to Klein.

'He’s hunting for someone to succeed him, and he believes the American people don’t want to vote for someone who’s been around for a long time. He thinks that your mother and I are what he calls "so 20th century". He’s looking for ­another Barack Obama.'
