With his sporting prowess and undeniable good looks, David Beckham is widely regarded as one of the most desirable men in the world.

But what would he look like if he didn't have the luxury of all the grooming products and stylists that fame brings with it?

One company decided to 
look into what some of the
 biggest celebrities would look look like if they hadn’t found fame - 
and the team of hair stylists, make-up artists, cosmetic surgeons and 
fashion consultants that come with the package.

What would Victoria say? International sex symbol David Beckham has been treated to a make-under by a team of experts who wanted to see what celebrities would look like if they hadn't found fame

The design 
team created some concept images 
using existing pictures of a selection of celebrities showing 
what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world and the results are hilarious and ridiculous in equal measure.

The best makeunder of the bunch is 
undoubtedly 38-year-old David Beckham. With his fluffy hair, bushy unkempt beard and furrowed brow, David looks more like a loveable and rugged hillbilly than an international sex symbol.

Can you beliebe this? Without his trademark quiff and million dollar bling, teen heartthrob Justin Bieber is akin to a small alien

Not so super: Cara Delevingne has been stripped of her model makeover and looks like your average girl next door rather than a world-famous model

Teen heartthrob Justin Bieber too has been treated to a 'unbeliebable' transformation. Without his diamond earrings, quaffed quiff and Hollywood smile, the 19-year-old popstar resembles a tiny alien.

Complete with a giant afro and more natural beauty look, superstar Beyonce looks more like her less famous sister Solange Knowles in her make-over.

Supermodel Cara Delevingne has also been given a makeunder and is shown with blotchy skin (perhaps from all the partying), chapped lips and badly-dyed hair.

Not so flawless: Without her perfectly styled locks and impeccable make-up, Queen Bey wouldn't be Crazy In Love with this look

What a poker face! Lady Gaga, known for her eccentric style, looks like an average 20-something without her 
ice-blonde hair and heavy make-up

Speaking about the project, 
www.vouchercodespro.co.uk, who helped create the images, said: 'Have you
 ever caught yourself in the middle of a daydream wondering how you 
would look if you had millions in the bank and an endless amount of 
fashion and beauty help at your fingertips?

'No
 wonder the A-listers all look so perfect when you take into the account
 the ridiculously long list of people whose job it is to make the 
Hollywood elite look effortless whilst they walk up and down the red 
carpet.

'This time around, we decided to 
focus on some of the most famous A-listers in the world, and the 
elements of their image that signify their international fame.

'Examples
 of this included reducing Cara Delevingne and her prominent eyebrows, 
as well as highlighting how David Beckham would look if he embraced the 
more rugged look of a beard and scruffy hair.

'Lady
 Gaga was indeed a tricky one, we attempted to emphasize how she may 
look with less make-up and a plain, brunette hairstyle, although I’m not
 sure if that woman could ever look normal if she tried!'

Just your average girl: The same design team decided to
 create what they think Kim Kardashian would look like if she wasn't 
famous - and the result went viral

Not such a bad gal now: Rihanna looks fresh-faced and innocent in the design team's 'non famous' version of the singer

Sharon, is that you? Mrs O, who has admitted to 
having plastic surgery, looks much older with her grey hair and winkles 
in the images

Taking it too far: The design team focused on 
features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been 
professionally worked on, such as Tom Cruise and his perfect teeth

Haggered: Nicholas Cage, 50, looks old beyond his years in the virtually adapted image
