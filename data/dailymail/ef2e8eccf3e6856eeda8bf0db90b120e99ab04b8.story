Yugoslavia legend Dragan Stojkovic aims to follow his close friend Arsene Wenger from managing in Japan to taking charge in the Premier League.

Stojkovic played under Arsenal's current manager at Nagoya Grampus in the nineties and went onto manage the Japanese side himself, winning their first ever J-League title in 2010.

Wenger has admitted in the past he sees Stojkovic, who is currently out of work after his six-year spell in charge of Grampus ended last year, as a possible replacement at the Emirates when he eventually retires.

Dragan Stojkovic, on the touchline during his time at Nagoya Grampus, aims to manage in the Premier League

'I respect English football very much and the Premier League is an incredible league,' he told talkSPORT.

'Of course [I would like to manage in the Premier League]. Why not? I believe I have enough knowledge about modern football to be part of the development of English football.

'I have had a few meetings [with English clubs] but I am still waiting for a good offer.'

Stojkovic is a Yugoslavia legend from his playing days, scoring 15 goals in 84 games, spanning over 18 years

The Serbian claims, having worked with Wenger, that he shares an almost identical footballing philosophy.

'Arsene Wenger is a friend of mine and that relationship and friendship exists from 1995,' added Stojkovic.

'If you remember how he changed Arsenal, the way they play, the style and the quality, this is the same style I used in the last six years, and Grampus became champions for the first time in their history thanks to that work.

'It is my objective to teach players to play in an attacking style and to give pleasure to the fans.'
