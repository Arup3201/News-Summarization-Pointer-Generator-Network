This irritable giraffe was clearly not in the mood for a close-up.

And the angry animal made his feelings known to cyclist Louise John Rex, by stomping on his £2,000 bicycle.

Louise and friend Ryk van Niekerk were travelling by bike across the Groenkloof Nature Reserve in Pretoria, South Africa.

They spotted the 18-foot animal grazing nearby and didn't want to miss out on such a rare photo opportunity.

Using a mobile phone, Louise first took a picture of Ryk before the duo swapped round.

And it would seem the creature took a particular dislike to Louise - stomping on the cyclist's expensive mountain bike.

He said: 'I had to jump off my bike immediately - there was no time to drive away.' 

Ready to chase: Louise returns to assess the damage to his bike, but the giraffe has other ideas

'I met him as we came to a steep incline drove up when the animal suddenly appeared in the aisle in front of me.

'He had a friend with him, but that quickly disappeared into the bushes. I waited for him to walk away, but he came closer. The giraffe was quite fast.' 

'He has long legs and in what seems like just a step he can be right on top of you.'

Spotted: The cyclist sees the giraffe coming towards him and reaches for his damaged bike

Getaway: Louise picks up his bike and moves out of the animal's way

Once the giraffe had trampled the bicycle, he began chasing Louise after the cyclist tried to rescue his bike.

Louise said: 'Just when I pick up my bike, he turned and started chasing me around the trees. He was clearly very irritated.

The animal completely destroyed the bike, leaving poor Louise with a two-mile walk back to his car.

Remarkably, Louise has also previously been chased by an ostrich in the reserve.
