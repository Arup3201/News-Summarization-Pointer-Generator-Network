Undercover sting: In 2001 the Countess of Wessex, pictured last week, was forced to say sorry to royals and politiocians after she was recorded making 'horribly indiscreet' comments by the NotW

A senior royal was forced to write a series of grovelling apologies after she was recorded making 'horribly indiscreet' comments about her family, including allegedly calling the Queen 'the old dear', it emerged today.

Rebekah Brooks told the Old Bailey phone hacking trial that Sophie Countess of Wessex was forced to give an interview to the News of the World after she made rude remarks to the 'Fake Sheikh'.

Prince Edward's wife was targeted by investigative reporter Mazher Mahmood 
worked on a tip-off via Max Clifford that her PR company was 
selling access to the royal family in 2001, the court heard.

In the sting it was alleged the Countess made
 indiscreet, and often rude, references to the late Diana, Princess of 
Wales, the Queen Mother, Tony and Cherie Blair and William Hague during a
 lengthy conversation Mahmood, who said he wanted to hire her PR firm.

The 'Sophie tapes' captured her apparently saying Tony Blair as being 'far too 
presidential' - while Cherie Blair was 'just horrid. Absolutely horrid, 
horrid, horrid'.

She is also said to have referred to the Queen 
as 'the old dear'. The Countess is further alleged to have told the 
bogus sheik that Charles and Camilla will marry - but not until 'the old
 lady dies'. In this instance, the Countess was referring to the Queen 
Mother.

Ms Brooks today described how the investigation into royal access for business was blown when the letters leaked out.

She said Buckingham Palace had forced the Countess to do an exclusive interview with News of the World if they dropped the embarrassing story.

Evidence: Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks told the Old Bailey today about her deal with the royals after the Countess of Wessex made disparaging comments

She
 said a former 'disgruntled' employee had approached the newspaper 
alleging that the countess and her business partner were using the royal
 connection to boost their business.

The journalist set about posing as a Sheikh in need of PR at a huge cost to the News of the World (NotW), the court was told.

There
 was laughter in the courtroom when Brooks said: 'He would live the true
 life of a wealthy Sheikh. He would have a Bentley and a penthouse 
suite. He always told me it was imperative.'

Apology: The Countess of Wessex in 2001 on the day after it emerged she make 'indiscreet' remarks to the Fake Sheikh about fellow royals and politicians

After
 the lengthy investigation, Brooks was presented with the results and 
she concluded that although it complied with the editors' code of 
conduct from the start, it had not proved the allegation that the 
Countess had personally offered access.

Brooks decided not to run the story and instead rang Buckingham Palace to make a deal.

An agreement was struck for an interview with Sophie in exchange for dumping the Fake Sheikh story.

It was the first interview since her marriage so a good deal for the paper, she said.

She told the court: 'In the meantime, the Countess of Wessex, having been told by us, had realised that during the course of trying to get Maz as a client she had been horribly indiscreet about members of the royal family and politicians and obviously remembered what she said.

'So she wrote to everybody involved. She was particularly mean about Tony Blair and Cherie, William Hague, so she wrote these letters.'

But the letters leaked out and 'became a justification for running the original story' although it was more about the embarrassing remarks, she told the court.

A story about the letters also appeared in the Mail on Sunday.

Her comments were not read to the court today but were widely reported at the time.

Brooks told the jury: 'The time in which I approached the palace and negotiated the interview and then did the interview, as the Countess of Wessex is writing letters, it is being discussed in the palace, what had happened.

'I'm assuming someone from the palace leaked this to the Mail on Sunday, but that's an assumption. If it was us and the palace that knew.'

Afterwards, Brooks wrote to the head of the investigations unit, Greg Miskiw, saying: 'We have got to learn some lessons from Sophie.

'As I said, all our entrapment and subterfuge must be justified 110 per cent. We have to (sic) so careful and make sure everything we do is inside the law.

'I know Sophie was 110% justified in every way and our methods were right and proper. We must continue this standard with all our investigations.'

Asked why she would have sent that email, Brooks told the court that there had been 'a lot of things said' about the operation that were not true.

She said: 'Because I had had particular involvement in this, I was quite cross because I felt that at every stage in the Countess of Wessex investigation we had adhered to the code and used the public interest exceptions and had behaved responsibly on the actual final decision, did we have enough of a story?'

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
