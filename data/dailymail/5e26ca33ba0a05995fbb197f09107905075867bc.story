A pregnant mother who died following a car crash saw her two newborn twins before she passed away, her devastated family has revealed.

Ashton Hughes, 19, was driving from a doctor's appointment in Spartanburg, South Carolina on Tuesday with her 11-month-old daughter Dixie when she ran into the back of a stopped SUV.

The young mother, who was seven months pregnant, was conscious after the crash but complained of pain to her abdomen and was rushed to hospital, where her twins - a boy and a girl - were born by emergency cesarean section.

Ashton Gailann Jennings, named after her mother, was born weighing 2 lb 12 oz, while Brantley Wayne Jennings was 3 lb 2 oz, The State reported.

Saved: Newborn twins Ashton Gailann Jennings and Brantley Wayne Jennings, pictured, were born on Tuesday after their mother was in a car crash. They survived but she later passed away

Tragic: Their mother, Ashton Hughes (pictured with her fiance Zack Jennings) died from her injuries following the c-section but saw the babies before she passed away. Her cause of death has not been determined

The babies are expected to stay in intensive care at Spartanburg Medical Center for the next seven or eight weeks but are expected to survive, their grandfather, Eric Hughes, said.

Ashton, who was found to have suffered internal bleeding from the crash, was able to see the twins, he said.

Her mother, Misty Fink, told WYFF that her daughter lost too much blood during the emergency delivery and passed away shortly afterwards. Her cause of death has not yet been determined.

'It just hurts my heart so bad,' Mr Hughes said. 'I wish that I could take her place any day.'

But he said that he was relieved that her babies survived, including her toddler Dixie, who was in the back of her car at the time of the crash and only suffered a few minor scrapes.

'That's the best part about this,' he said. 'I'm thankful for them being here, but totally saddened by her being gone. The only thing I know we can do is pray and hope for the best.' 

Loved: She also leaves behind an 11-month-old daughter Dixie, pictured left after her birth, who was in the car but only suffered a scrape. She was engaged to be married to her children's father, Zack

Hughes, who was engaged to be married to the children's father, Zack Jennings, had recently left her job at Chik-Fil-A in Duncan to focus on bringing up her children.

Her family said she loved to wear camouflage clothing and have chosen a casket for her which will be lined with camouflage material. 

Jennings works as an assistant manager at the same Chik-fil-A and will be raising his children with the help of his mother and other relatives.

The Spartanburg County Coroner's Office and S.C. Highway Patrol are still investigating the crash, which occurred as she left the Mary Black Memorial Hospital on Skylyn Drive on Tuesday afternoon, to determine what happened.

Eric Hughes said he believes his daughter was distracted before driving into the back of the SUV, which had stopped at a traffic light. Its driver was not injured and the SUV was able to be driven from the scene.

After the crash, she was able to talk and complained of pain to her stomach, likely from the steering wheel, airbag or seat belt, which she had been wearing, The State reported. 

Friends are now raising money for her funeral costs and children on a gofundme page.
