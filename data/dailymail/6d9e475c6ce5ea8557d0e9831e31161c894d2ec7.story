Russia today hinted that Vladimir Putin would grant political asylum to whistleblower Edward Snowden who leaked the American government's monitoring of phone records and the web.

'We will take action based on what actually happens. If we receive such a request, it will be considered,' said the Russian president's official spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Former CIA undercover operative Snowden's whereabouts are unknown since he checked out of a hotel in Hong Kong on Monday.

Refuge: Russia today hinted that Vladimir Putin would grant political asylum to whistleblower Edward Snowden who leaked the American government's monitoring of phone records and the web

One Russian report stressed that the country has a consulate in Hong Kong where Snowden could make an asylum request.

The Russian angle contrasts with its total refusal to act on Western hints that it could help solve the Syrian crisis by granting asylum to its long-time ally President Bashar al-Assad and his family.

Snowden, 29, is a technology expert working for a private firm subcontracted to  the US National Security Agency.

Refusal: The Russian angle contrasts with its total refusal to act on Western hints that it could help solve the Syrian crisis by granting asylum to President Bashar al-Assad

Last week he told the Guardian 
newspaper of a mammoth surveillance operation run by the NSA on 
telephone and Internet records around the world. 

In the US he has been branded a 
traitor and there is pressure for his extradition from Hong Kong.  
However, he has triggered a debate in many countries on whether state 
snooping goes too far.  

Russian MP Robert Schlegel urged the Kremlin to look at a the possibility of granting political asylum to Snowden.

'It would be a good idea,' he said.

Putin is due to see US president Barack Obama at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland next week.

Snowden has said he wants to seek asylum in Iceland.

Iceland's interior minister, Hanna Birna Kristjánsdóttir, has the final say on whether the whistleblower would receive asylum in the country but a spokesman for her denied to The Guardian that the ministry had received any requests from Mr Snowden.

'At the moment we have received no inquiry or application from Mr Snowden, and we cannot therefore speculate on whether any such application would be granted,' Johannes Tomasson said.

The country of 320,000 people has served as the home base for the fundraising efforts of anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and earlier earned a reputation as a safe haven by taking in American fugitive former chess champion Bobby Fischer in 2005.

Mr Snowden's case already echoes that of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London last summer after Swedish authorities issued an international warrant for his arrest amid allegations of sexual assault. He has been hiding there ever since.

Iceland's government of newly-elected conservative Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, may not be so generous this time around. While still untested, it is widely seen as closer to Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the island country's cyber-haven image.

But Icelandic lawmaker Birgitta Jónsdóttir and International Modern Media Institute executive director Smari McCarthy released a statement on Sunday vowing to do all they could to help protect Mr Snowden, if he was able to make it to the shores of the tiny Nordic country.

'Whereas IMMI is based in Iceland, and has worked on protections of privacy, furtherance of government transparency, and the protection of whistleblowers, we feel it is our duty to offer to assist and advise Mr. Snowden to the greatest of our ability,' their statement reads, according to Forbes.com.

Checked out: Today an employee at the 5* Mira Hotel in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui, said a guest by the name of Edward Snowden had checked out of the hotel this morning

Caution: Snowden also revealed that he covered his head with a blanket when he communicates to muffle his voice

Holed up: Speaking from his hotel room, Snowden admitted he had only left his room three times since he arrived on May 20

The pair added that they were already
 working on detailing the legal protocols required to apply for asylum 
and said they were seeking a meeting with the newly appointed interior 
minister Mrs Kristjánsdóttir as soon as possible to discuss whether an 
application for asylum, if made, can be processed as a priority.

In the Guardian interview, Mr Snowden suggested Iceland was his number one option.

He said his 'predisposition is to 
seek asylum in a country with shared values, The nation that most 
encompasses this is Iceland. They stood up for people over internet 
freedom.'

McCarthy told The Guardian that they 
have been following the story 'with morbid fascination' and Mr Snowden's
 mention of Iceland was their 'cue to take action.'

'We are working on the basis that if he were to arrive in Iceland we would have a plan in place and ready to go,' he said.

Mr Snowden needs to make his way to 
Icelandic soil or show up at one of its embassies in order to claim 
asylum. But if he managed that, he would have the Icelandic people's 
support, McCarthy said.

The government would have to weigh up
 enraging its major trading partner in its decision to claim or reject 
asylum to Mr Snowden.

'However, it would be rather 
embarrassing for the States if it cut ties with this small nation 
because it had complied with its human rights duties,' McCarthy said.

He would be free to live in Iceland 
while immigration authorities decide his case, which could take more 
than a year, according to Helga Vala Helgadottir, a lawyer specializing 
in asylum cases.

Iceland has an extradition treaty 
with the United States, but it is unclear whether it would cover any 
crimes that Snowden might be charged with.

Meanwhile, Ecuador is another 
possible ally. The country's embassy in London is currently harboring 
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

Edward
 Snowden's whereabouts were not immediately known on Tuesday, although 
he was believed to be staying somewhere in the Chinese autonomous region
 that has a well-established, Western-style legal system inherited from 
its status as a former British colony.

Empty and on the market: Edward Snowden's former home in Waipahu, Hawaii, which he fled last month for Hong Kong so he could leak details about the U.S. government's secret surveillance programs

Secrets: A neighbour said today that the garage at the home had boxes stacked floor to ceiling when Snowden was planning his escape

Snowden checked out of Hong Kong's Mira Hotel on Monday and has not been seen in public in the territory.

No charges have been brought and no warrant has been issued for the arrest of Snowden.

He arrived in Hong Kong on May 20 and as a U.S. citizen is legally permitted to remain for 90 days.

He
 can also apply for asylum through the United Nations or attempt to fly 
to another country which, unlike Hong Kong, does not have an extradition
 agreement with the United States.

Even
 if an extradition request is brought by the U.S., Snowden could contest
 it on grounds of political persecution in a process that could drag on 
for years.

In addition, 
Hong Kong's high court in a ruling on a case concerning three African 
asylum-seekers ordered authorities to devise a unified standard for 
assessing asylum applications. The ruling effectively puts applications 
on hold until the new system is in place.

Jen
 Psaki, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, refused to say 
Monday whether the U.S. had made an extradition request or might do so 
in the future.

'Necessary': The top intelligence official, James R Clapper, said the NSA's intelligence measures, carried out at sites like this one in Maryland, were 'used to keep Americans safe'

Under the 
terms of its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong 
maintained its independent legal system, a boisterous media, and strong 
civil society that would likely object boisterously to any attempt to 
railroad Snowden through the legal system.

And though a semi-autonomous part of China, it ultimately answers to Beijing, which is often at odds with Washington.

Greenwald
 said he wasn't clear about exactly how Snowden made the decision to 
come to Hong Kong, but said simply evading the U.S. authorities wasn't 
the only factor he considered.

'It's very difficult for me to 
assess that choice because it was a very personal mix of factors that he
 took into account when deciding where he wanted to go, so if his only 
goal had been how can I best evade arrest, there probably would have 
been other better places for him to go,' said Greewald.

Greenwald said The Guardian plans to publish further stories based on information provided by Snowden.

Row: A security guard stands outside the US consulate in Hong Kong today, where inside officials will be trying to extradite Snowden back to the United States

The
 U.S. and Hong Kong routinely cooperate on requests to transfer 
criminals; in one high-profile case, Hong Kong extradited three al-Qaeda
 suspects to the U.S. in 2003.

The
 U.S. is also one of the largest investors in Hong Kong, a major 
business center for East Asia, and at least one local politician said 
she thought it best if Snowden simply left.

'Maybe he doesn't know we signed so many treaties.

The
 two parties have agreed to all of them. So he'd better leave Hong 
Kong,' said Regina Ip, a member of Hong Kong's legislative council and 
former secretary for security, was quoted as telling the Takung Pao 
newspaper.

While Beijing at times stands up to Washington, it may not want to for Snowden.

Beijing
 has often criticized foreign governments for harboring critics of its 
Communist government. China also is seeking U.S. cooperation on 
retrieving corrupt Chinese officials who have fled to America, often 
with sizeable assets.

Cyberhacking
 and cyberespionage have emerged as the newest friction in relations 
that presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping pledged over the weekend to 
improve.

Still, the extradition agreement gives Hong Kong ways to say no.

The U.S. and Hong Kong concluded
 the treaty with Beijing's blessing on the eve of the territory's hand 
back from Britain to China in 1997. Provisions allow one side to refuse a
 request if it's deemed to be politically motivated or if the suspect is
 unlikely to receive a fair trial.

Beijing
 may also have a veto. The agreement allows Beijing to refuse to 
extradite a Chinese national for reasons of national security.

A study by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1997 suggests
 Beijing may have wider discretion to prohibit any extradition, not just
 of Chinese nationals, on national security grounds.
