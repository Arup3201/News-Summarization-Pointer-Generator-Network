Vladimir Putin mistakenly thought that a journalist who has survived two strokes was attending a press conference drunk, it has emerged.

Vladimir Mamatov slurred his words slightly as he spoke to the Russian president during the televised event in Moscow today, prompting Putin to quip that he had been drinking. 

But it was later reported that Mr Mamatov is a stroke victim, and had suffered a head injury.

Speaking at the leader's annual press conference, the reporter asked Putin about why kvas - a mildly alcoholic fermented drink - could not compete with other soft drinks in local supermarkets.

In response, Putin joked, 'I see you've already partaken in your kvas,' according to journalist Alec Luhn, prompting the audience to erupt with laughter.

Mr Mamatov, who is from Kirov, a region known for its production of the drink, explained that he wanted to bring some of the drink in for Putin to taste, but that security would not allow it.

He said: 'I got it. You do not have a taster. My question is this. We make a lot of this kvas, we make it well and for long time.'

'Yes, I see this', Putin said, chuckling. He then went on to praise the journalist's question.

But Russian media was quick to correct the president, with Russia Today tweeting a correction to his comment about Mr Mamatov's drinking.

Posting on the news channel's official Twitter account, it said: 'Correction: Kirov journo who asked #Putin about #kvas NOT drunk - survived multiple strokes'.

Russian news sites LifeNews and Gazeta also reported, after an interview with a colleague, that the journalist in question was not drunk, but the survivor of two strokes and a head injury.

Also at the press conference, Putin admitted he is in love, fuelling rumours over a relationship with Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva.

Denying he had 'completely gone wild' in his romantic life, the divorced strongman revealed  that he 'loves' and is loved in return, but refused to disclose the identity of his mystery partner.

The subject of Putin's private life has been seen as taboo in Moscow but today he was asked by a journalist  if he had time for the opposite sex.
