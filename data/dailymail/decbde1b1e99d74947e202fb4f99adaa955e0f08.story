A large fire today took hold at a major coal-fired power station, sending plumes of thick black smoke billowing into the air.

A total of 15 fire crews were dealing with the blaze at Ferrybridge Power Station near Knottingley, West Yorkshire, after it started this afternoon.

Workers at the site were alerted at about 2pm and West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service workers arrived at the scene shortly afterwards.

Everyone working at the landmark power station beside the M62 and A1 has since been accounted for and no injuries have been reported.

A fire service spokesman said members of the public had called its control room due to the plumes of smoke which could be seen in the local area.

Emergency services were called after flames were spotted outside the coal-fired Ferrybridge Power Station near Knottingley, West Yorkshire

Ferrybridge C has two 650ft high chimneys and eight 400-ft high cooling towers, which are said to be the largest of their kind in Europe

Thick smoke and flames were witnessed coming from a large white building which stands close to the power 
station's cooling towers.

The
 National Grid said the power station was not currently generating 
electricity and so it did not expect power cuts as a result of the fire.

Traffic on the M62 slowed 
in both directions due to thick smoke blowing across the road and the A1
 was also affected between junctions 41 and 42.

Ferrybridge
 is operated by energy giant SSE and has had three power stations since 
1924. The current one, C, has operated since 1966.

It is a well-known landmark for drivers as it is situated close to where the M62 and the A1 meet, beside the River Aire.

An
 SSE spokesman said: ‘At around 2pm today a serious fire impacted Units 3
 and 4 of SSE's Ferrybridge C power station in West Yorkshire.   

A
 total of 15 fire crews are tackling the blaze, which has sent a plume 
of smoke into the air over the site's well-known cooling towers

The power station site is surrounded by miles of electricity cables and substations, meaning emergency services had to act quickly to stop the blaze spreading

Thick smoke could be seen coming from a  building which stands close to the power stations' cooling towers, which are visible from the M62 and M1

‘All persons on site have been accounted for and there are no reported injuries.  

‘The
 company's practised emergency response procedures were immediately 
activated and we are currently in the process of ensuring the site is 
made secure and safe.

‘The
 affected area in the site vicinity has been isolated by police and the 
West Yorkshire Ambulance Service hazardous area response team are also 
present.

‘West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service remains in attendance and is dealing with the incident with support from SSE engineers.

‘West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service has indicated the fire is now being brought under control.  

‘Due
 to planned maintenance neither of the affected units had been 
operational over the summer and therefore had not been supplying power 
to the National Grid at the time of today's incident.

The huge plume of black smoke which rose from the site this afternoon could be seen for miles around. It is still uncertain what started the fire

The huge size of the building, which is a well-known landmark for those travelling along the busy M62 and A1 roads, poses a challenge to emergency services

‘SSE
 will be undertaking an investigation to establish the full extent of 
damage in due course.  Early indications show the fire itself started in
 Unit 4 but also had some impact on Unit 3.  

‘Currently
 we do not expect Unit 4 to return to service in this financial year.  
Unit 3 is not expected to return to service before 1 November.

‘Our immediate priority is to manage the incident and to ensure the safety of staff, contractors and the general public.’

'The company's practised emergency response procedures have been activated.

‘West
 Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service are in attendance and dealing with 
the incident with assistance from expert engineers on site.

'All personnel have been accounted for and no injuries have been reported at this stage. 

Shocked locals watched from their gardens as huge flames shot up the side of the plant, which is operated by the energy giant SSE

Firefighters from all over Yorkshire have been drafted in as emergency services battle the blaze, which reportedly started at around 1.30pm today

‘It is too early to give any more information regarding this incident - however, we will issue a further statement when more details become available.'Our immediate priorities are to deal with the incident and to ensure the safety of staff, contractors and the general public.'

According
 to the SSE website, 'Ferrybridge C has two 198m (650ft) high chimneys 
and eight 115m (380ft) high cooling towers, which are the largest of 
their kind in Europe'.

The 
site has undergone major changes recently in the light of the EU's 
Industrial Emissions Directive, which aims to reduce pollution.

A 65MW multi-fuel plant was expected to start generating power next year.

The huge blaze comes just one day after eight fire crews were called to a massive blaze on Eastbourne pier in East Sussex.

Firefighters spent nearly 12 hours dousing the seafront attraction after a fire broke out in an amusement arcade.
