A landlord is trying to evict a tenant after discovering his Manhattan office space was being used for wild sex parties with transgender, transsexual and cross-dressing participants, a lawsuit claims.

The suit, filed by real estate mogul Laurence Gluck yesterday, claims tenant byteLair Inc. threw parties that got so out of control other tenants in the Midtown building saw people having sex in the lobby.

However, the company's owner described the accusations as 'ridiculous' and 'laughable'.

Gluck's lawsuit claims byteLair advertised the sixth floor office space on websites such as tlust.com (pictured), a social club 'held in a private discrete midtown loft with private and group play areas'

Gluck alleged the company advertised the sixth floor office space as a place for 'transsexual and/or transgender individuals and/or groups' to engage in sexual activity on websites such as tlust.com, according to the New York Daily News. 

Tlust.com, which calls itself a  social club for transsexuals, transvestites and crossdressers, advertises parties that are 'held in a discrete [sic] midtown loft with private and group play areas.'

It also promises coat check, lockers, complimentary soft drinks, snacks, condoms and lube, and invites guests to bring their own liquor. 

Software engineer and byteLair owner Vanessa Vance said she and many of her clients are transgendered and she plans to file a discrimination suit against Gluck (pictured) 

The suit, filed by Gluck's Hole in One Associates LP, claims the company transformed the office area by using sheets and room dividers to create smaller spaces.

Gluck said other tenants in the 12 E. 32 St. building initially complained of 'excessive noise' coming from the sixth floor before reporting people were wandering around the building searching for 'the party'. 

The landlord also claims that his representatives heard individuals 'engaging in sexual activity' when they visited the office to investigate further, according to the New York Post. 

His lawsuit, which claims that tenants 'are now fearful for their safety when entering and exiting the building', asks that the tenant be evicted.

But Vanessa Vance, who identified herself as byteLair's owner, is fighting the allegations. 

Vance, a software engineer, said she and many of her client and friends are transgendered. 

She said she also runs a transgendered support group out of her office and is 'shocked someone could be so misinformed'. 

Vance said she will file a discrimination suit against the company for hurting her business and has no plans to leave the building. 

'They're not going to push me out,' she said.
