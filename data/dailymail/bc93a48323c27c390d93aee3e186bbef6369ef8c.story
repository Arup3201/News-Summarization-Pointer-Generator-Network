Policing Britain's streets can be a hazardous occupation - but it seems officers can't even drop their guard when they get back to the office.

A series of bizarre office-based injury claims submitted by officers has shone a light on the extraordinary 'compensation culture' a the heart of many police forces across the UK.

In one staggering claim, a constable insisted he injured his back reaching to switch on a computer while another said he had hurt himself 'doing the washing'.

Among the hundreds of claims, 
revealed in a Freedom of Information request, was a Kent Police officer 
who injured his foot after being 'run over by an office chair'.

Another police woman broke her toe after 
knocking over a table during a tactical training exercise and another 
suffered ‘stinging eyes’ after accidentally squirting hand gel into 
their face.

The details emerged just a few days after it was revealed PC Kelly Jones, who
planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb 
while investigating a break-in, has dropped her claim for damages.

She
dropped her pursuit of damages in the hope that 'wider concerns the
public may have' can be resolved, according to the Police Federation.

Ms Jones faced controversy last year after she filed a civil claim against Steve Jones, the owner of the Nun's 
Bridges Filling Station, in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene.

A recent report revealed that police 
forces have paid out and estimated £9m in compensation to their own 
officers for injuries at work over the past three years.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'This is yet further evidence that the compensation culture has got completely out of hand in this country.

'Policing
is a difficult job that involves officers putting themselves at risk 
and some claims will have been perfectly legitimate and reasonable.

'However, a number of these claims will either have been nobody’s fault 
or could have been avoided with a bit of common sense: at the end of the
day, accidents do happen.

'Taxpayers
want to know that police forces are spending their money on frontline 
policing and keeping us safe, not settling spurious claims.

'When
police budgets are so tight and savings have to be found, people will 
be angry that so much of their cash is being spent on compensation and 
associated legal bills.'

Freedom of Information requests 
asking about injuries to officers and staff in police stations were 
answered by 22 forces around the UK.

In
some case, forces refused to specify which injury resulted in a 
compensation payout for fear of identifying an officer. It is also not 
clear which claims were dismissed during the adjudication process.

But
a Police Federation spokesman said: 'It is only right that officers 
should be offered the same protection as anyone else who might be 
injured while at work, often through no fault of their own, and forces 
will only pay compensation if a claim is valid.'

Despite
some forces omitting to state how the injuries were caused, bosses at 
Cambridgeshire, Kent, Cheshire, Cleveland and Norfolk Police revealed 
the full extent of injuries over the past 18 months.

A retired police officer, who asked 
not to be named, said: 'It’s not really the number of injuries that is 
the worry, it’s more than trivial nature of most of them.

'Some officers can’t seem to make a cup of coffee or navigate their way past a desk without hurting themselves.'

Another
officer, who has been in the job 10 years, laughed off the injuries, 
saying: 'You’ve got to laugh really - it’s like reading the script to a 
new Three Stooges film.

'How
can an officer break their toe knocking over a desk during tactical 
awareness training? It’s not exactly a ringing endorsement you can do 
your job is it?'

Most of the
police forces said that compensation claims were still on-going for a 
number of the incidents and that they would not reveal details of the 
exact claims as it could identify the officer or police staff member 
involved.
