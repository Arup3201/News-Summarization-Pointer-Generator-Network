Football star Wayne Rooney has splashed out on Botox treatment after signing a new £300,000-a-week contract, it has been claimed.

Plastic surgeons speculated that the Manchester United striker, 28, who has previously had cosmetic surgery to replace his thinning hair, underwent treatment which has prompted a striking change in his appearance.

Mr Rooney has appeared in recent television interview with a remarkably smooth forehead, while only a few months ago he had a much more wrinkled brow.

Leading surgeons have claimed that the dramatic change in Mr Rooney's appearance between the images in October and his appearance now is 'consistent' with using the controversial treatment.

However, a spokesman for Mr Rooney strongly denied the claims.

If the claims turn out to be true, Mr Rooney would join male celebrities including music mogul Simon Cowell and Celebrity Big Brother winner Rylan Clark in championing the skin-smoothing product.

Taimur Shoaib, of La 
Belle Forme clinic in Glasgow, told the Sunday People: 'He's got a nice 
youthful, smooth appearance.

With his newly-inflated salary, the cost of Botox, the trade name for Botulinum toxin, is unlikely to worry Mr Rooney.

With Harley Street clinics offering treatments for £200 a time, just one week's pay could buy 1,500 treatments.

The chemical decreases muscle activity in the area it is injected. It effectively paralyses the muscles, which reduces the appearance of wrinkles.

Injections tend to be effective for between three and six months.

Botox has some non-cosmetic uses, and is used to treat migraines and treat excessive sweating.

'His forehead looks very good. The changes 
we see would be consistent with someone having Botox.'

Meanwhile
 James McDiarmid, from the McDiarmid Hall Cosmetic Surgery Clinic in 
Cheltenham, Glocuestershire, said: 'In my opinion he has had Botox to 
his frontalis muscles.'

Mr Rooney's first cosmetic procedure - the hair transplant, was carried out in 2011. Days after having the operation he tweeted to confirm the £30,000 operation.

He said: 'Just to confirm to all my followers I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25, why not? I'm delighted with the result.'

The father-of-two had a follicular transfer in which hairs are moved from donor areas – usually at the back of the head – and then replanted in bald areas.

He had previously written about his hair loss in his autobiography. He admitted staring at himself in the mirror and thinking: 'Bloody hell, you're going bald and you're only a young lad.'

Mr Rooney's publicists today strongly refuted the Botox claims, telling the MailOnline they are 'total rubbish.'
