An elderly disabled woman has told how her loyal dogs kept her alive when she was badly injured by a fall in her kitchen.

Judy Muhe, a 76-year-old with Parkinson's disease, couldn't move and was left drifting in and out of consciousness when she fell over at home in Palmdale, California.

Muhe, who lives alone, had only her two golden retrievers - Higgins and Dodger - to come to her aid after the accident.

Savior: Judy Muhe, 76, told how her golden retreivers, Higgins (pictured) and Dodger, helped her when she had a dangerous fall in her kitchen

Loyal: The two pets stayed by her side for two days - forgoing food and water - in an attempt to keep her save while help arrived

Second savior: Muhe told how Dodger (pictured) nuzzled her and reminded her she was not alone through the ordeal

The two animals stayed with her through the agonizing two-day wait until somebody realized she was hurt, remaining at her side even without food or water.

Muhe described how the animals kept her spirits up - and the cold at bay - by nuzzling up against her propping her up, away from the tiled floor, ABC news reported.

Due to her Parkinson's disease - a degenerative disease of the nervous system that hampers movement - she is especially susceptible to cold. 

Concerned neighbors eventually found Muhe on the floor after checking in on her using a key she'd given them. They were able to get her medical help.  

Muhe, tearful at the thought of her dogs' unwavering loyalty, said: 'They went two days without food and water and stayed with me.

Demonstration: Higgins lay at Muhe's feet - staving off the cold, which is particularly dangerous to Parkinson's sufferers

Scene: Muhe had fallen onto her kitchen floor, injuring her head and shoulders. She later needed surgery

'By keeping me warm, keeping me comfortable as they could, they let me know that I was not alone.

'Dodger kept nuzzling me with his nose. He was laying beside me... My guardians - I have no doubt they would do it again.

Kathy Jacobs, the neighbor who found Muhe on the floor, told the station: 'The dogs were right here with her - they ran to the door then ran back to where she was - showing us she was there'.

Muhe bruised her head and hurt her shoulders in the fall - and needed two operations to fix the damage.

But she has now recovered, and lives at home with her two saviors once again.

Rescuer: Kathy Jacobs, a neighbor, was concerned after not hearing from Muhe, and found her semi-conscious on the floor when she went to check on her
