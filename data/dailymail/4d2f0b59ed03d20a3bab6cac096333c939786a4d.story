Farmed fish should be stunned before being killed because they deserve to be treated as humanely as cattle, the government's animal welfare body has said.

The Farm Animal Welfare Committee (FAWC) said people working with Britain's 100million harvested fish must 'recognise that their killing requires taking responsibility for the ending of individual lives'.

It argues that some species, including trout, have a 'sensory experience of pain' and that the public's perception that they don't need a high standard of welfare is based on ignorance, not science.

Give them a 'life worth living': A government animal welfare committee is recommending that Britain's 100million farmed fish be stunned like cattle before slaughter because they deserve to be treated humanely

The group says the image of fish suffocating after being caught in the wild has become the 'norm' in people's minds.

The report states: 'Society should provide farmed animals with "a life worth living" and an increasing number with "a good life".

'We affirm that these principles should extend to farmed fish.

'Both "a life worth living" and "a good life" encompass a whole life up to and including death.'

In a report to the government seen by The Times, the FAWC makes 16 recommendations, including stunning fish before slaughter because asphyxiation is not 'immediate' and has been shown to be 'stressful'.

The British Trout Association told the paper that it supported the changes as long as regulatory controls took into account differences in the husbandry between aquatic and terrestrial animals.

The Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation said it believed it was already 'well ahead' of what any new legislation would require.

Britain has around 750 fish farms which mostly breed salmon and rainbow trout.

Scotland harvested some 35million salmon in 2012.
