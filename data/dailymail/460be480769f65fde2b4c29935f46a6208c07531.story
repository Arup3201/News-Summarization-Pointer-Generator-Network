Can you tell me how many stars are in the sky tonight? Can you call Windsor Castle and find out if the Queen is in? Can you store my lobster in your freezer?

These are just some of the peculiar requests Travelodge staff have been asked by customers over the last year.

The UK hotel chain has revealed the most bizarre requests that some of its 17 million customers have asked whilst staying in one of the Company's 513 hotels in the last 12 months.

A guest at Edinburgh Central Travelodge asked a staff member if he could borrow his suit for a job interview

Between them, Travelodge hotel teams receive more than 200,000 strange requests every year.

This year, they ranged from the innocuous but fairly odd: 'I have lost my friend, can you send someone to go and find him?' to the helpful: 'Do you have any rooms that I can clean, as I love cleaning?'

One guest struggled with the basics while staying in a Travelodge hotel, asking: 'Can you give me instructions on how to use the taps in the bathroom?' 

While another seemed confused about simple dietary matters, asking: 'Do the chips contain potato? I am watching my carbs.'

One guest asked if they could store a lobster in the freezer, while another asked if chips contained potato

There was a rise in requests from business customers seeking help to prepare for their important meetings and presentations.

But even the astutest of businessmen asked some puzzling questions during their stay. 

One such customer who was staying at Docklands Travelodge asked the hotel team if he could practice his board presentation in Mandarin to the hotel team prior to a meeting.

Another, staying at Edinburgh Central Travelodge, asked the hotel manager if he could borrow his suit for the morning as he had a job interview and he forgot his suit at home. 

Meanwhile, the hotel receptionist at Luton Travelodge received a call from a PA to see if her boss could be dropped off by helicopter in the hotel car-park.
