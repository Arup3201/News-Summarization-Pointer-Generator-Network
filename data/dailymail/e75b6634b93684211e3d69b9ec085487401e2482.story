Brendon de Jonge held the halfway lead at the Valspar Championship as gusting winds made scoring difficult on day two in Florida.

The Zimbabwean recorded four birdies and two bogeys in a steady 69 to finish six under and open up a one-shot lead over a group of five players including Jordan Spieth, who fired the joint lowest round of the day with a 67.

Kevin Streelman, Derek Ernst, Ryan Moore and Henrik Stenson were also on five under, Ernst having got to eight under at one point with a run of five birdies before dropping three shots in his final five holes.

Brendon de Jonge posted a solid round of 69 to take the lead on the second day at the Valspar Championship

De Jonge began on the 10th and dropped a shot on the par-five 14th where he had holed from 126-yards for eagle on Thursday, before a birdie on 18 saw him turn level.

Another birdie followed on the first before a bogey on the sixth and two further birdies on the seventh and ninth, with De Jonge admitting the wind was making life difficult.

'It's tricky out there,' he told www.pgatour.com. 'It's one of those golf courses where it's tough enough to get it on the fairway when it's still and when the wind blows it's added difficulty.

'It's difficult to pick it out there. It gets in these tress and swirls around so you've got to try and stay patient as best you can.'

Spieth registered seven birdies and three bogeys on his way round, while Stenson opened with an eagle but could not maintain his momentum as he signed for a 70.

Jordan Spieth shot the lowest round of the day, a 67, in difficult conditions, to sit in joint second place

Ian Poulter was then in the group at four under alongside Ricky Barnes, Lucas Glover and Sean O'Hair.

Poulter started on the back nine and got himself to six under at the turn with birdies on 12,14 and 18 before back-to-back bogeys at five and six saw him slip back into the pack.

But the Englishman is feeling confident for the weekend and believes the layout at Copperhead suits his game.

'Solid play,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'This golf course is a good golf course for me - it's short, it's tricky. It's not about hitting driver off every tee - it's about positional play.'

He added: 'It's about putting it in to play to set up your second shot. The greens are small but undulating.

'The wind has now picked up and that's playing tricky and I've done a good job putting it in play and giving myself plenty of chances.'

Ian Poulter was reasonably pleased with his performance which saw him two off the lead after two rounds

Another Englishman who is feeling better about his game is Luke Donald after shooting a 68 on Friday which left him two under.

The former world number one has seen his form desert him in the past couple of years and his last PGA Tour win came here in 2012 but, after finishing in a tie for seventh at the Honda Classic, he feels he is getting closer to his best.

'It's been a while,' he said. 'I had a chance at Honda a couple of weeks ago. I need to keep giving myself chances and keep putting myself back into contention again.

'I think once I keep doing that and getting the juices flowing and feeling it again then hopefully the results will come.'

Adam Scott splashes out of a bunker on a day which saw him lose his tour-long streak of 45 cuts made

Jonathan Byrd recorded a two-bounce ace on the 15th but could not make the cut while Justin Rose, Jamie Donaldson and Padraig Harrington were also among those returning home for the weekend.

Adam Scott also missed out - ending the longest active cut streak on PGA Tour. The Australian had gone 45 consecutive PGA Tour events - and 57 tournaments worldwide - without missing a cut.
