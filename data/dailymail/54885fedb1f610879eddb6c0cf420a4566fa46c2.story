Not since the International Olympic Committee banned British cake decorators from making rings out of marzipan, have sporting officials been such party-poopers.

For FIFA have ordered Formula One world championship leader Nico Rosberg to remove an image of the World Cup trophy from his helmet.

Rosberg tweeted earlier in the week that he was planning to wear the design at this weekend's grand prix at Hockenheim in homage to the victory of the German football team. A piece of harmless fun? No, the serious business of, err, business did not permit such fripperies.

'FIFA is obliged to take action against any unauthorised reproduction of its intellectual property in a commercial context,' said a FIFA spokesman, augustly.

'If FIFA allowed infringements of its intellectual property, it would risk losing its legal right and title to such works.

'An example of the strength of FIFA's intellectual property assets is reflected by recent research in seven key global markets where the FIFA World Cup trophy recorded an average recognition level of 83 per cent.

'These levels are significantly higher than any other sporting trophies. As a result, we cannot allow a commercially branded helmet to feature the FIFA World Cup trophy as this would jeopardise the rights of our commercial affiliates.'

This rebuke prompted Rosberg into a swift redesign that replaced the trophy on top of the helmet with a large gold star.

Rosberg, who grew up in Monaco and recently had his bone fides as a German jocularly questioned by Hamilton, watched Germany's World Cup final win against Argentina at his parents' house.

Of the helmet controversy, he said: 'The decision was a surprise, but I understand. The big star cannot be taken away. It is ours.'

FIFA may be killjoys, but their response is not dissimilar from the one that could be expected of comparable sporting bodies. Indeed, Formula One would have acted just as swiftly had its commercial rights been compromised.

Tribute: Schumacher's wife Corinna took out a page of the German Grand Prix programme to thank fans

Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher's wife Corinna has thanked fans for sending 'positive energy' following the skiing accident that left the seven-time world champion in a coma for six months.

Writing a personal note in the German Grand Prix programme, she said he faced a phase of rehabilitation that 'will presumably take a long time'.
