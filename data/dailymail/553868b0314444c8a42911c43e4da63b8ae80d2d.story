A female pastor arrested during a peaceful protest in Ferguson last night has told of her shock as she was 'grabbed' and dragged along the ground so roughly that it tore off her vest marking her out as clergy.

Speaking to MailOnline just hours after her release Pastor Rebecca Ragland recalled her ordeal and voiced her belief that anyone of conscience should stand with the protesters.

She said: 'I was completely stunned. All I can tell you is what my body experienced. My mind at that point was just in shock.

'I was grabbed so hard that I fell to the ground. Then I was just being yanked and it was pretty rough. I'm hurting today.'

Pastor Ragland's arrest marked the first police action to be taken against protesters following Governor Nixon's declaration of a state of emergency.

Moment of arrest: This is the moment Reverend Rebecca Ragland was arrested by police. She told MailOnline it was after she was grabbed and dragged along the ground

Concerned: Reverend Ragland said she was demonstrating in Ferguson because she believed people of color are not fairly treated and that it was her duty as a Christian to stand with them

Vest: How Reverend Ragland was dressed for the demonstration. She went towards the front, she said, to de-escalate the situation but was arrested 

The minister for Ferguson's Episcopal Church of the Holy Communion was one five protesters arrested for blocking a street outside the police headquarters.

The handful of protesters were faced down by a line of officers in full riot gear as impatience grows in the city waiting for a Grand Jury decision on whether to indict Darren Wilson for shooting unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18.

According to Reverend Ragland the group - only numbering around 15 - blocking the road were dispersing when the St Louis County officers moved in.

She said, 'I think everybody was completely shocked. We were dispersing at that point. Then they came down so I turned around and I thought, 'Well I'm a de-escalator so I need to stay at the front.'

Rev Ragland is one of many local clergy who have taken to the streets in an attempt to defuse the volatile relationship between protesters and police that saw the Missouri town erupt in violence following the shooting on August 9.

She was wearing a bright orange vest with the word 'Clergy' clearly printed across her back. Today she believes that far from protecting her this made her a target for officers keen to make a point ahead of the violence anticipated when the Grand Jury makes its announcement.

Last night's arrest has been read as a clear message that law enforcement will come down hard on any and all protesters.

She explained, 'I think it's noteworthy that they picked three people from the line. One was behind me wearing an Anonymous mask. One was at the very end and he was wearing an anonymous mask. And me.'

Dragged from the front of the protest, the forty-six year old mother of two was cuffed and put in a police van along with the other arrestees.

She said, 'As soon as they cuffed me they took me right back to the paddy wagon. Two men were holding my arms. They put me in a van. At this point the arresting officer spoke to me.'

Rev Ragland would not recount the detail of that brief exchange other than to say that the officer 'expressed how he felt.' She does not, she said, want to 'vilify the police.'

She and the other protesters were driven to a converted garage behind the police station where they were patted down and basic information taken. They were then put back in the van and transported to Clayton's Buzz Westfall Justice Center. At no point did anybody read her her rights.

Once there, she recalled, 'You go from nylon handcuffs to metal cuffs when you're brought in.

'They take you inside another garage and you stand against a wall. You see a nurse then after that they take all of your possessions that are valuable or loose - jewelry and all that mess, shoe laces.

Divide: Although most demonstrations have been pro-Michael Brown some, such as this woman's protest, have been in support of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown to death

Tensions: Demonstrations are already taking place in Ferguson, Missouri, with calls for Darren Wilson to be indicted by the grand jury, which meets again on Friday, over the killing of Michael Brown

'At that point you're processed in terms of initial intake. Then you go through a numbered door and when you get to the other side it's like what I would call the bus station. It's where you do your time if you're taken in on a misdemeanor or whatever.'

The pastor was fingerprinted - a process that she admitted left her feeling 'uneasy' - and has been charged with 'refusal to disperse and failure to move vehicle which is obstructing flow of traffic'.

She was lucky, she said. She was released at 3am barely four hours after the arrest that so stunned her.

It is not the first time that Rev Ragland has had dealings with police in Ferguson. On October 13 she was detained for nine hours before being released without charge.

That encounter came during a highly controversial period during which Ferguson police adopted the 'five second rule' meaning that any protester who stopped walking for more than that time could be arrested.

The practice was deemed illegal by a federal judge and County Chief of Police, John Belmar, stripped Ferguson police of their authority over protests.

Yet despite her experiences Rev Ragland was anxious not to attribute blame.

She said, 'The clergy want to be compassionate voices to soothe people who are so broken and hurt and to be a voice for the kind of justice that's actually going to move the polarities to a point where they can heal instead of this place where we're just shouting and hurting.'

She intends to go back out along protesters following the Grand Jury's announcement because, she said, 'My role is to advocate for justice and to advocate for peace and for change in a system that has for too long needed to change.

'There is plenty of evidence to suggest that people of color are treated in a discriminatory fashion by our justice system.

'I think that that is sufficient reason for those of us of conscience to stand with the protesters. It's what Jesus would do.'

Residents of Ferguson, Missouri, prepared Wednesday for a grand jury report expected soon on the fatal August shooting of an unarmed black teen by a white policeman, an event that laid bare long-simmering racial tensions in the St. Louis suburb.

The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked weeks of sometimes violent protests. Many businesses have boarded up their windows as they expect another wave of demonstrations to follow the grand jury's decision, particularly if officer Darren Wilson is not charged. 

More than two-thirds of the residents of Ferguson are black, but its mayor, police chief and most of its police department are white. Black residents say their conflicts with the police long predate Brown's shooting.

In a sign of tensions ahead of the grand jury report, a few dozen protesters gathered outside the city police station late on Wednesday in sub-freezing temperatures faced by officers in riot gear.

Some protesters chanted 'Indict that cop.' Police arrested about six people when protesters tried to block the street after ignoring orders to keep it clear. The arrests were the first of protesters in about a week.

On Tuesday, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon named a panel of 16 commissioners to develop solutions to the deep-seated socioeconomic disparities in and around Ferguson.

Despite the tensions, some in Ferguson have tried to carry on life as usual. A crew of city workers spent Wednesday morning putting up Christmas decorations on the street that is home to the Ferguson Police Department. Activists say that will be the first place demonstrators assemble after the grand jury report.

Officials have said the grand jury is expected to make its decision by the end of the month.

The Ferguson-Florissant School District told parents on Wednesday that schools may close early or not open at all on the day the grand jury's decision comes, with the decision based on when officials learn the report is coming.

Country singer Hunter Hayes, citing the state of emergency declared by the governor, canceled a concert scheduled for Thursday night at an arena on the campus of St. Louis University. 

Nixon has defended his decision to declare the state of emergency ahead of the grand jury's decision, a move some called heavy-handed, particularly given that protests in recent days had been peaceful. The state of emergency allows the National Guard to deploy to the St. Louis area. 

St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay asked for 400 National Guard troops to be deployed to his city, to work in alternating 12-hour shifts at 45 locations around the city.

There are conflicting accounts of what preceded the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown, with some witnesses contending he had raised his hands in surrender and others describing a struggle between the teen and Wilson.
