Safety levels at three Australian airports run by military air traffic controllers has come under fire after a former Qantas chief pilot called on the government to investigate why their safety records were poorer than those of civilian counterparts.

Chris Manning, who was Qantas' chief pilot from 2002-08, has called for a three person independent inquiry to examine why Darwin, Townsville and Newcastle airports are at higher risk of experiencing mid-air collisions, the  Australian reports. 

The three airports, while not unsafe, have a higher number of 'loss of separation' incidents, which means passenger planes pass too close to each other, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau report.

'There should be no difference in the level of safety at all towered aerodromes that civil aircraft use,' Mr Manning told the newspaper.

The report, released in October last year, found that military controllers were involved in 36 percent of loss of separation occurrences between 2008-12, even though they were responsible for controlling only 25 percent of aircraft movements.

'Most of these loss of separation occurrences were contributed to by air traffic controller actions,' the ATSB report found.

'This may be a result of the nature of aircraft operations and airspace constraints at some military airports, leading to reduced use and effectiveness of strategic separation defences, thereby placing more responsibility for separating aircraft directly onto the controllers.'

Newcastle Airport is one of three run by military air traffic controllers because they are adjacent to military bases

Darwin, Townsville and Newcastle airports are all next to military bases, which means military air traffic controllers are responsible for controlling civil air traffic too.

'I find it difficult to believe that a ATSB report that highlights safety issues has received scant attention - makes you wonder why they bother doing a report if there's no obvious desire to address the real problems raised,' Mr Manning said.

He has also called on the government to subject Australia's military air traffic controllers to the same safety auditing the Civil Aviation Safety Authority conducts on its civilian counterparts.
