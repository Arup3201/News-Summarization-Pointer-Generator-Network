Families who bend together, stay together - and become internet sensations.

Yoga devotee Laura Kasperzak, 36, has taken Instagram by storm, with more than 700,000 followers worshiping the artful photographs she posts of herself and her two children in elaborate poses.

Some of the New Jersey mother's most popular selfies feature her adorable four-year-old daughter, Mini, who mimics her mom’s impeccable backbends and taste in leggings.

'(Mini) is the ham of my two children, and loves to be photographed,' Kasperzak told the Baby Center blog.

'Just recently she was doing a headstand and said ‘Mommy, take a picture!’ After I did she said ‘Let me see.’ She goes, ‘Oh no, mommy, we have to do it again. I wasn’t smiling'.'

Kasperzak, who has a background in cheer leading and gymnastics, has been practicing yoga for 17 years.

She said she involves her husband and children in her yoga practice to enhance her experience and bond with them.

'It’s an amazing way to create memories and spend time with one another,' the flexible mom said, according to YogaBeyond.

The devoted yogi fired up the Instagram account in March 2012 at the suggestion of her niece, shooting her own photos using an interval timer on her Nikon.

She figured she’d collect a few 'likes', but within a year, her lovely photos were getting major attention.

'It’s
 been a lifelong dream for the both of us to create a business with a 
good friend. We wanted to use it as a platform to spread health and 
wellness to everyone, especially moms,' Kasperzak told Today.com.

Actor Alec Baldwin's flexible wife Hilaria Baldwin, 30, has also jumped on the yoga-selfie bandwagon, photographing herself and baby daughter Carmen in yoga poses.

The self-described 'namastater' has taken some interesting photos for her 365-day yoga posture challenge, including one of herself and Carmen holding up their legs on a moving train.

However Baldwin has far fewer Instagram followers than Kazperzak's astonishing 700,000.
