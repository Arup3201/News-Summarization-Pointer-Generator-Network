Toronto's City Council today voted overwhelmingly to strip crack-smoking Mayor Rob Ford of some of his powers in the latest attempt to box in the brash leader who has refused to resign.

The motion, approved in a 39-3 vote, suspends Ford's authority to appoint and dismiss the deputy mayor and his executive committee, so Ford is unable to fire members who speak out against him.

An unusually subdued Ford vowed to fight the motion in court.

'I can't support this and obviously I have no other options but to challenge this in court,' the mayor said.

A few members had expressed concerns about the move to reduce his powers, even though they said they disapproved of the mayor's conduct.

'We are collectively disgusted with the mayor's behavior,' Councilor Anthony Perruzza said. 'If one day we are disgusted with someone’s political views or their political positions, basically we can do the same thing?'

The vote came a day after yet another series of antics from Ford that outraged city councilors, anti-drunk driving advocates and even Toronto's football team.

Most city councilors are frustrated by Ford's refusal to step aside since he admitted last week to smoking crack, but they lack the authority to force him out of office unless he is convicted of a crime.

In the span of a few hours on Thursday, Ford used obscene language to deny that he pressured a female employee for oral sex, admitted that he had driven while drinking and then apologized for his vulgarity and said he was seeking professional help, though he refused to give details.

Allegations that he made sexual advances towards staffer Olivia Gondek had sparked an angry outburst earlier in the day.

'It says that I wanted to eat her 
p****,' he told reporters. 'I would never do that. I'm happily married. 
I've got more than enough to eat at home, thank you very much.'

At
noon, the mayor held yet another press conference backed by his wife 
Renata to apologize for his 'graphic language' blaming the 'impulse in 
my remarks' on the last six months of 'tremendous stress'.

'The
revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts and prostitution have pushed 
me over the line,' he said. 'I used unforgivable language.'

He also upset the Toronto Argonauts by wearing the football team's jersey at City Hall on Thursday when he made vulgar statements and admitted to driving while drunk.

Councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a former ally, said: 'We need to take away his power for the good of the city. 

'The tide has turned and there are very few people that are prepared to defend him given his vulgar comments and his admission that not only does he takes drugs but that he seems to be comfortable drinking and getting behind the wheel.'

Ford's troubles began escalating in May when news reports first surface of a video showing him smoking crack.

After
month of evading the question, the mayor admitted to having smoked 
crack when Toronto police announced they had obtained the video during 
the course of a massive drug investigation that has ensnared a close 
friend of Ford.

Revelations
have rapidly surfaced of other startling behavior, from former aides 
alleging that the mayor has been frequently drunk on the job, to a video
showing the mayor threatening to kill someone in an incoherent rant.

It
has been a stunning decline for the 44-year-old mayor who was elected 
three years ago with fervent support from Toronto's conservative-leaning
outer suburbs, where many voters felt angry about they considered 
wasteful spending and elitist politics at City Hall.

Throughout the ordeal, his wife Renata has stood by him and pursed her lips as she appeared at his side during his press conference on Thursday.

The couple met in high school when they were only living a few blocks from each other, and got married in 2000. They have an 8-year old daughter, Stephanie, and a 5-year-old son, Douglas.

But she is famously secretive, even to people within the Ford circle, and has been described as the 'invisible wife' and an 'enigma' by Toronto Life Magazine.

The Ford marriage has been far from 
perfect. In 2008, a domestic dispute started between the two when Ford 
called the police because of his wife's 'irrational, out-of-control' 
behavior.

When police 'saw the situation' they informed him to leave with the children so he took them to his mother's house.

The next day, Ford returned to his house to take a shower and change clothes and that's when Renata called police.

Ford was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her.

The charges were eventually dropped due to 'credibility issues' on Renata's part and the couple seemed to patch things up after the incident.

'Everything's going great...whatever it takes,' Ford said when he finally returned to his home. 'I support my wife. My wife supports me.'
