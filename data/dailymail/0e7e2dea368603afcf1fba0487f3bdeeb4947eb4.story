Only a third of elderly people have ever used the internet, according to government statistics.

Whether for shopping, banking or catching up with news, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that 7.1 million adults in the UK have never been online.

Around 14 per cent of the adult population of the UK have not surfed the web, but the number has fallen by 10 per cent a year ago.

A graphic from the ONS shows a comparison of age groups of people who have never used the internet. Just over 3 in every 10 adults aged 75+ have surfed the web

Of all the people who have missed out, approximately 45 per cent are over the age of 75, while perhaps unsurprisingly almost all 16 to 24-year-olds have connected to the internet.

Men are more likely to be technologically enabled than women, with 88 per cent of men and 84 per cent of women ever going online.

The ONS quarterly report on internet access states: 'Internet use is linked to various socio-economic and demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, disability, geographical location and weekly earnings.

'For example, those who are less likely to have used the internet include both the elderly and disabled adults.'

Around 14 per cent of the adult population of the UK have not surfed the web, but the number has fallen possibly because more people are accessing the internet on a variety of devices including smartphones

Individuals with a disability are approximately four times more likely to have never used the internet than people without a disability.

The study found around 3.6 million disabled adults have never used the internet, which represents about a third of disabled people in the UK and 54 per cent of UK adults who have not surfed the web.

However, the figures show that since 2011, the 
number of internet users has increased by 2.9 million and now stands at 
43.6 million adults.

By 
region, London and the South East have the highest proportion of 
Internet users at 89 per cent, while Northern Ireland has the lowest at 
79 per cent.

The statistics came out in the same 
week that Facebook has said the UK is leading the way in Europe by 
accessing the social network on mobile phones.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that 7.1 million adults in the UK have never been online
and a third of elderly people - sometimes known as silver surfers - have not used the internet

Facebook has revealed for the first time that more than 24 million Britons log on to the website every day and 80 per cent do so using their smartphone or tablet.

A report by media regulator Ofcom in March, said UK adults spend more than 15 hours online each week â€“ up by five hours from six years ago.

A combination of older generations going online, the continuing rise of social networking sites and the number of people who own smartphones are being credited for the rise.

the study suggests growth is being driven by older age groups such as those aged between 45 and 54-years-old, but that the most elderly members of society were being left behind in the online revolution.

According to the report, nearly nine in ten of over-75s do not use the internet on any device.
