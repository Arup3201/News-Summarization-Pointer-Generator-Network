Four in ten Americans have been revealed to get less than the recommended amount of nightly sleep, according to a new Gallup poll.

Doctors suggest adults get between seven and nine hours sleep per night, and the national average is 6.8 hours.

The poll was conducted this year and the last study came out in 2004, and while there have been some marked changes, the net results have stayed the same.

Breaking it down by hours: The number of people getting eight hours of sleep has increased but the rates of those getting seven and nine have decreased

The majority- 59 per cent- of respondents get seven hours of sleep or more per night, and 40 per cent got six or less both this year and nearly a decade ago in 2004.

The rates have also held for those getting five hours or less (14 per cent) and six hours (26 per cent).

Changes came in the longer sleepers, as fewer reported getting seven hours as the rate dropped from 28 per cent to 25 per cent, while the number getting nine hours or more increased from 25 per cent to 29 per cent.

While there do not appear to be massive differences over the course of the past ten years, the changes appear far more sizable when compared to the first iteration of the survey which was taken in 1942.

In their minds: Even though they are not getting as much as recommended, the majority of people believe that it is enough for them

Back then, the average nightly sleep clocked in at 7.9 hours, meaning that the nation's work force got more than an hour extra compared to this year's findings.

Today's masochists and workaholics appear to come out feeling stronger than the experts but just barely as more people feel like they get as much sleep as they need while slightly fewer wish that they got some more shut eye.

Those disregarding the experts were in the majority, as 56 per cent thought they got enough sleep and only 43 per cent complained about wanting more.

Economic implications: With 40 per cent of Americans getting less than the recommended number of hours of sleep every night, that means that fewer are fully rested at work

The study also breaks up the respondents by age which helps shed some light on the reported answers.

The biggest age group that gets more than seven hours of sleep per night are those 65 and up, 67 per cent of whom fell in that category and the remaining 33 per cent were six or less.

From there, the disparity between six and seven hours decreases incrementally according to age, with 62 per cent of 50-64 year olds getting seven hours, 56 per cent of 30-49 year olds, and 54 per cent of 18-29 year olds.
