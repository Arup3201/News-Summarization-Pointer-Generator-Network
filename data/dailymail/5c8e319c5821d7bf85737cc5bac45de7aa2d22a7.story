Vernon Kay looks ahead to Sunday night’s NFC East showdown between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles.

The Eagles are top of the NFC East with four wins from their opening five games this season, but the Giants draw level with their rivals with victory at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday.

When I saw that Channel 4 was covering this game, it brought back real fond memories of what the NFL to me is all about. This is one of the hardest and toughest rivalries that the league has to offer. The Giants and Eagles are pretty much neighbours in terms of states. It is a bitter rivalry that is on par with Liverpool against Manchester United.

Over the years the Giants always seemed to come out on top when the likes of Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor were playing and Bill Parcells was their head coach. The Eagles had Randall Cunningham who, little did we know then, subliminally reinvented the quarterback position if you look at the quarterbacks we have now that can run and throw like Cam Newton and Robert Griffin III.

At the moment, it is all much of a muchness in the NFC East. The rivalries within the NFC East are epic and this is always an exciting division. It’s a shame the Redskins can’t get up and running, but this division could be won by any one of the Eagles, Cowboys and Giants. I think it’s going to be even-steven all the way and whoever comes third might even have a shot at a Wild Card spot.

Eli Manning has been on fire in the last few games for the Giants. He started the season a bit shaky and everyone was talking about him being prone to interceptions. But in the last two games he has scored more than 30 points in each game. His favourite target is his tight end Larry Donnell, which is interesting because the Giants very rarely use their tight ends. But, having said that, Victor Cruz is on form now as well and Odell Beckham Jr is coming into the frame too.

Eli has got his haters. He is a bit like Tony Romo in the sense that you either like him or you loathe him. But he’s a proven Super Bowl winner. He has won more Super Bowls than his brother even though Peyton is smashing records. There is only one statistic that really matters in the NFL - how many Super Bowl rings you are wearing.

Unfortunately for the Giants, their running back Rashad Jennings is injured for this game. But they have another running back in Andre Williams stepping up. He is a big, powerful running back who can take the hits.

On the flip side, the Eagles defense is not the best. They’ve allowed more than 400 yards per game, which is pretty shocking. Their secondary is pretty flaky as well and if Cruz, Donnell and Beckham Jr can get going for the Giants then it is going to be a high-scoring game.

With the Eagles offense, everyone talked about Chip Kelly coming into the league with his spread formation and quick tempo. That seems to have slowed down now. Michael Vick has left and Nick Foles is at the helm, but he needs a good game against the Giants. He has an opportunity to really open up this New York secondary, but the problem is that his offensive line is pretty banged up. For this offense to work, he needs time to release the ball. Last year he only had two interceptions but he has had five already this season. I think that comes down to the fact that his offensive line is pretty banged up.

Running back Darren Sproles moved to Philadelphia from the New Orleans Saints

At running back, Darren Sproles is so small and fast and he makes it tough for the big defensive guys up front. LeSean McCoy doesn’t need any introduction because he has proven that he is one of the best running backs in the NFL.

It depends on whether the offensive line for the Eagles is up to holding back the Giants defensive line. That is what this game will come down to because they have both got a shaky secondary.
