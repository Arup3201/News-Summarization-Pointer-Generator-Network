Police have arrested the parents of a nine-month-old girl after her father accidentally shot inside her New York City home with an illegally-owned gun.

Pedro Rosales, 47, told officers he was cleaning his gun in his Brooklyn apartment when it  discharged on Sunday. 

The bullet hit the child in the hip. She was taken to Woodhull Medical Center and then transferred to Bellevue Hospital for surgery. Her injuries were not considered to be life-threatening. 

Scene: NYPD officers stand outside the apartment in Brooklyn where a nine-month-old girl was shot in the hip while her father cleaned his  gun. Pedro Rosales, 47, and mother Jessica Aguilar, 24, have been arrested

Rosales was arrested on charges of assault, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and endangering the welfare of a child.

Authorities revealed that he has also already been charged with weapons-related offences.  

The mother, Jessica Aguilar, 24, was arrested on reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child charges.

The New York Post reported that the pair were riding the subway to Myrtle Avenue. When they got off the baby started to cry.

They hailed a livery cab, they flagged down police officers and told them that the baby was sick.

Residence: Officers detained the pair when they returned to the apartment complex and found the door partially open and the gun lying on the floor 

Rosales and Aguilar were later charged after police found the door to their apartment was left open and the gun was on the floor. 

Standing outside the 75th precinct where the pair were being held, Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams insisted that laws need to be changed and higher penalties put in place for those carrying illegal firearms.

'We can’t continue to have a culture where illegal guns are in homes or premises with children,' Adams told CBS New York. 'Children should be around toys, not weapons.'

Plea: Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams insisted that laws need to be changed and higher penalties put in place for those carrying illegal firearms around children
