French fishermen are among a dozen people accused of smuggling more than 200 illegal immigrants across the Channel to the south coast of England.

They are said to have dropped them off at small ports and remote beaches and coves between Plymouth and Weymouth to avoid immigration checks.

Armed officers arrested members of the human trafficking gang in dawn raids in Brittany on Tuesday.

UK border staff interrogate Romanians in Marble Arch: Arrests are expected in Britain after police in France broke up an alleged people smuggling ring that brought Albanian migrants into the country for £12,000 a family

The fishermen and sailing boat 
skippers are alleged to have ferried more than 200 Albanian immigrants 
across the sea in their own vessels over an 18-month period. There were 
14 trips, mostly in 2012, and the immigrants paid up to £8,000 each, 
according to French police.

The
 criminal mastermind behind the trafficking ring, a wealthy Kosovan, was
 arrested in the port city of St Malo. Another Kosovan, who is thought 
to have helped to organise the smuggling trips, was arrested at his home
 in Lamballe, near St Brieuc.

Ten
 local fishermen and sailing boat captains were also rounded up in 
fishing ports and towns in Brittany's Cotes-d'Armor region as part of 
the international police operation.

Last night all the suspects were in custody in Rennes. More arrests are expected in the UK and France in the coming days.

A
 French police spokesman said: 'This gang are believed to have smuggled 
around 200 Albanians from Brittany to the southern coast of England.

'It is thought they were dropped off at smaller ports and beaches along the English coast between Weymouth and Plymouth.

'We
 are in contact with our counterparts in Britain and inquiries into 
other gangs possibly involved in people trafficking between Britain and 
France are ongoing.'

A 
police source added: 'The method was chosen because it avoids the many 
checks that lorries go through when they board ferries to the UK.'

The
 traffickers carried the immigrants from ports in Normandy and Brittany,
 often travelling in hired pleasure boats. Prosecutor Brigitte 
Ernoult-Cabot, who coordinated the French operation said: 'There were 14
 trips over a period of 18 months.'

Albania
 is not a member of the EU although it wants to join, so its people, who
 are among the poorest in Europe, require a visa to visit the UK or work
 here.  If discovered by British officials, Albanians without residency 
rights face deportation, but many find work in the black economy.

The
 joint Franco-British operation was prompted by the arrest of two boat 
captains in January 2013. The skippers, both Bretons in their 20s, had 
hired a luxury yacht, the Koo 2 Bool, on the pretext of sailing to the 
Caribbean.

But they were 
stopped by French customs officers off the coast of Normandy, four miles
 from Cherbourg, trying to smuggle 15 Albanians to England.

The sailors are understood to have carried out five or six similar trips across the Channel.

The skippers told police they had been recruited by a Kosovan criminal boss.

A
 French police source said: 'The Kosovan mastermind does not live in 
France. Police had to wait until he returned until they could launch 
their operation. He had only been in St Malo for a few days when 
officers struck.'
