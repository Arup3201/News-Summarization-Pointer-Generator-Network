In even more money: Special Forces soldier-turned-author Andy McNab (above) is expected to make around £1million after Tesco bought an online download site he founded

The race between Britain’s supermarket giants to dominate the electronic books market intensified last night after Tesco struck a £4.5million deal with Bravo Two Zero author Andy McNab.

The grocery goliath has snapped up an online download site founded by former-SAS man in its first foray into the world of e-books.

The secretive Bravo Two Zero author is set to make a killing from the deal, which will net him more than £1m.

Called Mobcast, the firm is an online 
platform where customers can buy and download electronic books onto 
mobile phones and tablet computers.

Until now, Tesco has used a third party to provide its e-books under the grocer’s branding.

But the fact the supermarket is buying
its own platform shows the group is stepping up its efforts in the 
sphere.

Mobcast comes with ready-made agreements with major publishers 
and a back-catalogue of more than 130,000 titles.

Competition between rival supermarkets has heated up over the summer. In June, Sainsbury’s acquired the book downloading site Anobii from HMV for just £1.

The move was seen as an attempt to bolster the company’s fledgling entertainment arm.

Last week, John Lewis won the exclusive rights to sell Barnes & Noble’s reading device the Nook in the UK.

Books read on the Nook or Amazon’s Kindle have to be bought directly from the company that makes the reading device.

What Tesco and Sainsbury’s offer is 
different – it is the chance to buy e-books that can be read on mobile 
devices such as phones and tablet computers.

But the move will still be 
seen as a challenge to Amazon, which corners the market in the UK with 
around 90 per cent of all e-book sales.

Tesco has made a series of recent 
buy-ups in online retailing, including TV streaming service blinkbox in 
2011 and an internet radio service WE7 in June this year.

The drive is fuelled by chief executive Phil Clarke’s enthusiasm for internet selling.

Mobcast will be integrated into Tesco 
over the coming months, although it is not yet known whether the company
will be folded into the Tesco Entertainment label which already sells 
films and music.

Its other co-founder, chief executive 
Tony Lynch, is expected to stay on. Lynch and McNab held a joint stake 
in the venture of 45 per cent, meaning they will each walk away with 
just over £1m.

Tesco shares closed 0.65p lower at 338.8p.
