The winner of a record $590million Powerball jackpot has been revealed to be an 84-year-old widow who had to leave the trailer she bought with her husband 25 years ago to move into a run-down duplex just one year ago, a neighbor revealed to MailOnline.

Gloria C. Mackenzie finally claimed her massive prize today, two weeks after she bought the winning ticket at a Publix supermarket in Zephyhills, Florida.Â 

Mrs Mackenzie will split the winnings with her son Scott, 54, of Jacksonville, Florida. She
 told lottery officials that before she won, she and her son had made an
 agreement to share any proceeds. She was with her son when she bought the winning ticket for the May 18 Powerball drawing.

Mrs Mackenzie has two sons and two daughters and at least four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Most of her family remains in her home state of Maine. It is unknown how, or if, she plans to share the jackpot with them.

Her sons, Larry and Robert, who both still live in Maine, could not be reached for comment.

She has already visited attorneys and accountants in her son's city of Jacksonville to sort out the legal details of the lottery payment, which should arrive by November.

She told lottery officials that she received the lucky numbers -  10,
 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11 - after buying a randomized 
'quick pick' ticket when someone allowed her to cut in line in front of 
her.

Mrs Mackenzie and her son declined to appear for a press conference at lottery headquarters today. She was leaving the building when reporters began arriving. She waded through a herd of TV cameras and journalists without saying a word.

Mrs Mackenzie, 
who was the wife of a machine technician at a Maine paper mill, left the
 trailer park where she spent more than two decades last year so that 
she could move into a low-income housing duplex across the street from a
 cow pasture.

The building was worth just $105,000. Now she can buy the 
entire property more than 2,500 times over.

When Mrs Mackenzie's former neighbor Nancy Williams, 79, learned that she had won millions, she responded: 'Oh bless her heart. Lord knows she could use it, too.'

Not a word: Mrs Mackenzie and her son Scott, right, did not speak to anyone in the media as they filed out of the Florida Lottery headquarters

Larry MacKenzie, whose Facebook page says he's single, likes Nascar and action movies, could not be reached for comment

Mrs Williams lives in the well-kept 
trailer park where Mrs Mackenzie spent 25 years with her husband Ralph. 
She said that Mrs Mackenzie came over every Sunday to visit with her 
neighbor and talk about family.

She said her grown children came to visit several times - even her family still living in Maine.

'She
 never complained about anything. She was very nice and very friendly. 
We'd sit here and talk over an hour every Sunday,' Mrs Williams said.

Mrs Mackenzie bought four other Powerball tickets for the May 18 drawing, but the winning scorecard was her final purchase.

She says a stranger let her cut in line before she purchased the winner ticket.

Scott
 Mackenzie accompanied his mother to Florida Lottery headquarters in 
Tallahassee today to claim her prize. She likely won't see the money 
until November, however.

Mrs Mackenzie opted to take her winnings 
in a single lump sum of $370million before taxes. That will work out to 
about $266million after federal income taxes.

She has not spoken out publicly except to

Mrs Mackenzie is a widow, whose husband 
Ralph died in 2005 at age 79. She has four living children, two of whom live in 
her native state of Maine.

In Maine, her husband worked as an 
instrument technician for the Great Northern Paper Company. After his 
retirement, the two began splitting their times between their hometown 
of East Millinocket, Maine, and Zephyhills, Florida.

Mrs MacKenzie managed to keep her identity secret until today - even through the ticket was sold in a 
tight-knit central Florida town where most year-round residents know 
each others' names.

One previous lottery jackpot was 
larger than the $590million sum - a $656million MegaMillions drawing 
last March - though three tickets matched the winning numbers and had to
 split the prize.
