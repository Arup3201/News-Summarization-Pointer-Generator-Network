Residents in the quiet New York City suburb of Hastings-on-Hudson are angered about the ostentatious $40million mansion being built in their hamlet by a billionaire hedge fund founder.

David E Shaw and his journalist-wife Beth Kobliner purchased three adjoining Hudson-view properties in recent years, and merged them to form an expansive 4.5 acre lot on which to build their 30,000-square-foot modern mansion.

As construction wraps up on the home designed by famous architect Steven Holl, residents in the small town aren't too excited to welcome their new neighbors.

Peter Disolfi, an architect who lives in Hastings, told the New York Times he was 'deeply saddened' that three prewar homes were torn down and replaced by Shaw's mismatched mansion.

'A village is a collection of buildings that relate to each other and to the landscape,' Mr Disolfi, an architecture professor at City College, said. 'Steven Holl is a significant architect and I respect what he does. But it's usually one-off, and relates to itself.'

Holl is famous for his futuristic designs, and recently completed Columbia University's new Campbell Sports Center in Manhattan.

Plans submitted to the Hastings Building Department prove that the home will indeed stick out like a sore thumb in the town with mostly Tudor and and Colonial-style homes.

For starters, the main home will have two dozen sides with a master bedroom shaped like a pentagon.

Other features of the estate include the main home's three exercise rooms, a large underground garage, a reading room, an elevator, a pool house, tennis courts and a separate guest house that will cost $7.9million on its own.

To put the guest house in context, the most expensive home currently listed in the village has an asking price of $1.3million on less than a quarter of an acre.

'It's totally out of character with what Hastings is all about,' said Mark David, a resident of the town for more than 22 years.

The population-8,000 town has become a popular place for young Brooklynites to settle down in recent years, earning it the nickname 'Hipsturbia' in a profile by the Times last year.

Despite their ridiculous wealth, the billionaire couple seem to share certain liberal sensibilities with the townspeople of Hastings.

Shaw and his wife are big donors to the Democratic Party. And Shaw, a computer scientist who once taught at Columbia University, serves on President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.Â 

Kobliner, a personal finance journalist, also advises the president as a member of the Advisory Council on Financial Capability.

But some residents are happy to welcome Shaw, who is worth 3.6billion according to Forbes, for all the tax revenue he will bring in.

Shaw will have to pay more than a million dollars a year in property taxes and three quarters of that bill will go to the school district. The average property tax bill in Hastings is $19,000 making Shaw's contribution the equivalent of 50 new houses.
