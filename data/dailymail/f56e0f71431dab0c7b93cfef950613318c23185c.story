This year has been one of highs and lows for Hilary Clinton.

The former first lady and senator became a grandmother for the first time after her daughter Chelsea gave birth, but she was also the cover of People magazine's lowest-selling issue.

According to a report from AdWeek on Monday, the issue of People featuring Clinton was worst selling of 2014 with 503,890 copies sold.

Hillary Clinton was on the cover for People magazine's worst selling issue this year 

The June 16 cover, featuring Clinton wearing a salmon pink tunic and a bright turquoise beaded necklace, attracted attention when it was published because of Clinton's stance.

Conservative blogger Matt Drudge floated the idea that Clinton was holding a walker in the picture.

When contacted by Business Insider,  Nancy Valentino, a senior vice president of communications at Time Inc., which owns People, replied: 'Secretary Clinton is standing next to a patio chair in the backyard of her home where the photo shoot took place! 

'I have also attached another photo from the shoot - thanks for checking in on this.'

The magazine's best-selling issue - 1,169,800 copies - was the one featuring Robin Williams after his death in late August

The magazine's best-selling issue - 1,169,800 copies - was the one featuring Robin Williams after his death in August.  

Clinton's book Hard Choices, which detailed her time as secretary of state under Obama, also did not sell as well as anticipated - Clinton was reportedly paid a whopping $14 million advance.

But it's not all bad news  - a poll has revealed Clinton is the early frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election.

Although the former Secretary of State has yet to announce her candidacy, 50 per cent of American voters have said they can see themselves supporting her if she runs.

Mrs Clinton, 67, has said she will make her decision on whether or not to run for the White House 2016 early next year. 

The poll found that half of voters support another Clinton president, while 48 per cent oppose it.

Despite only a small margin of support, hers is significantly stronger than that of any rumoured Republican nominees. 

One reason for this could be that Ms Clinton, a former first lady and New York senator  is viewed as the likely Democratic nominee if she runs with few other candidates seen as competition. 

This becomes clear when polling only Democratic voters, where 82 per cent said they could see themselves supporting her if she runs, and only 15 per cent saying they cannot.

One likely Republican opponent Jeb Bush, who announced that he is 'actively exploring' running for President 2016, only has a 31 per cent support, the poll by NBC News/Wall Street Journal said. 

Republican nominee 2012 Mitt Romney fared marginally better with 33 per cent saying they could see themselves supporting him. 

Frontrunner: Half of American voters would support Hillary Rodham Clinton for president if she decides to run for office in 2016, a poll has found

However, 57 percent say they could not support Jeb Bush, the younger brother of George W., while a full 60 per cent said they would not be backing Romney.

Mr Bush took one step further towards the Republican nominee contest yesterday when he announced on Facebook that he will he will 'actively explore the possibility of running'.

Many, both rivals and experts, saw his statement as a de facto announcement that ends months of speculation about his intentions.

The son and brother of presidents, 61-year-old Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is the early favorite of the Republican establishment wing.

His move puts immediate pressure on other establishment-minded GOP contenders to start competing with him for donors, campaign staff and national attention in a crowded field of potential contenders.

In a race likely to include fiery conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Bush will occupy the middle ground despite his overwhelmingly conservative record as Florida's chief executive from 1999 to 2007.

He also gives his party a powerful tool for courting the nation's surging Hispanic population. Bush is married to a Mexican-American, speaks Spanish and has been among the GOP's most outspoken advocates for an immigration overhaul, including a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are living in the country illegally.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren again said yesterday that she's not running for president, regardless of pleas from the progressive base for her to seek the Democratic nomination in 2016.

'You know, I'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance. 

'That's what I'm in this fight for, and I'm in this fight all the way,' Warren told National Public Radio yesterday morning. 

The left-wing politician was careful not to say that she was 'never' running, however, leaving open the possibility of a future candidacy - potentially sooner than she's letting on publicly.
