More than 70 years after they fell on a foreign field, the remains of two World War II heroes have been found by amateur enthusiasts in Italy.

The two unidentified Grenadier Guards died during Operation Avalanche during the Allied landings at Salerno, south west Italy in 1943.

The discovery was made by four World War II part-time historians from the 'Salerno 1943' association who were carrying out a reconnaissance tour of the hilltop.

The soldiers were found buried near one another on land between the villages of Capezzano and Coperchia, a few miles from the beach

Clue: Munitions were found near the skeletal remains

British and American troops landed on 
the beaches at Salerno before beginning a bitter campaign in which the 
ferocity of the German resistance destroyed Churchill’s notion of Italy 
as ‘the soft underbelly’ of the European campaign.

Naples
 eventually fell on 30 September, three weeks after the landing, and the
 campaign diverted German troops from other fronts, bringing D-Day 
closer.

The soldiers, who 
were identified as British from the munitions close by, were found 
buried near one another on land between the villages of Capezzano and 
Coperchia, a few miles from the beach.

The
 two are thought to have died in a Nazi attack, before being hurriedly 
and provisionally buried by the victors as they took control of the 
area.

They will 
probably have been listed as missing in action but it is hoped that 
their relatives can now be traced with DNA testing.

The mayor of Pellezzano Carmine Citro said: ‘Every new discovery needs to be studied carefully in order to be validated properly.

‘But we know our region is rich in historic remains from the second World War. Furthermore, the area of the hill in Picchiocca, has been cited many time in historic documents in Salerno as a place where the entrenched Germans observed the movements of the Allied troops who landed at Salerno. The events also live on in the historic memory of our elder citizens who today will be reminded of those times.’

The military position in question was denominated as ‘Hill 270’ by U.K. military forces, and features in the published memoirs of British soldier Christopher Bulteel.

As told by Bulteel, the hill was easily occupied the day September 22, 1943 by British Grenadiers but not having had the opportunity to entrench themselves and being few in number they were driven back by a counterattack losing many men.

On the 24th the Coldstream Guards, including Bulteel, attacked the enemy position. As they advanced along the slope of the hill, he recalled that the ground was strewn with the bodies of his fallen comrades two days earlier. The battle was hard and there were many casualties on both sides.

Matteo Pierro, one of the four who found the skeletons, said: 'We are in a club of amateur historians so we often go around the battlefield sites with metal detectors.

'In one of these searches on Thursday we came across the two British soldiers.

'The metal detectors started going off when they sensed the munitions, so we started digging. One was in a trench about 30cm below the surface and one was just beneath the top soil.

The group thought at first they could be animal bones but when they realised they were human they called the police.

Antique bookseller Mr Pierro added: 'You know immediately which side they were on. The uniforms had completely decayed but the buttons and buckles were British.'

He said the group had previously found two Nazi soldiers one of whom had been identified.

The tags worn by the Nazi troops were metal, rather than the leather of the British, making them easier to identify.

He added: 'The research could be quite simple though as there are only a limited number of people that are still missing from the battle over two days on this hilltop.'
