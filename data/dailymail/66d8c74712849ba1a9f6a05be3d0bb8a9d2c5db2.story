These daredevil highliners are the ultimate chillseekers - setting up hammocks hundreds of feet in the air.

As they inch their way carefully along the thin wire, some are even happy to pull out a guitar and play some tunes.

The extreme event, called the International Highline Meeting, is in its third year, and takes place at Monte Piana in Italy.

It is a large gathering for fearless folks to hone their skills without any form of competitive edge.

The idea of adding hammocks was put forward by hammock manufacturer Ticket To The Moon.

Highliners attach the materials to a strengthened 'highline' as they walk out to their designated relaxation spots - 150ft high.

Snapper Sebastian Wahlhuetter captured the breath-taking shots as 22 people hopped into 16 hammocks. The meeting ran from 6 to 14 September, with 500 people attending.

Sebastian, who also helped to organise the event, revealed it was difficult to capture his shots due to the remote location and steep, rocky surroundings. He said: 'The action lasted around an hour and it was amazing to see all those people hanging out in their hammocks - it was exciting to watch.

'A special highline set up was rigged so that it could carry the weight of the many people on one line at the same time.

'Monte Piana Highline Festival was definitely the best highline event I have ever photographed.'  

Let's all hang out and do this again: The International Highline Meeting is now a regular event, and will take place again next September

A glorious place for a spot of relaxation on high: This spectacular image gives a hint of what the highliners find so appealing about a day in an elevated hammock

The view up here is smoking: One thrill-seeker shows he is utterly unfazed by his location as he enjoys a cigarette 

It was hard work getting here, let's relax: A group of highliners take in the view in blissful peace and quiet

Feeling cosy: This thrillseeker takes matters to even more extreme lengths by opting for a mini hammock that barely holds his frame

All in a row: The event has been taking place since 2012, and - now into its fourth year - attracts a healthy crowd

Sing when you're winning: One daredevil keeps the afternoon going by playing a few tunes on his guitar

Heading for an early exit: The highliner on the right answers the question of how you get back to solid ground - you inch your way back along the wire

Up up and away: The hammocks look especially beautiful when photographed from the ground below

Time for another tune: Spirits - as well as locations - are high among the highliners as the afternoon progresses

A smile for the camera: The dramatic images were captured by photographer Sebastian Wahlhuetter

Strum enchanted evening: The highline was specially strengthened to ensure it could take the weight of a large number of people at once

Just chill out man: A guitarist strums a tune while all around him the high wire experts relax. But how did he get the guitar there?

Come join! A highline walker heads towards his compadres who rest in a hammock on webbing stretched between rocks in the Italian Alps

Clingon: An extreme athlete makes the walk across a wire strung between the Italian Alps thousands of feet above ground level

Nearly there: After his long walk across this tightrope enthusiast is almost at the other side

Now get back up there: Losing your footing results in the inevitable, but a small safety rope stops this high wire enthusiast from plummeting to his death

Easy does it: A female highliner walks the line strung between rocks in the Alps as part of the gathering near Misurina in northern Italy

Walk the line: A dramatic shot from low down shows three of the highliners criss crossing the gorge

Cosy in there? This highliner is so happy to be resting in his snug hammock he's catching 40 winks

All tgether now, heave! Highliners tighten the webbings between rocks so they can continue to try new routes across the gorge

That's fairly high! This shot shows just how far above the ground these thrill seekers are as they nonchalantly walk across the webbings

Then three came along all at once: Highliners chat to each other, strung hundreds of feet above the ground

And so to bed: A huddle of tents forms the makeshift village for a week as the highliners get some well-deserved sleep before another day of thrill seeking

Those with the nerve spend hours sitting in hammocks, and even playing guitar above the vertigo-inducing drops
