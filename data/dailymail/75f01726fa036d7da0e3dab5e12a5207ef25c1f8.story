Honda has been accused of failing to report more than 1,700 deaths and injuries related to accidents in their vehicles in the US over the past decade.

Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), demanded an explanation as to why Honda failed to fulfil its legal obligation to report deaths and injuries, especially those involving air bags.

Honda responded by claiming there had been 'various errors related to data entry', which had resulted in failing to notify safety regulators of 1,729 claims of
injuries and deaths related to accidents in its vehicles since
2003.

The Japanese automaker said in a statement that its count of
underreported claims came from a third-party audit. 

Honda cited
'various errors related to data entry' and said it used an
'overly narrow interpretation' of its legal reporting
requirements. It said it is taking steps to remedy these
shortcomings.

'I haven't got a detailed report yet, but it seems there
were a lot of administrative mistakes on the ground,' Honda CEO
Takanobu Ito said, speaking at a corporate event in Japan on Tuesday. 

Honda and Japanese supplier Takata Corp have been
at the center of investigations of defects in Takata air bags. 

Since 2008, Honda has recalled more than 7.5 million U.S. cars
because defects can cause the inflators in some Takata air bags
to rupture, spraying metal shards into vehicle occupants.

Asked what Honda had made of an early, pre-recall Takata air
bag accident, in 2004, Ito said: 'We don't have knowledge of
inflators but ... it was difficult to foresee that it would
expand' to similar accidents or recalls.

NHTSA sent a second order to Honda on November 5th, seeking
details and documents related to the air bags and
inflators.

Honda sent its response on Monday to NHTSA's first order. A
summary of that response was read out by Rick Schostek,
executive vice president of Honda North America, on a conference
call with reporters, though he declined to take questions.
Schostek testified last week at a U.S. Senate Commerce Committee
hearing on Takata air bags.

In the 'early warning' reporting data required by U.S. law,
Honda failed to disclose eight incidents of ruptured Takata
inflators that resulted in one death and seven injuries,
Schostek said. The company said it provided details of those
incidents to NHTSA outside the 'early warning' reporting
process. 

Japanese Transport Minister Akihiro Ohta said on Tuesday his
ministry set up a task force late last week to deal specifically
with Takata's recalls. The ministry is also looking into whether
Honda underreported incidents in Japan, an official said.

Separately on Monday, a lawsuit was filed in South Carolina
federal court tying a Takata air bag to the 2008 death of Mary
Lyon Wolfe in a 2002 Honda Accord. The lawsuit said the air bag
in Wolfe's car 'deployed with excessive force' and caused grave
injuries. Wolfe died 18 days later from her injuries, it noted.

A Takata spokesman declined to comment. A Honda spokesman
said the company had not yet been served with a copy of the
lawsuit and declined to comment on its specifics.

Also on Monday, the Senate requested additional air
bag-related documents from Takata 'to gather information that
could address questions left unanswered' at last week's hearing.
