The finish to the final stage of the Tour de France here in England proved fairly predictable. With Mark Cavendish already out of the race with injury, it was left to the powerfully built German, the imperious Marcel Kittel, to burst away from the peloton for the second time in three days to secure victory on The Mall. 

Just across to where the team vehicles were gathered on Horseguard’s Parade, however, it was rather more chaotic. 

Emergency repair works on the Eurotunnel had the 22 teams in something of a panic - the riders might have been flying to France on Monday night but talk of ‘six hour delays’ had them concerned their bikes might be delayed - while Sir Dave Brailsford had a public relations issue to deal with.

Earlier on Mondau Team Sky’s team 
principal had been quoted in a French newspaper interview stating that 
it was his intention to deliver a first French winner of the Tour in 
more than 30 years.

The 
French would certainly appreciate it, given it has not been since 
Bernard Hinault in 1985 that they saw one of their own in yellow on the 
Champs Elysees. But surely it isn’t the job of Mr British cycling, 
indeed the man who until April was also performance director of the 
British squad, to end that particular wait.

After
 masterminding Great Britain’s Olympic cycling success, Brailsford 
created a ‘British’ pro team at Team Sky with the sole intention of 
delivering a first British Tour winner. It was central to his mission 
statement at the launch of Team Sky in February 2009 and something he 
duly delivered with Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and then followed with 
Chris Froome last year. 

But in an interview with the French sports daily, L’Equipe, Brailsford said: ‘Yes, I would like to win with a French rider.

‘I think it needs to happen. For the Tour, for France, for the French, for the sport, having a French winner would be massive.’

A
 fluent French speaker, Brailsford may be guilty of nothing more than 
trying to please his audience the day before the Tour rolls into France.

But
 after welcoming his riders back to the team bus he insisted delivering 
British winners remained his priority. ‘Let’s clear that up right now,’ 
he said. ‘My focus is on doing everything I can to support Team Sky 
riders to be on the podium and to help Chris to win this race. 

‘The comment was more about a national event, if it’s won by the same nation’s rider, what a fantastic thing that can be.’ 

He
 then agreed it was ‘tremendously important’ to have a British rider 
leading Sky’s challenge. ‘With Chris, we’ve got a fantastic lead rider, 
and we see other young British riders developing as well,’ he said. 

‘I’ve worked for 15 years to try to put British Cycling on the map and I hope to continue to do that.’ 

That
 said, he did apply a touch of realism to the situation. ‘There are only
 five or six guys in the world who can win the Tour,’ he said. 

‘It’s a British team with a British heart, but the team has become more global, there’s no doubt about it.’

To
 maintain that British heart Brailsford said attempts were being made to
 extend Wiggins’ contract with Sky until the Rio Olympics in 2016, even 
though he was not selected for this Tour. ‘We'd like him to continue 
with us,’ he said. But reports also persist of Sky’s pursuit of the 
promising French rider, Warren Barguil. 

Brailsford
 said he rather hoped to see the Tour return to these shores after a 
brilliant three days’ racing, even if London’s weather proved somewhat 
damper than the sunshine the riders enjoyed on the Cote De Yorkshire. 
Transport for London nevertheless estimated that a million people had 
lined the streets of the capital alone to see Giant-Shimano deliver 
Kittel to perfection after 155km of racing from Cambridge.

could be even better next time.
