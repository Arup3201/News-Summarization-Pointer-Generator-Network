Lee Cattermole was 17 years old when he was sat in a hotel on Newcastle's Quayside and Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren told him he would be making his debut later that day at St James' Park.

The fearless teen duly started, helped Boro to a 2-2 draw and walked away with man-of-the-match honours having been in opposition to the likes of Alan Shearer.

Fast forward nine years and Cattermole is still to win on Tyneside. He was part of the Sunderland side smashed 5-1 and was sent off on his last appearance there, dismissed for dissent after the full-time whistle of a 1-1 draw.

Consolation can be taken from successive 3-0 victories for Sunderland, but Cattermole was in the stands rather than on the pitch.

Today, the North-East Footballer of the Year has the chance to make his own mark.

'With making my debut there it's a special ground for me and I've got good memories of there, barring the 5-1,' he said.

'I think it's a good ground, good atmosphere, it's a place I look forward to going to.

'Before the 5-1 we were flying at the time and we went into it doing really well. We were confident that year but a lot of the team hadn't played in the derby and a lot underperformed on the day.

'We've got a lot of lads still here from that day and we've been happier in recent years. We've had the upper hand since then.' Remedy after that drubbing in 2010 was sought at the bottom of a pint glass, on the instruction of manager Steve Bruce.

Cattermole recalled: 'Brucey got us in the next day and to be fair to the manager he said, 'Clear the decks. Take tomorrow off and get out and do whatever you want as a team. Get out and try and switch off'.

'We got together as a group, we went out and had a chat and a few beers and the next week we responded well and got on a good run. The manager handled it well.' 

Jack Colback will be playing for Newcastle on Sunday, but used to play alongside Cattermole at Sunderland

Cattermole and Co will be hoping they're enjoying a celebratory tipple this time around. The Black Cats would make their own piece of derby history with a fourth straight win over the Magpies.

Newcastle's Jack Colback was part of the Sunderland team which won 3-0 last season and scored the final goal at the Gallowgate End.

He and Cattermole were partners in midfield as Gus Poyet's side pulled off last year's Great Escape before his defection to St James'.

Cattermole admits his former team-mate has been a miss.

'Jack's a good friend and good player. We've missed him,' he said. 'That's been a bit of a loss for us. He made a decision to move on and good luck to him.

'I think if he'd gone to any other club he would have got a good reception because he did well for Sunderland.

'Obviously, where he's chosen to go to, it's going to be difficult for the fans to take.' 

Colback, though, has not dominated conversation in the red-and-white dressing-room.

'We're maybe talking more about the chance to win our fourth derby on the trot, which would be massive,' said Cattermole.

'It's a good feeling going there. There's a bit of a rough reception and that's nice. It's different, it's a big game and, as a group of players, you have to embrace it and just enjoy it.' Cattermole would certainly enjoy his first taste of victory at the ground where his career began.
