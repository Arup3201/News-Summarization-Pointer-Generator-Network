Tuttosport splash with the headline 'Pogba 2019', claiming Juve general manager Beppe Marotta and the player's agent Mino Raiola are close to agreeing a renewed contract that will see the 21-year-old's wages increase to €3.2m per season, plus another €1m bonuses.

The paper also claim that Mario Balotelli has one month to impress new manager Pippo Inzaghi at AC Milan, while local rivals Inter are planning a swap deal for Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez with Freddy Guarin moving in the opposite direction.

Corriere dello Sport also lead with 'Golden Pogba', although they claim the contract extension will only keep the player at Juventus until 2018. According to the paper, the Old Lady also want Chelsea misfit Romelu Lukaku and Southampton bad boy Dani Osvaldo to lead their attack this season.

Finally, another Manchester United target Edinson Cavani has apparently split ties with PSG forcing a bidding war for his services.
