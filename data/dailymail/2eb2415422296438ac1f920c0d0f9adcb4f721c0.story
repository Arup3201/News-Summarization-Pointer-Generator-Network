The Catholic priest who quit after getting a woman pregnant has revealed that the mother of his child was a member of his congregation and he now thinks that the Church should allow priests to marry.

Father Daniel McFalls left his post at St Mary's in Stockton, California after making the shocking announcement to his parish that he was going to be a first-time father.

The baby- a boy, named Daniel Gabriel- has since been born and the former priest is speaking out about how he feels the Church needs to change with the times.

New kind of Father: Daniel 'Dean' McFalls announced that he was stepping down as a Catholic priest because he got one of his parishioners pregnant and will be helping raise the baby boy

'It's sad I had to choose between caring for this child and all the people I care for at our church. It's sad I was put in that position,' he told The New York Daily News.

'I know I'm not worthy to be speaking publicly about this because I'm a sinner, but I hope this might help the Catholic Church to look more deeply at the possibility of finding some way to open the door to a married priesthood.'

One of those parishioners who was particularly close to his heart was the mother of his newborn child.

He has not revealed her name, but said that she is a 'discreet' member of his church.

'When that little baby was born at 5.22am, it was the happiest moment of my life, along with my ordination,' he told the news site.

'Nothing on earth equals the joy I feel when I see his little face. When you hold a baby, you know that child contains the whole universe. You see the eyes of God looking back at you saying, "Where do you stand?"'

Pushing for change: Though he knows he will be viewed as a sinner, he feels that the Church laws should change so that priests could be fathers and in the clergy

St. Mary of The Assumption Parish will have to find a new priest after the sudden resignation

The news about the impending childbirth came from a letter sent to the church and read to his congregation.

McFalls said: 'A child will soon be born, and I am the baby’s father. I know this comes as a shock to you, and to many a disappointment.

'I assume full responsibility for my actions and will do all that I can so that my child receives the care and love that he deserves.

'As St. Paul told the “Romans: ‘God makes all things work together for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his decree,’ and though the Lord never decreed that I sin, he does command that all life be respected and nurtured.'

McFalls' was given an indefinite leave of absence by Bishop Stephen E. Blaire, head of the Diocese of Stockton, and will now have to decide if he wants to remain a priest.

One member of his congregations has said she is glad he is gone, calling him 'flirty.'

Diana Garcia, who has attended the church for 15 years, told Fox News: 'He’s gone after girls before and he’s gone after my daughters.'

'He’s just lustful, he didn’t say he was in love or marry the girl, no.

'It’s not about being a sinner, it’s about playing with God, he made a vow, this is a priest we’re talking about.'
