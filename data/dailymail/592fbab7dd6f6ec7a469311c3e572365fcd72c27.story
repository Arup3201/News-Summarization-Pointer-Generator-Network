A group of university feminists who had sexist abuse hurled at them have turned the insults into an attack on their bullies by calling themselves The Ugly Girls Club.

The students at Royal Holloway University in Surrey were holding a talk about sexual consent at their student union when they overheard themselves being called 'The Ugly Girls Club.'  

But instead of letting the slurs get them down, they re-branded themselves The Ugly Girls Club and started a Twitter and Facebook campaign to reclaim the word ugly, tweeting pictures of themselves pulling unattractive faces with the hashtag #uglygirlsclub.   

Royal Holloway University feminists did a sexual consent talk in their union and overheard fellow students calling them Ugly Girls Club. They re-branded #uglygirlsclub and tweeted comedy ugly selfies

The social media site has since been flooded with hundreds of photos from supporters, both male and female, across the nation.

Alex Vosper pulled down her lower eye lids, pouted her lips and tweeted 'proud to be hideous'.

And Elena Barnard drooped her face, crossed her eyes and wrote 'sometimes I look cracking and sometimes I say stuff that's cracking. The stuff I say lasts longer'.

One picture from Daniel Tremor showed him posing with a sign saying 'I'd rather be 'ugly' than a sexist w*****'.

The campaign aims to: 'Challenge conventional beauty standards and superficial judgement'

Natasha Barrett, the feminist society president at Royal Holloway University of London, in Egham, Surrey, said the funny selfies carry a serious message.

Speaking to student newspaper the Tab, she said: 'The aim of the campaign is to empower people to not just think of their worth in physical terms. 

'The selfies were tongue in cheek to start with but they carry a serious message too.'

The Royal, Holloway feminist society started the Twitter campaign to reclaim the word ugly. Hundreds of supporters from across UK have now messaged selfies in response

She continued: 'There are some fantastic student feminist campaigns around at the moment like 'Reclaim Your Campus' and the National Union of Students 'Lad Culture' campaign - anything that helps draw attention to these issues is great.

'One student said that the campaign had given her a confidence boost and that she was never going to delete her 'unsatisfactory' selfies ever again, and that's exactly the kind of response we want.

'Women have enough self-esteem problems as it is - if this campaign can go a little way to help combat that then we're happy.'
