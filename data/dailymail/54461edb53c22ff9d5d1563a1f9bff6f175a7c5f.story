A British Airways plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport shortly after takeoff last night after an 'engine surge'.

A witness on the ground said flames could be seen 'spitting out' of an engine and that the Airbus A319, bound for Lyon in France, was making 
spluttering noises as it was taking off.

The plane was forced to turn back to Heathrow Airport and landed safely following the incident at around 9pm.

Grounded: BA was forced to make an emergency landing after an engine surge on an Airbus A319

Tom Puttick, who works near Heathrow told the BBC: 'I was in the petrol station opposite the airport which is when I heard the bang, so I turned around and the airplane had flames spitting out of the engine with a spluttering noise as it was taking off.

'I then watched it continue to climb and the engine was still emitting flames intermittently. Lots of blue lights then emerged on the airport while the plane, I guess, turned around to make an emergency landing.'

A BA spokeswoman said: 'A flight experienced what's known as an "engine surge" as it took off from Heathrow, but it returned and touched down safely.

'Our crew cared for our customers on-board and kept them informed. We train our pilots to the very highest standards including how to respond to these type of events, and the engine was immediately shut down.'

She went on: 'Of course, we gave our customers who were on the flight hotel accommodation last night and they have been rebooked to fly today.

'We have also scheduled a larger aircraft to operate to Lyon to ensure we can get all our customers there as soon as possible. We can understand how frustrating the delay to their plans must be.

'The aircraft is being thoroughly checked over by engineers. The safety of our customers, crew and aircraft is of the utmost importance to British Airways.'
