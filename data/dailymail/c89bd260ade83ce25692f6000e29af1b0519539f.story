Clattering through the air like skittles cleaned up by a bowling ball, these Portuguese forcados really struggled to grab the bull by the horns.

The huge, black beast appears to be coming out very much on top as it brushes aside the unarmed bullfighters - despite the fact that it has been stabbed in the back of the neck with three javelins.

The bull knocked several of the Vila Franca Xira forcados group head over heels during the event at the Campo Pequeno bullring in Lisbon yesterday.

Dressed in their ornate jackets and knee-high socks, the fighters looked like little more than plastic toy soldiers as they were tossed around the ring.

Portuguese bullfighting differs from the Spanish method as it involves eight forcados tackling the bull bare-handed, while Spanish matadors are armed and have their traditional red cape.

The Portuguese tradition also says that the bull should not be killed in the ring - though it is usually led off out of the audience's sight to be slaughtered after the fight.

A Portuguese bullfight starts with the cavaleiro - an armed horseman - stabbing the bull in the back with javelins to weaken it.

It then tackled the forcados, who try and provoke it to charge in the hope of eventually grabbing it by the head and subduing it.  

Double strike: The huge, black bull clatters two of the forcados into the air as they try and grab it by the head in the hope of subduing it

Head over heels: One of the bullfighters is flipped over by the beast as he makes as grab for its horns, while the others run in worriedly to assist

Ten-pin bulling: The bull knocks a shoe off one of the fighters as four more stand in wait behind him - the next in line screaming out in fear

Head-to-head: The bull and a brave forcado tackle each other head on as the seven other fighters spot a chance to jump in and grab the animal

Brushed aside: The bull has absolutely no trouble in swiping away a lone forcado, despite the three javelins sticking deep into the back of its neck

Seizing the opportunity: As one fighters is tackled to the floor, two more of the unarmed men step in to try to grab it by the head and take it down

Hold on tight! A forcado grabs onto the bull's head and holds on for dear life as the beast tries to flip him angrily onto the sand

You're pulling my tail: A bullfighter with a ripped jacket attempts to stop the bull from behind as another scarpers off quickly in the other direction

Time to kick back: The forcados relax after the fight, with one lighting a cigarette to calm his nerves after being tossed all over the Lisbon ring

Unlike Spanish matadors, Portuguese bullfighters are unarmed, and the bull is not killed in the ring
