Profits at Tesco slumped by 51 per cent last year as  it wrote off £1.2billion on a failed attempt to conquer the United States.

The fall in pretax profits – down by £2billion to £1.96billion – was its first in 20 years.

It is to close or sell its Fresh & Easy convenience store chain in the US in what is an ignominious failure for Britain’s biggest retailer.

Worrying: Profits at Tesco slumped by 51 per cent last year as it wrote off £1.2billion on a failed attempt to conquer the United States

The supermarket giant is also scrapping more than 100 store developments in the UK as customers switch to shopping online.

That move saw the value of its vast land bank, much of it bought during the property boom, written down by £804million.

It will now sell many sites that it had earmarked for large hypermarkets for less than it previously believed the land was worth.

The figures were outlined yesterday by chief executive Philip Clarke, who is leading a £1billion plan to revamp its stores, improve food lines, hire extra staff and improve customer service.

This is part of a shift to concentrate on
building sales through existing UK stores and through its website with 
home deliveries and its click and collect service.

Tesco is also trying to escape its 
reputation as a faceless giant by buying the family friendly restaurant 
chain Giraffe, and investments in the coffee shop chain  Harris + Hoole 
and the bakery business Euphorium.

It seems outlets under these banners will be opened in some of its large Extra hypermarkets to make a visit more of a day out than a chore.

The exit from the US and the decision to scale back store building suggests Mr Clarke is effectively burning much of the legacy of his predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, who left in March 2011.

Leaving aside the special one-off costs, underlying profits relating to day to day sales still fell by 14.5 per cent to £3.55billion, according to the latest annual accounts published yesterday.

The decision to pull out of the US is not the only failure on the international front, for Tesco also revealed problems with trading and expansion in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey.

Fresh & Easy opened its first outlet in Hemet, California, on November 1, 2007.

It was to be the first of 1,000  convenience stores that would bring British supermarket shopping to  US consumers.

Just as Wal-Mart of the US had bought the Asda chain in the UK, so Tesco
would now challenge the American giant in its own backyard.

Three booming states – California, Arizona and Nevada – were picked for 
the launch. But within two years, they had become among the worst hit by
the sub-prime mortgage crisis, which led to the financial crash.

Tesco hit: The group confirmed plans to pull its Fresh & Easy business in the U.S. and reported its first fall in full-year group profits for two decades

Tesco poured £1billion into the venture, but it has never turned a 
profit during more than five years of trading. Only 199 stores were 
opened.

Americans were put off by the stark aisles, plastic wrapped fruit and 
veg, ready meals and self-service check-outs in a country where bagging 
up groceries for struggling shoppers is a customer service essential.

At
the same time, it was unclear whether the chain was presenting itself 
as a budget option or a place for aspiring shoppers to buy high quality 
food and drink.

In the UK, a growing number of shoppers buy their groceries online or 
via smartphone, but in the US very few families shop in this way.

Fresh & Easy, which employs some 5,000 people, was the brainchild of
former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, who sent his most senior 
lieutenant, Tim Mason, to run it.

Despite Mr Mason’s expertise, the venture failed to take off and he quit
the US business last December with a pay-off reported to be 
£5.7million.

Now, Tesco has appointed a US firm to try to find a buyer for the whole 
business or some of the stores. US rival Trader Joe’s is expected to buy
all the stores in California and Nevada.

Phil Dorrell, director of retail consultants Retail Remedy, said: ‘This grim set of numbers shows that even Tesco is mortal.

‘From day one, Fresh & Easy was an 
unmitigated disaster for Tesco.

Boss: Tesco's Chief Executive Philip Clarke spoke of 'natural consequences of strategic changes'

It is retreating from the States with 
its tail firmly between its legs.

‘Even without the Fresh & Easy 
debacle the supermarket would probably still have seen its profits fall 
for the first time in 20 years.

Tesco took its eye off the ball in 
spectacular fashion and, in its goal to be a world-beater, forgot to 
take care of the basics.’

Tesco
said the investment in improving stores and customer service in this 
country is already bearing fruit.

But the business was among the big 
losers from the horse meat scandal after it was forced to remove many 
contaminated products from sale.

Chief
executive Mr Clarke said: ‘The announcements made today are natural 
consequences of the strategic changes we began over a year ago and which
conclude today.

‘Tesco already looks, feels and acts like a different and better business.’
