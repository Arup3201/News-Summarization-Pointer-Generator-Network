Architects in Oklahoma have planned a skyscraper for the city of Tulsa shaped called Tornado Tower.

The city, which sits in Tornado Alley and sees a large number of the tower's namesake weather events, has been looking for a building to rejuvenate an area that currently holds a part-time garage.

Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc, an architecture firm based in Tulsa, was approached by a local magazine to come up with an idea, and has now unveiled the concept for the Tornado Tower, which would hold a severe weather museum and research center.

Architecture firm Kinslow, Keith and Todd Inc have designed a building for downtown Tulsa called the Tornado Tower

Architect Andrew Kinslow told Daily Mail Online that the plan 'has kind of taken on a life of its own' after it was released late last month.

Plans for the funnel cloud-shaped tower currently range from 20 to 30 stories, and would multiple floors would feature outdoor terraces.

Mr Kinslow said that the garden floors were designed to look like tree debris being carried away by the twister.

The building's similarities to its real-life counterpart also include LED lights on the outside that would be spaced to give drivers on a nearby highway the illusion that the structure was spinning. 

A restaurant on the top floor would also spin counter-clockwise, the direction of tornadoes.

Mr Kinslow said that they have been contacted by multiple potential investors interested in finding out more details about the project.

The firm says that the reaction has been largely positive and that two Tulsa City Councillors have already voiced support.

While the design of the building may make it look likely to be blown over in the famously strong Oklahoma winds, its creators say the structure would be stable.

A solid core would go up the middle of the building with elevators and bathrooms, according to Fox23.

The building would also feature a 360-degree rotating restaurant on its top floor,  and the revolving action seems appropriate given the tower's swirling inspiration.

Architects say office space could be easily added and classrooms in its base could help teach visitors about weather safety.

'If you think of St Louis, you think of the Arch. In Seattle, you think of the Space Needle. Tulsa's one of those places where nobody thinks of anything but Indians and dust. And well, maybe tornadoes,' Kinslow said.

Tornado Tower, which does not yet have a client to build it, would be held up by a strong core section with elevators. It would be located near the BOK Center (left), a 19,000-seat arena

Tornado Tower would be visible from most of the downtown Tulsa area, and the architect said his team was looking to make 'an elegant looking building'.

The state of Oklahoma saw more than 80 tornadoes in 2013, though the number did not reach the 145-tornado record set in 1999, according to the National Weather Service.

On top of the tower there would be a terrace designed for reporters to do weather broadcasts. 

Tulsa's skyline features a number of skyscrapers that would remain taller than the proposed Tornado Tower, including the 52-story Bank of Oklahoma Tower that was designed by the same architects who built the original World Trade Centers.

The new tower would be located near BOK Center, the 19,000-seat home of the Tulsa Oilers.

Kinslow said that discussions have also been had about moving the prospective building to a different area with more ground space.
