A group of grandmothers have become a YouTube sensation with a hilarious song attacking Republican Congressman Todd Akin over his 'legitimate rape comments'.

The group, who call themselves the Renegade Raging Grannies, were incensed by Akin's suggestion that anyone who claims to have been impregnated by rape could not have really been sexually assaulted.

In an interview on a St. Louis television station Akin, who is running for senator in Missouri, was asked why he doesn't support legalising abortion in cases where a woman gets pregnant as a result of rape.

Grey power: The Renegade Raging Grannies hit out at Republican Congressman Todd Akin in their hilarious YouTube song

'From what I understand from doctors,
that's really rare,' Akin said of a woman becoming pregnant from rape. 
'If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that
whole thing down.

'But
let's assume maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should 
be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist.'

Under fire: Congressman Akin was the favourite to become the next Missouri senator until he made his remarks

Akin later apologised for his words and 
said he misspoke. However, he has refused to removed himself from the 
race, despite pleas from some Republicans.

President Obama and Republican 
presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, have both condemned Akin's remarks 
making it clear they believe 'rape is rape'.

Now
the National Republican Senatorial Committee - the party organization 
dedicated to winning back control of the US Senate -- has pulled its 
support for Akin and said it will not spend the $5million it planned to 
shell out for the senate race.

His
opponent, Sen. Claire McCaskill has expressed her desire for Akin to 
stay in the race, though that may be because he could now prove a lesser
adversary.

The grannies use
some choice language to get their point across including:'If we are 
raped we can rest unafraid. Cause we can’t get pregnant if forcibly 
laid.'

They finish the song by flipping Akin a one-fingered salute and telling him where to go in the strongest of terms.

The group is part of the Raging Grannies organisation - female senior citizens who raise awareness of an array of social issues.

In the past they have taken on greedy bankers, weapons proliferation and have attacked Apple computers over working conditions.

'Legitimate rape' is great birth control.

So says Todd Akin, and he oughta know.

If we are raped we can rest unafraid,

'Cause we can’t get pregnant if forcibly laid.

Our female bodies are clever that way,

We only get pregnant when we say 'okay.'

Doctors have told him, so it must be so,

The stork only comes if we don’t say 'No!'

Rape won’t make babies and that is a fact;

There’s no global warming; the Earth’s really flat.

We heard it on FOX News so it must be true.

Well, Mr. Akin, we say 'F*** YOU!'
