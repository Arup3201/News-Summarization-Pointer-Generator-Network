New York Police Department detectives have a 50-year-old murder case  on their hands after the medical examiner ruled an elderly Brooklyn man's death to be due to a stabbing from the 1950s.

Antonio Ciccarello passed away at the age of 97 in September, more than five decades after being stabbed in the stomach in the Lower East Side on his way to work.

The New York Daily News reports the family was shocked when their father turned up in the morgue, instead of a funeral home, with his death ruled a homicide.

Death: Antonio Ciccarello died at 97, more than five decades after being stabbed in the stomach in the Lower East Side on his way to work, and the medical examiner has ruled it a murder

'It was way out of left field for me,' said his daughter Mary Paloglou, 57, who thought the hernia that finally killed her father was caused by strain inflicted on the job as a porter.

But the medical examiner said the hernia was lasting damage resulting from  Ciccarello being blindsided with a knife on the streets of New York.

Paloglou said she'd heard stories about how her father was stabbed, when she was around three, but had no idea the extent of the attack. 

In the 1950s, an unknown assailant jumped Ciccarello on the street. He got away from his attacker and went to the hospital after the pain became unbearable, only then learning he'd been stabbed.

Doctors left a scar on his stomach after performing an operation on him to fix any internal bleeding the stabbing may have caused.

The internal injuries he suffered eventually led to his death half a century later, according to the city medical examiner.

Passed away: Ciccarello refused an operation on his hernia last year because he was worried he wouldn't survive the surgery in his advanced age

His daughter said he never reported the attack to police since he didn't know the identity of the perpetrator, and that the person who committed the assault is now likely passed away as well.

'It could of been a bum in the street,' said Paloglou. 'It was just a random act. He wasn't robbed.' 

Ciccarello refused an operation on the hernia last year because he was worried he wouldn't survive the surgery in his advanced age.

'We were afraid that he was going to die on the table,' said Paloglou.
