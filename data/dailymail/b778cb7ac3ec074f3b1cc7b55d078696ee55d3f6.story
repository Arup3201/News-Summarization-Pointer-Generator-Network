Had David Moyes been manager of any other major club in Europe, there is every chance he would be out of his job now.

The powerhouses, from Chelsea to Real Madrid to Bayern Munich, do not suffer the kind of season Manchester United have endured without taking ruthless action, and defeat like the one against Olympiacos would have been the end for Moyes anywhere else.

Chelsea, remember, sacked Andre Villas-Boas after a dreadful 3-1 defeat against Napoli at the same stage of the Champions League two years ago.

Gone: Chelsea showed no mercy to Andre Villas-Boas when they sacked him after a run of bad form

United, however, are different. Like Liverpool and Arsenal, they do things in what I believe to be the right way. History shows they do not panic or make kneejerk reactions: even Tommy Docherty was not sacked when United were relegated to the old second division in 1974.

But just because United have not panicked doesn’t mean they won’t be anxious and nobody knows what the Glazer family are thinking. Moyes deserves until Christmas to show he can be a success but, as a wise football man, he will be aware losing makes positions become untenable. 

Watching United labour against Olympiacos brought back memories of the situation Roy Hodgson experienced in his brief stay at Liverpool in 2010; the shock home defeats, the unexpected cup exits and certain players letting the manager down badly.  

The way Robin van Persie, for instance, is playing reminds me of the way Fernando Torres was with Hodgson. His goal record might be good, as was Torres’ for Hodgson, but the quotes that he has made and the stories surrounding him make it feel like Van Persie isn’t behind Moyes.

He didn’t miss a game last season in the Barclays Premier League but this year he has been in and out – is he thinking about the World Cup? – while his demeanour has served only to increase the perception there are problems. Torres did exactly the same.

If a manager loses his players, there is often no way back and an issue Moyes has to contend with at the moment is the fact he is the focus of the criticism; United’s players will know this and can hide behind that, rather than looking at their own shortcomings. Again, that happened with Hodgson.

To see Moyes now, he looks shell-shocked. The Moyes I knew at Everton would never have been so amenable in television interviews after seeing his side perform as badly as United did in Greece.

When he was at Everton, you would see the anger in his face and his answers would be short. You knew he felt let down by his team but, equally, you knew he would drag a response out of his team.

Setback: Everton were comprehensively beaten by Wigan in the FA Cup last year under Moyes

Response: But Everton stunned Manchester City just seven days later in the Premier League

Last season, after losing to Wigan in the FA Cup, Everton beat Manchester City 2-0 seven days later.

That ability to galvanise was one of Moyes’ great strengths. A year earlier, after Liverpool had beaten them in the FA Cup semi-final, Everton responded the following week with a 4-4 draw at Old Trafford, having looked dead and buried. He wouldn’t accept his team just falling away.

Before the game in Greece he spoke about United being compact but the team he picked had two wingers and two strikers – if a manager plays that system and gets a result, he is regarded as brave. If it backfires, he is naive. 

It is almost as if he’s caught between the Manchester United way and his own mentality. He is not a front-foot manager – that is not a criticism, as neither is Jose Mourinho – but there doesn’t look to be any fizz or fight about United. They don’t look to be one thing or the other.

I’d go as far as to say this is the slowest United side I have seen and in Piraeus they looked like a team of old men coming to the end. Facing United used to be unnerving, as you never knew how they would play.

If they wanted to pass you to sleep, they would do it without a problem. But if they wanted to pick you off on the break, they had the speed and cutting edge to shred you to pieces. The two signings of Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini won’t change that, as they don’t have pace.

Moyes, it must be said, is also having no luck – the deliberate deflection that aided Olympiacos's first goal epitomised how things are going – and he has said that often in press conferences - but is he just genuinely unlucky or is he a manager who comes up short? 

He did a magnificent job at Preston and took them to the brink of the Premier League before losing the play-off final against Bolton in 2001; the work he did in reviving Everton was beyond question but in those legacy-defining games – Villarreal (2005), Chelsea (2009), Liverpool (2012) – it was just one hurdle too many.  

It is not unusual, of course, for managers to have poor first seasons at big clubs before turning things round. Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez (Istanbul apart!) and Brendan Rodgers all found life difficult at Anfield but there was no sense they were ever in trouble.

They were given the confidence and belief to build their projects and that is what United are doing with Moyes. Deep down, though, he and his board will know they can’t keep on losing. He needs an attention-grabbing victory, the kind United used to achieve regularly, to settle the nerves.

Nothing beats winning a cup final

During Norwich’s game with Tottenham last Sunday, an award was made on the pitch to Ken Brown.

As he’d just celebrated his 80th birthday, he’d been invited back for the day and was given a thunderous ovation.

Brown is held in great affection at Carrow Road because he was the manager who led Norwich to victory in the League Cup in 1985. Norwich were also relegated that season but that did not change Brown’s place in the affections of their supporters.

Stuff dreams are made of: Norwich's Mick Channon and manager Ken Brown celebrate at Wembley in 1985

Would Brown have been invited back had Norwich’s campaign in 1984-85 simply ended with them staying up and not winning a trophy?

Football is all about the moments Norwich experienced 29 years ago and tomorrow Gus Poyet has a chance to achieve something similar with Sunderland, the club who were on the receiving end of Brown’s greatest day.

They go into the Capital One Cup final in the bottom three but Poyet’s squad can put themselves alongside Jim Montgomery and Ian Porterfield, the heroes of the 1973 FA Cup-winning team, if they pull off the shock of the season and beat Manchester City.

I understand that huge financial 
rewards nowadays have changed how the game is perceived but the glorious
 moments, like Brown’s boys of 1985 and Ben Watson and Wigan last May in
 the FA Cup, must continue to be what we love about football.

The
 game is about winning things; that’s what you dream of when you are a 
kid, of running around Wembley with a cup. I played in the Premier 
League and in Europe all my career but nothing can beat the feeling of 
parading a trophy with your supporters at the end of a final.

If Sunderland are relegated in May but beat Manchester City on Sunday, I know which memory will last longer 30 years from now.

My top five... things to keep me busy

I thought when I stopped playing that I would have more time on my hands but, if anything, I’ve been even busier than before.

1 Going to Twickenham – I’ve taken an interest in rugby union since I was bowled over by the intensity of the Lions tour last summer and last week I got to sample my first live game. It was a great experience seeing England beat Ireland 13-10 at Twickenham and the atmosphere was fantastic. I will certainly be going back in the future.

2 Pulling on my boots... again – I thought my appearance in Steven Gerrard’s testimonial last August would be my final game but I’m appearing in the ‘Match against Poverty’ in Switzerland this Wednesday. Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luis Figo and Robert Pires head an all-star cast and I’m looking forward to the game.

3 Reading about Iron Mike – Mike Tyson is one of the most fascinating sportsmen of the modern generation and, as was the case when he was in the ring, there are no punches pulled in his autobiography The Undisputed Truth. I like reading sports books and this is one of the best I’ve read in a while.

Pulling no punches: Mike Tyson was the youngest ever heavyweight champion of the world

Read all about it: Tyson has written an explosive autobiography about his life in and outside of the ring

4 Reminiscing in Dublin – I made a flying visit to Ireland with Didi Hamann on Thursday for a night in the Olympia Theatre, talking about our careers at Liverpool and, of course, that night in Istanbul. As you would expect, there was a lively crowd and a good night was had by all.

5 Keeping an eye on England – International friendlies might not be to everyone’s interest but I will be watching the game against Denmark closely when I get home next week from Switzerland. Roy Hodgson will experiment but he will also want to get a clear picture of who will start in Manaus against Italy when the World Cup campaign begins.
