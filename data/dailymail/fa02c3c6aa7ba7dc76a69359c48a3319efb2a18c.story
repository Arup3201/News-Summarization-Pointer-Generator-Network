Ben Fogle, pictured, 'instinctively' instinctively¿ hit a mugger in the face when he realised he was trying to steal his bag

As a TV presenter of survival programmes he is used to fending for himself in extreme conditions.

Ben Fogle found himself having to deploy his skills in the more urban setting of a London street after a man attempted to snatch his bag.

Thankfully it was Fogle who was left unharmed but his attacker was visibly injured after the presenter ‘instinctively’ hit him in the face when he realised what was happening.

And taking to social networking site Twitter minutes later, Fogle admitted punching the man in the face, telling his followers: ‘Dear Mr Mugger. You picked on the wrong man. Enjoy the black eye. Love Ben.’

The drama unfolded yesterday afternoon (Wed), as Fogle walked along a central London street, not far from where he lives with his wife Marina, and their children Ludo, 4, and Iona, 2.

He was on his way to a meeting with his PA near Oxford Street, where pickpockets are known to be rife.

No doubt the attacker hoped to catch his victim off guard, and attempted to seize the bag Fogle was carrying in his left hand.

But Fogle, who is used to fending for himself, albeit usually in less urban situations, when presenting programmes such as Extreme Lives, reacted ‘instinctively’, according to his spokesperson, and took a swing at the man as soon as he reached for the bag catching him in the face.

Last night Fogle’s spokesperson confirmed he had been unharmed during the incident, nor had anything been stolen, and he had not reported it to police.

Ben Fogle told his 105,000 followers about his ordeal on Twitter, telling them his mugger had 'picked on the wrong man'

Taking the strain: Ben Fogle, pictured on a rowing challenge, is more accustomed to using his survival skills in extreme conditions than on the streets of London

It is not the first time Fogle has narrowly avoided serious injury.

Last year he revealed how his drink had been spiked with ‘acid’ during a visit to a pub with some friends.

He suffered a ‘full on psychotic episode’ in which he tried to jump out of a window and through a glass table.

And he was kept in hospital for three days while tests were carried out.

Speaking of the experience, Fogle said: ‘It was like having an out of body experience. They had to lock the doors and restrain me from hurting myself.’

At the time the former Castaway contestant appealed to the person responsible to come forward, having had to postpone a five-week trip to the Middle East with the BBC.

Taking to Twitter later on, he thanked his followers for their concern and said he had only suffered bruised knuckles in the incident

On this occasion, however, he was simply using social media in order to share the experience with his followers.

The spokesperson said: ‘I doubt if the attacker will even look at Twitter. Ben just likes to Tweet a lot about what he’s doing and that’s what had just happened.’

Last night Fogle said: ‘I wasn’t prepared to let someone try and take my bag so I fought back. Maybe it was the right thing to do, maybe it wasn’t. But that’s what I did and I think it was perfectly acceptable given the situation.’

He added: ‘There was nothing in the bag anyway, it was actually just my old gym kit.’
