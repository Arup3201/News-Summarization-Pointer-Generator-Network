There are fender benders, sideswipes and rear-end accidents, but police in Canada are investigating their first-ever case of a car falling from the sky.

Two people were been injured after an experimental flying car crashed into a tree.

The aircraft clipped a fence  on Friday morning near a school in Vernon, British Columbia.

An experimental flying crashed down close to a school on Friday morning. The aircraft lost control hurting the pilot and his passenger.

Flying high: Taking to the skies is clearly a family passion for the Siebring family

Understatement: 'It seemed there was an anomaly on our approach to landing,' said Ray Siebring who was piloting the flaying-car

Aftermath: The car smashed into trees as it was coming into land

Injured: Incredibly both the pilot and passengers escaped with just minor injuries

Cause: Ray Siebring who was piloting the car-plane has described the incident as just a 'small anomaly' on landing

The flying car is a combination of a plane engine, propeller and parasail attached to a dune buggy.

Police spokesperson Gord Molendyk said there are indications the aircraft was coming into land.

'It looked like it was on its approach,' Molendyk said. 'There was motor sound and people looked up and it got into trouble and came through the fence and into the trees here.'

The pilot Ray Siebring and his passenger had to be pulled from the tree. They suffered minor injuries and were taken to hospital.

No one was hurt on the ground, although children from the school were preparing on the nearby grounds for a track and field day.

'It seemed there was an anomaly on our approach to landing," Ray Siebring told The Canadian Press from the crash site.

'It was just a sharp left turn that turned into a spiral, so the spiral took at least three rotations.'

As the Maverick — which looks like a dune buggy with a large propeller on its rear — started losing altitude, Siebring realized there was a semi-populated area that included a school directly in his path.

The situation called for quick thinking.

'I experienced one of those ... moments where time slows down,' he said. 'The training kicked in so that we were able to operate the aircraft and move it to a safe area.

Dangerous: The aircraft crashed into a tree as it was on final approach

'We were able to stop the rotation, but our altitude was critically low. I gave full power to dampen the forced landing and directed the aircraft ... away from the school and into some woods.'

No one was hurt on the ground although children from the school were preparing take to the nearby grounds for a track and field day.

Dale Olsen, a teacher at the nearby Fulton Secondary School, and said it was the talk of the morning.

'A lot of the kids saw it around school this morning,' he said. 'They said it looked like it stalled, the parachute started crumpling up and they couldn't get it going again.'

The Maverick which costs at least $94,000 can travel at speeds up to 100 mph and up to 40 mph in the air.

The car uses a 100-metre runway to take off and flies under a parasail, but it also needs a 100-metre runway to make a safe landing.
