Michelle
Heaton has whipped herself back into shape following the birth of son Aaron - 
her second child with businessman husband Hugh Hanley - in February, and now the popstar is hoping to share her tips with other women.

Michelle, 34, who is a FETAC-qualified personal trainer with 
qualifications in pre and post pregnancy exercise, has released a three-part exercise plan tailored to the three trimesters of pregnancy.

Describing itself as 'the only exercise DVD to feature a celebrity qualified to instruct rather than to merely stand looking thin beside a professional instructor', Michelle's offering features three programmes tailored to each of the three stages of pregnancy.

Slimming down: Michelle Heaton, 34, has shifted the pounds since giving birth to her second child in February and now she's releasing a DVD to help women do the same

Speaking to MailOnline about the £12.99 DVD, which launches tomorrow, she said: 'I know how hard it is to try and stay active during pregnancy so I wanted to share what I learnt and what helped me with others.

'After 
my first baby Faith was born, I realised that if I stayed active 
throughout pregnancy, to try and regain my figure afterwards would be 
less of a challenge. So that's what I set out to do when I got pregnant 
with AJ.

'I went looking for a pregnancy exercise DVD but I 
couldn't find one that took into account the massive changes our bodies 
undergo as the pregnancy develops. A trimester 3 lady should not be 
doing a trimester 1 workout! So I thought right, I'll do it myself.

'Everyone
 told me the DVD market is saturated or non-existent, but I've trained 
and qualified as a fitness instructor, I've paid my dues and I've got a 
system that works for me. So if one hundred or one thousand women want 
to borrow from it, I'll be delighted.'

The new DVD follows Michelle's journey as she aims to maintain a vibrant, fun and rewarding workout plan.

While she hasn't yet shared the kind of exercise she will be revealing, Michelle says that she combines her take on active pregnancy with first-hand experience as a mother, offering support, guidance and advice to women wishing to remain fit and healthy throughout their developing pregnancy and beyond.

Michelle refuses to speak about how much weight she has lost and instead wishes to focus on the 'wellbeing' aspect of her DVD and weightloss journey.

As well as her exercise regime, the
 Liberty X star opted for the Soulmatefood Post Natal Plan - a four-week
 diet that promotes healthy eating by providing new mother’s with the 
correct balance of nutrients in specially prepared meals delivered to 
their door.

Users
 can choose from three menu options - Weightloss, Low Carb and Balance -
 with dishes ranging from Cajun chicken, steamed sea bass, breakfast 
sundae and haddock frittata. 

Referring 
to the diet in an interview with OK! magazine, she said: ‘They work with
 what I like and what my end goal is and I get a delivery twice a week.

‘It’s a godsend at the moment because I can’t stand and cook family meals. It’s not a fad diet, it’s sport nutrition.’

Michelle, who found fame as a member of pop band Liberty X, says that 2008 heralded a fresh start for her when she met future husband, Irish fitness trainer Hugh Hanley.

With Hugh's inspiration and guidance Michelle found a new passion for health and fitness, revolutionised her lifestyle and shed three stone in weight.

How she got there: Michelle combines her take on active pregnancy with first hand experience as a mother and teaches others how to do the same in the DVD

Building on her interest and participation in fitness and health, 2010 saw Michelle become a FETAC-qualified personal trainer, and run both the New York and London Marathons.

When pregnant in 2011, Michelle further qualified as a Pre and Post Natal fitness instructor, with Michelle and Hugh's first child Faith being born in January 2012.

In July 2012, Michelle discovered she has the BRCA2 gene mutation, giving her an 80 per cent chance of developing breast cancer.

She underwent a double mastectomy as a preventative measure in November, 2012, with her story being documented for Lorraine (ITV1) and a weekly diary for Closer magazine, during Breast Cancer Awareness month.

Michelle and Hugh (now Head of Personal Training for Virgin Active gyms in the U.K.), already regularly share expert fitness advice with their 15,000+ followers on their Fitness & Nutrition Facebook page.

In the summer 2013, Michelle designed a fitness program for viewers of ITV's Lorraine called 'The Miami Beach Diet'.

Michelle will be launching her DVD at The Baby Show, returning to the NEC Birmingham from the 16th to 18th of May 2014.
