Australia’s largest Arabic newspaper has revealed it came under hacker attack by purported jihadists and received several text message threats from Islamic State extremists.

The El-Telegraph newspaper’s homepage was hacked last September, just days prior to the largest counter-terrorism raids the country has ever seen. Its landing page was replaced by a black Islamic State flag, prayer music played in the background and the message 'hacked by IS' was printed at the top of the screen. 

Staff received threats as late as December, just prior to the Sydney siege. In the wake of the Paris massacre, police last week urged newspaper staff to report any out of the ordinary threats and phone calls.

This is the El Telegraph newspaper as it appears normally. Staff received threats after publishing reports (pictured) about the Islamic State

Editor-in-chief Antoine Kazzi told Daily Mail Australia he received the threats after publishing reports about the Islamic State terror group. 

‘The police told me they want me to tell them everything no matter how small - they want it on their radar,’ Mr Kazzi said.

‘We have received threats in the past, just for reporting news about Islamic State, so I am happy the police are taking everything seriously.  

During the early hours of September 16 the site’s manager, who did not want to be named, detected what appeared to be a cyber-hacking by Islamic State sympathisers. 

Mr Kazzi said he was placed under police protection following an apparent text message threat the same week.

‘I received a text message right after we covered a story on Islamic State and for about three months police officers were watching my home and workplace and they continue to check in every now and then,’ he said.

Later, in December, he received a message which said: 'I know where you live, I know where you are, don’t put anything about Islam (in the paper)'.

The newspaper's website manager, who did not wish to be named for security reasons, told Daily Mail Australia he was alarmed to wake up to the hacking.  

‘I woke up at around 2am to an email alert from our webhost informing me of the hacking,’ said the website manager .

‘I turned on my computer to find two alarming images as Islamic prayer music played. 

'I saw the black Islamic State flag with Arabic calligraphy emerging on the screen and the flag of Iraq on top of it. 

‘We were left scrambling for ways to regain access to our own site. Even our webhost could not assist. It was a sophisticated hack but thankfully short-lived,’ he said.

El-Telegraph Arabic newspaper is the country's largest Arabic newspaper and although staff believe it is their duty to continue to report on news relating to Islamic State they still fear for their safety.

Sub-editor and news reporter Pierre Seeman said said the publication will continue to take a stance against terrorism and report on all Middle Eastern issues to protect the ideal of the freedom of the press.

‘We are a publication that covers a wide range of issues. We have to report on all issues because we owe that to our readers. 

'We are against terrorism and we will continue to report the facts and promote peace in our coverage of both local and international issues.’

The police have been notified about these incidents and the publication has since tightened its security measures.

A New South Wales Police Force spokesman said the agency ‘takes all reports of threats seriously and investigates all incidents thoroughly.’
