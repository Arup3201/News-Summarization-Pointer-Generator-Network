You might know her as the glossy haired ‘It’ girl with a bona fide aristocratic background, a woman regularly linked with the rich and eligible including, for a time, Prince Andrew and footballer Ryan Giggs.

Or perhaps you have seen her as the glamorous socialite-turned-entrepreneur on the gloriously lightweight Ladies of London, a reality TV show that revels in the tribulations and jealousies of the capital’s ‘elite’ lunchers.

But Caroline Stanbury has another, altogether different claim to fame, one which is guaranteed to set jaws dropping to the parquet – even in the super-rich Surrey commuter belt where she has her £8million home.

For at the heart of her mini-mansion is a very special room, virtually a shrine. And it is dedicated to a quite outrageous collection of handbags so expensive that just one of them would keep the average household running for several months.

‘All my friends think my collection of designer handbags is ridiculous,’ Caroline admits. ‘Cem, my husband, thinks I’m crazy to have so many.’

He has little chance of avoiding them. Taking pride of place in their imposing hallway stands a sculpture that pays homage to her near obsession: a cast-iron statue in the shape of that most desirable of female possessions, a Hermes Birkin bag, a monument to a thoroughly modern collection.

Housed in a custom-made walk-in wardrobe with full-length mirrors, velvet-lined window seats, Venetian glass dressers and cashmere-soft cream carpets, are at least 25 bags by Hermes and Chanel.

Caroline is understandably shy of pricing the collection, but it is not unreasonable to guess they are worth a cool £200,000; the basic cost of a Birkin is £5,000.

She even has two Hermes Kelly 28cm bags, which could cost anything up to £25,000. 

But the price of this and other luxury bags can rapidly reach the stratosphere depending on size, on the materials used and if there are any customised alterations.

The bags visible here are not the whole of her collection – even at a conservative estimate they are worth nearly £85,000. Every item is organised by colour and designer, including regular and clutch-sized Birken and Kelly bags in pink, burnt orange, tan and jade green.

‘I’ve arranged my collection very carefully and I prefer no one touches them, but I am not overly precious,’ she says. ‘My bags get well-used, but not always well-treated.’

Sixteen more shelves groan with literally hundreds of shoes by Tom Ford, Gianvito Rossi (‘the most comfortable shoes you will ever wear’), Chanel, Givenchy and Valentino (so chic, apparently.)

There are stilettos, sling backs and pumps in every colour and style imaginable – an array worth £100,000 – all glittering beneath spotlights.

‘I must have 200 pairs of shoes, which I don’t think is that many,’ she says. ‘I don’t buy from the High Street, because I want things to last.’

But her true weakness, the former stylist and party girl admits, is those handbags. It has been a long association: she was given her first Birken when I was 21.

‘Look,’ she says, ‘I’ve worked hard all my life to fund this lifestyle. I used to buy the “It” bags and I would live on baked beans for weeks to afford them. But I got fed up because everyone had the same thing. Now I buy classic bags. I am a very good customer at Hermes and they know me personally.

‘For all that my husband moans, he actually feeds my habit. We have just got back from Venice and he bought me the new Chanel Boy bag in cream.’ She picks it up and hugs it to her chest.

‘If you don’t have money to spend on clothes, a beautiful handbag makes the rest of your outfit look expensive. I especially love going to Paris because when you are in a nice restaurant you are always given an extra chair for the Birken which makes me laugh.’

The Birkin is her outright favourite, so much so that she owns 15 of them. ‘Although actually I might just be over my Birken addiction,’ she says. ‘Now it’s all about the Constance, which is smaller, lighter and can be worn over the shoulder.’

Estimated to be worth £20million in her own right, Caroline is at pains to say she is also a grafter. Today she runs two successful businesses, Giftlibrary.com, an online gift service, and The Wedding Shop of Caroline Stanbury, a one-stop wedding shop. ‘I actually live a stressful life,’ she insists. ‘I know it may not seem that way from the show but running two businesses is tough.’

Her entrance into ‘society’ however was pretty much pain-free. As a 17-year-old at the Berkeley Dress Show, then the curtain raiser to the London season, she went down the catwalk with her mother Elizabeth, a descendant of the Vestey dynasty. Since then, she has led a charmed and well-connected existence.

Caroline is still remembered for what was widely assumed to be a relationship with Prince Andrew – but she wants to put the record straight, saying they were nothing more than friends.

‘The truth is we have known each other for many years – he knows my parents and used to read stories to my brother and sister, but we have only ever been friends Nothing went on between us so it was awkward when we were wrong-ly linked in the press.’

There was another notable liaison, too. ‘I met Ryan Giggs at the Monte Carlo sports awards when I was 24,’ she explains. ‘He was a big star at the time with Manchester United. But he wasn’t a huge party boy, he was quite shy.

‘It was a strange relationship because he was always travelling so we spent most of it on the phone. He certainly wasn’t the love of my life.’

She ended the relationship when she read in a newspaper that Giggs had cheated on her. ‘Frankly, he did me a favour,’ she says. ‘If I had stayed with Ryan there is no way I would be where I am now.’

She is now married to the Turkish financier Cem Habib, with whom she has three children; daughter Yasmine, eight, and four-year-old twin sons, Zack and Aaron.

The couple met in 2003 and have been married for ten years.

Perhaps it should be expected that Caroline, now 38, was top of TV producers’ wish list for Ladies of London, which follows the lives of two wealthy British women and five fame-hungry Americans. ‘They wanted an aristocrat on the show as a contrast to the Americans,’ she says.

‘And it was interesting for them to see someone from my background who actually works for a living.

‘Episode one was the most difficult. I cringed when I watched it on television.’

She may not have been the only one. ‘Mum was terrified about me doing Ladies of London but I thought that reality television is a quick way to get recognition.

‘I have always wanted to be successful. If Cem was the richest man on the planet I would still work. I know that anything can happen. My dad (capitalist Anthony Stanbury) made and lost money. I’ll always work to afford our lifestyle.

‘But when I started I knew little about business. I still have a copy of Business School for Dummies on my desk. People think things came easy for me, that I was handed everything on a plate. I haven’t been. I’ve been to Hell and back with Giftlibrary.com. I’ve weathered a double dip recession.’

Her success on the television show seems to have genuinely surprised Stanbury. ‘I really didn’t expect it. At school I was never the most popular girl. I was really ugly and used to get picked on.’

Although with a collection of bags like that, she won’t get much sympathy now...

Solved: Prince Andrew and the mystery blonde (right), who turned out to be TV presenter Annabelle Bond

Caroline has often been linked with Prince Andrew, but she insists it is a case of mistaken identity.

In 2000 he was photographed at a St Tropez beach with a blonde and a media frenzy ensued, identifying her as the mystery woman.

‘Though I was named as the girl in the picture, it wasn’t me,’ Caroline laughs. ‘It was Annabelle Bond [the TV presenter and explorer].

‘But even my mother thought that it was me at first!’

Annabelle Bond, the TV presenter, was later revealed to be the mystery woman with Prince Andrew
