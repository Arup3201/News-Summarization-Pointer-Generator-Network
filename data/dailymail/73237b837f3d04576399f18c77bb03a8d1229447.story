Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

Unsurprisingly, World Cup fever dominates the front pages of Tuesday's papers.

In France, L'Equipe lead with a picture of Neymar celebrating scoring for Brazil in their 4-1 win over Cameroon on Monday evening with the headline 'The Lone Star'.

The main man: French paper L'Equipe and Spain's Mundo Deportivo hail Brazil striker Neymar

Neymar's brace secured top spot in Group A for Brazil and sets up a last-16 showdown with South American rivals Chile. Neymar is also now the World Cup's leading scorer with four goals.

In Spain, Mundo Deportivo also pay tribute to Neymar, saying the striker shone and inspired Brazil to glory.

Spain ended their terrible World Cup campaign with a 3-0 win over Australia and that also makes Mundo's front page with a big goodbye headline. The paper say 'Iniesta leads the goal fest as La Roja say goodbye to Brazil and Villa scores a backheel as his last strike'.

The other big story in Spain is Liverpool striker Luis Suarez's apparent move to Barcelona. Mundo say the clubs are negotiating 'complicated deal' that also involves Alexis Sanchez. They claim that at Anfield it is known that Suarez wants to move to the Nou Camp.

Elsewhere in Spain, AS boldly declare 'We
 will return' as Spain bow out of the World Cup with a 'respectable' win
 over Australia. They also say that, according to Bein Sports, Monaco's 
Radamel Falcao has agreed to join Real Madrid and that Manchester United
 are close to signing Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao.

D-day: Papers in Italy focus on the Azzurri's Group D deciding clash with Uruguay

Marca also take a positive spin on Spain, declaring this 'a fresh start' for Vicente Del Bosque's side. Del Bosque, however, may not be there with the paper saying he will consider his future soon. Their pain picture is of Del Bosque hugging Iniesta, who claims 'it was a hug of respect'.

Another intriguing story is the news that Zinedine Zidane could be set to start in management with Real president Florentino Perez ready to give him a chance with Castilla - Madrid's reserve team - in the Spanish second division.

In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport picture Mario Balotteli and Ciro Immobile and declare that Cesare Prandelli will play the pair upfront together against Uruguay on Tuesday. Italy need a point to qualify from Group D, and Prandelli says his side 'needs character, head and competitiveness' to do so.

Tuttosport, meanwhile, declare 'no messing around' and ask whether Immobile will be Italy's saviour?
