A widow has spoken for the first time about the horrific death of her husband who was eaten by his friends after the party got lost at sea in bitter temperatures for nearly two months.

Olga Kurochkin, 37, said her life had been ruined by the terrible fate of Andrei whose remains were found in the pitiless eastern reaches of Siberia.

Two members of the four-strong party survived the ordeal and, after carrying the head of 44-year-old Mr Kurochkin through the wild, told police they had eaten the man from Saratov after he froze to death.

Forensic analysis of Mr Kurochkin's body parts revealed that sections of flesh had been carefully sliced away while joints had been butchered. 

Andrei's heartbroken wife Olga (pictured on their wedding day) said: 'I never expected such horror could come into my life' after she learned what had happened to her spouse

Speaking to The Siberian Times Mrs Kurochkin said: 'I never expected such horror could come into my life. It has ruined 
not just my life, but also the lives of all our relatives, and we are a 
big family.

'Can you imagine what I have left? One foot with toes, one finger, and the back of his skull with some hair.

'This is it. This is all I have left 
from the man I loved. Having just these remains, how can I say goodbye 
to him? I have got almost nothing to cry over.

'I can't think about it, I am losing my mind with this.'

Mrs Kurochki, who has a daughter Alyona, 21, is suing survivors Alexander Abdullaev, 37, and Alexei 
Gorulenko, 35, for emotional distress. She also wants a criminal prosecution brought against them.

'I don't want to suspect them of murder, this would be just 
too much,' she added. 'But I do want them to be punished for what they did, because it is just outrageous to leave it like this.

'Now I want these cannibals to be punished. I fear our police is not keen to investigate this case properly.

'Our law does not say a word about 
cannibalism, it is not a crime, so our two survivors can be punished 
only for defiling a body and perhaps leaving a human being in danger.  

'The
 (police) report did not leave me any hope, now I can be sure my husband
 Andrei is dead and his body was found there in the taiga.

'I am sure they have eaten him. 
Now we know that Andrei died somewhere else and they dragged the body 
all the way through the snow, eating it step by step.

'But together with the remains of my husband there were also found the bones of animals.

'If they could kill animals, why would they need to try eating a human body? And why did they carry his head with them?'

Mr Kurochkin set out with his friends from Dipkun village, Amur region, on an epic fishing trip-of-a-lifetime to eastern Siberia on August 8 last year.

Catastrophe struck early in to their 
trip when their jeep sunk in a frozen river leaving the party stranded 
in one of the most isolated spots in the world.

All
 four took refuge in a remote hunting lodge, which they used as a base 
for a number of weeks, until they exhausted its food supplies.

They
 did not seem in any rush to escape from the taiga, despite losing their
 fishing tackle and the vehicle, in which they had often slept.

During
 this period they encountered a number of hunters who had vehicles and 
walkie-talkies. At least one let them use his satellite phone.

As conditions worsened they began walking back to civilisation at the beginning of October.

They left a note in a hunter's house saying they had sheltered under the owner's roof and eaten all his food.

They also left 3,000 roubles – around £60. Their progress back to civilisation was haphazard.

Had
 they been fit and properly equipped, they could have covered the 
distance in a matter of days, even with the snow and sub-zero 
temperatures.

But it took almost seven weeks before two of them were found some nine miles from Dipkun.

In
 this time it is known all four took refuge in another empty hunter’s 
shack near the Daurka River, an area described by locals as lonely and 
macabre. In recent years, seven dead bodies have been found there.

They were found in the Sakha Republic by a Russian Emergencies Ministry rescue helicopter which saved their lives.

Abdullaev eventually confessed to the authorities that they had eaten Mr Kurochkin.

'He died by himself. He froze to 
death. Only after that did we start eating him,' Abdullaev told 
Neryungri police in the Sakha Republic. 

'At one point they were surviving on moss and sawdust. A lie detector test proves they were desperate,' said one official.

While he is now assisting investigators, Gorulenko escaped first
 to Chita, then Moscow, and then vanished altogether ten days ago, say 
reports.

The other fisherman in the group Viktor Komarov, 47, has still not been found.
