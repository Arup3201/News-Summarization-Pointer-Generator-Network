A 20-year-old woman killed while sharing a snowmobile driven by her allegedly intoxicated friend thought she had chosen the safer driver.

Victoria Henderson died on Wednesday night after flying off the back of a snowmobile operated by Nicholas Krenz and hitting an ice shack on frozen Bone Lake, Wisconsin.

Krenz, 21, allegedly veered to avoid the shack, throwing the young woman off.

Tragic: Victoria Henderson, 20, died on Wednesday night after being thrown off the back of a snowmobile and hitting an ice shack. She died from her head injuries

Henderson's boyfriend Thomas Mergens was trailing the pair on a separate snowmobile when the accident happened about 10pm.

Ironically, Henderson, from the western Wisconsin town of Luck, had refused to ride with her boyfriend because she felt he drove too fast.

The two men tried desperately to revive the woman, who was wearing a helment, but she died at the scene. She suffered serious head injuries.

Sheriff Peter Johnson said that Henderson 'typically rode with Krenz because her boyfriend [Mergens] drove too fast'

Scene: Krenz had allegedly veered to avoid this ice shack on Bone Lake, Wisconsin, when the accident happened

Arrested: Nicholas Krenz, 21, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of drunk driving

'It looks like [Krenz] took a left and tossed her to the right (in a) last-second (maneuver),' he added.

Krenz was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.

The Twin Cities man was not hurt and remains free pending charges.

Henderson had moved from Little Rock, Arkansas and worked at the Thirsty Otter Tavern and Resort for about a year.

The tavern has organized a fundraiser for the popular server's family.

'Tori was an Employee, Friend and part of our Otter Family,' read a notice on the tavernâ€™s Facebook page.

'With very heavy hearts we invite you to come and help us celebrate her life and the wonderful person that she was. Tori was loved by everyone and will be missed terribly!!!!!â€
