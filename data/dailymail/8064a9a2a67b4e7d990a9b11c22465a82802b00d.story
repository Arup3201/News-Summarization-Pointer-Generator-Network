Shocking footage shows three train surfers hitching a ride on Russia's fastest train from Moscow to St Petersburg.

The daredevil ride on the Sapsan sparked warnings in Moscow that as many as 600 people died last year from illegal surfing on the railways while 424 were detained by police.

The three men shown here fled the train scrambling across grass near the track, being clambering over fencing and running into woodland after the train made an emergency stop once the driver became away of the stowaways.

Shocking footage shows three train surfers hitching a ride on Russia's fastest train from Moscow to St Petersburg

The daredevil ride on the Sapsan sparked warnings in Moscow that as many as 600 people died last year from illegal surfing on the railways while 424 were detained by police

The footage of the prank includes the voice of a furious driver berating the men for their 'Idiot Express' ride at 135 mph close to Tver station on the main high speed line between Russian's two largest cities.

It is believed drivers on other trains alerted signalmen to the death-defying young men, and the train, nicknamed the 'Russian Bullet', was ordered to halt.

After fleeing the train, one of the surfers shouts back to the irate railwayman:  "It's OK, you go. It was only three of us. We won't do it again. It was only three of us, you can go."

The potential fine for such behaviour is a mere 100 roubles -  less than £2

The incident led to a report by the Kremlin's own newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta report on how the three surfers forced the Sapsan to make an emergency stop

Filmed on 18 May, it follows the three onto the train after the hid in sidings, waiting for the train to stop, jumping on between the carriages and starting the ride, then climbing on to the roof when when the train slowed down.

The incident led to a report by the Kremlin's own newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta report on how the three surfers forced the Sapsan to make an emergency stop.

The paper pointed out that the potential fine for such behaviour is a mere 100 roubles, less than £2 and unlikely to be sufficient to stop the dangerous craze, and it highlighted the shocking death toll.

The cost of a ticket between Moscow and St Petersburg on the train would be 36 times as much.

Maximum speed of the Sapsan train is 150 mph.
