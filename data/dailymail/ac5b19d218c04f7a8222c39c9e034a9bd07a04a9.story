A football coach is set to be separated from his Filipino bride for the birth of their first child after she was banned from the UK due to strict visa rules.

Ian Wootton, who lives in Bromley, south east London, and his heavily pregnant wife Sunshine are expecting their first son at the end of March.

But Mr Wootton, 46, has been unable to get his wife a spousal visa because he does not earn the £22,400 minimum which he needs to support her and her 18-month-old son Russell.

Before Sunshine, 26, can move to the UK, Mr Wootton also needs to prove he has at least £72,000 in his savings - a factor which is complicated because he is self-employed.

He told MailOnline: 'David Cameron is always shouting about family values but these ridiculous rules are tearing families apart. They are not giving us a fair chance to be together

'This is the only chance I have to be there for the birth of my child, but it has been made so difficult.

'We don't want her to come over here and claim benefits, or take anything off the government. We just want to be together. But because I have married someone that is outside the EU, I can't.'

Mr Wootton met his wife in 2013, when he visited the Philippines for a friend's wedding.

His wife then came to the UK for six months on a visitor's visa before they married in the Philippines in October.

Mr Wootton returned to the UK in January, hoping Sunshine would soon be able to follow.

But his wife - who is seven months' pregnant - has been unable to join him because his income does not fulfill the strict specifications.

The football coach, who has three employees working for his business, is now urgently trying to convert the attic in his £350,000 home, so he can put it on the market and declare the profit as savings.

The 46-year-old has been unable to get a spousal visa for his wife because he falls short of the £22,400 minimum earning requirement to support his family, which includes her 18-month-old son Russell.

He said: 'I need to do this as soon as possible so I can sell the house and have the money, just so my wife can come over and be with me. But if this backfires, I don't know what I will do - it is every penny I have got.'

The Minimum Income Requirement policy, introduced in 2012, stipulates that only British citizens, or those with refugee status, who earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa.

This rises to £22,400 for families with a child, and a further £2,400 for each extra child. 

Applicants can rely on cash savings to make up the total amount if they are more than £16,000 and held for at least six months under their control. 

But while cash savings can be combined with income from salaried employment, they cannot be combined with income from self-employment.

The Home Office policy also states that income sources from a third party, including state benefits, are not permitted.

It means the applicant cannot use any form of welfare benefits, disability allowance, income support, housing benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance or other towards the minimum income requirement.

The police states that £62,500 in cash savings is required if no other income sources are being used to meet the income requirement.

It would mean someone earning less than the required minimum salary who is self-employed would need to have £62,000, as well as the required difference between their salary and the threshold. 

Overseas employment income, or prospective earnings from a job offer in the UK, will also not be taken into account.

Therefore, only the sponsor's employment income is considered if the applicant is not already living and working in the UK. 

An all-party parliamentary group said the restrictions were 'causing anguish' with children suffering as a result. 

The Home Office said the rules are in place so that those coming to the UK for family migration 'do not become a burden on the rest of the public'.

But Mr Wootton said he owns his own company, has £20,000 in savings and even owns his own home, meaning they would have no need to rely on the state.  

He said: 'I never ask for help financially; I always pay my bills. Yes, I am on a low income, but I do not have credit card debts and I work in a job which brings benefit to the community. 

'Yet, you could have someone who is earning more than me who is not financially stable, who would not be subject to these same rules.

'What's crazy is that, if I had sat there and taken benefits, I would have been exempt from these rules and my wife could have been here in the UK with me.'

He added: 'I mean, what ordinary person just has £72,000 in their savings? It's impossible.' 

Mr Wootton says he cannot move to the Philippines due to a serious bowel condition, Hirschsprung's disease, which means he often needs treatment.

He is also loath to leave behind the company which he set up, which visits different schools in London, coaching children and their parents in sport. Some of his projects are supported by Bromley Council.

He said: 'I have gone through every emotion there is - I can't sleep.

'Obviously I want to be there for my wife during labour but I can't just keep leaving the UK, when I have work commitments. And the flights to and from really add up. 

'I am trying desperately now to cobble together this £72,000. I have been back from the Philippines since January 1 and haven't even put my heating on yet - everything is costing so much money.'   

The Home Office said: 'Our requirements reflect advice from independent experts and ensure people coming here for family migration do not become a burden on the rest of the public.

'They are also helping to ensure that those who do come to live in the UK can play a full part in British life.'
