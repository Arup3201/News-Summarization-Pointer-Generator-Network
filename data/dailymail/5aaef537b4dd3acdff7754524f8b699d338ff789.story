Ahead of Brazil's crucial World Cup 
semi-final against Germany in Belo Horizonte, Sportsmail 
takes a closer look at Luiz Felipe Scolari's side.

Player of the tournament: Neymar (5 games, 4 goals)

The poster boy of this World Cup has almost single-handedly united a nation fractured by social division and sent belief coursing through the veins of the country.

The Robin to Lionel Messi’s Batman at Barcelona, Neymar has been liberated by responsibility, committing opponents, scoring goals and elevating Brazil out of the rut of mediocrity that has enveloped his fellow attackers Hulk and Fred.

Perfect start: Brazil star Neymar opened his World Cup account with two goals against Croatia in Sao Paulo

Tournament highlight: David Luiz's stunning strike against Colombia

David Luiz’s swirling, dipping free-kick will forever be remembered, as he responded to the adrenalin shots pumped from the terraces with a goal of extraordinary individual quality.

The guttural release, hair bouncing, veins bulging and eyes boggling as he charged towards the Brazilian support, kung-fu kicking the corner flag, was the moment of this World Cup.

Technique: David Luiz watches his powerful free-kick fly towards David Ospina's goal to put Brazil 2-0 ahead

Lowlight: Underhand tactics against Colombia

Perhaps our vision of the Brazilian sides of years gone by is a touch romantic, but it has been a shame to see talented, dynamic talent like Manchester City's Fernandinho reduced to slicing the legs off talents such as Colombia’s James Rodriguez.

Brazil’s competitive courage and determination has been compelling to watch but the impressions of World Cup villains like Marc van Bommel and Claudio Gentile have been dispiriting, to say the least.

Savage: Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho was guilty of regularly fouling Colombia's James Rodriguez

Best goal: David Luiz v Colombia, 2-1, Quarter-final, Castelao Stadium

How has the boss performed?

Luiz Felipe 
Scolari has declared that Brazil are two steps from heaven and he will 
be elevated to God-like status if he can guide his country to a second 
World Cup triumph, after previously managing them to glory in 2002.

His 
dark pragmatism has not been well-received by all observers but in 
Brazil, the natives are riding a tidal wave of emotion and unity as 
Scolari’s cool exterior betrays the frenzied but effective performances 
of his players.

Repeat performance? Luiz Felipe Scolari is on the verge of leading Brazil to a second World up triumph

Top scorer: Neymar – 4 goals

Killer stat: Brazil are unbeaten in competitive football (not including friendlies) for 39 years on home soil. The run stretches back to a defeat by Peru in 1975 in the Copa America.

Results in 9pm kick-offs: Played three, won three, defeating Croatia, Cameroon and Colombia.

BBC v ITV: BBC: Brazil won all three games against Croatia, Cameroon and Colombia on ITV but they have proved less successful on the BBC, drawing 0-0 win Mexico and only defeating Chile in the first knockout round on penalty kicks.

Route to semi-finals: Comfortable progress through Group A with victories over Croatia and Cameroon and a draw against Mexico, before seeing off South American rivals Chile and Colombia in the final 16 and quarter-finals.

FIFA ranking: 3

Likely line-up: Cesar; Maicon, Dante, Luiz, Marcelo; Paulinho, Fernadinho; Hulk, Oscar, Willian; Fred

World Cup pedigree: Five time winners in Sweden in 1958, Chile in 1962, Mexico in 1970, USA in 1994 and South Korea in 2002. Finalists in the last World Cup in Brazil in 1950, where they were defeated by Uruguay. Semi-finalists in 1938, 1974, 1978.
