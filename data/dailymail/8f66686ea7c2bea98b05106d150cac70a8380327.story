A grandmother was punched in the face and dragged around by her hair - after she asked fellow restaurant goers to stop swearing during her grandson's birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.

The 50-year-old had been attending the child's seventh birthday at the party venue in Dearborn, Michigan when she was attacked yesterday afternoon.

The family, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal, took the woman to nearby Oakland hospital where she had a CAT scan and was treated for minor injuries to her face.

They told Fox 2 that when she asked people sitting nearby not to swear, 'They told her to ''shut the f*** up and turn around'''.

Witnesses then said that a man jumped over the table and began throwing punches and grabbed the woman by the head.

Chuck E.Cheese, where the motto is 'where a kid can be a kid', is a family restaurant where children can have pizza parties while playing on rides and in video game arcades.

The company has more than 500 locations in the U.S., Canada and parts of the Middle East and South America.
