Ties to be played on August 19/20 and 26/27 

Arsenal’s attention will be fixed on the Champions League play-off round draw at 11am on Friday, and Arsene Wenger’s side could face a difficult route into the group stage.

The Gunners are entering the competition through the ‘league route,’ as they are not champions of their national league. 

Although Arsenal will be seeded for the draw alongside Porto, Bayer Leverkusen, Napoli and Zenit, they still face the prospect of playing some of Europe’s more successful clubs. 

Here, we look at their possible opponents in more detail. 

Task: Arsenal will discover who they will face in the Champions League play-off round on Friday

Distance: 254 miles

They would be changed back as soon as the lost territories were recaptured, which never happened. Hence black and white remain the club’s colours today.

Difficulty Rating: 8  

Roar of delight: Demba Ba recently signed for the Turkish outfit, and has made a fine start to his career
