Denise Welch's toyboy fiancé Lincoln Townley was rushed to hospital after collapsing at home.

Paramedics thought the 39-year-old, of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, was having a heart attack after he complained of chest pains.

A spokeswoman for Denise told the MailOnline on Wednesday that Lincoln, who acts as the former Loose Woman's publicist, did not suffer a heart attack as was first thought, and doctors are continuing to run tests.

She added: 'Denise thanks everyone for their concern.'

The couple were last seen at the premiere of Run For Your Wife in London last week, with both looking healthy and happy.

Denise and Lincoln plan to get married this summer in the Algarve, with the actress' ex-husband Tim Healy already having been invited.

Lincoln proposed to former Coronation Street star Denise last August while the pair were on holiday in France.

In preparation for the wedding Denise had admitted that she was going to focus on shedding pounds, by getting more active in the bedroom.

She told the Sunday People: 'Burning calories in the boudoir is something I intend to keep doing. That’s a very important part of our relationship.'

Denise suffered heartache when she split from ex-husband Tim but has since recovered after settling down with Lincoln.

She said: '2012 was a year full of more highs and lows than I’ve ever had in my life. The high being my relationship with Lincoln and the lows everything else that happened.'
