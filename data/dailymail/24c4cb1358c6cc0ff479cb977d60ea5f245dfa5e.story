Employees of a fast food restaurant in Texas fled the service counter and locked themselves inside a freezer, convinced they were being held up, after a group of armed men walked in last Thursday.

But the band of gun-toting 'bandits' turned out to be members of Open Carry Texas, the pro-gun group, who were on their way to a peaceful demonstration.

The police were equally as convinced they were dealing with a robbery, with at least a dozen officers showing up at the Jack in the Box in Fort Worth.

'I would estimate around 10 squad cars showed up, some with two per squad car,' demonstrator Edwin Haros told NBC 5.

Full force: An estimated 10 squad cars arrived at the scene, believing it to be a full-scale robbery by a heavily-armed gang

'I believe we counted more than 15 officers showed up on scene.'

While the protestors - who advocate that gun owners should be able to openly carry firearms - expressed upset at the way police handled the situation.

However the authorities said anyone would have done the same.

'(The staff) locked themselves inside a freezer for protection out of fear the rifle-carrying men would rob them,' Sgt. Ray Bush, with the Fort Worth Police Department, said.

'The demonstration had no signage that would have alerted anyone to their real purpose, and to our knowledge they did not attempt to contact anyone in the Fort Worth Police Department to advise us prior to the demonstration.'

Open Carry Texas were 'pushing for the right to carry handguns in public' outside the restaurant.

Supporter: Open Carry Texas demonstrator Edwin Haros said he is entitled to carry a gun because 'police can't always be there'

Haros said they were 'not trying to alarm anybody'.

'We're doing this because it's our constitutional right.'

Open Carry Texas members returned to the Jack in the Box following the incident for another meal, taking a photo with the employees, who had since retreated from the freezer.

This isn't the first time Open Carry Texas has been involved in controversies surrounding guns and restaurants.

After Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz asked customers to not bring guns into the stores, the group carried rifles and shots guns into an Arlington, Texas Starbucks.
