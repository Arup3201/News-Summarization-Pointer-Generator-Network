A fugitive on the run from child abuse charges for 14 years has finally been captured thanks to facial recognition technology.

Neil Stammer was arrested in 1999 in New Mexico on multiple state charges including child sex abuse and kidnapping, but went on the run after being released on bond.

He was recently arrested in Nepal.

The FBI has been involved in the case since 2000 but as there were few leads the trail went cold, Fox News reports.

However FBI Special Agent Russ Wilson put a new wanted poster for the fugitive in January.

'In addition to the current 
fugitives, I had a stack of old cases, and Stammerâ€™s stood out,' he wrote in a statement at the FBI site.

Concurrently, a Diplomatic Security Service agent had begun testing facial recognition software to spot passport fraud, and used that software on Stammer's wanted poster to see if it would match any passport photos on file.

This led them to discover the fugitive was actually teaching English in Nepal, where he was known as Kevin Hodges.

The FBI is now building a huge database for the purposes of facial recognition which could store up to 52 million images by 2015

'He was very comfortable in Nepal,' Wilson wrote. 'My impression was that he never thought he would be 
discovered.'

Facial recognition software is proving to be a powerful tool for law enforcement.

An armed robber was captured 41 years after escaping a North Carolina prison thanks to the technology, which is becoming more widely used.

The FBI is now building a huge database for the purposes of facial recognition which could store up to 52 million images by 2015.

The NSA is also reportedly gathering electronic images for a similar program.

And in the private sector, both Ford and Intel as working on adding facial recognition software to car dashboards.
