Teenager Rose Farley, 15, from Liverpool, who died after claims her drink was spiked at a social club

Detectives
investigating the death of a teenager whose drink is feared to have 
been spiked with Ecstasy were quizzing a girl of 15 on suspicion of 
manslaughter today.

The youngster was arrested just 24 hours after Rose Farley, also 15, was laid to rest at an emotionally-charged funeral.

Rose,
whose parents are close friends of England football captain Steve 
Gerrard his wife Alex, died on June 2 hours after attending an 18th 
birthday party at a social club in Liverpool.

Police
are investigating claims her drink was spiked with a drug, or if she had
taken some form of illegal substance. The results of toxicology tests 
will be released in the coming weeks to establish exactly how Rose died.

Today
Merseyside Police confirmed the suspect, from the Kirkdale area of 
Liverpool, was being questioned on suspicion of unlawful killing and 
possession of a controlled substance with intent to supply.

Earlier
this month two males, a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old both from 
Everton, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and supplying 
controlled drugs. They were questioned by detectives and released 
on bail pending further inquiries.

The
tragedy occurred after Rose who attended North Liverpool Academy school
left an 18-year-old’s birthday party at The Silverstrian on June 1.

At 5am she was taken by ambulance from her home in West Derby to Alder Hey children’s Hospital where she died on June 2.

In
the days leading up to the 18th birthday party police had issued a 
warning about potentially lethal 'pink ecstasy' tablets known as Dr 
Death which were being circulated around Liverpool.

Police are investigating Rose Farley's death after claims her drink was spiked at a party on Friday

Although
police are investigating the claims that Rose’s drink may have been 
spiked they have stressed they are two separate inquiries.

On
Thursday this week at the youngster’s funeral at St Mary’s Church in 
West Derby, her parents Chris, 43, and Lyn, 38, issued a statement 
describing their daughter as a 'bubbly, beautiful, vivacious and popular
young woman'.

The statement added: 'The support for our family has been overwhelming and the love shown for Rose is so comforting.

'The
funeral gives us a chance to remember how she enriched so many lives. 
She was a bubbly, beautiful, vivacious and popular young woman.'

Thousands have viewed a tribute page on Facebook to the popular teenager with many leaving tributes following her tragic death

'We
are so grateful to everyone who has expressed sympathy, paid their 
respects or pledged money to the appeal set up in Rose’s memory and we 
would urge people to continue to make donations.

'In
particular we would like thank the staff at Alder Hey, especially those
from the bereavement unit whose support and expertise has been 
outstanding.'

Within nine days an online 
fundraising bid on the website Just Giving has received widespread 
support and raised more than £4,000.

Former
Eastenders actress Samantha Womack and her husband Mark donated £100 
along with further gifts from DJ Lee Butler and members of Liverpool FC 
fan Michael Shields’ family.

The Farley’s family solicitor David Kirwan said: 'Family members are still understandably distressed and grief-stricken.

'How
would anyone feel if as parents they had lost their 15-year-old child? 
'It’s something you never dream of happening. You bring children into 
the world and you presume they will outlive you.

'It’s
bad enough to lose a child at any age, but when they’re a teenager and 
they’ve not had time to blossom, it’s awful. For Chris and Lynn it’s a 
huge open wound. They are going through a very bad time.'

An inquest into Rose’s death has been opened and adjourned.

Rose Farley's death came shortly after police in Merseyside issued warnings about the sale of ecstasy on the streets in the area
