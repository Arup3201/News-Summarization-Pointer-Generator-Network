The NHS faces a ‘financial crisis’ after next year’s general election, a leading think-tank has warned.

The King’s Fund said a budget freeze implemented as a result of the recession risked putting the majority of hospitals into deficit.

It warned that whoever won next May’s election will need to find more funding for the NHS or face having to make ‘significant cuts to services’.

The health policy think-tank reported that two-thirds of NHS finance directors feared their hospital would go into deficit between 2015 and 2016, with another one in five uncertain about the future. 

'At risk': The majority of hospitals are at risk of going into deficit as a result of budget freezes

The warning comes amid criticism from Unison that cuts to the NHS could risk patient safety in overstretched hospitals.

Unison surveyed almost 3,000 nurses from across the UK, and found that 65 per cent of staff said they didn’t have enough time with patients – with 55 per cent reporting that care was ‘left undone’ as a result.

The union also found that 45 per cent of staff had to look after eight or more patients at once during their shift. That compares to 5.2 in Norway and 6.9 in Ireland.

The figure in Britain rose to more than 50 per cent for night duty. It is claimed that looking after more than eight patients is considered unsafe – although there are no legal ratios in force.

The report, published at Unison’s health conference in Brighton yesterday, found that half of nurses have to work through their breaks on night shifts or stay late to complete their work. It also found that three out of five nurses said they were concerned that fewer staff had led to poor care.

Gail Adams, Unison’s head of nursing, said it was a ‘myth’ that night shifts were quiet – but that many organisations denied that and reduced the number of nurses. 

She said: ‘Nights are busy and often more stressful as less senior staff are around to call on for support or guidance.

‘Some patients need pain medication, some are distressed in an unfamiliar environment, sometimes patients cannot sleep and need someone to hold their hand. The Government needs to face up to the damage it is inflicting on patients and staff by not introducing legally enforceable nurse to patient ratios, and take urgent action.’

Chancellor George Osborne has consistently protected the Health Service from budget cuts. But because of rising costs due to Britain’s ageing population, the need for new technology, and the rising cost of medicine, the NHS in England has in effect had no real rise in spending since 2010 and there are already 65 trusts in deficit.

The Health Service’s budget will rise by only 0.1 per cent in 2014-15.

Richard Murray, the King’s Fund’s director of policy and former economic adviser at the Department of Health, said the Tories and Labour faced a ‘big political choice’. 

He told The Independent: ‘In the past each time the NHS has got very close to the wire, governments have found extra money.’

He added: ‘The Health Service now is a very large proportion of overall spending because it’s been protected while other areas of public spending have been cut back.

‘I don’t think any of the political parties are ready for this . . . it’s a difficult one with  deficit reduction so important and the NHS so important – they are stuck between a rock and a hard place.’
