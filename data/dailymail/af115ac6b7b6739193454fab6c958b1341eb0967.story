A 9,000-strong colony of penguins has been discovered in Antarctica after scientists spotted their poo trails in satellite images.

The huge emperor penguin colony had never encountered humans until researchers found them on Antarctica’s Princess Ragnhild Coast.

Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey noticed the trail in 2009 while studying satellite images of Antarctica and it was not until December last year that three researchers from the International Polar Foundation found the colony.

Alain Hubert, founder of the International Polar Foundation, said the penguins were curious rather than scared of them.

He was quoted by NPR saying: ‘When you arrive, they just come to see you, to watch you, to turn around you.

'The penguins, and especially the emperors, they are so human.'

Mr Hubert and his team had been investigating climate change from an Antarctic research station and 
after seeing a number of emperor penguins nearby, they thought a colony 
could be close by.

After a 30-mile trip across sea ice, the team searched for hours until they found so many penguins it felt like they were on another planet, Mr Hubert said.

He said: ‘I spent more than five years of my life in the polar regions, but that was the kind of moment that I wouldn't have expect[ed] to be able to ... just enjoy.’

While the amount of poo was substantial, Mr Hubert said that because of the cold temperatures, it did not smell but, had it been any warmer, it would have produced a stench.

Emperor penguins are the tallest of all penguin species and are the only penguin species that breed during the Antarctic winter.

They trek up to 75 miles over the ice to reach breeding colonies which are often made up of thousands of penguins.
