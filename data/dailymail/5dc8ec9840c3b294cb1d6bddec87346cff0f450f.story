Mohamed Salah might have been dismissed as a flop after just a year spent at Chelsea, but he's already proving popular in Italy after moving to Fiorentina on loan, with fans voting him Serie A's best January signing.

Things don't seem to be going too well for Lukas Podolski, on loan at Inter Milan from Arsenal, though. After being told he 'isn't doing enough' by manager Roberto Mancini he was ranked as the league's second-worst signing.

Podolski's only saving grace was AC Milan's loan purchase of Alessio Cerci, who topped the poll conducted by Gazzetta dello Sport with 44.9 per cent of fans rating him as top transfer flop.

Salah has started just three games for La Viola but has impressed supporters by bagging four goals, including one against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League.

He even scored the winning goal against Podolski's Inter side atthe San Siro on Sunday, with both players involved.

Podolski, on the other hand, has no goals in eight starts over in Milan and it looks increasingly likely that he will be sent back to north London come the end of the season.

Former Liverpool midfielder Suso was also high up on the flops list - although his fourth place ranking only comes from 2.8 per cent of the voting.
