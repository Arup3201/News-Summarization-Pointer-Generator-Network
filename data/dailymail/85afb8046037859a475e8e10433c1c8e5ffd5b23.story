A schoolboy with an 'extreme' hair style was escorted home by teachers who told him he wouldn't be allowed back in the classroom unless he had it cut.

The teachers at the Catholic school even offered to pay for Robert Hudson, 12, to visit a barber but his guardians refused.

Robert had his hair cut on Tuesday. The sides were shaved off but the top and back were left untouched.

'Extreme hair': Robert Hudson, 12, was escorted home by teachers at the English Martyrs School in Hartlepool, because of his trim

When he got to the English Martyrs School in Hartlepool, Cleveland, the following morning, after his £6 trim, he was told by teachers that he wouldn't be allowed into class.

They insisted that he would only be allowed to return if he had his hair cut into a more acceptable style and was escorted home within 20 minutes.

Staff at the school even offered to pay for a new haircut, but Robert's grandfather and legal guardian Brian Hudson refused the offer and said he was 'livid' with the whole situation.

But the school says their policy on haircuts is clear and children's attainment is linked to their appearance.

Mr Hudson, 58, accused the school of putting Robert's hairstyle before his education.

He said: 'They won't educate him because of his haircut but it doesn't state in their rules and regulations what type of haircut is permitted, all they say is it's not school policy.

'They say it is an extreme haircut. The member of staff explained because it is not level all the way round he won't be allowed in school until he gets it cut.

'If it was a Mohican or something I would agree, but it is away from his face and eyes.'They have even offered to take him to the barbers and pay to get it re-cut.

'I will certainly not let them do that. It annoys me to death. I am livid.'

English Martyrs' guidance says pupils' haircuts are expected to be 'reasonable' with no hair dye and adds incorporated shapes and patterns are not acceptable.

But Mr Hudson, unemployed, of the Oxford Road area of town, says they do not specify which styles of haircut are acceptable and which are banned.

Robert's attendance at school has recently dipped to 79 per cent because of health worries including asthma and a condition that makes his feet swell up, and his granddad is anxious the youngster does not miss any more time off school than is absolutely necessary.

He added: 'I think it is a smart haircut. They are putting a haircut over his education, which is wrong. If they think a haircut style is more important than a child's education, they want their heads looking at.

'If we kept him off school deliberately we will get prosecuted but they send him home because of his haircut. He wants to go to school. He thinks it's stupid.'

Michael Lee, headteacher of English Martyrs RC School and Sixth Form College, said: 'The school's hairstyle policy is in the School Prospectus and on our website along with other policies to ensure that parents/guardians are well aware of the standards we set at English Martyrs.

'The policy clearly states that hairstyles incorporating shapes/patterns are not acceptable and that any student attending with an unacceptable hairstyle will be unable to access lessons in the normal way until this has been attended to.

'In an effort to get Robert back into school, we did offer to pay for another haircut but unfortunately this was rejected by his family.

'Research by Ofsted shows that there is a clear correlation between high standards of behaviour, uniform and appearance and educational attainment and this view is shared by English Martyrs.'
