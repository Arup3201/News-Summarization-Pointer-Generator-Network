Everyone knows that Olympic success is the reward for a monastic life of self-denial, early nights and relentless training.

But even the most dedicated young sports heroes have an inner tiger just roaring to get out .  .  . as anyone who witnessed Bradley Wiggins celebrating his Sports Personality of the Year victory with his electric guitar could attest.

New Year’s Eve is just the occasion to let your hair down, when even the steeliest self-discipline can dissolve.

Happy new year: Perhaps mod cyclist Bradley Wiggins wanted to spend his new year in bed playing guitar?

Stable party: Zara Phillips could well have seen in 2013 with a bottle of bubbly and a party in the stables

One night of the year: And Mo Farah possibly even took a break from his strict training regime to enjoy a pizza on New Year's Eve

And here, award-winning photographer Alison Jackson, known for her use of celebrity lookalikes, imagines how Britain’s Olympians might have started 2013 – some of them possibly suffering the morning after the night before.

In real life, of course, some of the sporting heroes could hardly wait until the Games ended. The vamp of the velodrome, Victoria Pendleton, renounced Lycra for sequins almost as soon as the Olympic flame flickered its last, quickly signing up for Strictly Come Dancing.

Teenage diving sensation Tom Daley’s trunks were barely dry before he agreed  to host ITV’s new celebrity diving show Splash! Meanwhile he’s been enjoying the things he missed out on during those years of dedication; he’s even appeared in pantomime, making a guest appearance alongside Christopher Biggins in his home town of Plymouth.

And who would be surprised if fun-loving Zara Phillips – part of the silver-medal- winning eventing team – ended up drinking champagne in the straw, rather than through a straw, on New Year’s Eve?

Meanwhile, for Mo Farah real life has become even more punishing than his training regime. It was an emotional sight when he embraced his pregnant wife Tania as applause echoed round the Olympic  Stadium – but now he has to live with the arduous reality of four-month-old twin daughters Aisha and Amani keeping him awake at night.

Staying in: Diver Tom Daley may have preferred to stay at home this year, particularly as his wardrobe only seems to consist of trunks

Always at work: Never one to take much of a break, cyclist Victoria Pendleton could have been brushing up on her dance steps come midnight

Next move: Perhaps Victoria is even gearing up for a stint on Dancing On Ice?
