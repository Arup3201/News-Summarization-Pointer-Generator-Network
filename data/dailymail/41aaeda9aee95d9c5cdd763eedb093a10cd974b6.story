A seven-year-old brain tumour victim helped diagnose his mother's breast cancer after giving her a hug.

Michaela Dawson said were it not for the cuddle with her son Josh, a lump in her breast may have gone unnoticed.

As Josh climbed on to his mother's lap and pressed into her chest, Ms Dawson felt an unbearable, sharp pain.

She discovered a lump and booked a doctor's appointment.

Michaela Dawson was diagnosed with breast cancer in June, after her seven-year-old son Josh, pictured, climbed on her lap for a cuddle, causing the 47-year-old to suffer severe chest pain

The single mother said her world fell apart when her GP revealed a mammogram had revealed the lump was cancerous.

It was the second time the family had been struck by a cancer diagnosis.

In 2012, Josh was diagnosed with ependymoma, a rare brain tumour, which affects 450 people in the UK each year.

Ms Dawson, from Seaton Carew in Hartlepool, said: 'I was completely gutted after what our family went through with Josh, the first thing that came to my mind when they said it was cancer was "Oh here we go again".

'Josh is quite needy like any youngster, and he wanted to have a cuddle so he grabbed on to me. When one of his hands rested on me, I felt this blinding pain and had to sit down.

'He kept saying that I was hurt and when I touched the sore part of my breast, I felt a lump and my heart sank.

'I was given my diagnosis on Josh’s seventh birthday, if it wasn’t for that morning hug in June I may never have found the cancer.

'After Josh was diagnosed with a brain tumour two years ago, I kept thinking ‘why us again?’ I was numb after his ordeal.

'He had to go through life saving surgery to remove the cancer and we were afraid that was it.'

After a successful operation and radiotherapy treatment, Josh has now been given the all-clear.

Ms Dawson said: 'No one ever imagines that they will be affected by cancer, so to have to deal with it twice was a huge blow'

The mother-of-two has just undergone surgery to remove the tumour and half of the lymph nodes from her underarm.

Although the family are now facing fresh anguish after Ms Dawson's bombshell diagnosis, she is determined to be as brave as her son and to beat the cancer.

The former school cook, who is also mother to 22-year-old Stephanie, added: 'The surgery went well and although I am a bit sore, I keep thinking about how brave Josh was.

'He didn’t complain once during any of his treatment.

'I am due to start chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the next few weeks. If he can do it then so can I.

'No one ever imagines that they will be affected by cancer, so to have to deal with it twice was a huge blow.

'Even though it has come as a shock I want to do my son proud.'
