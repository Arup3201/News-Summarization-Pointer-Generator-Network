Whether the Holocaust happened is no longer up for debate at Southern California's Rialto Unified School District.

The
 initial assignment given to eighth-graders in the San Bernardino County
 district was to do some research and write an essay explaining whether 
they believed the Holocaust was a real historical event or a political 
scheme to influence public emotion and gain.

'It was an error,' district spokeswoman Syeda Jafri said Monday.

There has been massive outrage from anti-defamation groups upon learning that San Bernardino County eighth graders were asked to write an essay on whether the Holocaust was real

District spokesperson Syeda Jafri called it an 'error' that students were asked to write an essay explaining whether they believed the Holocaust was a real historical event or a political scheme to influence public emotion and gain

Several groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, called or emailed the school objecting to the assignment.

One person made a number of calls to police with some very specific death threats, said Rialto police Capt. Randy De Anda.

The threats were specific and directed at Jafri and interim Superintendent Mohammad Z. Islam, De Anda said.

There
 was no protest or any other action on campus Monday, but because the 
department takes death threats very seriously, De Anda said he and two 
officers were on campus checking them out.

'We
 believe he (the caller) is a white male in his 30s. He did give us a 
name, but we haven't confirmed it yet so we don't know it he's a 
previous student,' De Anda said.

Reaction to the assignment was so visceral there were death threats made against superintendent Mohammad Z. Islam

The department has all the calls on tape and will complete its investigation and forward it to the district attorney.

A
 team of teachers will meet to revise the assignment, Jafri said, and 
Islam will talk to the district's education services department to 
ensure all references to the Holocaust 'not occurring' are stricken on 
any current or future argumentative research assignment.

'The
 Holocaust should be taught in classrooms with sensitivity and profound 
consideration to the victims who endured the atrocities committed,' 
Jafri said. 'We believe in the words of George Santayana, those who 
cannot learn from history are bound to repeat it.'
