EasyJet cabin crew in France are set to strike on New Year's Eve and New Year's day that will cause delays and cancellations to flights. 

The airline's French cabin crew unions will follow up a Christmas strike over profit sharing and rotas with another two days of industrial action, a union source has said.

The initial strike, which began on December 25, led to around 40 cancellations at the UK airline's French operations on Friday.

'The responsibility for this new call for strike action rests with management, which has not contacted us,' an SNPNC-FO union source said.

French cabin crew unions called the initial strike to demand a larger share of Easyjet's French profits for employees and improved management of staffing rotas.

Staff voted to strike soon after the opening of annual negotiations on pay and conditions, according to the company. The airline has said it remains open to discussion and committed to finding an appropriate solution with unions.

Easyjet said its crews were 'among the best paid in the profession in France' and that staff had benefited from above-inflation pay rises since 2008.

Laurent Nicolas, a representative of the SNPNC-FO union that represents 600 easyJet flight attendants, said workers are upset over schedules that 'can change 20 times per month'.

He said the scheduling makes it impossible for employees to spend quality time with their families.

The union argues that the airline can afford a pay increase for flight attendants as its operating profits were up 21 per cent this year, reaching €728m (approximately £571m).

That has translated into huge bonuses for management and income that is up to 300 times the average salary of an easyJet flight attendant, the union claims.

Passengers flying from French airports on easyJet flights may be subjected to cancellations and delays

Thirty-eight easyJet flights were cancelled from French airports on Boxing Day, with British staff drafted in to help with the remaining flights.

A spokesperson for easyJet told MailOnline Travel: 'EasyJet has been advised of an easyJet cabin crew industrial action in France from December 31, 00:01, to January 1, 23:59, local time and can confirm that no UK flights will be affected by cancellations on 31st December.

'A small number of flights will be rescheduled so passengers are advised to check www.easyjet.com/flighttracker for the latest information.

'We would like to apologise and reassure customers that we are doing everything possible to minimise any disruption as a result of the industrial action. EasyJet remains open and committed to finding a suitable resolution with the unions'

Any passengers who are affected by cancelled or rescheduled flights will be contacted by easyJet and can either receive a full refund or rebook their travel for an alternative date free of charge so they are able to re-organise their travel plans.
