When my son David was small, he had a red anorak that he would not take off. He lived in it, slept in it, he even took his bath in it.

That may sound cute, and mildly eccentric, but it wasn’t. It was terrifying, for him, for his mother and for me. David found the world so bewildering that the idea of even unzipping his coat plunged him into screaming, head-battering panic.

David is autistic. He can barely communicate, or understand other people, or predict even the basic consequences of his actions.

A different world: Christopher Stevens with his autistic son David who is wearing his beloved red coat

That’s hard for anyone who doesn’t suffer from autism to imagine.

The new West End production of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time, which opened last week at the Apollo Theatre to ecstatic reviews, sets itself a colossal challenge: to do justice on stage to the often nightmarish world of autism.

For parents and siblings, neighbours and teachers, autism is difficult to understand. But we should all at least try to do so, because an estimated half a million people in Britain alone are ‘on the autistic spectrum’ — though thankfully, not many are as severely affected as David.

The play is based on novelist Mark Haddon’s award-winning book of the same name, published nine years ago. It tells the story of a 15-year-old boy, Christopher (played on stage by Luke Treadaway), who can solve complex mathematical puzzles in his head but is so socially incapable that he cannot dress or feed himself properly.

Haddon never states explicitly that Christopher is autistic, but he depicts many  of the symptoms of one type of autism, Asperger’s syndrome, with clinical accuracy.

Anyone who wants to understand the condition better should see this production. It’s a gripping experience with plenty of unexpected laughs . . . a bit like bringing up a child with autism. It powerfully conveys how it actually feels to be one of those  half-million with the condition.

But don’t take an autistic person with you: the lights and the noise of the production are shattering.

When Christopher is overwhelmed by confusing stimuli — crowds, chatter, laughter, physical contact with other people — the stage becomes ablaze with flashing diodes and thunderous, bass-heavy music. It makes you want to screw up your eyes and press your thumbs into your ears, the classic autistic response to over-stimulation.

Treadaway’s sensitively observed performance captures many of the details of autistic behaviour. He constantly twiddles the cords of his hoodie around his fingers, waggling his hands like a pianist limbering up for a concerto.

That’s something my son does whenever he is agitated. He once twiddled a fridge magnet (in the shape of a  capital Q), so obsessively that it became stuck on his finger and had to be dislodged with cutters in A&E.

David sees other people as machines — as objects that he must learn to operate — and so he pushes, nudges, drags and steers them into position. He can’t explain what he wants us to do, so he must move us accordingly.

Playwright Simon Stephens’s adaptation of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time makes clear this tendency by using actors as props: Christopher sits on them, rides on them, wipes his feet on them, even uses one as a cashpoint.

Autism is nothing if not self-centred. For Christopher, the only possible viewpoint on the world is his own.

In one subtly observed exchange, a neighbour tells him: ‘I don’t want to see you at the moment.’

Christopher obligingly turns his back. He can’t see her and so, according to his faultless logic, she can’t see him.

In the same way, when David waves to us, he keeps the palm of his hand towards his face. After all, when we wave to him, he can see our palms, so it makes perfect sense for him to see the lines on his own hand when he waves back.

Because people with autism are typically indifferent to what others think, peer pressure is irrelevant.

In the play, Christopher loves playing with Thomas The Tank Engine. He always has done and he feels no need to ‘grow up’. But for his parents, that never-ending childhood is embarrassing and exhausting. ‘It’s like he’s just a big baby,’ his despairing dad shouts.

Even more draining are the obsessions of an autistic child, the endlessly repeated questions and monologues.

Christopher is ‘highly verbal’ — he can talk fluently, but his conversation gets stuck in ruts. He recites facts about astronomy for hours, and repeats cringingly awkward questions over and over. His dad is close to the end of his tether, but Christopher is oblivious.

There are heart-stopping moments (at one point, the man next to me was leaning so far forward in suspense that he slid off his seat).

Christopher is frightened of many things, but he has no instinct for real danger. My son is the same. He would step out into moving traffic without a qualm. After all, it has always stopped for him before, every time he’s crossed the road. Why should it ever be different?

And when Christopher has a meltdown in a store, surrounded by outraged shoppers, I wanted to stand up and yell: ‘Oh, yes — been there!’

By the way, a plea to the general public: when a harassed parent is coping with an autistic meltdown, it’s not helpful to shout: ‘What that child needs is a damn good smack!’

The Curious Incident is about more than autism; it also offers a hard-eyed depiction of a relationship between a mother and father that has been ripped apart, piece by painful piece, under the strain of caring for a child with special needs.

My wife Nicky and I have been fortunate. Our marriage has coped, perhaps because we have an older son who has been a dependable source of good humour and calm throughout it all.

But caring for an autistic child 24 hours a day for years on end takes its toll: marriages and careers collapse, debts mount up, and stress-related illnesses and drink problems are common. The play tackles this side of dealing with autism without flinching.

It also shows how bizarre family life can become when it is always contorted to accommodate the arbitrary needs of an autistic mind.

Christopher hates to be touched, so his father can never hug him. Instead, they touch fingertips, like E.T. and  the little boy he befriends in Spielberg’s film.

Anything can seem normal if it happens often enough. For years, my left arm was bruised because of David’s helpful habit of prodding it with his foot from the back seat when it was time to use the indicator while driving: one tap with the toe to the elbow when turning left, one thwhack to the bicep for right.

Seems unthinkable, doesn’t it? But you don’t just get used to these things, they become part of the fabric of your life. You might think Christopher’s father in the play can’t cope with his son for a moment longer — until you see him trying to cope without him.

While the play gets a great deal right, not everything rings true. A promised Saturday outing for Christopher is cancelled because his dad wants to watch an England football game on the telly.

This seemed to me utterly unrealistic. That sort of luxury, sadly, is an impossibility for single parents of autistic teenagers.

In one sequence, Christopher daydreams about the sensation of floating in space. It’s beautifully staged but out of character.

Imagination, the mental power to see in the mind’s eye something that hasn’t happened, is absent  in autism.

Those are quibbles. There are some graver misunderstandings.

I was saddened by the portrayal of Christopher’s head teacher as a lazy, spiteful jobsworth. Heaven knows that parents with disabled children have to deal with various incompetent and obstructive officials, but in my experience, the great majority of special needs teachers are dedicated and inspiring individuals.

David is nearly 17 now, and he’s had many teachers. Energy, determination and selflessness have been hallmarks of all of them.

It’s a pity, too, that Christopher had to be portrayed with a special talent: an outstanding gift for maths. This gift gives momentum to the story, of course, and it provides a theme for the staging (the set is lined like graph-paper and Christopher draws on it in chalk, the way Einstein used to scrawl on blackboards).

I’ve known plenty of autistic children but never one with a superpower — or, at least, not a useful one.

My son David has the uncanny ability to identify any Disney video cassette without looking at it, simply by picking it up and rattling it when it’s been removed from its case.

I don’t just mean that he can tell The Lion King apart from 101 Dalmatians with his eyes closed. I mean that at 4am, in a pitch-black room with 500 videos piled on the floor, he can locate that one copy of The Lion King that he’s looking for by the rattle alone.

It’s not quite a superpower, but it is a remarkable talent and unique to my beloved, exhausting and eternally curious son.

I wish I knew how.
