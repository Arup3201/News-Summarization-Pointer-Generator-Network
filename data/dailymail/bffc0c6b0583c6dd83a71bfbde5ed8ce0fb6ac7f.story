Years before Jodi Arias went on trial for allegedly murdering her boyfriend, the young woman told CBS's 48 Hours that she would have gained nothing from the gristly slaying.

During a 10-day lull in the courtroom proceedings, CBS is planning to re-air the conversation with Arias, which was originally recorded in 2008, just months after the woman's former boyfriend, Travis Alexander, was found stabbed, shot and brutally mutilated in his apartment in suburban Mesa, Arizona.

During the no-holds-barred 48 Hours interview, Arias discussed the night Alexander died, their illicit sexual encounters and her fondness for taking explicit photos of the lovers that are now being used as evidence in her murder trial.

Jailhouse talk: Jodi Arias sat down for a 48 Hours interview with a CBS reporter in 2008 to talk about the night Travis Alexander was murdered

Bogus tale: At the time, Arias said that she and Alexander were attacked by a pair of men who assaulted her lover with a knife and gun

'I’ve been sitting a lot in my cell thinking, "What a waste," you know? I did have my whole future ahead of me,' Arias told a reporter five years ago. 'I had everything to lose and nothing to gain if I killed Travis. I loved him and still love him,' RadarOnline reported.

The 32-year-old California resident could face the death penalty if convicted of murdering the 30-year-old Alexander in June 2008.

Arias is accused of stabbing the Mormon real estate agent and motivational speaker 27 times, shooting him in the face and slitting his throat from ear to ear in the shower of his apartment after the two had a sexual encounter.

In mid-August 2008, two months after the gruesome slaying that had shaken the Mesa community, Arias sat down with CBS reporter Maureen Maher for a jailhouse interview that eventually made it into the 48 Hours segment called Picture Perfect - The Trial of Jodi Arias.

In the course of the lengthy talk, the media-savvy suspect offered her fabricated version of events, claiming that after she and Alexander had had sex, two men dressed in black broke into his home and attacked the 30-year-old with a knife and a gun. 

On trial: Jodi Arias is charged with murder in the June 2008 death of her on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander

Heavy penalty: If convicted, Arias could get the death penalty, becoming just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row

Her lover was stabbed on the floor, 
but Arias said she managed to escape. She added that she never told 
anyone about the deadly attack because she was afraid, but she was 
certain at the time that Alexander was alive. 

'It
was the scariest experience of my life,' she said of the bogus home 
invasion. 'It was just so unreal. It was like a move unfolding. Like a 
horrible movie.'

Police have
since exposed Arias' tale as a boldfaced lie, and even her defense 
attorneys said that their client was not telling the truth in the wake 
of the murder.

Arias 
eventually changed her story, telling investigators that she killed 
Alexander in self-defense, describing him as a sexually promiscuous, 
brutal man who sought to control her.

On Thursday, jurors in the Arias 
trial were shown graphic photos of the defendant and her slain paramour 
taken on the day of his murder.

In some of the pictures, Alexander appears alive in the shower, while another image captured his dead body on the floor. 

The day before, a videotaped 
interrogation of the 32-year-old was played in court. A detective 
grilled Arias, explaining that all the evidence points to her. She 
insisted she did not kill him.

Mesa police detective Esteban Flores continued to press her on the tape.

Conflicting words: Jurors in the trial watched a videotaped interrogation of Arias Wednesday during which she insists she didn't kill Travis Alexander, right, but says if she had, she would have killed him quickly and humanely

‘You shot him in the head, then you got a knife and you stabbed him,’ Flores said. ‘Jodi, tell me the truth, please.’

‘I did not kill Travis,’ Arias 
replied. However, she said if she were to have killed him, she couldn't 
have stabbed him. It would have been too cruel.

‘I don't think I could stab him. I 
think I would have to shoot him until he was dead if that were my 
intentions,’ Arias told the detective. ‘But I would have to wear gloves.

‘If I had it in me to kill him, the least I could have done was make it as humane as possible,’ she added.

If found guilty of murder, Arias would become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row.

She allegedly stabbed and slashed 
Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat from ear to ear, and shot
him in the head around June 4, 2008, at his Mesa home. His body was 
found five days later in his shower by roommates.

Bloodied: Investigators described the 2008 crime scene as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen

Prosecutors say Arias came prepared 
to kill the 30-year-old devout Mormon, businessman and motivational 
speaker, and neglected to call police after leaving behind a crime scene
that investigators described as among the most gruesome they'd ever 
seen.

They say she attacked him in a 
jealous rage after he broke up with her. She says she broke up with him 
after about five months of dating, but the two continued to see each 
other sexually.

Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, 
told jurors in opening statements that Alexander ‘lunged at Jodi in 
anger’ on the day he was killed, and she had to defend herself.

When the trial resumes January 29, 
both the prosecution and the defense plan on playing parts from the 48 
Hours interview for the jurors. The trial is expected to last through April.

The 48 Hours segment dedicated to Jodi Arias and her murder trial airs on CBS January 19 at 10pm
