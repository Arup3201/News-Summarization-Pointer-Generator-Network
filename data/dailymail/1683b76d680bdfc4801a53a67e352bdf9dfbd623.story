Unsurprisingly, the 'new' app lets you apply retro-style filters to photographs - just like on Instagram

Facebook has created a new, free camera app, just weeks after its $1BN purchase of photo-sharing site Instagram.

Unsurprisingly, the 'new' app lets you apply retro-style filters to photographs - just like on Instagram.

It also offers a photo-only feed of all Friend's Facebook posts.

'Today, we're introducing Camera, a new mobile app that makes using Facebook photos faster and easier,' says Facebook, 'When you launch the app, you'll see a feed of just great photos from the people you care about.

'Now you can quickly share multiple photos all at once instead of having to post one at a time. Just select the shots you want to share by tapping the check-mark on each photo and then hit post.'

It's not clear, though, how the new app relates to Instagram - its release date suggests it was created by a different team, and sites such as The Verge have reported it was created internally, rather than by Instagram staff.

'We also know, according to the Wall Street Journal, that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg negotiated with Instagram mostly on his own, and told his board of directors about plans to buy the photo firm mere days before the acquisition went public,' says Wired.

'It's also easy to edit photos with new tools like the ability to crop, rotate and add filters to any picture in your camera roll,' says Facebook.

The app's filters are slightly more limited than the ones offered by Instagram and other rivals.

The app is free, and joins a series of 'separate' mobile apps offered by Facebook on IPhone and Android recently, such as Messenger, but the network giant swiftly 'pulled' the apps.

Camera, though, seems likely to be longer-lived - as the company is clearly serious about photo-sharing.
