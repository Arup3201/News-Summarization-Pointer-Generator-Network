The funeral of a loved one can be a stressful enough occasion at the best of times.

But when grieving daughter Anne Usher, 60, turned up to a cemetery in Glossop, Derbyshire to bury her mother Barbara Jones, 82, she found her grave had not even been dug yet.

She has now won an apology from council officials after a string of graveyard bungles turned her mother’s funeral into a 'plot from a Carry On film.'

Grieving: Anne Usher (pictured holding photos of her mother Barbara and father Don) has won an apology from council officials after a string of graveyard bungles at Glossop cemetery in Derbyshire turned her mother's funeral into a ''plot from a Carry On film''

Blunders: Mrs Usher (pictured at her mother Barbara Jones' grave, left) was left waiting for two and a half hours while workmen dug the grave. When the family returned to the cemetery (pictured, right) the new grave was found to be too small for Mrs Jones' coffin

The funeral cortege agreed to wait at Mrs Jones’s home for two and half hours whilst gravediggers were hurriedly called to the scene but when they returned for the cemetery, they found the grave was too small for her coffin to fit in

Relatives burst into tears whilst other mourners squirmed in embarrassment as the coffin clattered against the edge of the grave before sticking out at an angle.

When Mrs Usher complained about the funeral it emerged cemetery workers had wrongly dug another grave by mistake in preparation for the service.

Officials at High Peak Council today apologised for the blunders and agreed to pay the £2,800 costs of the funeral.

But Mrs Usher, of Glossop, Derbyshire, said her mother would have been 'disgusted' by what happened.

'You put your trust in those who are sorting out the funeral and do not expect this,' she said.

'All I wanted [was] a farewell fitting for a lady who was so well known and respected in the area. But this wasn’t the dignified end we had expected.

'In a sad kind of way the funeral reminded me of a Carry On film - but with no laughs at the end.'

Widow Mrs Jones who died in June from liver cancer had run a newsagents in Glossop with her late husband Don for 55 years until she retired in 2008.

Errors: Bungling workers dug up the grave of Mrs Usher's father Don (pictured here with Mrs Usher in 2007) by mistake thinking her mother Barbara would be buried with him

Respect: Mrs Usher lays flowers at her father's grave. She said that all she had wanted was a fitting send off for her mother Barbara Jones, who was well-respected in the local community

The funeral was planned by her family for June 25 at a church in the town attended by 40 mourners before the cortege moved onto the cemetery.

Mrs Usher, a carer added: 'My mother didn’t request anything for her own funeral - all she wanted was to be buried with her mum and brother.

'I thought that it would be nice for the cortege to go past the business as it was her life and she was very well known and respected.

'It was a lovely service but when we drove into the cemetery I had a funny feeling something wasn’t right as there was nobody there and there were no workmen about.

'The funeral director said to me ‘just hang on and I’ll go and find out what’s happening’ and I knew that something was wrong.

'The funeral director then said ‘I’m sorry I don’t know how to tell you this but they have not dug the grave.

'I think everyone could tell that there was something wrong by my face I was just in shock and I was frozen. I could not comprehend what they were telling me.'

Mrs Usher said her family were then told to go back to her mother's home where they waited for two and a half hours while the diggers prepared the grave.

Mrs Jone's body was taken back to the undertakers. 'It’s not nice to think that she was going back and forth,' said Mrs Usher.

'It wasn’t in the least bit dignified and me, my family and friends were all very upset when we got back to my mum’s house.

'The mood was very sombre and everyone was talking about what had just happened, it was heart-breaking.

'Almost two and a half hours later, somebody said to me ‘your mum’s back’ and the hearse was outside.

'It was like a re-run of the morning and we went down the same route even going past the business again.

'Everyone was looking and you could see them doing a double take because they’d already seen us go past once. It was embarrassing.'

Mrs Usher said that when they returned to the cemetery the workers were still digging the grave.

Farcical: The blunders of cemetery workers ruined Mrs Jone's funeral at Glossop Cemetery (pictured) and left her family devastated. The council has since apologised for the mistakes

'When we got to the gave we found that the workmen had not dug down very far,' she said.

'When the coffin was being lowered it went in at a slant.

'The head of the coffin was about three inches from the top of the ground and the bottom of the coffin was about 10 inches from the top.

'She shouldn’t have been taken down like that, we watched as the top went in on a slant it and it was sticking up. I was at the front crying, I was very upset.

Mrs Usher said that everybody present at the funeral was 'mortified,' by what happened.

'I still feel physically sick it shocks me that much,' she said.

'At the end of the day these people can apologise all they want but it is not personal to them, it was not their mother.

'My mum did not deserve that and it should not happen to anyone. It is going to be something which people always chat about but not for the right reasons.“It is not going to be remembered with people saying ‘wasn’t it a nice funeral’ but instead ‘can you believe what happened.

Enquiries revealed cemetery bosses had mistakenly dug up the grave of Anne’s father wrongly believing Mrs Jones was going to be buried with him.

High Peak Council’s Executive councillor for community services Anthony McKeown said: 'We have apologised unreservedly to Mrs Usher for the distress caused by the events surrounding the burial of Barbara Jones.

'We have offered to meet the entire cost of the funeral, and have introduced procedures to ensure that mistakes of this nature do not reoccur.

'The new procedures mean that no one person has sole responsibility for taking burial details from funeral directors and for issuing work to cemetery staff.

'As a result, measures are now in place to ensure that all stages of the booking process are checked and that grave digging instructions are issued to staff correctly.

'The grave of Mr Jones was re-turfed as soon as possible after the day in question and will continue to be monitored.

'Meanwhile, the grave of Barbara Jones has been tidied in readiness for the kerbs to be reinstated. A formal letter of apology has been written to Mrs Usher.'
