A tribe of indigenous people are under threat from an epidemic sweeping through the forests of Paraguay.

Members of the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode group have been struck down with a mysterious tuberculosis-like respiratory illness that is slowly killing them.

The people have been forced out of isolation due to deforestation for decades, and once they come into contact with society, they do not have the immunisation to tackle disease.

The Ayoreo-Totobiegosode tribe in Paraguay is being struck down with a mysterious tuberculosis-like respiratory illness. Member Chiri Etacore is shown healthy in 2000, pictured left, and seriously ill in 2011, pictured right. Etacore was the most recent death from the illness and he died in October 2013

Despite its similarities to TB, many tribe members suffering from the mysterious disease have tested negative for tuberculosis, and doctors have been left baffled.

Survival International, a human righta organisation that campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal and 'uncontacted' people, is warning the tribe may be wiped out unless the illness is identified and treated.

‘The deadly epidemic threatens to wipe out Paraguay's recently contacted Ayoreo tribe, and sets a deadly precedent for their relatives still hiding in the forests, who are the last uncontacted Indians outside the Amazon,’ said the organisation.

The Totobiegosode is an indigenous 
sub-group of the Ayoreo people living along the Gran Chaco which 
stretches from Argentina into Paraguay. Some members are also found in 
Bolivia.

Since the 1940s, numerous attempts have been made to contact the tribe and many members have been forced from their homes since the late 1960s due to local farmers reclaiming the land, and deforestation.

Nguiejna Etacoro was contacted in 2004, pictured left, and has been suffering from the illness since 2007, right. Despite its similarities to TB, many tribe members studied have tested negative for the illness and doctors are baffled by what it is, and how to treat it. As a result of their isolation, they are not immunised against disease

Since the 1940s, local governments 
and groups have made numerous attempts to contact the tribe, and during 
the 1970s and 80s many tribe members have been forced from their river and forest 
villages towards the towns.

More
 recently, during the 1990s and again in 2004, tribe members were placed
 in settlements so the land they were living on could be reclaimed.

The
 most recent Ayoreo victim killed by the respiratory disease, called 
Chiri Etacore, was forced out of the forest in 1986 and died in October 
last year.

The Totobiegosode is an indigenous sub-group of the Ayoreo people living along the Gran Chaco which stretches from Argentina into Paraguay. Some members are also found in Bolivia.

As many as three hundred Totobiegosode are said to have chosen to live in isolation and as a result they’re considered the most isolated of all Ayoreo.

The name translates as ‘people from the place of the wild pigs’.

The tribe live in small villages along rivers, and grow a number of crops such as squashes, beans and melons. They also hunt and gather.

Some groups still live uncontacted, or in voluntary isolation, but may still be under threat from the epidemic as it spreads through the land. Ibore Picanerai, pictured, was healthy when she was forced out of the forest in 1998, left, and contracted the illness in 2003, right. She died in 2009

They are believed to the only ‘uncontacted’ indigenous people living south of the Amazon basin. 

Since the 1940s, local governments and groups have made numerous attempts to contact the tribe, and during the 1970s and 80s many were forced from their river and forest villages towards the towns. 

More recently, during the 1990s and again in 2004, tribe members were placed in settlements so the land they were living on could be reclaimed. 

Some groups still live uncontacted, or in voluntary isolation, but are under threat from deforestation. 

In 2010, an expedition in search of new species of plants and insects, organised by the Natural History Museum in London, was suspended when concerns were raised that Ayoreo people might be encountered and disturbed.

Almost all the Ayoreo members who have been forced from their lands have suffered from the rare disease in one form or another.

Some groups still live uncontacted, or in voluntary isolation, but may still be under threat from the epidemic as it spreads through the land.

‘When uncontacted people are forced into contact with outside society disease swiftly follows.

'Here is proof that forced contact is nothing more than a death sentence for tribal peoples.

'Paraguay must act now to protect the lives of the last uncontacted Indians outside Amazonia,’ said Survival's director Stephen Corry.
