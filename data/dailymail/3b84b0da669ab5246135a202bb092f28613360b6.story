The entire Cabinet was sent into a panic thinking that the royal baby had arrived during a meeting at Chequers.

But the piece of paper rushed into a meeting yesterday was not an update from the palace but the latest from Lord's.

The
Prime Minister had instructed officials to keep him informed of the 
score from the Ashes match between England and Australia.

Mix-up: David Cameron, who spent the day watching the second Ashes test at Lord's, revealed on Radio 4 that yesterday's Cabinet meeting was disrupted by an update on the match

Chilling: David Cameron was in the stands at Lord's for the second Ashes test as MPs began their six-week

David
Cameron revealed how royal baby fever swept through his senior 
ministers as he spent the day at Lord’s watching day two of the second 
Ashes test.

As MPs began 
their six-week summer recess, the PM rushed to Lord’s in north London to
catch England batting their way to 361 all out.

Speaking
on BBC’s Test Match Special during the lunch break, Mr Cameron revealed
how his interest in yesterday's match had triggered panic around the Cabinet 
table.

He said: ‘We had a 
Cabinet meeting and I asked someone to bring in the cricket score half 
way through just to see how it was going.

‘And a bit of paper arrived in the Cabinet room and everyone of course thought it was an announcement about the royal baby.

‘There
was a great intake of breath and actually it was because Ken Clarke 
wanted to know what the score was because he was meant to be at Lord’s.’

Unusually
Cabinet ministers held their weekly meeting at Chequers, the Prime 
Minister’s country retreat, yesterday instead of in Downing Street.

The stately pile boasts tennis courts and a swimming pool but Mr Cameron’s official spokesman denied it was a ‘jolly’.

Today
the Prime Minister seemed delighted to have started parliament's long  
summer break with a few hours in the sunshine watching the cricket.

He said: 'It's such a glorious sight coming here, the sun shining, England playing well.

'It always such a wonderful thing to see. I was a bit late and thought this morning that I wouldn't see England batting.'

Asked
by former cricketer and broadcaster Geoffrey Boycott to join him at to 
watch a match at Headingley, Mr Cameron replied: 'We could have a day 
when we cancel Question Time and all come to the cricket.'

Ahead of the Ashes Mr Cameron hailed 
the competition as the ‘big one’ and warned Britain had ‘high hopes’ for
Alistair Cook’s side as it took on the Australian’s.

He
added: ‘Now whether you remember Botham and Willis at Headingley, like I
do, or Kevin Pietersen’s defiant stance at the Oval in 2005 - I 
remember where I was when that happened - nothing captures the public’s 
imagination quite like a Test match against Australia.

‘The nation’s got high hopes. We’re right behind the team, and I’m sure they’re going to rise to the occasion.’

The visit to the cricket is just the 
start of a long summer for Mr Cameron, who has previously been accused 
of spending too long chillaxing.

He
is expected to take two holidays this summer - one in Cornwall and one 
in Scotland – in the middle of his campaign against independence.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will be away at the same time, leaving William Hague and Theresa May in charge of the country.

The
PM and his deputy are to leave the country on holiday at the same time 
this summer – despite having six weeks to ensure one of them stays in 
charge of the country.

Mr 
Clegg revealed earlier this month that he had been unable to co-ordinate
his family holiday so it did not clash with the Camerons’, and other 
ministers will be left to ‘hold the fort’.

After leaving Lord's the Prime Minister travelled to the Olympic Park to hand out goody bags to Olympic Games Makers who were there to celebrate one year on from the Olympic and Paralympic Games

Every
year Mr Clegg and his family go to the same village in Spain where his 
wife Miriam’s family is from. They will be accompanied by their three 
children Antonio, Alberto and Miguel.

But like millions of schoolchildren, MPs couldn’t wait to start their six week summer holiday last night.

But
without the chance to watch a DVD or play Buckaroo on the green benches
of the House of Commons hardly any politicians bothered turning up for 
the last day of the parliamentary term.

Maybe MPs can be forgiven for needing a break – it has been a whole month since the last time the Commons had a recess.

At 5.20pm yesterday Commons John Bercow moved to adjourn the House of Commons until September 2.

It means there will be no new legislation, no debates and no Prime Minister’s Questions for six long weeks.

MPs argue they will spend the summer working in their constituencies.

With
the general election now less than two years away, those with the 
smallest majorities would be sensible to use the time to win over more 
voters.

However the chance to get away for a holiday – or two – will prove too great for most.

As the Commons wound down yesterday it seemed most MPs have started their break early.

Fewer than 50 of the 650 MPs turned out to see Business Secretary Vince Cable answer questions on the economy at 9.30am.

By 1.30pm the numbers had dwindled to a couple of dozen for a debate on an EU-US Trade and Investment Agreement.

As the clock ticked on to 4pm the number of MPs left for a general debate was struggling to get into double figures.

And just three were left when Tory MP Bill Cash had a debate on HM Revenue and Customs.

10.02am: On the last day of term yesterday just a few dozen MPs turned up in the Commons to grill Business Secretary Vince Cable

1.37pm: By lunchtime they were struggling to get into double figures on the green benches

5pm: With most people still hard at work in the country, just three MPs could be seen in the Commons chamber before it packed up for the summer

In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election. Some in Westminster predict it could be even lower this year.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Any MP worth their salt will be busy in their constituency during the summer recess.

‘However, the long break means that ministers will get away without being scrutinised in Parliament for six whole weeks by the people we elect to hold them to account.

‘Week in, week out, we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions, which means Bills are getting passed by MPs without having been subject to detailed scrutiny.

‘This is bad for democracy and reducing the length of the recesses would make more time available for the Commons to properly debate new laws and hold the Government to account.’
