Their lyrics include the line 'don't need make-up' but that hasn't stopped boyband One Direction from capitalising on their female fans' adulation by launching a cosmetics range.

Despite twittering about their love of unadorned ladies in their hit single What Makes You Beautiful ('Don't need make-up to cover up, being the way that you are is enough', go the lyrics), the teen hearthrobs have unveiled the 'Little Things' beauty range, which will sell for pocket money prices.

A collaboration with high street beauty brand MUA, nothing in the purse-friendly collection costs more than Â£2.50 and the range includes lipsticks, lip gloss, cheek tints and nail polish.

Unlikely beauty gurus: One Direction are to put a unique spin on looking good courtesy of their new make-up

Big seller? The range will include shades inspired by both band members and song titles

Nailed it: Each of the five polishes is chosen by a band member, and include green for Liam Payne and hot pink for Harry Styles

The Lip Polish products come in a different colour and flavour for every band member and are available in Harry loves Strawberry, Zayn loves Watermelon, Louis loves Vanilla, Niall loves Cherry and Liam loves Blueberry.

Meanwhile, the 'Kiss You' Lipstick range is named after their songs, with shades that include 'Be Mine', 'Moments', 'I Wish', 'Rock Me' and 'I Want'.

Last but not least, the boys have each put their face to a different shade of nail polish, with Harry Styles plumping for hot pink and Liam Payne choosing emerald green.

Lipsticks and lip polishes come decorated with autographs, while polish bottles come with plectrum charms featuring photographs of One Direction band members.

They were quick to comment on MUA's official website, gushing, 'I just screamed a little bit' and making jokes such as, 'Harry Styles' colour should be called Cougar Crimson.'

Fans have been tweeting about the range too, and despite some initial scepticism, the reception has been generally warm.
