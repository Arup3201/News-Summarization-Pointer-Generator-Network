The Duke and Duchess of Rutland in 2004

An events organiser for the Duke and Duchess of Rutland has been spared jail after he admitted killing a pensioner in a car crash because the judge ruled he was a 'young man with prospects'.

George Padley, 25, veered his Audi TT into the path of 79-year-old Derek Hall as he drove home from Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire.

As a result of Padley's 'momentary lapse' of concentration, Mr Hall swerved and lost control of his car and ploughed into a wall.

Mr Hall suffered fatal injuries after 
the crash which happened as he drove along the A153 dual carriageway at 
Wilsford, Lincolnshire, on August 23, 2011.

Padley,
of Anwick, Lincolnshire, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless 
driving when he appeared at Lincoln Crown Court on Friday.

He was spared jail and was instead ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for a year.

Judge Sean Morris told him: 'You are a
young man with prospects who on that day was returning from work.

'You 
are a decent, hard-working, law abiding young man.

'Whatever it was that caused you to lose full attention that day was a lapse, that is it, with the most appalling consequences.'

Padley
at the time worked as an events organiser for the Duke and Duchess of 
Rutland - the couple who publicly announced they now live in separate 
wings of their cascading Belvoir Castle following the break down of the 
marriage.

Padley was travelling home from Belvoir when he drifted 12-18 inches into the carriageway in front of Mr Hall, the court heard.

Prosecutor Jeremy Janes said: 'This was a momentary lapse with no aggravating features whatsoever.

'It was carelessness not any deliberateness on his part

'Nothing I can say can describe the loss the whole family (of Mr Hall) feels.

Sharp shooting: Belvoir Castle was one of 
the locations for the 2009 film The Young Victoria, which starred Emily 
Blunt as the queen and Rupert Friend as Prince Albert

'He was a loving husband, father and grandfather. A decent man in every sense of the word.'

John Lloyd-Jones, defending, said Padley hit the side of his head and had no recollection of the incident.

He told the court: 'His stance has always been if I am guilty I will plead guilty.

'Whether it was complacency on his part we donâ€™t know.'
