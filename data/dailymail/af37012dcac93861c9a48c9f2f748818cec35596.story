Australia's lesbian finance minister has added a tiny addition to her life with her partner - showing off their new baby to the world today

Just a week after she backed the the Labour Party's stance on gay marriage, Penny Wong announced that she and her partner Sophie Allouache have a bouncing baby girl.

'This is a life-changing experience,' said the 43-year-old Senator.

'She's wonderful, just wonderful.'

Baby Alexandra was born at Adelaide's Women's and Children's Hospital a week after Miss Wong supported a hard-fought change to the Labour Party's platform on gay marriage.

While same-sex marriages have yet to be legalised, gay people throughout Australia have celebrated Labour's support - but it has led to the resignation from the party of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's sister.

Miss Loree Rudd said she could not work for a party that endorsed homosexuals marrying.

While her brother had introduced laws when he was Prime Minister so gay people were not discriminated against, she said that 'to make that huge leap from their rights to breaking a commandment of Moses, to say homosexuals' relations is marriage, is utter nonsense.'

Miss Wong said that both mother and child were well, although partner Sophie was 'pretty tired'.

The baby, weighing in at 7.1lbs, was conceived from a donor known to the couple, but he will not be identified.

'Sophie and I are delighted beyond words - she's just beautiful.'

Miss Wong said she had sent a text to Prime Minister Julia Gillard with the news and the Prime Minister had replied that she was delighted.

'The PM's given me a bit of leave, so I'm going to take time off' she told Sydney's Daily Telegraph.

'Hopefully we can get the important things in life, like feeding and nappy changing and sleeping under control.'

Miss Wong and her partner showed off their baby on the same day that it was revealed a Catholic school was ordered to accept the daughter of a same sex couple following the intervention of the church.

The Sacred Heart Primary School in the outback town of Broken Hill had refused to take the girl into its kindergarten because of her female parents' same sex relationship.

When Acting Bishop Kevin Manning heard about the ban, he ordered the school to take the girl.

He told the Australian Broadcasting Commission that the refusal came about because of a misunderstanding on the part of the school principal and parish priest as to the church's position on the issue.

Mr Trevor Rynne, principal of the Sacred Heart school, confirmed the young girl had been rejected because of her parents' relationship, but he declined to comment further.

NSW politician John Kaye, from the Greens party, said the school's action had been offensive and indefensible.
