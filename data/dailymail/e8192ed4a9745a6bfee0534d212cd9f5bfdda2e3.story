The place Julian Assange's father has long called home is set to go under the hammer for more than $1 million.

While his son, who is the founder of Wikileaks, is still seeking refuge in the Ecuador's embassy, John Shipton is set to make a tidy fortune on the two-bedroom that his partner Catherine Barber bought in 1989 for $130,000.

Tucked away in the corner of the peaceful Kent Street, the vibrant home set on 247sqm is a treasure-trove of beautiful and original decorative finishes after being rebuilt by Shipton in the 1990s.

Positioned on the doorstep of Newtown's buzzing strip, the quirky haven is a short walk to parks, cafes and public transport on King Street in Sydney's trendy inner west. 

The property was originally built in the 1870s as the servant's quarters to a Victorian villa next door.

The spacious open plan living and dining pavilion boasts bright coloured lead-light doors with beautiful arched timber ceilings and mosaic walls looking out onto two private courtyards and a stunning walk-through atrium garden - not to mention a roof-top garden.

The bathroom features free-standing bath complete with a rain shower and marble, alabaster and tessellated mosaic mirror detailing. 

The rustic kitchen has arched windows with a quaint stove while the spacious bedrooms have built-in wardrobes

Domain labelled the home House of the Week last week describing it as being 'a work of art you can live in' which is 'entirely unconventional'.

The property goes to auction on March 14 for $1.1 million through Shaun Stoker and Ercan Ersan, of Ray White Surry Hills.

Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder, separated with Assange's mother before he was born.

Assange has sought political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 2012 after Britain attempted to extradite him to Sweden for questioning over sexual assault charges.
