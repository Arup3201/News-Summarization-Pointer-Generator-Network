A street performer accused of 'annoying' shoppers by addressing them on the meaning on life with a megaphone is fighting a council fine for noise nuisance because 'it is his human right'.

Danny Shine, 46, repeatedly used the loudhailer to warn members of the public in London's Oxford Circus shopping district about the perils of consumerism in November last year.

But a council warden confiscated his megaphone and Mr Shine was issued with a court summons for breaking a Westminster City Council bylaw for 'the prevention and suppression of nuisances'.

Mr Shine has decided to fight the case at Westminster Magistrates Court next month, claiming the law infringes on his human right to 'freedom of expression', and faces a fine of up to £500 if he is found guilty.

'Noise nuisance': Danny Shine, 46, has been accused of breaching a council bylaw by 'annoying' shoppers in London's Oxford Street by addressing them with a megaphone

As well as fighting his own case, Mr 
Shine, from Hendon, North London, hopes to have the 12-year-old bylaw 
declared unlawful by the court for conflicting with the Human Rights Act. 

Mr Shine has been expressing his views with his megaphone on the streets of London for the past four years and videos of his antics have been viewed more than two million times on YouTube.

Mr Shine told The Independent: 'This law is completely arbitrary. It allows a member of the public or a civilian officer to prosecute you because you've annoyed him.

'While corporations are allowed to drown us in their messages, I’m not allowed to do what I think of as interactive street theatre. I end up with a summons and a choice of accepting a fine or fighting a case and ending with a legal bill of £10,000. This is shutting down freedom of expression.'

But the council says it is not prosecuting Mr Shine over the content of his speeches - just for the level of volume he delivers them at, which was causing a noise nuisance for shoppers and local businesses.

A Westminster City Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'This case isn’t about what you say in public – it’s about the volume at which you say it. The right to free speech isn’t a licence to walk the streets with a loudhailer disturbing the public.

'It’s our job as a local authority to protect the interests of the public and visitors to Westminster from undue noise and irritation.'

A council official added that Mr Shine was initially given the opportunity to sign a written undertaking that he would stop using the loudhailer to resolve the matter.

When Mr Shine refused, he was asked to accept a caution. When he also refused to take a caution, court action was taken as a last resort, the official said.

The 'Good Rule and Government' bylaw was drawn up in 2001 to stop people from making 'any noise which is so loud or so continuous or repeated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to other persons'.

The council said it has only used the law twice under extreme circumstances in the last year.

The case is due at Westminster Magistrates in September.

Last resort: A Westminster City Council official said court action against Mr Shine was a last resort after he refused several requests to stop using a megaphone. The Council claims that the issue was not the content of Mr Shine's speeches - just the loud volume he performed them at, which created a noise nuisance
