'Low': Cocaine addict Naseer Laher, pictured, mugged the girl for pocket money in the outrageous attack

A cocaine addict mugged an eight-year-old girl  for just £3.50 as she walked to the shop to buy sweets.

Naseer Laher, 31, was jailed for four years and three months after a court heard how he cornered Chelsea Dixon in an alleyway  in Batley Carr, West Yorkshire.

A judge told him: 'It doesn’t get much lower than that' as he sentenced the criminal yesterday.

Chelsea had only a few coins with her, enough to buy sweets from the post office and send letters she had written to her brother Lewis, who was serving in Afghanistan.

Her purse had belonged to her beloved grandmother, who had died four weeks before she was attacked on March 15, Leeds Crown Court heard.

Laher, of Batley, approached her about 4.30pm and asked how much money she had, according to prosecutor Shamaila Quereshi.

She told him she did not have any, but he grabbed the purse and hurt her wrist during the struggle.

A witness saw Laher run away after the attack and went to help the youngster, who was deeply distressed.

Laher was arrested and denied the offence, claiming he had been 
appearing in court at the time. Chelsea later picked him out at an identity parade.

At the time of the offence, Laher, who pleaded guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing, was already subject to a community order imposed after he burgled the home of one of his relatives.

Ms Quereshi said Chelsea’s purse has never been recovered and the little girl was crushed, because she had been very close to her grandmother.

She is now afraid to be on her own, the court heard, and is scared to return to the post office.

Chelsea’s mother, Amanda Dixon, described her daughter in a statement as being 'very brave' in helping the police and identifying her attacker.

Judge Christopher Batty told Laher: 'No doubt she was hugely proud of the fact that she had the purse of her grandmother, who had died only a month before.

'Little did she know she was going to encounter you, a cocaine addict for many years.'

He added: 'She was easy prey to feed your addiction.'

After the hearing, Det Con Paul Greatorex, of Kirklees CID, said: 'It is hard to understand what would compel a grown man to rob a child for such a small amount of money.'

After the incident in March, Chelsea’s mother said: 'She just came running home, she was a mess.

'That night she wanted to sleep with me and she didn’t go to school the next day.'

Miss Dixon, said at the time that her daughter had been ‘distraught’ after the purse was snatched. 'It is all the more painful because of the sentimental value attached to it,' she added.
