Prince Philip was sporting a badly-bruised eye at a reception to commemorate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta at Buckingham Palace this evening. 

The 93-year-old Duke of Edinburgh was also wearing two butterfly stitches on a cut to his right ear that he received during his Christmas Break in Sandringham last month.  

Buckingham Palace do not comment on the health of the royal family but played down Philip's new facial injury by saying that he was: 'Well enough to attend the event this evening.'

The Duke of Edinburgh had some painful-looking bruising to his eye at an event at Buckingham Palace this evening to commemorate the Magna Carta. He also had two butterfly stitches on a cut that he had sustained a couple of weeks earlier while on his Christmas break in Sandringham

It isn't the first time that the Duke has sported a black eye in recent years - in April 2013, he carried a similar mark under the same eye during an official engagement in Canada. 

At the time, it was reported that he hadn't fallen and had simply woken up with the mark on his face. 

The Duke was at the event this evening to accompany The Queen in her capacity as Patron of the Magna Carta Trust. 

Several Members of Parliament, constitutional historians, representatives of non-governmental organisations, and senior figures from the legal profession attended the reception at the palace  to celebrate 800 years since the Magna Carta was sealed in 1215.

The Queen wore a bright red dress with a matching jacket and accessorised with a diamond brooch, a pair of pearl earrings and a pearl necklace. 

During the event, guests were given the opportunity to view a facsimile of Magna Carta, provided by the British Library. 

King John agreed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history.

Meaning 'The Great Charter', the Magna Carta brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law and had the right to fair trial.

The manuscript has a large influence on the rule of law in Britain today, giving all citizens the right to justice and a fair trial.

It says: 'No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. 

'To no-one will we sell, to no-one deny or delay right or justice.'

Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived.

The Magna Carta influenced  Thomas Jefferson when he helped draft the Declaration of Independence. 

It also influenced the writers of the French constitution and the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, who cited it in his famous speech in his own defence at the Rivonia trial in 1964.

What is Magna Carta?

Magna Carta is an 800-year-old document containing the idea that no-one is above the law, and it still forms the foundation of many modern ideas and documents today.

What does Magna Carta mean?

It means 'Great Charter' in Latin. In fact the whole document is in Latin.

When and where was Magna Carta granted?

Magna Carta was first drawn up in 1215, granted by King John on June 15 at Runnymede near the River Thames in Surrey.

Why was Magna Carta first written and granted?

It was originally meant as a peace treaty between King John and his barons, with whom he was at war.

Is it true that King John never 'signed' Magna Carta?

Yes, at least not in the way we think of signing. Back in the Middle Ages kings never signed their name on documents to pass them into law. Instead John used his Great Seal to authenticate the document.

How much of Magna Carta is relevant today?

The original Magna Carta had 63 clauses. Today, only three of the original 63 clauses remain on the statute books.

Of these three survivors one defends the liberties and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns, and the third gives all English subjects the right to justice and a fair trial.
