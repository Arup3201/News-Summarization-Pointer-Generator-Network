Rachel Kenehan, 35, from London, arrives at Winchester Crown Court where she is on trial alongside three others who are charged with murder and conspiracy to supply

A PhD student who studied criminology used her in-depth knowledge of crime to help her boyfriend run a heroin and crack cocaine ring, months before he and his friends murdered a rival, a court has heard.

Rachel Kenehan, 35, of Hewlett Road, London, was in a relationship with one of the men accused of shooting Jahmel Jones in the head in Southampton in 2012.

She met her boyfriend Pierre Lewis through a prison mentoring scheme, Winchester Crown Court heard.

Kenehan, who also has a Masters degree in sociology, was charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs, assisting an offender and perverting the course of justice.

She was said to have used her academic career at London School of Economics to assist Lewis and his friends deal drugs.

Kenehan's boyfriend, Pierre Lewis, 20, and his friends Jemmikai Orlebar-Forbes, 22 and Isaac Boateng, 22 are accused of the murder of Jahmel Jones, 23, also known as Lucky, after he was shot in the head in Southampton in 2012.

The jury heard Kenehan had 'an in-depth knowledge of criminal behavior and the frailty of human nature' that she had gained from the studies that she used to aid the crimes.

According to prosecutor Ian Lawrie QC she played a 'robust, direct and calculating role' in the conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine, spending thousands hiring cars and making trips on the M3 between London and Southampton.

Sometimes she would cover hundreds of miles in a day in her alleged attempts to aid the drug ring that spanned a length of the country.

Other times, one hire car would be dropped off and another one picked up ten minutes later, and these cars were frequently caught by speed cameras.

Every time one of the cars was caught, Kenehan would take the blame, but the pictures showed a black man was behind the wheel.

Kenehan and Lewis met when she was volunteering for a charity that put young men with mentors to stop them from breaking the law, and they soon developed a relationship.

Lawrie said: 'How is it that this young lady, with all her ability and intelligence, gets involved in class A drugs?

'It’s a short stop beyond that to assist the man she’s in a relationship with.

'rather ironically, because of her qualifications, she had an in-depth 
knowledge of crime, and that it was up to the jury to decide whether she
 was someone with a “misplaced attachment” or whether she had been 
actively involved.'

Mr Lawrie said the defendants had no family and no fixed address in Southampton but would often stay homes of drug users.

One of the flats they used was in a block called Graham House in St Mary Street, Southampton, also used by Jones.

The jury heard that shortly
 before his death, Jones and the defendants were spotted several 
times on CCTV cameras walking up and down St Mary Street.

Jahmel Jones, 20, was shot in the head in Southampton in 2012

Jones
 ended up asking one of his customers for help and telling them he was 
in some sort of trouble.

Jones and the customer entered flat four in Graham house where 
Orlebar-Forbes allegedly raised his arm, with a revolver in his hand, and fired 
two shots.

One hit Mr Jones in the head and the other in the right arm, causing him to fall to the floor, and Lewis's palm print was later found on a wall above where Jones had collapsed.

The court heard that the
 defendants were then seen leaving the building through a back door before 
briefly returning to collect their belongings from a friend's home and by 11.31am they were in a taxi to 
another friend's home in Basingstoke where they were later picked up by 
Kenehan.

Orlebar-Forbes was seen rubbing the 
taxi's sun visor and rear doors with his sleeve, before they all 
changed their phone numbers later that day.

Mr Lawrie said there had been regular contact between Lewis and Kenehan which 'spurred her to go to Basingstoke to rescue them, and that according to texts between Lewis and Kenehan that day, she must have known what  happened that morning.

One text from Kenehan to Lewis said: 'Do not disappear, that will look weird. I want your baby.'

Another said: 'Promise we can get through this. Be smart, act normal. We'll talk. I wish you had got your passport.'

And a third message talked about them sunning themselves, semi-naked in Brazil.

Mr
 Lawrie said: 'This behaviour and these actions are an echo of her 
desire for the man she presumably loves as she wants his baby.

'The allegation we make is that she is clearly assisting all three defendants.'

Kenehan denies all charges, while Lewis, of Castlenau, Barnes, London, Orlebar-Forbes, of Cloudesdale 
Road, London, and Boateng, of Mill Farm Crescent, Hounslow, London, all 
deny murder but have pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to 
supply heroin and crack cocaine.

The trial continues.
