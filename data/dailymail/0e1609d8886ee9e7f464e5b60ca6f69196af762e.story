On the outside, this mother-of-five seems like a beautiful, confident woman, but beneath her clothes is a hidden secret that's tormented her for over a decade.

Pam's unsightly varicose veins, which she describes as 'worms beneath my skin', crushed her confidence and gave her crippling insecurities, which meant she couldn't even undress in front of her own husband.

Tonight, on My Naked Secret, a documentary on TLC, Pam bravely unveils her unsightly legs and undergoes drastic treatment to rid her of her decade-long burden.

'I could never love my body as it is now,' she says as she shows her legs for the first time. 'But other people don't know what I'm hiding underneath my clothes.'

'It stops me doing activities with children and I feel I don't look good enough for my husband.

'I'm so tired of hiding. If I have to hide anymore I'm going to completely shut down.

'When I look in the mirror I feel really upset,' she admits on the documentary. 'My clothes are a safety net. I feel off guard when I take my clothes off.

'My problem is on my right leg - I've got really bad varicose veins,' she says bravely unveiling them. 'They start on the top of my thigh and finish at the top of my feet. It's really hard to look at myself in the mirror because my leg doesn't look normal.

'It feels like I've got worms in my leg,' she says referring to the wiggly protrusions that run along the back of her calf and thigh.

'It's like they've taken over my life - they've taken over my body' she says.

Varicose veins affects over 30% of adults and are more common in women. Pregnancy, weight gain, old age and a family history also increase their likelihood.

The unsightly and often painful condition develops when valves in the veins stop working properly causing blood to pool in the veins, which can make them swell and enlarge.

'They bulge out, they feel painful, they feel itchy and they feel like they are tearing up my skin,' says Pam. 'I'd feel very embarrassed if anyone saw them - they'd think I'm not normal. 

'I know that myself but hearing it from other people would be worse,' she says fighting back tears. 'I just want a normal leg. I just want to be normal like everyone else.'

Pam has always taken pride in her appearance so she was devastated when at aged 27 unsightly blue and purple bulges started to appear.

'They started after I had my third child, then after my fourth they became more visible. After my fifth, my leg looked gross.

'I went to the doctor who diagnosed varicose veins and gave me stockings and ibuprofen gel, but it didn't work.

'I dress around my problem by wearing long trousers and leggings,' says Pam.  'I wish I could wear a dress that would make me feel really confident in myself.'

'I rather there's no one in the room when I get changed and at night it's easier to just shut the lights off,' she continues.

Her self-esteem also has repercussions on her marriage. 'It affects my relationship with my husband. Although he won't say it I know he's probably thinking, "I wish I didn't have to feel those lumps on your leg."

'It makes me upset because for years I just wish that my leg was normal. I'm at that point I'm ready to try anything.'

On consultation with a surgeon, Pam find out she needs three different types of surgery, without which her veins could become a serious health hazard.

Consultant surgeon Professor Mark Whitely, explains, 'You have quite a strange pattern of veins. None of them are coming from the leg - they are all coming from the pelvis. If you don't remove them you could end up getting a leg ulcer and clots, which can lead to infection and in rare cases blood poisoning.

'Pam needs the veins in her pelvis removed then two different procedures to remove the veins in her legs - the laser threatment and then injections.'

Also on hand to help Pam restore her self-esteem is psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos. 'Pam has been hiding this issue for a decade. Is she going to take control - not just practically but emotionally too?' she questions.

Dr Papadopoulos gets Pam to open up about her past: 'I've got two sister and four brothers - I'm the oldest, which adds a lot of responsibility. I had to be a role model. I had to grow up quickly.'

'I had first child at 19, it was absolutely wonderful being mum - being a role model. I don't like to talk to close relatives because I'm afraid of their reaction.

Pam had to undergo a series of three treatments to rid herself of her veins

'I look after myself and want to look good for my husband - I feel ashamed.'

'It's as if you need to be perfect.' says Dr Papadopoulos. 'Let's focus on getting you to love all of you - letting go of your shame.'

'You're focusing on one thing. You think it's ugly but if you stop focusing you'll start being able to see yourself.'

Despite never having had surgery before Pam decides to go ahead with the drastic series of treatments. 

Dr Tony Lopez, performs Pam's pelvic coil embolisation. 'I have to access the faulty veins and close them off completely. The pelvic veins are accessed via Pam's neck, through her heart, abdomonial cavity and then into the pelvis. Metal coils are inserted so they no longer fill with blood.'

The procedure takes one hour and Pam goes home later that day. The surgery on her leg veins happens in two parts and involves two-hour sessions using local anesthetic .

The first procedure is endovenous lazer ablation and a phlebectomy where the veins are removed through incisions in the leg using a tiny hook.

Next Pam has foam schlerotherapy, where a special substance is injected into the veins, which forces the forces blood out of veins and kills them.

For two weeks Pam has to wear compression bandages and is told to expect the heeling process to take three months. But just seven weeks later, Pam is overwhelmed by the results of her series of treatments.

'Look at me!' she says twirling in a knee-length dress. 'I feel so much happier - I can wear dresses and skirts and not worry about how my legs look.

'I could never have worn something like this before. I'm just so impressed with the results. When I used to take my clothes off I used to be so uncomfortable looking at myself.

'Now I've got great looking legs I don't have pain and every opportunity I want to look in mirror!

'For ten years I've been trapped and now I can feel confidence wherever I am. I feel absolutely free.

'My relationship with my husband now is absolutely superb. He can see I'm happier person in myself and that makes him happy.

'I now look forward to the future and I'm feeling confident. It's a great feeling.'
