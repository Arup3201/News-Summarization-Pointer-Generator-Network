He is probably still a toddler.

But woe betide the first boy to ask out the two-year-old daughter of retired Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell.

Luttrell, the 'lone survivor', has compiled a list of challenges the young man will have to overcome before taking Addie on a date.

And it is no walk in the park.

Warning: Marcus Luttrell, pictured with his two-year-old daughter Addie, says boyfriends will have to impress

The 200-word lecture, posted on Facebook, reads: 'I’m gonna make him contact every father of a daughter on here, MMA fighter, boxer, police officer, fire fighter and let’s not forget the toughest of all Prison guards to get their blessing.

'Oh... in person by the way.'

He adds: 'Then he will have to do the same thing w/ all my teammates while they show him the team armory.

'Paint the house, mend some fence, cut the lawn, rope a tornado,bottle up a hurricane, and put out a Forrest fire w/ a squirt gun etc…'

Tough challenge: He posted an extensive list of obstacles for the boy in question to overcome

Growing up: Luttrell joked on Facebook that he'll have to give Addie 'the tattoo talk', posting this photo (left) 

And that's not it: 'He gets that done then I’ll let him have my cell number so they can face time while I hold the phone.'

Describing himself as a 6'5", 250lbs, tattooed maniac, Luttrell adds: 'Nothing to (sic) difficult. Look forward to seeing the first candidate in about 16 years I’ll be waiting.'

The post was shared more than 4,000 times in just a matter of hours. 

Luttrell told Fox News the rant was inspired by this year's movie 22 Jump Street, in which Ice Cube plays a raging protective father. 

Hero: Boys who want to date Addie will no doubt be intimidated by Luttrell's heroic life story

But he said he will be rational when the time comes: 'I'm a realist. i remember being 16 and 17 years old and what that felt like.

'And I have a 16-year-old stepson who has his homecoming tonight and he told me he's got a date. I said "hey that's great" but in the same breath: "you better treat her right". 

'The most important thing to me is that I hope she [his daughter] finds someone unconditionally and treats her well and loves her as much as I love her mother.'
