Loic Remy has played his last game for Newcastle United after not being included in the squad for Sunday’s trip to Liverpool.

It was suggested earlier in the day that the French forward had pulled out of the game and the club later said he had picked up a knock in training.

Top scorer: Loic Remy has bagged 14 goals for Newcastle this season but will not be back at the club next season

Out: Reny missed the final game of the season at Liverpool because of injury

Ambition: Remy wants to move to one of Europe's top clubs this summer

Remy’s season-long loan deal with the Magpies expires following the final-day clash against the Reds.

The Queens Park Rangers striker - who looks set to be included in the France squad for this summer’s World Cup - has already declared his intention to join a  ‘top European club’ ahead of next season.

Remy scored 14 goals for United during his season on Tyneside and has attracted interest from North London rivals Arsenal and Spurs.

Meanwhile, compatriot Hatem Ben Arfa was also absent from the Newcastle squad which travelled to Anfield as his first-team exile continued.
