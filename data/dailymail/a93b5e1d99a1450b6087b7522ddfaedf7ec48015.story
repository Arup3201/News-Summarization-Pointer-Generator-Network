An 'evil' policeman raped at least nine women to purposely infect them with HIV in a 10-year reign of terror, it is alleged.

Ephraim Izmailov, 36, who was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2001, began preying on his victims in 2005 in Kaliningrad, a city in western Russia, according to police. 

Cruising the streets late at night in his patrol car, Izmailov would allegedly stop women he spotted by themselves and offer them a lift home. 

Ephraim Izmailov accosted lone women, locked them in his car and then raped them to infect them with HIV

He would then reportedly ask if they wanted sex and when they refused he would lock them in his vehicle and raped them.

Over 10 years he 'deliberately and callously infected' at least nine victims, according to police.

Officers are building a case against Izmailov, who is in custody, and are asking for more potential victims to come forward. If convicted, he faces life in prison for his crimes.

A friend of one of the victims, Nikita Zaitseva, 29, said: 'My friend was walking home when he pulled over and asked her if she'd like a lift.

'He told her he was a policeman and even showed her his ID.

'Thinking that he was genuine and honest she got in and he then drove her to a deserted part of the city and raped her.

'He then dumped her on the ground and told her he had HIV and she now did too.

Ismailov would prowl the streets of the western Russian city of Kaliningrad in his car hunting for victims

'He is an evil, evil man.'

Izmailov was captured after one of his victims managed to remember his car number plate.

A police spokesman said: 'Over a 10-year period he raped and deliberately and callously infected his victims.

'He has shown no remorse whatsoever.

'We have had nine women come forward so far but we suspect there are many, many more.

'We are appealing for anyone who was attacked by this man to come forward.'

Kaliningrad is a port city which is part of the Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea
