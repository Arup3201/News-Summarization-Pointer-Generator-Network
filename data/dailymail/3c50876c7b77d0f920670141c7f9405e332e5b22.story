More than 3,300 security passes to gain access to heart of government have been lost since the coalition was formed, new figures reveal.

Ministers were accused of failing to grips with a threat to security after admitting the equivalent of nine passes is lost every day.

Embarrassingly a third of the passes were lost by officials at the Home Office – the department charged with protecting national security.

Pass out: New figures reveal how staff Whitehall departments have lost more than 3,300 security passes in the last three years

Guidance advising that staff are ‘to be vigilant with their passes and staff ID cards’ is now being reviewed in a bid to get a grip on the problem.

To date the message does not seem to be getting through, with just 12 departments admitting to losing 3,331 passes since May 2010.

Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow minister without portfolio, told MailOnline: ‘Since 2010, ministers have managed to allow over 3,000 security passes go missing under their watch - including more than 1,100 at the Home Office which is responsible for our national security.

‘And of course we don't know the full scale of the problem because some big government departments have refused to come clean - so much for transparency.

‘Every time a pass is lost or stolen, there is a potential security risk.   These bumbling ministers need to get a grip.’

The worst offender is the Department 
for Transport, where a total of 1,173 departmental identity cards or 
passes have been reported lost or stolen at the ministry and its 
quangos.

Transport minister Stephen Hammond 
said: ‘All staff are contractually required to look after identity cards
and passes. Guidance to staff is currently being reviewed.’

However the most worrying figures are at the Home Office, where 1,105 passes have been lost or stolen.

The ministry in charge of national 
security admitted the figure could be much higher, because it does not 
include passes which were later found.

Home Office minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The loss of any Government asset, which includes Home Office building passes and staff ID cards, is treated very seriously.

‘All staff must report the loss to their respective departmental security unit without delay.

‘Each loss is investigated and recorded. As soon as a loss is reported to security immediate measures are taken to de-activate the access control capability.

‘Departmental security personnel constantly remind staff to be vigilant with their passes and staff ID cards.’

The Department for Education admitted losing 261 passes, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 205, the Foreign Office 140 and the Treasury 128.

Staff at the Department for International Development lost 136 passes, Department of Health 68, Scotland Office 10, Wales Office 3 and Northern Ireland office two.

The total figure could be much higher because some departments refused to answer parliamentary questions tabled by Labour frontbencher Michael Dugher.
