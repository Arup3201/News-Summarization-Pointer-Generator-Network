It's intended to draw the attention of those who dream of one day achieving top Olympic honours.

However, a new women's T-shirt by Nike that is emblazoned with the words Gold Digging, has offended rather than inspired.

An official description for the T-shirt reads, 'We aren't saying they're gold diggers - we're just saying they're out for the gold! What's wrong with that?', suggesting that even the sporting giant itself is aware of the product's potential to be deemed sexist.

The company defended the design, telling MailOnline: 'Nike has consistently supported female athletes and the position they enjoy as positive role models. The T-shirt uses a phrase in an ironic way that is relevant given it was released just as the world focused on the success of female athletes'.

Offensive: A new women's T-shirt by Nike that is printed with the words Gold Digging has been deemed sexist rather than inspirational. People have taken to Twitter to express their disapproval over the product

Regardless, many people have taken to Twitter to express their disapproval over the shirt's slogan, which shimmers metallic gold and is placed above the brand's trademark tick logo.

One user posted on the social networking site: 'Lady Olympians are "gold diggers," @Nike? Disgusting. Seriously, who thought that pun was a good idea?'.

Another user wrote: 'Nike missed me with the Gold Digging shirts... #showsomeclass'.

The shirt retails for $24.99 on WorldSoccerShop.com.

Controversial: The brand's recent ad, which featured a 200lbs boy running, received negative feedback also

Positive: Nathan Sorrell, 12, (above) who appeared in the ad, was a fan of the ad and defended it on Today

A reader of the fashion site Styleite.com probably articulated their gripe with the product best.

The reader wrote: 'Unless a woman has an IQ under 80, or has not a shred of self respect, she is not buying that stupid t shirt'.

This is the second time in just one week that the sporting brand has sparked controversy.

Many viewers of a recent ad which showed a 200lbs boy running labelled it degrading.

The Lance Acord-directed piece that features 12-year-old Nathan Sorrell, is grueling to watch.

'Disgusting. Seriously, who thought that pun was a good idea?'

The boy chases the camera in the twilight for roughly a minute, the sound of his heavy footsteps echoing on the weathered road.

But while Nathan ran so much that he threw up while shooting the 
commercial, he found the experience inspirational and he and his mother 
have vowed to change their lives and their diets.

And despite the criticism, the Find Your Greatness ad, which is viewable on YouTube, attracted praise as well and more than 1million views.

The London, Ohio boy said on the Today show that haters have inspired him to get fit even more.

He told Matt Lauer: 'Iâ€™m starting to learn, even if somebody
completely physically fit did that commercial, they would still get, as
they say, haters.'
