Amir Khan may not know the name of his next opponent, but he intends to look good whoever he meets in the ring. 

The Bolton welterweight plans to fight in May after missing out on facing either Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao, who look set to finally tackle each other in a £200million Las Vegas mega-fight. 

And Khan paid a visit to Fight Label in Sheffield on Thursday, the company responsible for the £30,000 shorts he wore for his victory over Devon Alexander last December.

Laced with 24-carat gold thread, the shorts were later donated to the Peshawar school in Pakistan where 132 children were killed by Taliban gunmen. 

And while his next pair will be considerably less extravagant, Khan was shown several luxurious samples, including snakeskin, by designer Sophie Whittam. 

'We looked at a few different designs for my next fight,' he told Sportsmail. 'I like to wear kit that will make me feel good when I go into a fight, that way I fight better. I want to look slick. 

'I like the gold colour; they showed me different leathers, python leather and a few different colours. It depends where the fight is going to be. We're looking at Vegas and New York, so when we find that out I'll let Sophie know and she'll put the kit together.

Khan also took time out to speak to the media in Sheffield on Thursday

'It's very important because people talk about how good you look. It makes you fight better and feel good when you're in the ring. 

One thing about my team, even with the tracksuits, is that we look very organised with the same kit each day. 

'A lot of people wondered why I made such expensive shorts but in the back of mind I always wanted to give it to charity. I donated my shorts to the school so they can rebuild it and improve on security.'
