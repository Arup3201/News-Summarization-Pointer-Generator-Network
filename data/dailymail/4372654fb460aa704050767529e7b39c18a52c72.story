Condemned: John Cherry, a former Conservative councillor for Chichester District Council

A Tory councillor was forced to resign last night after suggesting inner-city children from a ‘coloured area’ would not be welcome at a proposed new school in the countryside.

John Cherry, 73, said the youngsters could ‘escape into the forest’ and trigger a ‘sexual volcano’ because they had been ‘plucked from their natural surroundings’.

Announcing his resignation last night, he said: ‘My remarks were plainly wrong. They were thoughtless and extremely foolish. I unreservedly apologise and withdraw them. I very much regret the distress this must have caused.’

Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg called for David Cameron to condemn the comments. He said: ‘When a Tory councillor makes openly racist comments like these, it’s no  surprise people still think of the Conservatives as the nasty party.’

A Conservative Party spokesman said last night that the process had begun to suspend Mr Cherry, adding: ‘These comments are totally unacceptable.’

The high-performing state-run Durand Academy in Stockwell, South London, is planning to open a boarding school in an affluent rural area of West Sussex. It hopes to send 600 teenagers there every Monday morning for lessons and bring them back on Friday evenings free of charge, so they can enjoy an ‘Eton-style experience’ away from violent crime in their local area.

But there has been strong opposition from people living near the disused boarding school in the quiet village of Stedham, overlooking the South Downs. They fear a ‘tranquil place’ would be ruined by ‘bringing Brixton to the countryside’. One resident even claimed the students would be ‘searched daily for weapons’.

Education Secretary Michael Gove waded into the row, accusing those who oppose the plan of ‘trying to obstruct an inspirational project’, but it is Mr Cherry’s incendiary comments that have provoked the most anger.

He said: ‘Ninety-seven per cent of pupils will be black or Asian. If they’re Chinese, they’ll rise to the top. If they’re Indian, they’ll rise to the top. If they’re Pakistani, they won’t.

‘There are certain nationalities where hard work is highly valued. There are certain nationalities where they are uncertain what this hard work is all about.

‘If the children are not allowed out of the site then it will make them want to escape into the forest – it will be a sexual volcano.’

He added: ‘Stockwell is a coloured area – I have no problem with that.’

The row will be particularly uncomfortable for the Tories as it comes days after Mr Cameron was warned he must woo non-white voters to have any chance of winning the next election.

Lord Ashcroft, the pollster and former Tory donor, said the party won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the general election in 2010. In a hard-hitting critique, he said: ‘We must do better than this – both because we should be a party for the whole country, and because we will find it increasingly difficult to win a majority without them.’

Dozens of residents attended a public meeting in the affluent nearby village of Milland, where actor Hugh Bonneville has a home, to oppose the Durand development for a variety of reasons, including traffic and the size of the project.

But one unnamed resident said: ‘You must be wary about students who will have to be searched daily for weapons and knives.’

Mr Cherry has lived in the area for 40 years. He lives with his wife Priscilla a few hundred yards from Stedham.

Anne Reynolds, chairman of the Woolbeding with Redford parish council, says the plans are ‘ill conceived’, and  she fears the village will be left with a ‘white elephant’.

Shock: Durand Academy chief Greg Martin has described the attitude of residents as 'shocking' but has vowed to press on with the scheme

She added: ‘I can’t comment on what Councillor Cherry has said – we have had two public meetings and that has not been a view I have heard. But there is quite a lot of opposition – it’s a development the size of three superstores.

‘Where is the evidence that shows pupils’ attainment levels are improved by being in a rural environment? They would be better off building them a better school in Stockwell.’

Durand’s director of education, Greg Martin, said residents’ comments had been ‘shocking’ but he vowed to press ahead.

The school is rated as outstanding by Ofsted. The staff and governors used the proceeds from Durand’s leisure and student accommodation business to buy Grade II-listed Cuthman’s school for £3.4million in 2010.

Mr Martin added: ‘I’ve heard a few comments. It’s sad, but it makes us want to fight harder, and when this councillor sees the hard work and commitment from ethnic minorities, I’m sure he will change his tune. You will soon realise these are frankly nothing more than baseless prejudices.’
