A 20-year-old hairdresser from a New York suburb has two Good Samaritans to thank for pulling her to safety from the burning wreckage of her car following a horrific crash over the weekend.

Alyssa Fox was driving home to Seaford at around 2am Saturday when she veered off Route 347 in Smithtown and slammed into a tree. Her car immediately burst into flames.

As her parents later described in a touching letter addressed to her rescuers, their daughter was lying badly injured and disoriented inside a burning car flipped on its side when she heard a voice from the outside and saw a shadow.

Emotional reunion: Matthew Monahan, took a break from his duties as a nursing assistant in the ER at Stony Brook University Hospital on Tuesday, to visit 20-year-old Alyssa Fox, in the hospital room where she is recovering from her injuries from an accident last weekend

Hugs and tears: Fox tearfully said that if it were not for her two 'guardian angels,' she would have died in her car because she was too injured to escape on her own

Matthew Monahan, 25, a volunteer firefighter and nursing assistant at Stony Brook University Hospital, noticed the burning car and rushed over to see if he could help.

Joseph Moscato, a Long Island Rail Road engineer and former firefighter and paramedic, was also driving in the area after finishing his shift and pulled over.

Working together, the two complete strangers armed with a single fire extinguisher were able to tame the flames just long enough for Monahan to pull the severely injured Fox out of the managed vehicle.

Just 30 seconds later, the 2006 Dodge Sedan turned into a fireball.

The young hair stylist from Seaford suffered a broken spine, fractured several ribs, her clavicle, a leg and one of her wrists.

On Tuesday, Miss Fox, who has been undergoing treatment at Stony Brook University Hospital since Saturday, had a tearful reunion with the two men whom she now calls her 'guardian angels.'

'I just remember sitting in the car and screaming for my life, like, “You need to get me out of here!”' Fox recalled to CBS2 from her hospital bed. ‘He [Monahan] got there five seconds later. Literally, someone was watching over me.’

The bedridden young victim with a brace on her neck explained that on the night of the accident, she briefly glanced at her GPS, and a moment later her car struck a tree near Veterans Memorial Highway and caught fire.

Monahan, whose father is a 40-year veteran of the NYFD, reached the burning wreckage first and tried to break the windshield with his boots, but to no avail. He was soon joined by Moscato, whose dashboard camera recorded the pair's heroic efforts.

At first, the LIRR worker tried to 
use his fire extinguisher as a battering ram to crack the windshield. 
When that did not work, Moscato sprayed the intensifying flames, which 
by then had spread to the interior of the car, with foam from his handheld extinguisher.

His
 split-second decision bought Monahan enough time to grab Fox and 
extract her from the vehicle, which was consumed by the raging inferno 
just seconds later.

Laundry list of injuries: The blonde, 20-year-old hair stylist from Seaford suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, clavicle, a leg and one of her wrists

True gratitude: Fox and her family said they were eternally grateful to the woman's rescuers for putting their lives at risk in order to save her from certain death

‘There was a moment when I said to him I’m going to die tonight,’ Fox told WABC. ‘I’m not going to make it out. I’m going to die in here. He said, “I’m not leaving you behind. I’m getting you out of here.”’

Later, the young woman, who is now on a long road to recovery, called her rescue a ‘miracle’ and said that she would not be alive today without Moscato and Monahan.

Alyssa’s father, Scott Fox, celebrated his 50th birthday Tuesday, calling his daughter’s rescue the best present a parent could get.

‘These guys are heroes, they are part of my family without a doubt,’ he told the New York Post. ‘I don’t know how I could ever repay these guys. Without them, it’d be a totally different story.’

On his part, Monahan has dismissed the notion that he was a hero, insisting that he was just doing his job.

‘People talk about rewards and things like that,’ the humble firefighter told the station WABC. ‘My reward is to look her in her face and see her smile at the end of the day, that's my reward.’
