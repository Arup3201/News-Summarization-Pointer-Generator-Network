A former ballerina is being sued by her plastic surgeon for suggesting during a television interview that a boob job left her 'mutilated'.

Vica Blokina, 39, who lives in the Romanian capital Bucharest, complained about the silicon implants she was given by Adina Alberts two years ago, but did not seek legal action fearing it would prolong her ordeal. 

But Miss Albert has refuted the allegations and suggested the Lithuanian-born dancer did not follow medical advice, prompting her to start a case of her own.

In the tearful interview with a local starion the former ballerina is seen crying over the ordeal she had to go through in order to get the operation put right.

She said: 'She is very good in theory. She explained exactly what was going to happen. But she didn't put it into practice.'

Miss Alberts reacted by saying: 'Mutilation really does suggest 
something horrific like the fact that one of her breasts ended up 
completely missing. The fact is there was no mutilation.'

She added: 
'The only problems with her operation was that she didn't follow any of 
the medical advice. She failed to wear a bra, she went to the seaside 
even though we told her not to expose her breasts in sunlight, and nor 
did she come in within the prescribed 14 days to have the wires 
removed. 

'In
 fact it took 20 days. I know that she says she did everything she was 
supposed to do but we have evidence that proves this was not true.'

Before and after: Miss Blokina said the result of the operation (right) left her feeling mutilated

Miss Blokina has said she is in shock after discovering she was being sued for 450,000 euros (£350,000) over the interview.

'I can't believe it. I mean I am the one that was mutilated and I 
didn't take any legal action against her because I felt a long court 
process would mean I remained in this condition and things were put 
right. So I agreed to say nothing and now I am getting sued by her now 
that it's all fixed,' she said.

Miss Blokina became famous in Romania after she sued national
 football squad manager Victor Piturca to claim child support for their 
son.

Complainant: Miss Alberts claimed her patient ignored medical advice and did not wear a bra after the surgery
