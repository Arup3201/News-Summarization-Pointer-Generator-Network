Will Carling and Lewis Moody were among those questioning Wales' decision to keep George North on the pitch against England - despite the winger appearing to be knocked out twice.

North suffered two head injuries during Wales' 21-16 defeat at the Millennium Stadium in the opening match of the 2015 Six Nations on Friday night.

Moody, capped 71 times by England, posted on Twitter: 'Why was George North not taken off - terrible decision by the medics. Out cold.'

BBC commentator and former England international Brian Moore also commented: 'I think he (North) is definitely concussed. I am surprised he has been kept on the field.'

Wales coach Warren Gatland though was adamant all the correct medical procedures were followed.

After the game, he said: 'Didn't see second-one but George North passed all protocols first time. We'll have to see how he is over next few days.' 

In the first half, the 22-year-old Northampton Saints winger was inadvertently kicked in the face by England second row Dave Attwood.

Despite being given initial treatment and being temporarily replaced by wing Luke Williams for almost five minutes, North returned to the field.

His game greatly suffered, however, and he was then seemingly knocked out cold again in the second half.

This time, North was attempting to tackle England's Mike Brown with the help of his Wales team-mate Richard Hibbard - but the hooker accidentally smashed his head into the wing's nose.

North slumped to the ground, clearly not in control of his own body. 

He remained on the field for the entire match though, much to the disappointment of many ex-professionals onTwitter.

Moody added: 'Great win for a injury ravaged young england. Jonathan Joseph, George Ford were sublime. Disappointed with medics allowing North to continue.'

Former England skipper Carling also tweeted, saying: 'I really don't think George North should still be on the pitch. He looks very dazed.'

Meanwhile, former Scotland international Rory Lamont - who was capped 29 times by his country - tweeted: 'George North knocked out twice in one game and still on the pitch. How is this still happening?'
