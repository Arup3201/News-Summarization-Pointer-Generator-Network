From her outrageously tiny waist to 
her unfeasibly long legs, the world's most famous doll has long been the
 target of criticism from feminists and other women's groups who say it 
promotes an unhealthy idea of body image in girls.

Several artists have set about proving the public's claim by scaling the iconic doll up to human 
size, to reveal her unrealistic measurements 
compared to the average human girl.

But now, in a role reversal, one artist has shown what Barbie would look like as the average 19-year-old girl and the results are surprising.

Unhealthy Vs Healthy: Thanks to her ultra-slender measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a human, Barbie would be anorexic - here she is pictured next to a Lammily doll

Artist Nickolay Lamm of MyDeals.com used the measurements of an average 19-year-old woman to create a 3-D model,
 which he photographed next to a standard Barbie doll.

Lamm then 
photoshopped the 3-D model to make it look like a Barbie doll.

In his previous research, Lamm found that, scaled up to human size, Barbie 
dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the
 typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33.

The average woman, meanwhile, has 38 inch back, a 34 inch waist and hips that measure 40 inches around, and Lamm's work shows that Barbie looks a lot more natural with these measurements.

Comparison: Photos of a Barbie doll and the 3D printed model were taken and a Photoshop was applied to the 3D printed model to make it look like a Barbie doll

Thanks to her ultra-slender 
measurements, it has been estimated that, if she were to exist as a 
human, Barbie would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone, 8lbs - and would 
have a BMI of 16.24. This would fit the weight criteria for anorexia.

Speaking about his latest work, he said: 'My last Barbie project got a lot of criticism because Barbie is just a toy.

'People argue that a toy can't do any harm.

'However, if we criticise skinny models, we should at least be open to the possibility that Barbie may negatively influence young girls as well.

'Furthermore, a realistically proportioned Barbie actually looks pretty good in the pictures I produced.

'So, if there's even a small chance of Barbie in its present form negatively influencing girls, and if Barbie looks good as an average sized woman in America. What's stopping Mattel from making one?'

Role reversal: Whilst most artists have previously put Barbie's measurements onto a normal girl, Lamm did it the other way round

Fit to size: Barbie dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36-18-33, compared with the typical 19-year-old girl's 32-31-33

Negative: 'If there's even a small chance of Barbie in its present form negatively influencing girls, and if Barbie looks good as an average sized woman in America. What's stopping Mattel from making one?' asks Lamm

Nickolay Lamm is a 24 year old artist and researcher from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2011 from the College of Business Administration.

Speaking about his passion, he said: 'I always loved to draw and almost went to an art school instead of university. I combine art and research together to create compelling illustrations.

'Each blog post I make takes around 1-4 weeks to create. I feel very fortunate to make a living doing what I love to do.'
