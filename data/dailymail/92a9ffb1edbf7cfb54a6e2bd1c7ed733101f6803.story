Dustin Diamond, the actor who played Screech in the Nineties TV show Saved by the Bell, appeared in a Wisconsin courtroom on Monday.

Diamond, 37, is accused of stabbing a man during a bar fight on Christmas Day in Port Washington, Wisconsin, where he currently lives. 

He appeared in court on Monday afternoon alongside his 27-year-old fiancée, Amanda Schutz, around 30 minutes after him bailing himself out of jail.

A criminal complaint charges Diamond with second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon.

The hearing took place on Monday afternoon in Ozaukee County Circuit Court.

The criminal complaint said Diamond and his fiancee got into a tussle with two men and a woman at the Grand Avenue Saloon on Thursday night.

Diamond told police he accidentally stabbed one of the men while trying to defend his fiancee. 

The man was not seriously injured. Police say officers recovered a switchblade.

The actor's attorney told Fox: 'Dustin Diamond believes in the legal system. He's glad to be out of jail and looks forward to resolving this.'
