A baronet has won a legal battle with his own son over the sale of their £2.5million 13th century ancestral home.

Philip Howard, 50, had claimed he was entitled to £1.5million from the sale of Corby Castle,  which had been in the family since 1611.

Mr Howard's father Sir John Howard-Lawson sold the Cumbrian castle in 1994 for £2.5million, along with its contents and a thousand acres of land.

Mr Howard claimed his father had no right to sell the property, originally built as a peel tower in the 13th century, as he had failed to comply with the terms of a will made in 1934.

Philip Canning Howard, his great-great-grandfather, had dictated that in order to inherit Corby Castle, his heirs must change their surname to Howard and take up the family coat of arms within 12 months.

Mr Howard claimed Sir John had failed to do this, so never validly inherited Corby Castle and should not have benefited from its sale.

Lady Justice Proudman ruled in the High Court last year that Sir John had validly inherited the property.

Yesterday
 her decision was upheld by Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Richards 
and Lord Justice Patten sitting in the Court of Appeal, who awarded Sir John £22,000 costs.

Mr
 Howard, a business consultant, claimed his father, 77, whose original 
surname was Lawson, had 'forfeited' his right to inherit the castle in 
1961 by neglecting the terms of the will.

But Sir John, who represented himself, insisted he had begun to use the name before the end of January 1962.

The
 baronet also claimed the family was forced to sell Corby Castle when 
Philip Howard got into financial difficulties after taking on a major 
part of the estate.

However, the case is not over as Mr Howard has applied to take it to the Supreme Court.

Corby Castle is reputed to be haunted 
by a ghost known as The Radiant Boy, an apparition of a boy wearing 
white with shining golden hair.

Legend has it that any member of the 
Howard family who sees the ghost will rise to a position of great power,
 but will suffer a terrible death.

The castle, six miles from Carlisle
 on the east bank of the River Eden, dates from the 13th century and was
 built as a tower house by the Salkeld Family.

It was sold in 1611 to Lord William 
Howard, the third son of Thomas Howard, the 4th Duke of Norfolk, who 
added a two-storey L-shaped house to the original peel tower.

The present façade was built for Henry Howard between 1812 and 1817.

In 1981 the castle appeared in a BBC dramatisation of Wilkie Collins' The Woman 
in White, starring Diana Quick.

Lady Justice Arden said as she handed down her judgment that it was a 'very sad case' as the father and son had fallen out in a 'very bitter dispute'.

The three judges agreed Mr Howard was trying to recover what he thought was his 'rightful inheritance' but that Sir John had 'sufficiently complied' with the terms of the will.

They awarded £22,858 costs against Mr Howard.

The Howard family have previously been embroiled in a royal scandal, when, in 1572, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, was beheaded for treason after scheming to marry Mary Queen of Scots.

His third son, William, bought Corby Castle in Cumbria, in 1611, and for nearly four centuries it passed down through ten generations, reaching Sir John in 1961.

The Howard and Lawson families were combined when Corby Castle passed to Philip Canning Howard's sole heir, his daughter Ursula.

She married Sir John's grandfather, Sir Henry, the third baronet in 1899.

It was bought in 1994 by Northern Irish businessman, Edward Haughey, Lord Ballyedmond, who uses it for corporate events and shooting parties.
