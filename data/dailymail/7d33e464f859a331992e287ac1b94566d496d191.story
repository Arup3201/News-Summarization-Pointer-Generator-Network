If you started the new year with all good intentions to lose weight, but have started flagging, let your smartphone shame you into shedding the pounds.

Carrot Fit is the latest ‘sadistic’ app from Pennsylvania developer Brian Mueller designed to 'threaten, intimidate and ridicule' users into losing weight.

Users input their weight on a daily basis, and receive judgement from the ‘Carrot overlord’, yet equally, if they lose weight, Carrot will offer encouragement.

Scientists in Southampton have developed a 'smart bra' which can measure the wearer’s mood.

The bra is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity.

Researchers claim that by monitoring emotions, the bra can help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss.

Not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food, but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse.

As well as encouragement, people who lose weight will also be given rewards such as workout tips and advice.

According to the app description: 'Carrot is a sadistic AI construct with one simple goal: to transform your flabby carcass into a Grade A specimen of the human race.

'She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen. You will lose weight - or else.'

As a user tracks their weight, Carrot Fit will  monitor their BMI and update them on their progress.

All weight loss is tracked on a graph that can be shared with friends and at each weigh-in, Carrot will let the user know how much they've lost and the difference compared to the previous weigh-in.

Users can set goal weights, share their progress with friends and set reminder to weigh themselves.

Mueller said he didn’t create Carrot Fit to make people feel bad, instead he wanted to make 'weight loss entertaining and funny.'

The app costs £1.49 ($1.99 on the U.S. store) and future updates will include features described as ‘Deathmarch 5K’ and the ‘6-Minute Workout.’

Elsewhere, Mueller plans to add a calorie counter and Carrot Fit could one day be used with smartscales, connected via Wi-Fi.

An Android app is in development, but Mueller does not have a release date. 

Mueller has previously created similar apps, called Carrot To-Do and Carrot Alarm, that both use an avatar to encourage users to be more productive, or active.
