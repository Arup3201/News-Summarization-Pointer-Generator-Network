Rachael Ray's brother has defended the TV chef after she missed the funeral of her aunt who tragically died over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Ray was criticized by her own cousin for skipping the upstate New York funeral of Geraldine Scuderi, 77, because it clashed with prior filming commitments in New York City.

But her brother Emmanuel 'Manny' Ray said he was sad his sister's name was being dragged through the mud, claiming she 'works very hard' for herself but also to benefit others, including Scuderi's family.

Speaking to RadarOnline at Scuderi's wake and funeral in Ticonderoga last week, Manny said no one at the funeral was upset his famous sister didn't attend the ceremonies because she had to work.

'It's sad that Rachael's getting dragged into this when she really has nothing to do with it,' he told the website.

'She works very hard, and not only does she work for herself, but everyone she cares about. The people that work for her, the people around her, including (Geraldine's) family. She's been very good to them and I'm sorry they've decided to degrade it for this.'

Manny and Rachael's cousin and Scuderi's daughter, Gina Mesnick, told the National Enquirer she blamed the Ray family for her mother's death.

She also said she doubted Rachael had 'shed a single tear' over the tragedy.

Manny described the family situation 
as 'touchy,' and told Radar, 'I know that Gina is the one who kind of 
sparked this whole thing. It's upsetting.'

He said other relatives actually apologized for Mesnick's behavior and the public backlash it has caused at the funeral.

However, he insisted the family was still tight and would pull through the negative attention.

'We love them dearly, and this is just one of those things that families go through,' he said.

Scuderi sadly collapsed and died in the freezing cold when she became locked out of the chef's mother's home over the Thanksgiving holiday.

The 
77-year-old was house-sitting for Ray's mother Elsa Scuderi when she 
locked herself out of the house in upstate New York on November 29 as 
temperatures dipped to 9F.

Around
4 p.m., the woman reportedly went outside to feed the birds but could 
not get back into the home, despite desperately trying to break a 
window. She died of a heart attack, according to an autopsy report.

Mesnick later told National Enquirer: 'My mother is dead today because the Ray family neglected her.'

Speaking of her mother's death, she added: 'At some point in the evening, I suspect that, because of her (chronic lung problems), she had trouble breathing and collapsed in the driveway and basically died there. Her body wasn't found until the following morning.'

The Enquirer claims the aunt, who had a history of heart problems, had not been left a key to get back into the home.

Mesnick told the magazine that her mother was not given a key while house-sitting five days a week - for which she was paid $300 - but had to share with another house-sitter.

Neighbors close to the property were home at the time but it appears that the elderly woman was unable to make it the short distance for help. Scuderi's body was found the day after she died.

Ray along with her producer husband John Cusimano missed her aunt's funeral on December 5 due to work commitments.

The Warren County sheriff's office confirmed to MailOnline Wednesday that Scuderi died of natural causes and there was no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.  Lt. Steven Stockdale said there was no investigation into Scuderi's death.

A representative for Rachael Ray told MailOnline Wednesday: 'Unfortunately, the day of Rachael's aunt's funeral coincided with the final day of taping for the 2013 season of her daytime talk show.

'Her tape schedule could not be rescheduled partly because Rachael was committed to a live television broadcast on December 6 followed by a cross country book tour.

'Rachael has payed her respects privately and will spend more time with her family when she returns home.'
