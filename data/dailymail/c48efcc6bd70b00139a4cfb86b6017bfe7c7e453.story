Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is not just a pretty face, although she is certainly that. She is also, it would seem, a total whizz with pants. 

Her vintage-inspired collection for M&S, launched in August 2012, quickly went on to become the store's bestselling lingerie line - ever.

And now, as Devon-born Rosie releases her latest collection accompanied by a series of to-die-for shots of the lingerie modelled by RHW herself, that success shows no sign of abating.

Hands on: Rosie works closely with Marks & Spencer's lingerie designer Soozie Jenkinson to create the collections

This spring collection, all rosebud prints and soft shell-pink lace, is released just in time for Valentine's Day.

There
 are the usual romantic touches we have come to expect from Rosie for Autograph: pretty  flourishes and finishes inspired by Rosie's own 
collection of vintage lingerie, or by the many thousands of sets of 
underwear she has modelled during her career.

‘I send a lot of photographs of inspirations, I pick up things from flea markets and vintage fairs,’ she has said of the design process, a close collaboration with Marks & Spencer's Head of Lingerie Design Soozie Jenkinson and her team.

 it: Rosie posted this photo of herself modelling the latest collection

Vintage: Rosie has said some of her designs are inspired by her own lingerie collection

‘I like to try everything on before it goes to production to really feel the products, see how they sit on the body, make sure that I want to wear them and really understand the cuts and fabrics,' she explains.

'We wanted to create a luxurious collection of lingerie that would be perfect for Valentine’s Day and embraces a woman’s femininity making her feel utterly beautiful, whether she is treating herself or receiving a gift from her partner.'

Rosie says her favourite piece is the Amethyst Silk Plunge Bra and Brief set, which she says is the 'signature style' from her collection in a 'beautiful and flattering jewel colour.'

Soozie Jenkinson adds: 'Rosie and I put romance at the very heart of this collection, taking inspiration from the decadence and faded beauty of Rococo art and the decadent spirit of Versailles.

'The collection was designed with femininity in mind, and features sumptuous silks with French designed lace and new ultra light silk chiffon pieces which exude femininity.

Despite admitting she is inspired by other designers, there is no doubt
 that Rosie's collections, which she says 'exude feminine glamour' and feel 'exquisite' to wear have developed their very own flavour.

Soft-focus
 and sexy, whimsical and dreamy - yet, remember this is Marks & 
Spencer's bestselling lingerie range of all time - eminently wearable 
too. 

Simply put, the 
M&S shopper is not a fool. They will buy the £12.50 knickers and £25 bras not because a celebrity 
tells them to, but because they genuinely like them.

And that, as well as those coltish limbs, that hair, and those beautiful pictures, is the secret to Rosie's success.

Because yes, we all want to look like Rosie. But even more than that? We want to wear comfortable pants.

Success: Rosie's collection has proved to be the best selling of all of the designer collections at Marks & Spencer

Elegant: Rosie says she likes her lingerie to be sensual - something the wearer won't mind showing off

Romantic: There is a sensual touch running through all of Rosie's designs - yet they are eminently wearable too
