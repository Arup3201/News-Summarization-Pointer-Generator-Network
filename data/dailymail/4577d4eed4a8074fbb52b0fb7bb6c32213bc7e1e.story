Arsenal are awaiting clarification regarding Petr Cech's future before moving for the Chelsea goalkeeper.

The Czech Republic international is set to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the club now prepared to part with the keeper - but only for £10million or above.

Given Arsenal and Chelsea's rivalry, a move to the Emirates Stadium for Cech would be hard to broker.

Petr Cech, in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week, is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer 

Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has started only four Premier League games this season 

And the Gunners want to ensure they have a realistic chance of landing Cech before launching a move, with Chelsea likely to be reluctant to sell to a direct rival.

Cech revealed last week that he does not want to spend another season as understudy to first-choice keeper Thiabut Courtois at Stamford Bridge. 

The 32-year-old Czech Republic international has lost his place to the young Belgian this term, starting only four Premier League games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions.

'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo,' Cech said. 'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this.'

Cech joined Chelsea in 2004 and has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Champions League and three League Cups, the last of which was this season when he stared ahead of Courtios for the 2-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley.

'There always will be speculation, I leave it for the summer,' added Cech. 'It will be important to sit down with the club, with the manager, to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.'
