The Pope is so popular these days that now he even has his own magazine.

Called Il Mio Papa - or My Pope - the glossy magazine will each Wednesday include a free pull-out poster with one of Francis' more memorable quotes from the previous seven days.

It is not the first time that the Pope has donned the front cover of a magazine, having recently featured in Rolling Stone and Time magazine.

Man of the moment: So popular is the new Pope that a new weekly magazine devoted to him has been launched costing 41 pence an issue

The Mondadori publishing house, which lists the popular celebrity gossip rag Chi among its titles, is the publisher behind the new launch entirely devoted to the weekly doings, sayings, gestures and activities of the 265th Successor of Peter.  

Mondadori is part of ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi's media empire and is headed by his daughter, Marina Berlusconi.

It is being priced at 41 pence and confirms just how popular the new Pope has become. 

Editor Aldo Vitali said Pope Francis' election a year ago has generated new interest in the papacy, and moral and ethical themes that will be highlighted in the publication.

And as part of the Pope's new campaign to make the Catholic church more accessible officials have also announced that the lavish gardens of Castel Gandolfo, the refuge of popes since the 16th century, will from next week to be open to all.

Vatican museum director Antonio Paolucci said: 'It took a man like Francis to open the grounds to all.'

The gardens are a place ‘where the splendour of art and the glory of nature combine in an admirable balance,’ he added.

The sumptuous property covers 55 hectares (135 acres), a greater area that the Vatican City itself, and another world from the humble priests’ guestroom occupied by Francis in the Holy See. The Pope never moved into the grand papal apartments claiming they were too large for him.

The castle boasts breathtaking views over Lake Gandolfo, real name Lago Albano, as well as ornamental gardens, its own vegetable garden and a flock of chickens.

The villa and gardens have been owned by the Holy See since 1596, and are traditionally the refuge of the popes from the summer heat in the city. During his reign, Pope John Paul II ordered that a spectacular pool be put in.

Last summer the gardens stood empty as Francis refused to take holiday. After a trip to Brazil for World Youth Day the Pope had remained largely in Rome to the disappointment of villagers looking forward to welcoming him.

The visit may be out of reach for many pilgrims, however, with guided tours costing €26.

Pope
 Francis has quickly become one of the most admired Catholic church 
leaders in both religious and secular communities.

Last week after preaching peace, acceptance and 
inclusion of all faiths and sexual preferences, it is no surprise that 
Pope Francis found himself a mini-me.

The pontiff kissed the child, dressed up as a little pope, as he drove through the crowd at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican.

Unfortunately, 19-month-old Daniele De Sanctis was less pleased to see the pope, and begun to cry in the strange man’s arms.
