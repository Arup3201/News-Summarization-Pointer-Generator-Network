A teenager was left fighting for her life after drinking a cocktail in a Bali bar that contained methanol.

Jasmine Baker, 17, from Australia’s Empire Bay, had travelled to the Indonesian island with friends.

On Thursday she was the designated sober member of the party when they went to the Bounty nightclub.

Lucky to be alive: Jasmine Baker, 17, was left fighting for her life after drinking a cocktail in a Bali bar that contained methanol

However, after just one cocktail she became seriously unwell and was airlifted to a Darwin hospital.

Although results of the tests on the drink she consumed are yet to be completed, it’s thought that Jasmine suffered from methanol poisoning.

The body cannot process methanol and it’s so toxic that just 30ml is enough to kill a human and even 10ml can render someone blind.

Jasmine spent the weekend in hospital and has now been released, to the relief of her parents, Eileen and Errol.

Eileen wrote on Facebook: ‘Jasmine is doing very well. She has been one lucky girl.’

Errol, meanwhile, warned all youngsters to be careful when in Bali.

Hot spot: Bali is a popular holiday destination for Australians

He wrote online: ‘If you feel sick and your eye sight becomes fuzzy or blurred seek medical attention.’

Methanol is produced as a byproduct of a locally made drink called Arak. It needs to be removed to make the drink safe.

Bounty’s operations supervisor, Dewa Mustika, told The Sydney Morning Herald that all their drinks comply with the law.

He said: ‘All our drinks are legal. The health department and customs regularly check us. We have recently been awarded top 10 for safety and service in Bali and we never use anything illegal.’

He added that if they were selling badly made drinks, then more than one person would have fallen ill.
