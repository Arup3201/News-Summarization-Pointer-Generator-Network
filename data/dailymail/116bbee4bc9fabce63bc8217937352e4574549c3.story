The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had a surveillance system the night that Justin Casquejo made it to the top of One World Trade Center, bypassing security. The only problem is the $4,000 system was still packed in its box at the time.

Although the Port Authority bought the system in August, officials didn't want to pay to install it, the New York Post reported today.

A source told the paper that the official who oversaw the purchase was so incensed at what he saw as a very high price for a two-camera system that he decided not to spend any more money to have it up and running.

Daredevil: Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked into the WTC site and spent almost two hours on the roof of the nearly completed Freedom Tower, he is pictured at right on top of a construction crane in nearby Hoboken

Fascinated: Casquejo has long been obsessed with the WTC's Freedom Tower, according to the Post

'He looked at me and my colleague and said, 'Why did I spend $4,000 on this equipment when you could have gone to Home Depot and gotten something cheaper?’’' the source, who is an electrician that worked on the project for a vendor, said.

The system 
ordered is known as a '“Two-Camera DVR Solution System.” It was supposed
 to be installed quickly after the August purchase, the source added, to
 protect the spire that was hoisted in place in May. The spire also 
contains a critically important antenna.

A
 Port Authority spokesman said that the system wasn't installed because 
infrastructure to support the system had not yet reached the top of the 
104-floor building, which is still under construction.

In the early morning hours of March 16, Casquejo, 16, accessed the construction site of the nearly completed tower by 
slipping through a 1-foot opening in a fence at around 4 a.m., 
He then allegedly entered the tower by climbing 
scaffolding.

Casquejo is said to have taken an elevator up to the 88th floor despite not having any identification, according to the paper.

He was let off at the 88th floor and hoofed it up to the 104th floor where he sneaked past a sleeping guard to access the roof.

Casquejo scaled equipment on the roof to reach the 1,776-foot tall Freedom Tower's antenna.

The daredevil spent two hours perched atop the city before trying to sneak his way out as the sun came up.

Boisterous: Casquejo was much more talkative on Twitter than when reached by the Post
