A 22-year-old Florida man was acting out song lyrics with a 17-year-old Monday evening, when he discharged a gun and killed the teenage boy, deputies said Tuesday.

Rodney Clay Patrick Jr. faces manslaughter, tampering with evidence, and possession of a controlled substance charges, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office (BSCO) said in a release.

Deputies said the shooting of Douglay Trey Winslow took place at Patrick's Merritt Island home.

Deputies told WESH that the duo were acting out Wacka Flocka's 'Bustin At 'Em.' The television station pointed out that the song includes the line 'Shoot first, ask questions last.' 

The line 'Pow, pow, pow, pow' is also uttered repeatedly throughout the song.

In a 911 call obtained by WKMG, Patrick says 'I handed my little brother my gun, and I didn't know it was loaded, and he shot himself in the head.'

He later explains to the operator that the victim is actually the younger brother of his girlfriend.

'It was a Colt, it was my 45,' Patrick says on the call. 'He just wanted to see it, he thought it was so cool. I thought I had cleared it and everything.'

'Oh my God, that poor kid,' Patrick says at one point. 'He had so much to live for and I'm stupid for handing him that f****** gun.'

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said in a release 'The investigation determined that the two men were at the residence listening to music when Patrick picked up the firearm, which he thought was not loaded and started acting out the lyrics of the song, which included pointing the firearm at the victim when it discharged, killing the victim.'

The sheriff's office also stated that  Patrick is being held without bond.

Victim: Deputies say Douglas Winslow was killed by Rodney Patrick. Patrick is now facing a manslaughter charge, as well as charges for tampering with evidence and possession of a controlled substance

Speaking to Florida Today, Major Todd Goodyear with the BSCO said 'It's a terrible accident, but there are consequences to your actions. You have to take responsibility. [Patrick] pointed that gun at a person and pulled the trigger.'

'Patrick tried to make it look like the victim shot himself and moved things around,' Goodyear said. 

Florida Today noted that Patrick's Facebook profile includes several photos of him posing with a gun in a bathroom. Those photographs were uploaded in March 2013. 

Patrick's grandmother Virginia Hudmon told the newspaper 'I talked with [Patrick] yesterday and he's real upset about what happened. It was accidental and he was very, very close to that boy.'

Humon also said 'I tried to talk with Patrick by phone yesterday and he told me he would tell me later...he said "Mom, you know it was an accident. You know I loved Trey."'
