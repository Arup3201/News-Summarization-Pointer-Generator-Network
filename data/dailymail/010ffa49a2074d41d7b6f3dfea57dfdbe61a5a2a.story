The mother of a 22-year-old Canadian man who died fighting for ISIS has spoken out to warn parents how easily jihadist groups can manipulate Westerners online.

Christianne Boudreau's son Damian Clairmont converted to Islam at the age of 17 after bullying at high school in Calgary, Alberta, almost drove him to suicide.

Religion seemed to bring him peace, she said, and she thought his plan to visit the Middle East to study Arabic would be a positive experience.

But in 2013, Canadian security officials visited Boudreau to say they strongly suspected her son was not a student in Egypt but a jihadi in Syria.

In January 2014, he was killed fighting for ISIS in Aleppo.

A year on, Boudreau says parents must resist the urge to  blame others and do what they can to address extremist propaganda with their children.

She told CNN: 'The biggest problem we have is that parents - a lot of the time - want to be able to place the blame somewhere else. 

'We want think that our children are safe and it could never happen to us. It's always going to happen to somebody else. That's a big mistake we all make as parents.'

Damian Clairmont, who changed his name to Mustafa Al-Gharib, told the National Post he joined ISIS to work toward an afterlife. 

He is believed to have been shot dead by the Free Syrian Army.  

Challenges: According to Boudreau, Damian had been a happy child (pictured) but became reclusive at school

A year on from Damian's death, Boudreau says parents must actively combat propaganda targeted at kids

According to Boudreau, Damian had been a happy child but became reclusive at school.

Islam was the first thing that seemed to make him grounded, happy and peaceful. 

'I saw some positive changes start to happen,' she told the network. 'He became social again. The old Damian that I knew when he was younger, much younger, was starting to come out. 

'He was socializing, he was peaceful, he was grounded, he wasn't drinking, he wasn't using drugs, there were lots of positive changes.'

However, unbeknownst to her, Damian was slowly becoming radicalized as he searched for extremist literature online and joined a different mosque.

Boudreau maintains that he went to Syria to help women and children but was brainwashed into siding with ISIS.

The biggest challenge for the West is developing a rhetoric that can counteract the Islamic State's persuasive propaganda that is winning over young people worldwide.

'What's out there is only something that can reinforce those ideas so we really need to start challenging the ideologies that are being placed in their minds,' Boudreau said.

Her focus now this past year has been on Clairmont's younger siblings who have been shaken by the ordeal. 

'We were living in a really desperate black hole of trauma and we didn't know how to heal from it, and I was terrified that the anger would burn within them and not being able to cope with this type of trauma and that they would follow the same path,' she said.
