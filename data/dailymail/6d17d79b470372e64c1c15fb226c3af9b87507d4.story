Inspired by an initial few who bravely posted selfies showing their colostomy bags, now a whole movement of young women is sharing Facebook pictures showing theirs as well as the scars received from treatment for their conditions.

The women who suffer from a range of stomach conditions are showing that they are proud of their bodies just the way they are and it's all thanks to Crohn's disease sufferer turned model Bethany Townsend, 23.

Similar to the no make-up selfies campaign in which women encouraged each other to post pics of their natural faces, this new viral campaign sees people inspiring each other with the slogan 'Get Your Belly Out'.

The new craze sees women posting pictures of their tummies to raise awareness of stomach disorders and illnesses

The movement, which was inspired by one Crohn's disease sufferer, has been given the name 'get your belly out'

Hundreds of women have shared their pictures to raise awareness of stomach conditions Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

The craze was started by ulcerative colitis sufferer Victoria Marie, 26, she said: 'It has exploded and become a global success.

'I personally am passionate, driven and inspired to continue working hard at raising awareness for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

'At the age of 26 I feel I have been to hell and back with this illness and it breaks my heart to contemplate how young children cope with such a life changing illness.'

As well as colostomy bags, women are bravely sharing pictures of their scars, often from surgeries for illnesses

The movement aims to combat the stigma and squeamishness people feel around stomach conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis

The thousands of photographs have gone viral - just like make-up free selfies - with women encouraging each other to 'get their belly out'

Victoria, from Swansea, made friends with other suffers following her diagnosis five years ago.

She decided she wanted to confront the stigma and squeamishness people feel when talking about the effects of the condition and other similar ones such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBS).

Bethany Townsend became an internet sensation by posting a photograph of herself in a bikini, exposing the colostomy bags she has to wear because of Crohn's disease

The make-up artists picture has received millions of views, thousands of likes and hundreds of encouraging comments and she is now pursuing her dream of becoming a model.

So together with three friends Victoria started the Get Your Belly Out campaign in a bid to break the taboos.

The campaign has received a swell of attention after Ms Townsend became an internet sensation  after posting a photograph of her in a bikini online - exposing her colostomy bag to the world.

The make-up artist's picture has received millions of views, thousands of likes and hundreds of encouraging comments and she is now pursuing her dream of becoming a model.

What is Crohn's disease?

Crohn's is an autoimmune condition affecting the bowel that is caused when the immune system triggers the release of a protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, which kills the 'good bacteria' in the gut.

This leads to inflammation and, in turn, diarrhoea, stomach pain, weight loss - because of poor digestion of food - and extreme tiredness.

Around 115,000 people in the UK have Crohn's, with most diagnosed between their mid-teens and late 20s.

But new figures suggest that its incidence is rising dramatically - there has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of 16 to 29-year-olds receiving treatment in England for Crohn's in the past ten years, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.

Crohn's is a chronic, often debilitating condition and many patients end up needing surgery to remove part of their bowel.

What is Irretable Bowl Syndrome?

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition of the digestive system. It can cause bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation.

Symptoms vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. However, most people have either diarrhoea, constipation, or bouts of both. You may also have mucus in your stools.

You may find the painful stomach cramps of IBS ease after going to the toilet and opening your bowels.

The symptoms of IBS usually appear for the first time when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age. They tend to come and go in bouts, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods.

What is Ulcerative Colitis?

Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition, where the colon and rectum become inflamed.

Small ulcers can develop on the colon's lining, and can bleed and produce pus.

The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis are recurring diarrhoea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus, abdominal pain and needing to empty your bowels frequently.

The severity of the symptoms varies, depending on how much of the rectum and colon is inflamed and how severe the inflammation is. For some people, the condition has a significant impact on their everyday lives.
