Carlo Ancelotti confirmed Manchester United target Angel Di Maria was dropped from Friday’s Spanish Super Cup defeat against Atletico.

'He was left out for football reasons' Ancelotti said when asked why the Argentine had not even made the bench at the Vincente Calderon Stadium.

The snub for a player who Ancelotti confirmed has asked to leave the club is further proof that relations between player and club have reached the point of no return and will be a source of great encouragement to Manchester United who are weighing up a £50million bid for the Argentine World Cup star.

Dropped: Angel Di Maria was left out of Real Madrid's squad to face Atletico in the Super Cup on Friday night

Real Madrid supporters have left the club in no doubt that they want Di Maria to stay but president Florentino Perez wants him sold to help the club balance the books after their staggering spending spree this summer with the acquisitions of Toni Kroos and James Rodrgiguez.

Madrid were embarrassed by the reaction of the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday when Di Maria came on as a second half substitute and was given a huge ovation by supporters. Ancelotti confirmed on Friday that the player had turned down the offer of a new deal and asked for a move.

But Di Maria’s new deal would only have seen him clear 5million euros and he wants parity with those in the Spanish capital who are in the second tier of Real’s wage structure and earn 8million net a season.

Supporters who saw him play a huge role in Real’s Champions League success last season believe he is worth it but the club have made no second offer and he will be a United player if they find the money to meet both the asking price and the player’s wage demands.

Barcelona paper Sport are suggesting that Barcelona had made a 60m euro bid for the player but the midfielder Xavi dismissed the idea Di Maria could do a ‘reverse Figo’ in moving from between Spain’s big two.

‘He’s a great player but it is very rare that that happens,’ Xavi said. A fan poll on Sport’s website revealed 80 per cent of Barca fans wanting the unlikely swoop to take place. And Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said on Tuesday that he is ‘Real Madrid’s best player’.

It seems everyone bar the Real board want the Argentine. What remains to be seen is if United want him enough and can persuade him to give up Champions League football for a season.
