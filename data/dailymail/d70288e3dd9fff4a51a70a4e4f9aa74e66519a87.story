The so-called 'Goddess of Pop', Cher has taken to Twitter to vent her feelings about Sarah Palin, calling her the ‘Dumb C Word’.

Cher voiced her opinions about the former Alaska governor Sarah Palin on Friday.

‘Go to dictionary & look up The ‘C’ Word.... next 2 the definition...you’ll see a Pic of Sarah PALIN ! NO...WAIT ...SHES UNDER DUMB C WORD,’ says the first tweet from Cher.

Hatred: Singer Cher, left, dislikes Sarah Palin, right, so much that she tweeted her opinions about the politician on Friday, calling Palin a 'dumb c***'

Three minutes later, the singer 
exclaimed: ‘Am here ready to get foot fixed! If I die ... DOUBLE MY LAST
 TWT & Throw in the T -JIHADISTS LOVIN MY CREW.’

There
 is nothing visibly that has provoked the verbal attack from Cher, 
however in an interview in 2010 with Vanity Fair, the singer said she 
got ‘so obsessed’ with C-Span during the presidential election that it 
was ‘interfering’ with her life.

‘Sarah Palin came on, and I thought, 
Oh, f***, this is the end. Because a dumb woman is a dumb woman,’ she 
says in the interview.

Cher also had a few opinionated words about Arizona Governor, Jan Brewer.

‘She
 was worse than Sarah Palin, if that’s possible,’ Cher said. ‘She’s got a
 handle on the services of the state, and I would not let her handle the
 remote control.’
