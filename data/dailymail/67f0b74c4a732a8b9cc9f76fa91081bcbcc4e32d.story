It was the food of kings, but now venison is enjoying a remarkable renaissance on the dinner tables of middle Britain.

Sales of venison as steaks, burgers and sausages are rising sharply, not least because it is seen as a healthier and lower fat alternative to beef.

Data from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel showed that venison sales have rocketed by 413 per cent year on year - from £1.2million in June 2013 to £6.4million last month.

Available in all good supermarkets: Venison stew and venison burgers

While venison has long been available at upmarket stores such as Harrods or Fortnum & Mason, it is now sold across high street chains from Marks & Spencer to festive ranges from the budget grocers Lidl and Aldi.

The term venison comes from the Latin verb ‘venor’ meaning to hunt or pursue and it entered the English language via the Normans who invaded Britain in 1066.

The Normans introduced the concept of royal forests which were set aside for the aristocracy and particularly kings for the hunting of animals such as deer, hare and fowl.

Venison was the choice of the Tudors, most particularly, Henry VIII, but it is now becoming a barbecue favourite for the masses.

Tesco rolled out a seven-strong Chef's Selection range including venison burgers, meatballs and steaks from supplier Highland Game across the country in April.

These include venison sausages, which come in at £3 for a pack weighing 300g; venison steaks with a whisky jus at £6.99 for a 350g pack; and a pack of four venison burgers for £4, which is the same price as the equivalent ‘Finest’ beef burgers.

A Tesco spokesman said: ‘While venison has been widely regarded as the sole preserve of the rich and particularly the country set, the meat is now finding favour with a much wider audience especially in the form of burgers and sausages.

‘Besides being extremely moist and juicy to eat, venison is also very healthy having 30 per cent more iron and being 50 per cent leaner than beef.’ 

Rival Sainsbury's is planning to its own new venison lines under the prestige Taste The Difference brand this autumn, while a Venison Wellington is to be one of the key lines in Asda's Christmas range.

Asda, which is sourcing its Venison Wellington from Northern Ireland supplier Finnebrogue, said the launch reflected the increasing quality of its Christmas range and said that shoppers were looking for a 'wow factor.' 

Asda said: ‘Finnebrogue has put itself on the map and are bringing venison to the fore but in an easy format.’

No longer a royal preserve: Venison served with mustard and bacon strips

The Downpatrick-based supplier, which also make the retailer's Extra Special sausage range, has ramped up production following a £3 million expansion of its facility in January.

Meanwhile, Sainsbury's has increased the distribution of its venison lines which include sausages, burgers and diced steak with a sauce.

Its market share of venison sales had been 33.4per cent in the past 12 weeks --up from 19.6per cent in the same period a year ago.

A spokesman said: ‘We have seen a growing customer demand for the protein, which is why our range now covers added-value venison.’
