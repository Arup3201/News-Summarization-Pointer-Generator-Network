All Eurostar trains travelling from London to Brussels have been cancelled due to anti-austerity strikes in Belgium.  

The nine scheduled trains to the Belgian capital will terminate in Lille, Northern France, today as a result of protests against government austerity measures. 

Around 44 per cent of flights are also cancelled from Brussels' main airports as protests ground the country to a halt.

Labour union leaders have also shut down Eurostar services from Brussels to Paris and other European destinations, as well as the high-speed Thalys train service.

Metro, bus and tram services in Brussels have also been closed as a result of the planned strikes.

The one-day strike is the third in a series of weekly union actions intended to force the government of Prime Minister Charles Michel to backtrack on a program to reform pensions, cut health and social security budgets and raise the retirement age.

Even more travellers are expected to be effected by a general strike throughout Belgium on December 15 that is expected to grind the entire country to a halt.

Eurostar has urged people not to try to travel to Brussels.

'Due to a National Strike in Belgium on the 8th and 15th December 2014, Eurostar services on the Brussels route will only be able to operate to and from Lille Europe on that day,' a statement said.

'Due to the scale of the strike we expect no trains or other public transport to run in Belgium. Eurostar are unable to provide any alternative method of transport between Brussels and Lille and we strongly advise our passengers not to travel on these dates.

'If you have not got in contact to make a change or request a refund, we request that you do so as soon as possible.'

Tuesday's first Eurostar service to Brussels has just three business premier seats remaining while other services are also close to booked out.

A baggage handler strike at Brussels' international airport meant the cancellation of 267 flights out of the country, making up close to half of the airport's total departures.

Picket lines have blocked workers from getting into industrial areas to work, including an Audi car factory and the Infrabel railway company's building in Brussels.  

In November, 100,000 people marches in Brussels in a largely peaceful protest against the austerity measures with 50 people reported injured, including some police, after violence and 30 people detained.
