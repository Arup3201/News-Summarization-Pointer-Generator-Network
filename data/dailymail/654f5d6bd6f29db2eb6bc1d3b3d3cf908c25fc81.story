A mayor has been accused of running his town ‘like North Korea’ after trying to expel a councillor from a debate for tweeting.

Gareth Fairhurst continued to air his views on Twitter after Billy Rotherham told members not to use the network in meetings, so the mayor told the independent Wigan councillor to go and called police when he refused.

Two police community support officers arrived, but councillor Fairhurst knew that, by law, only a fully qualified police officer could eject a member from a council meeting, so continued to stand his ground.

The steps of Wigan town hall: Councillor Fairhurst only left after a police officer came from 20 miles away

Because there were no free officers in
 the town to attend, it was another 20 minutes before a policeman 
arrived from 25 miles away, in Eccles, Greater Manchester.

Amid farcical scenes, the officer admitted no law had been broken, so councillor Fairhurst could not be arrested.

Instead he asked councillor Fairhurst to leave, which he agreed to do, and he was escorted out of the Town Hall. Several other opposition councillors then followed him out the door in protest at his treatment.

Last
 night the meeting was likened to a pantomime, with the Mayor saying his
 grandchildren were better behaved than some members.

Councillor
 Fairhurst said Wigan was being run like ‘North Korea’ by Labour, who 
were using the ban to stifle any criticism of their policies.

He said calling the police was a ‘joke’ and such ‘heavy-handed’ tactics were a complete waste of tax-payers’ cash.

‘We
 are meant to live in a democracy and operate open and transparent 
politics to engage the public, but this behaviour is more akin to North 
Korea than Britain,’ councillor Fairhurst said.

‘The
 Mayor requests that members don’t Tweet from meetings because, they 
say, we should be concentrating fully on what’s going on.

‘But
 that’s just a smoke screen, what they really mean is they don’t want 
anyone Tweeting anything critical of their policies because they want to
 be in control of the messages seen by the public.

‘It’s a complete joke.

‘It
 wasn’t my intention to disrupt the meeting but I thought it was 
important to stand my ground. They were making it up as they went along 
and I knew that they couldn’t just throw me out.

‘Calling
 the police was heavy-handed and a complete waste of taxpayers’ money. I
 knew they were behaving unlawfully and I had to stand up for freedom of
 speech.’

Councillor Fairhurst said he ‘couldn’t help’ taking to the social network when the council leader began referring to a recent survey claiming than 99 per cent of all Wigan residents were happy with the council’s performance.

He tweeted: ‘Leader says 99% of residents are happy with council. I bet 99% or not happy in Standish and other areas.’ Councillor Fairhurst added: ‘I just didn’t believe it, so I passed a comment on Twitter.

‘They must have put a council officer in the chamber to watch me because the next thing I knew she was pointing to my phone and the chief executive was informed.’

Councillor Fairhurst also accused the Labour administration of ‘double standards’ after it emerged another councillor, Labour’s Sue Loudon, also tweeted during the meeting.

She was not thrown out because she supposedly only passed comment on councillor Fairhurst’s ‘disgraceful behaviour’ once the meeting was stopped, while she was waiting for him to be removed.

Mayor Rotherham told councillor Fairhurst: ‘I have got grandchildren who don’t behave like you do.’ While leader Lord Peter Smith later lamented that it was ‘the most atrocious meeting’ he had ever been to.

Councillor Fairhurst said he would be complaining to Local Government Minister Eric Pickles about the council, although stopped short of saying he would take legal action against them.

Mr Pickles announced plans in November to introduce legislation giving people the right to report, film, blog and tweet from council proceedings.

The changes - part of the Local Audit and Accountability Bill - would ‘unlock the mysteries of local government, making it more transparent for all,’ he said.

But so far Wigan has resisted implementing such plans. The council is one of Labour’s safest local councils in the country, with 63 of the 75 councillors affiliated to the party.
