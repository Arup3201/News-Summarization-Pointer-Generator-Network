Children are being ‘infantalised’ by teachers who encourage them to learn history through Mr Men characters and Disney films, Michael Gove said yesterday.

In a blistering attack on school teaching, the Education Secretary claimed pupils were being told to compare Hitler and his henchmen to Mr Men characters and to learn about the Middle Ages by watching Disney’s Robin Hood.

Mr Gove also criticised the debasement of English lessons, saying some schools were telling pupils to read ‘transient vampire books’ like the Twilight series instead of ‘transcendent Victorian novels’ such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.

Students were told to imagine Adolf Hitler as a Mr Men character, Michael Gove said in a damning critique on the way history has been taught in some schools

He said teaching was being ‘crushed 
under the weight of play-based pedagogy which infantilises children, 
teachers and our culture’.

In his speech to an education 
conference in Brighton Mr Gove referred to a website which suggests 
teenagers should translate the story of Nazi Germany into a tale in the 
style of Roger Hargreaves’ Mr Men books.

The website, www.activehistory.co.uk, 
written by a teacher working in France, tells students they should 
‘discuss which characters are the best match’.

‘The activity is a great way of 
rounding off or revising the rise of Hitler,’ it says, adding the 
exercise could also help primary pupils learn about the period.

Mr Gove said history teaching is being 'crushed under the weight of play-based pedagogy'

The Twilight vampire series by Stephanie Meyer was not a patch on George Eliot, Mr Gove said as he warned  young people should dream of taking part in the Olympics, not finding fame in the Big Brother house

Mr Gove 
said: ‘I may be unfamiliar with all of Roger Hargreaves’ work but I am 
not sure he ever got round to producing Mr Anti-Semitic Dictator, Mr 
Junker General or Mr Dutch Communist Scapegoat.’

Author Jacqueline Wilson was praised for speaking out against the 'scandal' of British children unable to use good grammar in fan letters

He also referred to a 2012 issue of 
Primary History, produced by the Historical Association, which suggests 
students learn about the Middle Ages through Disney’s portrayal of King 
John as a cowardly lion.

‘If that proves too taxing then they are asked to organise a fashion parade or make plasticine models,’ he said.

Mr Gove’s comments come amid criticism of his proposed changes to the national curriculum from teachers and education academics.

His plans for history teaching, in 
particular, have come under fire from critics who claim the new focus on
 key dates and characters is too narrow and will impede children’s 
ability to think for themselves.

English lessons were also being dumbed
 down, Mr Gove warned, with the ‘overwhelming majority’ of GCSE pupils 
studying 20th century texts, rather than books from an earlier period.

Mr Gove added: ‘Under this Government...the Department for Education is 
setting higher expectations for every child. Because that is what 
parents want.’

Russell Tarr, who is responsible for 
the activehistory website, said: ‘The purpose of the activity is a 
further challenge to get them (students) to think about it in a 
different way and to take a complex story which they have written an 
in-depth essay about and turn it into something that can be used for 
other students.’

Mr Tarr studied modern history at Lady
 Margaret Hall, Oxford, and worked at Wolverhampton Grammar School 
before becoming head of history at the International School of Toulouse.
