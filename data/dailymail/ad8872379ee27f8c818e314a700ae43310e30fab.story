These photographs show a killer black bear as it closes in on its victim, a 22-year-old student who tried to flee but was caught and mauled by the creature.

The images were taken by Darsh Patel, a senior year student who died in September while hiking with friends in New Jersey.

Police officers - who found the bear standing guard over his corpse before they shot it dead - recovered the photographs from his phone, which seemed to have been bitten by the bear.

Killer: This bear, photographed by its victim Darsh Patel, 22, killed him while he was hiking with his friends

Close-up: The 302-pound bear followed at a distance first, then closed on Patel and his friends

Recovered: The cellphone photographs were released by officers, who found the phone with a bite mark near Patel's corpse

They show the 302-pound creature around 100ft away in the woods of the Apshawa Preserve, around an hour's drive north of Rutgers University, where Patel was a student.

Patel - the first victim of a New Jersey bear attack in 150 years - was hiking with four friends when he encountered the bear, according to NJ.com.

The group had been warned about the bear by hikers heading away from it - but went closer to take a look.

Killed: Rutgers student Darsh Patel, 22, was killed

Patel and his friends turned around when the bear got within 300ft, but it kept following. When it got to within 15 feet, the group split up and fled.

The hikers say Patel lost one of his shoes during the hike, and was 'extremely winded' when the group split up.

They last saw him climbing some rocks in an attempt to get away from the bear. He shouted for them to keep running.

After they fled, the group called police, who found Patel's mauled corpse being guarded by the beast.

It was behaving aggressively, so officers killed it with two shotgun blasts: one to the shoulder and another to the jaw.

Later DNA tests found bits of cloth in the bear's stomach, as well as Patel's DNA around its mouth and claws.

Patel is believed to be the first human killed by a bear in New Jersey.
