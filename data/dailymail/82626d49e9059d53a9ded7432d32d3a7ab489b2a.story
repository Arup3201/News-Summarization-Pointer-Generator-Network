I hope the Jack Wilshere critics will pipe down now.

It was a moment that flashed by, it happened in the blink of an eye. But it proved that Wilshere has world-class ability, and if he adds consistency to his game for club and country – in terms of performance and fitness – then he may be considered world class sooner rather than later.

England had just conceded an own goal on Saturday and were trailing 1-0 to a side sitting just behind them in the group. Slovenia were setting out to stop England getting back into the game so a bit of magic was needed from someone wearing the Three Lions.

Straight after the restart, Wilshere demanded and received the ball from Phil Jagielka in the Wembley centre circle. 

He turned and with an opponent on top of him, had the option of passing backwards to Gary Cahill, or sideways to Nathaniel Clyne. Neither were bad options, both would have meant England kept possession, which of course is vital.

Wilshere chose to do neither. Instead he turned and smartly flicked the ball away from the opponent with his left foot and scooted away, leading the charge and leaving his man standing. That was a touch of world-class ability.

Had he lost the ball England could easily have found themselves two down.

Wilshere is often a target for criticism but he has the ability to be a world-class player for England and Arsenal

But with incredible speed of thought and feet, Wilshere controlled the ball, gauged how quickly his opponent was charging in and executed a move to open the pitch up. It meant Slovenian players had to close him down leaving spaces for Wilshere to exploit.

So the next task, having created space for himself, was to spot a pass. And he found Wayne Rooney with a perfect ball. 

The captain ran at Slovenia, won a penalty and England were level seconds after going behind. That Wilshere-Rooney link-up is something I’ve written about before in this column. It’s a special understanding few players have.

From the moment Wilshere receives the ball to the penalty being awarded takes less than nine seconds. 

That’s the kind of special football England need to produce in games. The more Wilshere feels comfortable doing that sort of thing in the middle of the park in an England shirt, the more likely it is to happen in a tournament against a big team.

I’m not saying Wilshere is world class. I am saying he has the ability to become world class.

In terms of international football, the real test will come at the European Championship of course. But I’m delighted to see Wilshere, a player of such immense promise, starting to consistently fulfill that.

Wilshere hasn't always had it his own way at Arsenal with stalled progress over the last couple years

Apparently Chris Waddle, a player of immense talent who I greatly admired, said Wilshere didn’t deserve man of the match, even adding that no England player was worth it.

That must be disappointing for the Arsenal midfielder after he grabbed hold of the game when England went behind. It takes special character to demand the ball when the pressure is on and the team isn’t playing well. It takes special talent to then do what Wilshere did for the equaliser.

I’m comfortable criticising England when it’s due. But when a player delivers, let’s give him the credit he deserves.

Carry on Jack.
