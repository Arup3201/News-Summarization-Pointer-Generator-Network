Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari showed signs of strain as he tried to defend his team’s goalless draw with Mexico in a fractious post match press conference.

The host nation remain well placed to qualify after their draw in Fortaleza but the famously combustible Scolari was in no mood to accept any criticism at the Estadio Castelao.

'In my opinion, my opinion not yours, I think the team has played ten per cent better than when we played Croatia,' said Scolari.

Strain: Brazil failed to find the target as they struggled to a goalless draw with Mexico

Embrace: Scolari hugging Mexico coach Miguel Herrera after the final whistle

'The team is doing better, we are improving and we have good quality. I was happy with what I saw.

'We tend to think that other countries are not good, but Mexico played as well as we did.

'They had ball possession, shots on goal – look, they know how to play football.

'I did not like their goalkeeper (Guillermo Ochoa). He was really spectacular, he did a great job, he was calm and confident on the pitch - he was the man of the match.'

Scolari was asked about his decision to play lumbering centre forward Fred instead of the alternative Hulk and was also asked if he believed his team was going backwards after opening 3-1 win over Croatia.

'No, I don’t agree with you,' he responded.

Struggle: Forward Fred had a difficult time of it against Mexico

Change up: The only difference in the line up from their opening game was Ramires, who started instead of Hulk

'I have already told you ten times that I trust my players.

'I work with the line-up that I want, you (press) can create your own teams, but you will not have an impact on what I think.

'This is my team and I may replace some of them. 'I started with Ramires today, but maybe I will start with others against Cameroon.

'We just need to score goals, but they had a good goalkeeper who played very well.

Mexico had a very good keeper on a very good day, which is why we couldn’t win.'
