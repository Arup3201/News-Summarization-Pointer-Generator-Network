A private Native American school in South Dakota has been exposed fabricating 'sob stories' of disadvantaged and displaced children in order to appeal for charity donations and handouts - and collecting millions of dollars while doing so.

St. Joseph's Indian School - a 200-person boarding school in Chamberlain - collected over $50 million in fundraising last year using a national marketing campaign that involves mailing 'help packets' all over the country.

The packets feature children apparently in need, such as one little boy, Josh Little Bear, who says his father gets drunk and beats him and 'mom chose drugs over me'.

However the children are not real, a CNN investigation has discovered.

Marketing campaign exposed: St Joseph's Indian School in Chamberlain, South Dakota, sends out 30 million mailing packets each year appealing for donations

Mail packet: The packages contain notebooks, stickers and even a Dreamcatcher and ask for donations

Fabricated: The school has admitted the personalized notes in each packet, such as this one from 'Josh Little Bear' are made up

Fake: The children that appear in the campaign do not go the school, a CNN investigation has shown

With 30 million charity packets sent out last year, the approach has been attacked as 'poverty porn'.

'They are raising money in the name of Indians, using the worst of poverty porn of all Indian country to raise money on all our social ills,' Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute, told CNN.

Leonard Pease, vice chairman of the nearby Crow Creek Lakota Sioux reservation in central South Dakota, said the mail packets are a scam the school has been using for years.

'That's how they get their money,' he told CNN.

'To me, they make the Indians look bad.'

Kory Christianson, the director of development at St. Josephs, admitted the school's marketing campaign 'pushed the edge'.

'The name 'Josh Little Bear' is fictitious, but unfortunately, his story is not,' Christianson said. 

'(The letter) is a true story of the very real and challenging situations that far too many children face not only in the Native American community, but in families found in every sphere of society.'

'Poverty porn': Michael Roberts, president of the First Nations Development Institute, said the school is operating a scam

Offended: Leonard Pease, vice chairman of the nearby Crow Creek Lakota Sioux reservation in central South Dakota, said the school is giving Indians a bad name

Good services: The school is said to be putting the donated money to good use

Students: The boarding school in South Dakota is home to 200 students

He said it wasn't the 'intention to disparage in any way the Native American community'.

A Christmas appeal was sent around in November.

Inside were a calendar, notepads, stickers and a Dreamcatcher.

There was a letter from a girl, Emily High Elk, who apparently arrived at St. Joseph's one year ago.

'You could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes,' the letter said.

'(Now) her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed.'

Financial records show St. Joseph's collected $51 million in donations last year.

The school's 2013 finanical statement listed its cash on hand at $122 million.

That is an increase of $18.5 million on the previous year.

However CNN noted that it appeared the school was putting the donations to good use, with decent facilities and happy students.
