Daniel Levy reportedly told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust that after the problems reinvesting the money received for Gareth Bale, future transfer policy would entail the purchase of young players, priced between £10-15million with good potential for resale. This may be financially sensible, but it is hardly reassuring.

Elite clubs, those who challenge for the biggest trophies, do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set Tottenham back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at Manchester United by trading top performers such as Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov.

Indeed, the only time Tottenham demonstrated real Champions League potential was when Levy resisted the likes of Chelsea over Luka Modric.

Spurs' best chance of securing regular Champions League football came when Luka Modric played for them

The moment they started to sell again, Tottenham fell away.

Not even having the Premier League's top goalscorer in Harry Kane has placed them among the elite again — and it is hard to see how that will change if this is the plan. 

Nobody overtakes Manchester United by offering a helping hand — no matter how favourable the price.

Even the exploits of Premier League top goalscorer Harry Kane hasn't been enough to get Spurs top-four
