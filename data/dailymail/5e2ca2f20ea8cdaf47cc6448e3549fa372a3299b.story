The identities of the three women who died on Friday after their car plunged off a pier, have been revealed as one American and two tourists. 

U.S.-born Jennifer Way, Louise Owen of the United Kingdom and Femmetje Staring of the Netherlands, all 39, were inside the car when the driver took a wrong turn.

Ms Way worked as a yacht manager for Marine Construction Management. Further details of the other two women have not yet been released.

Their car fell into the Newport Harbour, Rhode Island, landing on its roof, submerged in water.

Part of the Hyundai Accent was 
sticking out of about four feet of water when it was discovered around 
6:30 a.m. at the Newport Shipyard, a privately owned marina near several
of the tourist city's largest hotels and vacation condo complexes, 
Newport police Capt. Fred Gonsalves said.

He said police are still investigating when the car went into the water and why, but said they did not suspect foul play.

The car had Rhode Island plates, where Ms Way was from, but Gonsalves said he did not know whether it was owned by the women or whether it was a rental.

The
car was hauled out of the water by a crane around 8:30 am. It had been 
there for several hours and was first spotted by a fuel deliveryman who 
alerted authorities.

The driver apparently missed a right-hand turn, Newport police Capt. Russell Hayes told The Newport Daily News.

'I'm not sure if they intended to take the turn here and missed it because it was dark and because of weather conditions,' Hayes told the paper.

A dense fog advisory was in effect in Newport until 9 a.m.

The car went into the water near an area called the Travelift pit, the place in the marina where boats are lifted in and out of the water.

Among the services the shipyard provides are dockage for luxury yachts and sailboats, as well as services for their owners, such as showers and workout facilities.

Coast Guard Petty Officer Ryan O'Hare earlier said that the car had been in the water for at least several hours. 

Newport Fire Department Deputy Chief Frank Young said firefighters wearing wetsuits and goggles discovered the women inside the car in the shallow water.

The shipyard is open 24 hours, and a security guard is posted at the entrance at all times.

A spokeswoman for the shipyard referred all questions to police.
