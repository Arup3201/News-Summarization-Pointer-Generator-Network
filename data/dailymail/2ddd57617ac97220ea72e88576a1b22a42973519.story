His father's death during the Second World War has tormented Roger Waters his entire life, serving as the inspiration for the timeless album The Wall.

The Pink Floyd legend was just a five month old baby when Eric Waters Fletcher perished during the 1944 Italy landings. His remains were never found.

Now the rock star has revealed that his lifelong journey to come to terms with his father’s fate ‘has finally come to the end’.

70 years later, to the day, Waters has established a monument to the heroic sacrifice of the father he never knew, giving him finally a place to mourn.

Second Lieutenant Waters died on 18th February 1944 while serving with the Royal Fusiliers as they advanced through Italy in one of the most bitterly fought campaigns of the entire war.

The 31-year-old from Cambridge was killed during the initial wave of fighting as the Allies attempted to take the beachhead at Anzio, south of Rome. Allied forces suffered 43,000 casualties before they took the medieval monastery of Montecasino and eventually Rome.

The pain Waters felt at never knowing his father inspired several Pink Floyd songs and is associated in particular with When The Tigers Broke Free.

The film and album The Wall tell the story of a troubled musician called Pink left scarred by the death of his father in World War II.

Yesterday the singer laid wreaths as he unveiled the monument at the Roselli Institute in the Italian town of Aprilia, south of Rome, near the site of Lt Waters death.

The rock musician told how his conscientious objector father, working as an ambulance driver, had signed up for a commission in 1943 after becoming convinced that it was ‘a necessary war’.

The famously pacifist Waters said: ‘I learnt from my father the example of standing by your principles and beliefs.

‘He thought he was fighting a necessary fight against the Nazis. I think he was too. He paid the ultimate price.’

Signing up, he explained, ‘cost my father his life but secured for him a place among all the other heroes who stand up for what they know to be right.’

The lead singer only learnt for the first time last year how his father died after a veteran soldier read about his visit to the Commonwealth Grave Cemetery at Montecassino.

Anzio veteran Harry Schindler unearthed dispatches and maps that enabled him to pinpoint the exact spot where Lieutenant Waters died.

According to the documents, from the National Archives in Kew, Waters’ company tried to advance on a heavily defended German position. Fierce fighting from the British initially led the enemy to withdraw.

But moving dispatches on the final day read: 'Further attack on Z coy. This time in greater strength than previous attack.' An hour later it reads: 'Z coy reported enemy all round their positions, very stiff fighting going on.' At 11.30am the final report reads: 'Lt Waters killed and Lt Hill wounded, situation now critical.'

Yesterday Mr Schindler, 93, who also attended the ceremony, said that the plinth is ‘a monument to a young boy growing up without knowing his father’.

He said: ‘Roger has it all now. I hope for him to open a new chapter, that the waters, so to speak, are calmer. This wall at least is down.’
