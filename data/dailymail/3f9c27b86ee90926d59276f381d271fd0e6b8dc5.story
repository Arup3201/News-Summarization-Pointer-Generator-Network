Japanese scientists have created what they claim to be the world's thinnest condoms, which are one sixth the width of a human hair.

The thickness of the rubber in the ultra-light polyurethane contraceptive tool has been measured at 0.01 millimeters, with the average width of a human hair measuring 0.06 millimeters.

The Sagami Original 0.1 ultra-thin Polyurethene condom is the world's thinnest, according to manufacturers

According to reports, it took creators Sagami Rubber industries more than a decade to complete the design of the material.

They claim over 20,000 condoms were put through rigorous stress tests to ensure they were safe for human use.

Sagami have a track record of pioneering change in the world of contraceptive technology.

According to the manufacturers it took 10 years to develop a rubber which was both thin and safe

They were the first company to create a colour condom, and set a previous thinness standard in 2005 when they released a 0.02 millimeter version in 2005. 

Their products are streets ahead of western contraceptive technology with the biggest brand in the U.S. only offering a condom which is 0.06 millimeters thick.

Launched in Tokyo two weeks ago, the 'Sagami Original 0.01' costs the equivalent of £7.30 for a box of five.

According to reports, they have been flying off the shelves in Japan, with many stores having sold out.

Researchers told Japanese TV show Tokyo Sports, that they were now exploring the possibility of going even thinner.

A researcher for Sagami, told Brian Ashcroft of Kotaku.com: 'Honestly, I don't how we can make them thinner than this.

'But as long as there is a need for thinner, we will continue researching 0.009 millimeter and 0.008 millimeter thinness.'
