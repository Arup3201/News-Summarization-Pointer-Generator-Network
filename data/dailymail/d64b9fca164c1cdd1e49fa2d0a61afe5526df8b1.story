Energy companies are making £101 profit a year from every family – an astonishing 1,000 per cent increase in just five years.

Industry regulator Ofgem yesterday announced a full-blown inquiry into the energy market as it revealed that the profit figure had doubled from £48 last year, despite a fall of up to 38 per cent in wholesale gas and electricity prices.

Ofgem confirmed that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will investigate the energy market and whether the major players are taking advantage of price movements to unfairly boost profits.

Industry regulator Ofgem yesterday announced a full-blown inquiry into the energy market as it revealed that the profit figure had doubled from £48 last year, despite a fall of up to 38 per cent in wholesale gas and electricity prices.

The
 regulator has been highly critical of the ‘big six’ companies – British
 Gas, Npower, SSE, EDF, Eon and Scottish Power – for not passing on the 
fall in wholesale prices to customers.

Ofgem
 chief executive Dermot Nolan said: ‘Now is the right time to refer the 
energy market to the CMA for the benefit of consumers.

‘The CMA investigation offers an important opportunity to clear the air. The energy market is also going to change rapidly over the next few years. 

‘A CMA investigation should ensure 
there are no barriers to stop effective competition bearing down on 
prices and delivering the benefits of these changes to consumers.’

Ofgem’s
 figures highlight a steady and painful rise in energy bills and profit 
margins over the past five years – a time when some consumers have faced
 a nightmare choice between heating and eating.

In 2009, the average annual wholesale cost of energy was £756 per household and the average bill was £1,282. Once other costs were taken into account, this left the energy companies with an average profit per customer of £9.

A year ago, the profit margin was up to £48. The latest figure shows the average wholesale cost has fallen even further to £612, yet the average bill has jumped again to £1,346, taking the average profit margin per household to £101 – a 1,000 per cent increase in just five years.

Ofgem said the price of gas for next-day delivery was at its lowest level since September 2010 and was 38 per cent down on last year.

Prices for electricity were 23 per cent lower than in June 2013. Energy firms, however, buy most of their gas and electricity at long-term prices. These have also fallen over the past few months, but not as dramatically.

The executive director of consumer group, Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘This is a watershed moment for the broken energy market and millions of people struggling to cope with spiralling bills.‘The investigation must leave no stone unturned.’

Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy added: ‘This investigation is long overdue and needs to lift the floorboards on the energy market and take a long, hard look at why it fails consumers.’

Labour MP John Robertson called for massive fines if any of the companies are found guilty of rigging the market and bills.

He said: ‘The tens of millions in fines should go straight back into the pockets of consumers who have been ripped off all these years.’

Angela Knight, the chief executive of the industry’s trade body Energy UK, said: ‘The competition inquiry will allow us to put to bed the toxic debate and shine a light on the progress the industry has already made.’
