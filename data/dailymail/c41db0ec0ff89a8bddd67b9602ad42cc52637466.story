Pippa Middleton sat down for her first ever TV interview today to tell the world 'what it is like to be Pippa'.

Until now, the 30-year-old magazine columnist has never spoken publicly on her life in the spotlight as sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton - or that bridesmaid's dress which brought her so much attention at the Royal Wedding in 2011.  

Miss Middleton was interviewed by Today's Matt Lauer who had flown to London to speak with her for a two-part segment to be aired on Monday and Tuesday.

Matt Lauer enjoyed a cup of tea during his interview with Pippa Middleton in London on Wednesday where she revealed on camera for the first time what its like 'to be Pippa'

She appeared briefly on camera with Lauer on Wednesday as the pair had just finished taping the interview.

Lauer joked that he had to catch an overnight flight to London for his hour-long chat with Pippa, to which she responded: 'I hate to say it but I was actually in America last week.'

She giggled at Lauer's feigned protests, adding: 'Sorry.'

The pair chatted over a cup of tea at an outdoor table in a sunny London garden.

Miss Middleton, looking tanned in a low-cut white shirt with jeans and tasteful gold jewellery, said very little during the minute-long clip except to add: 'I was on my bike.'

The party-planner, who looked immaculate with pared down make-up and a glossy blow-dry, recently completed a marathon, 3,000 mile cycle across the U.S. with her brother James.

The siblings and five other men had 
set off from California last week on the Race Across America with the 
aim of crossing 12 states to raise money for charity.

They
 cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, 
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.

After finishing, Pippa, 30, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, described the experience as 'brilliant'.

Asked if she had suffered saddle sores, she laughed and said: 'It wasn't too bad. I think it was because I chose a particularly comfy saddle.'

Challenges don't stop there for the Celebrate author - she is soon to be on her way to Istanbul to take on the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Race, a 6.5km historical swim that crosses from Europe to Asia.

Miss Middleton has been keeping busy since being dropped by her American publisher Viking Press  after her party-planning book Celebrate sold just 18,000 copies. 

It was announced in May that Pippa had been dropped as a columnist for The Daily Telegraph after just six months.

She still writes for Vanity Fair and is associated with the supermarket Waitrose. 

Matt Lauer gained a worldwide exclusive with Pippa Middleton. It is the first time Pippa has given a TV interview after her sister became a member of the British Royal Family
