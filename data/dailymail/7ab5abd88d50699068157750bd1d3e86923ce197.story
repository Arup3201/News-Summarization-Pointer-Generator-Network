For most of her life young Queensland woman Samantha Geldenhuys thought she was an ordinary Australian girl with a loving mum and younger brother living in a beachside suburb of Townsville.

Then the Australian Federal Police came knocking on the door of the family home and arrested Sam's mother.

That was when the pretty young blonde learned she was the subject of one of America’s longest running child kidnapping cases, and that her mother's real name was Dorothy Barnett and that she was an international fugitive wanted by US federal authorities.

And that over in South Carolina a wealthy stockbroker by the name of Benjamin Harris Todd III had never given up hope of finding her - and that Sam's birth name was Savanna Todd.

'She just took me and ran,' Sam told Channel Seven. 'She started anew just for me.'

Confused: For 20 years Samantha Geldenhuys (pictured) thought she was an ordinary young woman, but then police came and arrested her mother at their Townsville home and Sam learned she was the centre of America’s longest running child kidnapping case and her Mum was an international fugitive

Never gave up hope: Savanna's father Benjamin Todd II (pictured with his baby daughter in 1994) never stopped hoping his kidnapped daughter would be found and each year updated her room and made a video for each of her birthdays

Dorothy Lee Barnett pictured with baby Savanna kidnapped her daughter after a bitter custody battle and absconded to South Africa and eventually Australia where she lived as a fugitive under an assumed name until her lie unravelled following a slip of the tongue while drinking with friends

The only father she knew: Savanna, pictured as a toddler, was renamed Samantha. She is in the arms of the man she thought was her father, her stepfather, Juan Geldenhuys, who later died before Samantha learned the incredible truth about her past

Another life: Samantha pictured with the mother she knew as Alex Geldenhuys, whose real name was revealed as Dorothy Barnett following her dramatic arrest in Queensland last year and deportation back to a US Jail

It was a lot to take in the blur that followed. Sam's mother made several appearances during extradition hearings in a Queensland court before Ms Barnett was finally deported to the US and immediately placed in prison.

Channel Seven's Sunday Night programme accompanied Ms Geldenhuys to the US for a tearful reunion with her mother and to attend 53-year-old Ms Barnett's trial on Parental Kidnapping and US Passport Fraud charges, for which she is now serving prison time.

The dramatic events of Sam's past began on an access visit in 1994, when Dorothy Barnett did not return baby Savanna to Benjamin Todd and the two disappeared.

Todd and Barnett had been engaged in a bitter custody battle, but each side has different reasons for the failure of their doomed relationship.

Benjamin Todd II was a softly spoken 'southern gentleman' and classical music lover, the son of a nurse and a doctor from Kentucky who entered a career working at financial management company Merrill Lynch in Charleston, South Carolina.

Dorothy Lee Barnett, had been raised by a single mother and stepfather on welfare, and had travelled extensively, running a piggery in Belize, a jewellery business in Africa, before finally settling for a job as a flight attendant.

Loving relationship: Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and had a son

When the pair met, and married after a whirlwind romance, Dorothy became pregnant with her daughter.

Dorothy Barnett's friends told the Seven Network that Benjamin Todd had wanted Barnett to terminate her pregnancy with Savanna in 1993.

But when the marriage failed, it was Todd who gained custody of Savanna following a court case in which he alleged Barnett was bipolar, and she was awarded only supervised access to her baby daughter.

It was on one of these visits Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and they had a son.

Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said

Nervous: Benjamind Todd II (left on television during the years he searched for his daughter) and (right) last year after learning his 20 year wait had come to an end, but at a time when he was still unsure whether Savanna/Samantha would want to meet him

The couple emigrated to New Zealand, where they gained citizenship, and then Barnett and her children moved to Australia's Sunshine Coast, where they were known as Alexandria, Samantha and Rhys Geldenhuys.

It was over evening drinks after a day's sailing in 2011 that 'Alex Geldenhuys' slipped up.

Ms Barnett referred to Samantha as 'Savanna' and said she had fled an 'abusive' relationship in America.

Barnett's South African friends went online and found a page on the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's website. 

They saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger 'Alex' and an age-advanced photo of a girl who resembled Samantha.

They contacted Benjamin Todd III  in America. His long hunt for Savanna was over.

Tearful reunion: Samantha speaks on a phone to her mother inside the South Carolina prison where Dorothy Barnett is serving time for her kidnap and passport fraud offences

As Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter.

'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said.

'It is a parent's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [but] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery.'

However, friends of Ms Barnett described Todd as an 'evil, evil man' while Barnett herself described his pursuit of her as 'corrupt' and 'criminal'.

Whatever is the truth, the extraordinary story of how Ms Barnett eluded the FBI for two decades, and how her life as a lie unravelled, is said to have 'deeply confused' 21-year-old Samantha.

Channel Seven filmed her as she reunited with Ms Barnett in the South Carolina prison where she is serving a 21 month sentence after pleading guilty to one count of International Parental Kidnapping and two counts of False Statement in a Passport Application. 

Ms Barnett will be required to undergo two years’ supervised parole following her release.

While Channel Seven has not yet revealed whether Samantha finally meets her real father, there has been emotions running high on both sides.

'His daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet,' J Graham Sturgis, told Daily Mail Australia.

'She only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her. She likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [Todd] at this time.'

Mr Sturgis said the intensely private stockbroker understood why the daughter snatched from him and who never knew him as father had  held off from speaking with him, and that he feared jeopardising his hoped-for reunion with her.

But Mr Sturgis said Todd yearned for the 'long awaited opportunity' of meeting Savanna and had literally counted the days - 19 years, six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which Savanna disappeared  to when Australian police knocked on a door in faraway Townsville and his long lost daughter was found.

This episode of Sunday Night hosted by Chris Bath airs on Sunday, March 5 at 7pm on the Seven Network.
