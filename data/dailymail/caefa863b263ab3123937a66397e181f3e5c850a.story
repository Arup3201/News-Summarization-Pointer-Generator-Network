David Lammy said he refused to ¿share a platform¿ with criminals seeking to take advantage of anger over the inquest into his death

An MP boycotted a vigil for dead gangster Mark Duggan because he feared it would be hijacked by violent anarchists.

David Lammy said he refused to ‘share a platform’ with criminals seeking to take advantage of anger over the inquest into his death.

The Labour MP for Tottenham also appeared to row back on previous comments made within hours of the jury’s decision last week.

Mr Lammy branded the ‘lawful killing’ ruling as ‘perplexing and seemingly contradictory’ amid uproar from Duggan’s family and supporters.

But speaking yesterday, he added that he will also not support those who ‘do not accept’ that the jury reached their own conclusions.

His comments came after his name drew cries of ‘shame’ during a peaceful vigil outside Tottenham Police Station on Saturday afternoon.

Police commanders feared criminal gangs could try to exploit simmering racial tensions reignited by the row over his death at the hands of police marksmen.

Members of the Duggan family, who vowed ‘no justice, no peace’ outside the High Court, released 20 white doves during a minute’s silence.

Last week a jury ruled a police officer was right to shoot the 29-year-old father-of-six dead after his minicab was stopped in Tottenham in August 2011.

The death of the drug-dealing gangster, who collected a lethal 9mm pistol minutes earlier from an accomplice, sparked riots in towns and cities across England.

Speaking on the BBC Andrew Marr Show yesterday, Mr Lammy said he was worried there are ‘different groups with different aces to grind jumping on the bandwagon’.

‘I have done a lot to support this family and will continue to do that but I will not share a platform with anarchist groups and people that do not accept that a jury laboured and reached a verdict,’ he added.

‘There is a legal process that continues, there is an IPCC investigation, and it is my job to continue to put pressure on that organisation.

‘But anarchists and extreme protest groups ... I’m not prepared to share a platform and I have always been consistent on that.’

The inquest jury of seven women and three men, all drawn from the borough of Haringey, was thrust into the spotlight after their ruling last week.

After listening to three months of evidence they found that although Duggan had thrown away his gun, the police officer was justified in shooting him.

This was because they believed his dramatic testimony when he said his ‘honestly held belief’ was that the young thug was about to point a lethal weapon at him.

Unprecedented scenes of violence and intimidation engulfed the High Court as supporters of Duggan screamed abuse at the jury, lawyers and police.

In the following hours, supporters of the Duggan family questioned the ruling and said they were considering a judicial review.

The coroner is to ask the Duggan family for their views on how armed police should tackle dangerous criminals.

Judge Keith Cutler, pictured, who in the past has admitted he enjoys having the power to show leniency, said their thoughts could influence his recommendations to the Home Secretary following the case.

Judge Cutler has already faced questions about his handling of the inquest, with claims he treated the Duggan family with ‘kid gloves’.

Mr Lammy’s party colleague Diane Abbott, who represents nearby Hackney North, also questioned the inquest outcome.

The former frontbencher said she was ‘baffled’ and ‘startled’ by the jury’s ruling said there would be ‘questions to be asked’.

But she faced criticism for appearing to second guess their conclusions and appeared on TV the next day to say she was not ‘challenging’ the decision.

Police were relieved when Saturday’s vigil of more than 500 people passed without any serious confrontation.

 community leaders had warned that anarchists were trying to cling onto 
the family’s campaign as criminals warned of violence on social 
networks.

Carole Duggan, the dead man’s aunt, called for a fresh investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

‘Mark did not get the justice he deserved from the inquest, so we have no alternative but to go back to basics, start at the beginning,’ she said.

During the inquest, the Met said Duggan was a key member of a feared gang but his family insisted he was a happy-go-lucky family man.

Officers remain on alert across the capital amid fears of a repeat of the riots which followed a similar protest outside Tottenham Police Station.

Five people died and damage estimated at more than £200m was caused during four-days of mayhem after Duggan’s death almost three years ago.
