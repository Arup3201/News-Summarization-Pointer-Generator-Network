 

The Prime Minister has labelled extremist movement the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as one of 'utter ferocity' and 'medieval barbarism' and says it is now a problem for Australians.

In announcing a counter-terror package of $64 million, Tony Abbott said 'because of the Australians who are involved with this movement, what might otherwise be a problem in a far away country is a problem for us'.

Mr Abbott added that there are ' there are at least 60 Australians fighting with the ISIL movement in Iraq and Syria'.

Tony Abbott has announced $64 million in anti-terror measures including programs in Australia to stop youths being lured by extremist groups

'Obviously we are boosting our security services generally,' he added.

The money, Mr Abbott said, would be specifically spent to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation' and the battle would begin at home.

A key part of this will be local community programs aimed at stopping Australian youths being drawn in by extremist organisations.

'We have got new laws to ensure that people who are coming back from terrorist activity in the Middle East can be arrested and detained,' he said.

'It's also important, though, that we engage with the community so that everyone understands that the enemy here is terrorism.

'This is a movement, as we have seen on our TV screens and on the front pages of our newspapers, of utter ferocity, medieval barbarism, that is how serious and dangerous this movement is,' he said.

The ISIL movement, which is allegedly led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been labelled one of 'utter ferocity and medieval barbarism' by Prime Minister Tony Abbott

In keeping with his 'Team Australia' message of last week, Mr Abbott went to pains to stress that this was not about a specific party of the Australian community.

'It's not any particular religion,' he added.

'What we are targeting is extremism, not members of any particular community.'

The package includes $13.4 million boost to community engagement programs and $6.2 million to establish a new Australian Federal Police Community Diversion and Monitoring Team to target returning foreign fighters and their supporters.

An additional $32.7 million will go toward a multi-agency national disruption group to investigate and disrupt foreign fighters and their supporters and a further $11.8 million for new local and regional AFP liaison officers. 

The Prime Minister said that the best defence against radicalisation was 'well informed and well equipped' families and communities

Mr Abbott said the best defence against radicalisation was 'well informed and well equipped' families and communities.

'We want to stop radicalised youngsters from leaving this country to join terrorist groups overseas, we want to work with our allies and partners to try to monitor them while they are overseas,' Mr Abbott said.

'We want to be able to charge them and jail them where they have been working with terrorist groups overseas.'The security and terror travel announcements made last month have bolstered the Coalition's standing, according to the latest Newspoll.

The federal Coalition has trimmed Labor's slim lead, which also shows voters are in favour of the government's proposed terror travel laws.

The poll shows the Coalition has picked up one point in the past fortnight in the two party-preferred results, trailing Labor 51 per cent to 49 per cent, but is still 4.5 points below its election result last year. 

The Coalition's support, after the PM also announced new terror travel laws worth $630 million last month, has enjoyed a slight increase to cut Labor's lead in the latest Newspoll

No change has been recorded in the primary votes of the two major parties since the previous Newspoll, with the Coalition on 40 per cent and Labor on 34 per cent.

An overwhelming 77 per cent of Australians are in favour of proposed new laws for travellers returning from countries such as Iraq and Syria having to prove they are not involved with terrorist groups.

A total of 18 per cent were against the laws.

Despite that vote of confidence, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has jumped above Tony Abbott in who would make a better prime minister.

Mr Shorten gained three points to 40 per cent, with Mr Abbott dropping two points to 39 per cent.
