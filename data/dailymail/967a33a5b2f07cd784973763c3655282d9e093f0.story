Northern Territory politician Larisa Lee has avoided jail after pleading guilty to assaulting her niece for having an affair with her partner.

Lee, 31, faced the Katherine Magistrates Court on Tuesday, having told reporters as she arrived that she felt 'It will all come to an end, finally... it will be a good outcome'.

She pleaded guilty to common assault and disorderly conduct charges.

Palmer United Part member for the Northern Territory Larisa Lee has been found guilty of common assault after she attacked her nieceÂ 

The court heard that on April 24, the Palmer United Party MLA found out her niece Sherese Dooley, 18, was having an affair with her partner, Benjamin Ulamari, after finding photos on his phone.

She tracked her niece to the Katherine Centrelink and called her outside to discuss the affair, before assaulting her.

'Instead of talking through the issues, you responded in a different way,' Magistrate Elisabeth Armitage said.

'You got out of the car when you saw her, you went up to her, grabbed her by the hair and dragged her across a concrete driveway.

'You didn't stop there, but then proceeded to punch her a number of times to the head with a closed fist. You swore at her and threatened her.'

Ms Dooley escaped the assault with a cut to her knee and many people witnessed the incident.

Lee's lawyer Ron Hope said her 'emotions boiled over' and that she had been 'totally humiliated' by the events leading up to the assault, known of by all in the small Katherine community.

The MP faced the Katherine Magistrate's Court on Tuesday and was fined $300 and given a good behaviour bond of $1000

But Lee was not seeking special treatment due to her role in public life, he said.

Ms Armitage said Ms Dooley was also humiliated by the attack, and had filed a domestic violence order against Lee.

'Jealousy is not an extenuating circumstance,' she said, but noted Lee was unlikely to ever commit such an offence again, had no prior criminal history and had contributed significantly to the community.

Lee was convicted of common assault and received a $1000 good behaviour bond, with no jail time to be served.

She received no conviction for the charge of disorderly conduct, but received a $300 fine along with $300 to be paid as a victims' levy.

Lee will retain her seat of Arnhem, which she won in 2012, she told reporters outside court.

'As individuals we all go through experiences that we have to overcome, it's either going to make us or break us. This situation actually made me,' she said.

'I'm a person, at the end of the day. Betrayal is something nobody wants to face; nobody wants to go home and find their niece in bed with their partner.

'I'm going to move forward from this and I look forward to my job, I look forward to representing my electorate and doing the best I can.'

She apologised to the public for her actions, saying domestic violence was never acceptable.

'People need to control their emotions better; I shouldn't have done what I've done. I'm very sorry to the public and the people of Katherine for that matter, and it will never happen again.'

The controversial politician made headlines in March and April when she and fellow Aboriginal backbenchers Alison Anderson and Francis Xavier Kurrupuwu resigned from the Country Liberals government amid claims of racism and broken promises to the bush.

Clive Palmer announced the three had joined his party just days after Ms Lee's arrest.
