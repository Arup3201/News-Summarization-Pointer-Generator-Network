It's fair to say that Friday is Grant Trebilco's favourite day of the week.

Not because it's the end of the working week but because it's the day he can suit up in his fluro gear and head out into the surf.

It may sound like fun and games but this is a project that the 33-year-old has been working on since March 2013 with a serious message behind it.

When the avid surfer found out he had bipolar disorder two years ago, it was the waves of the ocean that helped him get through his condition.

'When I got myself out there into the surf, I was able to forget about everything,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Each wave would keep me going. Being in the ocean helped me get through it. So it took one wave to give me hope again.' 

This sparked the idea for Fluro Fridays - a weekly project which was established by OneWave, Mr Trebilco's non-proft surf community.

It began in Mr Trebilco's beachside hometown Bondi, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, and since then other surfing communities across NSW have jumped on board.

However this morning, October 10, marked a special day for the event.

World Mental Health Day fell on a Friday and the OneWave community were keen to support and raise awareness for the cause.

'We had the biggest turn out today with over 200 people showing up at Bondi,' Mr Trebilco said.

'I can't believe how far it's [Fluro Fridays] come because I started it just hoping that we could help people and introduce them to surfing as a way of coping.'

He says participants dressed in fluro, like every other Friday, but this time they held hands and stood along the shoreline to create a wave.

They then held a minute silence for those who had lost their battle with mental illness. 

'All we want to do is start a critical conversation and help others to beat mental health,' Mr Trebilco said.
