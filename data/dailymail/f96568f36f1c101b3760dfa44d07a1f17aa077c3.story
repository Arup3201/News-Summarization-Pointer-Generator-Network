Hector Montoya saved his money for almost a year to buy a brand new PS4 gaming system. But after hearing a story about a mother and child dying in a fire because they didn't have a smoke detector he decided there were better investments.

Instead of the PS4, the 9-year-old took his $300 and used it to buy smoke detectors for those in need.

'I decided saving a life was more important cause one life lost is too many,' he said.

Hector Montoya decided to spend the money he'd saved for a PS4 on smoke detectors when he heard a tragic story about people who didn't have the devices

With the Grand Prairie Fire Department's help, Hector installed more than 100 smoke detectors around his Texas town.

Most of those went into the homes of elderly residents or people who reminded him of the tragic story, CBS News reported.

He credited his grandmother with the idea, as he was shocked to learn that there were people without safety systems in their homes.

'Really it just hurt my heart,' he told NBC DFW. 

Hector told reporters he'd simply start saving for the PS4 all over again.

With the help of the local fire department, Montoya was able to install more than 100 smoke detectors in the homes of the poor and elderly

Once the public heard about Hector's selfless act, he didn't need to save anymore.

Siblings Ashton and Peyton Harder saw his story on the local news and immediately wanted to pay him back.

So they went to work with their mother to buy him a PS4.

'To see a 9-year-old worrying about so many others, you cant help but want to give him what he wants,' said Ashton, 19. 'We thought he deserved something special.'

Siblings Ashton and Peyton Harder were so impressed with Hector's story they bought him a PS4

Sunday the two drove 45 minutes from Dallas to Grand Prairie to deliver the game system.

They paired it with $150 so he could keep his mission going. 

'I was really excited,' he said. 'I didn't know that this was going to happen, really I didn't, 
but I was excited when I heard.'

He was overjoyed to have new friends and to set up his new game system.

'It made me feel really good that I 
was helping him out with all of this and that we gave him extra money,' 
said Peyton, 14.

Montoya said he will continue saving and donating to those in need of smoke detectors.
