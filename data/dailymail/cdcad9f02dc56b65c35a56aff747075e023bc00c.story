Ready for battle: Model Sara McKenna is fighting with Olympic skier Bode Miller, who wants joint custody of McKenna's newborn son

Ski champion Bode Miller's ex-lover - who gave birth to his child last month - has made an appeal not to grant custody of the newborn in the latest drama to come out of a months-long custody fight.

Model Sara McKenna claimed in a court filing this week that the famed Olympic skier should not have custody of her son because he lives on a yacht and has substance abuse problems.

It's a new twist in an ugly saga between Miller, McKenna and Miller's wife, volleyball player Morgan Beck, whom Miller married late last year.

TMZ, which first reported news of the 
legal documents, reported that McKenna also claimed Miller did not want 
the child, and ask her to have an abortion.

Miller, 35, launched his fight for 
joint legal and physical custody of McKenna's child just days after Beck
 suffered a miscarriage in January.

Miller did not return a call from TMZ for comment.

Last week, McKenna filed a police report against Beck, claiming online attacks and threatening messages on Twitter.

McKenna claims that she was sent a series of online posts from Beck under different accounts that threatened her and insulted her with words like 'c***' and 'bitch.'

TMZ reported that the NYPD is taking McKenna's filing seriously, and is investigating.

At the time of Miller's custody request, McKenna
told TMZ: 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up 
my son to somebody who did not want him to begin with.'

Shortly after McKenna became pregnant last year, Miller began a romance with Beck - and the two married just months later.

Beck announced that she was pregnant and
 expecting the couple's first child together around Christmas before 
revealing several weeks later that she had lost the child.

But already the storm between the two women was brewing.

Just weeks before the wedding, McKenna posted, ‘Go take your 
paternity test already Bode. I’m over the way you have been treating us.
 You can't hide DNA in court documents.’

On
 the same day McKenna posted a message directed at 25-year-old Beck: 'If
 you make a fake Twitter to ask me questions about your new "fiance" at 
least be clever enough not to use your cat’s name #block.'McKenna,
 who describes herself as a 'Firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S 
Marine, model and Ivy Leaguer,' claims that Miller wanted 
nothing to do with the child when she first became pregnant.

Now she has made it clear that she has no intention of surrendering any rights to the child’s father.

In
 a clear show of solidarity with her husband last month, Beck 
informed McKenna: 'You are stuck with BOTH of us for the rest of your 
life.'

Miller has also 
filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support 
payments for a child by another woman - Chanel Johnson.

Johnson,
 now married, is the mother of Miller’s four-year-old daughter Neesyn 
Dacey.

According to Miller, the two are friends and he was involved in 
naming the little girl. 

Miller
 has won five Olympic medals – including a gold at the 2010 Vancouver 
Games, holds four World Championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an
 American men's record.

He 
recently announced his intention to sit this season out as he is 
recovering from knee surgery and determined to compete in the 2014 
Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

But for McKenna and Beck, the dispute has often taken a turn for the vicious, and has had an impact on mutual friendships.

In January, McKenna could be found lambasting a friend for a perceived betrayal.

Yet
 only a few months before, the women were excitedly exchanging details of
 the impending birth and telling the world how delighted they were to be
 friends.

In September @Tehren_Anaiis tweets, 'i 
am so honored to know such an amazing strong woman like 
@Sarah_A_McKenna can't wait to meet little bode babe!'

But only last month McKenna is accusing her friend of a 'back stab' by feeding information to Beck.
