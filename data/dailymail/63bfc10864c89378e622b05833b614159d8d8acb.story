Polygamist reality TV star Kody Brown has traded  his 'official' wife for the youngest of his four 'spiritual' brides.

Kody appears to live in marital bliss with his four wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn and their 17 children on TLC's show Sister Wives. 

The polygamist was only legally wed to Meri after their wedding in 1990, while the the next three were 'spiritual' or 'sister' marriages.

But it has now emerged that his first wife  has become his first ex-wife after he divorced Meri Brown last September.

The extended Brown family last year: Kody holds son Solomon, his biological child with Robyn. Fourth wife Robyn is in the black dress at back. First wife Meri is in green and white. The four wives have 17 children

And within just three months of the divorce, he had tied the knot with  wife Robyn, the youngest and most recent addition to the group.

Meri has decided to stay with Kody and his polygamist family as a spiritual wife.

According to records, the 44-year-old family head and his wife of 20 years jointly petitioned for divorce which was finalized on September 25, 2014.

It is believed that Kody wanted to bring Robyn's three kids from a previous marriage better into the family, where they'll have more security. 

She has a son Dayton and two daughters, Breanna and Aurora, from her first marriage, and her fourth child, son Solomon, is her only biological son with Kody.

On the show, all of Robyn's children refer to Kody as 'dad' and are referred to as Kody's children. Their biological father is alive and Robyn is divorced from him.

On one episode of the show she tearfully revealed she as left the marriage and was driven to financial ruin getting out of it it.

She also revealed her first child, Dayton, 15, was conceived out of wedlock despite her strong conservative beliefs. She then married his father and they had two more kids before divorcing.

It is understood Kody is marrying Robyn legally to offer more stability to her three children from her first marriage. They are pictured here in 2010, before the couple's son Solomon was born

Solomon was born at home in Robyn and Kody's Las Vegas bedroom in 2011, a year after the couple wed in Utah. 

As a Christmas present for Kody in 2013, Robyn legally changed her name to Robyn Brown from Robyn Sullivan.  

The Brown family now lives in four neighboring homes, custom built, in a cul-de-sac in Las Vegas. 

Kody wed his first three wives in quick succession. He and Meri legally and spiritually wed in 1990, he and Janelle spiritually wed in 1993 and he and Christine were married in 1994.

None of the children by his first three wives remember a time when their other two 'moms' were not part of the family. He has one child with Meri and six with Janelle and six and with Christine.

After a long period with no new wives, there was obvious friction, captured by the television cameras on the first season of Sister Wives, when Kody decided to court and then marry Robyn, bringing her and her three children into the already bursting household. 

But no wife was more supportive than Meri, who also is the closest to Robyn. 

Meri, who struggled with fertility and only has one biological child, made no secret of always yearning for more children in the family. She encouraged Kody to court Robyn.

The whole family isn't just married, they also work together for their online business, My Sister Wives Closet, which sells jewelry and knickknacks.

Some fans have expressed shock and sympathy for Meri online, but the decision is more likely to be legal maneuver due to the fact that it is still illegal to officially be married to more than one person.

Kody and his wives first appeared in Sister Wives in 2010 and said at the time they hoped the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices. 

All his wives except Janelle were raised in polygamist families. But, Janelle's mother went on to become a polygamist after her daughter, and is now in a plural marriage with Kody's dad

The series led to the Brown family being investigated for possible prosecution although Kody believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman, and the other marriages are spiritual unions. 

The Brown family belongs to the Apostolic United Brethren- a polygamous Mormon fundamentalist church within the Latter Day Saint movement.

No word yet if the divorce and new legal marriage will feature on future episodes of the family's TLC show. 

Meri encouraged Kody's courtship of and marriage to his fourth wife Robyn. Here, a still from their wedding reception which aired on TLC's SIster Wives. The ceremony itself was 'too sacred' for television
