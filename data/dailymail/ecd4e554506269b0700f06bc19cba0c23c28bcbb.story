The stock market had a swift and clear reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision to trim its stimulus efforts as stocks surged Wednesday.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 300 points to another record after the Fed decided the economy was strong enough for it to begin a modest reduction of its bond purchases.

The Federal Reserve announced today that
 it decided to reduce its stimulus efforts next month because the job 
market has shown steady improvement, opting to only buy $75billion in 
bonds as opposed to the scheduled $85billion.

'Investors should see this as a vote of confidence for the economy,' said Kristina Hooper, head of U.S. investment strategies for Allianz Global Investors.

Good sign: Federal reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday that the strong jobs numbers indicate that they need to buy fewer bonds next month as the stimulus appears to be working

The central bank also tempered the impact of its pullback by signaling that it plans to keep short-term interest rates at record lows for longer than previously thought.

Investors had long anticipated the Fed would pull back on its purchases, but did not think it would happen until next year.

Because the market had grown accustomed to stimulus, some investors had worried about a decline in stocks once the market got less rocket fuel.

Instead, the Dow jumped 292.71 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 16,167.97 - another all-time high for the blue-chip index. Shortly before the Fed announcement at 2pm, the Dow was up just 47 points.

The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 29.65 points, or 2 per cent, to 1,810.65 and the Nasdaq composite rose 46.38 points, or 1 per cent, to 4,070.06. All 10 sectors of the S&P 500 ended the day higher, with health care and banking up the most.

The rally adds to what has already been a historic run for stocks. The S&P 500 is up nearly 27 percent, its best yearly performance since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.

They feel confident enough in the months of continued job growth that chairman Ben Bernanke announced Wednesday that they will trim its $85billion a month in bond purchases by $10billion starting in January.

Noticeable spike: The Dow responded positively to the announcement, jumping up nearly 300 points immediately following Bernanke's announcement

The Fed said it could further reduce the pace of its purchases next year if the improvement continues.

The shift could lead to higher long-term borrowing rates for individuals and businesses.

At the same time, the Fed strengthened 
its commitment to record-low short-term rates. It said it plans to hold 
its key short-term rate near zero 'well past' the time when unemployment
 falls below 6.5 per cent. Unemployment is now 7 per cent.

Investors responded by sending stock prices surging more than 150 points, or nearly 1 per cent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed.

The Fed's reduction to $75billion a month in bond purchases is a small but significant step.

It means Fed policymakers are ready to ease the extraordinary support they've provided to the economy since the Great Recession began six years ago.

The move 'eliminates the uncertainty as to whether or when the Fed will taper and will give markets the opportunity to focus on what really matters, which is the economic outlook,' said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now head of monetary policy research at Cornerstone Macro.

But Perli noted that the Fed has not entirely pulled its support for the economy.

By still keeping interest rates historically low, the Fed 'will continue to remain very supportive of risky assets,' Perli said.

Positive outlook: Analysts predictions are being buoyed by four straight months of hiring increases and the unemployment rate hitting a five year low

In a policy statement released after its two-day meeting, the Fed says it will reduce its purchases of mortgage- bonds and Treasury bonds each by $5billion.

Beginning in January, it will purchase $35billion in mortgage bonds each month and $40billion in Treasurys.

The bond purchases have helped keep long-term interest rates low to encourage more borrowing and spending.

Bernanke said that he has made a practice of consulting with Yellen and that she was 'consulted closely' before the Fed voted to reduce its bond purchases.

Yellen's nomination as the next Fed chairman is expected to be confirmed soon by the Senate. Bernanke's term as chairman ends on January 31.

Responding to a question, Bernanke said that his impending departure played no role in the decision to vote on reducing the bond purchases at the December meeting.

The Fed's actions were approved on a 9-1 vote. The only member to object was Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

He called the move premature because unemployment remains high and inflation extremely low.

The Fed's action comes after encouraging reports that show the economy is accelerating.

Hiring has been robust for four straight months. Unemployment is at a five-year low of 7 per cent. Factory output is up. Consumers are spending more at retailers. Auto sales haven't been better since the recession ended 4 1/2 years ago.

What's more, the stock market is near all-time highs as inflation remains below the Fed's target rate. And the House has passed a budget plan that seems likely to avert another government shutdown next year. The Senate is expected to follow suit.

One factor of concern for some members is inflation, which remains historically low. The Fed's optimal rate is 2 per cent.

For the 12 months ending in October, consumer inflation as measured by the Fed's preferred index is just 0.7 per cent, well below its target.

On board: though Bernanke was the one to announce the trimmed stimulus, Janet Yellen is expected tp be the Fed chairwoman at the time of its implementation

But the Fed sees inflation slowly moving toward its target, according to its most recent economic projections that were released Wednesday.

The Fed projects inflation would range between 1.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent next year and could reach the Fed's target in 2015 at the earliest.

Fed officials still project economic growth of roughly 3 per cent next year. But they are slightly more optimistic about unemployment, predicting it could fall as low as 6.3 per cent in 2014, down from a low of 6.4 per cent forecast in September.
