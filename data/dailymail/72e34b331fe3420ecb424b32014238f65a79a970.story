The Buffalo Bills' home game with the New York Jets, originally scheduled for Sunday, will now be played in Detroit on Monday night after their Ralph Wilson Stadium was left covered in 220,000 tonnes of snow.

After heavy blizzards in the state of New York, Buffalo's stadium is four feet under snow and their AFC East divisional clash against the Jets will have to be played 250 miles away in Detroit.

The NFL confirmed on Thursday evening that the game would be moved from Ralph Wilson Stadium.

The Bills were initially optimistic that the game could go ahead as planned and called on volunteers to help shift the snow, offering them $10 an hour.

'All of our intention and all of our focus is 1 o'clock on Sunday,' a Bills representative said on Wednesday.

'We're just going to have to go 24/7, triple shifts, to push forward and make sure we have this place ready for Sunday,' vice president of operations and guest experience Andy Major Major added. 

'We can't have too many people helping, so there's no cutoff. We will definitely not be turning anybody away who wants to help shovel snow.'

There are currently driving bans in the area because of the severe weather and the squad were unable to train on Thursday.

But it hasn't been all doom and gloom for the players. Linebacker Kiko Alonso took the opportunity use the icy conditions to aid his recovery on Wednesday by sitting waist-deep in the snow.
