Roberto Mancini is keen to take Aleksandar Kolarov to Inter Milan.

The former Manchester City coach is also keen on Kolarov’s team-mates, Matija Nastasic and James Milner.

Mancini signed Kolarov in 2010 for £16m from Lazio yet the Serbian has never cemented his first team place in the face of competition from Gael Clichy.

Kolarov signed a new three-year deal in June and his wages will be an issue for Inter.

The 29-year-old has scored 15 times in 149 appearances for City - winning two Premier League titles, a FA Cup and a Capital One Cup.

City have been linked with Monaco left-back Layvin Kurzawa, 22, but Bayern Munich are understood to be keen on the Frenchman.
