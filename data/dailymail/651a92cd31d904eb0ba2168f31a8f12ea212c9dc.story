Ezekiel Amosu, who died after falling under a bus in Walthamstow last January

The father of a gifted student who died after being chased into the path of a bus by a gang told of his fury yesterday as three yobs were cleared of killing him.

Ezekiel Amosu, 17, fled in terror after being confronted by hooded thugs armed with wooden planks and bricks who allegedly attempted to steal his mobile phone as he walked home from a piano lesson.

The A-level student, who dreamed of studying music at Oxford University, attempted to outrun them as the gang gave chase throwing rocks at him.

A 17-year-old boy was accused of sticking out a foot to trip up Mr Amosu, causing him to fall into the path of a bus after one of the other attackers yelled: 'Stop him'.

The church-going teenager was crushed under the wheels of the bus and died instantly on January 24 last year.

But this week the 17-year-old defendant was cleared of manslaughter after claiming that the victim ran into him and tripped up by accident.

Two other teenagers aged 13 and 16 were also cleared at the Old Bailey, while two boys aged 16 and 17 were convicted of manslaughter.

Yesterday the victim's father Bon Amosu, 70, said the family were devastated by the verdicts.

He paid tribute to his son, who was in the top sets for his A-levels at Leyton Sixth Form College and had ambitions to study music at Oxford, following in the footsteps of his sister Rachel, who won a Fulbright scholarship to Washington University after graduating from Oxford.

She now lives in Rio de Janeiro, where she has launched a successful music career.

Mr Amosu said: 'We are not looking for revenge, vengeance belongs to God, but we were looking for a deterrent.

'A deterrent would have meant taking them off the streets and putting them in prison. In prison they would at least have had a chance to change their ways and rethink their lives.

'Instead three of them will be back out on the streets and they will probably do something like this again because they think they can get away with it.

'I feel sorry for the next family who go through what we have been through.

'In a way I feel sorry for those boys. One of them was just 13, what an age to live like that.' He told the Evening Standard: 'Next month he would be going to university.

'He had set his heart on that and I have no doubt he was going to succeed. He was the youngest of my children and the tallest, he was great fun to be around, and we will never forget him.

'I do not believe that those boys wanted to kill Ezekiel, but their actions resulted in his death.

'But they are the losers. Ezekiel would have made music they would have enjoyed, but now they haven't got that. Now there's only silence.' Prosecutors alleged that the gang had tried to mug the victim and his friends, but the defendants were cleared of attempted robbery.

Ezekiel's friend who is now 18, described the moment they were attacked in Walthamstow, East London.

He said: 'They were asking Ezekiel questions, and the one with the plank goes, “ah, I feel like a bully” and asked Ezekiel what phone has he got, and the other two were kind of hyping it - just trying to big it up.

'Then I ran because I was panicking - I just ran.

'When I got home I got a phone call saying one of them guys pushed Ezekiel in front of a bus.'

The victim, who loved music and basketball, was described by friends as the 'kindest guy known to anyone' in tributes on Facebook after his death.

The first trial collapsed in January this year when a 13-year-old prosecution witness texted the defendants to arrange to change his evidence.

It emerged that he had also told his stepmother that he agreed the robbery could go ahead if he got a 'cut' of the proceeds.

On Monday, the 13-year-old was cleared of manslaughter, two charges of attempted robbery and perverting the course of justice but was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

A 17 year-old boy was convicted of manslaughter and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

He was cleared of two charges of attempted robbery and perverting the course of justice.

A second 17-year-old, who was accused of tripping up Ezekiel, was cleared of manslaughter and walked free from court.

A 16-year-old was convicted of manslaughter but acquitted of two charges of attempted robbery, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perverting the course of justice.

Another 16 year-old was acquitted of manslaughter, two charges of attempted robbery, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perverting the course of justice.

The three convicted youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will be sentenced next month.
