Chris Algieri was overweight when he took to the scales in the early hours Macau time for his fight with Manny Pacquiao.

The New York challenger was four ounces over the 10st4lb catchweight limit set for this world welterweight title fight.

Algieri removed his shorts and a necklace to stand naked on the scales behind some shirts to cover his modesty for world television.

But even then, he was still two ounces over and was given two hours to remove that slight surplus.

There was little doubt that he would make the weight, but it was a strange lapse for a man who holds the world light-welterweight title, and asked questions of his allegedly rigorous training regime.

Pacquiao, ever the ultimate professional, was half a pound inside the limit.

Several hundred fans had queued from five in the morning to see the weigh-in at the Cotai Arena at 8 am Saturday morning Macau time.

Many were from among the more than 5,000 Filipinons who have made the 90 minute trip by plane to support Pacquiao. 

Algieri returned to the scales after a 50-minute interval and had trimmed down to two ounces lighter than Pacquiao at 10st 3lb 6oz.

When asked if Algieri had trained properly, Pacquiao’s fabled trainer Freddie Roach replied: ‘No.’

Algieri blamed his problem on the scales, sayng: 'I had my usual breakfast of oats and eggs over medium and was under the limit on these same scales at a try-out before the official weigh-in.

'Somethng must have happened to them as they were moved to the arena.'

Roach was unimpressed, saying: 'So Manny came in exactly as we planned and told you, at half a pound under. But the scales were off for Algieri?'

He added, with irony: 'And this is they guy who has a master degree in nutrition as part of his medical studies?'

None of the undercard fighters failed to make their weights.
