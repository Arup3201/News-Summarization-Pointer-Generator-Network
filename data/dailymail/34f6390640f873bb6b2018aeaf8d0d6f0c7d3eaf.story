Many people would find it an attractive way to spend time - getting paid for playing Call of Duty or spending your life trying to break the record for the most number of goals scored in a game of FIFA.

Will Johnson, 21, of Arkansas, has earned a whopping £83,000 from playing the first-person shooter, while Jacob Gaby, 15, of Bushey, Hertfordshire, achieved a gigantic 189-0 win on the football game.

They are record-breakers with Brett Martin, 31, of Colorado, who has 8,030 pieces of video game merchandise, and Mark Slevinsky, 30, of Alberta, Canada, creator of the smallest arcade machine.

Reached his goal: Jacob Gaby, 15, of Bushey, Hertfordshire, managed a gigantic 189-0 win on the FIFA football game, as Barcelona against Fulham. He plays the game for around seven hours a week

Target: Will Johnson, 21, of Arkansas, became the Highest Earning Call of Duty Player after making £83,000 from winning four titles on the Major League Gaming Pro Circuit between 2009 and 2012

Jacob, who broke the record for the Highest Margin of Victory against the Computer on FIFA, came up with the idea while playing with his brother - and is on the game for around seven hours per week.

‘I never went out to achieve a record,’ he said. ‘I was just sat playing the game with my brother. We were bored, so he challenged me to see how many goals I could score against the computer.’

‘By half time I had scored over 100. It was pretty mad. My brother couldn’t believe it - he told me to keep going as there must be a record. By the final whistle I had scored 189 goals.’

But the parents of Jacob, who was playing as Barcelona against Fulham on the FIFA 12 version of the game, will not let the win go to his head.

‘They want me to concentrate on my schoolwork as I’ve got major exams coming up,’ he said. Jacob played two 20 minute halves on the game - so he averaged scoring nearly five goals a minute.

Impressive: Brett Martin, 31, of Colorado, who has 8,030 pieces of videogame merchandise, was given his first item - a Super Mario figure - by his parents aged just eight. Now he holds a world record

Miniscule: The Smallest Arcade Machine - created by computer engineer Mark Slevinsky, 30, of Alberta, Canada - took six months to design and build, and stands at a tiny 4.88 by 2.05 by 2.36 inches

Mr Johnson - known as ‘BigTymer’ - became the Highest Earning Call of Duty Player after making £83,000 from winning four titles on the Major League Gaming Pro Circuit between 2009 and 2012. 

He said ‘it’s perfect to have solid proof that I am the best in the world at a craft I’ve spent years working on’, but added that he may have to cut down his game time ‘or I risk losing my girlfriend’.

Another record-breaker is web designer Mr Martin, who has the Largest Collection of Videogame Memorabilia. He got his first item - a Super Mario figure - from his parents aged eight.

He only started collecting 12 years ago when he began using eBay, but has since amassed a collection worth more than £62,000. ‘My kids love the collection,’ Mr Martin said. ‘My wife is tolerant.’

He added: ‘Many of my friends know I’m a gamer, but I guess after this they’ll realise just how passionate and obsessed I am.’

Driver: Another person to be recognised is Jann Mardenborough, of Wales, who became the Youngest GT (Gran Turisimo) Academy Winner - an initiative set up by car maker Nissan and the Sony PlayStation

Wheely quick: Leyla Hasso, who holds the record for the world's fastest female Super Mario Kart player

At the other end of the scale, the Smallest Arcade Machine - created by computer engineer Mr Slevinsky - took six months to design and build, and stands at a tiny 4.88 by 2.05 by 2.36 inches.

'My wife and I are expecting our first child (a son) any day now. He’ll be the right size to play the arcade machine'

‘My wife and I are expecting our first child (a son) any day now,’ the designer said. ‘He’ll be the right size to play the arcade machine.’

Mr Slevinsky added: ‘There are all the same parts as a real, full-size arcade machine. It's got a joystick, a display, a motherboard, a power supply... there is no coin slot though.’

Another to be recognised was Jann Mardenborough, 21, of Cardiff, who became the Youngest GT (Gran Turisimo) Academy Winner - an initiative set up by car maker Nissan and the Sony PlayStation.

FC Barcelona: Jacob, who broke the record for the Highest Margin of Victory against the Computer on FIFA, came up with the idea while playing with his brother

Big money: Mr Johnson earned a whopping £83,000 from playing first-person shooter Call of Duty

It gives player a chance to drive a 
professional racing car - and Mr Mardenborough has since got his 
international racing licence. He now drives for Nissan in the Blancpain 
Endurance Series.

He wanted to be a racing 
car driver when he was younger, and was called a 'natural' by the owner 
of a kart circuit aged eight - but the costs were too high, so he turned to video games instead.

Other impressive feats, which are being recognised in the Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition 2013, include Canada’s Chris Gloyd and Timothy Bell - who achieved the Longest Gaming Marathon.

The pair lasted an astonishing 120 hours and 7 minutes on the Resistance first-person shooter series.  

John Bates, 85, of Wisconsin, proved that age is no factor as he was recorded as having achieved over 14,000 perfect games on Wii Sports Bowling, making him the Oldest Gaming Record Holder.  

Kevin Lynch - who worked on the book, which is out today - said: ‘It’s been a fantastic year for gaming, with incredible records broken by players from all walks of life.’
