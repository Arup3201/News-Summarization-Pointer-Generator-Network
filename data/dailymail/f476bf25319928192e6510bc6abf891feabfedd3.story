Kid Galahad, Sheffield's fast-rising super-bantamweight, has won the Young Boxer of the Year award, which will be presented by the Boxing Writers' Club at their annual dinner at The Savoy in London next month. 

The 24-year-old secured the IBF youth title on Saturday after beating Adeilson Dos Santos, winning almost every round in the fight in the process.

As a result Galahad has now won 18 successive fights since turning professional in 2009. 

Kid Galahad celebrates winning his IBF youth title after brushing aside Adeilson Dos Santos on Saturday

Galahad is one of the most talented super-bantamweight fighters in the UK

Speaking after the fight to Channel 4 Galahad said: 'He was a dangerous opponent, young and dangerous and I couldn't let him settle but I took him apart from the get-go. 

'It was a good display I'll give myself 8/10. I did some things wrong but I'm still learning.

'I don't think Scott Quigg will ever fight me but Carl Frampton, December 6, we've got a date and I'll happily fight him on that date if he wants to defend his title.'

As well as his recent triumphs Galahad was the British super-bantamweight champion last September and the European super-bantamweight champion in March.
