A decomposing body has been found in the trunk of a car has been identified as Gianni Belvedere, 24.

Mr Belvedere's younger brother, Salvatore, 22, and Gianni's fiance, Illona Flint, 22, were shot dead in their car outside a San Diego shopping mall on December 24.

Gianni Belvedere had not been seen since the killings until last weekend when his body was discovered in the trunk of his green Toyota Camry, around 100 miles from San Diego.

Found: The body found last week in a Riverside parking lot has been identified as 24-year-old Gianni Belvedere of San Diego, Riverside police said

Investigation: An autopsy determined that Belvedere, who had been missing since the Christmas Eve murders of his fiancée and brother at a Mission Valley mall, was the victim of a homicide. The body was identified through fingerprints

Investigators had been looking for Belvedere and his dark-green 2004 Toyota Camry with Utah license plates since the Tierrasanta resident’s younger brother and fiancee were found shot to death at Westfield Mission Valley.

San Diego police did not name Belvedere as a suspect in the killings of Salvatore Belvedere and Ilona Flint, both 22, but listed him as a missing person at risk.

The last known sighting of the older brother was in Mission Valley about three hours before the shootings at the mall, authorities said.

Dead: Gianni Belvedere's body (left) was found last weekend in the trunk of his car. He had not been seen since the triple murders that included Gianni's fiancee Ilona Flint and his younger brother, Salvatore Belvedere. They were found shot dead in a San Diego mall parking lot on Christmas Eve

Police discovered the body of a man in the trunk of missing Gianni Belvedere's car this weekend after a passerby called about a strong odor

Witness Gabby Alcarez told ABC that she called police because '[T]he odor is pretty strong, like when I passed by it'.

A recently-released audio tape of a 911 call that Miss Flint managed to make before she died from her wounds gave police other details on a suspect. 

She told an emergency dispatcher that 
she didn't know precisely where she was but that she was near the 
Westfield Mission Valley Mall.

Both victims were hit in the head and torso as they sat in a black sedan outside a Macy's store in the early hours of Christmas Eve.

The audio tape identifies an individual who left the scene in a 2008/2011 dark gray Honda Civic.

San Diego police are baffled by the crime for which they have no motive and no suspects. 

The family of Miss Flint released a statement today which read: 'We consider Gianni Belvedere to be our 
son as much as the Belvederes consider Ilona to be their daughter.

Death of friends: Ilona Flint (right) managed to make a 911 call after being shot, but died moments later. Salvatore Belvedere died in a hospital several days later

Found: Gianni Belevedere's body was found in the trunk of his own Toyota Camry

Ilona Flint, 22, and the little brother of her fiancé Salvatore Belvedere, 22, died from gunshot wounds after being attacked outside this San Diego mall

'The Belvedere and Flint-Jones families thank the media
 for respecting our privacy during this difficult time.'

Lt
 Mike Hastings from the San Diego police department's homicide unit said
 in December that they are looking for a 5ft 9 to 5ft 11 male of unknown
 race, last seen dressed in a shirt and tan pants.

Anyone
 with information is asked to call the San Diego Police Department's 
Homicide Unit on (619) 531-2293 or San Diego County Crime Stoppers at

Shot: Flint, who worked at a store in the mall, was being picked up by the younger Belvedere brother, San Diego police said. The pair, both 22, were sitting in a car when they were shot multiple times

Tragic: The shooting took place in the car park of a Macy's store early on Christmas Eve morning
