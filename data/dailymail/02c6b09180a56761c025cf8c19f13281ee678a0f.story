A man charged with having sex with a 12-year-old girl whom he 'married' in NSW is set to be sentenced next year.

There was a long silence at Sydney's District Court on Friday when the 27-year-old, who cannot be named, was asked to stand and formally enter a plea.

The man has been charged with having sexual intercourse with the girl on at least three occasions between January 11 and February 5 this year at Raymond Terrace in the Hunter and elsewhere in NSW.

A 27-year-old man, pictured at Burwood Local Court in May, has formerly pleaded guilty in Sydney's District Court on Friday to having sexual intercourse with the girl on at least three occasions

The Entrance to the Downing Centre, Sydney's District Court, where the man formally entered a plea on Friday

After he failed to get a response from the man, Judge Norman Delaney said: 'I will ask the question again, `How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?''

'Guilty', the man eventually replied through an interpreter.

Police allege the man married the girl in an Islamic ceremony in January. 

The man has had his student visa cancelled and is now in immigration detention in Villawood.

The girl's father has also been charged over the 'marriage', with the court hearing the 27-year-old is due to give evidence at a trial into the matter next year. 

The 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, is set to be sentenced next year.

Police allege he organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'.

He has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14.

Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 27-year-old student at a mosque last year after he approached her father and asked to meet her.

Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony.

The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege.

A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home.

The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500 after.

In court documents it is claimed that since the marriage the pair engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis until February when their relationship was discovered by a Centrelink worker, when the man tried to get registered as the girl's legal guardian in order to obtain welfare benefits.

'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states.
