Thousands of villagers in the Philippines are being evacuated in response to warnings that an active volcano is set to erupt.

Mount Mayon, located in the east of the Philippines, will experience a 'hazardous eruption' within weeks, warned the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.

The volcano is already experiencing an ongoing gentle eruption, as lava fragments flow down the slope of Mount Mayon, prompting authorities to enforce the evacuation.

Increased restlessness in the mountain was recorded on Thursday night, with nearly four times the amount of lava fragments and boulders rolling down from Mayon’s crater.

These levels indicate that the lava dome has breached the south-eastern side of the volcano, coming on the heels of volcanic gas and molten lava which are making the crater red, creating a glow which can be seen at night. 

The volcano shows 'a noticeable escalation of unrest,' said the Philippine Volcanology and Seismology Institute, as the number of low-frequency volcanic earthquakes has also increased.

More than 10,000 people have been evacuated so far as the Institute has further raised the alert level to 'critical' for the mountain, the agency's third highest alert level after eruption and imminent eruption. 

Renato Solidum, who heads the government’s volcano monitoring agency said, 'It’s already erupting, but not explosive.'

The volcano has erupted 50 times over the past 500 years, threatening local towns

Large white crosses have been erected by villagers at the entrance of their neighbourhoods, in the hope that they will protect them from harm.

'Currently, the activity is just lava coming down. If there is an explosion, all sides of the volcano are threatened.'

The mayor of close-by farming town Santo Domingo told ABC News that his village had previously been adversely affected by Mount Mayon. 

In 1987 Mayon erupted with pyroclastic flows, which equates to fast-flowing volcanic debris and super-heated gas which destroys everything it comes into contact with, almost decimating the population.

'We are praying that it would not be the worst-case scenario,' Aguas said, noting that only 10% of residents in his town had started to evacuate. 

The mountain is a popular tourist site, located 340 km from the capital of Manila, in the coconut producing province of Albay.

It has erupted 50 times in the past 500 years, the most recent of which was in 2013. Five climbers, including three German tourists were killed when ash spewed suddenly from the volcano.
