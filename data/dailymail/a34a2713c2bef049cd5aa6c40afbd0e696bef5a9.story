Drivers in the UK are being short changed when it comes to motoring, with the country being named as the most expensive place on earth to run a car.

Soaring costs of fuel, insurance, road tax and repair bills mean that it now costs British drivers £3,453 every year to run their vehicles.

The cost of running an average family car in the UK costs £1,000 more than in the USA and 
Australia, £1,825 than Japan and a staggering £2,000 more than in 
China.

Cost of motoring: Comparing the cost of fuel, insurance, road tax and MOT, on average it costs the British drivers £3,453 a year to run their vehicles, which is £1,000 more than in the USA and Australia

The survey, carried out by 
Webuyanycar.com, compared the cost of motoring, including the price of 
fuel, insurance, road tax and MOT in 21 countries on five 
continents.

And the study and revealed that on many fronts the UK motorist is paying 
more than anyone else, with only those in the Netherlands and Switzerland coming close.

Dutch drivers pay out £3,370.42, the Swiss  £3,321.80, although in China this figure is just £1,315.12 and in Saudi Arabia just £237.22.

While many drivers regularly complain 
about the cost of re-filling their cars at the fuel pumps, it would 
appear they have some justification, with the bulk of the cost of 
running a car stemming from petrol or diesel.

Based on an annual mileage of 12,500, the average UK driver will spend £2,256 a year on fuel.

It means we shell out an average of 27p for every mile.

However, just across the channel in France it would cost £2,078.

And it is little wonder that the great American road trip conjures up such warm feelings when you consider the cost of fuel for a year in the States is a measly £990, which works out at around 8p a mile.

In oil-rich Saudi Arabia, where fuel can cost as little as 7p per litre, a year of filling up the tank could cost as little as £129.

British drivers are also being hit hard when it comes to road tax, with the survey calculating that the average cost in this country is £225 a year.

This is seven times the amount paid by 
drivers in Switzerland, Spain and Russia, while those in Canada, South 
Africa and New Zealand do not have to fork out for road tax at all.

There is some good news for British drivers however; recent falls in the cost of car insurance mean that the UK average premium of £667 is on a par with countries such as the USA and Canada plus European nations like Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.

That also puts UK drivers well ahead of Switzerland where the average premium is a massive £1,200, although more than France, Spain and Australia where drivers pay less than £400 a year.

In Australia the average cost of insurance £383, in Spain, £350, while in France the average is just £286.

Other expenses include maintenance and 
repairs, the cost of which has crept up as many modern cars are too 
complicated for DIY mechanics to fix on their own.

Road to ruin: These drivers on the M1 will pay an average of £2,256 per year for fuel, which works out at around 27p per mile

Expense: With petrol prices rising it is no surprise that the bulk of the cost of running a car comes from fuel

Richard Evans, head of technical services for webuyanycar.com, said: 'Most of us don’t stop to think how much each journey in the car actually costs and as the price of fuel, insurance, road tax and MOTs have all crept up in recent years, the total is now a massive outlay for the average household.'

The new figures have prompted calls for Chancellor George Osborne to cut the cost of fuel duty in next month's Autumn Statement.

The FairFuelUK campaign co-founder Howard Cox said many drivers end up spending an incredible 15 per cent of their income on fuel, with the Treasury taking 60per cent of what drivers put into their tax on duty and VAT.

'In a recent FairFuelUK poll of 25,000 
supporters, more than 87 per cent said that their cost of living is 
worse when compared to 12 months ago because of the high cost of petrol 
and diesel,' he told the Daily Express.
