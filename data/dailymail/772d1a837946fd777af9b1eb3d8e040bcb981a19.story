She has already moved on just two months after divorcing her husband of 23 years, Bruce Jenner.

But now, Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner, 59, has been warned about the disturbing past of her new boyfriend Corey Gamble, who at 33-years-old, is young enough to be her son.

Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan, 43, - who dated Corey for three years - has labelled him a 'money-hungry opportunist' and even claims he became violent after they split in 2010, in a new interview with InTouch.

'Watch out, Kris': Jenner, 59, is warned over her 33-year-old boyfriend Corey Gamble (pictured here last month) ...as he branded a 'money hungry opportunist' by his ex

'I know Corey. He's all about power and money and will do whatever it takes to get it,' Sheree tells the publication.

Corey is said to work as a road manager for Justin Bieber, and Sheree suggests that he is somewhat of a social climber.

'He sees the Kardashians as media's first family,' she says, and adds that Kris is not even his type.

What she knows: Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan, 43, - who dated Corey for three years - has labelled him a 'money-hungry opportunist in a new interview with InTouch 

Disturbing past: InTouch Weekly revealed this temporary protection order that Sheree was granted against Corey, after he allegedly became violent with her 

'Khloe is more his type. Kris is a little too old. But with her power and money, Kris could have been Betty White and Corey would still have hit on her!'

Worryingly, InTouch have also obtained court documents that show how Sheree took out a protection order against Corey in 2010, after he allegedly 'grabbed and bruised her' after they had split.

Kris recently said she felt 'so blessed' to have celebrated her 59th birthday with new boyfriend Corey.

That's a bit awkward: Corey's ex claims that Kris Jenner is 'too old' for him and says her daughter Khloé Kardashian is 'more his type'

She flew to Las Vegas to host a special party at 1Oak nightclub earlier this month and was thrilled to have her new toyboy and a small entourage, including her daughter Kourtney Kardashian's boyfriend Scott Disick, by her side.

Asked about the gifts she received, she said: 'I'm always so blessed to have such great friends and great gifts, but you know the thing that matters to me the most as the years tick on is just being with friends and family, and being so appreciative of the life that I have. It's delicious.'

Kris began dating Corey last month and he is the first person she has romanced since splitting from Bruce Jenner, 64, in October 2013 after 23 years of marriage.

Kris is said to have become romantically involved with him following a Mexican getaway.

A source told E! News earlier this month: 'What started off as a friendship has turned romantic, but it's all very new.'

The couple didn't seem worried about hiding their blossoming romance as they arrived back in California following their trip and were spotted looking 'loved-up' at the airport in Van Nuys at the time.

A source said: 'They looked like a loved-up couple. In the brief time they were loading up luggage, Corey put his arm around Kris and she reached out to hold his hand.'

The pair are thought to have met through mutual friends at fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday in Ibiza in August.
