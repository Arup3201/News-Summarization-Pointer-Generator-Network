The judge who led the inquiry into mass murderer Harold Shipman is to head a BBC review into the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Dame Janet Smith will speak to the star’s victims and explore whether the ‘culture and practices’ at the broadcaster ‘enabled the sexual abuse of children to continue unchecked’.

Former Sky News chief Nick Pollard has been appointed separately to investigate the decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Savile and to see if ‘inappropriate managerial pressure’ was applied.

reviews stemming from the Jimmy Savile sex abuse allegations

A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them

A third independent review will look into sexual harassment claims which have surfaced in recent weeks.

The Smith Review will see Dame Janet 
investigate how much other staff knew of Savile’s predatory behaviour 
and speak to those who claimed to have raised concerns within the BBC at
the time.

She will then consider whether the 
corporation’s current child protection and whistle-blowing policies are 
‘fit for purpose’ and what lessons need to be learned.

The Pollard Review will establish 
whether there were any failings in the BBC’s management of the Newsnight
investigation, and will consider whether the scheduled broadcasts of 
tributes to the dead presenter had any impact on the decision to drop 
the BBC2 probe.

It will also look at how the 
broadcaster handled material ‘derived from the investigation’ which 
could have been of interest to police.

Announcing the inquiries, the BBC’s 
senior independent director,  Dame Fiona Reynolds, said: ‘These reviews 
will demonstrate the BBC’s determination to open itself fully to 
scrutiny from independent experts, emphasising our belief that the basis
of the public’s trust is full openness and accountability.’

Dame Janet, 71, previously led the 
multi-million pound Shipman Inquiry, which examined the activities of 
the Manchester GP who was convicted of killing 15 elderly patients and 
suspected of murdering hundreds more.

News of the BBC’s inquiries came as ministers said they may order a full independent inquiry into the scandal.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told
MPs there was ‘certainly a case for an inquiry’ into the ‘deeply 
shocking and troubling revelations’.

A senior Tory MP added that the BBC’s
new director-general, George Entwistle, had questions to answer about 
why he commissioned tributes to Savile at a time when serious 
allegations about his conduct were being investigated by Newsnight.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the 
culture, media and sport committee which will quiz Mr Entwistle about 
the scandal next week, described his apparent lack of curiosity about 
Newsnight’s findings as ‘very surprising’.

‘You would expect that if he was told
that Newsnight was looking at Jimmy Savile that he would have asked 
what it was about in order to avoid precisely the kind of embarrassment 
the BBC is now in,’ he said.

‘If it was shown that he was aware, 
particularly when he has told a press conference that he wasn’t, then I 
think that would put him in a very difficult position.’

MPs will also question Mr Entwistle about the BBC’s decision to shelve the Newsnight investigation.

Mr Clegg said a wide-ranging police 
investigation should take precedence – but suggested a wider inquiry may
also be needed if a series of internal BBC reviews fail to quell public
disquiet about the scandal.

Police believe the DJ and television presenter's alleged catalogue of sex abuse could have spanned six decades

‘I constantly ask myself how on earth
is this possible on such a scale over such a long period of time in so 
many different settings,’ he said.

‘It is in many ways the sort of 
thing, the dark side of the cult of celebrity which maybe intimidated 
people from speaking out earlier.’

Mr Clegg’s intervention came as MPs, 
including Labour leader Ed Miliband, warned that the BBC could not be 
left to investigate claims that senior managers turned a blind eye to 
allegations that Savile was abusing young women and children, sometimes 
on BBC property.

Tory MP Philip Davies, a fellow 
member of the Commons culture committee, last night urged the media 
watchdog Ofcom to investigate whether the BBC remained a ‘fit and proper
organisation to hold a broadcasting licence’ in the light of the 
allegations.

In a letter to Ofcom’s chief 
executive Ed Richards, he said it was ‘inconceivable that nobody in 
senior positions [at the BBC] was aware of the allegations surrounding 
Savile or other inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour’.

Labour’s Harriet Harman will meet Mr 
Entwistle today to warn him that any inquiries into the scandal must 
look at the role played by managers and presenters, and must consider 
whether rules on sexual harassment are tough enough to prevent a repeat.
