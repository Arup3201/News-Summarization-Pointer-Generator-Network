A Briton was on the run in Cambodia last night after police named him as the prime suspect in the murder of a local woman found with her throat slashed.

The naked body of the 20-year-old was found under a bed at the £12-a-night Bolyna Palace Hotel in the capital Phnom Penh.

Police said they were searching for James Green, who is believed to still be in the country.

Inspector Seng Kosal said: ‘British citizen James Green is the primary suspect in the murder.’

Referring
 to Green and the victim, he added: ‘They checked into the hotel on 
Christmas Day. She was killed by stab wounds and cuts on her throat and 
neck.

‘After the killing, 
the suspect took the mattress to cover her body and hid her under the 
bed in the hotel room. She was found by a hotel cleaner.’

The hotel said Green checked in as Stuart James Green, and left on December 28 without paying.

A shocked cleaner found the woman's body when she went into the room as part of her morning routine.

'So far, we do not know exactly the reason for the victim's murder,' said the inspector.

'We are now seeking the suspect in order to bring him to justice and punish him under Cambodian law.'

The newspaper said an employee at the Bolyna Palace, who asked to remain anonymous, said that Mr Green had checked into the hotel on December 25, bringing with him a young woman to stay the night in his room.

'On December 28, 2013, at about 11pm, he asked to get his passport from the hotel receptionist and said that he was taking it to get money from the bank in order to pay for his hotel room.

'But on that night he left the hotel without paying any money for his room fee.'

The employee added that when Mr Green did not return the following day, a cleaner went into the room and found the body of the young woman. The police were immediately called in, but there was no sign of the Briton in the vicinity.

No-one has been available for comment on the British Embassy.

It is understood police feared that at first Mr Green, having picked up his passport from the hotel, may have tried to leave the country by air on December 29.

It is believed no record has been found of him leaving from the airport and a watch has been placed on road crossings into neighbouring countries of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.

Vietnam requires a visa in advance, a visa can be obtained for Laos at the border for a fee and Thailand - the easiest country to enter - gives a free 30-day visa.

The Bolyna Palace, where rooms are available for about £12 a night, has received mixed reviews from travellers, some who say they have been satisfied with the accommodation, others warning tourists not to stay there because there are no windows in the rooms and the place is 'dirty'.
