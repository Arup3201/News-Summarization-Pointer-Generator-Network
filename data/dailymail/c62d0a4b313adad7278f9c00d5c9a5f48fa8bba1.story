Former England youth international and Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has signed for newly-promoted Russian Premier League outfit FC Ufa.

The 22-year-old was released by Barnsley at the end of last season and has decided to try to resurrect his career abroad.

Having come through the ranks at Arsenal, Frimpong represented England at Under-17 level - although he would go on to play for Ghana's senior team - and was seen as a hot prospect and a future star of the Gunners' midfield.

He was loaned out to Wolves but suffered a serious knee injury early into his time in the Black Country and returned to Arsenal. Since then he has spent short spells at Fulham and Charlton before a permanent move to Barnsley.

The move did not last as Frimpong was allowed to leave the Tykes - with Ufa, who sit 11th in the Premier League table, confirming they have signed the player:
