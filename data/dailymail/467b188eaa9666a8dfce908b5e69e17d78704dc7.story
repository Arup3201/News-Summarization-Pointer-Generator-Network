Suspect: James Leslie, pictured, was arrested by police in connection with the shooting after a seven-hour search

A woman police officer shot at point-blank range by a gunman was on only her second shift in a new job.

The 33-year-old officer was shot through a door without warning after responding to reports of a disturbance at the house in the early hours of yesterday morniing.

She had only recently become a response officer following her request to be given a more exciting role.

The officer, who was wearing body armour, is in hospital suffering from serious injuries to her face, neck and hand but police say her injuries are not life-threatening.

A male colleague dragged her from the scene and raised the alarm as the gunman fled on a mountain bike.

She and her colleague were dispatched to the address in Headingley, Leeds, on the 'routine' call - to do with anti-social behaviour -Â  when the shooting happened at 4am.

Though the injured woman is an 'experienced officer' who has been in the force for some years, she had recently switched from neighbourhood policing.

James Leslie, 37, was arrested by heavily-armed officers in connection with the shooting after a seven-hour manhunt.

He was arrested outside Shire Oak Primary School in Wood Lane, Headingley, where a sawn-off shotgun was recovered.

Kieran Williams, 17, said he had a row with the suspect yesterday and a women police officer 
called round to take information from his housemates during the night 
after a bottle was thrown through their window.

He said he later heard multiple shots.

The
teenager said the suspect came to his house, which backs on to the scene of 
the shooting, complaining that someone was shining a torch through his 
window.

'He was shouting his mouth off and all that. That
argument died down but he was carrying on for about five or six hours. He was going on and on and on.'

Evidence: The gun allegedly used by James Leslie was dumped on the floor outside a primary school when he was arrested

Row: Kieran Williams, near the scene at Cardigan Road, said he had been in a row with Lesley on Tuesday night

He went to bed but was woken by a loud bang at between 2.30am and 3am when a bottle was thrown through his window.

He
said that at about 3.30am he heard 'one clean shot'.

He said the police had come round earlier to talk to the people in the house about the broken window.

Resident Ro Tabrez, 21, said: 'I was half asleep when all of a sudden there was a loud bang which sounded like somebody slamming a garage door shut.

'There was a ten second gap and then another two or three loud bangs followed. It was enough to wake me up fully.

'I didn't think much about it at the time, as it's a student area, so there's always noise around here at all times during the night and day, and the last thing you'd think would be a gunshot.'

Speaking
at the scene, Chief Superintendent Paul Money said the female officer 
suffered 'serious' injuries to her face, neck and right hand.

'Her condition is described as poorly but stable and not life-threatening,' he said.

'Her colleague, her male colleague, was uninjured but thankfully was able to provide immediate care and remove the injured officer from harm's way and also summon assistance from other officers.

'Additional officers were dispatched to the scene and earlier this morning, as a consequence of support from those officers and from members of the public, the suspect has been arrested.

'A firearm has also been recovered.

'This is quite obviously an incident that is thankfully rare in Leeds but nonetheless very shocking.'He said police were in control of the situation 'very quickly'.

'We are not looking for anybody else in connection with this incident,' he said.

'Officers are still deployed in this community, reassuring people.'

Arrest: Police descended on Wood Lane, close to where the shooting happened and arrested the wanted man close to a primary school

Scene: Two officers attended a disturbance call at 4am today on Cardigan Road (pictured) in the Hyde Park area of Leeds when they were attacked, which is being guarded by armed officers today

Office worker Ash Hayden told MailOnline he saw Leslie arrested after armed police pinned him to the ground close to his office.

'We heard the helicopter circling and then there were shouts from police telling a man to get on the floor.

'There were six police cars and the sound of dogs barking. Obviously they were using them to hunt for him.'

Assistant
Chief Constable Geoff Dodd said: 'Officers made an arrest at 10.10am on
Wood Lane, Leeds, and I can confirm that we have recovered a firearm.

'This followed information provided to us by a member of the public that a man fitting the description had been seen nearby.

'The
officer has sustained a very serious injury and her wellbeing is of 
paramount importance to us. The thoughts of colleagues remain with the 
officer and her family at this very difficult time.

'It is right 
to say that incidents where police officers face threat from firearms 
are thankfully very rare but that does not lessen the shocking impact 
when an officer is injured in such a way.'

Manhunt: Police used a team of armed officers, dogs and a helicopter to hunt for Leslie, whom they urged to give himself up before he was caught

Police presence: Officers hunting for Leslie cordoned off this house on Cardigan Road, which was photographed this morning by Graham Carr, who works across the road

After the shooting Mr Leslie was last seen he was on a bicycle heading towards Victoria Road away from Cardigan Road.

Ned Liddemore, vice chairman of the Police Federation, said: 'This was a cowardly attack on two unarmed police officers dealing with a so-called 'routine' call.

'As has been shown in the early hours of this morning, there is no such thing as a routine call when it comes to police officers.

'We will be supporting the officers and their families through this traumatic time.'

Location: The incident happened at a property set back from Cardigan Road, marked with the red dot, which is close to the Headingley cricket ground in the north-west of Leeds. The suspect was found in Wood Lane, marked with a green dot, this morning
