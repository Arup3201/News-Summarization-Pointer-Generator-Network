While workers waited half an hour for the heavy-lifting equipment to arrive, they kept talking to the trapped woman, making sure she was conscious.

'We and traffic officers at scene immediately called for help, asking to call in a lifting crane and an excavator,' said fire commander Zhu Lei.

Somehow the passenger managed to avoid being crushed by the falling lorry, but was trapped in the wreckage after the cement mixer toppled

Fire crews initially tried to use jacks to lift the lorry, but after it proved too heavy they were forced to call for a crane which took 30 minutes to arrive

Fire crew continued taking to the woman while waiting for the heavy-lifting equipment to arrive, making sure she did not lose consciousness

'During that time, we kept talking to the woman, making sure she is awake and in a clear mind.'

After the mixer had been moved, firemen were able to cut the woman out of the crumpled car and move her into a waiting ambulance.

She was taken to hospital where she was reported to be in a stable condition, but with several broken bones.  

After the lorry was lifted away fire crews used power tools to cut the passenger free from the wreckage before lifting her free

Incredibly the woman suffered only a few broken bones and was put into a waiting ambulance before being taken to hospital
