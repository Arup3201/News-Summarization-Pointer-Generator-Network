Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius arrived at a psychiatric unit this morning to begin a month-long series of tests to determine his mental health at the time of his girlfriend's death.

The 27-year-old athlete is on trial for the premeditated murder of Reena Steenkamp, who was shot dead at Pistorius' home on February 14, 2013.

Judge Thokozile Masipa ordered Pistorius to be observed by a four-strong panel of mental health experts at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Pretoria.

Pistorius arrived at the hospital this morning behind a police van to keep the court-ordered appointment.

The athlete is being treated at the hospital as an outpatient and must arrive at the unit each morning by 9am.

The trial, which started on March 3,Â  has been postponed until June 30 to allow a thorough psychiatric evaluation to take place.

Prosecutors claim that Pistorius intentionally shot Ms Steenkamp, 29 through the toilet door of his house following a late-night fight.

Judge Masipa ordered the psychiatric evaluation after defence witness Dr Merryll Vorster said he had diagnosed Pistorius with generalised anxiety disorder.

Dr Vorster said she interviewed Pistorius twice and discovered that he had a long-term fear of crime and felt vulnerable as an amputee.

She argued that the condition may have been a factor when Pistorius short four times through the bathroom door with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun.

Judge Masipa wanted to test Pistorius' mental competency if the defence decides to argue that the runner was not competent due to his mental illness.

A large group of journalists were kept away from the hospital by police.
