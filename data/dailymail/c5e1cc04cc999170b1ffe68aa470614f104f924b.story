The Football Association have named Sean O'Driscoll as the new head coach of the England Under 19 side.

The former Doncaster and Nottingham Forest manager will assist John Peacock as England's young Lions take on European champions Germany in Dusseldorf on Monday evening.

O'Driscoll will then take charge for the European Championship First Qualifying Round games in Luxembourg next month. 

Appointment: The Football Association have named Sean O'Driscoll as the new England Under 19s coach

The 57-year-old has a wealth of experience at management level, most notably in the Championship, where he has taken charge of three clubs in the second tier, but has been without a post since leaving Bristol City in November 2013.

'I am delighted to join The FA as national coach of the U19s team. It gives me a fantastic opportunity to help develop players in this country and I can't wait to get started,' he said.
