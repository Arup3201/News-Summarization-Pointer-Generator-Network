As he dutifully performed Mobots before the race, you would not have guessed Mo Farah was consumed by nerves. Yet he admitted feeling very vulnerable before his hard-fought 10,000m gold last week.

Farah’s personal battles over recent months have given that victory extra significance. So to win the 5,000m title today and scoop a second gold would help eliminate the self-doubt he has felt after health scares and relative failure.

‘I’m not invincible,’ said Farah, ‘I’m just a human being and sometimes you doubt yourself when things are not going quite so well. There are times when I’m struggling and going through different emotions. 

Success: Mo Farah wins the 1000m final at the European Championships in Zurich

Two weeks ago I pulled out the Commonwealth Games and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be all right for the Europeans. You ask yourself questions; “Am I ready?” Physically, you might be ready but mentally you might not be.

‘It would be awesome if I could do the double in Zurich. If I can run a good race and similar to what I’ve run to previous years, then I’d know. I’d say “Yes, you are on the right track.”.’

Four years ago this week in Zurich, Farah became the first Briton to run under 13 minutes for the 5,000m. 

It confirmed his world-class credentials. He calls it a ‘magical place’ and it would be more special if he can harness the wonder of the venue to get back on track.

Farah has been reminded of the fragility of his career by his setbacks. He laughs when asked when he will be going back to the marathon. ‘I haven’t thought about the marathon yet!’ Farah regrets turning to training for the London Marathon after winning the distance double at the World Championships in Moscow last year and his competitive debut over 26 miles was a disappointment as he finished in eighth.

Farah has also endured some ‘scary’ moments this year. He collapsed after the New York Marathon in March and points to four stitches in his left ear sustained when he collapsed after a training run in Utah.

‘It gives you a different outlook on life,’ said Farah, ‘If it was just myself then you wouldn’t think too much about it, but I’ve got kids, I’ve got family. That’s when you think a lot and say to yourself, “Wow”. It’s scary.’

Farah plans to continue for four or five more years before retiring to spend more time with his family.

But his focus is now on the 5,000m final. ‘It would be good to show all my opposition, everyone who knows I’ve been ill, that I’m back,’ he said.
