A shocking video has captured a Florida transit security guard grab an 82-year-old woman by her bag and fling her off a commuter train because he thought she was singing too loudly.

Emma Anderson, from Miami-Dade, says she was singing spiritual hymns when the guard told her to be quiet because she was supposedly disrupting other passengers.

'I was beating my little beads with the bottle and I was singing a song, and he came up to me and said, "Ma'am, you're making too much noise,"' Ms Anderson recalled.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Another passenger decided to record the altercation on his cell phone.

The footage shows Ms Anderson continue singing before the angry guard, who hasn't been named, roughly yanks her from her train seat and flings her out the door by her trolley.

Witnesses can be heard on the tape demanding the security guard tell them his name.

The woman's family says she suffered injuries when she was thrown off the train as she fell backwards trying to keep hold of her bag.

Singing: 'I was beating my little beads with the bottle and I was singing a song, and he came up to me and said, "Ma'am, you're making too much noise,"' Ms Anderson, pictured left with the guard, said

'We took her to the hospital and they took X-rays. Doctors say she has a bruised hip and shoulder,' her son, Kenny Anderson, 42, told ABC News.

Miami-Dade Transit says its policy outlawed singing, dancing or playing music on the train without a permit.

A spokesman defended the guard's heavy-handed actions.

'The elderly passenger, Ms Anderson, was initially asked by a security guard to refrain from singing loudly and playing an instrument while on the train,' they told WPLG in a statement. 'She refused to comply.'

Platform: Ms Anderson can be seen lying on the platform, left, with the guard standing above her after he pulled her so hard

Angry: Rather than being concerned when the old woman hits the floor, the guard appears inconvenienced and says 'oh hell no'

The spokesman claimed the woman's singing was causing a disturbance to other passengers and impeding important train announcements from being heard.

'We regret that Ms Anderson had to eventually be escorted out, but regardless of age, all passengers need to abide by the rules associated with using transit,' the statement read.

But Mr Anderson says the video proves his frail mother was forcibly removed, not 'escorted' off the train. 

'By what we saw on the footage, she was dragged off the train. She wasn't escorted,' he told ABC News. 'She was just singing to the Lord, preaching to the Lord, and he grabbed her bag and drug her off the train.'

The family has hired an attorney and plan to sue the rail company.
