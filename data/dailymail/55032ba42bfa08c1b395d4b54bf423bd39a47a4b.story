Adam Pickup was with friends in Manchester city centre before he left Fab Cafe in Portland Street at around 3.20am

Two men have been arrested after a 17-year-old boy who failed to return home after a night out on Saturday.

Adam Pickup was with friends in Manchester city centre before he left Fab Cafe in Portland Street at around 3.20am.

The teenager from Stockport was last seen on CCTV walking along Oxford Street at about 3.30am.

Footage appears to show him speaking with a man and woman.

Adam
 is described as white, 6ft 2in tall, slim with mousey brown hair. He 
was wearing a maroon long-sleeved collared shirt, black jeans and black 
leather Nike trainers with white soles.

The
 man and woman are described as being white, both with dark hair and 
wearing dark clothing. The man appears to be wearing glasses and a blue 
scarf.

The two men arrested are aged 24 and 25, a police spokeswoman said.

Tonight, a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokeswoman said: 'Police have arrested two men as part of their inquiries to locate the missing man Adam Pickup.

'They are currently in police custody for questioning. Inquiries are ongoing to find Adam and police continue to appeal to anyone who may have seen him or knows of his whereabouts.'

Police have appealed for the public's help to trace Adam and have urged the man and woman to contact them.

Chief Superintendent Chris Sykes said detectives were still treating Adam's disappearance as a missing person investigation.

'As part of our inquiries to locate Adam Pickup we have made two arrests,' he said.

'At
 this stage, it is not clear what involvement, if any, they may or may 
not have had in relation to Adam so we would ask the public not to 
speculate.

'Having said 
that, these two men will be interviewed so we can find out if they know 
anything about Adam's movements on Friday night into Saturday.

'This
 very much remains a missing person investigation and would urge the 
public to get in touch if they have any information about his movements 
that night or his current whereabouts.'

'In particular, while he was walking up Oxford Street Adam appears to be walking alongside a couple and speaking to them.

'If this was you please get in touch and tell us what you know. We are trying to trace Adam's movements and at this point it is not clear what direction he goes in. This couple may have vital information to help us find him.'
