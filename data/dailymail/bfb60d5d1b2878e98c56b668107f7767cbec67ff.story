She’s becoming as well known for stripping off as she is for her music and Miley Cyrus doesn’t disappoint in Future’s Real & True music video.

The 20-year-old pop singer - whose new album Bangerz has topped the US Billboard charts after selling 270,000 copies in its first week - stars as a near naked alien with her modesty only protected by lashings of metallic body paint in the video to accompany her collaboration with the rapper. 

In one scene she is stretched out on a recliner, wearing nothing but paint, as Future, dressed all in black, looks on.

In another scene, the duo get up close and personal and look as if they are about to kiss.

Meanwhile a behind the scenes picture shows both Future, whose nickname is Astronaut Kid, and Mr. Hudson, who also features on the track, dressed as astronauts.

Blonde Miley is covered up in a green boiler suit as they stare at a monitor. 

Future posted a picture to Instagram from the shoot, featuring him blowing smoke out of his mouth. 

The rapper also features on Miley’s new album Bangerz - which beat off competition from Panic! at the Disco and Drake to take the Billboard top spot - on the track My Darlin’ and he revealed her personal woes helped to make the record even better.

Miley has had a tough time in the past few months, topped off by a split from her fiancé Liam Hemsworth after which he was spotted kissing Mexican actress Eiza Gonzalez. 

Future told MTV@ ‘We got a lot of great records, and it all came from conversation and having a nice vibe. Whenever she allowed me in her personal life through conversation, I tried to take that vibe and go to the booth. I told her, 'You've gotta embrace your fears.

'If something's bothering you, you've gotta run toward it. If you're crying about it, you need to cry till you can't cry anymore. If you try to hold it back, then it's gonna eat you up. But if you embrace [it], the music moves.

‘The songs I did with her [are] very touching. Certain days it's about money, partying and vibing and some days [it's about needing] somebody to stand by you and hold you down.

'Certain days you wanna know if the love that you're with is really true, and one song we got is basically around all those subject matters.’

However, things are looking up for Miley who appears to be moving on following her split from Liam, which the pair confirmed last month.

The star is said to be dating Rolling Stone magazine heir Theo Wenner, 26, who is no stranger to dating celebrities as he dated Liv Tyler, 36, in 2011.

According to Radar Miley 'communicates with Wenner several times a day and says the pair are dating, albeit casually’.

'She’s definitely dating him,' a source told the celebrity website. 'Miley talks about how hot Theo is and how nice he’s been to her. She’s definitely completely in lust with him.'
