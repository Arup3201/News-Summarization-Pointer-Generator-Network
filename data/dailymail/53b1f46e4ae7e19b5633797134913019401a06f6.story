Cross-eyed: A distorted image of Mr Shapps in an internet parody after he promoted Budget cuts to bingo

Tory chairman Grant Shapps came under 
fire from his own party last night over a ‘patronising’ advert 
highlighting Budget cuts to bingo and beer duty.

Mr Shapps suffered a ferocious backlash on Twitter after posting the advert in an apparent bid to woo working-class voters.

Downing Street insisted David Cameron had ‘full confidence’ in his party chairman, adding: ‘He thinks he’s doing a good job.’

But
 some Tory MPs said the advert – which sparked dozens of internet spoofs
 yesterday – raised questions about Mr Shapps’s ‘suitability’ for the 
job.

As the row threatened 
to overshadow coverage of the Budget, some even suggested it could lead 
to Mr Shapp being replaced in a reshuffle expected later this year.

Critics said the message reinforced public perceptions that the Conservative Party was out of touch with ordinary voters.

Government sources stressed that responsibility for the advert lay with Mr Shapps rather than the Treasury or No 10.

One
 senior Tory said: ‘When I saw this advert my initial thought was that 
it must be a spoof. My reaction when I realised it wasn’t was one of 
abject horror.’

Another 
exasperated Conservative MP said: ‘Has it boiled down to this? A Grant 
Shapps beer and bingo poster? God help us. It’s like they want us to 
lose.’

'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget

Tweet: The post was immediately slammed as 'ill conceived' by Labour's Ed Miliband

The Tory advert 
read: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking 
people do more of the things they enjoy.’

Mr Shapps urged Conservative 
supporters to ‘spread the word’.

One
 Tory source yesterday said the advert had been ‘pulled’ and would never
 be used again.

But a Tory spokesman insisted it had only ever been 
intended for use on  the internet and was never planned as a poster 
campaign.

The spokesman said: ‘We are quite proud of those tax cuts. We stand by what was said in that advert.

‘There is a misconception about it – it was never going to be a poster campaign, it was just an internet infographic.

‘Some of the Left-wing intelligentsia may not like it but the reaction in bingo halls to the tax cut has been very positive.’

Liberal

 Democrat Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander described the wording
 of the advert as ‘pretty patronising’ and said it ‘demeans some 
quite sensible things’.

Nick
 Clegg added: ‘I think the tweet was a bit silly, partly because the 
issues involved in this Budget were really quite serious.’

London
 Mayor Boris Johnson also declined to support the advert.

‘I didn’t 
write the blooming thing,’ he said.

‘We’re trying to get across the 
message that it’s a Budget for everyone.’

Shadow
 Chancellor Ed Balls said George Osborne must be ‘frustrated that his 
head of campaigns puts out an advert patronising working people by 
saying they’ll be happy with a bingo tax and a beer tax. What nonsense 
that is’.

Simone Blackwell, a writer on political satire The Thick Of It, said the ad was beyond satire

But Mr Osborne 
dismissed the row, saying it had been ‘whipped up by the Labour Party’ 
to disguise the fact they had nothing to say about the Budget.

Mr
 Osborne said he had played bingo.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said 
he did not know when Mr Cameron had last played bingo – or if he had 
ever played it at all.

However, he is known to enjoy a pint of real ale.

The internet was last night awash with spoof versions of Mr Shapps’s advert, which mock it for stereotyping the working class.

One
 posted on Twitter reads: ‘Bingo! No tax on pies, flat caps or whippets –
 keeping our commitment to patronise the working class. Now get off my 
land.’

Another says: ‘Bingo! I say, you there! How is your whippet? Jolly good, jolly good. Carry on.’
