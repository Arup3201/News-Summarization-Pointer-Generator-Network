Tori Spelling has been told she needs to have major spinal surgery but she is stubbornly refusing to have the operation because she fears if she does, her life will spiral out of control more than it already has!

The 41-year-old actress has been suffering from a painful cervical spine condition and needs surgery, but she refuses to go under the knife, fearing that if she’s out of commission, her already troubled marriage to Dean McDermott, 47, will take an even bigger hit.

'Tori has two disintegrated discs in her neck that have been causing her extreme pain,' confides the source.

Worryingly thin: Tori's (pictured in LA last month) shrinking frame has been closely scrutinized over the years, despite the star having denied she is anorexic in the past

Reality check:  Dean McDermott breaks down on True Tori, as he confesses to his wife during their therapy session that their lovemaking was a let down. But behind the scenes they're facing a more critical problem: Tori won't even let Dean talk to her about having the surgery she needs

Although doctors are telling her she risks doing permanent damage if she doesn’t have the surgery, she feels she can’t put her family and her responsibilities on the back burner long enough to have the operation.'

Last month when Tori spent eight days in an LA hospital, her people said it was because of migraine headaches.  And while it’s true she does suffer from debilitating headaches – it’s because of the diseased discs in her neck.

'The pain is so bad she has to take pain medication,' says the source. 'But the longer she takes it, the more meds she has to consume in order to ease the pain. It’s a vicious circle.'

The source adds that Tori feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and to take time off to have surgery, and recover - which could take weeks - means she won’t be able to attend to everything she currently has on her plate.

'Tori feels a lot of pressure to bring money in right now,' says the source. 'She and Dean have been struggling and she knows how important it is for her to keep doing her True Tori reality series, and the new Mystery Girls sit - com she and her old friend Jennie Garth are doing for ABC’s Family Chanel.

Pressure: Tori is afraid that if she spends a week in the hospital, leaving Dean home alone with the four kids, he won't be able to handle it. He's already showing signs of stress

'Tori believes ratings for her reality series would suffer if the story line is forced to center around her hospitalization and recovery, and she knows she has to keep working if the bills are going to get paid.'

Then of course, there's the fact that she’s desperate to repair her troubled marriage.

'Tori and Dean have been working hard on trying to put their marriage back on track after he admitted to cheating,' says the source.'She is still very much in love with her husband and is willing to do anything she can to put the pieces back together.

'She is afraid that if she spends a week in the hospital, leaving him home alone with the four kids, he won’t be able to handle it.

Kid trouble: To add to Tori's woes, she and Dean learned that their six-year-old daughter Stella, who suffered a broken leg a few months back, must now undergo a tonsillectomy

'She also knows that having the operation means she will have to be in bed recovering for a few weeks, putting even more stress and strain on the family and she’s just not willing to do that.'

Dean wants her to take care of herself, but Tori told him not to even bring it up again right now. He is worried about her and feels her painful condition complicates their relationship. But she is so afraid if she drops the ball on all she has to do right now, they will have no chance.

If what is going on the their reality show is any indication of Dean's mental state, he is falling apart. Tori doesn't want to add any stress to their lives. by taking herself out of commission, say the source.

While Tori does worry about her health, her priority is her kids and she and Dean just received word their six year old daughter Stella, who suffered a broken leg a few months back, must now undergo a tonsillectomy.

“Tori knows that Stella will be traumatized by having her tonsils out and she feels she has to be there for her little girl. And it’s just like Tori to put her family’s needs ahead of her own – because all her life, she’s had to be the one who takes care of everyone one else.”

According to another source, Tori basically grew up looking after herself and her younger brother Randy.

Tori and Randy – who is five years her junior – lived a lonely life in their 57,000 square. foot, $85 million mansion in LA’s posh Holmby Hills. Their father, producer Aaron Spelling, was already in his 50’s when the kids were born, and their mother Candy was always involved with charity work and her various hobbies.

The kids lived in a different wing of the house and had to fend for themselves, calling on a cook to bring them a meal or call their parents on the house phone if they wanted to ask them a question. Tori wants to be a  a hands-on parent

Says a family source, 'The family of four lived in the largest house in Beverly Hills, boasting 123 rooms and I remember the kids saying it was like being orphaned living in the big house because while their parents lived in one wing, they were assigned another.'

The kids said that although they were the envy of all their friends, living in a house with a pool, a tennis court, a home theater and a bowling alley, the house felt cold.  They also felt so alone that they would often have to fend for themselves, calling on a cook to bring them a meal or having to call their parents on the house phone if they wanted to ask them a question.

'Tori was like a protective little mother to Randy,' says the source. 'And she was always watching out for him.  And to this day, she tends to put her own needs aside in order to care for her family, even if it means risking her health in order to make sure everyone else in the family is well looked after.'
