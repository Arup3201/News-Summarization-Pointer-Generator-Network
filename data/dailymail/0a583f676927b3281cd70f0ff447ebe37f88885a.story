From the world's mightiest and most elusive creatures, to spectacular landscapes in the farthest flung corners of the globe, National Geographic has been capturing the wonder and diversity of our planet and its inhabitants for more than a century.

The publication is now celebrating its landmark 125th anniversary with a showcase of some of the most iconic and recognizable images to have graced its pages over the years.

The stunning series of photographs span decades and continents, from a trio of men on camels in the shadow of Egypt's pyramids in 1938, to the arresting beauty of a young Afghan refugee captured on camera in Pakistan in 1985.

Founded in 1888, the National Geographic Society is one of the largest non-profit scientific and educational institutions in the world.

It has funded more than 10,000 scientific research, conservation and exploration projects around the globe.

The magazine is celebrating its 125th anniversary

Having started out as a scholarly journal in the 19th Century, the magazine has evolved into a publication that shines a spotlight on distant corners of the globe for millions of readers, with its combination of breathtaking photography and on-the-ground reporting.

Steve McCurry's photograph of young Afghan refugee Sharbat Gula is perhaps the image most associated with National Geographic.

Sharbat, whose piercing green eyes captured the attention of the globe when her solemn face appeared on the cover of the magazine in 1985, was around 12-years-old and living in Pakistan when the picture was taken during Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

For years she was known simply as 'the Afghan Girl', until the photograph's striking subject was formally identified in 2002.

A look back through the National Geographic photo archives offers a glimpse into landmark moments in the history of countries around the world.

One 1963 image features two members of the first U.S. team to reach the summit of Mount Everest trudging through the dazzling white snow as they make their ascent.

The American expedition was sponsored in part by the National Geographic Society, and pioneered a new route to the summit of one of the world's most daunting peaks.

But it is not always humans that feature in the journal's most spectacular photographs.

In many of National Geographic's stunning pictures, it is animals, not people, that take centre stage.

Photographer Paul Nicklen managed to capture a rare 'spirit bear' enjoying a feast of salmon in the rainforest in British Columbia in 2010.

Also known as the Kermode bear, the elusive creature is a variant of the North American Black Bear that is born with white fur.

Another picture reveals an enormous lion, lit up in the African dusk, stares down the lens of the camera as it prepares to bed down for a sleep amid the branches of a fig tree in Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park.

One heart-warming photograph, which captures a fleeting moment of contact between Jane Goodall and a baby chimpanzee, reveals the bond that can exist between animals and humans.

Photographer Hugo Van Lawick snapped the photograph as the chimp, which was named Flint, reached out to Jane at Gombe Stream National Park in western Tanzania.

Now 78, British primatologist Jane famously spent 45 years studying the interactions of wild chimpanzees in Tanzania.
