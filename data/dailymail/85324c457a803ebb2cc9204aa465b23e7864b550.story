There is a photograph of James Troisi alongside Andy Carroll and Fraser Forster in the Stadio Renzo Barbera in Sicily taken in 2006.

The teenage trio were the future of Newcastle United, promoted to the senior squad for a UEFA Cup tie against Palermo.

Show that photo to any Newcastle fan today and they will give you the names of the two boys who went on to become England internationals. As for the third lad, well only reserve-team anoraks could identify him.

Troisi, pictured in 2006, struggled with the Tyneside winter after leaving the 40C heat in Australia 

Travel 10,000 miles or so to Australia, however, and that same player is just about the most recognised sportsman in the country right now.

For James Troisi, now 26 and on the books of Juventus, no less, was the scorer of the winning goal in the final of last month’s Asian Cup to give the Socceroos – including the likes of Tim Cahill and Mile Jedinak - their first piece of major silverware in front of 76, 385 home fans.

In the 48 hours which followed that victory over South Korea, Troisi was everywhere – television, radio, the front and back page of every national newspaper.

Ten years earlier, his family – dad Alby, mum Stacia and younger brother Isaac – took out credit and left home in Adelaide to support the two-footed attacking midfielder in his soccer venture in the North East of England.

He was earning just £100 a week and walked to training every day, where the likes of Michael Owen and Nobby Solano were team-mates. Meanwhile, the Troisi family home in Australia was just two weeks away from being lost to debt collectors.

It is, then, understandable how much that extra-time goal at Sydney’s Stadium Australia meant to Troisi and his family.

‘To make my mum and dad so proud was payback for everything we’ve been through and all of the support they’ve given me, they left everything behind for me when we moved to Newcastle,’ Troisi tells Sportsmail having now returned to Belgian loan club Zulte Waregem, where earlier this season he scored a David Beckham-esque lob from 45 yards which became an internet viral and netted another stunner against Standard Liege which sparked a riot among disgruntled fans.

‘It was massive for Australian football and my name will always be on the goal which won us our first Asian Cup (the equivalent of European Championships).

‘The whole country was celebrating. I’ve never felt like that before. It felt like I was the most famous person in Australia – it was pretty full-on and my phone never stopped.

‘I flew back to Belgium a few days later and back to reality – but scoring that goal was the stuff of dreams.’

So how did the Troisi family end up on Tyneside? When James was 10, Alby set up the Burning Ambition Soccer Academy in Adelaide – which used stick fighting and martial arts to strengthen their youngsters – and during a tour of Europe in 2003 they played Newcastle. Troisi impressed and was invited back for a trial in front of Peter Beardsley and current head coach John Carver. He won the offer of a scholarship and the family took the bold decision to emigrate.

‘It was a dream move and an amazing opportunity, but it was tough,’ he says. ‘It was a big change. We left home in December when it was nearly 40C and then you get to Newcastle and it is freezing.

‘We then nearly lost the house in Australia. My dad got a job as an accountant and my mum worked in Fenwick, the department store in town.

‘It wasn’t until I got my professional contract (a £1,500-per-week deal in 2008) that things got easier.

‘But I was doing well and thought I would make it. Myself, Andy and Fraser were the three players coming through. I was on the bench a lot and training with the big boys every day.

‘I got on really well with Emre (the Turkish international) and he could see I was frustrated at not playing. I needed to move on. Kevin Keegan did me a big favour by waiving the compensation owed to the club and Emre recommended I go to Turkey, where he put a good word in.’

Now 26, the Australian is on the books at Juventus but has been loaned out to co-owned Atlanta

After three years at Newcastle, Troisi signed for Genclerbirligi in the Turkish top flight and during his first season scored a match-winning hat-trick against Keyserispor. His name was noted and top-five Keyserispor duly signed him on a four-year deal.

But Juventus were watching, too.

‘I had four brilliant years in Turkey. I was scoring goals and got a call-up to the national side and then there was word that Juventus were interested,’ says Troisi, who now speaks Italian, Turkish and Greek, although admits his accent still betrays a Geordie twang.

‘It was strange and out of the blue but felt like the recognition I deserved. I went over to Turin, had the tour of the stadium and had my medical there.

‘But the deal was a co-ownership with Atalanta and I was sent there during my first season. I hardly played and it was my lowest time in football, that’s not what I went for.’

Relief came when Juventus bought out his contract for 1million euros and he – and his family - returned to Australia for a loan season at Melbourne Victory - 35 appearances and 15 goals later and he had won a seat on the plane to the World Cup in Brazil.

After thriving at Newcastle, Carroll went on to break transfer records at both Liverpool and West Ham

Troisi was the scorer of the winning goal in the final of last month’s Asian Cup for Australia 

‘I’ve got an Italian and Greek background, so for us it was always football. I remember the 1994 World Cup and being fascinated by Roberto Baggio, but you never think you’ll play at one yourself,’ says Troisi, who played against Lionel Messi, Angel di Maria and Juan Roman Riquelme – the best he has ever faced – at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

‘Our group – Holland, Spain and Chile - was incredibly hard. We didn’t get any points but we didn’t disgrace ourselves and the aim now, for me, is to get to the next World Cup.

‘It’s been some journey so far but I’m still young and I’m excited about the future. Who knows what will happen? There has been a lot of interest recently but I’m pretty open-minded.’

In the meantime he is answerable to Juventus – where his contract expires in 2016 – and the immediate future is chasing European football with Waregem.

There, in a city of just 35,000, he is still relatively unknown, just as he was during three years in Newcastle.

When he returns to his South Adelaide home in the summer, however, the last thing he can expect is anonymity.

For in Australia, Troisi is a national hero.
