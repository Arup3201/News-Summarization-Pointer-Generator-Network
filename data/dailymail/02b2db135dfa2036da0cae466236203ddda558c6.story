Some 30,000 Muslims went to bury their dead today in Srebrenica, the town whose name is now synonymous with genocide.

They travelled to a 
memorial centre in Bosnia, to bury 520 newly identified 
victims - some of the thousands of Muslim men and boys slaughtered in 
July 1995 by Serb forces.

The mass funeral marked the 17th anniversary of Europe's worst massacre since World War II.

The annual ritual was as heartbreaking as ever - Izabela Hasanovic, 27, spent the last minutes crying over one of the coffins before it was lowered into the ground.

Grieving: Some 30,000 Muslims traveled to a memorial center in Srebrenica, in Bosnia today to bury 520 newly identified victims

Time to mourn: Three women grieve beside the coffin of their relative at the Potocari memorial complex near Srebrenica

Last honour: The coffins represented only a small number of the thousands of Muslim men and boys slaughtered in July 1995 by Serb forces

'My father, my father is here,' she sobbed. 'I cannot believe that my father is in this coffin. I cannot accept it!'

Another woman dropped on her knees next to a coffin, pressing her lips against the green cloth covering its wood.

'It's your sister kissing you. It's me,' she whispered to the coffin, caressing it with both hands until others lowered it.

Then the valley echoed with the sound of dirt landing over 500 coffins from thousands of shovels as a voice read out the names of the victims and their ages from loudspeakers.

Among them were 48 teenagers as well as 94-year-old Saha Izmirlic, who was buried next to her son who also died in the massacre.

On the other side of her grave, an empty space is waiting for her grandson who has not yet been found. 

History: Srebrenica was a U.N.-protected Muslim town in Bosnia besieged by Serb forces throughout Bosnia's 1992-95 war

Final goodbye: The bodies of the victims are still being found in mass graves throughout eastern Bosnia. The task has been made even more difficult by the fact that the perpetrators dug up mass graves and reburied remains in other mass graves to try to cover their tracks.

Uncovered: The victims have been identified through DNA analysis and newly identified ones are buried at the Srebrenica memorial center every year. So far 5,325 Srebrenica massacre victims found this way have been laid to rest

Srebrenica was a U.N.-protected Muslim town in Bosnia besieged by Serb forces throughout Bosnia's 1992-95 war. Serb troops led by Gen. Ratko Mladic overran the enclave in July 1995, separated men from women and executed 8,372 men and boys within days.

Dutch troops stationed in Srebrenica as U.N. peacekeepers were undermanned and outgunned and failed to stop the slaughter.

In Washington, President Barack Obama issued a statement honoring the memory of the '8,000 innocent men and boys' massacred in Srebrenica.

'The name Srebrenica will forever be associated with some of the darkest acts of the 20th century,' Obama said, adding that the U.S. 'rejects efforts to distort the scope of this atrocity, rationalize the motivations behind it, blame the victims, and deny the indisputable fact that it was genocide.'

In London, Prime Minister David Cameron said Srebrenica should never be forgotten or denied and called on the world to 'prevent such atrocities from taking place.'

Mladic was arrested last year in Serbia and is on trial now at the tribunal in The Hague. He faces 11 charges, including genocide, for allegedly masterminding Serb atrocities throughout the war that left 100,000 dead, especially the Srebrenica massacre. He denies wrongdoing.

Many Serbs still deny the Srebrenica genocide, including Serbia's newly inaugurated president, Tomislav Nikolic. Some of them view Mladic as a national hero.

Remembrance: People gather at the Potocari memorial complex near Srebrenica, some 160 kilometers east of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina

'Serbs believe he is an honorable and fair man,' said Bosnian Serb Novica Kapuran from the town of Pale, near Sarajevo. 'He is being blamed for something he has not done.'

Tired of political speeches every year, the families of the victims allowed only Holocaust survivor Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Park East Synagogue in New York to address them during Wednesday's ceremony.

'Shalom, Salam,' Schneier greeted the crowd, addressing them as 'brothers and sisters.'

He said the Srebrenica genocide was a crime against humanity but also a crime allowed by the rest of humanity. 'Silence is not a solution, it only encourages the perpetrators and ultimately it pays a heavy price in blood,' Schneier said.

He reminded the audience that even today, the Syrian regime was killing its own people.

'(It's time) for humanity to say in one clear voice: These crimes against people will end!' the rabbi declared. 'Here on this sacred day we say `Never again!' And we mean `Never again!'

The crowd greeted his words with 'Allah Akbar,' or 'God is great' in Arabic.
