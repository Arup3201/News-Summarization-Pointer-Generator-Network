Former Newcastle United star David Ginola insists there is no chance of Louis van Gaal losing the plot with mind games in the Premier League like his old boss Kevin Keegan.

The Frenchman admitted Keegan was left ‘disturbed’ by Alex Ferguson during the title run-in in the 1995/96 season when Newcastle blew a 12-point lead, resulting in the now infamous ‘Love it’ rant.

‘Yes he was [disturbed] because we saw a change in his behaviour,’ Ginola remembered.

‘On a daily basis in training he was nervous. He was a different guy. If I was Louis Van Gaal, with all the things he won in his career, I would smile because you always try to put the stick on someone you think can do great things.

'Try to disturb a guy like him? I think he needs more than that to be disturbed.’

But the Frenchman reckons Van Gaal will only be a success if his players are fully supportive of his methods.

‘The manager brings the spirit in the dressing room and he brings the attitude, momentum and the rules you need to follow. But after that it’s the players who play the game. The players have to stick with the manager.’
