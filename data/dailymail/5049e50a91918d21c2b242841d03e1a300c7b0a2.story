Spain's legendary coach Vicente Del Bosque admitted he may face the axe after the humiliating World Cup exit following the 2-0 defeat by Chile in the Maracana.

It is the first time the reigning champions have been knocked out of the World Cup after just two matches and a number of Spanish players are also facing the chop for the shameful showing.

Chile have qualified from Group B along with Holland after goals from Eduardo Vargas and Charles Aranguiz secured victory while Spain's loss, coupled with last week’s 5-1 defeat by Holland has sent them crashing out.

Lost for ideas: Del Bosque could not inspire his side to repeat their heroics from 2008, 2010 and 2012

New feeling: Del Bosque has been used to success but found himself on the end of two defeats in Brazil

Del Bosque said he need to take time to think about his own future and 'what is good for Spanish football'.

'It’s true that when such things happen during a World Cup or a tournament like this then it has consequences but I don’t want to start thinking about that right now. We have time to analyse that and it is not the right time now.

'There will be time to think and reflect what we are going to do. I think this team is good but we have to take a decision about what is good for Spanish football and that applies to myself as well.'

Del Bosque said Spain had been too timid in the first half against Chile which saw La Roja 2-0 down at the break and with a mountain to climb.

'In the first half we were really shy and sluggish and not brave enough so Chile were able to put the pressure on us.

'In the second half we had more space and some chances but I am trying to find excuses - we played worse than Chile and Holland and so we have lost.'

Chile’s Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli had sympathetic words for Spain, whose winning streak of two European Championships either side of a World Cup has come to a sorry end.

He said: 'In football everything changes. Spain has played very well over the years and had wonderful performances but today that generation of players couldn’t keep that success going, and that’s normal because success is not forever.'

Sampaoli said Chile would now go all out to beat the Dutch and finish top of their group which would avoid a likely meeting with hosts Brazil.

He added: 'Against Holland we will have the same approach knowing we need to win to be first in our group.

'If we don’t win against Holland we will probably have to play Brazil if they win against Cameroon.

'Considering our performances the most important thing is to play as a team - and that’s why we have been so dangerous and have had such good results.'

End of an era: Del Bosque and Fernando Torres are unlikely to be at the Russian World Cup in 2018
