George Zimmerman has avoided domestic violence charges stemming from a bust-up with his girlfriend after she said in a sworn statement that she does not want to pursue the case.

Samantha Scheibe's decision not to cooperate and the lack of other corroborating evidence made it unlikely the prosecution would succeed, State Attorney Phil Archer said on Wednesday.

Zimmerman had faced charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief following an incident at the central Florida house he shared with Scheibe on November 18.

She initially told police Zimmerman pointed a shotgun at her face and smashed up her items, and called 911 saying that she feared for her life.

No charges: George Zimmerman, pictured in November, will not be charged in a recent domestic dispute with his girlfriend in which she claimed he brandished a gun at her and smashed a table

But she then recanted in an affidavit filed this week, stating: 'I do not want George Zimmerman charged... I make this decision freely, knowingly and voluntarily, and without coercion'

Zimmerman, 30, had been barred from seeing or contacting the 27-year-old blonde after he posted $9,000 bond. He was also forced to give up his guns and wear a GPS monitor.

Her affidavit gave a starkly different account of events to Scheibe's original 911 call.

On the day of the argument, she clearly told a dispatcher Zimmerman was 
brandishing a weapon at her, had smashed her glass table with it and then locked her out of her home.

'He's
in my house, breaking all my s--- because I asked him to leave,' 
Scheibe told the operator. 'He's got a freaking gun, breaking all my 
stuff right now.'

She is also heard screaming at Zimmerman: 'You put your gun in my freakin' face... Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house.'

Scheibe reportedly told Zimmerman she was six weeks pregnant but he told her he was leaving

Argument: Zimmerman, pictured leaving jail, may or may not have pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend who had been feeling increasingly scared of him

Scheibe later opened up about the couple's volatile relationship in an 
interview where she detailed Zimmerman's intense depression since he was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin.

However, in late November, sources close to 
Zimmerman claimed Scheibe had made up the incident after allegedly 
faking a pregnancy in a failed bid to stop him leaving her.

Zimmerman began datingÂ Scheibe after she apparently consoled him following his break up with wife, Shellie.

After
Shellie filed for divorce, Zimmerman moved into Scheibe's Seminole 
County home but, according to her, their relationship soon fell apart 
because of his depression.

In an interview, she said she helped him after he spiraled into a very dark place and tried
to kill himself multiple times, once putting a gun in his mouth and 
threatening to pull the trigger.

Scheibe described how he spent days in bed, refusing to get up.

One
day she found him passed out with an empty bottle of sleeping pills on 
his side table. She claims he overdosed and she wasn't able to revive him
but noticed he was still breathing.

Who is the liar: Scheibe, pictured, sounded genuinely scared on the 911 call on the day of the argument

When he did wake, she said he started crying and then put a gun inside his mouth, telling her he was ready to end it all. She said she talked him out of killing himself.

According
to Scheibe, Zimmerman enjoyed the media attention he received from the 
Trayvon case and grew depressed when he wasn't in the headlines.

In
late October, she demanded he get professional help but she said this 
made him angry and he moved all her furniture, clothes and food out of 
her home.

They later made up and he moved her things back into the house. But the relationship remained 
volatile, leading up to the 911 call in November.
