A new German football shirt bearing four stars for Germany's four World Cup wins had sold out on Monday within hours of the team's triumph in Brazil.

The German team snatched victory against Argentina late on Sunday with a goal in extra time in Rio de Janeiro. It was the first time Germany has been champion in the soccer tournament since the country reunified in late 1990.

German sportswear maker Adidas - who had made a small batch ahead of the final in case Germany won - is already seeing the benefits, with customers flocking to its Frankfurt store on Monday in a bid to get one of the new white shirts.

Andre 
Langer was one of the customers lucky enough to get his hands on a 
replica of the number '19' shirt worn by Mario Gotze, who scored the 
winning goal.

'My son will get this shirt - which of course has four stars on it - for his 18th birthday. He's one-year-old now,' he said.

On Monday morning Adidas' website was already displaying a 'sold out' sign next to the new shirts.

Germany
 were crowned world champions on Sunday night and Adidas 
wasted no time in commemorating the achievement - by revealing a kit 
with four stars above the badge.

Joachim
 Low guided Die Mannschaft to their fourth World Cup triumph with a 1-0 
extra-time victory over Argentina at the Maracana Stadium.

And
 to rub salt further into La Albiceleste's wounds, the first time that 
Low's side will wear the new kit will be against Argentina in a friendly
 on September 3 at the Esprit Arena in Dusseldorf.

German 
manufacturers Adidas were quick to ensure that their national football 
team's success was clearly embroidered on their jersey as they tweeted a
 picture with four stars on the shirt.

The sportswear giant also revealed that the new jerseys will be available for Germany supporters to purchase later this week.

Katja
 Schreiber of the Adidas Group tweeted a photo accompanied by the 
caption: 'Spotted at adidas HQ: first #GER jerseys with four stars. New 
jersey will be available later this week. #allin.'

Substitute Mario Gotze's superb 113th-minute strike was enough to defeat Lionel Messi and Co in Rio de Janerio.

Die Mannschaft previously won three World Cups as West Germany in 1954, 1974 and 1990.
