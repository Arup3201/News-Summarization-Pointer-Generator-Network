It's good news for dads who feared their days of roaring along in a sports car were behind them.

Jaguar is building its first 4x4 – and there’s plenty of room for the kids.

The British firm today announced 1,300 new jobs to help it create the five-door, five-seater sports utility vehicle, which will cost around £38,000.

The Jag for dads: The forthcoming Jaguar F-PACE four-wheel-drive family car 

‘She-Type’ Jaguar: More practical than the sleek saloons and super-charged sports cars the firm is known for, it is also designed to appeal to busy mums on the school run

Firmly aimed at ‘Jag dads’ with children to ferry around, the all-wheel drive car will come with extra grip technology, meaning it’s safe and reliable in all weathers.

More practical than the sleek saloons and super-charged sports cars the firm is known for, it is also designed to appeal to busy mums on the school run – for whom it has been dubbed the ‘She-Type’ Jaguar.

To keep the youngsters entertained during longer journeys, the car will also feature on-board wi-fi and a Meridian digital audio system.

It will officially be called the F-PACE when it goes on sale in 2016, as a British rival to Germany’s Porsche Macan and BMW X4 crossover. Jaguar’s bosses made the announcement in Detroit last night ahead of the North American International Auto Show, which begins today.

Design director Ian Callum said: ‘The F-PACE is our family sports car. It will encapsulate everything that Jaguar stands for – beautiful design, precise handling, a supple ride, luxurious interior finishes and cutting-edge technology.’

Speaking in Detroit, Jaguar Land Rover global sales director Andy Goss said: ‘In 2015 we will celebrate Jaguar’s 80th year. We have started it by announcing our first performance crossover which we consider to be the ultimate practical sports car. It builds on the marque’s founding ideals of Grace, Pace and Space. It will be one of the most innovative Jaguars we’ve ever developed.’

But drivers who want even more power can opt instead for the three-litre V6 engine used in the two-seater Jaguar F-Type.
