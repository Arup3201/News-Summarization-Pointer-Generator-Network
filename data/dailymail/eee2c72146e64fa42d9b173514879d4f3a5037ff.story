Smiling as he pets a baby goat in his lap, James 'Whitey' Bulger could not look further removed from the tough reputation he established throughout his decades-long crime spree.

The image of the notorious Boston mobster is just ones of the many never-before-seen photographs released by his lawyers, who may ask the judge if they can present them as evidence in his trial.

The pictures, charting his life from his teen years to middle age, could be an attempt by Bulger's defense team to paint the alleged murderer, who is now 83, in a more sympathetic light.

They show no trace of the suffering he inflicted as he allegedly killed 19 people, laundered money, distributed drugs and extorted victims.

Different life: An image of notorious Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, released by his defense lawyers, shows him petting a goat in an insight into his life before his capture in 2011

Photographs from his youth present him as a confident teenager at a time when he was already gaining a reputation in South Boston as a street fighter and thief.

Later images show him grinning alongside Boston
Bruin Chris Nilon and the Stanley Cup, sitting shirtless in the sun, 
and petting the dogs he shared with girlfriend Catherine Greig.

Greig,
who was captured with Bulger in 2011 and is serving an eight-year 
prison sentence for helping him during his crime spree, makes numerous 
appearances throughout the photographs.

The couple are snapped walking the dogs together or petting parrots.

Greig has said she does not regret her life on the run with Bulger as she still loves him.

Another image shows Bulger with the former vice chancellor of the Boston archdiocese, Frederick J. Ryan, who allegedly sexually abused teenage boys at Catholic high school in the 1980s.

'Given Whitey Bulger's lack of respect for humanity, it comes as no surprise that Whitey Bulger is associated with a serial pedophile such as Fred Ryan,' attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented two of Ryan's victims in 2002, told the Boston Globe.

Ryan, who was ordained in 1964, was defrocked by the Vatican in 2006 after he was accused of taking two Catholic Memorial students to the chancery to molest them.

Bulger faces allegations that he took 
part in 19 slayings while leading Boston's Irish mob over a decades-long
crime spree throughout the 1970s and 80s.

Prosecutors claim he was also a FBI informant trading information on Italian Mafiosi in exchange for protection from crooked FBI agents - but Bulger has denied this, as well as killing two women, Debbie Davis and Deborah Hussey.

On Wednesday, prosecutors pushed to know whether he would testify in his own defense, saying he has had time to think about it - but they didn't get an answer before court adjourned.

Bulger's lawyer, J.W. Carney, told the court that he expects to call 15 witnesses to the stand, but added: 'That may not be the limit to the defense.'

Before the long-awaited trial began on June 6, Carney told reporters he expected his client would take the stand.

But
in his opening statements, he made no mention to the jury that they 
would hear from Bulger himself and he has been silent about whether the 
gangster would face cross-examination.

Richard Sunday, a friend of Bulger's who has received letters from him since his capture, said the mobster 'always preached he wanted his day in court' and vowed to tell his story and clear his name.

'If he doesn’t testify about what he knows, the world will know he’s a rat,' Sunday told the Boston Globe.

Tommy Donahue, whose father is among Bulger's alleged victims, said he is eager to see him testify.

He says Bulger still has a chance 'to try to save any name he has left' by possibly exposing some law enforcement corruption.

Arrest: Bulger is accused of killing 19 people, extortion, money laundering and drugs distribution. It is not yet known whether he will testify at his trial, which has already been underway for nearly two months
