Mr Duncan Smith said officials had kept him in the dark about problems

Iain Duncan Smith accused his own civil servants of a lack of ‘professionalism’ yesterday as the row deepened over the Government’s troubled  welfare reforms.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said he had ‘lost faith’ in the ability of Whitehall mandarins to deliver the  flagship Universal Credit scheme, and had now turned to outside experts.

Mr Duncan Smith said officials had kept him in the dark about problems with the £2.4billion scheme, which was severely criticised by the National Audit Office yesterday.

He said some officials ‘did not tell the truth’ about how the project was going.

In a devastating report, the Whitehall spending watchdog said Universal Credit has been beset by ‘weak management, ineffective  control and poor governance’.

The scheme, which will replace a string of out-of-work benefits, is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours.

The NAO said the complex project, which so far has only been tested in pilot schemes, has ‘not achieved value for money’ – and suggested plans to extend it nationally by 2017 should be delayed.

But, in a finding that was seized on by Mr Duncan Smith, the watchdog also accused officials of developing a ‘fortress mentality’ and a culture of only passing on good news.

He insisted the scheme would be delivered ‘on time and in budget’, despite problems with the computer system that have already led to £34million of equipment being written-off.

The BBC reported yesterday that a further £162million could be written off in the coming weeks.

Former chancellor Alistair Darling accused him of ¿blaming all those around him for letting him down¿

Mr Duncan Smith said he had intervened last year to bring in new managers to get the project back on track.

‘I never expected to have to do that,’ he told the Commons. ‘When I arrived, I expected professionalism to be able to do this.’

His comments angered Labour MPs, who said Mr Duncan Smith should take responsibility for the problems with the project.

Former chancellor Alistair Darling accused him of ‘blaming all those around him for letting him down’.

He added: ‘I’ve listened to you, claiming that this is on track and in budget, which I find extraordinary since the National Audit Office says this is anything but.’

Mr Darling said he had looked at a similar scheme when he was in Government and been warned it would be ‘technically difficult, if not impossible, to deliver at a reasonable cost’.

Labour MP Andrew Miller told Mr Duncan Smith: ‘Can I remind you that it was you who signed off the contract which led to those project management failures. So, rather than simply blaming civil servants, why don’t you accept the blame yourself?’

During angry exchanges Labour work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne suggested Mr Duncan Smith had misled the public and MPs by repeatedly claiming the project was going well, despite major concerns behind the scenes. He urged him to apologise.

Referring to Mr Duncan Smith’s description of himself as ‘the Quiet Man’ when he was Tory leader, Mr Byrne said: ‘The Quiet Man must not become the Cover-Up Man.’

Mr Duncan Smith snapped back that Mr Byrne’s criticisms were ‘pathetic’.

He was backed by Downing Street yesterday, which said it was confident the 2017 target would be met, despite a string of delays.

The NAO report underlines concerns within Whitehall that the Government’s biggest single reform is in danger of going off track.

The report found the IT system could not identify potentially fraudulent claims, meaning manual checks were needed on claims and payments. ‘Such checks will not be feasible or adequate once the system is running nationally,’ it added.

Mr Duncan Smith insisted that all of the report’s concerns had already been addressed.

The civil service is a ‘failing organisation’ that needs sweeping reforms to bring it into the 21st century, MPs warned last night.

The Commons public administration committee said in a report that Whitehall mandarins were ‘in denial’ about the scale of the problems facing an organisation once likened to a Rolls-Royce machine.

MPs said Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude was right to try to reform the civil service, but his plans were ‘too modest and piecemeal’ and were ‘bound to fail’.

The convention of ministers  taking responsibility for major mistakes in their department has gone and there is an ‘atmosphere’ of  ministers blaming officials and  vice versa.

The result is that ‘few ministers or officials seem to be held accountable when things go wrong’.

The report said: ‘The civil service exhibits the key characteristics of a failing organisation in which most people know the system is failing, where nobody knows how to address failure, and the leadership are in denial about the scale of the challenge they face.’

MPs called for a Parliamentary committee to be established to address the problems from scratch.
