The signing of Alexis Sanchez had Arsenal fans jumping for joy at the prospect of the new season, much like the players in training.

Arsene Wenger returned from his World Cup media duties in Brazil to prepare for the club's upcoming season. Their first friendly match is against Borehamwood on Saturday, a fixture they play every summer.

Arsenal's standout performer last season was undoubtedly Aaron Ramsey, and the 23-year-old believes the squad are in a good to progress after their FA Cup victory.

Jumping for joy: Ramsey is put through his paces in pre-season training

Master and the pupil: Ramsey has promised Wenger and the fans that he will improve even further this season

Like a new signing: Diaby returns from injury and Coquelin returns from Freiburg

'I think we have a great opportunity,' the Welshman told Arsenal.com. 'Hopefully all the people that have played at the World Cup come back strong and fit and we can hit the ground running when the season starts.

'The feeling we got after winning the FA Cup was something special and I’m sure that everybody wants the same thing again this season. We’ll be giving it everything to win a few things this year.

'The media were always saying things like "Arsenal haven’t won a trophy for this many years". The number kept getting higher so it was important to win something to take that burden away. It takes the pressure off us.

'I think the team has come on a long way in the last couple of seasons. We’ve grown a lot - there’s a great team spirit here, everybody wants to work for each other so we’ll give it a good go.'

Safe hands: Szczesny was kept out of Arsenal's FA Cup run last season by the now departed Fabianski

High hopes: Gedion Zelalem and (right) Chuba Akpom will both be hoping to break in to the first team in 2014/15

Backup: Monreal has had mixed fortunes at Arsenal and Gibbs emerged as the clear favourite last season

Challenge: Flamini takes no prisoners as he competes for the ball with Ramsey

Unlucky: Many Arsenal fans considered Gibbs extremely unlucky not to be taken to Brazil, especially considering Baines's performances
