Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal meet in the north London derby on Saturday lunchtime with a place in the top four at stake.

The hosts trail the fifth-placed Gunners by just two points and would leapfrog them and jump into a Champions League berth with victory.

In-form Arsenal, though, will be out to extend a five-match winning run in which they have kept four clean sheets.

Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the strength of the rivals and picks our best XI from the two squads...

GOALKEEPER – HUGO LLORIS

If Arsene Wenger doesn’t fancy Wojciech Szczesny then we can’t either. That leaves David Ospina competing with Lloris for the No.1 jersey and, for us, there’s no contest. Sweeper-keeper Lloris not only bails his backline out with his hands, but he’s also pretty useful with his feet, repeatedly vacating his penalty area to avert danger. He’s arguably the best keepers in the Premier League.

RIGHT BACK – MATHIEU DEBUCHY

Neither team is blessed with great quality in this area. Kyle Walker has failed to mature into the England regular we thought he would, while Arsenal’s Calum Chambers has not made the impact expected of him at the Emirates this season and has been out of the side during their recent good form. That leaves Debuchy as the default selection, but even then it is a reluctant one given his injury record this season. On his day, however, he is aggressive in both defence and attack and the best north London has to offer.

CENTRE BACKS – JAN VERTONGHEN & LAURENT KOSCIELNY

Spurs’ Vertonghen is the obvious pick to marshal the rearguard. The Belgian is a class act and one of the first names on the team-sheet at White Hart Lane. Federico Fazio has started to impress of late but it is Arsenal’s Koscielny who gets the nod to partner Vertonghen. He is a far safer bet than Per Mertesacker, who has struggled for form this season in the wake of his World Cup triumph with Germany.

LEFT BACK – KIERAN GIBBS

There’s not a great deal between Gibbs and Danny Rose. Both are pacey, join the attack at every opportunity and boast great recovery at the other end. But it is Gibbs who gets the nod. Were it not for injuries then he would have established himself as England’s best left back and, given Luke Shaw’s failure to impact at Old Trafford this season, Gibbs, at 25, could make the position his own should he maintain his fitness.

RIGHT MIDFIELD – ALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN

Andros Townsend is still struggling to build on last season’s breakthrough and the jury remains very much out on his credentials as a top Premier League player. But at Arsenal there is no doubting that Oxlade-Chamberlain is the real deal. England were robbed of the daring and direct dribbler at the World Cup and, at his best, he should be a certain starter for both club and country.

CENTRAL MIDFIELD – AARON RAMSEY

There are a host of candidates to fill the central-midfield berth, not least Ryan Mason, who has been outstanding for Spurs this season. Francis Coquelin is beginning to make a similar impact with the Gunners, while Jack Wilshere was proving his critics wrong before injury struck, again. But it is the class and composure of Ramsey which wins him the role in the middle of the park. With just six goals this season he should be offering more in that department, but the Welshman is the heartbeat of the side and one of the best midfielders in the division.

ATTACKING MIDFIELD – CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN

Again, we are spoilt for choice in this domain. Santi Cazorla showed his silk during the recent win at Manchester City and is a pleasure to watch at his best. Consistency, though, remains a concern with the Spaniard, as it does with team-mate Mesut Ozil, who, while mesmerising on his day, defines ‘flaky’ in the games in which he goes missing, and that happens far too often. This position, then, belongs to just one man – Christian Eriksen. The Dane has been nothing short of incredible this season and has 11 goals already, proving the match-winner on countless occasions.

LEFT MIDFIELD – THEO WALCOTT

Nacer Chadli has found his feet this season after a difficult first campaign. Walcott, however, remains the best threat from a wide position on the books at either North London club. Since returning from injury he has proved his worth and his devastating pace – allied to an increasing composure – makes Walcott an invaluable asset.

SECOND STRIKER – ALEXIS SANCHEZ

You could put the Chilean anywhere across the frontline and he would terrify the opposition. His debut season in the Premier League has been mightily impressive, not least because he marries graft to his craft. His return of 18 goals speaks for itself and Sanchez is looking like the signing of the season. Remind us why Barcelona let him go?

Alexis Sanchez has enjoyed a brilliant start life at Arsenal and has scored 18 goals in all competitions

STRIKER – HARRY KANE

The 21-year-old has seen them all off at White Hart Lane and Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor cannot get close to what Kane offers the team in terms of goals and overall contribution. He has 20 goals this term and is undoubtedly the biggest success story of the season so far. Rivalling him for our No 9 jersey are OIivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck, but a return of eight and seven goals respectively means Kane gets the pick, just as he should do when Roy Hodgson names his next England team.

Harry Kane has been a revelation this season, scoring more goals than any other Premier League player
