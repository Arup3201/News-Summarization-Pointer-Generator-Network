Steven Gerrard insists Brendan Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool into next season’s Champions League.

After going so close to winning the Premier League title last term, Gerrard concedes another title tilt is beyond his side.

The Reds skipper says the club must now focus their attentions on retaining their top-four status as they look to secure another campaign in Europe’s premier club competition.

But that task looks easier said that done with the Merseysiders way off the pace in the race for a Champions League position.

Liverpool’s turbulent campaign has seen Rodgers’ position as manager come under growing scrutiny in recent weeks.

But Gerrard insists Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool’s future, saying: ‘We’re still moving forward, I really believe that. I’m the first to admit it’s been tough this season, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster.

‘But no-one in the dressing room has lost confidence in the manager. We are all behind him, we all believe in him. It will take time.

‘But I have that belief. We are a strong dressing room with a good manager - it will only be a matter of time before we turn it around. I’ve got confidence it will happen.’

Rodgers makes his point to his Liverpool players as they prepare to face Arsenal

Gerrard and Liverpool host Arsenal on Sunday in hope of kick-starting their disappointing league campaign.

And the Reds captain added: ‘We want top four. That’s always our bread and butter.

‘After the start we’ve had I think it will be a fantastic achievement if we can get in that top four.

‘We’re not happy with our position in the table at the moment. But if we can come through a big game against Arsenal and get a win then that could be the catalyst for us to go on a run of results.

‘There are a lot of league games over the Christmas period. If you can string three or wins togther it can get you up there knocking on the door. ‘We’ve got to keep fighting for that because it’s so important to this club. That’s the main aim, no doubt about it.

‘And on top of that if we can try and get a cup along the way that would be a very welcome bonus because this club is about winning trophies.’
