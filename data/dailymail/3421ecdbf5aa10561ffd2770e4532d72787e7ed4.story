Boris Johnson today lashed out at Home Secretary Theresa May for watering down strict anti-terror powers which may have helped ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi escape the net and travel to Syria.

The London Mayor accused his Tory leadership rival of giving the 'benefit of the doubt' to terror suspects like Emzawi – identified yesterday as the London-raised ISIS executioner known until now as 'Jihadi John'.

Mr Johnson's astonishing attack comes amid growing controversy over who is to blame for MI5's failure to stop 'known wolf' Emwazi leaving Britain for the front line in Syria in 2013.

Boris Johnson today lashed out at the Home Secretary Theresa May for making it easier for terrorists like Mohammed Emwazi to escape justice

The extremist, who was brought up in west London, was subject to a no fly order and was on a terror watch list but still managed to leave without detection.

He was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up in 2007 to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab.

The Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson today admitted MI5 may have 'slipped up'.

But he said: 'One won't know until there's been an inquiry or a report of some kind.'

London's police chief this afternoon defended MI5, adding: 'You can't plea bargain with evil.'

But experts believe Emwazi was helped to escape Britain by his terror associates who had been allowed back to London by the Government in 2011.

Experts say he is likely to have been aided with money, a false identity and bogus travel documents by a London jihadi cell which he had belonged to since 2009.

Three members of the cell had been kicked out of London under Labour's control order regime, but were allowed to return in 2011 when Mrs May scrapped them.

The power to relocate terror suspects was finally reintroduced a fortnight ago, under growing pressure from the security services.

Speaking this afternoon, Mr Johnson slammed the 2011 'mistake' to scrap the 'internal exile' powers contained in Labour's control order regime.

The Mayor of London said: 'We need to keep a very, very close eye on these people.

'The decision to modify the control orders, to water them down I think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able, when you are controlling these people to be able to relocate them, to take them away from their support networks and look after them, to monitor them properly.

'We are now back on the right track and it just confirms to me the vital importance of us being able to monitor these people, to keep tabs on them, to look at what they are saying to each other in their email, their electronic contact.'

Mr Johnson added: 'The politicians who made that mistake need to think very carefully about why they did it and I think that the balance, the benefit of the doubt was, I am afraid, given too much to those who wish us serious harm.

'This whole thing needs to be tackled very, very robustly.

'We need to have a very strong security response that gives our people, gives our security services and the police the surveillance powers that they need.'

The former head of Britain's terror powers watchdog David Anderson admitted Emwazi had 'a couple of associates… who were under control orders' before Mrs May scrapped them.

He said he was not surprised that MI5 was aware of Emwazi but had failed to stop him from travelling overseas.

'I'm afraid it's not surprising to me at all. I do spend time with the intelligence agencies and with the police. They are very busy at the moment and they were very busy then. There are a lot of people that they're a bit suspicious of - there are hundreds, probably thousands.'

He added: 'You can't round all those people up without a trial and declare that they're subject to some form of house arrest. You need at the very least to be sure that they have participated in terrorism before you start taking measures like that.

Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette cooper shadow today backed the London Mayor's attack on Mrs May.

She said: 'We warned the Government from the start not to abolish control orders. I said in Parliament many times that those relocation powers were immensely important and that removing them would make it easier for terror suspects to organise.'

The Labour shadow minister added: 'At the very least, the Prime Minister should ask the Intelligence and Security Committee to examine the period following the scrapping of relocation.

'Parliament needs to know whether the legislation to alter counter terror powers affected the UK's ability to prevent people travelling to Syria.

'The Home Secretary has a duty to protect national security, so if the decisions she made on legislation against expert advice have weakened national security instead, the public and Parliament have a right to know.'

Jihadi John was named in High Court  as key player in UK terror funding network TWO YEARS before he vanished

Jihadi John was named in the High Court by the Home Secretary as being part of a terror funding network two years before he vanished from Britain despite being on a MI5 watchlist, it was revealed today.

Court papers name Mohammed Emwazi as part of a notorious gang of Islamists called the London Boys 'provision of funds and equipment to Somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity'.

This included allegedly raising cash to send people to terror training camos in Somalia. Emwazi was known to be trying to get to Somalia in 2009 and MI5 accused him of trying to join Al Shabaab. 

The London Boys were being monitored by the security services from as early as 2007, and Emwazi was himself interrogated by MI5 in 2009, but was still able to flee to Syria in 2012.

Revealed: This court document from 2011 reveals that two years before he fled for Syria Mohammed Emwazi - Jihadi John -  was known by the Government and believed to be part of a terror gang called the London Boys

Emwazi's name is on paperwork relating to a control order for a terror suspect known as CE, among at least 13 others linked to Somalia and Al Shabaab including some of the world's most notorious terrorists.

CE attended an Al Qaeda training camp led by Harun Fazul and Saleh Nabhan, a leading Al Qaeda figure suspected of involvement in the 1998 US embassy bombings in east Africa.

Files leaked by WikiLeaks showed how Bin Laden sent messages to these men from his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, to other Al-Qaeda members in Somaliaand told them to carry out more attacks on the West. 

Fazul was named by Guantanamo Bay detainees as leader of Al Qaeda's African unit and trained number of Britons at a terror factory in Mogadishu. 

Saleh Nabhan was the mastermind behind two of East Africa's worst terror atrocities: the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 250, and the 2002 attempt to bring down an Israeli airline with Stinger missiles. 

He was known to be close to the White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite, who was the wife of 7/7 London terrorist bomber Germaine Lindsay.

The government stripped both Fazul and Nabhan of their British passports and they were killed in separate drone attacks in 2012. 

Also on the list was an extremist who can be identified only as J1 – an Ethiopian accused of being a member of Al Shabaab and a close associate of one of four bombers who attempted to cause mass casualties on the London Underground on July 21, 2005.

On his return to Britain, Emwazi's comrade CE was tasked with recruiting others to join Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab. 

The group also included Hamza Chentouf and Mohammed Ezzouek, who along with CE were interrogated by British intelligence officers in Kenya.

Ezzouek and Chentouf were rescued from Somalia 
in 2007 after they were imprisoned while trying to flee after the US 
ordered air strikes on Islamists who took over Mogadishu.

The 
Foreign Office spent tens of thousands of pounds on a jet to bring them 
home. They denied accusations of being involved in the London Boys gang.
