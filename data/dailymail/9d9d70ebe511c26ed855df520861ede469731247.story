There were echoes of Harald Schumacher's infamous pole-axing of Patrick Battiston as Manuel Neuer clattered in to Gonzalo Higuain in Sunday night's World Cup final.

True, the giant German goalkeeper got the ball as he came out to punch clear early in the second half, but as his flying floored the Argentina strike, thoughts immediately turned to the 1982 World Cup semi-final.

Then-Germany keeper Schumacher was nowhere near the ball when he took Battiston out, with the referee somehow not awarding a free-kick after the ball had trickled wide.

Painful memories: Another German goalkeeper, Harald Schumacher, pole-axed Patrick Battiston in 1982

Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli came up with a baffling decision early in the second half when Manuel Neuer clashed with Gonzalo Higuain.

The Germany goalkeeper had every right to go for the ball with his fist, made a clean connection and his follow-through was natural. He inadvertently cleaned out Higuain but there was no case for a penalty.

For some observers it may have brought back memories of West German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher’s awful challenge on Patrick Battiston of France in a 1982 semi-final (above). But it was nothing like it for dangerous play.

However, why Rizzoli decided to award Germany a free-kick was a mystery. A throw-in to Argentina would have been the right choice.

Pain: Higuain couldn't believe a free-kick was given against him after the collision

There were similarly farcical scenes at the Maracana as referee Nicola Rizzoli concluded to award Neuer the free-kick despite Higuain's eyes never leaving the ball nor his feet or arms leaving the ground.

⁮Higuain, thankfully, escaped unharmed, unlike Battiston who lost teeth and damaged vertebrae.
